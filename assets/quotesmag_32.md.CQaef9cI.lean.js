They are best known for their songs \\"All of This\\" and \\"Like a Fool,\\" which appeared in Guitar Hero and Rock Band 2, respectively. The band made an appearance in the 2010 film The Roommate, which features the songs \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Tie You Down\\" and includes on-screen performances by Brousseau, Brown and Raassina as members of actor Cam Gigandet's fictional band. As of 2010, Shaimus resided in Los Angeles. Background Shaimus formed in November 2004 when all five original members attended Berklee College of Music. The band moved to Los Angeles, where they released two self-produced albums independently. Shaimus licensed their first album's music to MTV and signed a publishing deal with North Star Media in 2009, leading to song placements on TV shows such as One Tree Hill and the 2010 film The Roommate. They signed a \\"Friends\\" deal with MySpace Music the same year, which led to their music video for \\"Like a Fool\\" being featured on the front page of the MySpace Music site. In early 2009, original guitarist Dave Middleton quit the band. He was replaced by lead singer Phil Beaudreau's brother, Lou, a few months later. Shaimus embarked on West Coast tours in 2006 and 2009. The Seattle PI's \\"Big Blog\\" recommended them as one of their top 8 weekend ideas in November 2009. Guitar Hero and Rock Band Phil Beaudreau and Johannes Raassina worked in the QA department at Harmonix Music Systems while living in Boston. Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, the Shaimus song \\"All of This\\" was featured as a bonus track in the first Guitar Hero video game in 2005 and for download in Rock Band. In 2008, \\"Like a Fool\\" was featured as one of 20 free downloads for the Harmonix game Rock Band 2. Musical style Stylistically, the band calls themselves alternative rock.

The Internet-based show is created and hosted by the Green brothers: John Green and Hank Green. The first incarnation of the brothers' online broadcasting was the \\"Brotherhood 2.0\\" project, preceding the establishment of the pair's regular vlogging activity through the Vlogbrothers channel. The Vlogbrothers channel was the first in what would become a larger portfolio of YouTube channels created and developed by the Greens, sparking a community of fans and supporters of Vlogbrothers, known individually as Nerdfighters, and collectively as Nerdfighteria. Subscribers of the brothers on YouTube are the base of the online community Nerdfighteria. The Green brothers encourage their viewers to become a community by creating websites and various projects, like the Project for Awesome, as a way to engage with their subscribers. Legally, Vlogbrothers is owned by Complexly (formerly named EcoGeek LLC), which was originally solely owned by Hank, but now jointly owned by both Greens. Format and schedule The Greens state that their vlog has no consistent format: \\"Really, it's not about anything in particular. Whether we're talking about our lives, making each other laugh, or trying to get something more important across, people seem to enjoy it.\\" The channel passed one million subscribers on March 5, 2013. As of 2020, the brothers post two videos per week onto their Vlogbrothers channel. John Green posts a video on Tuesday, and Hank Green on Friday. Brotherhood 2.0 project The Green brothers, strongly inspired by the show with zefrank, devised the Brotherhood 2.0 project late in 2006. The project was launched on January 1, 2007, based on the premise that the brothers would cease all text-based communication for one year and, instead, converse by video blogs every weekday. The project was made available to the public on YouTube, with John's first video on his original channel \\"sparksflyup,\\" as well as through the brothers' own Brotherhood 2.0 website. On July 18, 2007, Hank Green uploaded a video of himself playing and singing his song \\"Accio Deathly Hallows\\" in honor of the seventh Harry Potter book. This video was the first Vlogbrothers video to make the front page of YouTube, and the starting point of the brothers' success as vloggers. Toward the end of 2007, the brothers launched the first Project For Awesome campaign, in which YouTubers created innovative videos promoting their favorite charity, with the aim that their promoted charity gains more awareness, and donations from viewers. The Brotherhood 2.0 Project ended on December 31, 2007. However, the brothers decided to continue uploading videos on YouTube due to their popularity and growing fan base. Post-Brotherhood 2.0 The Vlogbrothers in 2008 In their December 31, 2007 video, the brothers revealed their decision to continue vlogging even though the project had ended. Following the conclusion of Brotherhood 2.0, a website was set up for their community, known as Nerdfighters. The website was originally maintained solely by Hank Green, but is now updated and moderated by a group of community volunteers known as the \\"Ningmasters\\". New projects, videos, discussions, groups and forums entirely made by the Vlogbrothers fan community are uploaded daily. The brothers' videos continue to be the basis of the online community known as \\"Nerdfighteria\\". Continuing the trend of their previous charitable endeavors, the Greens rallied their viewers to make micro-donations on Kiva.org. The Nerdfighters lending team was launched in September 2008. As of March 2015, the Kiva Nerdfighters group ranks 7th on the site for total money loaned through total domestic and international microloans. It has roughly 48,000 members who have loaned a collective total of over $5.3 million. On January 20, 2010, John Green went on paternity leave, and Maureen Johnson made videos in his place until his return the following month, when he introduced his son, Henry. Hank Green was interviewed by Forbes in May 2011. During 2011 and 2012, the Green brothers had their Vlogbrothers videos consistently featured on media outlets such as CBS News and Huffington Post. On September 14, 2012, Hank Green made a video celebrating the 1000th video on the Vlogbrothers channel that commemorated the brothers' experiences over the previous 5 years. One million subscribers, continued growth and ten years on YouTube (2013‚Äìpresent) A Vlogbrothers video featuring both Hank and John Green On January 15, 2013, they featured in \\"An Evening of Awesome at Carnegie Hall\\" celebrating the anniversary of John's novel The Fault in Our Stars. The two-hour live streamed event also featured The Mountain Goats, Kimya Dawson, and Neil Gaiman. In February, John Green participated in a Google+ Hangout with Barack Obama during which John's wife, Sarah Urist Green, also appeared. Prior to this, she had not been seen on camera or in any of his blogs, preferring not to join her husband on camera. Her elusive attitude gained her the nickname \\"The Yeti\\". On March 5, the channel hit 1 million subscribers and both brothers live-tweeted the occasion. Later, on June 25, John Green went on paternity leave for the birth of his second child, Alice, and six guest hosts made videos in his place, including Hannah Hart (MyHarto), Grace Helbig (itsgrace), Craig Benzine (wheezywaiter), Rosianna Rojas (missxrojas), and the winners of the \\"Nerd Factor\\" competition: YouTube users MagicTurtle643 and NerdyAndQuirky. In November, John created a video discussing bullying in general, as well as his personal experience with getting bullied. On September 11, 2015, the Greens began listing all videos on the channel under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license. Hank Green later clarified on Reddit that \\"We didn't mention it, we just switched over. I'm not sure what people would do with a Vlogbrothers video, but I want them to be able to do it.\\" On August 5, 2016, the project \\"How to Vote in Every State\\" was launched. It encourages viewers to register to vote with links to quick, comprehensive videos on how to do so in for each state. In the beginning of 2017, the duo celebrated their ten years on YouTube. In honor of this, they held a one-time convention, NerdCon: Nerdfighteria, that was held in Boston, Massachusetts from February 25-26, 2017. The convention celebrated the duo's YouTube career and the Nerdfighteria community. On October 22, 2019, the Green brothers launched a project with Partners in Health to improve maternal health in Sierra Leone. Reception The Greens were able to find a dedicated audience, with Christian Today detailing \\"their message, celebrating nerdiness, education, science, and imagining others complexly, has resonated loudly across the globe.\\" Margaret Talbot of The New Yorker has praised the topics of the video blogs, describing, \\"The tone of their monologues ranged from goofily informative... to wonkish.\\" Talbot added, \\"Many posts dispensed adult wisdom, but in a reassuringly modern way.\\" However, Craig Rubens of GigaOM, gave a more critical review of the video blog, comparing it negatively to the show with zefrank. While Rubens stated that, \\"none carry Ze‚Äôs torch with more earnestness than the brothers Green,\\" he closed by saying the Greens' vlog \\"remains a nerdy knockoff of Ze‚Äôs seminal work.\\"  References = Citations  Sources             * * External links * * Project for Awesome YouTube * Nerdfighter Community Website/Forum Category:2007 web series debuts Category:Creative Commons-licensed works Category:Green brothers Category:Video blogs Category:YouTube channels launched in 2007 Category:Nerd culture Category:Mass media in Missoula, Montana Category:Mass media in Indianapolis Category:Vlogs-related YouTube channels ","title":"Vlogbrothers"},{"id":"25885554","text":"The Kepler Input Catalog (or KIC) is a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program (SCP) and Kepler. Overview The Kepler SCP targets were observed by the 2MASS project as well as Sloan filters, such as the griz filters. The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets, because only a portion (about 1/3 of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft. The full catalog includes up to 21 magnitude, giving 13.2 million targets, but of these only about 6.5 to 4.5 million fall on Kepler's sensors. KIC is one of the few comprehensive star catalogs for a spacecraft's field of view. The KIC was created because no catalog of sufficient depth and information existed for target selection at that time. The catalog includes \\"mass, radius, effective temperature, log (g), metallicity, and reddening extinction\\". An example of a KIC catalog entry is \`KIC #10227020\`. Having had transit signals detected for this star, it has become a Kepler Object of Interest, with the designation KOI-730. Not all star Kepler Input Catalog stars with confirmed planets get a Kepler Object of Interest designation. The reason is that sometimes transit signals are detected by observations not made by Kepler team. An example of one of these objects is Kepler-78b. The unusual light curve of KIC 8462852 (also designated TYC 3162-665-1 and 2MASS J20061546+4427248), which was flagged by Planet Hunters, has engendered speculation that an alien civilization's Dyson sphere is responsible.

Known as Silver Hill Road, the highway runs from MD 5 in Silver Hill north to Walker Mill Road in District Heights. MD 458 is a four- to six-lane divided highway that connects the inner suburbs of Hillcrest Heights, Silver Hill, Suitland, and District Heights in western Prince George's County. The highway also connects those communities with the Suitland station of the Washington Metro. MD 458 was originally constructed in the early 1930s between the original alignments of MD 5 and MD 4. The route was relocated in District Heights in 1960 and widened to a divided highway in the mid-1960s. MD 458 was extended to its present southern and northern termini in the late 1960s and mid-1980s, respectively. Route description View south from the north end of MD 458 at Walker Mill Road in District Heights MD 458 begins at an intersection with MD 5 (Branch Avenue) in Silver Hill. The west leg of the intersection is Iverson Street, which passes under The Shops at Iverson and through Hillcrest Heights. MD 458 heads east as a four-lane divided highway and intersects MD 414, which heads south as St. Barnabas Road and north as Old Silver Hill Road. The highway expands to six lanes east of MD 414 and passes a Smithsonian Institution Libraries support center. MD 458 enters Suitland at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the Suitland Parkway. Just beyond the parkway, the highway passes the Suitland station on the Washington Metro's Green Line. MD 458 continues past the Suitland Federal Center, whose main tenant is the U.S. Census Bureau, and intersects Suitland Road, which heads northwest as MD 218 in the center of Suitland. The highway passes Suitland High School before its intersection with MD 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue). Just east of MD 4, unsigned MD 972 splits east along Old Silver Hill Road toward the center of District Heights. MD 458 passes along the edge of the town and intersects Marlboro Pike before reaching its northern terminus at Walker Mill Road. The intersection is a T-intersection with Walker Mill Road turning from southeast to northeast at the junction; this portion of Walker Mill Road is unsigned MD 458A. MD 458 a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector from MD 5 in Silver Hill to MD 4 in Suitland. The remainder of the route from MD 4 east to Walker Mill Road is a National Highway System principal arterial. History MD 458 was constructed as a concrete road in two sections--from MD 5 (now MD 414) in Silver Hill to MD 218 in Suitland, and from MD 218 to MD 4 (now Marlboro Pike) in District Heights-- between 1930 and 1933. The whole highway was widened with the addition of a pair of bituminous shoulders between 1940 and 1942. MD 458's interchange with the Suitland Parkway was built in its modern configuration when the parkway was constructed through Suitland in 1943. The first divided highway portion of MD 458 was created in 1960 when the highway was relocated from just south of the just-completed present alignment of MD 4 north to the old alignment of MD 4 in District Heights. Marlboro Pike became MD 4 Business, which was removed in 1970; Old Silver Hill Road became MD 972A. The divided highway was extended west from MD 4 to MD 414 in 1965. MD 458 was constructed as a divided highway to its present terminus at MD 5 in 1967; Old Silver Hill Road became an extension of MD 414. The highway was constructed as a divided highway from Marlboro Pike north to its present terminus with Walker Mill Road in 1985.

Unlike other boilers, its external drum is mounted transversely across the vehicle. The obvious advantage of the transverse boiler is that it is short lengthways, compared to a locomotive boiler. Where space is short, such as with railmotors, this can give more usable space inside. A less obvious, but more significant advantage for road vehicles, is that the water level of the boiler is less sensitive to the road gradient. When descending steep hills, there is less risk of the firebox crown being exposed above the water level and dangerously overheating. Transverse boilers are broadly similar to locomotive boilers in construction. They have an internal firebox with multiple small fire-tubes.  Yorkshire Patent steam wagons  alt=Transverse section through the boiler, showing the central firebox, tubes outwards and return tubes back to the smokebox. The best known transverse boiler was that used by the Yorkshire Patent Steam Wagon Co. for its distinctive steam wagons. This boiler, the company's eponymous patent, was unique in being both transverse and double-ended. This patent was applied for in 1900 and the boiler continued in production until 1937. It was designed to provide a compact boiler with ample heating surface and pre-dated other effective designs of vertical boiler, such as the Sentinel. The boiler consists of one long horizontal transverse drum, with a central locomotive-style firebox mounted in an extension beneath. The first boilers had a square firebox, but this was later changed to a circular section. Firing with coke is carried out through a firedoor in the side of the shell, to the rear of the boiler when installed. Fire-tubes lead to a shallow smokebox at each side, from which return tubes pass to a central chamber beneath the chimney. The chimney is wrapped with an extension of the boiler shell, acting as a steam collecting dome. There are 32 tubes in total from the firebox, of 1¬æ inch diameter, and 28 more to the chimney chamber. Longitudinal stays support the flat tubeplates at each side. An unusual feature is that rather than the usual single blastpipe beneath the chimney, there are 14 of them on each side inside each smokebox, pointing into the return tubes. Exhaust steam from the engine reaches these blastpipes through a prominent copper pipe on the outside of each smokebox door. The working pressure was 200 lb. sq. in., comparable to the more advanced locomotives of the period. An advantageous feature of the boiler was that the fire-tubes were entirely submerged. Competing vertical boilers of the period had semi-submerged tubes with their upper ends in the steam space above the water level, leading to erosion and rapid tube wear around the level. Railmotors alt=Steam railmotor, a passenger coach combined with a small locomotive. The smokebox door is prominent in the side of the locomotive. Some rare steam railmotors used transverse boilers, instead of the more common vertical boilers, or short locomotive boilers. These were chosen to provide a compact boiler, but with easier servicing than for a vertical boiler.

Design and development leftIn 1923, the Pegna-Bonmartini workshops at Sestri Ponente in Genoa, Italy, were constructing a fighter aircraft prototype designed by Ing Giovanni Pegna around the smallest airframe that could accommodate the 224-kilowatt (300-horsepower) Hispano-Suiza HS 42 eight-cylinder water-cooled engine. After the Piaggio company purchased Pegna-Bonmartini that year, construction of the prototype continued and resulted later in 1923 in the completion of the Piaggio P.2.Green and Swanborough, p. 471.

Operational history Piaggio built two P.2 prototypes and entered the P.2 in the 1923 Italian official fighter contest. The P.2 was probably ahead of its time, however the Italian Air Ministry distrusted monoplanes at the time and the P.2s performance did not meet the level that Pegna had predicted, and for these reasons no production order followed.

Bitterwater is located at . Bitterwater Valley, located at the base of the Diablo Range mountains on a crucial earthquake, San Andreas Fault, was once the primary habitat of the giant California condors. Around 1946, DDT poison was introduced throughout that area to kill coyotes, prairie dogs, mountain lions, and other animals that ate crops or posed a threat to ranch or farm animals. As the condors ate the animals killed by DDT, they too vanished. Note that this is not the problem with DDT. DDT has a relatively low toxicity to animals is not used for that purpose. The preferred agent is strychnine and it is used in grains to poison ground squirrels or meat to poison predators which leads to its consumption by birds which are then consumed by carnivores and in turn consumed by birds of prey along with the poisoned squirrels. The reason DDT is insidious to birds is it affects their ability to metabolize calcium resulting in fragile eggs which seldom hatch. DDT makes it into the food change the same way as strychnine in that the insects and fish that are killed by it end up being consumed by any animal scavenging for food. But as humans decimated the California Condor, they realized this and changed tactics. Now the Bitterwater Valley in California is home to many condors. No prairie dogs exist in Bitterwater but the digger squirrel is very pervasive in the area, as well as coyote, California badger, redtail hawks, and wild turkey. Bitterwater valley was discovered by Edward Calhoun Tully during a sheep drive from Chihuahua Mexico to San Francisco California in the mid to late 1800s.

It was the fifth and final time the Silicon Valley Football Classic was played and the final game of the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football season for both teams. Northern Illinois defeated Troy 34-21. Background For the 2004 bowl season the Silicon Valley Classic had contractual tie-ins with the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10); neither conference had enough bowl-eligible teams. In previous years the SVC had an agreement to take the Pac-10's No. 6 team, but was displaced by the new Emerald Bowl and had to settle for No. 7, if one existed. Organizers obtained permission from the Pac-10 to look elsewhere, and on November 16 announced an agreement with the Mid-American Conference, which had five bowl-eligible teams but as yet only two bowls. Since the beginning of the bowl in 2000, the Fresno State Bulldogs represented the WAC. Although the SVC invited Fresno State back, the Bulldogs opted for the MPC Computers Bowl, where they would face #18-ranked Virginia from the ACC. Left without a WAC team, organizers turned to the Troy Trojans of the Sun Belt Conference. Troy had never played in a bowl game before, having just moved up to Division I in 2001 and joined the Sun Belt in 2004.

He is a sarcastic, underachieving government official for the city of Pawnee who‚Äîin his own mind‚Äîis revered for his high levels of confidence and unmatched entrepreneurial skills. Background Thomas Montgomery Haverford is an Indian American, who changed his name from Darwish Sabir Ismael Ghani to be more appealing in politics. He is often assumed to be an immigrant by much of the Parks and Recreation staff (Leslie often assuming him to be Libyan), though, as he frequently reminds them, he hails from South Carolina, as does Ansari (although he does not have a Southern accent). He initially shared an office with Leslie Knope and worked as her immediate subordinate at the Pawnee parks and recreation department, often serving as her right-hand man. Tom displays an extremely sarcastic, mischievous and cocky attitude, and frequently attempts to secure favors from local contractors. Tom has demonstrated his talent and passion for entrepreneurship in many occasions, including Entertainment 720, Rent-A-Swag, and Tom's Bistro. He takes his appearance very seriously, often donning office-casual polo shirts, as well as fitted suits with boat shoes. He also buys clothing from the boys' collection at Brooks Brothers (\\"Telethon\\"). In \\"Go Big or Go Home,\\" Tom also boasted about ladies' sneakers he bought from his workplace during Pawnee's government shutdown. Though it is not explicitly said, it's assumed Tom worked at Lady Foot Locker, where his best friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein has a job too (\\"Woman of the Year\\"). He later opens up his own luxurious clothing-rental store for growing teens, Rent-A-Swag, and employs Jean-Ralphio's sister Mona Lisa Saperstein. Tom married his Canadian-born college friend Wendy to secure her U.S. citizenship (a green card marriage). Despite the marriage, Tom aggressively flirts with other women, which has prompted confusion from people unfamiliar with his arrangement with Wendy. He is constantly pursuing women even during his marriage, as far as going to strip clubs, hitting on Ann Perkins, distributing copies of his house keys to beautiful women, and judging at the Miss Pawnee pageant. Tom has complete authority over the Pawnee tennis court reservation system, which has brought him into close contact with many attractive female tennis enthusiasts. Tom's heroes include Tiger Woods, Vin Diesel, Michael Bolton, Flo Rida, Patrick Jane, Paul Walker, and Jamie Foxx. He has a very high image of himself and brags that people view him as a \\"Brown Superman with a Beard\\" and has also asked to be introduced as \\"The Brown Gosling\\". He is very appreciative of pop culture and the idea of 'swag', very often expressed in his vernacular (e.g. saying \\"'Serts\\" instead of \\"desserts\\" in the episode \\"Soulmates\\"). Tom often teams with April Ludgate and sometimes Donna Meagle to prank and harass Gerry Gergich. He also finds Ben Wyatt an easy target of tease. Storyline=Season one Tom appears lackadaisical about his work at the parks department and regularly undermines Leslie. He plays online Scrabble against his superior, Ron Swanson, during work time and loses on purpose in order to further his career. Ron, who believes in as little government interference as possible, approvingly states of Tom, \\"He doesn‚Äôt do a lot of work around here. He shows zero initiative. He‚Äôs not a team player. He never wants to go that extra mile. Tom is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for in a government employee.\\" Tom is often chosen to go on field projects with Leslie. He is also known for abusing his small amount of public power for self-benefit. Tom studies the culture of pickup artists and engages in a practice he calls \\"peacocking,\\" which involves finding a visual element that makes him stand out in public like a peacock. In one such date, he wears a woman's orange hat, which others find ridiculous. Season two Ron discovers Tom's green card marriage with Wendy, but agrees to keep it secret, especially after Tom discovers Ron secretly moonlights as a nightclub jazz musician. Tom and Wendy get a divorce shortly after she gets her citizenship. Although he initially appears fine, Tom realizes he did in fact harbor feelings for Wendy and regrets the parting. At the end of Season 2, Tom meets Lucy, a bartender at the Snake Hole Lounge. As of the finale, the two are dating. Season three At the beginning of Season 3, Tom is seen working at an apparel store as a sales associate while the government is on furlough. Lucy eventually breaks up with him, and reveals that their relationship ended because Tom spent too much time talking about his ex-wife's relationship with Ron Swanson. As an attempt to exact revenge on Ron, Tom brings Ron's ex-wife Tammy as a date to an event organized by the Parks department. The night ends in chaos with Ron and Tammy being arrested and getting married. It is later revealed in the episode \\"Indianapolis\\" that Tom has created his own cologne scent called \\"Tommy Fresh\\". In the season finale, Tom quits his job at the Parks Department to work at Entertainment 720 with Jean-Ralphio. Season four Tom begins working at Entertainment 720 and offers the shoeshinist at city hall, Andy Dwyer, a job, which Andy turns down. Entertainment 720 goes bankrupt due to their massive overspending and no business model and Tom decides to throw one last party which Lucy attends at which he confesses to her that he is broke and jobless. Ron tries to persuade Tom to take his old job back, departing from Tom's early storyline by saying he does his job well and keeps the bosses off Ron's back, but doesn't overachieve to the point where the Parks department is tasked to do extra assignments. Tom initially refuses but eventually agrees. After his joking style made Ann Perkins smile at a Valentine's Day party, she decides to meet him for a date which his antics immediately made her regret. However, after several fits and starts, Tom has convinced Ann to keep seeing him, even though he's oblivious to (or ignoring) her disgust at allowing herself to do so. Season five Tom finally begins what appears to be a reputable business, based on an idea he came up with during a fundraiser for Jerry in \\"Halloween Surprise\\". The idea, aptly titled \\"Rent-a-Swag\\" is to rent his own high-end clothing to middle school boys whose mothers don't want to constantly buy them new articles of clothing through puberty that they will grow out of quickly. While building this business, Tom finally learns how to responsibly make use of his money. Season six Tom learns that Jean-Ralphio's dad, Dr. Saperstein, is his business competitor, and struggles to keep Rent-a-Swag afloat, before finally giving in and selling Rent-a-Swag. He tries to focus on his job, helping Leslie get fluoride added to the water in Pawnee, and helping to set up the unity concert. While assisting Nadia Stasky, a beautiful and humorous doctor, at the Parks and Recreation office, Tom attempts to woo her and she later agrees to go out with him. The two pursue a relationship, and before leaving on a business trip to Rwanda, Nadia agrees to call him when she returns. During a meeting, Tom meets a man who likes his ideas and helps him jump-start his idea for a restaurant, Tom's Bistro. Season seven Now in 2017, Tom's Bistro has become very successful. After reuniting with his ex-girlfriend Lucy, he convinces her to move from Chicago to Pawnee and work at the Bistro. Shortly thereafter, they begin dating and he eventually proposes to her, which she accepts. In a series of flash-forwards in the finale, it is shown that Tom loses a great amount of money after unsuccessfully attempting to franchise Tom's Bistro. However, he later becomes a success again by writing a book about his many failures and how others may be able to achieve success. Critical reception Aziz Ansari, who was particularly acclaimed during the first season for his role as Tom Haverford, received similar praise in the second season as well. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star- Ledger, described Tom as the funniest of the characters during the first season, and Jonah Weiner of Slate.com, who was critical of the first season, said Tom was \\"the brightest spot.\\" Paste ranked him No. 10 in their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011.

Kolodny is an author and specialist in human sexuality and related topics. Early life and career Born in New York City as the eldest child of Maxwell H. Kolodny, M.D., Ph.D., and Selma B. Kolodny, he attended Edgemont High School in Scarsdale, New York, and Columbia University (B.A., 1965), where he studied with Moses Hadas and Susan Sontag, with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. He then went on to Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (M.D., 1969), where he co-founded the school's first course on medical ethics in 1969 and studied with noted child psychiatrist E. James Anthony, who had trained under Piaget and Anna Freud. Dr. Kolodny did his internship and residency at Harvard University (at what is now the Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital) and a fellowship in Endocrinology and Metabolism at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. As the first medical student to study with William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson at what was then called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation in St. Louis in 1968‚Äì69 (subsequently renamed the Masters & Johnson Institute in December 1978), Kolodny returned to this research institution after his training in 1972 and eventually became Associate Director, Director of Training and Head of the Endocrine Research Section of the Masters & Johnson Institute. His research focused primarily on the effects of drugs (both illicit and prescription) on sexual function, the effects of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, and hypertension on sexual well-being, and studies of process and outcome of sex therapy, as well as topics in infertility. With his colleague Joan Bauman, Ph.D., Kolodny also conducted research seeking to identify the biochemical components (short chain aliphatic fatty acids) in human vaginal secretions that serve as pheromones in other mammalian species Bauman, J.E., Kolodny, R.C., and Webster, S.K., \\"Vaginal organic acids and hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle\\", Fertility and Sterility 38: 572-579, 1982.' Dr. Kolodny is currently Medical Director and Chairman of the Board of the Behavioral Medicine Institute in New Canaan, Connecticut. He has served as a member of the Board of Advocates of Planned Parenthood for more than a quarter century. In 1983, he received the prestigious National Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in recognition of his distinguished career. He has been a visiting professor or guest lecturer at institutions such as The Smithsonian, the National Institutes of Health, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, and has conducted postgraduate medical education programs for tens of thousands of physicians and other health care professionals. Dr. Kolodny has been a featured guest on hundreds of national television shows, from Good Morning America and the David Susskind Show to Larry King Live, Nightline, Crossfire, and the MacNeil-Lehrer Report. In 1997, he joined the board of directors of Advanced Viral Research Corporation, a biotechnology company specializing in peptide nucleic acids.

She was executed outside Dorchester Prison after being convicted of the murder of her second husband, John Brown, on 5 July, just 45 days earlier. The prosecution said she had attacked him with an axe after he had taken a whip to her.Morrison 2008. Background Among the crowd of 3,000-4,000 who watched the hanging of Brown was the English novelist, Thomas Hardy, 16 years old at the time, standing close to the gallows. He wrote 70 years later that he was ashamed to have been there. Brown was dressed in a long, black, silk dress. A cloth was placed over her head, but as it began to rain, her face became visible again. Hardy wrote, \\"I saw‚Äîthey had put a cloth over the face‚Äîhow, as the cloth got wet, her features came through it. That was extraordinary.\\"Millgate 2006, pp. 62-63. \\"I remember what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain,\\" he wrote elsewhere, \\"and how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half-round and back.\\" Blake Morrison writes that the hanging of Tess in Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) reflected his experience of watching Brown's death. He also revealed that it gave him a kink that encouraged him to put a wet flour sack over his wife's head when he made love to her. A local newspaper recorded that she was counselled just before her death by the Rev. D Clementson, the prison chaplain, and that she remained composed: > This morning (Saturday) a few minutes after 8 o'clock, Elizabeth Martha > BROWN, convicted of the wilful murder of her husband was executed on a > scaffold erected over the gateway of the new entrance leading to Dorset > County Goal from North Square.

The date appears to be an error; the entry > says \\"this morning (Saturday),\\" but 11 August that year was a Monday. A Dorset-based company, Angel Exit Theatre, produced a play called The Ballad of Martha Brown based on the life and times of Martha Brown. The play premiered at Deverills Festival in Wiltshire on 3 May 2014 and continued on a tour of the South West and South East. In September - October 2015 it again toured the UK. In 1995, Australian band The Lucksmiths released the track \\"Thomas & Martha\\" based on Thomas Hardy's recollections of the event. In 2016, it was reported that remains unearthed at the site of Dorchester prison in Dorset may belong to Brown. In 2018 it was reported that Martha may be re- buried with others in the Poundbury Cemetery, should she not be buried in the churchyard at Blackdown, where her husband's remains lie.

It had 489 inhabitants in the 2008 census. It's well known for its wine industry. History After the Reapers' War Raimat remained an uninhabited place, with only the ruins of a medieval castle of Arabic origin standing, until in 1914 the landowner Manuel Ravent√≥s acquired in the area, including the castle, and turned them into what nowadays is still the biggest vine culture in the hands of a single owner in the whole of Europe.

It was commissioned by Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, the widow of Samuel Colt and completed in 1867. The church and its associated parish house were designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter, and serve as a memorial to Samuel Colt and members of his family. The church and parish house were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and became a contributing property to the Coltsville Historic District in 2008. Description and history The Church of the Good Shepherd is located in Hartford's Coltsville area south of the downtown, on the southeast side of Wyllys Street just south of its junction with Charter Oak Avenue. It is a masonry structure, built out of Portland brownstone and Ohio sandstone. It is roughly T shaped and has Gothic Revival styling. It has a steeply pitched polychrome slate roof, with parapeted gable ends that have crosses at the peaks. A square tower with buttresses rises at one of the crooks of the T, with a low crenellated battlement below the octagonal spire. The interior features a variety of stone types in the construction of the floors and columns, and has heavy chestnut timbers in the roof framing. The southwest entrance arch is carved with examples of the workers' tools used in the Samuel Colt's factory. The church was commissioned in 1866 by Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, and serves as a memorial to her husband Samuel, who died in 1862, and two of their infant children. The parish house was built in 1895, also to a design by Potter, as a memorial to Colt's son Caldwell Hart Colt who died in 1894. Potter had come out of retirement to design this building. It continues the Gothic architectural detailing found on the church, but is more symmetrical in its massing.

Built in the 1820s to a design by Ithiel Town, it is one of the earliest known examples of Gothic Revival architecture in the United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.Contributions to the history of Christ church, Hartford, Volume 1 (Belknap & Warfield, 1895) It is the cathedral church of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut, whose offices are next door at 45 Church Street. Architecture and history Christ Church Cathedral stands in downtown Hartford at the southwest corner of Church and Main Streets, surrounded by large-scale commercial buildings. It is a basically rectangular brownstone structure, with a square tower centered at its eastern end. The main facade is divided into three sections by the tower, each of which has a doorway set in a two-story Gothic-arched recess, with a window above. The sides are five bays deep, with buttresses separating Gothic-arched windows, and brownstone finials at intervals along the roof line. The finial details are repeated at the top of the tower, which is surrounded by a low balustrade. Anglican services have been held in Connecticut since 1702. The Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut was organized in 1785 by Samuel Seabury. This church was designed by New Haven architect Ithiel Town, who designed that city's Trinity Church. Primary construction of the edifice lasted from 1827 to 1829, with the tower (designed by Nathaniel Sheldon Wheaton, after traveling to see country churches in England) not completed until 1939. These two Town designs are the oldest known examples of Gothic Revival architecture in the United States. Later additions to the building include alterations designed by Henry Austin, George Keller, Frederick Withers, and Ralph Adams Cram. These were typically done with great care to enhance or complement Town's original design.

Oren, Joining the Club: A History of Jews and Yale, second edition. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001. The society's Friday night meetings, discussion- based format and ethos of mutual improvement have drawn comparisons to Benjamin Franklin's Junto Club. As one journalist described it, \\"like Yale's famous secret societies, Shabtai is elite and exclusive, but unlike the infamous Skull & Bones or Scroll & Key or Book & Snake, it is not clandestine.\\" Another described it as facilitating \\"the kind of conversations around the Shabbat table that bring together secular and sectarian, poor and rich, Muslim and Jew, student and scholar, Mormon and pagan and jock and genius.\\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865689648/A-Jew-a-Mormon-a-Muslim- and-a-pagan-learn-to-be-agreeable-by-disagreeing-at-dinner.html In 2014, a gift by Benny Shabtai and family facilitated the purchase of the Anderson Mansion, a late-nineteenth century mansion in New Haven's Orange Street Historic District.  Yale 300  In celebration of Yale's tercentennial in 2001, the society recorded interviews with 300 prominent Jewish alumni of Yale from various disciplines and walks of life, including Stephen A.

The screening was attended by New Haven Mayor Toni Harp. In 2012, the society hosted Israel soldier Gilad Shalit in an event celebrating his release from five years of Hamas captivity the year before. Hundreds of students attended and were addressed by Prof. Charles Hill and dignitaries from the government of Israel.https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/10/16/israeli-soldier-visits- campus/ The society hosted Tony Schwartz, ghostwriter of The Art of the Deal, in 2017 to discuss Donald Trump's psychology, motivations, and character, as observed from shadowing him to write the book. In November 2018, Shabtai hosted criminal justice reform advocate Anthony Ray Hinton at a Yud Tes Kislev event commemorating the anniversary of the release of Shneur Zalman of Liadi from imprisonment by the tsarist Russian police. Hinton discussed the 30 years he spent on death row in Alabama before being freed by forensic evidence that his court-appointed lawyer had failed to request. In December 2018, Shabtai hosted attorney Kristen Feden to discuss her prosecution of Bill Cosby on charges of rape. Feden said that the success of the prosecution proved that, increasingly \\"victims of rape and sexual assault can find justice in our legal institutions, as well as society.\\"  Business ethics and leadership and philanthropy  Corporate leaders lecture regularly at Shabtai in an effort to inspire morals ethics and values in the financial world.

She is a nurse and Leslie Knope's best friend. Storyline=Season 1  At the start of the series, Ann Perkins is living with her boyfriend Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt). Ann is far more mature and responsible than Andy, who remains lazy, spoiled, and unemployed. After Andy falls into a large pit next to her house and breaks his legs, Ann is inspired to attend Parks and Recreation meetings to advocate for filling in the pit, which leads Ann to befriend the department's deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). Eventually, after Andy's leg casts are removed, Ann learns he could have taken them off weeks prior, but did not because he enjoyed being pampered and spoiled by Ann. This leads to an angry confrontation, and eventually the two break up, much to Andy's despair. Season 2  After Andy, Pawnee city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) fell into the construction pit (at the end of season one) and is nursed by Ann during his time at the hospital. The two develop a romantic interest in each other and start dating only after Leslie, who previously harbored feelings for Mark, assures Ann she is fine with the pairing. At first, Ann seems to be happy with Mark, but as time goes on, she starts getting bored having a normal and healthy relationship, remembering that her relationship with Andy, while terrible, was more interesting. Furthermore, she shows a hint of jealousy toward Andy's budding relationship with Parks Department intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza). However, she continues to date Mark, unsure of what her true feelings are for him. Yet, when Mark attempts to propose to her, she realises that she has fallen out of love with him, and that she really wants to be with Andy. She and Mark break up, and Mark leaves his government job to work in the private sector. In the season finale episode, after Andy crashes his motorcycle, Ann kisses him while nursing him at the hospital. On another night, she gets drunk and kisses state auditor Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), which prompts him to continually ask her out on a date, which she declines because she is put off by his relentless positivity. Season 3  Chris continues to ask Ann out, but she repeatedly turns him down. Leslie sees an opportunity to utilize Chris' positivity to bring more funds into the Parks Department by having Ann bring it up on a date. While out, Ann learns of the reason for Chris' positivity: he was born with a rare blood disorder and was expected to die as a baby, and so he is happy to still be alive many years later; as a result, she takes a genuine liking to him. Their date is ruined when both Leslie and state auditor Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) crash it, and Leslie accidentally reveals the motive behind the date. Ann later apologizes to Chris and asks him out on another date, and the two soon enter into a relationship. Initially, Ann is intimidated by Chris' intensity, calling him \\"the perfect human man\\". But after he is incapacitated by a serious flu virus and so drops his appearance of perfection, Ann relaxes. After a few weeks of dating, Ann is infatuated enough with Chris to have no issues with the idea of leaving Pawnee and following him to Indianapolis. When the two discuss the issue of a long distance relationship or the notion of Ann's moving with him, Ann believes that things are a bit cleared up although she came up with no definite solution on the issue. Ann later tells Leslie Chris became distant after their \\"talk\\", which prompts Leslie to search his house for items that could suggest his infidelity, when she and Ron visit his house in Indianapolis. There, she finds a pink razor and pink swim cap, and calls Ann about it. Ann then storms into Chris' house, accusing him of cheating on her, only to find out that he had actually broken up with her in their conversation the week before; Ann did not realize he had dumped her, because Chris was so cheerful about it. (The razor and swim cap both actually belonged to Chris.) Ann is emotionally affected by the break up, and she begins engaging in impulsive behaviors, such as dyeing part of her hair red and making out with a patient during the Harvest Festival. When Chris returns to Pawnee as the temporary city manager, the two of them discuss their relationship over dinner, where Ann is fooled again by his positive attitude into thinking their relationship is back on. In order to cope, she decides to start dating again, which causes her to be more distant from Leslie. Leslie, in response, recommends her as the new Health Department public relations director. Ann ends up taking the job part-time so she can still be a nurse at the hospital. Season 4  In season four, Ann moves on from Chris after they shoot a PSA. Ann gets closer to Ron and April after she tells them a disgusting medical story. This results from several failed attempts to engage in small talk, over fact-checking Leslie's book. Ann is again a big supporter in Leslie and Ben getting back together. She also agrees to help Leslie with her campaign and temporarily became her campaign manager. In \\"Operation Ann\\", Leslie tries to help Ann meet a date. She ends up going out with Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), even though almost everything he does annoys her and they frequently break up. On election night, a drunken Ann agrees to move in with Tom. Season 5  In season five, Ann and Tom have moved in together. Despite realizing, within two days, that it was a mistake, they stay together to thwart their co-workers' expectations that it wouldn't last, and so Tom won't lose his $1,000 bet with Donna Meagle (Retta). They publicly break up when Donna tells them she knows the truth and lets Tom off the hook. Ann decides she wants to have a child and begins the process of in vitro fertilization, asking Chris to father her child. Chris accepts her offer in the episode \\"Bailout\\". Ann and April's friendship expands this season, culminating in a hug and an admission on April's part that she considers Ann a friend. Season 6  In the season six premiere, Ann reveals that she is back together with Chris, and she is pregnant. In the episode \\"New Beginnings\\", Chris and Ann briefly get engaged but decide that they don't need to be married since they're both happy with their relationship. They also learn they are having a boy. Chris and Ann decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, as Chris is offered a job at the University of Michigan coupled with their desire to be closer to Ann's family, who reside in Michigan. Upon hearing the news, Leslie decides to throw Ann a goodbye party and start groundbreaking on \\"Pawnee Commons\\", the lot that was a pit at the start of the series, which Leslie vowed to turn into a park. On Ann and Chris' final day in Pawnee, Ann tells Leslie she will always be her best friend and invites her to come and visit, then she and Chris leave Pawnee until moving back in the final episode of season 7. On \\"Galentine's Day\\", Ann hangs up on Leslie from their scheduled phone call. Leslie later finds out that Ann did this because she was in labor and didn't want Leslie to drop everything to come see her because she could be in labor for hours. Ann is later visited by Leslie at the hospital, and she is seen holding her newborn son Oliver Perkins-Traeger. Chris is not featured in the episode because he was asked to be the birthing coach for another patient, since he did such a great job with Ann. Season 7 Ann and Chris, now married, return for a guest appearance in the series finale in order to advise Leslie in 2025. It is revealed that after Oliver, the couple had a second child, a daughter named Leslie. Development While in early stages of developing Parks and Recreation, Greg Daniels and Michael Schur had been considering ideas for a possible show involving Rashida Jones before the concept of the series was even established. Both Daniels and Schur had worked with Jones on the Daniels-created NBC comedy series, The Office, in which Jones played the character Karen Filippelli. It was only after Amy Poehler was cast as protagonist Leslie Knope that the concept of the show and Ann's character were fully developed. While most of the Parks and Recreation character work for the local Pawnee government, Ann Perkins was initially conceived as a political outsider who became indirectly involved in municipal government and, in Schur's words, \\"got drawn into Leslie's world\\". Ann Perkins appeared in every episode of Parks and Recreation until Season 6, except for \\"Woman of the Year\\", which she missed because she was filming scenes for the David Fincher film The Social Network (2010). Her last name was inspired by Nancy Perkins, one of the casting directors who worked on the show. In crafting the Ann Perkins character, the staff were drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Ann and Leslie Knope's. Reception While most reviewers have praised Rashida Jones' performance, the character of Ann Perkins initially received mixed reviews from critics. Ann often serves as a straight man to the other characters, particularly Leslie Knope, and some reviewers have said Rashida Jones' talent has been under-utilized in the role. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"While I like Rashida Jones in the part, her character usually does best when she's got some wacky person to play off of.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said, \\"Even Parks and Rec lovers often agree that Rashida Jones‚Äôs character can seem, well, kind of boring.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN wrote, \\"Ann isn't necessarily the funniest character on the show, to say the least\\", but he said she is capable of being very humorous, adding: \\"Rashida Jones is sexy and funny, but a lot of her humor is subtle and thankless.\\" New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said he did not believe the Ann character was necessary for the show because she was too far removed from the other characters. He added, \\"The Parks and Recreation writers are the smartest in the business, and even they seem at a loss as to what to do with Ann Perkins.\\" However, Los Angeles Times reporter Robert Lloyd said he felt Jones and Amy Poehler had a good comedic rhythm with each other, and The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said Jones has a \\"natural comic sensibility\\" who rarely gets the best material due to her straight man role. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall said Jones not only plays a good straight man, but particularly excels in bringing the best comedic potential out of her fellow cast members. The character was listed in Wetpaint's \\"10 Hottest TV Nurses\\". Many reviewers were critical of the pairing of Mark and Ann, feeling the couple lacked chemistry and were often the least funny parts of the individual episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons called Mark and Ann the show's \\"Achilles' heel\\", and Sandra Gonzalez, also from Entertainment Weekly, wrote, \\"No matter what they do with these two, I can‚Äôt help but be bored.\\" Alan Sepinwall said the relationship was ineffective because both Mark and Ann are \\"straight man\\" characters, and he called the pairing one of the few mistakes of the second season. In his review of \\"94 Meetings\\", in which Mark discusses his intentions to marry Ann, Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club wrote of the couple, \\"their scenes just seemed to lay there and die: action was set up but never resolved, and the deferral contained no laughs to compensate for the dramatic fizzle\\". Matt Fowler of IGN called the pairing one of the \\"lesser elements\\" of the second season, but said it had more to do with Mark than Ann: \\"Mark just wound up feeling extraneous, [but] I can also appreciate the nuanced realism of Ann just realizing that she wasn't ultimately that 'into him' as a way to break them up.\\" Ann would receive much more positive reviews in the later seasons. Many reviewers claimed Ann's relationship with Chris in the third season was a major improvement, with several writing that Chris' near-perfection took the normally composed Ann out of her comfort zone, giving Rashida Jones more comedic material to work with. Several commentators felt Ann's character in general saw major improvements during the third season, such as in subplots where she started acting eccentrically after her break-up with Chris, or her phase of dating several random men. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that by the middle of the third season, \\"Ann's character defies all the expectations heaped on her from two previous seasons\\". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com wrote: \\"Rashida Jones hasn't been given too much opportunity to shine within the ensemble, so pushing her off the deep-end seems to be a good decision. Jones is a really funny actress if given the right material, and it's quickly becoming apparent that the 'crazy, almost slutty' approach is one that works in a comedic way for her very, very well.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN wrote, \\"While Ann still isn't the best of the bunch as far as characters go, she was able to be a part of more great scenes this year by getting paired up with Chris in the first half of the season and getting to have some great moments of drunken anger in 'The Fight'.\\" Several reviews also praised the pairing of Ann and Donna Meagle, who gives her dating advice in the episode \\"Harvest Festival\\" and \\"April and Andy's Fancy Party\\".

It is the oldest church congregation in Hartford, founded in 1636 by Thomas Hooker. The present building, the congregation's fourth, was built in 1807, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The adjacent cemetery, formally set apart in 1640, was the city's sole cemetery until 1803. Description The First Church of Christ, located in downtown Hartford at the corner of Main and Gold Streets, is a prominent local example of Classical Revival architecture. Daniel Wadsworth probably designed it, loosely following the example of architect James Gibbs's church of Saint Martin in the Fields in London.

History The Hartford congregation was founded as a Reformed congregation in 1636 with Thomas Hooker serving as the first pastor.Historical catalogue of the First Church in Hartford. 1633-1885 (Pub. by the Church, Hartford: 1885) The members of the congregation had previously migrated from England to Massachusetts and spent four years there before leaving Massachusetts after a dispute with the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The old burial ground adjacent to the building in Hartford dates to around 1640. The current church meeting house dates to 1807 and is the fourth meeting house to serve as a place of worship for the congregation. The church meeting house and cemetery were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The congregation is currently affiliated with the United Church of Christ (UCC).

It is a single-story brick building, with a gabled roof trimmed in wood, and a concrete foundation. It is set at an angle and on a rise on its lot, giving it visual prominence over the local streetscape. The main facade consists of a monumental six-column Corinthian portico, with a full entablature and dentillated full pediment. A multi-stage tower with clock and bell stages rises to an octagonal spire. The building was designed by Davis and Brooks and built in 1913-14 for a congregation known as The Free Church and later as the Fourth Congregational Church, established in 1832. This church building notably reused the doors, steeple, and portico of the congregation's old church, an 1850 building designed by New Haven architect Sidney Mason Stone. The Bushnell congregation was formed in 1954 by the merger of the Fourth Congregational with the congregation of the Windsor Avenue Congregational Church building on Main Street.

He sought to commemorate his victory over the House of Egmond at the Battle of Linnich on 3 November, which is Saint Hubert's day. The establishment of the Order occurred during a long-term, intermittent territorial dispute, initially between the Dukes of J√ºlich and the Dukes of Guelders, who were descended from a female line of the House of J√ºlich. The dispute began in the 1430s, when Arnold, Duke of Gelderland claimed the duchy of J√ºlich and the county of Ravensberg, and was resolved in the 1614 Treaty of Xanten, which established the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg of the counties of Ravensberg and Mark with the duchies of Cleves, J√ºlich and Berg. In 1778, Charles Theodore, Duke of J√ºlich and Berg and the Count-Elector Palatine, succeeded his childless cousin, Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria and brought the Order to Bavaria. Initially, the order was open to men and women, although limiting the number of male companions to sixty. It commemorated the conversion of Saint Hubert and his standing as the patron saint of hunters and knights. Over time, the award had other uses as a reward for loyalty to the monarch and service to the princely state. History=Foundation Sources agree that the Order of Saint Hubert honors a military victory of the Duke of J√ºlich, on Saint Hubert's day, 3 November 1444.For example, see F.M. Rudge. \\"Military Orders of St. Hubert.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 January 2010 or Thomas Wilhelm. \\"Hubert, St. Order of.\\" A military dictionary and gazetteer. Philadelphia: L.R. Hamersly & Co., 1881, p. 230. Sources differ on the specific date of establishment of the Order, whether it celebrated the victory at the Battle of Linnich between Gebhard V of J√ºlich and Arnold of Egmont (or Egmond), or commemorated the battle at a future date. Consequently, the date of the founding depends on the source. Still other sources date the founding of the Order as late as 1473 or 1475.D'Arcy Jonathan Dacre Boulton. The knights of the Crown: the monarchical orders of knighthood in later medieval Europe 1325‚Äì1520. Woodbridge: Boydell, 1987, , pp. 604‚Äì605. Twentieth century investigation has helped to clear up some of the confusion. The original Latin statutes of the foundation use Good Friday, in this case 26 March 1445. Furthermore, there is clear written evidence that the Order existed prior to March 1445: The original German statutes were dated immediately after the battle. It is also possible that Gerhard proclaimed the establishment of the Order immediately after the victory of his knights at Linnich, but the documents were not drawn up until later, leading to discrepancy in the dates of 1444 or 1445. To further obfuscate the date of founding, Gerhard's son, William III, renewed the Order upon his own succession to the ducal dignities in 1475, in the so-called New Statutes, which were prepared in Latin and German. These remained the governing documents of the Order until 1708. In this confirmation probably lies the root of confusion over the date of the Order's foundation. Initially the Order was a knightly brotherhood (Rittersbruderschaft), reflecting the overlapping religious and military aspects of medieval court life. Saint Hubert was the patron saint of hunters and knights. The founding of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders. The purpose of these, whether established by monarchs or princes, was to foster loyalty to a sovereign, replacing to the old Chivalric orders developed in the Crusades. Although some historians classify the Order of the Saint Hubert as a confraternal order, during its 600-year-life, its purpose changed as the fortunes and needs of the Dukes of J√ºlich and Berg and their successors changed.Fran√ßois Velde.

Charles IV Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, wearing the collar and medallion of the guardian of the order Order under the House of J√ºlich When Reinhold IV, Duke of Gelder, died in 1423, his nephew Arnold inherited the dukedom. Arnold's cousin, Adolf of Berg, inherited territories near Li√®ge. Arnold believed that Adolf had inherited the better of the two properties, and coveted it for himself. He tried to take it by force and failed; a compromise was reached by which the two agreed to a truce. Adolf of Berg died in 1437 and his cousin, Gerhard IV, the Duke of J√ºlich and Count of Ravensburg (Westphalia), inherited both the Li√®ge properties and the Duchy of Berg. Arnold reasserted his old claim, maintaining that the truce to which he and Adolf agreed was no longer valid, and prepared to take the duchies by force. Confident in his right to the inheritance, Gerhard met Arnold in battle, at the village of Linnich, in the county of Ravensburg (Westphalia). He and his knights defeated Arnold and his knights on Saint Hubert's day in 1444. In celebration, Gerhard declared the founding of the Order, to reward his loyal and victorious knights.John Bernard Burke. Book of Orders of Knighthood and Decorations of Honour of all Nations. London: Hurst and Blackett, 1858, pp. 46‚Äì47; Boulton, pp. 604‚Äì605. The Order remained in collateral branches of the family of the Dukes of J√ºlich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, but, under the Salic law practiced in the northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband‚Äîwho was also her distant relative‚ÄîJohn III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies and the administration of the Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and M√ºnster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.Jonathan Irvine Israel, Conflicts of Empires: Spain, the Low countries and the struggle for world supremacy, 1585‚Äì1713.

Thomas Cromwell: Machiavellian statecraft and the English Reformation. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2009. , p. 172. In the subsequent succession chaos, the Order fell into disuse. By the late 17th century, the Duchy of J√ºlich passed into the jurisdiction of the Prince-Elector Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Neuberg, who descended from a cadet branch of the Palatine line of the House of Wittelsbach. In May 1708, he restored the Order of Saint Hubert and assumed the position of grand master for himself. To reward loyalty and service, he conferred the cross of the Order on several of his courtiers. He also gave the recipients generous pensions on the condition that a tenth be set aside for the poor, and a significant sum be distributed on the day of their reception into the order.Rudge, \\"Military Orders of St. Hubert.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Burke's Peerage, 2010. , p. 295. Structure and requirements Initially, hierarchy of membership was relatively flat. The statutes called for a grand master, in this case the Duke of J√ºlich,Rudge, \\"Military Orders of St. Hubert.\\" four masters, and a provost, or arms master. Of the four masters, two were required to be representative of families of the Duchies of J√ºlich or Berg; the origins of the others had no geographic limitations. The masters were the clearing house for membership; they investigated the admission of new members and any alleged infractions by the existing membership. The Provost, a weapons master, maintained the weapons and arms of the brotherhood, and himself wore a special medallion. The Order was open to men and women, and both genders were entitled companions. Until 1476, there were no limits on the number of companions to be admitted, but that year, with the new edition of the Order's statutes, the Duke limited the number of men to 60;Rudge, \\"Military Orders of Saint Hubert.\\" unlimited women could be admitted. The editions of the Order's statutes, two in Latin and two in German, established similar requirements for membership. The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth‚Äîeight generations of noble grandparents‚Äîand of unblemished reputation; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble. Women were to be spouses of a companion; in the 1476 versions of the statutes, both Latin and German, female members of the Duchess' household could be admitted even if their husbands were not members or if the women were single, but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess. The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if their husbands became companions of the order. Restructuring under Maximilian Joseph IV In confirming the Order, on 18 May 1808, the King of Bavaria declared the Order to be the first in the kingdom and linked it to the Order of Civic of Merit. He limited membership to twelve knights from the ranks of counts and barons, excluding himself, as grandmaster, and members (native and foreign), who may be nominated by the sovereign. Entrance fees were 200 gold ducats for princes. Those under the rank of prince paid an entrance fee of 100 silver ducats, which amounted to 120 Reichsthaler; the silver Reichsthaler was 29.44g of .989 fineness.M. Reichard, Itinerary of Germany, or A Traveller's Guide. London: Leigh, 1819, pp. 66-70. He also established a dress costume for festival days, which included not only the insignia of the Order, but a black collar with a sash, narrow, short breeches with poppy-colored garters and bows, a short black cape, a sword, and a plumed hat.Sourindro Mohun Tagore.

Collars, Badges and Stars An unidentified recipient of the Order of Saint Hubert, prior to 1823 The gold-enameled cross lies in a white field, and surmounted by a crown; on one side is represented the conversion of Saint Hubert, with the legend In trau vast (firm in fidelity) in Gothic letters. On the reverse, lies the imperial orb and the Latin inscription \\"In memoriam recuperat√¶ dignitatis a vit√¶ 1708\\" (\\"In remembrance of the restoration of the original dignity, 1708\\"). Originally, it consisted of a collar and a pendant jewel. The J√ºlich collar consisted of stylized horns (six for men, four for women), intertwined with a cloud-like figure eight. The jewel depicted a relief of the conversion of Saint Hubert. Its overall design alluded to the Saint as the patron of hunters, and thus the patron of knights.Boulton, p. 604. The great cross was only worn on special days; on all other days, a smaller cross must be worn, and the member was fined 20 thalers for any and each omission). The smaller cross was decorated appropriately for its size.Tagore, p. 25. The collar of the Order under the Wittelsbach dynasty consisted of forty-four gold links, twenty-two of which consisted of a rectangular representation of the conversion of Saint Hubert in open relief surrounded by a gold and white enamel frame. These alternated with twenty-two other links consisted of the intertwined initial letters of the motto In trau vast, (firm in fidelity), i.e., I, T and V in Gothic letters radiating small golden rays, each of these links being alternatively enameled red or green. From the center rectangular link hung a white enameled Maltese cross, each arm strewn with numerous small golden flames and each point of the cross was tipped with a small gold ball. Between each arm of this cross were five straight gold rays and in the center of the cross was a round medallion bearing a golden representation in relief of the conversion of Saint Hubert against a green enamel background. The reverse of this cross bore the same design with this same representation but against a red enamel background. The links from the collar of the Order The sash of the Order was poppy red moire with narrow green borders, but under the knot, at the ends of this sash, these green borders as well as the ends of the sash were covered with gold metallic ribbon. Like the sash of the Order of the Garter this sash was worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. The cross worn with this sash was a Maltese cross with narrow arms also enameled white strewn with numerous golden flames, with three straight rays between each arm, each point of the cross being tipped with a small gold ball. Between the two gold balls on the top arm of the cross was a three-dimensional gold representation of the Bavarian crown, by which the cross hung from its sash. In the center of the cross was a large round medallion consisting of a small golden representation of the conversion of Saint Hubert against a green enamel background and surrounded by a wide border in red enamel with the motto the order In trau vast in Gothic letters set with small diamonds. On the reverse, in the center of the cross was a golden representation in relief of the imperial orb and cross (i.e., the heraldic symbol of the Prince-Elector as the Arch-Steward of the Holy Roman Empire) against a red enamel background and surrounded with a white enamel scroll-like border with the inscription \\"In memoriam recuperatae dignitatis aviate. 1708\\" (\\"In remembrance of the restoration of the original dignity, 1708\\"). The star of the order, worn on the left breast, was a radiant silver star of eight points surrounding a gold, white enameled cross patt√©e strewn with golden flames and with a round poppy red enameled central medallion bearing the motto In trau vast in golden Gothic letters and surrounded by a white enameled and gold border. Two exemplars of the Order's medallion from the 19th century. The exemplar on the left is similar to the style produced in the 1840s; it is approximately in diameter, with silver balls on the tips of the star points. The center is enamel on gold.

Although not part of that cemetery's original rural cemetery design, they are a prominent work of architect George Keller, designed in 1882 and completed in 1889. The Gothic Revival structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Cedar Hill Cemetery is located in southwestern Hartford, with its boundaries extending into neighboring Newington. The cemetery was laid out in 1866 in a variant of the then- fashionable rural cemetery style. The main cemetery entrance is in Hartford, at the junction of Fairfield and Maple Avenues. The roadway is flanked by a stone gateway. The gateway consists of a two-leaf gate with columns and curved flanking walls, and is flanked by a small waiting room on the left side of the gate and an office building of similar scale to the right. The granite for these structures and the adjacent chapel was quarried in Westerly, Rhode Island. The chapel, 2018 Immediately to the left of these structures stands the Northam Memorial Chapel. It is a Gothic Revival stone structure, with a slate roof and a small bell tower. The interior of the chapel has a polychrome tile floor, cherry pews, and a series of large exposed wooden trusses supporting the roof. The chancel arch and other trim elements are red sandstone. The chapel was designed by George Keller and built in 1882, funded by gifts from the Charles Northam, a West Indies merchant, and other members of his family. This complex was built in 1889, and named in honor of Julia Gallup, wife of David Gallup, a local businessman, banker, and judge. This collection of buildings form a cohesive and complementary addition to the rural cemetery design of Jacob Weidenmann, who laid out Cedar Hill Cemetery.

He is the city planner for Pawnee, Indiana, as well as Leslie Knope's colleague and one of Ann Perkins' ex-boyfriends. He is portrayed by Paul Schneider, who left Parks and Recreation at the end of the second season; despite the producers' plans to the contrary, Schneider did not reprise the role in any later seasons, and the show made no references to the character after his departure. Background Mark Brendanawicz was a city planner of Polish descent with the Pawnee municipal government. When he studied city planning in college, Mark was optimistic about the field and dreamed of designing huge and impressive cities. However, since graduation, Mark learned most of the career largely involved mundane technical issues, such as regulating the sizes of garages and proposed construction additions to houses. As a result, Mark grew jaded and disillusioned with the career, and became critical of government processes in general. Mark has a self-absorbed personality and engages in romantic flings with multiple women without any sign of seeking a commitment. Mark and Leslie had sex on one occasion and Leslie harbored romantic feelings for the next six years, although Mark does not return the feelings, and in fact did not recollect their night together for several years afterward. In season two, he enters a committed relationship with Ann and even considers marriage before the breakup. Storyline=Season one Leslie continues to harbor a crush on Mark, but Mark is not interested in her romantically, and instead appears to be more interested in her friend Ann; an early draft of the script had Mark stating that he didn't care about Leslie or the park project but supported her efforts because it would allow him to spend more time around Ann, but this was changed to the final version where Mark is impressed by Leslie's fighting spirit and helps the park project for that reason. Mark agrees to help Leslie in her quest to turn a large construction pit into a park, but he is pragmatic about her chances of success, and warns it has little chance of succeeding. When Leslie seeks his help in dealing with newspaper reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep, who is planning to write a negative story, Mark makes the situation worse by having sex with her. This angers Leslie, particularly after Mark tells the reporter in confidence that the pit project will never be successful, only to later learn she plans to use that it in the story. One night, while feeling particularly disillusioned and unhappy with the insignificance of his career, Mark makes a halfhearted attempt to flirt with Ann, unaware of Ann's anger over problems with her boyfriend Andy. Mark's advances are quickly and harshly rejected by an irritated Ann as a result. Later that night, Mark and Leslie spend time together at the pit and an intoxicated Mark attempts to kiss her. Not wishing to reconnect with Mark in his drunken state, Leslie rejects his advances, and Mark accidentally falls into the pit and injures his legs. Season two Following the accident at the pit, Mark becomes less jaded and abandons his promiscuous lifestyle. He and Ann develop a romantic interest in each other after she nurses him back to health at the hospital while his legs healed. They start dating only after Leslie assures Ann she is fine with the pairing and appears to have moved on from her long-standing infatuation with Mark. He fences off Andy's juvenile insults and attempts to mess with his and Ann's relationship, but also contends with some jealousy when Ann tries to \\"save\\" her close friend Justin as a potential future mate. Mark planned to propose to Ann, but she had told Leslie she wanted to break up with him, and she did dump him after Leslie narrowly prevented Mark from making what would have been a humiliating proposal during the Diabetes Telethon. Mark and Ann have a breakfast sit-down where Mark says he is shocked that she wanted to end the relationship when they never even fought with each other, but Ann tells him that the lack of conflict meant neither of them really had any passion or stake in the relationship at all, and also says Mark overstated them as a couple because he had never had a relationship that lasted for months before. When the Pawnee government is shut down, Mark decides to take an offered buyout and leave his city hall position for a private-sector job with a construction company, causing Leslie to call him \\"Mark Brendanaquits.\\" In a scene echoing their moment together in the pit during the first season, Mark shares a tender goodbye with Leslie and gives her plans he drafted for the park she wants to build in place of the pit. Development When Mark Brendanawicz was originally conceived, it was anticipated that the character would eventually start to appear infrequently in Parks and Recreation, switching between his city planner job and work in the private sector. Series co-creator Michael Schur said this is because real-life city planners often move back and forth between different jobs. Schur said Mark is partially based on a real-life city planner who eventually got tired of the bureaucratic red tape of government and moved into the private sector, but eventually moved back to government when he was tired of the negative corporate environment. When Paul Schneider was cast as Mark, Schur told him the character might eventually leave Pawnee government and come back working for a different company, then keep moving back and forth in such a manner. Schur said, \\"It's not something you usually do on TV shows but we thought it was a good way to illustrate both the positive and negative aspects of working for a government. It was one of the first things we talked about with [Schneider].\\" Elements of the character were designed based on advice by Scott Albright, a California city planner who worked as a consultant with Parks and Recreation. The discrepancy between Mark's optimism in college and pragmatism after encountering the real world were inspired by feedback Albright provided about the urban planning profession. The Mark character underwent major changes after receiving feedback at press tours and focus group screenings. In the original pilot episode script, Mark was portrayed as slightly less likable than the final character became. For example, in the final episode Mark asked Ron Swanson to green-light the park project to help Leslie, but in the original script, he did so only because he was attracted to Ann and wanted another excuse to keep seeing her. During the first season, Paul Schneider said he was insecure about playing Mark in early episodes because he was still trying to figure out and understand the motivations of his character. Departure It was announced in March 2010 that Schneider would leave Parks and Recreation at the end of the second season. Schur claimed the decision was a combination of the original conception of the character switching between the government and the private sector, as well as Schneider's increasing success in such independent films as Bright Star. In the initial announcement, Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having Schneider return for guest appearances in the future, including in season three. Schur said at the time: \\"He's going to remain in the world of the show in a way that not only allows but hopefully demands that he'll reenter it. He's not going to be killed in some weird accident.\\" Despite Schur's statements, Schneider did not make a return appearance on Parks and Recreation, and the show made no reference to Mark Brendanawicz after Schneider's departure. In a TV show where Schur and other TV comedy showrunners discussed their work, Schur's story about the Season 2 episode where Jerry Gergich found out he was adopted talked about Mark revealing that information but only by referring to Mark as \\"a character\\" who accidentally revealed the truth. During the sixth season, when Ann Perkins extensively reminisced about her past romances, she did not mention Mark, even though they dated for almost all of the second season. In addition, although virtually every major and minor supporting character that ever appeared on Parks and Recreation made at least a cameo appearance in the seventh and final season, Mark was not one of them, nor was he shown in any clips in a flashback montage during the series' final episode. Shortly before the series finale, Schneider stated that he was not interested in returning to the show, and had not been contacted about it. Mark also was not included in the special COVID-19-set episode that aired in 2020.

Built in 1900, it is a good example of Romanesque Revival design. It was built for a working-class congregation to a design by the nationally known church architect George W. Kramer, proponent of the Akron plan of church interiors, which this one follows. and The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The church formerly known as St. Paul's is located in Hartford's Parkville neighborhood, on the north side of Park Street at its junction with Amity Street. It is a modestly scaled brick building, with complex hipped roof arrangement that includes large gables facing both Park and Amity. The Park Street facade is asymmetrical, with a large square tower on the right housing the main entrance, and a smaller one on the left. The gable in between has a band of four square stained glass windows, surmounted by a trio of arched windows, the largest in the center. The flanking tower each have entrances deeply recessed under round arches. The Parkville area developed as an industrial village beginning in the 1870s, experiencing its greatest growth between 1890 and the First World War. St. Paul's was organized in 1891 as a daughter congregation of the South Park Methodist Church, meeting first in private residences and later in a frame church built in 1894. By 1898 the congregation was too large for that building, and the present building was commissioned. It was formally dedicated in 1900. The church tower's upper levels were extensively damaged by the New England Hurricane of 1938, and were removed, leaving the present squat configuration. An extension to the rear was added in the 1950s to provide space for Sunday School instruction. The church congregation merged with the First United Methodist Church in 1975, and moved into the latter's facilities. This building stood vacant for a time, and was purchased in 1979 by the Templo Sion Pentecostal Church, its present occupant.

O'Connell and built in 1914 to serve the city's growing Polish-American population. The interior in particular is decorated with symbols generally found in Catholic churches in Poland, including the Polish eagle. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Saints Cyril and Methodius Church is located south of downtown Hartford, south of Charter Oak Avenue between Charter Oak Place and Popieluszko Court. It is oriented facing east toward Popieluszko Court, and is separated from Charter Oak Avenue by its rectory. It is a large and elaborately styled Romanesque structure, built out of brick with limestone trim. It has a basically rectangular plan, with a gabled roof along its length crowned by a tall tower at the front. A cross gable projects to both sides at the back end of the nave, with a smaller projection at the narthex. There are entrances on the sides of this latter projection and in the center of the main facade, each set in a round-arch opening with rounded windows above. Above each entrance are complexes of tall round-arch windows, the central one rising to the roof level as part of the base of the tower. The tower is crowned by an octagonal spire and cross. Hartford's Polish community grew in the Charter Oak area south of downtown beginning in 1889, as immigrants drawn to jobs in the area. The congregation of Saints Cyril and Methodius was formally organized in 1902, after five years of informal arrangements. It met in a wood-frame church on Charter Oak Avenue built that year. By 1914, the Polish Catholic population had grown to the point where a larger building was needed. The present building was completed in 1916, to a design by Timothy G. O'Connell, an architect based in Boston, Massachusetts.

It was heavily damaged during the Spanish Civil War bombings.http://www.lleidatur.com/ing/modernisme.html It has been in operation since 1998, and is owned by the Lleida city council. It has two stages: Sala 1, an Italian-style hall with 310 seats, and Sala 2, used for plays and performances of a more experimental sort. There's a third space located in the former convent of Saint Theresa. Next to it is the Caf√® del Teatre. Theatre school The Aula Municipal del Teatre de Lleida is a publicly operated theatre school comprising courses both aimed at children and adults, including Studies in Dramatic Art, and a member of the Associaci√≥ Catalana d'Escoles de Teatre (ACET). La Inestable 21 is the young people's theatre company of the school.

Built in 1825-27, it is one of the oldest surviving public buildings in the city. It is the third home of its congregation, which was founded in 1670, and is one of the oldest purely Congregationalist groups in the nation. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Architecture and history The South Congregational Church is located south of downtown Hartford, at the southwest corner of Main and Buckingham Streets. It is a two-story rectangular brick building, fronted by an elaborate tetrastyle Greek Revival temple front, and an elaborate multi-stage tower. The building's interior is reflective of a mid-19th century Greek Revival restyling conducted by architect Minard Lafever. When the Connecticut Colony was established in the 1630s, its religious organizations were dominated by Rev. Thomas Hooker. Following Hooker's death in 1647, issues of church doctrine and governance began to divide his congregation in Hartford. These led to a split in 1670, in which the Second Church was formed by 31 members of that congregation. The congregation claims to adhere to Hooker's original covenant, of which they have a copy in his hand. Its first church was built near this spot, as was the second. The present building was constructed in 1825-27, on land previously occupied by the parsonage of its second minister, Thomas Buckingham. It was built by local master builders Nathaniel Woodhouse and William Hayden, and is one of only four surviving public buildings in the city that was built before 1830. In 1847 a two-story brick addition was made to the rear and side, carefully designed and integrated into the original by Joseph Camp. This addition was extensively damaged by a tornado in 1979.

George Washington in 1772 as colonel of the Virginia Regiment; painting by Charles Willson Peale Rangers First Muster, Spring 1637, Massachusetts Bay Colony Rangers in North America served in the 17th and 18th-century wars between colonists and Native American tribes. The British regulars were not accustomed to frontier warfare and so Ranger companies were developed. Rangers were full- time soldiers employed by colonial governments to patrol between fixed frontier fortifications in reconnaissance, providing early warning of raids. In offensive operations, they were scouts and guides, locating villages and other targets for task forces drawn from the militia or other colonial troops. The father of American ranging is Colonel Benjamin Church (c. 1639‚Äì1718).John Grenier. The First Way of War: American War Making on the Frontier.

Cambridge University Press. 2005. p. 33 Church was commissioned by Plymouth Colony Governor Josiah Winslow to form the first ranger company for King Philip's War. He later employed the company to raid Acadia during King William's War and Queen Anne's War. Benjamin Church designed his force primarily to emulate Native American patterns of war. Toward this end, he endeavored to learn from Native Americans how to fight like Native Americans. Americans became rangers exclusively under the tutelage of the Indian allies. (Until the end of the colonial period, rangers depended on Indians as both allies and teachers.)John Grenier, p. 33-34 Church developed a special full- time unit mixing white colonists, selected for frontier skills, with friendly Native Americans to carry out offensive strikes against hostile Native Americans in terrain where normal militia units were ineffective. Under Church served the father and grandfather of two famous rangers of the eighteenth century: John Lovewell and John Gorham, respectively.The first way of war: American war making on the frontier, 1607‚Äì1814 By John Grenier, p. 38 Rogers' Rangers was established in 1751Churchill's Wizards: The British Genius for Deception, 1914‚Äì1945 (Rankin, Nicholas). p. 454 (2008 paperback) by Major Robert Rogers, who organized nine Ranger companies in the American colonies. These early American light infantry units organized during the French and Indian War were called \\"Rangers\\" and are often considered to be the spiritual birthplace of the modern Army Rangers. Provincial troops The Virginia Regiment under Colonel Washington, was a provincial regiment. Provincial troops were raised by the colonial governors and legislatures for extended operations during the French and Indian Wars. The provincial troops differed from the militia, in that they were a full-time military organization conducting extended operations. They differed from the regular British Army, in that they were recruited only for one campaign season at the time. These forces were often recruited through a quota system applied to the militia. Officers were appointed by the provincial governments. During the eighteenth century militia service was increasingly seen as a prerogative of the social and economic well-established, while provincial troops came to be recruited from different and less deep-rooted members of the community. \\"From Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, 19 December 1756.\\" Founders Online.

The major operations during King William's War were conducted by provincial troops from Massachusetts Bay. During Queen Anne's War provincial troops from Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New Hampshire made up the bulk of the English forces. Watkins, Walter Kendall (1898).

During the French and Indian War the imperial government in London took an increasingly more leading part, relegating the provincial troops to a non-combat role, largely as pioneers and transportation troops, while the bulk of the fighting was done by the regular British Army. However the contributions of Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island were essential.Stacey 1974, p. xxviii. Militia The beginning of the United States military lies in local governments which created militias that enrolled nearly all free white men. The British Army and Royal Navy handled international wars. The militia was not employed as a fighting force in major operations outside the local jurisdiction. Instead, the colony asked for (and paid) volunteers serving in ranger and other provincial troops (see above), many of whom were also militia members. The local Indian threat ended by 1725 in most places, after which the militia system was little used except for local ceremonial roles. The militia system was revived at the end of the colonial era, as the American Revolution approached; weapons were accumulated and intensive training began. The militia played a major fighting role in the Revolution, especially in expelling the British from Boston in 1776 and capturing the invading British Army at Saratoga in 1777. However most of the fighting was handled by the Continental Army, comprising regular soldiers.John Shy, A People Numerous and Armed: Reflections on the Military Struggle for American Independence (2nd ed. 2008) Indian wars Military actions in the colonies were the result of conflicts with Native Americans in the early years of the British colonization of North America, such as in the Anglo-Powhatan Wars between 1610 and 1646, the Pequot War of 1637, King Philip's War in 1675, the Susquehannock war in 1675‚Äì77,See \\"The Susquehannock War 1675-77\\" and the Yamasee War in 1715. Father Rale's War (1722‚Äì1725) happened in Maine and Nova Scotia. There also occurred slave uprisings, such as the Stono Rebellion in 1739. Finally, there was Father Le Loutre's War, which also involved Acadians, in the lead-up to the French and Indian War. Dutch wars Kieft's War was a conflict between Dutch settlers and Indians in the colony of New Netherland from 1643 to 1645. The fighting involved raids and counter-raids. It was bloody in proportion to the population; more than 1,600 natives were killed at a time when the European population of New Amsterdam was only 250. Spanish wars The British fought the Spanish in the War of Jenkins' Ear, 1739‚Äì1748. After 1742, the war merged into the larger War of the Austrian Succession involving most of the powers of Europe. Georgia beat back a Spanish invasion of Georgia in 1742, and some sporadic border fighting continued. The war merged into King George's War, which ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. France and Britain at war Beginning in 1689, the colonies also frequently became involved in a series of four major wars between Britain and France for control of North America, the most important of which were Queen Anne's War, in which the British won French Acadia (Nova Scotia), and the final French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763), when France lost all of Canada. This final war gave thousands of colonists military experience, including George Washington, which they put to use during the American Revolution. Britain and France fought a series of four French and Indian Wars, followed with another war in 1778 when France joined the Americans in the American Revolution. The French settlers in New France were outnumbered 15‚Äì1 by the 13 American colonies,In 1690, New France had about 12,000 inhabitants, while the American colonists numbered over 200,000. By 1760, the numbers were about 60,000 and 1.6 million, respectively. so the French relied heavily on Indian allies. The wars were long and bloody, causing immense suffering for everyone involved. In the long run, the Indians were the biggest losers; many were on the losing side, as Spain and France were defeated. When the British finally won full control, the Indian power was sharply limited. Frontier settlers were exposed to sudden Indian raids; many were killed or captured, and even more were forced back from the frontier. One profitable form of wartime activity in which colonists engaged was privateering‚Äîlegalized piracy against enemy merchant ships. Another was hunting enemy Indians for the purpose of scalping them and claiming the cash bounty offered by colonial governments.Anderson (1960) King William's War: 1689‚Äì1697 \\"I have no reply to make to your general other than from the mouth of my cannons and muskets.\\" Frontenac famously rebuffs the English envoys at the Battle of Quebec (1690) King William's War (1689‚Äì97) (also known as the \\"Nine Years' War\\") A short history is online by Evarts Boutell Greene, Provincial America, 1690-1740 (1905) ch 8 online pp 119-35. was a phase of the larger Anglo-French conflict for colonial domination throughout the world. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia by raiding settlements south of present-day Maine, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Sir William Phips moved with his New England militia in 1690 to take the French strongholds at Port Royal and at Quebec, the latter commanded by Comte de Frontenac, the governor of New France. Phips conquered the capital of Acadia and various other communities in the colony (e.g., Battle of Chedabucto). (Present-day Maine and New Brunswick remained contested territories between New England and New France.) Phips's written ultimatum demanding Fontenac's surrender at Quebec prompted Frontenac to say that his reply would come only \\"from the mouths of my cannon and muskets.\\" The New England militia had to reckon with Quebec's formidable natural defenses, its superior number of soldiers, and the coming of winter, and Phips finally sailed back to Boston with his hungry, smallpox-ridden, and demoralized force. His failure shows a growing recognition of the need to replicate European combat techniques and to move closer to England's war policy in order to achieve military success.K. A. J. McLay, \\"Wellsprings of a 'World War': an Early English Attempt to Conquer Canada During King William's War, 1688‚Äì97,\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 2006 34(2): 155‚Äì175, Iroquois Six Nations c. 1720 The Iroquois suffered heavily in King William's War and were brought into the French trading network, along with other western Indians. The colonists' treatment of Indian tribes after King Philip's War led directly the Wabanaki tribe's involvement in the war. It retained significant power relative to the colonists, unlike tribes in southern New England, and rejected attempts to exert authority over them. Treaties made during 1678‚Äì84 included concessions to Indian sovereignty, but such concessions were largely ignored in practice. Expanding settlements fueled tensions and led to Indian threats of a repeat of the violence of King Philip's War and offered an opportunity to the French, who wanted to counter English influence in the region. The lack of stability and authority evidenced by the imprisonment of Governor Andros in 1689 combined with existing grievances and French encouragement led to Wabanaki attacks on settlements on the Northeast coast, a pattern that was repeated until the withdrawal of the French in 1763.Jenny Hale Pulsipher, \\"'Dark Cloud Rising from the East': Indian Sovereignty and the Coming of King William's War in New England,\\" New England Quarterly 2007 80(4): 588‚Äì613 Queen Anne's War Francis Nicholson, commander during the Conquest of Acadia Queen Anne's War (1702‚Äì1713) was the colonial side of the War of the Spanish Succession which was fought primarily in Europe on European issues, The conflict also involved a number of American Indian tribes and Spain, which was allied with France. A short history is online by Evarts Boutell Greene, Provincial America, 1690-1740 (1905) ch 9 online pp 136-153. Carolina governor James Moore led an unsuccessful attack in 1702 on St. Augustine, the capital of Spanish Florida, and led one of several raiding expeditions in 1704-6 that wiped out much of Florida's Indian population. Thomas Nairne, the Province of Carolina's Indian agent, planned an expedition of British soldiers and their Indian allies to destroy the French settlement at Mobile and the Spanish settlement at Pensacola. The expedition never materialized, but the British did supply their allies with firearms, which the Tallapoosas used in their siege of Pensacola. These warriors proved their effectiveness in combining native tactics and European arms, but the English failed to compensate them adequately and seriously underestimated their importance as the key to the balance of power in the southeastern interior. Consequently, the Tallapoosas and other tribes had shifted allegiance to the other side by 1716 and prepared to use what they had learned against South Carolina settlements.Steven Oatis, \\"'To Eat up a Village of White Men': Anglo-Indian Designs on Mobile and Pensacola, 1705‚Äì1715,\\" Gulf South Historical Review 1998 14(1): 104‚Äì119, The French and Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. Toward this end, they executed raids against targets in Massachusetts (including present-day Maine), starting with Northeast Coast Campaign. In 1704, French and Indian forces attacked a number of villages and Deerfield, Massachusetts was prepared for an attack. The attack came during the night of 28 February 1704; much of the village was burned, many were killed, and others were taken captive. Seventeen of the captives were killed along the way to Canada, as they were injured and could not keep up, and starvation took additional lives. Major Benjamin Church retaliated by raiding Acadia (see Raid on Grand Pre) and captured prisoners for ransom, the most famous Acadian captive being Noel Doiron. Eventually, 53 New England captives returned home, including one of the targets of the invaders, the Reverend John Williams. His accounts of the experience made him famous throughout the colonies.John Demos, The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story from Early America (1995) South Carolina was especially vulnerable, and Charleston repulsed an attempted raid by French and Spanish fleets in the summer of 1706. French privateers inflicted serious losses on New England's fishing and shipping industries. The privateering was finally curbed in 1710 when Britain provided military support to its American colonists resulting in the British Conquest of Acadia (which became peninsular Nova Scotia), the main base used by the privateers.Verner W. Crane, \\"The Southern Frontier in Queen Anne's War,\\" American Historical Review Vol. 24, No. 3 (Apr., 1919), pp. 379‚Äì395 The war ended with a British victory in 1713. By the Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained Acadia, the island of Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay region, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. France was required to recognize British authority over the Iroquois. Following Queen Anne's War, relations deteriorated between Carolina and the nearby Indian populations, resulting in the Yamasee War of 1715. Father Rale's War a few years later, shifted power in the northeast. Father Rale's War War continued in Acadia, however. Father Rale's War (1722‚Äì1725), also known as Dummer's War, was a series of battles between New England and the Wabanaki Confederacy, who were allied with New France. After the New England Conquest of Acadia in 1710, mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of New England, but both present-day New Brunswick and virtually all of present-day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France. New France established Catholic missions among the three largest native villages in order to secure their claim to the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock), one further north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot), and one on the St. John River (Medoctec).John Grenier, The Far Reaches of Empire. University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, p. 51, p. 54. The war began on two fronts when New England expanded through Maine and when New England established a settlement at Canso, Nova Scotia. Maine fell to the New Englanders with the defeat of Father S√©bastien Rale at Norridgewock and the subsequent retreat of the Indians from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers to St. Francis and Becancour, Quebec.New Englanders safely settled the land, but Massachusetts did not officially lay claim to the entire Penobscot watershed until the treaty of 1752, and the Pownall Expedition led by Governor Thomas Pownall in 1759 established Fort Pownall on Cape Jellison in what is now Stockton Springs. King George's War The Capture of Louisburg, 1745 by Peter Monamy King George's War (1744‚Äì48) was the North American phase of the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1745, naval and ground forces from Massachusetts captured the strategic French base on Cape Breton Island in the Siege of Louisbourg. During the war, the French made four attempts to regain Acadia by capturing the capital Annapolis Royal, the most famous attempt being the failed Duc d'Anville expedition. They regained fortress Louisbourg at the peace treaty. The French led Indian allies in numerous raids, such as the one on Nov. 28, 1745 which destroyed the village of Saratoga, New York, killing and capturing more than one hundred of its inhabitants. The war merged into War of Jenkins' Ear against Spain and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Father Le Loutre's War Within Acadia and Nova Scotia, Father Le Loutre's War (1749‚Äì1755) began when the British founded Halifax. During Father Le Loutre's War, New France established three forts along the border of present- day New Brunswick to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British victory at Fort Beausejour, which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, Acadians, and Mi'kmaq.John Grenier. The Edge of Empire: War In Nova Scotia. 2008. French and Indian War: 1754‚Äì1763 Provincial troops, as distinct from the militias, were raised by the 13 colonial governments in response to annual quotas established by the British commanders-in-chief. These troops saw service in most campaigns and employment throughout North America during the Seven Years' War. =Pennsylvania= The war began in 1754 as Virginia militia led by Colonel George Washington advanced into French-held territory near modern-day Pittsburgh. Washington was captured at Fort Necessity after ambushing a French company and released. He returned with the 2,100 British regulars and American colonials under British General Edward Braddock, which was decisively destroyed at the Battle of the Monongahela in July 1755. All sites referenced lie within the geographical and historical boundaries of Pennsylvania =Acadia / Nova Scotia= St. John River Campaign: A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross (present day Gagetown, New Brunswick) by Thomas Davies in 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians. Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Acadia/ Nova Scotia remained dominated by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. The British did not make a concerted military effort to control the region until 1749 when they founded Halifax, which sparked Father Le Loutre's War. The French and Indian War spread to the region with a British victory in the Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour (1755). Immediately after this battle the New England and British forces engaged in numerous military campaigns, which became known as the Expulsion of the Acadians. =New York= British defenders at Fort William Henry (at the southern end of Lake George) were surrounded by an overwhelming French force and their Indian allies from many tribes in August 1757. The British surrendered to the French after being offered terms that included protection from the Indians. Nonetheless, the Indian warriors' customs permitted the enslavement of some captured enemy soldiers and the scalping of others, and they ignored French efforts to prevent the massacre. They killed or captured hundreds of the surrendered British force, including women, children, servants, and slaves. Some of those scalped had smallpox, and the scalps were brought to numerous Indian villages as trophies, where they caused an epidemic that killed thousands of Indians. In early July 1758, British General James Abercromby with a force of over 15,000 attacked General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and his garrison of 3,500 French and Canadian troops at Fort Carillon, which overlooked Lake Champlain. The British had 44 cannons, the heaviest weighing more than 5,000 pounds. The fort was later called Ticonderoga by the British, and it controlled access to French Canada. Abercromby's force included 5,825 red-coated British regulars, including the Royal Highlanders. He had 9,000 colonials from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Some 400 Mohawk warriors joined in. Abercromby's attack became disorganized and he suffered the worst British defeat of the war, with over 2,000 killed. He retreated and the campaign ended in failure. =Louisbourg= Siege of Louisbourg (1758) Meanwhile, Lord Jeffery Amherst captured the great French stronghold of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island (now part of Nova Scotia). Amherst's large British naval force of over 170 ships and 13,000 men came under furious attack by French defenders until British General James Wolfe found a safe landing spot out of sight of the French. The ultimately successful siege lasted seven weeks. With the fall of Louisbourg, the New England and British forces engaged in the second phase of the Expulsion of the Acadians from the region. =Canada= In London, Prime Minister William Pitt named Amherst as his new commander-in-chief of North America for 1759. The Louisbourg victory opened the St. Lawrence River to British incursions, and Amherst devised a three-pronged attack against French Canada: a push up the St. Lawrence to attack Quebec, another northward invasion from Albany by way of lakes George and Champlain, and pressure against the French in the west at Fort Niagara. The 1759 battle for Quebec City was fought on the Plains of Abraham and decided the future of Canada, as British forces under General James Wolfe defeated the French army of General Louis-Joseph Montcalm. Both generals were killed. =Legacy= Anderson (2006) suggests that the war played a pivotal precipitating role in the American Revolution. He believes that the United States has become an imperial nation through the influence of this war, and suggests that it should perhaps be known as \\"the War That Made America.\\" The Fort William Henry massacre has shaped American cultural attitudes toward Indians. It was only one of many episodes of indiscriminate bloodshed and captive-taking and deranged relations between Indians and Anglo-American colonists. Even in Pennsylvania, a colony that had never known an Indian war before 1755, resentment against Indians became something like a majority sentiment by 1764. Most Indian groups sided with the British in the Revolution, and the animosity only grew.Anderson (2006) American novelist James Fenimore Cooper wrote The Last of the Mohicans in 1826, a widely read novel that was adapted for several Hollywood films. Cooper refers to the dangerous \\"savages\\" and shows their willingness to kill. The book creates a lasting impression of the untrustworthiness and dangerousness of Indians in general, according to Michael Hilger. One long- standing theme in American popular culture has portrayed the Indians as revenge-seeking savages looking to scalp their enemies.Michael Hilger, From Savage to Nobleman: Images of Native Americans in Film (1995); Peter C. Rollins and John E. O'Connor, eds., Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film (1998). The victory of Wolfe over Montcalm was a decisive moment in shaping the self-image of British Canada, while Francophone Canada has refused to allow commemorations.See Desmond Morton, \\"Who really won on the Plains of Abraham?\\" Financial Post Nov. 10, 2009 Pontiac's rebellion Zone of action in Pontiac's Rebellion In 1760, British commander Lord Amherst abruptly ended the distribution of gifts of ironware, weapons, and ammunition to the Indians, a French practice that the Indians had become dependent upon. Chief Pontiac (1720‚Äì1769) was a chief of the Ottawa tribe who assumed leadership in the Detroit area; other chiefs in the loose confederation of tribes directed attacks on all British forts in the Great Lakes area in the spring of 1763. Eight outposts were overrun, and English supply lines were cut across Lake Erie; assaults failed on Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt. At this point, news arrived of the complete French capitulation and withdrawal from North America, and the uprising quickly collapsed. Few American military units were involved, as British regulars handled the action. London issued a proclamation in October 1763 forbidding whites to enter Indian territory west of the Appalachian Mountains, hoping to minimize future conflict and laying plans for an Indian satellite state in the Great Lakes region.Howard H. Peckham, Pontiac and the Indian Uprising (1947); Richard Middleton, Pontiac's War: Its Causes, Course, and Consequences (2007) By expelling the French Empire from North America, the British victory made it impossible for the Iroquois and other native groups to play rival powers against one another. The Indians who had been allied with France realized their weak position when the British began to treat them as conquered foes. They reacted with violence to Britain's abrupt changes in the terms of trade and suspension of diplomatic gift giving, launching an insurrection by driving British troops from western forts and sending raiding parties that caused panic as refugees fled east. The Indian coalition forced the British to rescind the offending policies and renew giving gifts. By 1764, the various tribes came to terms with Britain, and Indian leaders realized that their war- fighting ability was crippled. Without a competing empire to arm and supply them, they simply could not keep fighting once they ran out of gunpowder and lead.Anderson (2006); David Dixon, Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America (2005). The Proclamation of 1763 angered American settlers eager to move west; they largely ignored it, and saw the imperial government as an ally of the Indians and an obstacle to their goals. As Dixon (2007) argues, \\"Frustrated by their government's inability to contend with the Indians, back country settlers concluded that the best way to insure security was to rely on their own devices.\\" Such actions eventually pushed them into direct conflict with the British government and ultimately proved one of the main forces leading to backcountry support for the American Revolution.David Dixon, Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America (2005), quoting p. xii See also * Military history of the United States ReferencesFurther reading * Allison, William Thomas, Jeffrey Grey, and Janet G.

Originally built by an Episcopal congregation, it has for many years been home to an African-American Baptist congregation, which under the leadership of Rev. John C. Jackson (1866-1953), played a significant role in advancing the cause of civil rights in the state. The church, and its adjacent parsonage, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Architecture and history The Union Baptist Church is locate in Hartford's northern Clay-Arsenal neighborhood, on the west side of Main Street near its junction with Mahl Avenue. It is an Early English Gothic stone structure, designed by Henry Martyn Congdon and built in 1871, with a number of later additions. It has a roughly cruciform plan, with a rounded apse and short transepts. The main entrance is set near the rear end of the south side, under a Stick style gabled portico. Modern additions housing offices and other facilities extend further to the rear. The church was built in 1871, and was original known as the Saint Thomas Episcopal Church, honoring Thomas Brownell, the founder of Hartford's Trinity College. It was acquired by the Baptist congregation of Rev. John C. Jackson in 1925; this congregation had been founded in 1871 by a group of freed slaves from Virginia. Jackson was an early force in advancing civil rights in Connecticut, and is credited with securing a position for the first African-American teacher in the city's public schools. Members of the congregation have also historically occupied important civic and social positions in the community.

In the series, Ron is the director of the Parks and Recreation department of fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, and the immediate superior of series protagonist Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) until Knope's election to the Pawnee City Council at the end of Season 4. In demeanor, political philosophy and work ethic, Knope and Swanson are polar opposites: where Knope is sunny and outgoing, decidedly tolerant and constantly working, Swanson is distant, and as a staunch libertarian, is a strong advocate for small government‚Äîstating his belief that government should be privatized‚Äîand therefore believes that the parks department should not even exist. He says he is there to rot the beast from the inside. Ron, who has an extremely deadpan and stereotypical masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, breakfast foods, nautical literature, and sex. He hates and fears his ex-wives, both named Tammy, one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie. Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron has been a central character since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California. Offerman's portrayal of Ron Swanson has received widespread critical acclaim. The character developed a cult following and is widely considered the breakout character of the series. Schur called Ron \\"our cast MVP.\\" He was described by some critics as one of the best characters in a situation comedy in decades, and has been called the best comedic character on television since Cosmo Kramer of Seinfeld. Ron's platonic relationship with Leslie has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Offerman received several award nominations for the role, and won the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, tying with Ty Burrell of Modern Family. Background Despite Ron being a very private person, including getting his birthdate redacted from all public documents, his background does occasionally come up. He was born in a small town to Tamara \\"Tammy\\" Swanson and a father unnamed in the series. He grew up on a farm in a small town and is shown to have enjoyed woodworking from an early age, building his first chair at age 5. Ron is opposed to child labor laws, stating he got his first job at a sheet metal factory at age 9 and, in two weeks, was running the floor. Ron says that at age 11, he was offered a higher paying job at the tannery and attempted to do both jobs while going to middle school before realizing it would be better to only work at the sheet metal factory saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt half-ass two things - whole-ass one thing.\\" Ron claimed that, at age 12, he went to prom and was working at a quarry. When he was 15, Ron moved in with his first wife, Tammy 1, who was a candy striper at the hospital when he was born, and subsequently both his math and Sunday school teacher; he has said that although the circumstances of their relationship were considered scandalous, people were too afraid of her to say anything. Ron said that when he was 18, his father wanted him to work at the steel mill, but he chose to go to college instead. Ron Swanson had been director of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department for six years at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government. Despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government is a waste of taxpayer money. Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government. Ron puts almost no effort into his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do the vast majority of the work. Despite differing personalities and ideologies, Ron and his deputy director Leslie Knope, (played by Amy Poehler, pictured) have a deep respect for each other. Ron particularly despises talking to members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him; a claymore mine (which he eventually learns is a toy in the season 7 episode \\"Leslie and Ron\\"), the front of which is pointed toward guests; and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him \\\\- often referring to his colleagues as ‚Äúworkplace proximity acquaintances‚Äù - and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for his assistant April Ludgate's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the \\"Ron Swanson Scholarship\\" ($940) so Andy can attend a women's studies college course after Andy and April could not afford to pay for it. In the voiceover during which Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he should not bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway. Ron speaks in a deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, although he is often shown to be very giddy when it comes to riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a school bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He describes fishing as \\"like yoga, except I still get to kill something.\\" He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as \\"strong, self-possessed women at the top of their fields,\\" with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon- wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon- wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as \\"The Swanson.\\" He also drinks heavily (once specifying his weekly consumption of alcohol to be \\"one shelf\\") but seldom feels the effects of alcohol or gets hung over, which is shown to be a trait that runs in his family; his mother is able to do the same, and he once mentioned that his father \\"used to pour Wild Turkey on his cornflakes\\". He primarily drinks scotch whisky (with a preference for Lagavulin) claiming that \\"Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.\\" He is an extremely private person, going so far as to redact his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him (though he did reluctantly provide it as \\"springtime\\" on a hospital admission form). Despite this, Leslie knows about his birthday and regularly gives Ron personal birthday gifts. Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; he recognizes the name Julia Roberts only as the \\"toothy gal from Mystic Pizza,‚Äù he once confused the Star Wars film franchise with Harry Potter, and on Pawnee Today he reveals that the only movies he's seen at that point are The Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton and Herbie: Fully Loaded (the first having been provided by Leslie on one of his birthdays in the episode \\"Eagleton\\" and the latter watched with Diane's two daughters). He enjoys the music of Willie Nelson, being shown listening to \\"Hello Walls\\" and \\"Buddy\\" during the series. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia; he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night until April offered to take him to the hospital. Before the start of Parks and Recreation, Ron has two ex-wives, both of whom are named Tammy, which is also the name of Ron's mother. Ron despises and fears both of his ex-wives, and they are among the few individuals in the world who can break Ron's usually unwavering stoicism. Nevertheless, Ron shares an extremely passionate sexual connection with his second ex-wife; he compared having sex with her to \\"doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours,\\" and added, \\"That woman really knows her way around a penis.\\" Ron is so susceptible to Tammy 2's sexual temptations that he made a video-tape warning himself about her to play in case he ever got back together with her. Ron plays the saxophone, and secretly performs at out-of-town jazz clubs under the name Duke Silver, which he keeps secret from his colleagues in Pawnee. He wears a trilby hat and suit jacket while playing, fronts a band called the Duke Silver Trio, and has released such albums as Memories of Now, Smooth as Silver, and Hi Ho, Duke. His music is especially popular with older women (among them being April's mother), who find Duke Silver extremely attractive. Ron appears in every episode with the exception of \\"Beauty Pageant\\", where it is explained that he is recovering from surgery due to a hernia. Storyline=Season One Ron Swanson made his first appearance in the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, where he repeatedly denies Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park because he does not believe the parks department should build parks at all. He agrees to green-light the project only when city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) secretly cashes in an unspecified favor in exchange for the approval (Later, in the episode Practice Date, it could be assumed that Mark already knew about Ron's alter ego since he told Tom to visit an Eagleton Club where Tom could see Duke Silver. We can assume that the favor Mark uses, was in return to keep Ron's alter ego a secret.) In a deleted scene from the episode \\"Canvassing\\", Ron tries to leave government employment for a previously offered job at an Internet flower company. However, when he finds that business is now doing extremely poorly, Ron sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In the episode \\"Boys' Club\\", Ron attends a disciplinary hearing with Leslie after she gets in trouble when the underage April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) is seen drinking alcohol on a video on the Pawnee website. Ron interrupts half-way through the review, defends Leslie and angrily berates the panel for aggressively questioning her. Although Ron claims he did it only due to his hatred for bureaucratic procedures, it is implied that he really did so out of respect for Leslie. Season Two Ron hires April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza, pictured) as his assistant, and he becomes a father figure to her. In \\"Practice Date,\\" when the parks department employees hold a contest to find who can learn the biggest secrets about each other, Ron discovers Tom's marriage to the attractive surgeon Wendy (Jama Williamson) is actually a green card marriage. Ron promises he will keep Tom's arrangement a secret. Later, Tom discovers Ron playing the saxophone at a bar in his Duke Silver persona. Tom agrees to keep Ron's secret as well. Later in the season, when Tom's divorce with Wendy is finalized in \\"Tom's Divorce,\\" Ron politely asks whether Tom would mind if he asked Wendy out himself, and explains, \\"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.\\" Tom outwardly claims to be fine with it but, unbeknownst to Ron, is secretly upset because he actually harbors real romantic feelings for Wendy. Ron's second ex-wife, Pawnee library director Tammy (Megan Mullally), appeared in the episode \\"Ron and Tammy,\\" where Tammy tricks Leslie into arranging a reunion meeting with Ron under the guise of wishing to work out her differences with him. In fact, Tammy schemed to get Ron to give her the rights to land Leslie plans to turn into a park, so Tammy can build a library branch there instead. During their meeting, Ron and Tammy start loudly arguing, but eventually have passionate sex and get back together. Unable to resist Tammy's charms, Ron asks Leslie to break up with Tammy for him. When Leslie stands up to Tammy in Ron's defense, he is moved by what he describes as the first time any woman has put his needs before her own, and it gives him the strength to finally break up with Tammy. In \\"Hunting Trip,\\" Leslie insists that Ron take her and the other female parks department employees on one of his private hunting expeditions at the park ranger cabin. Ron begrudgingly agrees, but is frustrated to learn that Leslie is in fact an excellent hunter who overshadows his own abilities. During this trip, Ron is shot in the back of the head by misfired birdshot, and becomes hallucinatory and furious after taking multiple painkillers with alcohol. He initially accuses Leslie of shooting him based on her desire to prove herself, but later learns Tom was at fault and that Leslie took the blame to keep Tom from being arrested for hunting without a license. Ron is strongly impressed that Leslie defended Tom this way, and refers to her as \\"a stand-up guy,\\" which leaves Leslie overjoyed. In \\"The Set Up,\\" a new citywide effort is implemented to make government officials more accessible to Pawnee residents, an idea which Ron condemns as \\"my hell.\\" As a result, he seeks to hire an assistant who will shield him from the public and allow him to continue doing nothing. After interviewing several candidates, he chooses April Ludgate, convinced her constant apathy and negative attitude will suit him perfectly. Their relationship proves very harmonious until the episode \\"94 Meetings,\\" when April accidentally schedules nearly 93 meetings not counting one with her, on a single day. April previously kept people who wanted to meet with Ron away by scheduling them for a meeting on March 31, a date she wrongly believed was nonexistent. When March 31 actually comes around, Ron has to enroll help from others in the park department to handle the meetings. He becomes so furious with April that she quits, but Ron later apologizes and hires her back. In \\"The Master Plan,\\" state auditors Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) arrive in Pawnee and announce that due to the city's crippling budget problems, they have to slash each department budget by up to 50 percent and briefly shut down the government completely. While Leslie is horrified, the anti-government Ron is delighted by the idea, becoming so giddy that he asks the auditors what cuts they will be making and if he can be allowed to \\"watch while eating pork cracklins.\\" In the season finale, \\"Freddy Spaghetti,\\" Ron is assigned to a committee tasked with identifying budget cuts, a job which he enjoys thoroughly. However, when Ben and Chris reveal they are considering firing Leslie, Ron passionately defends her and insists they should fire him instead. During the final scene of the episode and season, Tom spots Ron and Wendy together in city hall and realizes with horror that they are now dating. Season Three The third season opens with Ron seen begrudgingly returning to his city hall job after the Pawnee government has been shut down for three months. Ron starts to become a father figure of sorts to April and Andy (Chris Pratt) during the third season, despite his insistence that \\"I'm not interested in caring about people.\\" When April is hospitalized with influenza in \\"Flu Season,\\" she starts to explain her relationship problems with Andy, but Ron insists he does not want to know about her private affairs. However, after Ron hires Andy to be her temporary replacement, the two spend the day bonding and Ron, against his better judgment, tells Andy that April is in the hospital and that he should visit her. Later in the season, in \\"Media Blitz,\\" Ron gets even further involved by chastising April for leading Andy on, and urges her to either forgive Andy or move on. His advice ultimately helps April decide to forgive Andy. ex-wife of Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari, pictured) causes tension between the two characters. Ron finds himself very happy in his relationship with Wendy, although it creates tension between him and Tom. This tension culminates in \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two,\\" when Tom brings Tammy to a party as his date simply to aggravate Ron. This occurs, however, the same day that Wendy and Ron break up, after she decides she must move back to Canada to care for her ailing parents. Ron and Tammy end up having a wild night of drinking and sex, in which Ron gets cornrows, he and Tammy get remarried and the two end up in jail. The parks department employees hold an intervention to try to convince Ron to leave Tammy, but their efforts are unsuccessful. After Tom reveals that Tammy only went to the party with him to make Ron miserable, Tammy brutally beats up Tom. This makes Ron remember how horrible Tammy is and he leaves her, thus ending their marriage for a second time, and Ron and Tom later reconcile. Shortly after Leslie successfully relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, she struggles to find any new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode \\"Camping,\\" locks her in a room and refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party,\\" where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: \\"Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do.\\" At which point Leslie Knope replies \\"Wait, weren't you married 3 times?\\" To which Ron replies \\"My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy.\\" In \\"Eagleton,\\" Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies. When city manager Chris Traeger tries to remove red meat from the city hall cafeteria as part of a government-wide health initiative in \\"Soulmates,\\" Ron intervenes by challenging Chris to a cook-off. Chris agrees to abandon his plan if Ron's regular hamburgers are deemed better than his lean meat turkey burgers. Although Ron exerts little effort compared to Chris, his burgers easily win the contest. In \\"Road Trip,\\" Ron reluctantly agrees to be interviewed by a young girl for her school assignment, during which he explains his libertarian beliefs about small government, and illustrates the concept of taxes by eating 40 percent of her lunch. The two bond, and he ends the day by giving her a claymore landmine as a gift. Ron gets in trouble the next day when the girl's mother explains her daughter's assignment was \\"Why Government Matters,\\" and that Lauren simply wrote \\"It doesn't.\\" Ron learns in the third-season finale, \\"Li'l Sebastian,\\" that Leslie and Ben are secretly having an affair despite Chris' ban on workplace romances, and he warns them they are risking a political scandal that could cost them their jobs. Later, at the funeral of Pawnee's celebrity miniature horse Li'l Sebastian, Ron is nearly killed as a result of Leslie and Ben's affair. When their efforts to hide their relationship accidentally cause Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame to be filled with lighter fluid instead of propane, Ron creates a massive fireball when he lights it, which burns off his eyebrows and part of his mustache. The season ends as a horrified Ron learns that his first ex-wife, Tammy, has arrived to see him; the news is enough to make his second ex-wife, also named Tammy, run away in horror. Season Four In \\"I'm Leslie Knope,\\" Ron grabs an emergency survival bag and flees to live in the wilderness after learning that his first ex-wife Tammy 1 (Patricia Clarkson) has arrived in town. When Leslie's campaign managers decide to announce her candidacy for city council sooner than expected, she panics and also flees to the wilderness to hide out with Ron. Together they realize they cannot run from their problems and they both return to the parks department. Tammy 1, who is an IRS agent, later meets up with Ron in his office and serves him audit papers. In \\"Ron and Tammys\\" Tammy 1 assumes control of Ron, turning him into a mustache-less pushover in an effort to remarry him and take all his hidden gold. This is quite the difference compared to the influence Ron's latest ex (Tammy 2) has over him. While Tammy 1 has an ice cold personality and reduces Ron into submissiveness and quietude, Tammy 2 causes Ron to make highly irrational decisions that end up jeopardizing his position at the Parks office. Tammy 2 also tries to assume control of Ron through using manipulation of her body. Ron is saved from the grasp of Tammy 1 after his own mother, who is also ironically a Tammy- her name is Tamara (he refers to her as Tammy 0) to restore her son. He snaps back to his old self after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first one out of the contest. In the end, Ron finally comes to his senses and stands up for himself and tells both Tammys to leave. Season Five In \\"How a Bill becomes a Law,\\" Ron meets Diane Lewis (Lucy Lawless) who had been ignored when asking about filling in a pothole. Ron becomes a friend of hers and, in \\"Halloween Surprise,\\" he takes her two daughters out trick-or-treating and they begin dating. In \\"Women in Garbage,\\" while babysitting Diane's daughters, he admits to Ann he loves Diane. Later in the episode, she admits she also loves him. In the fifth- season finale \\"Are You Better Off?,\\" Andy is talking to Ron about a pregnancy test he found when Diane comes in and says she needs to talk to him, leaving the question if she is pregnant in a cliffhanger. Season Six In the sixth-season premiere \\"London,\\" Diane reveals that she is pregnant. Ron proposes, and she accepts on the condition they not have a huge wedding. They immediately get married on the fourth floor before he joins Leslie on a trip to London, which he despises, and the Lagavulin distillery in Scotland, which he heartily enjoys. Later in the season, Ron and Diane have a son, whom they name John. During The Unity Concert in the season finale, Ron reveals himself as Duke Silver to the public when he takes the stage with Mouse Rat. Season Seven Three years after Season 6, at the start of Season 7 in 2017, Leslie and Ron's relationship of being \\"work-place proximity associates\\" (what Ron calls his friends) has emaciated. Both have left the Parks Department, with Ron having started his own construction company. Both are competing in a bidding war for a piece of land in Pawnee owned by the Newport family. Leslie wishes to turn it into a national park, while Ron's company has partnered with GRYZZL to turn it into a new corporate campus. After a function where the two teams present their proposals, Leslie and Ron have a bitter exchange of words, prompting Ben and the rest of the team to lock the both of them in the Parks Department overnight, during which the two reconcile their differences. After much prying, Leslie learns the real story from Ron's side. After she took Jerry and April to work with her, and Tom and Donna left to run their businesses, Ron didn't recognize anyone he worked with anymore, prompting him to make an unthinkable decision: to ask Leslie for a job in the federal government, so he could work with people he knew again. However, he reminds Leslie how she unknowingly stood him up for lunch due to her new hectic life, which he felt was the \\"punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.\\" So Ron left the Parks Department and began his construction company. He and Leslie are eventually able to settle their differences and rekindle their friendship. In a series of flash-forwards in the final episode, it is shown that Ron decides to leave his now-successful construction company. He is shown talking to Ben Wyatt about having diversified his funds by selling half his gold. The flash-forward reveals that Ron purchased 51% interest in the Lagavulin distillery. Feeling his life lacks purpose, he asks Leslie for advice and she arranges for him to be the new superintendent of the Pawnee National Park. One of the last shots of Ron in the series features him \\"at work,\\" happily paddling a canoe around the lake in the park to the tune of \\"Buddy\\" by Willie Nelson. Development Ron Swanson was created by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, although Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that \\"NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said they wanted me to play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally acquiesced.\\" The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, \\"I don't really believe in the mission of my job... I'm aware of the irony.\\" Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache was one of the first ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: \\"I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit.\\" Many aspects of Ron's character are based on those of Nick Offerman in real life, such as his woodworking abilities; Offerman runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop. Offerman also plays saxophone in real life, just as Ron does, although the Parks and Recreation writers did not know this when they wrote this element of his character. Offerman's real-life training in stage combat and Kabuki dance were the partial inspiration for self-defense classes Ron offered his parks department colleagues in \\"Park Safety.\\" Ron's second ex-wife Tammy, who first appeared in the episode \\"Ron and Tammy,\\" was played by comedian and actress Megan Mullally, Offerman's real-life wife. The idea of Ron hating his ex-wife Tammy was established early in the creation of the character, and it was Schur who conceived the idea of casting Mullally, an idea to which Offerman was extremely responsive. Ron became more heavily involved in Parks and Recreation storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur with the development of the character. Schur has described Offerman as a \\"once-in- a-generation comedic performer,\\" and \\"our cast MVP, and in many ways our cast leader.\\" He compared Ron to a \\"19th-century rugged individualist,\\" and said of creating the character, \\"A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy.\\" Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels, and the writing staff; he added: \\"I never dreamed that I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show.\\" Schur said the staff liked writing for Ron because \\"he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and very human and vulnerable person.\\" Reception=Reviews The character of Ron Swanson received universal acclaim; he developed a cult following and is widely considered the show's breakout character. Joel Keller of TV Squad called Ron \\"one of the more inspired sitcom characters of the last decade,\\" Zap2it writer Joel Keller called him one of the best sitcom characters since Cosmo Kramer of Seinfeld, and Geoff Berkshire of Variety said that the character would \\"go down in TV history as one of the all-time comedy greats.\\" Gabriel Perna of International Business Times wrote, \\"Offerman's Ron Swanson is one of the main reasons to watch Parks and Recreation. Considering how funny the show is and the scope of its cast, that says a lot.\\" Likewise, Gail Pennington, television critic with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, called Nick Offerman \\"the funniest guy on TV,\\" and TV Fanatic writer Eric Hochberger said, \\"There's certain character I watch this show for: Ron Swanson.\\" Jonah Weiner of Slate.com said Ron \\"has regularly stolen his scenes\\" and that Offerman has \\"a gift for understated physical comedy,\\" and Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said Offerman was not only funny, but capable of expressing a surprising range of emotions. During the second season, HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall called Ron \\"easily the show's best creation so far,\\" and during the third season he wrote, \\"Ron being both awesome and hilarious is something Nick Offerman and these writers can do in their sleep by now.\\" Sal Basile of UGO Networks wrote, \\"How anyone can make Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation likable is beyond us, but Offerman does it effortlessly. Before we knew it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron at the start of the show, and called him \\"a bit of the dud (who) offers little to the show, and almost just stand to sour the whole thing.\\" However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became \\"an absolute stand- out in the series.\\" Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The second-season episode \\"Ron and Tammy,\\" which predominantly featured Ron and his second ex-wife, is widely considered one of the best Parks and Recreation episodes. Offerman was particularly praised for his subtle minimalism and facial expressions, particularly the use of his eyebrows. Based on a line from \\"The Stakeout,\\" when Ron says, \\"I was born ready. I'm Ron fucking Swanson,\\" he is often referenced by fans and even reviewers as \\"Ron Fucking Swanson.\\" Fans created websites based on him like \\"Cats That Look Like Ron Swanson,\\" and after Ron misunderstood a turkey burger to be \\"a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger,\\" the cooking website Eater.com created and posted a recipe for that exact food. An image of a fake flavor of Ron Swanson-themed Ben & Jerry's ice cream, called \\"All of the Bacon & Eggs You Have,\\" was designed and circulated on the Internet. The Ben & Jerry's corporation responded positively to the image, and said in a statement, \\"Ron's beliefs are in accordance with those of Ben & Jerry's ‚Äì where two scoops of government can help the less fortunate and truly be a servant to the community and its citizens.\\" Paste ranked him No. 2 in its list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011, saying: \\"In four seasons, Ron has become the standout in a cast of incredible characters, and already seems poised to join the elite list of TV‚Äôs greatest comedic characters.\\" Awards In 2010, Nick Offerman received a Television Critics Association Award nomination for Individual Achievement in Comedy for his performance as Ron Swanson, although the award was ultimately given to Jane Lynch for her performance in the musical comedy-drama Glee. Also that year, Nick Offerman received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy from Entertainment Weekly's Ewwy Awards. Despite critical success, Offerman never received an Emmy Award nomination for this role. Several reviewers expressed particular surprise that he did not receive a nomination for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2011, which many considered the biggest snub of the season. Amy Poehler in particular was outraged by Offerman's snub, and said it was \\"a hot load of bullshit that [Offerman] didn't get nominated.\\" Multiple other actors, including Michelle Forbes and Ty Burrell (the latter of which received a nomination in, and eventually won, the category Offerman was competing in) stated that they believed Offerman should have been nominated, and Burrell added that Offerman deserved the nomination more than he.

Built in 1875-76, it is the oldest purpose- built synagogue building in the state. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. After being rescued from threatened demolition, it now houses a local cultural center. The congregation, established in 1843, is now located at a synagogue in West Hartford. Description and history The former Temple Beth Israel building is located south of downtown Hartford in the Sheldon-Charter Oak neighborhood. It is on the south side of Charter Oak Avenue, just east its junction with Main Street and west of Charter Oak Park. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure with a brownstone foundation and stone trim. It has a gabled roof, flanked at the front by towers with octagonal domed tops. Windows and entrances are set in round-arch openings in the Romanesque style. The synagogue was designed by George Keller and built in 1875-76 for a Jewish congregation established in 1843. It was in 1843 that the state, at the instigation of the congregation's leadership, passed a law making it possible for Jewish congregations to build synagogues. It is the only known High Victorian Romanesque work of Keller, who was one of Hartford's leading architects of the second half of the 20th century. The temple was used by that congregation until 1935, when it was sold to the Calvary Temple congregation, which occupied it until 1974. After standing vacant for some years, the city threatened to demolish it. Jewish groups around the state organized to preserve it, and it now houses the Charter Oak Cultural Center.

He is the son of Gough Whitlam (former Prime Minister) and Margaret Whitlam. Early life and education Whitlam was born in Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, and educated at Sydney Boys High School (1956‚Äì60) and the Australian National University in Canberra, where he graduated in law. Career=Early legal career Whitlam was called to the New South Wales bar in 1967. In 1973, he became South-east Asia regional counsel for Rank Xerox. Political career After several unsuccessful runs for preselection, Whitlam was elected in 1975 to the House of Representatives seat of Grayndler in central Sydney. His father Gough Whitlam was at that time the Leader of the Labor Party and had just been dismissed as Prime Minister by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. Labor was heavily defeated but Tony Whitlam easily won Grayndler. He became only the second federal MP to serve in the House at the same time as his father. He is also the only child of an Australian Prime Minister to be a federal MP (Kevin and Brendan Lyons, sons of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, were Tasmanian state MPs). In 1977, there was a redistribution of electoral boundaries in New South Wales, and the Division of Lang, adjoining Grayndler, was abolished. Whitlam ceded Labor preselection to the sitting Labor MP for Lang, Frank Stewart and stood for another seat, the marginal Liberal seat of St George, where he was defeated at the December 1977 election by the sitting Liberal member, Maurice Neil. He attempted a return to federal politics in 1979, but was defeated in a preselection battle for the seat of Grayndler.The Age, 14 May 1979, p. 5 During his time as a member of the Federal ALP Caucus he got to vote for his father as leader twice, the first in January 1976 the month after the 1975 election defeat and in May 1977 when Bill Hayden launched an unsuccessful challenge against Gough. He returned to the Sydney bar, where he had a successful career. Judicial appointments Whitlam was appointed a judge of the Federal Court of Australia in 1993. In 1995 he was also appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. Whitlam was one of only six politicians to have served in both the Parliament of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia, alongside Nigel Bowen, Robert Ellicott, Merv Everett, John Reeves and Duncan Kerr. After retiring from his judgeships, Whitlam returned again to the bar.

It resolved a number of territorial disputes between the Cook Islands and the United States. Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas, p. 595; Charney, Jonathan I. et al. (2005). International Maritime Boundaries, 5 vols, pp. 985‚Äì993. The treaty was signed in Rarotonga on 11 June 1980. The boundary is an equidistant line between the nearest islands of the two states. The boundary is 566 nautical miles long and consists of 24 maritime straight-line segments defined by 25 individual coordinate points. The north end of the boundary forms the tripoint with Tokelau and the south end of the boundary forms the tripoint with Niue. The treaty resolved a number of territorial disputes between the Cook Islands and the United States. First, the United States recognised the Cook Islands' sovereignty over the islands of Pukapuka, Manihiki, Rakahanga, and Penrhyn. Second, the United States implicitly demonstrated that it had abandoned its claim that Tokelau was part of American Samoa, since the boundary was set to terminate at its north end at a point at which a hypothetical equidistant boundary tripoint between the Cook Islands, American Samoa, and Tokelau would have existed. In December 1980, the United States confirmed the tripoint by agreeing to the Treaty of Tokehega with New Zealand, which formally established the Tokelau‚ÄìAmerican Samoa border. The full name of the treaty is Treaty between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary between the United States of America and the Cook Islands. The treaty was ratified by the United States and the Cook Islands in 1983 and came into force on 8 September 1983.  See also  *Guano Islands Act  Notes References * Anderson, Ewan W. (2003).

Its main facade is five bays, with a center entrance framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. The rear roof face extends to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox profile. The walls are plank-framed, and elements of the house's post and beam framing are exposed on the interior. Other surviving interior features include oak floors and builtin cabinetry. A wing extends to the main block's left. The oldest portion of the house, the front portion of the main block, dates to c. 1735, and was extended c. 1800 to give it the present saltbox configuration. It is one of Guilford's oldest and best-documented houses. Thomas Burgis, for whose like-named son it was built, was a remarkably successful cordwainer (shoemaker), who also operated a tannery.

Vern Barnett George Vern Barnett (31 January 189115 April 1946) was an Australian organist, choir master and accompanist. He was an important figure in the musical and cultural life of Sydney for many years in the early twentieth century. Early life and career Barnett, usually known as Vern, was born in Carlton, a suburb of Melbourne. He was the son of George Vern Barnett, a dental surgeon, and his wife Margaret Sophia (n√©e Woodward). The Barnetts lived in England and India before moving to Sydney in 1897.'Mr George Vern Barnett JP', Cyclopedia of New South Wales, Sydney, 1907, pp 671‚Äì672. Sheet music to 'War 1914' Barnett studied music under Edward Sykes and Edward Goll and became prominent on the Sydney musical scene as 'the boy wonder pianist'. Due to poor health he was rejected for service in World War I, but expressed his patriotism by writing a popular song entitled 'War 1914'. He was choir master and organist at Sydney churches including Petersham Congregational Church (1913‚Äì1919), St Andrew's Summer Hill (1919‚Äì1922), and St Peter's Neutral Bay (1922‚Äì1932) and gave performances on the Sydney Town Hall Grand Organ from the age of eighteen.'Art of the Accompanist', The Sun, 1921; 'Vern Barnett', Sunday Sun, 29 October 1924; 'Newcomer to 2BL', Wireless Weekly, 1926; 'Like Father, Like Son', Sunday Telegraph, 3 February 1929; 'War 1914' As an organist, Barnett was held in the highest regard. His expertise was such that he was often asked to advise on and test new and rebuilt organs throughout New South Wales. He was organist and choirmaster at the new St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Macquarie Street, Sydney, following its reconstruction in 1932. It was considered that he had one of the best libraries of organ music in Australia, which after his death was donated to the Organ Music Society of Sydney. Barnett was also celebrated as an accompanist. He worked with many great overseas and local artists including Andrew Black, Henri Verbrugghen, Florence Austral, Elsa Stralia, Lillian Nordica, John McCormack and Dame Nellie Melba. Melba was so impressed that she wanted him to go back to England as her permanent accompanist, but he preferred to stay in Australia. Newspaper reviewers frequently made special note of his contribution to performances with comments such as 'a great deal of the success of the performance was due to the fine work of G. Vern Barnett at the piano' and 'Mr G. Vern Barnett likewise did his part of the work with consummate taste and feeling, and gave the requisite help to the melodies without any attempt to secure undue prominence for himself, although his accomplishments in this capacity are undeniable'.'The Goflin Recital', The Theatre, 1 October 1923; 'A Great Adelaide Soprano', The Advertiser, 27 April 1925 In the 1920s Barnett embraced the new medium of radio, becoming the official pianist at radio station 2BL in 1925 and the station's musical director from 1927. In 1932, on the formation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), the station became part of their network, and Barnett also became leader of the Broadcasters Instrumental Trio and director of the Broadcasters Dinner Orchestra. He continued as musical adviser and performer after relinquishing the musical director post in 1936.'He Likes Classical Music: Vern Barnett's Song Cycles approved by listeners', Daily Guardian, 20 March 1928 Later years In 1932 under the auspices of the ABC, Barnett established the Sydney Radio Choir and remained its conductor for 6 years. This arose from the decision to perform on national radio Constant Lambert's choral work The Rio Grande. Within a week he succeeded in collecting some 80 singers, from whom 60 were selected. Under his baton the Sydney Radio Choir went on to give the first performances in Australia of works by composers such as Percy Grainger, Sir Granville Bantock, Gustav Holst and Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. Other successful performances of major works were Rossini's and Pergolesi's settings of the Stabat Mater, Gounod's Gallia, An Australian Symphony by Lindley Evans and the first performance of Alfred Hill's setting of the Third Psalm.'The ABC (Sydney) Radio Choir', National Programme, 25 September 1933 Barnett was deputy conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Society of Sydney from 1915 to 1926 and 1936 to 1939, and conductor from 1939 to 1946. He also prepared choirs for visiting conductors such as Sir Malcolm Sargent, Sir Hamilton Harty, and Sir Richard Runciman Terry. Sargent in particular expressed his appreciation and admiration for Barnett's preparation of a 250-voice choir in three weeks for a performance of Verdi's Requiem in 1936. The choristers were drawn from the Sydney Radio Choir, Conservatorium Select Choir, Royal Philharmonic Society, Sydney Male Choir and Hurlstone Park Choral Society. Sargent considered the choir 'very fine indeed', adding that 'I would be glad to have it at my disposal in any part of the world'.'Dr Sargent: Praise for Orchestra', Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1936; 'Dr Sargent ‚Äì \\"Jolly Good Fellow!\\"', Daily Telegraph, 2 October 1936 Throughout his career, Barnett was invited to adjudicate at vocal and choral competitions and Eisteddfods around Australia and New Zealand, including the prestigious The Sun Aria competition. He also taught piano and voice at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music for many years, and was at various times pianist of the Royal Apollo Club, organist and accompanist of the Welsh Choral Society, the Madrigal Society, and the Presbyterian Combined Choirs.'The Piano and Singing Adjudicator of the Wynnum Eisteddfod', Queensland Magazine, December 1924, p 12; 'Maryborough Eisteddfod', The Chronicle, 3 April 1926 Barnett married Doris Kathleen Trevor-Jones (n√©e Gartrell) on 20 October 1920. They had three children, Andrew, Brian and Judith, and lived in Chatswood on Sydney's North Shore. Barnett died suddenly on 15 April 1946 in Goulburn, New South Wales, where he had just completed adjudicating at the Goulburn Eisteddfod. His widow was also a pianist, music teacher and in her younger days a performer. She was the musical director of the Chatswood-Artarmon Music Club in the late 1940s and early 1950s. She died in 1987. Tribute Following his death at the age of 55 a memorial concert was organised by the Sydney musical community in Vern Barnett's honour in Sydney Town Hall. On that occasion one of many tributes came from Australia's first woman architect Florence Taylor CBE: 'He was the greatest contributor to life I have ever known.

Built about 1764, it is a well-preserved example of New England colonial architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The Guilford Keeping Society operates the house as the Thomas Griswold House Museum. The museum includes the late 18th century period New England saltbox house, a historic blacksmith shop, a barn with farm tools and implements, two corn cribs and a Victorian era three seat outhouse. The museum is open seasonally from June through October on a limited number of days each week. Description and history The Griswold House is located east of Guilford Center, on the south side of Boston Street (Connecticut Route 146) at its junction with Lovers Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, large central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. A leanto section to the rear gives the house a classic New England saltbox appearance. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the entrance. The entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a fully pedimented gable. The house was probably built around 1764 by Thomas Griswold III for one of his sons. It remained in the hands of his descendants until 1958, when it was acquired by the Guilford Keeping Society. The society undertook two major restorations, one in the 1970s and another in the 1990s. In addition to its use as a museum, it serves as the society's headquarters.

She is first seen as an apathetic college student working as an intern in the Pawnee Department of Parks and Recreation, before being hired as Ron Swanson's assistant. She later becomes the Deputy Director of Animal Control. April, along with Plaza's performance, garnered universal acclaim and has gained popularity for her goth-like behavior and deadpan-style comedy. Background April Ludgate is a college student who starts out working as an intern in the Pawnee parks and recreation department. She speaks in a blas√©, deadpan manner, and appears bored by everything and everyone. She lives with her parents, Larry (John Ellison Conlee) and Rita (Terri Hoyos), who, in direct contrast to their daughter, are warm and friendly. April is of English and Puerto Rican descent, which she says explains her \\"lively and colorful\\" personality, and is fluent in Spanish. She has a younger sister, Natalie (Minni Jo Mazzola), who is similarly bored and apathetic. Her family calls her \\"Zuzu\\". April is extremely uninterested in her job, regularly napping at her desk and texting constantly, and acts very dry and sarcastic around her co-workers. She was assigned the internship because she overslept on intern sign-up date, which she blamed on her sister Natalie for not waking her up. April was responsible for uploading the staff bios onto the Pawnee parks and recreation site, and she jokingly made a fictional bio for herself that reads as follows: While picking spirit dogs in season six, her coworker Donna Meagle (Retta) described her as follows: Character arc=Season 1 April starts as a 19-year-old intern at the parks department who is completely uninterested in her job and often annoyed by her fellow parks department workers. For the first two seasons, her boyfriend is Derek (Blake Lee), who is openly bisexual and who simultaneously dates an openly gay college student named Ben (Josh Duvendeck), whom April dislikes. (Aubrey Plaza herself came up with the idea of her character's boyfriend being bisexual and her boyfriend dating another man.) Season 2 Although still dating her openly bisexual boyfriend, Derek, who is still dating his boyfriend, Ben, April begins to develop a crush on Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), the ex-boyfriend of Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones). Andy is able to make April smile, which is something she rarely does. April flirts with Andy and even convinces Andy to let her give him hickeys on his neck in order to make Ann jealous, but Andy nevertheless remains unaware of her feelings toward him. In order to remain close to Andy, April volunteers to work as Ron's assistant, ending her time as an intern and establishing a full-time position at the Pawnee town hall. April finally breaks up with Derek after he makes fun of Andy and gives her a hard time about spending too much time with him. Toward the end of the season Andy and April's relationship begins to grow to the point that he begins to reciprocate her feelings but their age difference continues to be a wedge between them. They admit their mutual attraction to each other in the season finale, but she tells him she does not want to get involved with him because he still has feelings for Ann. She changes her mind after he gets into a car accident, and the two kiss for the first time, but she leaves abruptly after he reveals Ann kissed him just two minutes earlier. Season 3 April traveled to Venezuela between seasons but has returned to Pawnee to continue her job at the Parks Dept. and has a new Spanish-speaking Venezuelan boyfriend, Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). April eventually breaks up with Eduardo after he becomes friends with Andy because she was only using Eduardo to make Andy jealous. April tells Andy to do all of the things she hates doing for her for a month. After only one day of him doing this, April kisses Andy. Andy and April decide to get married in \\"April and Andy's Fancy Party\\" after only one month of dating. Andy had proposed to April the day before the party asking, \\"What if we got married tomorrow?\\" to which April replied, \\"Fine.\\" They were married at their dinner party (which was actually a surprise ceremony) in front of their friends and family. With a great deal of help from new housemate Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott), they have learned, to a limited extent, how to live and act like working adults. Season 4 April becomes a member of Leslie's campaign for City Council as the \\"youth outreach\\". April takes over a large portion of Leslie's duties in the Parks and Rec department towards the end of the season to allow Leslie to concentrate on the election. April is shown to somewhat enjoy and excel in this position. She also acquires a mentor in Parks Department Manager Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), a staunch Libertarian who likes her complete indifference to government work. In \\"Bus Tour\\", April becomes legally known as April Ludgate-Dwyer. Season 5 April is working as Ben's assistant in Washington D.C. as he successfully runs a congressional re-election campaign. She actively supports Andy while he tries to get into the Pawnee Police Department. Following her passion for animals, she develops plans to have Lot 48 become a dog park. She reveals that she wants to become a veterinarian and asks Ann to write her a recommendation letter. April becomes Deputy Director of the Animal Control after she suggests it be absorbed into the Parks Department due to its inefficiency. Season 6 At the beginning of Season 6, April is planning on attending Veterinary School; however, upon going to the orientation with Ann she realizes it is not what she wants to do. While she supports Andy for having a job away in London, she is very upset while he is away and misses him. She develops a closer relationship with Donna, and they both try to stop Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) from leaving the Parks Department by being unhelpful as he searches for a property for his restaurant. However, they later feel guilty, and help him find the perfect place. When Andy returns, she actively supports him on playing music for children, deciding to become his manager. While she pretends to be excited that her old nemesis Ann is leaving Pawnee, the pair share a nostalgic farewell at the Pawnee Commons site in \\"Ann and Chris\\". Along with Andy, Tom and some other Pawnee youths, she comes up with the idea of holding a Unity concert celebrating the merger. In the season finale, April has Leslie named a founder of the revamped city of Pawnee and motivates her to convince the National Park Service to move the Midwest Branch to Pawnee, which allows Leslie and Ben to stay. In addition, it is revealed that April and Andy are still happily married in 2017, with April working for Leslie. Season 7 It's 2017 and April laments, as time has passed and she has remained in her government career, she fears she and Andy are becoming ordinary and boring. While driving through the warehouse district, they spot a creepy old house with an equally creepy owner. He tells them it was a place for old factory workers who ended up going mad. They decide to purchase it. When local reporter Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) is honored by the mayor, April starts to feel that her life hasn't been fulfilled yet, and realises working in the Parks Department really isn't her dream job. In \\"Ms. Ludgate-Dwyer Goes to Washington\\", April is trying to find a way to tell Leslie that she wants to leave the Parks Department. When she finally tells Leslie, after a bit of reluctance, Leslie decides to help her. Leslie takes April to the American Service Foundation, which helps determine potential occupations for job- seekers. After April's meeting, April tells Leslie that she would like to work at the Foundation itself. April and Andy decide to relocate to Washington D.C. when April gets an offer to work for the Foundation. However, she feels guilty for making Andy give up 'the best job he's ever had' as children‚Äôs show host Johnny Karate. Andy assures her that she is the best thing that ever happened to him and after all the support she has given him, she deserves his support in her search for happiness. In a series of flash-forwards in the final episode, April and Andy ask Leslie and Ben for advice regarding the prospect of having children, which Andy very much wants but April does not. They ultimately decide to have children, and their son Jack (short for Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jack-o-Lantern) is born on Halloween 2023. By 2025 the couple is expecting their second child. Development The role of April Ludgate was written specifically for Aubrey Plaza. Upon meeting the actress, Parks and Recreation casting director Allison Jones contacted series co-creator Michael Schur and said, \\"I just met the weirdest girl I‚Äôve ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show.\\" Schur said he met with her and was taken so off-guard by her quiet and deadpan personality that he felt incredibly awkward and uncomfortable, spending the whole meeting trying to keep her entertained. Schur said that from that meeting on, he and fellow co-creator Greg Daniels knew they wanted to cast her on the show. When the scripts for Parks and Recreation were first written, the character was referred to simply as \\"Aubrey\\".

Originally meant to be a temporary character, Andy was so likable that producers asked Pratt back as a series regular. He appears in the first season as Ann Perkins' (Rashida Jones) unemployed, slacker boyfriend, then takes a job as a shoe-shiner at Pawnee City Hall in the second season. Andy eventually marries April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) and is later promoted to Leslie Knope's (Amy Poehler) assistant. Pratt was credited as a guest star for the first season, despite appearing in every episode; he is part of the main cast for every season after season one. Andy is one of the few starring characters not to appear in every episode, as he was absent for a multi-episode arc in season six while Pratt was filming Guardians of the Galaxy. He also did not appear in the season 2 episode \\"Practice Date.\\" Character overview Pratt summarized Andy Dwyer as \\"dim- witted and guileless and a real idiot, but lovable.\\" At the start of the series, Andy Dwyer is dating Ann Perkins. Ann matured faster than Andy did; while Ann entered into a career in nursing, Andy was lazy and unmotivated. After being dumped by Ann, Andy begins living in the pit adjacent to Ann's house. Andy remained unemployed after school but was the lead singer and guitarist for his rock band, which underwent numerous name changes (starting with \\"Teddy Bear Suicide\\" prior to the show's first season), including \\"MouseRat,\\" \\"God Hates Figs,\\" \\"Department of Homeland Obscurity,\\" \\"Flames For Flames,\\" \\"Muscle Confusion,\\" \\"Nothing Rhymes With Orange\\" (then, \\"Everything Rhymes With Orange\\"), \\"Punch Face Champions,\\" \\"Rad Wagon,\\" \\"Puppy Pendulum,\\" \\"Possum Pendulum,\\" \\"Penis Pendulum,\\" \\"Handrail Suicide,\\" \\"Angel Snack,\\" \\"Just The Tip,\\" \\"Jet-Black Pope,\\" \\"Four-Skin\\" (later \\"Three-Skin\\" when one member quit), \\"MouseRat\\" (again), \\"RatMouse\\" (without Dwyer), \\"Scarecrow Boat,\\" \\"Tackleshaft\\" and then \\"MouseRat\\" (yet again). Andy later gets work shining shoes at city hall, where he becomes friends with April Ludgate, whom he later marries after one month of dating. Though absentminded and possessing an extremely short attention span, Andy is shown to have a savant-like memory. For instance, he received the highest grade the police academy had ever seen on the written entrance test, has an uncanny ability to remember movies word for word, and is able to memorize a long list of facts for his feminist college class in the episode, \\"Smallest Park.\\" Andy also had perfect SAT scores, but mentioned it was probably due to broken Scantron machines. Andy also possesses a wild imagination, which helps him become a children's performer named Johnny Karate and then get his own children's television show. Occasionally, Andy goes into character as his alter ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin, whenever he and April role play or to solve local mysteries. Andy is a huge fan of the Indianapolis Colts and was married wearing Reggie Wayne's jersey. Storyline=Season one Before the start of the first season, a drunken Andy fell into a large construction pit and broke both his legs while attempting to retrieve a discarded toaster from the bottom of the pit. Ann is at first unaware that Andy was drunk at the time of the fall, and the incident inspires her to attend Parks and Recreation meetings to advocate for filling in the pit. It is at these meetings that Ann first befriends Parks Deputy Director Leslie Knope. With both of Andy's legs in casts, Ann pampers him, bringing him food and letting him play video games all day. When the doctors inform Andy that the casts can be removed, he delays their removal for several weeks so he can continue receiving this treatment from Ann. After the casts are removed, Ann discovers the truth and furiously breaks up with Andy. Season two Andy moves into a tent pitched in the pit and watches Ann, claiming to be protecting her. He makes many failed attempts to reconcile with Ann. After Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) begins dating Ann, Andy grows to hate him, but pretends to like him whenever Ann is around. Andy is injured in the pit a second time when Leslie arranges to have it filled with dirt, unaware that Andy is still in the pit. Andy considers suing the town with the hopes of getting money and winning Ann back, but Leslie convinces him to settle out of court in exchange for having the pit filled in. Leslie gives Andy a job as the shoe-shiner at the Pawnee City Hall as part of his settlement. April Ludgate, the parks department intern, begins to develop a crush on Andy, but he is for a long time unaware of her feelings toward him. As time goes on, Andy begins to develop feelings for April, though he is unsure about dating her due to their age difference and his own unresolved feelings for Ann. Simultaneously, Ann begins to show similar feelings for Andy. At the end of the season, having broken up with Mark, Ann kisses Andy, who does not reciprocate. This later causes him problems with April, who continues to believe he is still in love with Ann. Season three Andy has been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with April. When she finally returns from Venezuela, she arrives with a new boyfriend, Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). Leslie encourages Andy to not give up. In the episode \\"Time Capsule\\", Andy befriends Eduardo at the advice of Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe). As a result, April begins hating her new boyfriend, and he moves back to Venezuela. Andy also becomes the new coach of one of the two youth basketball teams, with Parks Director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) serving as the other coach. Andy's coaching style is much lazier than Ron's strict style. He is also briefly Ron's receptionist in \\"Flu Season\\". In the episode \\"Media Blitz\\", April leads Andy to believe that if he completes the tasks she hates every day for a month, she will consider being with him. In the same episode, it is hinted at that he has a cousin called Clara Dwyer. This, however, was never expanded upon further. Although she begins this as a bluff, after seeing Andy complete even the most humiliating of these tasks happily, she kisses him. In the episode \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" Andy reveals that he had proposed to April a day earlier after only one month of dating to which April replied, \\"Fine.\\" They are married at the end of the episode in a surprise ceremony. Season four At the beginning of season four, Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy to join his new company. He declines Tom's offer and instead joins Leslie's campaign as her assistant and head of security, a role he enjoys very much. At the end of the season, he is encouraged by April to pursue a career as a police officer as all his \\"dream jobs,\\" with the exception of rock star, revolve around law enforcement. Season five During the fifth season, Andy continues to pursue his ambition to become a police officer and seeks help from others to better his chances of passing the police academy entrance exams. He asks Chris to help him get fit enough to pass the police physical. His marriage to April is not strained by the distance between them: they exchange care packages and he visits her in Washington, DC. Andy earns a perfect score on the written portion of the police officers' exam. When he fails the personality portion of the exam, he gets a rousing pep talk from Chris. Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) then gives Andy a job working with him at the Sweetum's charity foundation. Season six Andy's role is reduced in the sixth season, as Chris Pratt was busy with filming commitments to Guardians of the Galaxy. Andy spends the early part of season 6 in England attending to Sweetum's charity work. Before he went to England, he loses 50 pounds after giving up beer (offered as an in-show explanation for Pratt's weight loss associated with his Guardians of the Galaxy role). He briefly visits Pawnee and does not want to return to England, but April convinces him to go back. Once he returns, he becomes part of a committee in the Parks department in charge of organising a concert to unite the recently merged towns of Pawnee and Eagleton. In the season finale, Andy reunites with MouseRat and sings a memorial song for 'Lil Sebastian, Pawnee's beloved, recently deceased mini- horse, at the Pawnee Unity concert. Season seven Andy remains married to April Ludgate, and the two have become responsible adults, to their horror. He has a TV show on public access, The Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show, where he is knighted by Lord Edgar Covington (Peter Serafinowicz) in its final episode, and later works part-time at the National Parks service. His friendship with Tom has grown since the previous seasons. After April decides to leave for a new job in Washington, D.C., Andy goes with her. In a series of flash-forwards in the final episode, April and Andy ask Leslie and Ben for advice regarding the prospect of having children, which Andy very much wants but April does not. They decide to try for it and their son, Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jack-o-Lantern \\"Jack\\" Dwyer, is born on Halloween 2023. By 2025 the couple is expecting their second child. Development and production Chris Pratt was credited as a guest star throughout the entire first season, but was promoted to the main cast in the second season. The Andy character was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character. As the focus of the series was supposed to be on local city government, the writers came up with ideas to keep Andy's character in the show after his breakup with Ann. He eventually gets a job at City Hall, first as a shoeshiner and then as Leslie Knope's assistant during her campaign, and later Ben Wyatt's assistant at the Newport Foundation. Showrunner Michael Schur said that during the second season, the writers had an idea that \\"if we stayed with him for a long time he was going to be this real Horatio Alger kind of guy - a guy pulling himself up, like a Charles Dickens character or something. At one time early on in Season 2, we were like, 'The end of the show is Andy is the mayor!' That was what we thought because he was going to shine people's shoes, and everyone was going to love him, and he was going to get to know everyone. That's why we kind of we kept we hung onto that for a long time. We had him be people's assistants, and it was like, 'Oh, he's meeting people,' and everyone who meets him loves him. At one point like in Season 2, Season 3, we were like, 'Andy is going to be the mayor someday,' and he was going to be this real like old-timey 19th century [scenario], like, 'He started as the shoeshine boy!'\\" Pratt purposely gained weight for the role during the first season, which he felt was right for the character of Andy Dwyer. \\"I'm not saying that fat is funny, but misplaced confidence is funny, and Andy is someone who is not fit but walks around like he is. So I went back the next day, and I told Mike Schur I wanted to gain 20 to 30 pounds. He said great.\\" However, the weight gain nearly prevented Pratt from getting film roles, first as baseball player Scott Hatteberg in Moneyball (2011) and then as Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). After crash dieting for Moneyball, he got into much better shape to play a Navy SEAL in Zero Dark Thirty; but subsequently regained the weight to resume portraying Andy. His weight loss for Guardians of the Galaxy was written into the script, when Andy claims he lost 50 lbs. in one month by giving up beer. Pratt took a hiatus from the show during the sixth season in order to film Guardians of the Galaxy. The sixth- season opener, \\"London,\\" partially took place in London in order to accommodate Pratt's filming schedule, as well as explain Andy's absence from Pawnee after he gets a temporary job offer in England. In the second season, Pratt did a scene with Amy Poehler and Rashida Jones in which Andy shows up at Ann's house totally naked. Pratt wore skin-tone briefs which were supposed to be pixelated for television to imply he was naked. After several takes of Poehler opening the door to see him naked, Pratt felt that Poehler did not seem convincingly surprised, so he took off the briefs. Poehler's reaction was so genuine that this was the take later aired on TV. However, Pratt was formally reprimanded for the prank in a letter from NBC. Although Pratt became a movie star by the end of the series, he said he never considered leaving the show.

For the duration of the commission, it was well covered by mass media. Its final 139 recommendations stimulated considerable discussion and controversy. Background In November 2005, an Australian teenager named Vanessa Anderson died at Royal North Shore Hospital following a golfing accident. Her death, widely reported in the media, led to long-running controversy and motivated government-level changes to public hospital policy. It was alleged that her death occurred due to inadequate care and a systemic hospital failure to recognize signs of a deteriorating patient. On 6 November 2005, while attending a school sporting event at a golf course, Vanessa Anderson was hit on the head by a golf ball. She was taken to Hornsby Hospital and subsequently transferred to the Royal North Shore Hospital. She was allegedly treated inappropriately for a fractured skull, and two days later, suffered a seizure and died. The coroner determined that Vanessa died from respiratory arrest due to the depressant effect of opiate medication.Coroner's finding: Inquest into the death of Vanessa Anderson. 24/1/2008 The incident, among others, led to a 2008 commission,NSW Health Media Release 25 January 2008 Peter Garling SC to lead Special Commission of Inquiry authored by Peter Garling, to investigate the standard of patient care in public hospitals, which found a \\"prevalent\\" problem associated with the care of the deteriorating patient. In 2010, the NSW Health Department conceded that Vanessa's death was unnecessary, tragic and avoidable, and that a new system of monitoring vital signs to detect deteriorating patients was needed statewide. This system includes red and yellow \\"Between the Flags\\" color-coded observation charts for recording a person's vital signs, allowing for easy visual recognition of deterioration. Observation charts have been developed for Adult, Pediatric, Maternity and Emergency patients. By 2012, every state hospital in New South Wales adopted the Between the Flags system, implementing Between the Flags Standard Observations Charts and a Clinical Emergency Response System (CERS) that details the process for calling for help and the clinicians required to attend. Medical officers, nurses, allied health practitioners (including physiotherapists) and other staff now undergo mandatory training to adhere to these standards. This manner of recording and acting upon variations in haemodynamics is now also taught to medical and nursing students in NSW.

It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the designation of the Madonna della Bruna and to Saint Eustace. Formerly the seat of the Bishops, later Archbishops, of Matera, it is now the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Matera- Irsina. History Matera Cathedral, panoramic view with the Sassi. The cathedral was built in Apulian Romanesque style in the 13th century on the ridge that forms the highest point of the city of Matera and divides the two Sassi, on the site of the ancient Church of Saint Eustace, protector of the city. Construction began in 1203, the year in which Pope Innocent III raised Matera to the rank of an archdiocese in union with Acerenza as the Archdiocese of Acerenza and Matera, and was completed in 1270. The original dedication was to Santa Maria di Matera, as recorded in a contemporary notarial document. Then, on the evidence of a will of 1318, it was entitled Santa Maria dell'Episcopio, and from 1389, the year in which Pope Urban VI (already Archbishop of Matera), instituted the feast of the Visitation, it was dedicated to Santa Maria della Bruna, also a protector of the city. Finally, from 1627 Monsignor Fabrizio Antinori, archbishop of Matera, dedicated the cathedral to the Madonna della Bruna and to Saint Eustace. Description The west front is dominated by the rose window of sixteen rays and by the campanile on the left side, 52 metres high. The cathedral has a Latin cross ground plan and contains three naves, separated by round arches supported by columns with stone capitals. Much of the interior received a Baroque-style decoration in the 17th and 18th century, including gilted stuccoes and frames. The interior houses a Byzantine-style fresco depicting the Madonna della Bruna and Child, dating from 1270 and attributed to one Rinaldo da Taranto; the relics of Saint John of Matera (translated here in 1830);La Citt√† del'Uomo.it: Life of San Giovanni di Matera carved wooden choir stalls (60 in total) in the apse (1453), by Giovanni Tantino of Nativity scene), sculpted by Altobello Persio; the Chapel of the Annunciation erected in Renaissance-style period by Giulio Persio; and a 14th-century fresco depicting the Last Judgment, which re-emerged during recent restoration work. The high altar has an altarpiece by Fabrizio Santafede depicting The Virgin with Saints.

Career After initially studying painting, Sugiura became an assistant to the manga artist Suih≈ç Tagawa. He soon began drawing his own manga in 1933 and came to fame after World War II with a series of comedic manga for children based on stories like those of Sasuke Sarutobi, Jiraiya, and Journey to the West. Sugiura closely followed popular culture and thus his manga were also influenced by such contemporary fads as Godzilla, pro wrestling, and American science fiction films. The philosophy of his manga \\"is of yukai, pleasure and amusement, pursuing the path as far from seriousness as possible. . . . The praxis of yukai is essentially the body in free motion, and Sugiura‚Äôs characters are defined by an excess of movement.\\"Gerow, Aaron (2006). \\"Wrestling with Godzilla: Manga Monsters, Puroresu and the National Body.\\" In Godzilla‚Äôs Footsteps. Eds. William Tsutsui and Michiko Ito. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Pp. 63-81. The result was a visual style that was often surreal and absurd. A craftsman, Sugiura could not keep up with the mass production of manga that the shift to weekly magazines brought at the end of the 1950s, and his subsequent manga became more and more surreal, if not avant-garde, as they came to be directed at an older audience. He enjoyed a second boom in popularity from the 1970s on. Influence Sugiura has influenced many artists in a variety of fields, including the gag manga artist Fujio Akatsuka.

Background and education  Peter Darbishire Orton was born in Plymouth, the son of marine scientist, J.H. Orton. He was educated at Oundle School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences, Music and History, receiving his degree in 1937. He then studied at the Royal College of Music, interrupted by wartime service in the Royal Artillery. On completing his studies, Orton obtained a position as a music teacher at Epsom College in Surrey.  Researches in mycology  P.D. Orton became interested in fungi through fellow amateur Arthur Anselm Pearson, who was also a keen musician. Specializing, like Pearson, in agarics, Orton developed considerable expertise in identifying species and in 1955 received a Nuffield Foundation grant to work with Dr R.W.G. Dennis, head of mycology at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and F.B. Hora at Reading University on a revised checklist of British agarics and boletes. The resulting New Checklist, published in 1960, was accompanied by 280 pages of descriptive and revisionary notes by Orton, including many new species. It remained the standard reference work for 45 years. In 1960 Orton took up a position at the newly opened Rannoch School in Perthshire, Scotland, where he taught biology, English, and music. He remained there till he retired in 1981. During this period, he published many papers on Scottish agarics, particularly those collected on his doorstep, in the Caledonian pine woods around Rannoch. He also contributed, with Prof. Roy Watling, to the British Fungus Flora series, published by the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. He frequently visited his friend and fellow mycologist T.J. Wallace in Membury, Devon, publishing a number of new agaric species from Dawlish Warren and other Devon localities. In 1986, he moved to Crewkerne, Somerset, where he continued to collect and publish on agarics, his last paper appearing in 1999.Marren, P. (2005) P.D. Orton: authority on British fungi.

Making his professional debut in 1989, he spent a total of 53 tournaments as an elite sekitori ranked wrestler, reaching a highest rank of maegashira 3 in 1998. After a number of injury problems he retired in 2005 at the age of 32. He is now a sumo coach under the name Hamakaze-oyakata. Career As a teenager he did judo and fencing. He was recruited by former yokozuna Wakanohana of the Magaki stable. He made his debut in November 1989 at the age of 16. After very briefly having shikona based on his own surname of Kojima, in 1990 he was given the name Wakasenry≈´, which was modified to Wakatenry≈´ in the following year. In January 1992 he reached the third highest makushita division, although he was able to score only two wins and five losses. He responded with his first ever y≈´sh≈ç, a perfect 7-0 record in sandanme, which earned him immediate promotion back to makushita. However, in 1993 he missed four successive tournaments, which saw him drop all the way down to the rank of jonidan 52. After another shikona change to Goj≈çr≈ç, he returned to the dohy≈ç in November 1993, winning 14 straight bouts and quick promotion back to makushita. In May 1995 a 6-1 performance at the rank of makushita 4 saw him promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time, alongside his stablemate, the Hawaiian born Yamato. He moved steadily up the division, and an 8-7 score at j≈´ry≈ç 1 in January 1997 was enough to see him promoted to the top makuuchi division in March. He dropped to j≈´ry≈ç after three tournaments but returned to makuuchi in January 1998 and a fine performance in May, when he recovered from 3-6 down to score 9-6, saw him promoted to his highest ever rank of maegashira 3 for the July 1998 basho. However, he was pitched against all the top ranked wrestlers for the first time, including three yokozuna and two ≈çzeki, and he finished with a 3-12 record. In 1999 Goj≈çr≈ç slipped back into the j≈´ry≈ç division, and he suffered a number of injury problems over the next couple of years. He went 4-4-7, 0-0-15, 7-7-1, 0-0-15 in the four tournaments from September 1999 to March 2000, but due to the k≈çsh≈ç seido (public injury) system he was able to stay in j≈´ry≈ç. However, yet another withdrawal in the September 2000 tournament on Day 5 saw him demoted back to makushita. It took him some time to recover from his injuries and return to the top ranks, but he collected two makushita y≈´sh≈ç on the way (both perfect 7-0 scores), and in September 2002 he finally returned to makuuchi after twenty tournaments away. He climbed to maegashira 4 in November 2002, and fought three ≈çzeki, but was unable to beat any and finished on 4-11. Gojoro's return to makuuchi was unfortunately short- lived, as yet more injury problems struck him in July 2003, when he was forced to pull out on Day 8 with only four wins and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç. Sitting out the September 2003 basho, he returned in November but had a disastrous tournament. Not only did he become the first wrestler in sumo history to suffer hansoku (disqualification) twice in one basho after he was judged to have pulled the topknot of Kokkai on Day 4 and Ushiomaru on Day 6, but he was injured again on Day 8 and had to pull out. He missed the January 2004 tournament as well, but the public injury system once again kept him at sekitori level. He was one of the last wrestlers to benefit from it as the system was abolished after this tournament. He struggled on in j≈´ry≈ç until May 2005, when on Day 7 he was injured during a bout with Kotokasuga that was declared too close to call. Unable to take part in the rematch, he lost by default and was unable to compete the next day as well. He thus became the first wrestler since Fujinoshin in September 1989 to lose by default two days in a row. He did return to the tournament, only to drop out again after his eighth loss on Day 12. Demoted to makushita once again, he fought only four more matches before finally announcing his retirement in November 2005. Retirement from sumo Staying in the sumo world as a coach at his stable, he was allowed to use his old fighting name as his toshiyori or elder name for a year, giving him time to acquire full stock. In November 2006 he switched to the Hamakaze name after it was vacated by the former Misugisato. Faced with a stable that was deteriorating due to the poor health of Magaki-oyakata, in November 2007 he transferred to another stable in the same ichimon, Sadogatake, and took up coaching duties there. Fighting style Goj≈çr≈ç used both yotsu-sumo (grappling) and oshi-sumo (pushing) techniques. He preferred a hidari-yotsu (right hand outside, left hand inside) grip on his opponent's mawashi, and often won by yorikiri or force out. However, his three most regularly used kimarite were oshidashi (push out), hatakikomi (slap down) and tsukidashi (thrust out).

It was established in January 2000 as an outcome of discussions among the elders of several tribes in the highlands of the region. The main goal of the assembly is to peacefully, democratically and legally work towards the recognition and protection of customary laws, values and beliefs of the Koteka peoples. Many activists from the organization who were involved in peaceful protests have been tortured and forced into exile. DeMMaK was in May 2000, prior to the Papuan People's Congress II (2000) held in Jayapura. The field leader of DeMMaK is Benny Wenda. Sam Karoba is the founder and international chair of DeMMaK. Though DeMMaK is generally supportive of the PDP, it accuses the latter of being too accommodating of the government. Koteka Tribes consists of seven major tribes in the central and southern highlands of West Papua; namely Lani, Mee, Amungme, Kamoro, Yali, Damal, and Moni with other sub-tribes such as Nggem, Walak, Hubla, Kimyal, Momuna, Ngalik. The above is the division of the Koteka Tribes according to foreigners. The people from the Koteka Tribes themselves classify the Koteka Tribes into four major tribes: Lani, Mee, Loma and Yali Tribes.

The convention was signed in Nuku'alofa on 11 January 1980. The text of the treaty is brief and states that the boundary will be an equidistant line between the Tongan and the French islands and that as soon as possible the parties will draw up cartographic maps that illustrate the border. When the border was actually drawn, Tongan sovereignty over Niuafo'ou was considered in drawing the equidistant line even though Niuafo'ou is hundreds of kilometres north of the rest of the islands of Tonga. As a result, the boundary is much closer to the islands of Wallis and Futuna than it is to the main islands of Tonga. The treaty came into force on the day of signature. The full name of the treaty is Convention between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga on the delimitation of economic zones. References *Jonathan I.

He is also the chairman of non-league club Walton Casuals. As a player, he made 636 appearances as a defender from 1977 until 1998, winning the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers in 1995. He also played for Fulham, West Ham United, Crystal Palace and Maidenhead United. Playing career= Fulham After progressing through the youth ranks of Fulham, Gale was promoted to the first team ahead of the 1977‚Äì78 season. Making his debut for the first team aged 16 in the Anglo-Scottish Cup against Orient, he was drafted in to the senior squad to replace World Cup winning Bobby Moore following his retirement from English football. Recording 38 league appearances and eight goals in his inaugural season, Gale cemented his place in the squad during their time in the Second Division. Suffering relegation to the Third Division after a 20th- placed finish during the 1979‚Äì80 season, Gale bounced back to the Second Division two years later. A dispute with manager Malcolm MacDonald saw Gale suspended shortly after the start of the season, but he returned to the first team set-up shortly after to make 44 league appearances as Fulham gained promotion back to the second tier. Gale narrowly missed out on promotion to the First Division during the 1982‚Äì83 season, with Fulham finishing in fourth place and a single point behind Leicester City. After a mid-table finish the following season, Gale opted for a move away from Craven Cottage in order to play in the First Division.  West Ham United  In July 1984, Gale completed a ¬£200,000 transfer to West Ham United, and went on to make 300 league appearances over a decade. Finishing 16th in his first season with the club, Gale was part of the side to finish third in the First Division in 1986 while forming a notable partnership with Alvin Martin. He spent all but one season in mid-table before West Ham's relegation to the Second Division following the 1988‚Äì89 season. When playing in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, Gale became the first-ever footballer in the English game to be shown a straight red card for denying an attacker a goal- scoring opportunity with a professional foul. After bringing down Gary Crosby in the 22nd minute, Gale's single career dismissal by Keith Hackett was deemed as unfair by West Ham fans as they suffered a 4‚Äì0 defeat to Forest and missed out on their chances of a first FA Cup final since 1980. It took the Hammers another 15 years before reaching the final once again. West Ham were promoted back to the First Division in 1991 at the second time of asking, but were relegated again after just one season back among the elite. In 1993, West Ham returned to the top tier of English football, now rebranded as the Premier League, and finished in 13th during Gale's final season with the club. In 1994 Gale was awarded a testimonial by West Ham. He received an estimated ¬£50,000 from the game, a 4‚Äì2 win at Upton Park against a Republic of Ireland team.  Blackburn Rovers  After his release from West Ham in 1994, Gale trained with Barnet before receiving a call from Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish. Joining on 11 August, he made his debut three days later in the 1994 Charity Shield, suffering a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Manchester United after goals from Eric Cantona and Paul Ince. Spending a single season at Ewood Park, Gale made 15 appearances in the club's 1994‚Äì95 Premier League winning campaign and clinched the only major honour of his playing career aged 35. Despite being asked by newly appointed manager Ray Harford to remain with the club for a second season, Gale opted against a coaching role while playing for the reserves. He later admitted it was a decision he regretted, after his only season playing outside of the London area.  Crystal Palace  After Blackburn's title triumph, Gale signed for relegated Crystal Palace. However, his time at Selhurst Park was plagued with injuries and he managed just two league appearances for the club halfway through that season, and retired from professional football at the end of it.  Maidenhead United  Gale then joined Maidenhead United in 1996, continuing his playing career at non-league level for two more seasons before finally retiring from playing in his 39th year. Media career Gale has been heard commentating on Premier League games for Premier League Productions, a venture of IMG Sports Media who produce, package and broadcast the live production of games for the Premier League for international broadcasters. For the 16/17 season he is part of the commentary team for Premier League games aired in the US on NBC. Gale has also contributed a regular column for West Ham's official website, WHUFC.com, along with a fortnightly column for Fulham's official website.  Personal life  Tony Gale joined Walton Casuals as Director of Football in 2002. During his time at West Ham, Gale was nicknamed 'Reggie' by his teammates. The name came from the comparison to Reggie Kray for his wicked sense of humour. He was also described by teammate Mark Ward as having the touch and vision of a centre forward. Gale is the chairman of Isthmian Division One South side Walton Casuals, having joined the club as Director of Football in 2003. He became chairman in 2011 and enjoyed two brief spells as caretaker manager. First taking over in March 2013 for eight games to see out the 2012‚Äì13 season, he also led the team for 12 games from September to November 2014. His son, Anthony, made over 200 appearances for the club and took over as manager in July 2015 after working alongside his father as caretaker manager in late 2014.

Early life and family history The last name \\"Tavernetti\\" is an Italian last name that points to the profession of an innkeeper or tavern owner, according to a family seal issued by the Swiss government. Thomas Tavernetti was born on December 23, 1889 on a ranch near Gonzales, California. His parents were Swiss immigrants from Moghegno, Switzerland. His father, Paul Tavernetti, was the son of Giovanni Battista Tavernetti, an unsuccessful \\"Forty-Niner\\" of the California Gold Rush. Paul was born in Moghegno in 1854 and immigrated to the U.S. in the 1880s. His wife, Giagonda Rianda, came to the U.S. about a year later. Thomas was the second of twelve children, two of whom died during birth. When he was young, Tom worked on the family farm in Salinas, California. Hunter Lane, as it was called, was also where the family home was. There was also a large ranch on Natividad Road which raised cattle. After schooling in Salinas, Thomas attended school at the University of California, Berkeley.  Profession  Thomas finished schooling at UC Berkeley in 1913, majoring in agriculture. After graduating, Thomas began working at the UC agriculture center in Davis, California. In Davis, Thomas assisted in the foundation of the UC Farm Station, which later became the University of California, Davis. He served as Assistant Dean of Agriculture from 1922-1934. In 1934, though, he died of pneumonia on his 45th birthday.  Remembrance: The Tavernetti Bell  There is a bell hung in his memory in the front of Aggie Stadium in Davis. After UC Davis football victories, the California Aggie Marching Band-uh! rings the bell once for every point scored during the game. The bell, referred to as the Tavernetti Bell (also known as the \\"Victory Bell\\"), was hung in his honor by UC Davis Alumni. With the construction of Aggie stadium, the bell followed from its previous location at the old site on Toomey field in 2007. The bell came from the Spreckels grade school that Tavernetti attended for his schooling. After its abandonment, the school's bell was taken to Davis where it is still used today. Thomas' son, Thomas Jr., was a World War II pilot who received many awards while serving his country. He shot down four enemy planes and was awarded the Flying Cross for his efforts. Tavernetti was the first of many in his family to be educated through the UC System. Four of his brothers attended UC Berkeley, three of whom took classes at the University Farm, which later became UC Davis. Thomas' nephew and surrogate son, Burton Anderson, also attended UC Berkeley. All three of Anderson's children attended UC Berkeley as well. One of his grandsons, too, recently graduated from the school, thus making Thomas the first of four generations at UC Berkeley. Three of Anderson's granddaughters attended UCLA. Another of Anderson's grandsons attended UC Davis as well. Anderson's son-in-law attended UC Davis.

The album is a single narrative-driven, long-form composition in five movements. The story and text were provided by a close, terminally-ill friend of the band, Yuko Sueta, in the final stage of her life, while the music was written by Toby Driver in a so-called \\"goth fusion\\" style, combining elements of early Cure, Faith and the Muse, and Bauhaus with further influences from Herbie Hancock's psychedelic jazz album Sextant and Scott Walker's recent experimental album The Drift. Sueta's story and lyrics were constructed with deliberate melodrama as part of the intended gothic aesthetic, expressing the protagonist's loneliness and longing to be in a better place, and her journey through her own personal looking-glass through a hallucinatory world of fear and wonder. Like Kayo Dot's previous album, Coyote was produced and engineered by Randall Dunn in Seattle, Washington. Story In April 2008, Toby Driver began working on a new long-form composition with Yuko Sueta, a NYC-based writer, filmmaker, and video artist. A first draft of the piece was premiered at The Stone in September 2008 by \\"The Kayo Dot Auxiliary Unit\\" (David Bodie and Daniel Means of Kayo Dot, Yuko Sueta, and Tim Byrnes on trumpet). Shortly thereafter, Sueta, who had been fighting breast cancer, became incapacitated by the disease. Driver then re-drafted and adapted the piece for Kayo Dot toured it in May 2009 on the road with Secret Chiefs 3, and recorded it with Randall Dunn in Seattle during June‚ÄìJuly 2009, releasing it later as 2010's Coyote. Sueta died while the record was in post- production, and the band dedicated it to her. After the positive reaction to the content performed on tour, Driver released Coyote in April 2010 on Hydra Head. On the album, the rotating lineup was made up of Driver on bass and vocals, Terran Olson on keyboards, David Bodie on drums, Mia Matsumiya on violin, Tim Byrnes on trumpet, and Daniel Means on woodwinds.

He played halfback for Ara Parseghian's championship teams at Miami University in 1954 and 1955 and led the undefeated, untied 1955 team in rushing, scoring, pass interceptions, kickoff returns and punt returns, while breaking the university's all-time single- season scoring record. He played one year of professional football in 1956 for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League. He was an assistant football coach at Central State University (1968), Miami University (1969) and the University of Michigan (1970-1991). He became a radio announcer for Michigan Wolverines football games on WUOM radio in 1994. Biography=Athlete at Miami University After three-and-a-half years of military service, Burton enrolled at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Miami's head football coach at the time, Ara Parseghian, recruited Burton to Miami. Parseghian recalled, \\"He had tremendous speed and we were anxious to have him. He could break the line. That's what every coach looks for.\\" Burton became a two-sport star at Miami, lettering three years each in both football and track from 1953 to 1955. As a halfback on Parseghian's football teams, Burton helped lead Miami to Mid-American Conference championships in both 1954 and 1955. The 1955 team compiled a perfect 9-0 record, and Burton led the team in rushing (722 yards in 82 carries), scoring (84 points), pass interceptions (4), kickoff returns (3 for 68 yards) and punt returns (14 for 216 yards). Burton's 84 points in 1955 (14 touchdowns in nine games) broke the school's single- season scoring record. His average of 7.2 yards per carry also set a new school record. At the conclusion of the 1955 season, Burton received more votes than any other player on the All-Mid-American Conference team. He was also selected by Associated Press for its second-team All-Midwestern team behind first-team selection Howard \\"Hopalong\\" Cassidy. Despite its undefeated, untied record, the 1955 Miami football team was not invited to a post-season bowl game, leading the university's president, John D. Millet, to state publicly that he believed \\"Southern 'social customs'\\" may have blocked a post- season football bowl bid. An anonymous university of official stated, \\"That's a roundabout way of saying we weren't chosen because we have colored boys on our squad.\\" Burton's career rushing total at Miami was 1,298 yards on 157 carries for an average of 8.3 yards per carry. His career scoring total at Miami was 151 points. In track, Burton won Mid-American Conference championships in the low hurdles three consecutive years and also placed in the high jump and 100-yard dash. As a senior, he placed second in the low hurdles at the national AAU meet and third at the national NCAA meet. Ottawa Rough Riders After graduating from Miami in 1956, Burton played one year of professional football for the Ottawa Rough Riders in the Canadian Football League. After a November 1956 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the Ottawa Citizen described Burton as one of Ottawa's stars: \\"Burton, one of Ottawa's stars, played a leading role in the 95-yard drive which brought the Riders their game-winning field goal. He took a long, 40-yard pass from Ledyard at center field and scurried like a scared rabbit to the Hamilton 27 before being nailed.\\" In his one season of professional football, Burton led the league with eight interceptions.According to CFL statistics published in the Ottawa Citizen on October 23, 1956, Burton was tied for the league lead with seven interceptions, and his 79 interception return yards were the most in league. See article published by Google News. According to cflapedia, Burton finished with eight interceptions which tied him with Ray Truant for the CFL lead. He scored four touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving), and had 155 rushing yards (29 carries for 5.34 yards per carry), 319 receiving yards (14 receptions for 22.79 yards per reception), and 175 kickoff return yards (11 returns for 15.91 yards per return). Coaching career After retiring as a player, Burton returned to Miami where he studied physical education and received a master's degree in education in 1962. Burton taught and coached for several years at Ach Junior High School in Cincinnati. He also coached football for five years at Withrow High School and Hughes High School, both in Cincinnati. Burton credited his college coach for inspiring him to be a coach: \\"Ara Parseghian was a great coach, ahead of his time as a teacher of all aspects of football. Because of him, I wanted to be a coach.\\" In June 1968, Burton was hired as an assistant football coach at the historically black Central State College in Wilberforce, Ohio. He was given responsibility for the offensive and defensive backfields. In January 1969, after Bill Mallory was hired as the head football coach at Miami, Burton was hired as an assistant coach at Miami. Mallory and Burton had been teammates at Miami. Mallory later recalled: \\"I'd known [Burton] back when we were students. I always had great respect for him. He was a darn good coach. I knew he'd be the kind of person I would want on my staff. I knew he would be a good teacher of the game.\\" Burton became the first African-American coach in any capacity at Miami. In June 1970, after one season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an assistant coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted. Despite his strong ties to Miami, Burton recalled that he could not pass on the opportunity to coach at Michigan: \\"I left Miami to coach at Michigan because of the challenge and an upward move in the profession.\\" Burton remained an assistant coach at Michigan for 22 years from 1970 to 1991. He began in 1970 as the coach of the freshman football team, coached receivers from 1972 to 1980 and then took over as the running backs coach from 1980 to 1992. Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: \\"Tirrel was everything to me. He was like my father and mother. He always was in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled.\\" Burton reported that coaching under Schembechler had been a huge honor: \\"Bo Schembechler was a great coach. He was from the same mold as Ara [Parseghian] ... Bo was demanding of his coaches and his players. I learned most of what I know about football from Bo.\\" Burton retired from the Michigan coaching staff in May 1992. Later years and honors After retiring as a coach, Burton remained employed by the University of Michigan as an assistant director of licensing for the athletic department. In 1994, Burton was teamed with Tom Hemingway, who had been announcing University of Michigan football games since 1963, as the radio announcers for Michigan Wolverines football games on WUOM radio. Burton was inducted into the Miami University Hall of Fame in 1974. He died on January 17, 2017 at the age of 87.

The initial roster of the league was intended to include teams from twelve cities in the southern U.S. Lewis, who was interviewed by Scott Michaux of the Augusta Chronicle, said that one of the objectives of the AABA was restoring \\"court sanity\\" to the game of basketball. Plans Lewis claimed that local contacts in each of the twelve targeted cities, including Augusta, Georgia; Albany, Georgia; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, would pay $10,000 to become \\"licensees\\" of the league. Lewis also hinted at a possible reality television show, Snow Ball vs. Bro Ball, involving the league. There is no evidence that Lewis ever followed through on any of these plans. Initial reception One of the cities intended to be a part of the AABA was Augusta, Georgia. Augusta's mayor, Deke Copenhaver, stated that he did not support the idea: \\"As a sports enthusiast, I have always supported bringing more sporting activities to Augusta. However, in this instance I could not support in good conscience bringing in a team that did not fit with the spirit of inclusiveness that I, along with many others, have worked so hard to foster in our city.\\" Clint Bryant, athletic director at Augusta State University, described the idea for the league as \\"absurd\\", and noted that it \\"gives you an idea of the sickness of our society.\\" Dip Metress, head men's basketball director at ASU, also opposed the idea, saying \\"nobody is going to put money behind this. Basketball is an international game.\\" Chattanooga, Tennessee was another city targeted by Lewis' plan; a spokesman for Chattanooga Mayor Ron Littlefield described Lewis' plan as \\"absolutely ridiculous\\", but also added that he was unaware of anything the City could do to actually stop it. Critics commented on the irony of a whites-only basketball league being announced on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; former NBA star Charles Barkley called the idea of the AABA \\"blatantly racist.\\" Don Lewis, the founder of the AABA and formerly a Georgia-based boxing and wrestling promoter, responded by saying that he did not \\"hate anyone of color\\" but that he felt that white people should be given their own league to play \\"fundamental basketball, which they like\\" instead of the \\"street ball\\" he said is played by nonwhites. He claimed that \\"white basketball players are essentially 'shut out' of conventional professional basketball due to the proliferation of non-organized play on the court\\" and cited Gilbert Arenas' suspension for bringing guns into the Washington Wizards' locker room as an example of the way basketball was being run, commenting \\"That's the culture today, and in a free country we should have the right to move ourselves in a better direction.\\" Lewis claimed to have received threats from people opposed to the AABA's whites-only policy. Besides Augusta, several other cities warned Lewis and the AABA to \\"stay out of town\\". Because of the negative attention toward the league, Don Lewis' nephew Ralph said that the physical address of its Atlanta, Georgia office would not be made public. Reverend R. L. White, president of the Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the AABA as \\"ridiculous\\" and said \\"it attempts to set back what we've been trying to do for 100 years.\\" White said he was worried that the all-white basketball league might set off racial tensions, and added, \\"If we can do anything to stop it, we will.\\" The Daily Show did a feature on the AABA on March 29, 2010 interviewing Don Lewis, using the show's satirical approach in covering the topic.

Earle, and was nearly doubled in size in 1930 with the addition of the Fanning Annex, designed by the Norwich firm of Cudworth & Thompson, and funded by a bequest from local businessman David Hale Fanning. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

The museum's displays illustrate life in New England during the 18th and 19th centuries, and are themed around a farmer's workshop, a kitchen, school and children's playthings. The museum is open on the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of each month in the afternoon. Architecture The library is a 1-1/2 story structure, built out of granite with brownstone trim, all finished with a rough quarry exterior. It is roughly rectangular in shape, with a projecting tower at the front right, and a hip roof from which hipped dormers project. The 1930 addition nearly doubles the size of the original building, and creates an L shape at the rear; it is built using similar materials. Most windows are set in rounded-arch openings with brownstone framing, with a brownstone stringcourse at the base of the arched section.

The treaty was signed in Suva on 19 January 1983. The text of the treaty is brief and states that the boundaries will be set by the principle of setting an equidistant line between the territories. The boundary with New Caledonia is to the southwest of Fiji and consists of one maritime straight-line segment defined by two specific points. For purposes of drawing the border, the treaty assumes that France has sovereignty over Matthew and Hunter Islands, but since Vanuatu also claims sovereignty over the islands, the treaty states that the treaty is \\"without prejudice to the sovereign rights of any neighbouring State\\". The boundary with Wallis and Futuna is to the northeast of Fiji and consists of four straight-line segments, defined by five individual coordinate points. The agreement came into force on 21 August 1984, after both states had ratified it. The Fiji ‚Äì Wallis and Futuna boundary was adjusted slightly by a 1990 codicil to the treaty.

The district extends along Leonard Court, New Shore Road, and Shore Road, and includes properties directly abutting the Sound as well as those with views of it that are on higher ground. The area was developed beginning in 1891 by Henry Cooke White, whose summer estate is located on White Point. The area includes a number of large high-quality Shingle style residences, and includes the work of architects Wilson Eyre and Briton Martin. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Hartford Colony is located in the central portion of Waterford's southern coastline. It is set on the southwest side of a lobe of land that forms the east side of Jordan Cove, and includes the south-facing Magonk Point (the district's southern and eastern limit) and southwest-facing White Point, and is roughly bounded on the north by Pleasure Beach and Lindros Lane. A significant number of the properties in the district have shore frontage, and are accessed via either New Shore Road or Shore Road. Other properties in the district also front on those roads. The southern portion of the district is characterized by large lots with multi- building estates, while the northern section includes an area of densely built houses close to the road. The colony was the development brainchild of Henry C. White, an artist born into a wealthy Hartford family who first saw the area on a summer trip in 1891. He purchased land at what is now called White Point, and had a Shingle-style mansion built there to a design by Wilson Eyre, a prominent Philadelphia architect. The area then attracted a number of high- profile members of Hartford's business and cultural upper crust, including Mary Batterson Beach, the daughter of James Batterson, founder of the Travelers Insurance Company. The Beach estate, also in the Shingle style, overlooks Magonk Point. William Putnam, a friend of White, purchased land for more speculative development at the northern end of the district.

It was designed by Robert Mills, one of the country's first formally trained architects. From 1839-40, the schooner La Amistad, on which captured Africans meant for the slave trade rebelled, was impounded at a wharf behind the customhouse. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture in 1970, and is now a local museum covering the city's maritime history. Description and history The New London Custom House is located on New London's waterfront, facing north onto Bank Street east of its junction with Pearl Street. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of dressed granite of differing colors. Due to sloping terrain, it presents two stories to Bank Street and three to Water Street, which separates it from the waterfront. It has corner pilasters shaped out of light granite, and its main entrance is sheltered by a porch with round columns and pilasters made of more smoothly finished light granite. A stringcourse of light granite separates the upper floors, and the top-floor windows have projecting cornices over the lintels. The door is fashioned out of wood that was once used in the USS Constitution. The custom house was built in 1833 to a design by Robert Mills, who was then employed by the federal government. The granite for its construction was taken from the Millstone Quarry in Waterford, Connecticut. The building was still in use as a customs office at the time of its National Register listing in 1970. It now serves as the headquarters of the New London Maritime Society, which operates it as the Custom House Maritime Museum. Exhibits include New London's maritime history, ship models, the Amistad affair, the history of the Robert Mills building, and regional lighthouses. The Frank L. McGuire Maritime Library consists of more than 2,300 books, charts, maps, and prints. The Society also owns the nearby New London Harbor Light, the offshore Race Rock Light, and New London Ledge Light, and it operates tours of all three.http://www.nlmaritimesociety.org/2015SummerActivities.html See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ReferencesExternal links * Custom House Maritime Museum - official site Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Government buildings completed in 1835 Category:Buildings and structures in New London, Connecticut Category:Museums in New London County, Connecticut Category:Maritime museums in Connecticut Category:Custom houses in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:Custom houses on the National Register of Historic Places ","title":"New London Customhouse"},{"id":"25886832","text":"Gonga Chilonir Pakhi (, English: Feathers of the tern) is an Assamese language film by Padum Barua released in 1976.

The facility includes a rare surviving partial example of a large-scale dam built for a textile mill in 1865, and an early example of a hydroelectric power generation facility established in 1934. It is one of a small number of surviving hydroelectric plants in the state which was built before 1940. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Occum Hydroelectric Plant and Dam is located on the Shetucket River in northern Norwich and southern Sprague, just north of the Bridge Street bridge. The facilities include a dam, an intake structure on its western (Norwich) end, and a small brick powerhouse just below the intakes. The dam is a combination of granite and concrete construction, standing 14 feet high, and impounds a maximum of 600 acre-feet of water. The older portions of the dam are formed out of large granite blocks, now largely covered in gravel on the upstream side. About of the original 1865 dam survive (out of an original ), and the dam is now long, the balance a concrete extension built in the wake of flooding attending the New England Hurricane of 1938. The headgates and intake structures are, like the dam, a combination of older and newer components. The brick powerhouse was built in 1934. The dam was built in 1865 as part of a plan to provide water power to downstream textile mills. It originally had intake structures on both the Norwich and Sprague sides, and provided power to mills on both sides of the river. A mill operated on the Norwich (Occum) side of the river until 1980. The city of Norwich acquired the dam and water rights in 1934, converting it to hydroelectric generation at that time. After the dam was extensively damaged in the 1938 floods, its eastern end was rebuilt in concrete. The power station is a late example of early hydroelectric power stations, and is one of the only ones of that age left in the state.

The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The River Road Stone Arch Railroad Bridge is located in a rural setting of northwestern Colchester, within Salmon River State Forest. River Road is a gravel road paralleling the Blackledge River, between the river and the railroad right of way. When the river and road bend to the northwest, the railroad line crosses both, the road on this bridge, and the river on the Blackledge River Railroad Bridge. This bridge is a round-arch masonry structure, made out of mortared ashlar brownstone. The arch has a span at its base of and is high. The sidewalls of the bridge rise above the former height of the tracks, and all four corners of the bridge have wing walls that extend the structure to retain part of the embankment carrying the right of way. The Air Line Railway was developed in the 1870s, as a more straight-line connection between New Haven, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts, via Middletown. Originally this was a grade crossing, but increasing train speeds prompted the state to mandate railroads operating in it to reduce the number of such crossings. This bridge was built in 1887, and was apparently one of several similar bridges. Its arch voussoirs are individually numbered, suggesting that they were cut at a central location and shipped to the site.

Sources Two books, the Bobbio and the Stowe Missals, contain the Irish Ordinary of a daily Mass in its late Romanized form. Many of the variables are in the Bobbio book, and portions of some Masses are in the Carlsruhe and Piacenza fragments. A little, also, may be gleaned from the St. Gall fragments, the Bangor Antiphonary, and the order for the Communion of the Sick in the Books of Dimma, Mulling, and Deer. The tract in Irish at the end of the Stowe Missal and its variant in the Leabhar Breac add something more to our knowledge. The Stowe Missal gives us three somewhat differing forms, the original of the ninth century, in so far as it has not been erased, the correction by Moelcaich, and, as far as it goes, the Mass described in the Irish tract. From its size and contents it would seem to be a sort of Missale Itinerantium, with an Ordinary that might serve for most any occasion, a general Common of Saints and two Masses for special intentions (for penitents and for the dead). The addition of the Order of Baptism, not, as in the Bobbio book or in the \\"Missale Gothicum\\" ad Missale Gallicanum, as part of the Easter Eve services, but as a separate thing, and the Visitation of the Sick, points to its being intended to be a convenient portable minimum for a priest. The pieces said by the people are in several cases only indicated by beginnings and endings. The Bobbio book, on the other hand, is a complete Missal, also for a priest only, of larger size with Masses for the Holy Days through the year. The original Stowe Mass approaches nearer to that of Bobbio than the revised form does. The result of Moelcaich's version is to produce something more than a Gelasian Canon inserted into a non-Roman Mass. It has become a mixed Mass, Gelasian, Roman, or Romano-Ambrosian for the most part, with much of a Hispano-Gallican type underlying it, and perhaps with some indigenous details. It may be taken to represent the latest type of Irish Mass of which we have any information. The title of the Bobbio daily Mass is Missa Romensis cottidiana, and the same title occurs before the Collect Deus qui culpa offenderis at the very end of the Missale Gothicum. This collect, which is in the Gregorian Sacramentary, occurs in both the Bobbio and the Stowe, and in the latter has before it the title, Orationes et preces missae aecclesiae romane, so that it is evident that the Roman additions or substitutions were recognised as such. Liturgy The Order of the daily Mass, founded on that in the Stowe Missal is as follows. *Praeparatio Sacerdotis. Confession of sins, beginning \\"Peccavimus, Domine, peccavimus\\". This and the Litany which follows are found also in the St. Gall fragments, but not in the Bobbio book. *Litany of the Saints. In the original hand there are only thirteen invocations (Our Lady, ten Apostles, St. Mark, and St. Luke). Moelcaich added thirty-one more, of which twenty-four are Irish. The manuscript is wrongly bound, so that these additions look as if they were associated with the dyptychs in the Canon. *Oratio. The \\"Oratio Augustini\\" (\\"Rogo te Deus Sabaoth\\") is found in various ninth- and tenth-century French books (see Warren's \\"Celtic Church\\"). The Oratio Ambrosi (\\"Ante conspectum divinae majestatis\\") is inserted by Moelcaich and found in several French books. *Collect. \\"Ascendat oratio nostra\\". This occurs after the Creed and Paternoster in the \\"Liber Hymnorum\\". From the Irish tracts it seems that the chalice was prepared before the Introit, a very usual practice in both East and West in early times. It is still the Eastern practice, and is retained to this day by the Dominicans at low mass and in the Mozarabic Rite.Dr. Legg's Ecclesiological Essays, pp. 91‚Äì178 Water was poured in first with the words \\"Peto (Leabhar Breac, Quaeso) te, Pater, deprecor te, Fili, obsecro te, Spiritus Sancte\\". The Leabhar Breac directs that a drop shall be poured at naming each person of the trinity. The wine was similarly poured on the water, with the words, \\"Reditit pater, indulget Filius, miseretur Spiritus Sanctus.\\" The Introit is mentioned in the Irish tracts but not given in the ordinary or elsewhere in either missal. Probably it was sung from a psalter. The collect The Collect, in the Stowe and Bobbio Ordinaries is Deus qui de beato Petro, the collect for St. Peter's Day, \\"iii Kal Julias\\" in the Gelasian Sacramentary. In the Stowe a corrector, not Moelcaich, has prefixed \\"in solemnitatibus Petri et Christi\\" [sic]. Imnus angelicus, i.e. Gloria in excelsis. Begun in the original hand, continued by Moel Caich on an inserted slip. This comes after the conclusion of the Missa Romensis cottidiana in the Bobbio book and is preceded by a prayer \\"post Alos,\\" which probably means the Trisagion (Hagios o Theos, k.t.l.), or the Greek of the Sanctus, as used elsewhere in the Mozarabic, one or other of which may have come at this point, as it did (according to St. Germanus of Paris) in the Gallican Rite. This in the last was followed by Kyrie eleison and Benedictus, the latter being called \\"Prophetia\\". There are collects styled \\"post Prophetiam\\" in the Bobbio Missal at the beginnings of several Masses. After the Gloria in the Bobbio there is a collect post Benedictionem (after the Benedicite). This was said in the Gallican, as part is still said in the Mozarabic, after the Epistle. The collects post Precem, according to Mabillon, mean the same, but that seems improbable, and this name may possibly refer to the prayers after the Bidding Prayer Litany, which has been known as \\"Prex\\". *Collect, \\"Deus qui diligentibus te\\", given as a Sunday collect in the Gelasian. It is written by Moel Caich over erased matter (probably the original continuation of \\"Gloria in excelsis\\"), and another hand has prefixed a direction for its use. \\"in cotidianis diebus\\", instead of that which follows. *Collect \\"Deus qui culpa offenderis\\". In the original hand with inserted heading already mentioned, and \\"haec oratio prima Petri\\". It follows the St. Peter collect in the Bobbio Ordinary. A Hic augmentum, inserted by Moel Caich, probably means additional proper collects. It is mentioned in the Irish tract as tormach (increase, expansion) coming before the Lesson of the Apostle. Later, at the Offertory, one finds secunda pars augmenti hic super oblata. St. Columbanus uses the word, in the sense of \\"addition\\", with reference to petitions added to the psalms at the day hours, cum versiculorum augmento intervenientium. The epistle The Epistle, in the Stowe daily Mass, is I Cor., xi, 26‚Äì52. On certain days the Bobbio had a lesson from the Old Testament or Apocalypse before the Epistle. The Gradual The Gradual ‚Äì the tract calls it \\"salm digrad\\". If this includes everything between the epistle and gospel, the construction is: #Prayer Deus qui nos regendo conservas, added, not by Moel Caich. Found in the later Gelasian manuscripts. #Prayer, Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui populum tuum. An Easter collect in the Bobbio Missal, given also by Gerbert as Ambrosian. #Psalm civ, vv. 4, 1‚Äì3, 4. #Prayer Grata sint tibi Domine. The secreta of an Advent Mass in the Gelasian. #Alleluia. Ps. cxvii, 14. #Prayer Sacrificiis praesentibus, Domine. The \\"secreta of another Advent Mass in the Gelasian. #Deprecatio Sancti Martini pro populo. The title was added by Moel Caich.) This is a Bidding Prayer Litany or Prex resembling very closely the Great Synapte of the Greek Rite and the litany used on the first four Sundays of Lent instead of Gloria in excelsis in the Ambrosian. #Prayer Sacrificium tibi, Domine. The secreta of another Advent Mass in the Gelasian. Perhaps it is here an \\"Oratio post Precem\\" of the Gallican type. #Prayer Ante oculos tuos, Domine. It occurs in the same place in the Mass published by M. Flaccus Illyricus (Mart√®ne, I, 182). #Lethdirech sund. A half uncovering of the chalice and paten here. This is referred to in the tract as indinochtad corrici leth inna oblae agus incailich (the uncovering as far as half the oblation and chalice), and is associated there with the singing of the Gospel and All√≥ir. Earlier it is mentioned as following the Gradual. #Psalm cxl, 2, sung thrice. #Hic elivatur lintiamen calicis. Dr. Legg (Ecclesiological Essays, p. 133) mentions that this lifting of the veil was the practice in England just before the Reformation and in the Dioceses of Coutances and St.-Pol-de-Leon much later. #Prayer Veni Domine sanctificator. Nearly the {\\"Veni sanctificator\\" of the present Roman Offertory. 1 to 8 are in the original hand, part of 9 is inserted by Moel Caich, possibly over erasures, the rest is written by Moel Caich on added leaves. The psalm verses are only indicated by their beginnings and endings. Perhaps the prayers were said and the ceremonies with the chalice veil were performed by the priest while the congregation sang the psalms and Alleluia. Nothing of all this is in the Bobbio. Possibly, judging from the collect Post Benedictionem, which is the collect which follows the Benedictus es (Dan., iii) on Ember Saturdays in the Roman missal, either the Benedicite or this Benedictus came between the Epistle and Gospel, as in the Gallican of St. Germain's description. The Gospel and Creed Gospel reading. In the Stowe Mass, this is St. John vi, 51‚Äì57. This begins in Moel Caich's hand on an inserted sheet and ends in the original hand. The tracts say that the Gospel was followed by the \\"Alloir\\", which Dr. Stokes translates \\"Alleluia\\", but Macgregor takes to mean \\"blessing\\" and compares with the Per evangelica dicta, etc., of the Roman rite. An Oratio Gregorii super evangelium is included, on an inserted slip in Moel Caich's hand. In the Gregorian Sacramentary on the second Saturday and third Sunday of Lent, but not in connection with the Gospel. The Creed is in the original hand, with the \\"Filioque\\" inserted between the lines, possibly by Moel Caich. Offertory The order of the offertory in the Stowe Missal is: #Landirech sund (a full uncovering here). In Moel Caich's hand. #Ostende nobis, Domine, misericordiam, etc. thrice. #Oblata, Domine, munera sanctifica, nosque a peccatorum nostrorum maculis emunda. This is in the Bobbio Missal (where it is called \\"post nomina\\") and in the Gelasian and Gregorian. It is the secreta of the third mass of Christmas Day in the Roman missals until 1962. According to the tract, the chalice was elevated while this was sung, after the full uncovering. The Leabhar Breac says that it was elevated quando cantitur Imola Deo sacrificum laudis. #Prayer Hostias quaesumus, Domine. This occurs in one set of \\"Orationes et preces divinae\\" in the Leonine Sacramentary. It is written here by Moel Caich over an erasure which begins with \\"G\\", probably, as Warner conjectures, the prayer \\"Grata sit tibi\\", which follows \\"Oblata, Domine\\" in the Bobbio Missal. In Moelcaich's correction this in an amplified form occurs later. #Prayer Has oblationes et sincera labamina. In Moel Caich's hand. This prayer, which includes an intercession pro animabus carorum nostrorum N. et cararum nostrarum quorum nomina recitamus, is evidently a relic of the former reading of the dyptychs at this point, as in the Hispano- Gallican liturgies. It and the next prayer in its Stowe form, as Warren points out, resemble Gallican or Mozarabic \\"Orationes post nomina\\". #Secunda pars augmenti hic super oblata. Probably refers to additional proper prayers, analogous to the Roman secreta (see 7, supra). #Prayer Grata sit tibi haec oblatio. An expanded form of the prayer which followed Oblata in the original writing. A long passage referring to the diptychs is inserted. Most of this prayer is on the first page of an inserted quire of four leaves in Moel Caich's hand. In the Bobbio, only Oblata and Grata sit tibi are given at the Offertory, one being called Post nomina, the other Ad Pacem. Perhaps the Pax came here in the seventh century, as in the Gallican and Mozarabic. #The \\"Sursum Corda\\", not preceded by \\"Dominus vobiscum\\". The Preface, unlike the Bobbio daily Preface, which, like that of the Roman Missal, goes straight from per Christum Dominum nostrum to per quem, inserts a long passage, reminding one, at the beginning and near the end, of the Trinity and Sunday Preface of the Roman Missal but otherwise being unique. At the end is a direction in Irish to the effect that here the \\"dignum of the addition\\" (dignum in tormaig), i.e. the Proper Preface, comes in, if it ends with per quem. There is then a similar direction if the \\"addition ends with Sanctus\\". The Sanctus, with a Post-Sanctus, resembles that in the Mozarabic missal for Christmas day and that for Christmas eve in the Missale Gothicum. There is also a Post- Sanctus in the first of the three masses given in the Stowe. It is followed by Qui pridie, as though the Gelasian Canon were not used in that case. The follows a Canon dominicus papae Gilasi, the Gelasian Canon (as given in H.A. Wilson's edition) with certain variations, the most noticeable of which are: #Te igitur adds, after papa nostro, episcopo sedis apostolicae, and after fidei cultoribus\\" et abbate nostro n. episcopl. Sedis apostolicae is added also in the Bobbio. #A direction follows, Hic recitantur nomina vivorum. #Memente etiam domine, contains a long list of intercessions for various classes of persons. This is also found in Carlsruhe Fragment B, but not in the Bobbio. #\\"Communicantes\\". Variants for Christmas, Circumcision (called Kalendis), Stellae (that is Epiphany ‚Äì compare Welsh, Dydd Gwyl Ystwyll; Cornish, Degl Stul; and in stilla domini in the St Cuthbert Gospels. The actual variant here is natalis calicis (Maundy Thursday), the end of one and the beginning of the other have been dropped out in copying, Easter, Clausula pasca (Low Sunday), Ascension, and Pentecost. The inserted quire ends with the second of these, and the others are on a whole palimpsest page and part of another. The original hand, now partly erased, begins with part of the first clause of the Canon, tuum dominum nostrum supplices te rogamus, and contained all but the first line of the Te igitur and Memento clauses, without the long intercessory passage, the nomina vivorum direction, or the variants. #The original hand begins, Et memoriam venerantes, continuing as in the present Roman Canon without variation until the next clause. The Bobbio Canon includes saints Hilary, Martin, Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory, Jerome, and Benedict. #Hanc igitur oblationem contains an interpolation referring to a church quam famulus tuus. . .aedificavit, and praying that the founder may be converted from idols. There are many variables of the Hanc igitur in the Gelasian. In the daily Mass the Bobbio inserts quam tibi offerimus in honorem nominis tui Deus after cunctae familiae tuae, but otherwise is the ordinary Gelasian and Gregorian. #In Quam oblationem and Qui pridie there are only a few variations; egit for agens, acepit (calicem) for accipiens (as also in the Bobbio book), and calix sancti sanguinis mei (sancti is erased in the Bobbio), until the end, when Moel Caich has added the Ambrosian phrase passionem meam predicabitis, resurrectionem meam adnuntiabitis, adventum meum sperabitis, donec iterum veniam ad vos de coelis. Similar endings occur also in the Liturgies of St. Mark and St. James and in several Syrian liturgies. The tracts direct the priest to bow thrice at accipit Jesus panem and after offering the chalice to God to chant Miserere mei Deus (Leabhar Breac) and the people to kneel in silence during this, the \\"perilous prayer\\". Then the priest takes three steps backwards and forwards. #Unde et memores has a few evident mistakes and is Gelasian in adding sumus after memores. #Supplices te rogamus adds et petimus and omits caelesti. #Memento etiam Domine et eorum nomina qui nos praecessereunt com signo fidei et dormiunt in somno pacis. This clause, omitted in the Gelasian, agrees with the Bobbio. In the latter the words commemoratio defunctorum follow. In the Stowe there is an intercessory interpolation with a long list of names of Old Testament saints, apostles and others, many of whom are Irish. The list concludes with the phrase, used also in the Mozarabic, et omnium pausantium. Moel Caich's addition to the Praeparatio Litany is wrongly inserted before these names. #Nobis quoque differs from the Gelasian in the order of the names of the female saints, agreeing with the Bobbio, except that it does not add Eugenia. #After Per quem haec omnia Moel Caich has added ter canitur and an Irish direction to elevate the principal host over the chalice and to dip half of it therein. Then follows in the original hand Fiat Domine misericordia tua etc. (Ps. xxxii, 22), to which ter cantitur probably refers. Moel Caich adds an Irish direction, \\"it is here that the bread is broken\\". The original hand has Cogno[v]erunt Dominum in fractione panis. Panis quem frangimus corpus est D. N. J. C. Calix quem benedicimus sanguis est D. N. J. C. in remissionem peccatorum nostrorum, interspersed with six Alleluias. Then over an erasure, Moelcaich inserts Fiat Domine misericordia, etc. Cognoverunt Dominum Alleluia, and a prayer or confession of faith, Credimus, Domine, credimus in hac confractione. This responsory answers to the Ambrosian Confractorium and the Mozarabic Antiphona ad Confractionem panis. Fiat misericordia etc. is the actual Lenten Mozarabic antiphon. The prayer Credimus etc. has a slight likeness to the recitation of the Creed at this point in the Mozarabic. The tract directs an elaborate fraction, varying according to the day, and resembling that of the Mozarabic rite and the arrangement (before Consecration) in the Eastern office of the Prothesis and like these having mystical meanings. The common division is into five, for ordinary days; for saints and virgins, seven; for martyrs, eight; for \\"the oblation of Sunday as a figure of the nine households of heaven and nine grades of the church\\", nine; for the Apostles, eleven; on the circumcision and Maundy Thursday twelve; on Low Sunday (minchasc) and Ascension, thirteen; and on Easter, Christmas, and Whitsunday, the sum of all the preceding, sixty-five. Directions are given to arrange the particles in the form of a cross within a circle, and different parts are apportioned to different classes of people. The Leabhar Breac omits all this and only speaks (as does the Stowe tract earlier) of a fraction in two-halves, a reuniting and a commixture, the last of which in the Stowe Canon comes after the Pater Noster. There is nothing about any fraction or commixture in the Bobbio, which, like the Gelasian, goes on from the Per quem haec omnia clause to the introduction of the pater noster. In the Ambrosian rite both the breaking of bread and mingling of wine occur at this point, instead of after the pater noster, as in the Roman. [In the St. Gall fragment there are three collects (found in the Gelasian, Leonine, and Gregorian books), and a Collectio ante orationem dominicam, which ends with the same introduction to the pater noster as in Stowe and Bobbio. These are all that come between the preface and the pater noster. The rest onward to the end of the communion is in Moel Caich's hand. The pater noster is preceded by the introduction: Divino magisterio edocti (instead of the Roman praeceptis salutaribus moniti) et divina institutione formati audemus dicere. This is the same in the Bobbio and the St. Gall fragment. There is nothing to show that this and the embolism which follows were variable, as in the Gallican (cf. Missale Gothicum and others) and the present Mozarabic. The embolism in the Stowe is nearly exactly the Gelasian, except that it omits the name of Our Lady and has Patricio for Andrea. The Bobbio embolism includes the Virgin Mary but not St. Andrew nor St. Patrick. The pater noster in the Books of Deer, Dimma, and Mulling has a different introduction and embolism and in the communion of the sick in the Stowe there is yet another. The Pax: Pax et caritas D. N. J. C. et communicatio sanctorum omnium sit semper nobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo. This is in the St. Gall fragment, in the same place. Prayer, Pacem mandasti, pacem dedisti, etc. The Commixture. Commixtio corporis et sanguinis D.N.J.C. sit nobis salus in vitam perpetuam. These words are not in the Bobbio or the St. Gall fragment but in the latter the commixture is ordered to be made here (mittit sacerdos sancta in calicem), and then the Pax to be given. In St. Germanus's description a form very like the Pax formula of the Stowe was said here by a priest, instead of a longer (and variable) benediction by a bishop. These were not in any way associated with the Pax, which in the Gallican, as now in the Mozarabic, came just before Sursum corda. The two ideas are mixed up here, as in the Roman and Ambrosian. The Communion: Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollis [sic] peccata mundi. These words, not in the Bobbio or the St. Gall, are nearly the words said before the communion of the people in the Roman rite. In the St. Gall the rubric directs the Communion of the people after the Pax. Probably these words had the same association in the Stowe as at present. Then follows in the Stowe, Pacem meam do vobis, Pacem relinquo vobis [John, xiv, 27]. Pax multa diligentibus legem tuam Domine, Et non-est in illis scandalum. Regem coeli cum pace, Plenum odorem vitae, Novum carmen cantate, Omnes sancti venite. Venite comedite panem meorum, Et bibite vinum quod miscui vobis. Dominus regit me [Ps. xxii, 1], with Alleluia after each clause. The St. Gall has only the quotation from John 14:27, before Psalm 22; but Venite comedite comes later. In the Bangor Antiphonary is a hymn of eleven four-lined stanzas, \\"Sancti venite, Christi corpus sumite\\", entitled \\"Ymnus quando comonicarent sacerdotes\\".) Then follow in the Stowe, the St. Gall, and in the Communion of the Sick in the Stowe, and in the Books of Deer, Dimma, and Mulling, a number of communion antiphons. The Bangor Antiphonary also gives a set. No two sets are alike, but some antiphons are common to nearly all. There is a resemblance to the Communion responsory, called Ad accedentes, of the Mozarabic rite, and similar forms are found in Eastern liturgies, sometimes with the same words. Possibly the Tricanum of St. Germanus was something of the same sort. At the end of these in the Stowe is the colophon Moel Caich scripsit, with which Moel Caich's corrections and additions to the mass end. Post communion The post communion Quos coelisti dono stasti is a Sunday post-communion in the Gelasian, for the Sixth Sunday after Pentecost in the Gregorian and for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity in the Sarum. It is given in the daily mass in the Bobbio, with the title Post communionem, and in the St. Gall. There are post-communions to the three masses which follow later. Two are Gelasian and the third is a form of a Gallican Praefatio or bidding prayer. Consummatio missae is the title in the Bobbio to the prayer Gratias tibi agimus.... qui nos corporis et sanguinis Christi filii tui communione satiasti, which ends the Mass there, in the Stowe and in the St. Gall. It seems to be compounded of two prayers in the Leonine (Jul. xxiv, and Sept. iii.) In the Gallican books it is a variable prayer. The dismissal formula in the Stowe is \\"Missa acta est in pace\\".

Built in 1906-07, it was the first purpose-built telephone exchange building in the city, and is a little-altered example of period exchanges built by the Southern New England Telephone Company. The building now houses city offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1983. Description and history The former Telephone Exchange Building is located in central Norwich, on the east side of Union Street directly behind Norwich Town Hall. It is a 2-1/2 story Georgian Colonial Revival brick building, with a gabled roof that has stepped gable ends. It is set on a brick foundation that is partially exposed, with a brownstone water table. The main facade is five bays wide, with its entrance centered under an elliptically curved archway. The archway, like the flanking window openings, has a brownstone keystone. The interior has been substantially altered from its original use, having housed the police station and city offices. The Southern New England Telephone Company (SNETCO) was responsible from introducing telephone service into Connecticut beginning in the late 19th century. The company built this building to house the telephone exchange and associated infrastructure when it upgraded service to the Norwich area in 1906-07. The main switchboard was located on the east wall of the second floor, while the basement housed an array of batteries for use in the common battery method of powering telephone service. The ground floor housed a lounge area for company employees, and a terminal room in which wires entered the building for distribution either to the switchboard or batteries. The building is very similar in design to exchanges the company built in Danbury and Middletown at the same time, and was the first purpose-built exchange building in Norwich. It remained in service until 1948, when the company moved the exchange to larger quarters on Chestnut Street. The building was acquired by the city, which converted it into a police station, with jail cells in the basement and offices on the main and upper levels.

Considered the most prominent figure of the consort clan during the Early L√Ω period, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© held the most powerful position in the royal court from 1140 to his death in 1158 except a short period in which ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was toppled by a group of officials led by the military commander V≈© ƒê√°i. According to dynastic historians such as Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n and L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was a skilled but arrogant official who profited his position, that came from his intimate relation with the Empress Mother L√™ th·ªã, to purge other opponents in the royal court by ruthless method. However, the discovery in the late 1930s of a stele engraved the description about the life of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© provided an alternative perspective about the official in which ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was highly praised for his noble character and devotion for the stability of the L√Ω Dynasty. History According to T·ª´ ƒëi·ªÉn b√°ch khoa to√†n th∆∞ Vi·ªát Nam, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was born in 1113 in H·ªìng Ch√¢u (now H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng), he had an elder sister ƒê·ªó th·ªã, who was the natural mother of the Emperor L√Ω Th·∫ßn T√¥ng, and a niece who married the Emperor L√Ω Anh T√¥ng. Being an intelligent and good-looking boy, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was selected to serve in the imperial palace at the age of twelve. After the coronation of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng in 1138, since ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was younger brother of the new Empress Mother ƒê·ªó th·ªã, he was promoted to the position of secretary of the imperial palace (Vietnamese: Cung ƒëi·ªán l·ªánh chi n·ªôi ngo·∫°i s∆∞) in 1140. One year after the appointment, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© began to prove his ability during the rebellion of the priest Th√¢n L·ª£i. In 1140, Th√¢n L·ª£i called himself the son of L√Ω Nh√¢n T√¥ng and raised a revolt against L√Ω Anh T√¥ng in the northern region (now Th√°i Nguy√™n). The army of Th√¢n L·ª£i successfully dominated the frontier region and defeated the army of the royal court led by the high-ranking official L∆∞u V≈© Nhƒ©. After the victory, Th√¢n L·ª£i, now self-appointed as King B√¨nh (B√¨nh V∆∞∆°ng), took a further step by directly attacking the capital ThƒÉng Long. It was ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© who assumed the task of stopping the military campaign of Th√¢n L·ª£i, a mission that he accomplished in the fifth month of 1141 after the major battle in Qu·∫£ng D·ªãch in which Th√¢n L·ª£i's army was heavily defeated by the forces of the L√Ω Dynasty led by ƒê·ªó Anh V≈©. Five months later, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© continued to conduct the campaign of wipping out the remaining force of Th√¢n L·ª£i which resulted in the total stability in the northern region, Th√¢n L·ª£i himself was captured by T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh and beheaded by the order of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng. During the regency of the Empress Mother L√™ th·ªã when the young emperor only ruled in name, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was the favorite official of the Empress Mother and thus became the most powerful figure in the royal court who held both military and civil matters of the country. In 1147 he went to a mission of inspecting the system of mandarins and domestic records in Ph√∫ L∆∞∆°ng. According to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© sent his wife to act as servant of the Empress Mother and profited his wife's position to secretly establish an intimate relation with the Empress Mother, as a result he got the favouritism of the Empress Mother L√™ th·ªã. Holding the most important position in the royal court, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© became arrogant and despised other officials, hence they began to form a group to topple ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© from power. The conspirators were several prominent figures in the royal court such as military commanders V≈© ƒê√°i, L∆∞∆°ng Th∆∞·ª£ng C√°, ƒê·ªìng L·ª£i, mandarins ƒê·ªó ·∫§t, D∆∞∆°ng T·ª± Minh and members of the royal family Prince Tr√≠ Minh, Marquis B·∫£o Ninh. The careful plan of V≈© ƒê√°i's group was partly successful when ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was imprisoned by the soldiers loyal to the group. But with the support of the Empress Mother, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was able to bribe some members of the group, therefore he was only tried by the emperor instead of being immediately killed as the initial plan. Following the order of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was deprived of all titles and demoted to farmer for the dynasty (c·∫£o ƒëi·ªÅn nhi). Again with the backing of the Empress Mother L√™ th·ªã, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was pardoned several times and rapidly restored his position in the royal court and finally took the position of Chancellor Regent (Th√°i √∫y ph·ª• ch√≠nh) with even more power than before. Afraid of another conspiracy, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© decided to form his own military unit called Ph·ª•ng qu·ªëc v·ªá (Guard of the Country) with more than 100 soldiers who were always ready to carry out any mission that ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© ordered. To get an official reason for his revenge against the group of V≈© ƒê√°i, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© made the young emperor believe that the toppling plan of V≈© ƒê√°i was a l√®se majest√© action and thus got the order from L√Ω Anh T√¥ng to punish V≈© ƒê√°i and his accomplices. As a result, except for the two members of the royal family who were only downgraded, all conspirators of the plan of overthrowing ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© were captured and subsequently killed by the Ph·ª•ng qu·ªëc v·ªá after the order of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈©. After the purge, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© continued to tighten the security measure in the imperial palace and capital ThƒÉng Long such as forbidding mandarins and members of royal family meeting in group of more than five persons to discuss or scorn, banning arms from the palace with the only exception for his Ph·ª•ng qu·ªëc v·ªá, and prohibiting eunuchs from entering the palace. Nguy·ªÖn Qu·ªëc, an ambassador of the L√Ω Dynasty after his voyage to the Song Dynasty, was also forced to commit suicide by ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© after the advice of Nguy·ªÖn Qu·ªëc for the emperor about a system of public report adapted from the Song Dynasty. Those events were detailed in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ in which the role of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was heavily criticized by the historians L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u and Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, for example Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n considered ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© \\"the utterly ruthless\\" (\\"k·∫ª ƒë·∫°i √°c\\") while L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u denounced his actions \\"nothing more heinous crime\\" (\\"kh√¥ng t·ªôi g√¨ to b·∫±ng\\"). Outside the royal court, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© still supervised the most important matters of the country. In the second month of 1154 he succeeded in pacifying the revolt of the mountainous people in Ch√†ng Long. He died in the eighth month of 1158. Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim in his Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c remarked that ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© did not take any further step in the royal court only because of the appearance of some skilled officials such as T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh, Ho√†ng Nghƒ©a Hi·ªÅn or L√Ω C√¥ng T√≠n. Modern view In the late 1930s, the researcher Ho√†ng Xu√¢n H√£n discovered the description of a stele formerly believed about the life of L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát. After carefully analysing its content, Ho√†ng Xu√¢n H√£n affirmed that the stele was in fact about the life of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈©, who held the same position chancellor (th√°i √∫y) as L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát, he was also convinced that the stele was engraved right after the death of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© and thus held the invaluable information about the life of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈©. Contrary to the harsh criticisms from dynastic historians like L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u or Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, the stele praised ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© as a devoted official with noble character of the L√Ω Dynasty, who could be compared with the legendary Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou in History of China. From the stele, the background of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© was also made clearer, such as his father's name was ƒê·ªó T∆∞·ªõng, the sister's son of L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát, while his mother, though unnamed, was highly extolled and his adoptive father was L√™ B√° Ng·ªçc, a prominent official in the royal court of L√Ω Th·∫ßn T√¥ng. Entered the imperial palace at a very young age, ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© quickly became dedicated servant and close friend of the Emperor L√Ω Th·∫ßn T√¥ng, who was three year younger than ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© and had strong confidence in the official.

Koehler was born in North Braddock, Pennsylvania on March 14, 1904. After high school, he enrolled at Grove City College and then transferred to Princeton University, where he majored in politics and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1926.

From 1934 to 1935, he was Special Assistant to United States Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings. He left public service in 1935, setting up a law practice in Baltimore. With the outbreak of World War II, in 1941 Koehler enrolled in the United States Navy as a lieutenant commander. (He would rise to the rank of commander by the time he left the navy.)

Description and history Whale Oil Row is located in downtown New London on the east side of Huntington Street between Federal Street and Governor Winthrop Boulevard. All four buildings are 2¬Ω story wood framed structures with gable roofs and mostly clapboarded exterior. All four are distinguished by their two-story gabled Greek Temple porticos, with fluted Ionic columns supporting entablatures with dentillated cornices. The gables above are fully pedimented with a semicircular window at the center. The first one (105 Huntington) is slightly wider than the others, extending on either side of the front portico. The other three have three-bay, flush-boarded facades with the main entrance in the left bay. With This assembly of high- quality Greek temple-front houses may be unique in the United States.

Built in 1876, it originally served as an interchange point between ocean-going freighters and the rail network of the Central Vermont Railroad. It is believed to be the only 19th-century pier in Connecticut. The pier was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Central Vermont Railroad Pier is located north of downtown New London, extending southward from Winthrop Point, a protrusion into the Thames River. It is a granite-lined earth-filled structure, long, just west of the Connecticut State Pier. Its shape is that of a hammer head: it is wide for much of its length, but an extended section at its end is wide. View of the pier in 2016 The pier was built in 1876 by the Central Vermont Railroad, which served central Massachusetts, Vermont, and parts of Canada. It is a rare surviving example of a 19th-century intermodal freight facility, and is believed to be the only remaining 19th-century pier in the state. The facility was at first used by the railroad for the transshipment of coal, with use gradually expanded to include other types of freight. Rail lines were run down the center of the pier, with goods offloaded from freighters directly onto trains. Facilities that once stood on the pier include coal loading equipment and storage bunkers; these and other facilities were removed in the decades after the railroad ended its use of the pier in 1946.

Peters' election to Parliament in 2000 was challenged by the People's National Movement (PNM). On nomination day, the PNM raised the issue that Peters and William Chaitan (UNC candidate for the Pointe-√†-Pierre seat) were ineligible to stand for election on the grounds that they held dual citizenship (Peters was a citizen of both Trinidad and Tobago and the United States, while Chaitan was a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago and Canada).\\"Stand-Off: Chronicle of a crisis\\", Trinicenter.com, 1 January 2001.Rickey Singh, \\"The changing face of T&T; politics\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 17 December 2000. The law requires that candidates in General Elections should not owe allegiance to foreign powers. This law was a relic of the 1961 Independence Constitution, which did not allow dual citizenship. The 1976 Republican Constitution allows dual citizenship, and under a law passed by the National Alliance for Reconstruction government in 1987 Trinidad and Tobago nationals who gave up their citizenship (for example, by becoming a naturalised citizen of a foreign country) can re-acquire their Trinidad and Tobago citizenship simply by filing an application. Although the constitution was altered to allow dual citizenship, the election laws were not. Given this internal inconsistency, together with the fact that the term \\"allegiance\\" was not defined in the law, the Elections and Boundaries Commission declined to rule Peters and Chaitan ineligible for the elections.

It is owned by the town of Groton and open to the public on weekends from April through November. It features 18th and 19th-century antiques. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 15, 1981. Description and history The Jabez Smith House is located in a rural-suburban area east of downtown Groton, on the east side of North Road near its junction with Newtown Road. The house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style house, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and an exterior finished in a combination of wooden shingles and clapboards. It is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a four-light transom window. The interior follows a typical center chimney plan, and is simply finished, with original plaster and woodwork. The house was built about 1783, presumably by Jabez Smith, the great-grandson of one of Groton's first proprietors, Reverend Nehemiah Smith. The house stands on a foundation built by Jabez's grandfather c. 1663. It is the only 18th-century farmhouse to survive on Groton's Poquonock Bridge area, which was once its principal agricultural area. Other foundations dot the property, including that of a 19th-century barn, and another of an outhouse, on which a modern reproduction has been built. The house remained in the hands of Smith descendants until 1974, when it was given to the town.

A fine local example of Renaissance Revival architecture, its construction was funded by Grace Palmer Melcer, the daughter of a local industrialist. and The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Description and history The former Uncasville School building is located in the village of Uncasville, on the west side of Norwich- New London Turnpike (Connecticut Route 32) south of Maple Avenue. It is a two- story brick building, its original core at the center of a U, whose flanking wings are additions. The historic main entrance is in the center of the U, framed by cast stone Doric columns supporting an entablature and pedimented gable. Windows are set in keystoned openings, and the building corners exhibit brick quoining. Stone stringcourses run above the basement and below the first-floor windows, and the building cornice is studded with modillion blocks. The school was built in 1917-18 to a design by architect Wilson Potter, a regionally well-known specialist in school buildings. Potter is also believed to have executed the designs for the wings, which are stylistically virtually indistinguishable from the original main block. Grace Palmer Melcer, whose family owned local mills, funded its construction and retained ownership of the building until 1925, when it was enlarged to address overcrowding. The school was a focal center of the community, hosting meetings and events of community groups, including evening adult education classes for immigrants.

It was conducted by the Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts of the Red Army with the goal of relieving the siege of Leningrad and encircling and destroying the German forces carrying out the siege. The offensive used no tanks because of the terrain, therefore it was down to the infantry and the artillery. The attacking Soviet forces found themselves under intense fire from German defensive positions, and the Red Army lacked proper artillery support against the German lines. The offensive stalled and the Soviets went over to the defensive. Field Marshal Georg von K√ºchler counterattacked with an operation called 'Wild Beast\\" (Operation Raubtier) and the Soviet 2nd Shock Army was cut off and surrounded. It was destroyed in June 1942 and its commander Andrey Vlasov was taken prisoner. Aftermath=Analysis The Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts lacked the armored vehicles, artillery ammunition, manpower reserves, fuel and food to mount sustained offensive operations against the German 18th Army. Inadequate Soviet firepower could not reduce the German system of fortified strongpoints in the forests. The Germans inflicted heavy losses on the attacking Soviet forces and forced the exhausted Red Army to the defensive. According to general Mikhail Khozin, Soviet armored forces and artillery firepower did not exist in sufficient quantities to exploit penetrations and defeat German counterattacks. Casualties Out of 327,700 men deployed into battle from 7 January ‚Äì 30 April 1942, the Volkhov Front lost 308,367, including 95,064 killed or missing and 213,303 wounded or sick.

Mans later went into politics, serving as the mayor of Trenton, Michigan and a member of the Michigan House of Representatives. Biography=Athlete Mans was born in Detroit, Michigan and raised in Trenton, Michigan. He attended Trenton High School where he won All-State honors in football. While in high school, Mans also won letters in basketball, tennis, track, and wrestling. In 1958, Mans enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he played at the right end position for the Michigan Wolverines football program from 1959 to 1961. He was captain of the 1961 team that compiled a 6-3 record. Mans was , and weighed in his senior year at Michigan. After the 1961 season, Mans played for the North All-Star team in the North-South Shrine Game. Mans graduated from Michigan in 1962 with a bachelor's degree in history. In June 1962, Mans signed with the St. Louis Cardinals of the NFL, but he did not play professionally. Coach In 1963, Mans began a career as a college football coach, accepting a position as the ends coach for the Eastern Michigan University football team. In July 1964, Mans was hired by the athletic director at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan to serve as the school's head wrestling coach, assistant director of intramural athletics, and assistant football coach. In 1966, he accepted an assistant coaching position at the University of Michigan where he remained for eight years from 1966 to 1973. Mans was one of two members of Bump Elliott's coaching staff to continue to serve under Bo Schembechler when he became coach in 1969. Mans later recalled that Schembechler brought a sharply different attitude to the program when he took over the reins: \\"He definitely brought a different philosophy to Michigan. He had that Ohio State background and said that in order to compete in the Big 10, we had to get tougher (with) practices, off-season conditioning and coaching.\\" In February 1974, Mans was hired as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University, where he remained for the 1974 and 1975 seasons. In his first season as head coach, Mans' team started the season with only one win in the first six games, but the team finished strong, going 3-1-1 in the final five games. In May 1976, Mans announced his resignation as Eastern Michigan's coach in what the Associated Press described as a \\"surprise move.\\" According to one newspaper report, Mans resigned \\"when it became apparent that EMU would place a greater emphasis on basketball, hiring former Detroit Pistons Coach Ray Scott.\\" Mans compiled an 8-12-1 record in two seasons as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan. Politics After retiring from coaching, Mans entered politics in his home town of Trenton, Michigan. He was a member of the Trenton School Board of Education from 1976 to 1983 and the mayor of Trenton from 1983 to 1989. In 1996, Mans was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives as a Democrat representing the 23rd District. In 1999, Mans drew negative publicity when The Detroit News reported on its front page that Mans had the worst attendance record of any state lawmaker, having missed six of every 10 votes in the Michigan House over the past year. Mans told the News that he had been \\"torn\\" on some issues and could not decide how to cast his vote. Mans continued to serve in the Michigan House until 2002 when term limits prevented him from running for another term. He ran an unsuccessful race for a seat in the Michigan State Senate in 2002, losing to Republican Bruce Patterson by a margin of 52,444 votes to 39,338. As of 2005, Mans was the City Administrator of Southgate, Michigan. Since at least 2006, Mans has worked in various positions in the municipal government of Flat Rock, Michigan, including positions as City Administrator, acting City Clerk and most recently economic development director. Mans also served as the chairman of the board of directors for the Detroit River International Wildlife RefugeDetroit River International Wildlife Refuge Alliance and has been active in efforts to develop the Humbug MarshDownriver Things.com-Humbug Marsh in Gibraltar, Michigan into a tourist destination.

(2003). International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas, p. 636. The agreement was signed on 25 January 1989. The text of the treaty sets out a roughly north‚Äìsouth boundary that is approximately long and is composed of a single straight-line maritime segment defined by two individual coordinate points. The boundary passes through the Bougainville Strait and the Solomon Sea. The boundary represents a modified equidistant line between Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The southern coordinate point is the tripoint with Australia. The treaty was under negotiation for 11 years prior to signing. In the end, the boundary that was settled on is roughly the same as the 1904 Anglo-German line created by the United Kingdom and German Empire. The full name of the treaty is Treaty between the Independent State of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands Concerning Sovereignty, Maritime and Seabed Boundaries between the Two Countries, and Cooperation on Related Matters. The treaty has not yet been ratified by the parties. In 1994, the two countries signed another treaty that set out principles in managing relations along the border, including provisions for unencumbered border crossing privileges for traditional inhabitants of the islands nearest to the maritime boundary.

He was one of the founders of the Washington State chapter of the American Institute of Architects as well as its first president.Ochsner, p. 20 For the majority of the 1880s, he practiced with George Meeker as Boone and Meeker, Seattle's leading architectural firm at the time. In his later years he briefly worked with William H. Willcox as Boone and Willcox and later with James Corner as Boone and Corner. Boone was one of Seattle's most prominent pre-fire architects whose career lasted into the early 20th century outlasting many of his peers. Few of his buildings remain standing today, many were destroyed in the Great Seattle fire including one of his most well known commissions, the Yesler ‚Äì Leary Building. He also designed a house for Henry Yesler as well as many of Seattle's earliest brick buildings, some still standing in the Pioneer Square district. Early life William Ely Boone was born in Pennsylvania on September 3, 1830 and was raised there.Ochsner, p. 19 He moved to Chicago as a young man and worked in construction as a carpenter for a railroad company before becoming involved with building design in Minneapolis around 1853. In 1859 he relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area where he resided for twenty years as a builder- contractor. He first visited the Puget Sound region in 1870 where he appears in the 1870 United States Census as residing in Olympia, Washington. While there he designed several small structures in and around that city and oversaw the design and construction of the federal prison at nearby McNeil Island, Washington.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 32 Seattle, Boone and Meeker He returned to Seattle permanently in 1881 where he worked between there and Tacoma. In 1883, he formed the partnership of Boone and Meeker with George Meeker of Oakland, California, who is thought to have remained in Oakland for the majority of their partnership. In Seattle, Boone designed mostly commercial buildings, being responsible for most of the city's earliest brick buildings. Yesler-Leary Building from the intersection of 1st Ave. and Yesler Way in a photograph by Theodore Peiser In 1883, his design was chosen for Henry Yesler and John Leary's business block at the corner of Front (First) Street and Mill (Yesler) Street. The design, based on San Francisco's original Phelan Block (1878‚Äì1881, destroyed) featured high Italianate and Second Empire detail and a prominent octagonal turret. It was described by local newspapers as Seattle's \\"finest building and symbolic of the city's new metropolitan character.\\" Boone and Meeker located their offices in the new building where they remained until the fire. Boone planned a four-story addition to the Yesler ‚Äì Leary Building but as Seattle's first building boom began to wind down in 1884, these plans were shelved.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 33Ochsner & Andersen, p. 34 The building was eventually built by Boone in 1888 but only at three floors and in a more subtle style. Schwabacher Building (1883, Destroyed) At the same time as the Yesler ‚Äì Leary Building, Boone was also preparing plans for a new residence for Henry Yesler. Completed in 1884, it was categorized as Eastlake style but combined elements of Victorian, Queen Anne and Eastlake. The home occupied an entire city block and was Seattle's largest home at the time. During 1884, Boone and Meeker shifted their focus to Tacoma, which had recently been selected as Northern Pacific Railway's West Coast terminus over Seattle, prompting a building boom there while Seattle's waned. There they designed the Annie Wright School and several other commercial and residential structures. By 1887, Seattle's economy began to rebound and construction activity was picking back up. Boone and Meeker resumed their position as the city's leading architectural office with several large commercial projects. By the late 1880s, architectural trends in the Northwest were catching up with the east coast, moving away from the highly decorated Italianate buildings clad in stucco and cast iron and more towards rusticated stone and exposed brick. This was reflected in one of the firm's first projects of 1887, the Toklas & Singerman Building at the Southwest corner of First and Columbia Streets.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 40 The following year, Boone oversaw the construction of one of Seattle's first modern office buildings, the Boston Block at Second and Columbia. Massive in size and practically unadorned, it reflected the influence of the Chicago School on Boone. The Boston Block housed the city's first passenger elevator and was one of the very few buildings in downtown to survive the great fire in 1889.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 41 In 1888 the firm submitted two different designs in a bid for Seattle's first two brick school houses. The school district wound up choosing both.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 42 Boone and Meekers first buildings in 1889 included the Ramona Hotel at 1st and Seneca Street (now demolished) and the I.O.O.F. Building in Belltown, one of his earliest surviving designs. Post- fire years Following the destruction of his offices in the Yesler ‚Äì Leary Building in the Great Seattle Fire, Boone moved the firm's offices into the Boston Block that was largely undamaged. By 1890, Boone was entering his 60s and his designs were becoming dated.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 161 His partnership with Meeker was dissolved in 1889 and he was once again a solo architect. The building boom following the great Seattle fire attracted many younger architects with fresh ideas such as the prolific Elmer Fisher to the area who soon replaced Boone as Seattle's top architect. Boone was still a respected architect in the city and continued to work, designing such buildings as the Marshall ‚Äì Walker Building (a.k.a. the Globe Building) in Pioneer Square and the massive New York and Occidental Buildings, both which were replaced by the Dexter Horton Building in 1922.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 180Ochsner & Andersen, p. 162-3 The New York Block was credited to the short-lived firm of Boone and William Willcox from 1891 to 1892 but the design is largely credited to Boone.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 98-9 Boone moved his offices into the New York Block following its completion. These later buildings displayed a more simplified design along the lines of Romanesque Revival architecture that emerged in the late 1880s, shaped by the influence of Henry Hobson Richardson, as well as Burnham and Root and other architects of the Chicago School, much in contrast to most of Boone's previous work and architectural knowledge.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 164 Boone and Willcox were also architects of the Plymouth Congregational Church, a building that reflected Willcox's previous experience in church design in the American Midwest.Ochsner & Andersen, p. 238-40 In 1891, Boone and Willcox were selected to plan the new campus for the University of Washington. The plan that included 16 buildings was halted after ten days of construction as a result of flaws in the legislation that created the university. Boone and Willcox dissolved their partnership in June 1892 and when construction resumed on the university in 1893, the firm's plans were dropped in favor of a competition for a single main building won by Charles Saunders.Ochsner, p. 18 Late career and death Boone, as well as most architects during the time, had little work in the years following the Panic of 1893 and effectively retired, putting his focus on matters of the Seattle Chamber of commerce, of which he was a member. It appears he only designed several small residences and one commercial building during this time. In 1894, he helped instigate the Washington State chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), laying the foundation for the architecture profession in Washington. Boone was elected the chapter's first president. In 1900, with the economy in full rebound, he formed a new partnership with James Corner, who had formerly worked with Warren Skillings. Together they designed several large warehouses that still stand in the Pioneer Square neighborhood. One of their biggest projects and one of Boone's last was the stone Seattle High School (later known as Broadway High School) in 1902 and 1903. After 1905 Boone reduced his practice activities and by 1910 had retired altogether.

Its four 149-kilowatt (200-horsepower) S.P.A. 6A engines were mounted in tandem pairs on the lower wing, with each engine driving one of four propellers, two mounted in a tractor and two in a pusher configuration. The P.3s tail was of biplane configuration with three rudders mounted between the two planes. The crew of four consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, nose gunner, and rear gunner; the pilot and co-pilot sat side by side in a cockpit just ahead of the wings, the nose gunner manned a machine gun mounted in a cockpit in front of them, and the rear gunner manned two machine guns, one in an amidships cockpit behind the pilots and another mounted in a ventral tunnel for defense against attacks from below. The P.3 made its first flight in 1923, and Piaggio later installed two 306-kilowatt (410-horsepower) Fiat A.20V engines on the aircraft.

The boundary is roughly north‚Äìsouth and consists of five straight-line maritime segments defined by six individual coordinate points. The convention came into force on 12 April 1984, after both states had ratified it.

It produces small brown mushrooms with conical to convex caps up to in diameter and stems long by thick. Reported as new to science in 2000, it is only known from the Pyrenees mountain range in northern Spain and southwestern France, where it grows on horse dung in grass fields at elevations of . The mushroom contains the psychoactive compound psilocybin. The possible depiction of this species in the 6,000-year-old Selva Pascuala rock art suggests that it might have been used in ancient religious rituals‚Äîthe oldest evidence of such usage in prehistoric Europe. Taxonomy The species was described by Mexican mycologist Gast√≥n Guzm√°n in a 2000 publication, based on specimens collected by Ignacio Seral Bozal near Huesca in northern Spain in 1995. Psilocybe hispanica is classified in the section Semilanceata of the genus Psilocybe because of its thick-walled spores and fruit body that bruises blue with handling. The specific epithet hispanica is Latin for \\"Spanish\\". Description The cap ranges in shape from somewhat conical to convex, and reaches diameters of . Its surface is smooth, somewhat sticky to dry, and brown to brownish-yellow. The gills are somewhat adnate, and brown-violaceous with whitish edges. The stem is long by thick, cylindrical, and slightly bulbous at the base. It is whitish-yellow, with vinaceous or blue-green to blackish tones towards the base. Mature specimens do not have a veil on the stem. The flesh is whitish, but like most psilocybin-containing species, stains blue when injured. The spores are ellipsoid and measure 12‚Äì14.5 by 6.5‚Äì8 Œºm. They have a brownish-yellow wall greater than 1 Œºm thick and a broad apical germ pore with an acute hilar appendix at the base (a region where the spore was once attached to the sterigma). The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32‚Äì44 by 8‚Äì12 Œºm. The cap cuticle is made of a layer 130‚Äì150 Œºm thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized hyphae measuring 1.5‚Äì4 Œºm broad. The hypodermium (the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5‚Äì8 Œºm broad, with a brownish incrusting pigment. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. Similar species Psilocybe semilanceata is roughly similar in appearance to P. hispanica, but may distinguished by its mycenoid (Mycena-like) appearance and acute umbonate cap. Although the grassland habitat of the two species is similar, P. semilanceata does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying grass roots. P. fimetaria also resembles P. hispanica, but it also has a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms of microscopic characteristics, P. fimetaria has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20‚Äì32 by 4‚Äì8 Œºm. P. hispanica differs from P. liniformans var. liniformans in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. P. liniformans var. americana has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22‚Äì33 by 5.5‚Äì9 Œºm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile. Deconica coprophila (formerly known as Psilocybe coprophila) is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem. Habitat and distribution Psilocybe hispanica is a coprophilous fungus (dung-loving), and produces fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in dense groups on horse dung; sometimes more than 25 fruit bodies can arise from the same dung. In Guzm√°n's original report, they were found in a Pyrenean meadow in Aragon, at an elevation of . In 2003, the species was reported from Tramacastillo de Tena, a small village in the Pyrenees; it was also reported to have \\"penetrated the French part of the Pyrenees\\". Within its restricted range, the mushroom is \\"very common\\" at altitudes of . Uses The mushroom is consumed recreationally by Spanish youths for its mind-altering effects; other mushrooms used recreationally in Spain include P. semilanceata and P. gallaeciae. Guzm√°n and Castro report that a 17th-century medallion found in Tena Valley in the southern Pyrenees had images of a devil and mushrooms carved on it. The mushrooms‚Äîpossibly either P. semilanceata or P. hispanica, according to Guzm√°n and Castro‚Äîwere used in witchcraft, a common practice in the valley during the Middle Ages. It has been argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo offers evidence that P. hispanica was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago. The rock shelter at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals, which previously had been described as \\"mushrooms\\", matched the general morphology of P. hispanica: the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom-like objects with convex to conical caps, and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous (wavy). Additionally, the mural shows a bull, which suggests an association with the coprophilic P. hispanica. Although the hallucinogenic species P. semilanceata is also widespread in the area where the mural was found, its differing shape (narrowly conical and acutely papillate) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural. If the interpretation is correct, the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe, and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of neurotropic fungi. The only older example is from Tassili n'Ajjer, in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria. In 1992, the Italian ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms, later tentatively identified as Psilocybe mairei, a species known from Algeria and Morocco.

Mosuo girl weaver in old-town Lijiang. The Mosuo () are a small ethnic group living in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China, close to the border with Tibet. Dubbed the 'Kingdom of Women' by the Chinese, the Mosuo population of about 50,000 live near Lugu Lake in the Tibetan Himalayas . Scholars use diverse terms and spellings to designate the Mosuo culture. Most prefer 'Mosuo' some spell it 'Moso', while a minority use neither term, but refer to them as the Na people. The Mosuo people are known as the 'Kingdom of Women' because the Na are a matrilineal society: heterosexual activity occurs only by mutual consent and mostly through the custom of the secret nocturnal 'visit'; men and women are free to have multiple partners, and to initiate or break off relationships when they please.  The origin of matrilineality and matriarchy = Introduction  Matrilineal cultures trace descent through the female line. It can also be considered a society in which one identifies with one's mother's lineage including familial lineage or property inheritance. Matriarchal cultures are run by women. Women hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property at the specific exclusion of men, at least to a large degree. Technically, Mosuo culture is matrilineal, but many anthropologists classify the Mosuo tribe as a \\"matriarchal society\\". The Mosuo themselves sometimes use the term matriarchal to describe their culture in order to bring more tourism and interest into their culture. Mosuo culture does have characteristics of a matriarchal society, in that women are the head of the household, the property is passed down through the female line, and the women make business decisions; yet political power tends to be in the hands of males, disqualifying them from matriarchy status (although, according to one NPR article, there was once a time when the political leaders of Mosuo villages were femalehttps://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/26/501012446/the-place- in-china-where-the-women-lead). Nevertheless, some anthropologists, like Peggy Reeves Sanday, determine that societies like Mosuo are in fact matriarchies. They note that, rather than a simple mirror of a patriarchal society, a matriarchy \\"emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices'\\". These scholars thus favour redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to modern matrilineal societies like the Mosuo.Mosuo people  Beginning of Mosuo matrilineality  The Mosuo are a small ethnic group living around China's Lugu Lake in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. Most Mosuo people celebrate a matrilineal culture, tracing lineage through the female side of the family. Historically the Mosuo lived in a feudal system where a larger peasant population was controlled by a small nobility. The nobility was afraid of the peasant class gaining power. Since leadership was hereditary, the peasant class was given a matriarchal system. This prevented threats to nobility power by having the peasant class trace lineage through the female line. This system has led to numerous distinct traits among Mosuo society.  Mosuo girls become Mosuo women  A Mosuo girl is considered a woman after she has participated in the coming of age ceremony. This ceremony, observed between the ages of 12 and 14, marks a Mosuo girl's transition to womanhood as well as a Mosuo man's transition into manhood. Here women are introduced to skirts and men to pants. Prior to the coming of age ceremony, Mosuo children dress the same and are restricted from certain aspects of Mosuo life, namely religious ceremonies. After the coming of age ceremony, Mosuo women are allowed their own private bedroom within the household in which they live; men are not afforded this advantage.  Mosuo 'marriage'  The Mosuo men practice tisese which translates as walking marriage in Chinese. However, the Mosuo term literally means 'goes back and forth'. Women have the choice to invite men of interest to their private sleeping room. If the man does not reciprocate this desire, he may simply never visit the woman's household. Men perform tisese in the true sense of the word. They can seek entry into the sleeping chambers of any woman they desire who also desires them. When feelings are reciprocal, a man will be allowed into a woman's private sleeping area. There he will spend the night and walk back to his mother's home in the early morning. Male suitors have been known to commonly descend into a woman's bedding chamber from a designated opening in the ceiling, commonly using a grappling hook, or modern rock climbing apparatus. Anthropologist Cai Hua termed tisese as 'furtive' or 'closed' visiting, meaning no public acknowledgement or obligations are required between parties. At night Mosuo adults are free to experience sexuality with as many or as few partners as they wish. Though a Mosuo woman is allowed to change partners whenever she likes, having only one sexual partner is not uncommon. Typically walking marriages are long term. During these unions a woman may become pregnant by the same man multiple times. But when children are born, they become a responsibility of the woman's family. Instead of marrying and sharing family life with spouses, adult Mosuo children remain in extended, multigenerational households with their mother and her blood relatives.  Typical Mosuo home  Mosuo matrilineality is largely based on the woman's role as head of the household. The Mosuo generally live in large extended families with many generations under one roof. Children in a household are taken care of by their mother's family. Their only male influences are their mother's brothers. Women who have participated in the coming of age ceremony are allotted a private room. Otherwise the typical Mosuo home consists of communal quarters, with no other private bedrooms or living areas.  Mosuo anthropology = Walking marriage vs. monogamous marriage  Anthropologists believe the premodern Mosuo family system has withstood modern Chinese marriage practices (identical to Western monogamous marriages) for many reasons. The practice of walking marriage allows two people to pursue intimacy as equals purely for the sake of satisfaction. Mosuo family principles challenge some of the world's most popular beliefs about marriage, parenting, and family life. The following are convictions about marriage that scholars, politicians, and citizens from the East and West (including traditional Chinese patriarchy) believe are true of family and kinship: * Marriage is a universal institution. * The quality and stability of a couple's marriage profoundly affects their children's welfare and security. * Parents who engage in multiple, short-term, extra-marital sexual liaisons irresponsibly threaten their children's emotional development. The Mosuo family life offers an exception that questions these convictions. Traditional Mosuo families value sexuality and romance separate from domesticity, parenting, caretaking, and economic situation. A Mosuo woman's sex life is strictly voluntary and nocturnal while her family life is a daily obligation.  Mosuo culture and female sexual freedom  The practice of tisese allows Mosuo women to avoid the double standard that regulates women's sexuality in other cultures. Women's sexual behaviors are judged equally. Girls and boys alike are raised learning to express sexuality to the same degree. The traditional Mosuo family and kinship affords women an equality and agency over their sexual and procreative lives that is rare in most cultures. Romantic and sexual unions are governed solely by the woman and man involved. Other family members are unconcerned with the romantic lives of their offspring. Mosuo women enjoy a freedom from reproductive demands that is unique among modern global cultures.  Today  Though the practice of tisese is a traditional Mosuo practice, today many couples have redefined the term. Many choose to cement their intimate bond through a small ceremony during which, in keeping with the secrecy of nocturnal visits, a representative of the man presents gifts to his lover's kin. After many presents have been given, the ceremony allows a man to openly visit his lover to assist with daily tasks or visit with her household. Still, whenever a man spends the night with a lover, even after such ceremony, he must return to his maternal residence in the morning.  Tourism  On Lake Lugu The rural area of the Mosuo Lugu Lake has only recently experienced modern developments. When the society became known as the 'Kingdom of Women', tourists began to flock to the area. The Mosuo responded to these visitors by building hotels and other attractions to bring more visitors. Many Mosuo women make a living managing these hotels. The idea of 'walking marriages' has convinced many visitors that the Mosuo lead a salacious sexual life. It is common for visitors to flirt with the local Mosuo women in an effort to seduce them.

When Samuel approaches to visit Emma, Lauren hides, only to have Emma tell Samuel she is there. When Samuel confronts her, he gets Eli to deal with her, but she escapes. Samuel still wishes for Claire Bennet to join his carnival family, so in one final move, he brings Claire to her father who is being held in the House of Mirrors.Damien reveals Noah Bennet's past memories to Claire in hopes that she will lose all respect for her father and join him.

Rendell played as a ruckman and made his debut with the West Torrens Football Club in the SANFL in 1977 where he played 79 games. He left South Australia in 1981 to play with the Fitzroy Football Club in the VFL, wearing the No. 9 guernsey. In his first year, he played mainly at full forward and kicked forty-five goals, but he admitted in later years he did not enjoy it. With the return of Ron Alexander to Western Australia, however, Rendell was to make the ruck position his own, barring injuries, until 1987. Rendell did have quite a number of injuries, however, after 1983, with the result that he played only 26 of 43 games in 1984 and 1985.See The Age, 12 June 1984 Rendell won Fitzroy's 1982 and 1983 best and fairest awards, and was appointed captain from 1985 to 1987. In one of the most amazing games in V/AFL history, Rendell, who had not kicked a goal in his previous seventeen games for Fitzroy, was used as a seventh forward to counter North Melbourne's Gary Dempsey's habit of marking in the last line resulting in Rendell kicked eight goals and the Lions winning the game by 150 points, which at the time more than doubled the previous biggest loss by a minor premier. Rendell played just one game with the Lions in 1988, the rest of the year spent in the reserves, which Rendell put down to a misunderstanding with coach David Parkin. He recovered so well in 1989, though, that he was again among the club's most valuable players in a drive to the finals that was deflated by an injury to top forward Richard Osborne. He retired at the end of 1991 after 164 games and 101 goals with Fitzroy. However he soon reversed that decision and moved to the Brisbane Bears, who persuaded him to continue playing. He did so in his final year in 1992, playing 13 games and booting 7 goals for the Bears before retiring for good. Rendell was an assistant coach and match-day tactician with the St Kilda Football Club alongside Grant Thomas, until he was sacked at the end of 2006 with the appointment of Ross Lyon. In 2007 he returned to South Australia, joining the Adelaide Football Club as their recruitment manager. Rendell resigned as Adelaide's recruiting manager on 16 March 2012 following issues around reported comments in relation to the recruitment of Australian Aborigines. He was later, with the AFL's permission, hired by Collingwood as part of their recruiting department. In 2015 he also took up the part-time task of coaching Collingwood's ruckmen. Rendell's brother Tim was a promising ruckman who also played for West Torrens and was recruited by Fitzroy but did not play a game due to chronic injury.

Its parish is also responsible for services at Saint Jude's Episcopal Church, another National Register-listed chapel in Seal Harbor. Description and history St. Mary's is set on the south side of South Shore Road, directly opposite its junction with Kimball Road. It is a cruciform structure, built of stone and stucco, with the long axis set parallel to the road. It has classic Late Gothic features, including buttresses along the nave and at the corners of the transepts, and a crenellated central tower at the crossing point. The nave features a raised roof section with Gothic-arched clerestory windows. The church features a number of stained-glass windows, some of which may predate its construction. The church is one of three known to be the work of Maine architect Harry Vaughn, and is the only one executed in stone. It was built in 1902 to replace an earlier chapel which the summer congregation had outgrown. It was built in part using granite quarried from a roadbed that the community had concluded needed to be lowered.

The tunnel is part of a route across Amsterdam that connects the Ringweg North with the Ringweg South near Duivendrecht, via Nieuwe Leeuwarderweg, Valkenburgerstraat, Weesperstraat, Wibautstraat and Gooiseweg (S112). The total length of the tunnel, including on- and off-ramps, is 1682 metres. The covered part is 1039 metres long. The deepest point of the tunnel lies 20.32 metres below sea- level. The tunnel was built of sections of rectangular concrete constructions of 24.8 x 8.75 metres, subdivided into two tubes for automobile traffic and in between tubes for cables and pipes. Ventilators, located in two ventilation buildings on the banks of the IJ, blow clean air into the traffic areas via tubes under the surface of the road and openings in the tunnel walls, and suck polluted air out. At the entrance on the north side there are sun-blocking lattices over the road. These lattices are missing on the south side, where the Nemobuilding is built on top of the tunnel. The traffic in the tunnel is monitored by 22 closed-circuit cameras. A heating system prevents the forming of ice on the surface of the road, and a computer regulates the intensity of light at the beginning and the end of the tunnel, so that a gradual transition from tunnel light to daylight takes place. The route through the IJtunnel is an urban avenue, formed out of two divided tunnels, each with two lanes of traffic. This four-lane road continues to the A10 in the north and to the Prins Hendrikkade in the south, where it is reduced to two lanes, one in each direction.  Access restrictions  On 28 May 2019, the IJtunnel was opened to pedestrians, bicycles and mopeds, when public transport and ferry services across the IJ were suspended due to industrial action. The IJtunnel is a class D tunnel under the ADR treaty. The classification means that no one may use the tunnel to transport dangerous goods that may cause a large explosion, or a large toxic release, or a large fire. The tunnel is also an entry point to Amsterdam's low emission zone, and there is a height limit of 4 meters. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles, bicycles and mopeds are generally not allowed to use the IJtunnel. However, the ban on pedestrians, bicycles and mopeds may be temporarily lifted if public transport and ferry services across the IJ are suspended: such a situation occurred in 1993, 1997, 2005 and 28 May 2019. There was also a special open day on 26 October 1968, to mark the opening of the tunnel.

The building was part of the Bockenheim campus of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University and until 2013 housed the offices and seminar rooms of the departments of Social Sciences and Education. AfE is an acronym for Abteilung f√ºr Erziehungswissenschaft (Department of Pedagogy); however, this department never moved in because it was closed before the construction of the tower was finished, which happened in 1972. The tower was demolished on February 2, 2014. Background Planning and construction of AfE-Turm began in the early 1960s. The building became necessary in 1961, when the College of Pedagogy was incorporated into the University, and the old Bettinaschule in the Westend turned out to be inadequate even as a provisional arrangement. The building inherently lacked the required functionality. The tower was briefly the tallest building in Frankfurt until the construction of the City-Haus. The north side of the tower housed the library of the social sciences, as well as seminar rooms with 1.5 times the floor height. The south side consisted of offices only a single floor high, which required an intricate system of staircases and split-levels between the two halves, considerably complicating orientation. After the construction, a cafeteria was established in the top floor, but was closed for lack of popularity. This floor was not accessible with all lifts, and was considered a hard-to-find secret due to the good view in all directions. The student-managed TuCa (Tower Caf√©) on the ground floor was cleared by the police at the behest of the university administration, in order to open a caf√© managed by the Studentenwerk, named the C'AfE. Since the beginning of 2007, the TuCa sat \\"in exile\\" on the fifth floor. The tower was designed for 2,500 students. However, the building was occupied since its opening with a multiple of that, so that at the seven elevators have waiting periods of up to fifteen minutes. In August 2005, a University employee was killed in an accident when her lift got stuck between two floors, and she attempted to exit. It is still controversial whether this accident was a result of human error or a series of almost daily failures of the building's technology. Since the tower was to be demolished within the next few years, the university administration had to avoid all non-essential renovation work. At intervals, however, facade repairs had to be carried out. The tower was a popular destination for student protests, as it could be completely sealed off with relatively few helpers, in contrast to most other buildings of the university. The dramatically worsened study conditions within the tower in recent years were another motive. The resulting tower blockades were an integral part of periodic protests at the Goethe University for many years.  Demolition  The departments of Social Sciences and Education moved to the University's Westend Campus in Spring 2013. The building had been empty since the end of April 2013. The gradual demolition of the tower commenced in July 2013 and was finalized at the end of January 2014, when authorities gave the green light for its implosion. The implosion occurred on 2 February 2014, at 10:04 CET.\\"AfE-Turm: Sprengung des AfE-Turms genehmigt\\", Frankfurter Rundschau, January 24, 2014, Retrieved on January 31, 2014 (german) File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm-Sprengung (1).JPG File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm-Sprengung (2).JPG File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm-Sprengung (3).JPG File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm- Sprengung (4).JPG File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm-Sprengung (5).JPG File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm-Sprengung (6).JPG File:Frankfurt, AfE-Turm-Sprengung (7).JPG 140202 Afe-Tower Blasting.jpg  See also  * List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt * List of tallest buildings in Germany * List of tallest voluntarily demolished buildings ReferencesExternal links * *AfE-Turm at A View On Cities Category:1972 establishments in Germany Category:2014 disestablishments in Germany Category:Goethe University Frankfurt Category:University and college buildings completed in 1972 Category:Skyscrapers in Frankfurt Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2014 Category:Former skyscrapers Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Germany Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Destroyed landmarks in Germany Category:Buildings and structures demolished by controlled implosion ","title":"AfE-Turm"},{"id":"25888271","text":"Ambat Sivarama Menon was a pre-independence Indian politician.

It is based on the Chinese legend of the Butterfly Lovers, but in a wuxia setting. Plot The movie begins with an explanation of the legend of the Butterfly Lovers. Zhu Yanzhi disguises herself as a man to go to Soul Ease Clan, which she must do to learn fighting skills which will help protect her family. While there she meets Bro Shan who protects her and calls her Little Bro, unaware that she is a woman. She has a love of butterflies and decorates Bro Shan's sword with two butterflies. At first Bro Shan is angry at Yanzhi for drawing butterflies on his sword but eventually accepts it. The pair develop a close friendship. Bro Shan eventually realizes that Yanzhi is a woman and makes a butterfly pin for her. Eventually, Bro Ma, Yanzhi's childhood friend comes to pick her up and take her back to her family. Yanzhi is pleased that she will be going home but says she will miss Bro Shan, who she is now in love with. Before she leaves, Bro Shan takes her to Butterfly Valley, a beautiful grassy green field where hundreds of butterflies fly. Yanzhi is taken back to her family and is horrified when she realizes that her parents have set up an arranged marriage between her and Bro Ma. She refuses to follow through with the marriage. However, Bro Ma chains up Yanzhi in order to force her to marry him. When Bro Shan comes to visit, he promises that he will rescue her but Bro Ma is suspicious of him and creates a plan to prevent any interference. He imprisons Yanzhi's parents and tells Yanzhi that he will kill Bro Shan and her parents unless she marries him. Fearing for their lives, she promises that she will marry Ma. When Shan comes to visit, Yanzhi tells him that she is no longer in love with him because their backgrounds are too different. She returns the butterfly pin and cuts off a lock of her hair to give to Shan (an ancient Chinese tradition, similar to returning an engagement ring). Shan, believing that Yanzhi no longer loves him, is heartbroken and leaves. Yanzhi is also heartbroken because now she will have to marry a man she does not wish to marry. During the night, Teacher Herbal Head, a teacher from Soul Ease Clan, visits her and gives her a herb that will make her appear dead. On the day of the wedding, Yanzhi eats this. Everyone believes her to be dead, including Bro Ma, who is horrified, and exclaims \\"You would rather die than marry me?!\\". The wedding turns into a funeral. Bro Shan is still heartbroken, but decides that he must visit Yanzhi to wish her well, believing that Yanzhi is happy, so he should be happy. On the way there, he is met by Yanzhi's serving girl, who tells him that Yanzhi has committed suicide. Bro Shan is horrified because he realizes that Yanzhi wasn't happy and had only agreed to marry Ma in order to save him. He decides that he will bury Yanzhi in Butterfly Valley, where she will be happy. Shan comes to Yanzhi's funeral to get her body. A bloody battle occurs between Shan and Ma. Both Ma and Shan are suffering from horrible injuries by the time Ma finally surrenders. Shan takes Yanzhi's body and carries her all the way to butterfly valley. He digs a grave for her and lays her there to rest. Finally succumbing to his injuries and exhaustion he lies down in the grave, next to Yanzhi, kisses her, and dies. Shan's friends see the two lovers, side by side, and decide to finish what Shan had started; They fill up the grave. Yanzhi, however, is still not really dead. She cannot move or speak, but she can hear. She wakes up and sees Shan next to her, dead, and sees Shan's friends burying them together. She whispers, \\"Wait for me\\", closes her eyes, and also dies, so that she can be with Shan. When the grave is completely filled, the two butterflies on Shan's sword flutter off the sword and fly into the air, together. In the afterlife, we see that Yanzhi and Shan are finally together.

Celyphoides and Loxoterma are sometimesSee e.g. references in Savela (2005a,b) listed as a synonym of Olethreutes. But the type species of the first is Tortrix flavipalpana (a junior synonym of C. flavipalpana), and that of the second is T. latifasciana (a junior synonym of C. aurofasciana). This makes Celyphoides and Loxoterma junior subjective synonyms of Celypha, at least in its present delimitation. Celyphoides, meanwhile, was a nomen nudum for 5 years. It was first used by R. Agenjo Cecilia in 1955, but only properly established by N.S. Obraztsov in 1960. FootnotesReferences * (2009a): Online World Catalogue of the Tortricidae - Genus Celypha account. Version 1.3.1.

They are found mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, being especially common in the Neotropics. But some occur elsewhere, such as on the Hawaiian Islands.Baixeras et al. (2010ab) At least some of them can be recognized by their wing veins. In the hindwings, vein 3 and 4 originate from a common stalk, and are approached by the fifth vein at its end. In the forewings, veins 4-6 converge at the termen.Clarke (1986) These moths are mostly small and inconspicuous. But C. plebejana is an occasional pest of cotton (and some other mostly malvaceous plants) and has become widely distributed by trade in agricultural produce, while the lantana flower-cluster moth (C. lantana) is employed in Lantana biocontrol and has been deliberately introduced to some locations.

It is chronologically the second volume of the complete seven volume edition of the collected stories devoted to the characters. It is an expansion of Leiber's earlier collection Two Sought Adventure, issued by Gnome Press during 1957. The earlier collection contained seven of the ten stories of Swords Against Death, plus an \\"Induction\\" omitted from the expanded edition, which was instead republished in its companion volume, Swords and Deviltry (1970). Swords Against Death was first published in paperback during 1970 by Ace Books, which reprinted the title numerous times through August 1990; later paperback editions were issued by ibooks (2003) and Dark Horse (2007). It has been published in the United Kingdom by New English Library (1972), Mayflower Books (1979) and Grafton (1986). The first hardcover edition was issued by Gregg Press during December 1977. The book has also been gathered together with others of the series into various omnibus editions; The Three of Swords (1989), Ill Met in Lankhmar (1995), The First Book of Lankhmar (2001), and Lankhmar (2008). The book collects ten short stories, eight of which were originally published in the magazines Unknown for August 1939, Unknown Worlds for February 1942 and February 1943, Unknown Fantasy Fiction for November 1940, and June 1941, Other Worlds Science Stories for May 1953, Suspense for Fall 1951, and Fantastic Stories of Imagination for August 1963, and two of which first appeared in the book itself. Contents *\\"The Circle Curse\\" (1970) *\\"The Jewels in the Forest\\" (1939; originally titled \\"Two Sought Adventure\\") *\\"Thieves' House\\" (1943) *\\"The Bleak Shore\\" (1940) *\\"The Howling Tower\\" (1941) *\\"The Sunken Land\\" (1942) *\\"The Seven Black Priests\\" (1953) *\\"Claws from the Night\\" (1951; originally titled \\"Dark Vengeance\\") *\\"The Price of Pain-Ease\\" (1970) *\\"Bazaar of the Bizarre\\" (1963) Plot The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories concern the lives of two larcenous but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of Nehwon. The stories in Swords Against Death concern the duo as they leave Lankhmar after the deaths of their first loves, only to find their resolution never to return pointless (\\"The Circle Curse\\"). There follow a miscellaneous series of adventures from their wanderings, including a quest for treasure in a dwelling with unique defenses (\\"The Jewels in the Forest\\"), a return bout with the Thieves' Guild they hold responsible for their ladies' deaths (\\"Thieves' House\\"), an ensorcelled journey to a far-away land (\\"The Bleak Shore\\"), an encounter with a beast-haunted stranger (\\"The Howling Tower\\"), a dangerous visit to the Nehwonian equivalent of Atlantis (\\"The Sunken Land\\"), a conflict with a murderous priesthood (\\"The Seven Black Priests\\"), a magical plague afflicting Lankhmar (\\"Claws from the Night\\"), a final parting with their deceased loves in the Shadowland (\\"The Price of Pain- Ease\\"), and an investigation of a mysterious shop that is other than it seems \\"\\"Bazaar of the Bizarre\\"). Prequel The events of Robin Wayne Bailey's authorized Fafhrd and Gray Mouser novel, Swords Against the Shadowland (1998), occur approximately between Swords and Deviltry and this book, including some of the same time as \\"The Circle Curse\\".

Today however, these are generally ‚Äì but not universally, e.g. regarding the supposedly monotypic Griselda, or Catastega which is here considered separate but included in Epinotia elsewhere ‚Äì included here again at least pending a thorough taxonomic review. Now-invalid scientific names (junior synonyms and others) of Epinotia are: * Acalla H√ºbner, [1825] * Astatia H√ºbner, 1825 * Asthenia H√ºbner, 1825 * Cartella Stephens, 1852 * Ccalla (lapsus) * Curtella (lapsus) * Epinotis (lapsus) * Evertia (lapsus) * Evetria H√ºbner, 1825 * Griselda Heinrich, 1923 * Hamuligera Obraztsov, 1946 * Hikagehamakia Oku, 1974 * Hypermecia Guen√©e, 1845 * Lithographia Stephens, 1852 * Neurasthenia Pierce & Metcalf, 1922 * Paedisca Treitschke, 1830 * Pamplasia (lapsus) * Pamplusia Guen√©e, 1845 * Panoplia H√ºbner, 1825 * Paragrapha Sodoffsky, 1837 * Phlaeodes Guen√©e, 1845 * Phloeodes (lapsus) * Podisca (lapsus) * Poecilochroma Stephens, 1829 * Proteopteryx Walsingham, 1879 * Steganoptera (lapsus) * Steganoptica (lapsus) * Steganoptycha Stephens, 1834 Halonota has also been listed as junior synonym of Epinotia. But its type species Pyralis populana is today placed in Pammene, and thus Halonota is a junior subjective synonym of the latter genus.

It belongs to subfamily Olethreutinae, and therein to the tribe Grapholitini, of which it is the type genus.Baixeras et al. (2009a) Taxonomy and systematics Georg Friedrich Treitschke established Grapholita in 1829 - in the 7th volume of Schmetterlinge von Europa, with a type species he claimed to be \\"Pyralis dorsana\\", a taxon established by Johan Christian Fabricius in his 1775 Systema Entomologiae. But Treitschke was misled by Jacob H√ºbner's misidentification of Fabricius' moth.Treitschke, (1829), Baixeras et al. (2009a) The actual P. dorsana is today known as Dichrorampha petiverella, as it had already been described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema Naturae as Phalaena (Tinea) petiverella. The \\"Pyralis dorsana\\" of H√ºbner and Treitschke was subsequently identified as the species described as Tortrix lunulana by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schifferm√ºller in 1775, which thus is today Grapholita lunulana.Baixeras et al. (2009a,c) Species Grapholita currently has 126 recognised species, though the genus' distinctness from and delimitation against Cydia is in need of further study:Baixeras et al.

It is chronologically the fifth volume of the complete seven volume edition of the collected stories devoted to the characters. The book is an expansion of Leiber's earlier novella \\"Scylla's Daughter\\", which was published originally in the magazine Fantastic Stories of Imagination for May 1961. The full novel first published in paperback format during 1968 by Ace Books company, which reprinted the title numerous times through 1986; a later paperback edition was issued by Dark Horse (2008).

Plot The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories concern the lives of two larcenous but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of Nehwon. In The Swords of Lankhmar the duo is hired by the city of Lankhmar to protect its grain fleets, which have become prey to a mysterious threat. A sea serpent ridden by an explorer from another world is encountered, but the true foes prove to be legions of intelligent rats. Returning to Lankhmar, the protagonists find the whole city besieged by the rats. The Mouser, magically shrunken to rat size, spies out their plans, but the rats' victory appears certain until the intervention of the Gods of Lankhmar and the rats' own ancient enemies. Awards Fantastic \\"Scylla's Daughter\\" was nominated for the 1962 Hugo Award for Short Fiction.

It is chronologically the sixth volume of the complete seven volume edition of the collected stories devoted to the characters. It was first published in paperback format during July 1977 by Ace Books company, which reprinted the title numerous times through 1990; a later paperback edition was issued by Dark Horse (2007). It has been published in the United Kingdom by Mayflower Books and Grafton (1986, 1987). The first hardcover edition was issued by Gregg Press during December 1977. The book has also been gathered together with others in the series into various omnibus editions; Swords' Masters (1990), Return to Lankhmar (1997), and The Second Book of Lankhmar (2001). The book collects seven short stories and one novella, three of which were published originally in the anthologies Flashing Swords! #1 (1973) and Flashing Swords! #3: Warriors and Wizards (1976), the collections The Book of Fritz Leiber (1974) and The Second Book of Fritz Leiber (1975), and the magazines Fantastic for November 1973 and April 1975, Whispers for December 1973, and Cosmos Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazine for May and July 1977. \\"The Frost Monstreme\\" and \\"Rime Isle\\" have also been published separately as the novel Rime Isle (1977). While the stories were ostensibly assembled in chronological order by the author, internal evidence indicates that the third, \\"Trapped in the Shadowland\\", which is a direct sequel to the preceding volume, The Swords of Lankhmar, should actually have been placed first. Contents *\\"The Sadness of the Executioner\\" (1973) *\\"Beauty and the Beasts\\" (1974) *\\"Trapped in the Shadowland\\" (1973) *\\"The Bait\\" (1973) *\\"Under the Thumbs of the Gods\\" (1975) *\\"Trapped in the Sea of Stars\\" (1975) *\\"The Frost Monstreme\\" (1976) *\\"Rime Isle\\" (1977) Plot The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories concern the lives of two larcenous but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of Nehwon. In Swords and Ice Magic the duo face a series of challenges from Death of greater or lesser subtlety (\\"The Sadness of the Executioner\\", \\"Beauty and the Beasts\\", \\"Trapped in the Shadowland\\" and \\"The Bait\\"), the pique of deities they formerly worshiped whose names they now rarely even use in vain (\\"Under the Thumbs of the Gods\\"), a voyage to the strange equatorial ocean of Nehwon (\\"Trapped in the Sea of Stars\\"), and recruitment to succor Nehwon's Iceland, the legendary Rime Isle, menaced by Sea Mingols and a pair of refugee gods (\\"The Frost Monstreme\\", \\"Rime Isle\\"). Relation to other works \\"Under the Thumbs of the Gods\\" includes an appearance by Joanna Russ's heroine Alyx. Reception C. Ben Ostrander reviewed Swords and Ice Magic in The Space Gamer No. 12. Ostrander commented that \\"Included in this book are some of the very best Fafhrd & Gray Mouser stories written. Mr. Leiber's stories help shape the growing field of fantasy literature, and I expect to see the stories in this volume re-written by aspiring writers, and get printed. But remember, Fritz Leiber did it first, and better.\\" Awards Swords and Ice Magic was nominated for the 1978 World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology/Collection.

It is the type genus of its tribe (Olethreutini) and subfamily (Olethreutinae). Celyphoides, Loxoterma and Paracelypha are sometimesSee e.g. references in Savela (2005) listed as junior synonyms of Olethreutes. But the type species of the first is Tortrix flavipalpana (now Celypha flavipalpana), that of the second is T. latifasciana (now C. aurofasciana), and that of the third is Phalaena rivulana (now Syricoris rivulana). This makes Celyphoides and Loxoterma junior subjective synonyms of Celypha and Paracelypha a junior subjective synonym of Syricoris, at least according to the present delimitation of these genera. Species This genus has long served as \\"wastebin genus\\" for Olethreutinae, many of which were formerly placed here but are nowadays assigned to related genera.

But the type species of Eucelis and Trycheris is Tortrix mediana (a junior synonym of P. aurana), that of Orchemia is O. gallicana (a junior synonym of P. gallicana), and that of Halonota is Pyralis populana (a junior synonym of P. populana). Thus, Eucelis, Halonota, Orchemia and Trycheris are all junior subjective synonym of the present genus.

Amenemhat VI certainly enjoyed a short reign, estimated at 3 years or shorter. He is attested by a few contemporary artefacts and is listed on two different king lists. He may belong to a larger family of pharaohs including Amenemhat V, Ameny Qemau, Hotepibre Qemau Siharnedjheritef and Iufni. Attestations ;Historical Amenemhat VI is listed on the Turin canon, a king list redacted in the early Ramesside period and which serves as the primary historical source regarding the Second Intermediate Period. In the latest reading of the canon by the Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt, Amenemhat VI appears in the 7th column, 10th row under his prenomen Seankhibre.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 33-34 This corresponds to the 6th column, 10th row in Alan Gardiner's and J√ºrgen von Beckerath's reading of the Turin king list.Alan Gardiner: The Royal Canon of Turin, Griffith Institute, new edition 1997, J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen, M√ºnchner √§gyptologische Studien, Heft 49, Mainz : Philip von Zabern, 1999, , see pp.90‚Äì91, king No 7. Amenemhat VI is also mentioned on the Karnak king list, entry 37.This corresponds to entry 34 in Ryholt and Baker's numbering of the king list. ;Archeological Amenemhat VI is attested by a few contemporary artefacts. These include 2 cylinder seals from el-Mahamid el-Qibli in Upper Egypt,One of the two cylinder seals is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, see online catalog one of which is dedicated to \\"Sobek Lord of Sumenu\\".William C.

A stele from Abydos mentions an official, Seankhibre-Seneb-Senebefeni, whose name is likely a basilophorous one, dedicated to Seankhibre Amenemhat.Marie-Pierre Foissy-Aufr√®re (editor): √âgypte & Provence.

Dynastie) Teil 1 : Die 12. Dynastie, in Orientalia 57 (1988) see p. 267-268 no. 57 However, recent research indicates that the latter monument may belong to a different king with a similar name, Seankhibtawy Seankhibra. Chronology ;Relative chronological position The relative chronological position of Amenemhat VI is secured thanks to the Turin canon. His predecessor was a poorly known pharaoh named Iufni and his successor was an equally obscure king, Semenkare Nebnuni.Thomas Schneider in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, and David A. Warburton (editors): Ancient Egyptian Chronology, Handbook of Oriental Studies, available online, see p. 176 for the chronology. ;Absolute position and dating The absolute chronological position of Amenemhat VI is less certain owing to uncertainties affecting the earlier kings of the dynasty. According to Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, he was the 8th king of the dynasty, whereas Thomas Schneider, Detlef Franke and von Beckerath see him as the 7th ruler. The duration of Amenemhat's reign is lost due to the poor state of preservation of the Turin papyrus and only the number of days is readable as [...] and 23 days. Ryholt nonetheless assigns him a short reign of 3 years spanning 1788-1785 BC. Extent of rule It is unclear whether or not Amenemhat VI reigned over the whole of Egypt. He likely had control over Lower Nubia, which had been conquered by the 12th Dynasty and would not be abandoned before at least another 60 years. His control over Lower Egypt is debated. Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars‚Äîamong them, Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker,Gae Callender: The Middle Kingdom Renaissance (c. 2055-1650 BC) in Ian Shaw (editor): The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press (2004), Janine Bourriau: The Second Intermediate Period (c.1650-1550 BC) in: Ian Shaw (editor): The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, 2000, Oxford University Press, it is rejected by others including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen who contend that the 14th Dynasty could not have existed before the later king of the 13th Dynasty Sobekhotep IV.Daphna Ben-Tor & James and Susan Allen: Seals and Kings, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research (BASOR) 315, 1999, pp.47-73.Manfred Bietak: Egypt and Canaan During the Middle Bronze Age, BASOR, 281 (1991), pp. 21-72, esp. p. 38, available onlineDaphna Ben-Tor: Scarabs, Chronology, and Interconnections: Egypt and Palestine in the Second Intermediate Period, Volume 27 of Orbis biblicus et orientalis / Series archaeologica: Series archaeologica, Academic Press Fribourg 2007, , excerpts available online Family The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposes that Amenemhat VI was a member of a larger royal family including pharaohs Sekhemkare Amenemhat V, Ameny Qemau, Hotepibre Qemau Siharnedjheritef and Iufni. He bases this conclusion on the double names borne by these pharaohs, which he believes are filiative nomina, i.e. names referring to one's parents. Hence the Ameny in Ameny Qemau would indicate that he was the son of Amenemhat V, then succeeded by his own son Hotepibre Qemau Siharnedjheritef as shown by the Qemau in his name. Similarly \\"Ameny Antef Amenemhat (VI)\\" would be a triple name meaning \\"Amenemhat, son of Antef, son of Ameny\\" possibly because his father was a certain \\"King's son Antef\\" attested on scarab seals dated on stylistic ground to the 13th Dynasty and who would himself be a son of Amenemhat V. Amenemhat VI's predecessor Iufni would also be part of this family although his precise relation to the other members cannot be settled due to the lack of material dating to his very short reign. Less than 10 years after Amenemhat VI's reign, a king named Renseneb Amenemhat took the throne. Following the same logic, he would be a son of a king Amenemhat who could possibly be Amenemhat VI or one of the intervening kings. Ryholt's analysis is contested by some Egyptologists as it relies on the unproven assumption that double names are necessarily filiative nomina.
