Zavod completed a music degree from the Melbourne Conservatorium, University of Melbourne in 1969. His talent as a pianist was recognised by Duke Ellington, who arranged for him to study at the Berklee College of Music, Boston ‚Äì where Zavod was later a professor of music. Zavod was based in the US for 20 years, where he played, toured and recorded. He scored more than 30 American and Australian films and television shows. His symphonic works have been performed by orchestras in Australia, Europe and the U.S. He composed the Environmental Symphony for orchestra, narrator and synchronized visuals which was performed at the 2010 Banksia Environmental Awards and narrated by Sir Richard Branson. The University of Melbourne awarded Zavod the Degree of Doctor of Music in recognition of his international achievements as a composer. Biography Zavod was classically trained at University of Melbourne Conservatorium after being awarded the prestigious full Ormond scholarship. In the late 1960s he was discovered by Duke Ellington, who arranged for him to further his jazz studies at famed Berklee College of Music, Boston, where Zavod taught. He spent the following 30 years in the US performing. He performed before the Queen and years later Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and recently Prince and Princess Norodom of Cambodia, heads of country and state, foreign dignitaries, government bodies, universities and charitable organizations in many countries. Zavod was also a studio musician with such artist as Jean Luc-Ponty, toured in Frank Zappa's band in 1984, and provided studio work on Zappa's release \\"Guitar\\".

The leader of the alliance is Sabra al- Qasemy al-Wasateyya, who was a former member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The alliance was founded after the 30 June ouster of Mohamed Morsi and subsequent attacks on civilians. The coalition has supported Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for president in the Egyptian 2014 presidential election. The Muslim Brotherhood has been criticized by the group for its calling for protests on the anniversary of the Mohamed Mahmoud clashes; the members of the alliance want the Brotherhood to turn away from violence. One of the members of the organization, Amr Emara, is also the coordinator of the Dissident Brotherhood Youth Alliance. The leader of the Democratic Jihad Party (Yasser Saad) is currently a member of the front.

It was the manufacturer's principal and often sole model for the next twenty years. The car's 1465 cc four-cylinder engine initially placed it in the 8CV car tax band, which would have placed it alongside lower-priced cars such as the Peugeot 301 and the Renault Monaquatre, but the Salmson's levels of technical sophistication and equipment, as well as its price, indicated that it was intended for a more aspirational clientele than these comparably sized cars. Within a few years the S4's four-cylinder engine had in any event increased in size to a point where the car sat in the 10CV car tax band, which moved the S4 up half a class as well as providing customers with a more convincing level of performance. The engines grew and the range widened. A 2.3-litre variant, the Salmson S4 E joined the less powerful car (by now itself having evolved into the Salmson S4 DA) in October 1937. The war disrupted production, which probably stopped completely after a major bomb attack conducted by the British on 3 March 1942. Post war production resumed (or continued), albeit at feeble levels, of the four-cylinder (10CV) Salmson S4-61 till April 1952, by which date production of the 13CV Salmson S4 E had already come to an end.  Origins  Salmson had emerged as an automobile manufacturer between 1919 and 1922, having already become well established in the aviation business,https://web.archive.org/web/20020118150334/http://amicale.salmson.free.fr/ initially as an aircraft manufacturer and specialising more recently in aircraft engines. Moving quickly beyond the British designed cyclecars, with which the post-war automobile business had started,Georgano, N.: Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile, London, 2000, during the mid-1920s the manufacturer specialised in small cars with technically advanced features such as a twin overhead camshaft and overhead valves for the car engines. In October 1928 the manufacturer had staged a surprise at the Motor Show, presenting the \\"Salmson Type S\\" with a small 6-cylinder 9 CV engine incorporating, as on Salmson's existing 4-cylinder engines, a twin overhead camshaft. From the outside the car could be distinguished from Salmson's existing 4-cylinder cars only by the \\"Six\\" logo in the centre of the front grill. The year before the Great Depression may not have been the best time for the manufacturer to push upmarket, and the \\"Type S\\" did not sell in huge numbers. It nevertheless can be seen as a precursor to the Salmson S4 that appeared (with a 4-cylinder engine) in 1932. The Salmson S4 both inherited and reinforced the company's strong technical reputation.  Model evolution = Salmson S4-C 8CV (1932‚Äì1934?)  A 1933 Salmson S4C faux cabriolet at Montlh√©ry The car was launched in the Autumn of 1932 with a 4-cylinder 1465 cc (8CV) engine for which a maximum output of at 3,800 rpm was claimed, supporting a listed top speed of 110 km/h (68 mph). The unit was unusual, for the time, in that it incorporated a twin overhead camshaft. It also used a dual-direction magneto coil that doubled as a starter motor, as well as a 12-volt electrical system. Power passed to the rear wheels using a classic 4-speed manual transmission. However, from May 1934 it became possible to specify, at extra cost, a \\"Cotal Preselector transmission\\".Frankenberg, Richard von; Neubauer, Otto: Geschichte des Automobils, K√ºnzelsau, , S. 181 Suspension was based on rigid axles front and back with longitudinal leaf springs, semi-elliptic at the front and attached using demi-cantilevers at the back. At the 27th Paris Motor show in October 1933 the car was priced by the manufacturer at 21,950 francs in bare chassis form. The manufacturer's inventiveness was more apparent under the bonnet than in respect of the body options, which were mostly at best conventional: the car incorporated a flat grill at the front, which by 1933 was perceived by some a little old fashioned. The wheelbase chassis was also offered with a selection of standard bodies that included a \\"faux cabriolet\\" 2-door four seater body priced at 29,900 francs, a four seater \\"coach lumineux\\" at 30,950 francs, a four door \\"berline\\" (sedan/saloon) at 31,650 francs, a sports bodied \\"roadster\\" at 31,450 francs and a \\"cabriolet\\" at 33,500 francs. Also listed was a \\"berline alongƒó\\" (lengthened sedan/saloon) at 31,950 francs.  Salmson S4-D 10CV (1934?‚Äì1936)  With the Salmson S4 D, introduced in 1934(?), the engine size was increased to 1596 cc. The tax horsepower ratio went up from 8 to 10 CV.  Salmson S4-DA 10CV (1936‚Äì1938)  In October 1936, with several thousand \\"Salmson S4 \\"s sold over the previous two years, the manufacturer used the Motor Show to launch a further upgrade. The four-cylinder engine retained its twin overhead camshafts, and the length of the piston stroke was unchanged, but a further increase in cylinder bore (diameter) provided for a further increase in capacity, now to 1731 cc. The cylinder head now featured hemispherical piston heads and centrally positioned spark plugs, which gave the engine a level of responsiveness not normally associated with a 10CV engine. The car shared its place in the 10CV tax band with the recently introduced Peugeot 302. Where comparably bodied versions existed, however, the Salmson S4 DA was nevertheless priced approximately 50% higher than the Peugeot 302: there was evidently no need for Salmson to compete on price with the volume automakers. By now the S4 had acquired independent front suspension, using a transverse leaf spring. The back wheels were, as before, attached to a rigid axle suspended with longitudinal leaf springs. At the 30th Paris Motor show in October 1936 the car was offered in bare chassis form at 24,000 francs. A four seater 2-door \\"coupƒó\\" bodied car was priced at 31,500 francs while the sedan/saloon bodied car ‚Äì now described not as a \\"berline\\" but with the more traditional term \\"conduite intƒórieur\\" came in at 32,800 francs. As before, the saloon/sedan bodied car had a sedate old fashioned appearance that offered no hint of the modern technology underneath. The \\"roadster\\" was priced at 35,500 francs and the four seater cabriolet at 35,900 francs. In every case, the price included a four-speed manual transmission (brought in from Delahaye), but for an extra 1,500 francs customers could specify a \\"Cotal Preselector transmission\\". In the immediate aftermath of the economic depression that hat hit western economies in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash, price inflation had gone into reverse and the domestic purchasing power of the French currency had begun to increase. The mid 1930s saw renewed economic paralysis in France, however, and during the second half of the decade price inflation returned with a vengeance. The Salmson S4-DA which the manufacturer had adverstized in bare chassis form for 24,000 francs in October 1936 was priced, in January 1938, at 31,200 francs: there were equivalent price increases for cars with bodies fitted.  Salmson S4 E 13CV (1937‚Äì1951)  The star of the Salmson stand at the 31st Paris Motor Show in October 1937 could have been the Salmson S4-E. The car's four-cylinder 2312 cc power unit extended the S4 range upwards, into the 13CV category. In fact, the car was placed at the far end of the stand without fanfare and without any accompanying publicity campaign, so that many visitors to the show likely missed it completely. The S4-E incorporated the technically advanced features of the S4 DA such as an engine with twin overhead camshaft, hemispherical piston heads with the centrally positioned spark plugs. The chassis featured rack and pinion steering, with independent suspension at the front. However, the front suspension was now refined through the addition of longitudinal torsion bars, an approach probably copied from the Citro√´n Traction that had appeared the year before. Commentators noted that the new engine and suspension enhancements gave rise to a combination of performance and road- holding that was among the best in class for the time. Another novelty for the S4-E was a hydraulically controlled brake circuit in place of the then conventional mechanical linkage. The wheelbase was extended by . Three standard bodies were offered. The \\"faux-cabriolet\\" (rebaptised \\"coup√©\\" in October 1938) 2-door four seater was listed in October 1937 at 49,800 francs. The berline, still listed as a \\"conduite-interieure\\" bodied car was priced at 50,900 francs. The rear doors on this car were hinged at the back: when two doors on the same side were opened there was no central pillar to impede access. The four-seater cabriolet was priced at 54,800 francs. As on the 4-cylinder S4-DA, customers were able to choose between a classic 4-speed manual transmission and a ‚ÄúCotal Preselector transmission\\", but whereas S4 DA customers were expected to pay an extra 2,000 francs for the Cotal option, the Cotal transmission was now offered at no additional cost to S4 E buyers.  Salmson S4-61 10CV (1938‚Äì1942, 1946‚Äì1952)  The Salmson S4-61 replaced the S4 DA for 1939. Technically very little changed. Second World War The technically sophisticated S4 was too complicated to interest the military and the manufacturer's Billancourt factory was too small to be listed for a switch-over to war production. Production seems to have been drastically scaled back, during the early years of the war, but sources are vague on the extent and nature of any manufacturing activity, which presumably was further inhibited by the British bombing of the plant on 3 March 1942. At the end of the war, however, it was single seater racing cars based on the chassis of the Salmson S4-61 that in 1945 were supplied for the activities of the \\"Union Sportif automobile\\" which launched a competition driving school in 1945. The venture did not endure beyond 1946, but the Salmson S4-61 was seen to have survived the war. Postwar Salmson S4 production 1946‚Äì1949 (S4-61 and S4-E combined totals): 1946 ‚Äì 75 1947 ‚Äì 143 1948 ‚Äì 336 1949 ‚Äì 835 In 1946 production of the S4 resumed, and it continued till 1952. Volumes were low, however, reflecting the dire state of the French economy. By 1950 volumes were beginning to recover, and even after the launch of a complementary model it is clear that many of the 817 Salmsons produced in 1951 will have been S4s. However, in 1951 the bank withdrew financial support from the company after which it was placed in a form of administration. Automobile production was run down, with the last S4s produced in April 1952.  British Salmson  The S4-C was also produced by British Salmson as a 12 HP model. Following the Great Depression Britain left the Gold Standard which for practical purposes involved a sudden and massive devaluation for the British currency. This boosted the British auto-industry, but it also meant that importing French cars to Britain was no longer profitable. By the time of the Second World War the British Salmson affiliate had developed local versions of the S4-D as well as a 6-cylinder S6-D (of which there was no French equivalent).http://www.britishsalmson.co.uk/ Sources and further reading  *Salmson.

It resulted from the death of the Labour Member of Parliament Harry Combs on 12 June 1954. Background In February 1954 Combs announced he would retire at the general election later that year owing to ill health. As a result, Labour had already prepared to replace him in the electorate and at the time of Combs' death, Henry May, a member of the Petone Borough Council, had already been selected as the Labour candidate. May's selection had been something of a surprise as the former Labour Party president James Roberts was the other candidate. The National Party decided not to stand a candidate as it had already selected Wilfred Fortune (the sitting MP for Eden) to contest Onslow at the upcoming general election. National wanted to avoid confusion by putting up a proxy candidate and likewise did not wish to cause a by-election in Eden should Fortune be victorious. The government intended it to coincide with the upcoming Patea by- election, even passing the Patea By-election Act 1954 to postpone it until the day of the Onslow by-election. Result As a general election was due towards the end of 1954 (and was held on 13 November), the nominated Labour candidate Henry May was not opposed, so was declared elected (from midday on 7 July 1954) when the writs closed for candidates. It marked the last time, to date, that a candidate for the House of Representatives has been returned unopposed. As May was declared elected when the writs closed on 7 July it rendered the government's attempt to have the Patea election held back until 31 July pointless. May first learned of his default victory via a telegram from Petone MP Mick Moohan inviting him to attend that evening's session of parliament. May did so and was sworn in as an MP that very evening. At the general election in November May defeated Fortune by 519 votes, confirming him as the MP.

During 1937 the sole example visited the United States and scored highest in the US National Soaring Competition. Design and development Although nominally a development of his earlier DFS Rh√∂nsperber, Hans Jacobs' Sperber Senior was a completely new design intended to improve on the performance of its predecessor and to accommodate larger pilots. It was a shoulder wing aircraft with a double straight tapered gull wing, built around two spars and fabric covered apart from the leading edge from the front spar forward and the wing roots, which were plywood skinned. The wing roots were carefully faired into the fuselage. The inner panels, filling about one third of the span had only slight taper, the sweep entirely on the trailing edge, and about 10¬∞ of dihedral. Outboard the taper was much stronger, with a taper ratio of 0.45. Here the leading edge was slightly swept but there was no dihedral. Ailerons occupied the whole of the outer panels' trailing edges. The Senior had a completely ply covered fuselage with a narrow ovoid cross section which was deep in the cockpit area but tapered progressively to the tail. The cockpit was just ahead of the wing, covered by a multipart glazing which, attached to a small area of the upper forward fuselage, hinged to the right for access. The rear of the canopy was above the fuselage line and a long, ply covered fairing reaching well behind the wing blended it in. A tapered, round tipped and largely fabric covered horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage, far enough forward to place the trailing edges of its elevators at the rudder hinge line. The latter was mounted on a narrow ply covered fin, carefully faired into the fuselage and extending below it to form a tail bumper. The mostly fabric covered rudder was full, curved and slightly pointed, likewise extending below the fuselage. A short skid from just behind the nose to beyond mid-chord completed the landing gear. Operational history The Sperber Senior first flew in 1936 and took part in the Rh√∂n German National championships of that year but its pilot, Ludwig Hofmann retired for personal reasons midway through. In 1937 Peter Riedel took it to the US to participate in the 8th American National Competitions at Elmira. He finished with the highest score but, not being a US citizen was denied the title of champion. Whilst in the US he made a seven-hour flight over central New York. After he returned to Germany the Sperber Senior was retired.

He started his professional music career in 2003 with Port Harcourt city based record label Tuck Tyght and released his first official single 'Learn Something'. His second single 'Can U Relate' showed his boldness and ability to address sensitive topics like Socio-political issues in Nigeria. Lyrikal has since become a voice for the gifted and the oppressed. Early life There is a certain restlessness that has characterised Lyrikal's journey as a musician and a man. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that he was born on the road to Aba, Abia; hails from Akwa Ibom state and spent his formative years in Sokoto. As the second and last child of a retired civil servant, Jesse relocated with his family in 1989 to Port Harcourt where his father was posted to serve. He received his primary and secondary school education in Port Harcourt and in 2005 he gained admission into The University of Lagos but dropped out a year later due to insufficient funds. Life in Lagos was hard, so he decided to return home to Port Harcourt where he tried to reorganise his priorities. Music career Lyrikal claims his inspiration for making music comes from being exposed to almost all genres of music especially reggae and disco during his early years. His early music influences were the likes of Madonna, Michael Jackson, Mc Hammer and Shabba Ranks. His love for rap music manifested when he saw the 1990 film House Party. Early 90s ‚Äì 2006 In the early 1990s young Lyrikal fell in love with Hip Hop and honed his skills in rapping, rhyming and song writing. He would later be influenced by the music and works of acts like Snoop Dogg (now Snoop Lion), Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur, Wu Tang Clan, and Nas whom he also happens to share the same birthday with, though ten years apart. In 2003, he began his career with Tuck Tyght, a rap label that housed some of the most celebrated rap talents at the time in Port Harcourt. Some of these talents were Mack Gee, Double K, Andre Blaze, The Veteran and Damage. His contribution to the Port Harcourt City classic album \\"Now Official\\" could not be ignored as he slowly cemented his place in the Port Harcourt music scene. 2006 ‚Äì 2010 By 2006, Jesse went on a solo campaign with \\"The Escalator Project\\", during which he recorded over thirty songs, but his attempt to release the project was futile as he had neither the proper management nor funds to do this. He however released a number of singles that did well in the local scenery but did not get the nationwide recognition he had hoped for. He continued on this path, making a name and gaining respect amongst his peers but still struggled to make the cross he desired. 2010 ‚Äì 2013 In late 2010 however, Lyrikal moved on to Xcel Music, ironically the same label that housed Specimen A and M-Trill, who Lyrikal had dissed in the past. He has since recorded over a hundred songs, his debut project was released in 2013 titled \\"R.M.F.A.O (Rappin' My Fuckin' Ass Off)\\" a mixed tape which received huge critical reviews. 2014 Lyrikal is currently promoting the release of his second mixtape titled \\"OCD: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder On 6 January 2014 he released 'Focused'; the first official single off the OCD mixtape. Subsequently, he released his covers to Pound Cake by Drake, Tom Ford by Jay-Z and Rap God by Eminem. Nearly thirteen years since beginning his musical career and successfully moulding the hip hop scene in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, Lyrikal is only now working on his first official album to be released later in 2015. Behind Bars Campaign In January 2014, Lyrikal embarked on a campaign to inspire young Nigerians towards a more proactive engagement with both their personal development and national development. On 16 January 2014 he released a photo series of himself online behind prison bars. Each photograph was captioned with thought provoking quotes from Lyrikal himself, Nelson Mandela, William Glasser, Henri Matisse and a few others. The photos were featured on different blogs across the African continent and stimulated conversations relating to social participation in national development and the general creativity behind the photo campaign. Inside the press release, Lyrikal explained; \\"Hip Hop is a form of self-expression that tries to challenge or merely evoke the mood of the circumstances of an environment. The bars are a metaphorical play on the musical jargon; where they represent a point in a verse which contains the punchline for a rap ‚Äì this is why we used sixteen photos. But most importantly, the bars represent the physical oppression, mental captivity and creative limitations facing the Nigerian youth today \\" Discography *2013: RMFAO (mixtape) *2014: O.C.D (mixtape) Collaborations *2018: Di Party Lit (Feat.

Distribution and habitat Americamysis almyra is native to shallow parts of the western Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Its range extends from Maryland to Florida and the whole Gulf of Mexico, and includes the brackish waters of Lake Pontchartrain, St. Andrews Bay and Chesapeake Bay. Its habitat is typically seagrass meadows and shallow marshy areas at depths of less than . It is tolerant of salinities ranging from 0 to 30 psu (practical salinity units) but is usually found in areas with a salinity below 20 psu. Americamysis almyra was first described from Lake Pontchartrain from specimens collected in 1953. It was identified as being present in St. Johns River Florida in 1977 and was first detected in the Patapsco River flowing into Chesapeake Bay in 1980. It is unclear whether it had invaded these areas, perhaps in the ballast water of ships, or whether it had been there previously but had been misidentified as Americamysis bigelowi. Ecology Americamysis almyra is an omnivore and examination of its stomach contents showed that its diet includes 31% vascular plant debris and 11% copepods and diatoms.

He was the starting forward on the Bruins' national championship team in 1964, when he served as co-captain along with Walt Hazzard. Hirsch also earned all-conference honors that season. He later became an assistant coach in college, and served as the top assistant to Hazzard. Hazzard and Hirsch coached at UCLA from 1984 to 1988. Hirsch was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2012. Early life Hirsch grew up in Brooklyn in an affluent Jewish family. His father ran a successful chain of bowling alleys. Hirsch attended a school of predominantly black students, and he played basketball on the asphalt courts of the Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant neighborhood. His family moved to the Los Angeles district of Van Nuys when he was 14. In his senior year at Van Nuys High School, the center won All-City Co-Player of the Year honors. College career After high school, Hirsch attended junior college at Los Angeles Valley College for two years from 1959 to 1961, where he was a two- time All-Metropolitan Conference player. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a favor to his father, who promised to quit his five-packs-a-day smoking habit. Hirsch played for the Bruins from 1961 to 1964, starting at forward in his last two seasons. In 1963‚Äì64, the Bruins won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship, coach John Wooden's first title and the beginning of a UCLA dynasty that would claim nine of the next 11 championships. Recognizing Hirsch's defensive skills, Wooden assigned him to their opponent's top player. Hirsch served as co-captain of the team along with Walt Hazzard, and he earned first-team All-AAWU honors that season. In 1994, the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Hirsch has become the least-known member of the starting five from 1963‚Äì64.\\" In 1991 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

Walnut Valley is a historic plantation house and archaeological site located near Highgate, Surry County, Virginia. The property includes a plantation house (c. 1770), a frame slave quarter (1816), a frame kitchen (1816), seven contributing 19th- and 20th-century agricultural and domestic outbuildings and structures, and an archaeological site. The house is a 1 1/2-story, four-bay, double-pile, side-gabled frame house on a brick foundation. It measures 40 feet, 4 inches, by 30 feet, 5 inches and features Federal style decorative elements. The one-story, two-bay frame slave quarter measures 14 feet by 16 feet, and is clad in weatherboard. The contributing outbuildings include a late-19th century storehouse and a granary, well house, silo, and three chicken houses. The property was conveyed to the Commonwealth of Virginia for the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation on January 14, 2004. and Accompanying six photos It is now contained within Chippokes Plantation State Park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.  History  Walnut Valley Plantation was established in 1636 when William Newsum, Jr. was granted 550 acres of land in Surry County, Virginia. Newsum was an English colonist who had paid for eleven other colonists to travel to Virginia, a practice which carried the promise of land from the English Crown. For each person whose passage was paid, the colonist who paid for it would receive 50 acres of land. Out of the eleven people Newsum brought to Virginia, he is known to have married three (possibly four) of them. These women were Penelope Ramsey, Sarah Fisher, Elizabeth Wilson, and Gertrude. Gertrude was Newsum's final wife, outliving him. Newsum may have left Walnut Valley to William Batte, a non-relative, in order to pay off debts. Batte sold the plantation to Ralph Jones in 1657. An unrelated Jones, James Jones, had come to own Walnut Valley by 1704. The house was built by James' son or grandson, both named Richard Jones, around 1770. In 1806, Richard Jones, Jr. died without heir, and instead left the plantation to his unrelated overseer, William Jones. William, by a strange coincidence, was a distant relative of William Batte, and would own Walnut Valley for the next three decades. The 1810 census recorded fourteen enslaved individuals at Walnut Valley Plantation. The remaining slave quarter and detached kitchen were added by William Jones in 1816, during a period of growth for the farm. Jones' operation included oxen, mules, cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, and turkeys. The surrounding fields were planted in cotton, corn, and peas, and cordwood provided late-season income. Like many plantations in Surry County, Walnut Valley also produced peach and apple brandy, and featured orchards, a cider press, apple mill, and distillery. Under Jones' management, Walnut Valley exploded in productivity, due in large part to the enslaved labor force he maintained. By Jones' death in 1833, thirty enslaved workers toiled on his plantation. Jones' son, Bolling Green Jones, inherited the plantation, as well as guardianship of his two younger siblings, William C. and Minerva. Their mother, Ann, had passed away sometime in the decade previous. Bolling Jones continued his father's agricultural practices, notably amending the soil with lime in the form of marl from nearby fossil deposits. This improved crop yield by 25-100%, making Bolling Jones a wealthy man. He added seven more enslaved laborers to his workforce, valued at over $20,000 when Bolling died in 1855. Bolling Jones' widow, Henrietta Edwards Jones, was left in control of Walnut Valley, with the provision that after her death the property would be conveyed to Bolling's two younger siblings. Minerva and William, however, felt that if they waited out the rest of their sister-in-law's natural life, their inheritance would depreciate in value. For this reason, the two petitioned the court of Surry County to allow them to take ownership of Henrietta's property, and in 1858 they were successful. Minerva and her husband, Blair Pegram, bought out William's share, and the Pegrams took up residence at Walnut Valley. Nothing is known of what became of Henrietta Jones. The Pegrams experienced the Civil War while living at Walnut Valley. Despite this, archaeological evidence found during renovations in 2017 indicates that they were still able to purchase new dishes and furniture during the war years. After the war, the Pegrams' wealth, largely tied up in human chattel, drastically decreased. The fact that Blair Pegram had paid for his share of the house using Confederate currency caused legal issues well into the 1880s. Sometime between 1865 and 1870, the east chimney caught fire and fell away from the house. The Pegrams extended the house five feet and replaced the original chimney with a haphazardly-constructed, small, square chimney intended for use with a coal stove. By 1904, maintaining Walnut Valley had become too much of a financial strain, and Minerva Pegram leased the property to a tenant farmer named George Washington Mitchell. Mitchell, his wife Francis, and their descendants continued to occupy Walnut Valley through many changes in ownership. In 1916, Minerva Pegram died, leaving the property to her daughters, May Jones and Carrie Warren. By 1920, both women had passed away, leaving ownership of Walnut Valley to Carrie's son, Walker Pegram Warren. Warren and his wife, Violet, also owned neighboring Bacon's Castle and resided in Smithfield, Virginia. During their ownership, Walnut Valley's main products were peanuts and hogs. Three generations of the Mitchell family farmed and lived at Walnut Valley during the Warrens' half-century of ownership. When the Warrens died with no heirs in a car accident in 1972, Walnut Valley was sold at auction. W.W. Reasor of the Reasor Corporation, a Virginia Beach development company, bought the plantation. Despite rumored plans to construct houses on the parcel, Reasor continued to lease the land to the Mitchells until his death in 1999. His widow, Lucy Reasor, donated Walnut Valley Plantation to the State of Virginia in 2004, when it joined Chippokes Plantation State Park, with which it had shared a border. Descendants of the Mitchell family continued to farm the land until 2016. The 1816 Walnut Valley slave quarter, one of the oldest remaining slave quarters in Virginia. Today, Walnut Valley Plantation and its two 1816 outbuildings (the slave quarter and the detached kitchen) have been carefully restored. The Walnut Valley House is now overnight accommodations available for rental through the park. It is fully accessible for persons with disabilities, as are the restored outbuildings.

History A manor house existed in Berden in medieval times when the Rochford family were lords of the manor here and probably founded the nearby priory. In 1583 it passed to Sir Thomas Ramsey who gave the estate and priory to the mayor of London and governors of several hospitals. The current red brick house is Elizabethan, built in the 1580s.

Further additions were made in the 17th century when it was owned by the Meade family, and the rainwater heads bear the date 1655. In the 1780s Thomas Hawkes owned Berden Hall, and in 1801 it still belonged to the Hawkes family. Berden Hall became a Grade II* listed building on 26 November 1951.

The house has three straight gables to each side and mullion-and-transom-cross windows, dated to the 17th century. There is a triple arch at the central doorway to the house, and inside is a winding wide Tudor staircase. The house has eight bedrooms, one of which is a master suite with two dressing rooms, a reception hall, drawing room, sitting room, dining room, kitchen, utility room, cloakroom, five bathrooms, two studies, a snooker room, a squash and tennis court and an indoor swimming pool, and outer staff buildings and stable block.

Company website. Retrieved October 6, 2013. Largely good reviews greeted the film from critics, its festival audience and general audiences alike. The film seeks to build bridges between Asian and American cultures, producing horror with a blend of both.  Plot  The story in Darkest Night unfolds as a Found footage (pseudo-documentary) \\"documentary\\" by a Filipino television journalist, Danny Valencia (Jonas Gruet). In what are purportedly his words, Danny writes that he created the film from videotape found at the site of a 2003 unsolved crime. The opening scene shows him and some workmen at the crime site, ruins of a mansion where a family disappeared. Then, the video begins. On December 25, 2003, Michelle Espino (Issa Litton) and her husband, David (Allan Dale Alojipan), host their upscale family's Christmas Day reunion at their mansion in the mountains. Susan (Anne Gauthier) and American Ken Tyler (DJ Perry) are engaged after dating for months in Manila. They travel to the Espinos' home with Susan's live-in sister, Chelsea (Jill Palencia). When they arrive, Susan announces the engagement to the entire family and introduces Ken. An autistic cousin, Justin, a video camera savant, takes over videotaping from then on. (See Autism and Savant syndrome.) After dinner, a mild earthquake jolts everyone, and the power goes out, plunging all into darkness. Everyone realizes that all batteries and electricity are useless except for Justin's video camera. A dense fog surrounds the mansion and the entire area. David goes out, walking toward a neighbor's house to seek information. Later, the television switches on by itself without power, showing a strange pagan ritual congregation with weird singing. Now more frightened, the family members try to guard each other. After several other family members die or disappear, Susan finds an old book bearing the French title ‚ÄúThe Way of Baphomet\\" and the motto Ensemble Toujours (Together Always). Soon, only Michelle, Steven, Susan and Ken are left. They realize the time is 9 am, and it's still dark outside. Susan discovers the French words Ensemble Toujours written on a wall. An upset Michelle rushes outside, finding a prowler. She shoots him, only to find David's grotesquely deformed body. Michelle then shoots herself dead. Later, Susan, Ken and Steven gather in the kitchen. She shows them the old \\"[Baphomet]\\" book and demands an explanation from Steven. He tells them Michelle was into black magic, and the book was her \\"Bible.\\" She was able to learn powerful magic spells from the it. Many years ago, a cult from France worshiped the demon god Baphomet and practiced black magic on this very land. They all mysteriously disappeared on Christmas Day 1914. Steven confesses he and Michelle also had an affair. Michelle later told him she had found an easy way to ascend magically into \\"heaven\\" along with the whole family. Earlier, she had cast a spell on everyone there. However, these rites actually required human sacrifice, mutilation and torture. When Michelle realized her \\"god\\" had deceived her, she killed herself. Susan reads from the book that in the final rite a man and woman must wed, and then the bride has to castrate her groom. Trying to break the magic spell, Susan leads them all in a seance, calling on Michael and requesting release. Michael appears and goes to Steven. Both disappear. Finally, Susan finds that Ken is dead too, and only she is left. She places her engagement ring on his finger with a ring she gave him. Then he vanishes like all the others. The television flickers on again. They see the pagan cult robed in white, gathering outdoors around an altar. Before all, Ken and Michelle make love. She proceeds to castrate him as a human sacrifice. The set then shows a picture of the entire family, robed and near the altar, without Susan and Justin. The scene slowly dissolves. A robed Susan and Justin now stand with the rest of the family. In the final scene the journalist, Danny, is still among the original ruins with the work crew, as at first. Everyone gathers by a box they had found, and inside is the old French book, ‚ÄúThe Way of Baphomet.\\" On top of the book are the two rings together, Susan's and Ken's.

In fact,\\" he added, \\"My nightmares never look like a 15 million-dollar production.\\"Surviving the Night, Chapter 14 , Williams, GPI Press, Los Angeles, 2013. Nightmares portray some of our most deeply held fears, especially about family, according to the famous American horror observer, Joseph Maddrey. For example, he explains the huge appeal of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise (1984 original directed by Wes Craven) as a result of its exploiting these fears.Nightmares in Red, White and Blue: The Evolution of the American Horror Film, pp. 165-169ff, Joseph Maddrey, MacFarland Company, Inc., Jefferson, NC-US & London, UK 2004, . In Darkest Night Williams and the director, Noel Tan, draw a direct line from ultra- realistic cin√©ma v√©rit√© style into terrifying childhood-type nightmares, disjointed time, claustrophobia, bad family relationships and twisted ghosts from the past. The result is a formula for heart-sick, demoralizing fear. During the film, although supernatural dangers abound, the viewer slowly realizes that the film's story is about a desperate, truly dysfunctional family. Loved ones sought to rely on in a crisis instead lash out, buckle or commit outright betrayal.The Demons Behind Darkest Night documentary film, GPI, 2012. After the earthquake, and the lights go out, the film crosses over from ordinary life, into increasingly dread-filled dark scenarios.  Based on Malaysian 'Urban Legend'  After moving to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in May 2010, Williams sought to produce a film there based on an older Horror film screenplay he had previously written, titled Out of Time. This script was about an isolated family that fell prey to black magic induced by a family member. After coming across a Malaysian urban legend type ghost story, he decided to combine the subject matter of the script with this story. The local legend tells the story of a Chinese family that mysteriously disappeared in the Malaysian Cameron Highlands on February 1, 2003, during the night of a Chinese New Year celebration.\\"Your Ghost Stories\\" (Malaysian), \\"Ghost Encounter at Ruins of Old Mansion.\\" Retrieved on October 7, 2013. Williams investigated this story and interviewed, either by himself or through assistants, more persons in Malaysia to gather as much information as he could about this seemingly government-suppressed ghost story.Reviews & Ratings for Darkest Night, the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved October 8, 2013. As Williams learned more about this legend, he discovered many similarities between the plot of Out of Time and the reported stories of the \\"disappeared\\" family. In personal interviews with the press, Williams does not assert that Darkest Night is based on a true story. However, he has said he believes the Malaysian story is a valid account.Surviving the Night, Chapters 11, 12 & 14 , Williams, GPI Press, Los Angeles, 2013. Also he makes no claims about the authenticity of local tales of ghosts that supposedly inhabit the actual ruins and locale where the Malaysian family disappeared. When asked, Williams refuses to give the name of the family in this urban legend, citing privacy concerns for family members still living in parts of the country. As a part of his interests in pagan religion and Gothic fiction, Williams had long been studying the Middle Ages-originated Baphomet mythology and related pagan mythologies. He did extensive research into the various historic Baphomet and similar cults to provide additional background for the story of Darkest Night.Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall (1818). Mysterium Baphometis revelatum: Fundgruben des Orients (Vienna) 6: 1‚Äì120; 445‚Äì99. The religious, magical and ritualistic elements of the plot were taken from various beliefs of these cults, especially the Druid elements, as well as the occult-influenced black magic writings of Aleister Crowley.Crowley, Aleister; Mary. Desti, Leila. Waddell (2004). Magick: Liber ABA, Book Four, Parts I-IV. Hymenaeus. Beta (ed.). York Beach, Me.: S. Weiser. . According to Williams, historical Baphomet-related ideas and images are a vital part of the film's story and visuals.\\"The Baphomet Cult & His Followers Through Their Long History\\" in the film's Official Website. Retrieved October 5, 2013. This Web page contains an in-depth, original article about the Baphomet cult, starting with ancient Egypt down to the present, including citing its own sources.  Move to Philippines  The film-making climate of Malaysia proved unsuitable to filming there because of arbitrary government film censorship, so Williams decided to film Darkest Night on locations in the Philippines. This action, of course, required some location-related rewriting of the script. The Chinese characters in the story became Filipino, and the Chinese New Year became Christmas. The characters and general family dynamic in the story remained the same, and the author only made changes necessary to accommodate a different culture, race and nationality. As a result, the final version of the Darkest Night screenplay came about.  Production, Premieres and Release  Darkest Night is the first film from Gothic Pictures International (credited in the film as Gothic Productions International, the company's previous name; see \\"External Links\\" below), an independent film company now based in Los Angeles.\\"Quality Gothic & Horror Filmmaking: International Style,\\" Gothic Pictures International company website.

Retrieved October 7, 2013. A small group of American and Filipino film-makers met in Manila during late 2010 for the purpose of founding this company and producing Darkest Night. Russ Williams and Noel Tan, the film's director who is a native of the Philippines, were the co-founders of the company and went on to supervise the making of the film.Surviving the Night, Introduction , Williams, GPI Press, Los Angeles, 2013. Darkest Night was produced in cooperation with the Michigan company, Collective Development, Inc. (see \\"External Links\\" below).Collective Development, Inc. Retrieved October 9, 2013.  Production and Reported Apparitions  Tan and Williams worked together closely on this production from January to May 2011. Pre-production began in January, and they were able to put together a cast and crew to shoot the film by late April 2011. Shooting for the film began on May 2 and lasted 10 days, mostly in and around a rural mansion in Floridablanca, Pampanga in Luzon, where the entire production group lived together during that time.Surviving the Night, Chapter 1 , Williams, GPI Press, Los Angeles, 2013. There were many reports of supernatural events happening in the house during the shooting of Darkest Night, including local stories that the house was actually haunted. For example, while working on the film the film's star, DJ Perry, showed others deep scratches on his back, saying they were from an unseen entity.Surviving the Night, Chapter 11 , Williams, GPI Press, Los Angeles, 2013.\\"Surviving the Night,\\" Darkest Night Official Website. Retrieved October 10, 2013. See this site for photos. These scratches were documented by photographs purported to be real. Other cast and crew members claimed that they saw ghostly presences while the house was darkened and quiet during the ten-day film shoot.  Post-Production  Post-production for Darkest Night lasted about one year, from June 2011 to June 2012 and took place in Manila. Work on this phase of production was delayed and severely hampered by strange events during this entire time. For example, all of the film's later dialog dubbing (ADR recordings, see dubbing (filmmaking)) mysteriously disappeared at one point and were never found. Also, much of the visual effects (VFX) footage and original sound effects recording, as well as footage of several chroma key screen shoots, all simply vanished. These types of disappearances plagued the film's Post-production almost continually. Currently, only the rough cut sequence choices from the Darkest Night original video take footage plus a few brief visual effects sequences and outtake footage remain accounted for. All other additional footage from the film, digital audio and video, is lost. No one has been able to account for these strange losses associated with the film. The final budget for Darkest Night was reportedly estimated at $125,000 USD.Darkest Night at the Internet Movie Database, under \\"Box Office.\\" Retrieved October 7, 2013. At this time, there are no figures for the film's gross receipts.  Film Premieres  On November 16, 2011, there was a private premiere of Darkest Night in Manila for cast and crew plus their friends and relatives. Again mysterious losses plagued the film, and the director was forced to show an inferior rough cut of the film because no finished video could be found. The release dates for the film were seriously delayed while another post-production phase during 2012 was required before the producers had a fully finished version of the film. Finally, Darkest Night had its U.S. premiere at the FACINE International Film Festival in San Francisco on October 20, 2012.\\"Horror Will Never Be the Same Again ...

It is one of the best preserved Romanesque churches in the province of Uppland. . Not far from the church is the site of the Viking Era memorial B√∂ksta Runestone (B√∂kstastenen). History and architecture The oldest parts of Balingsta Church, the nave, choir and apse, date from the end of the 12th century. A few years later the tower was added to the church. The vestry was built in the 15th century, and during the same century the church ceiling was remade into a vaulted ceiling, decorated with frescos, of which only fragments remain. In the 16th century the church tower was heightened and a church porch added. The church was again rebuilt in the 18th century, when new and larger windows were inserted and the presently visible lantern was added to the tower. The church has remained more or less unchanged since. During the 19th century, the church was in a state of decay and in 1872 the congregation moved out of the church into a new church not far away. The medieval church was left abandoned. However, already in 1917 the congregation decided to restore the old church and move back; substantial restoration works were carried out under the leadership of architect Sigurd Curman (1879-1966) and the congregation moved back in 1919. In 1934, the 19th- century church was pulled down. The church is built of partly whitewashed fieldstone. It is a hall church ending in a choir with an apse. On the south fa√ßade the church porch protrudes and on the north, the vestry. Inside, the church still has some iron chandeliers dating from the Middle Ages.

It stars Ewan McGregor, Tye Sheridan, Ciar√°n Hinds and Ayelet Zurer. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2015, and began a limited theatrical release on May 13, 2016.  Plot  Jesus walks through the desert, while stopping to pray and asking where God is. He encounters an old woman to whom he gives water, before noticing she has a snake tail, and she laughs at him. Throughout the film, Satan appears to Jesus, adopting his appearance. He offers Jesus water, but he doesn't reply. Eventually Jesus finds a boy taking care of his mother in a tent. The boy is building a home with his father for him to live, although he wishes to go to Jerusalem. The mother is dying of an unspecified cause, since she can not eat. The father gives food to Jesus, but he refuses, saying he is fasting. Jesus leaves, but soon returns and works with them building the house, while he stays at his tent. Satan poses as the mother, wanting Jesus to believe that the boy is product of an infidelity. Satan reveals to Jesus that he can see the future, and that the world is one more iteration of history, which God always tries again while changing some details. Satan reveals that whenever Jesus intervenes, he can not predict the outcome. Jesus asks Satan how is to be in God's presence, and Satan explains an abstract feeling, while saying God has no face. Later, Satan adopts the figure of the naked mother, and tells Jesus that he is weak. The boy develops a taste in inventing riddles, which Jesus enjoys. His father discovers a red rock (possibly ruby) in a cliff, and plans to lower the boy with ropes while he and Jesus hold him, so he can get it. The boy refuses, and the father attacks him. Jesus offers himself to be the one to descend, but the father does it, while Jesus and the boy hold him. The father falls and demands the rope to be cut. Jesus and the boy go to look for him, but he dies from his injuries. Jesus returns with the body so the mother can see him. Jesus and the boy later find the body being burned. The boy gets some of his father's ashes, and his mother tells him to leave her. The boy leaves, and Jesus demands Satan to show him his destiny. Jesus watches it in a bowl of water, and smiles. He attempts to heal the mother, but she refuses. Jesus leaves to Jerusalem. In the way, Satan tells him that he's tired of walking, and that in his final moments he will offer Jesus help. He tells Jesus to say hello to God when he sees him. The film jumps to Jesus' crucifixion. Dying, Jesus sees a Hummingbird in front of him. The apostles then bury Jesus' body, and stay outside of his tomb. In the present day, two tourists take pictures in the same desert Jesus walked in.  Cast  * Ewan McGregor as Jesus(Yeshua) and Satan * Tye Sheridan as Son * Ciar√°n Hinds as Father * Ayelet Zurer as Mother  Production  On February 1, 2014, the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki told Deadline that he is going to work on a film in the desert with his friend Rodrigo Garc√≠a and Ewan McGregor. He said \\"It's a tiny little beautiful, extraordinary script that Rodrigo wrote that we‚Äôre going to shoot for five weeks.\\" On February 5, 2014 two actors, Ewan McGregor and Tye Sheridan, joined the film cast. McGregor plays the dual roles of a holy man and a demon. The film is written and directed by Rodrigo Garc√≠a, while Division Films and Mockingbird Pictures produced the film.

Trigg offered defence by disabling Turner, but after a Pratt attempt to shoot Trigg‚Äôs father with a double-barrelled gun, both father and son made to escape. Pratt, using the words \\"Now, damn your heart, I will do for you\\", then shot Trigg in the chest, killing him.

It comprises a chancel, nave, north and south transepts, a west tower and a south porch, and is of Early English and Perpendicular style. The roofs are red tiled throughout. The church's 15th-century three- stage tower is of Gothic Perpendicular style. Of approximately square in footprint, the bottom stage contains a door and window on its west face. The restored 15th-century door, faced with decorative hinges, is set within a chamfered arch topped by a rectilinear enclosure; between this and the arch are spandrels with inset rosettes containing quatrefoils. Around the top of the squared surround is a rectilinear hood mould. Above the door is a restored 15th-century Perpendicular pointed arch window set within a chamfered reveal. The window is of three lights up to the outer arch spring, each ending in a trefoil-headed arch. Above the lights is panel tracery--a Perpendicular style of upright straight openings above lower lights--leading to further arches. Around the window opening arch is a hood mould. The second tower stage west side, slightly set back, contains a narrow arrowslit window rebated within an arch, possibly 15th-century. Above the apex of the window opening is a small round stone with a carved diagonal cross inset. On the south face is a c. 2000 tower clock; circular, convex, and with gold numerals. The belfry third stage, set back again, contains a restored 15th-century window opening on all sides, all of two lights with trefoil heads, louvred, and ending in a flattened pointed arch with hood mould. The tower parapet is deeply embattled. Inset behind the battlements is a four-sided pyramid stub spire. An angled buttress runs almost to the height of the first stage at the nave ends of the north and south sides--English Heritage states there are no tower buttresses. From the bases of the buttresses is a simple moulded socle (plinth) topped by a cill band--angled projection that allows water to flow from a building face-- running around the tower.Trapmore, Mark; \\"Berden - St Nicholas Church\\", The Recorders of Uttlesford History. Retrieved 24 May 2014 The nave is approximately east to west and north to south. The north side contains a 19th- century window with arched lancets and a twin-stepped angle buttress. Running off the nave south side is the 1868 porch, with door set within a deeply rounded arch opening with a following hood mould above. On both east and west sides is a small twin-light window with ogee trefoiled head arches within a rectilinear frame. The porch roof is steeply pitched and surmounted by a cross of Celtic appearance. Within the porch, to the right of the nave door opening is a 15th-century stoup with worn basin within a pointed recess. Immediately to the east of the porch is three-light flat-arched window with cinquefoil heads, dated to the 15th century with reused 13th-century material. Attached between the nave and chancel are north and south transepts. The north transept is east to west, and north to south. It has a 19th-century window of three lights below tracery on both the east and north walls, both within a 14th- century opening. To the west of the north window is a 13th-century arched doorway, above which is a small niche with trefoil head. The south transept is east to west, and north to south. It contains on its east side a restored 14th-century window with ogee-headed twin lights and tracery within a square head. The south wall 14th-century window is of ogee-headed twin lights and tracery with an arch surround and hood mould. The south transept has twin- stepped diagonal buttresses. The Chancel is east to west, and north to south. The east chancel window, part of the 1868 restoration, is of three lights, the centre light running to the chamfered window arch, the outer lights running to the window arch spring. The mullions have three part circular shafts as dressing sitting on moulded bases, topped with floriated capitals. Above the two outer lights are quatrefoil rosettes set within fields of filigree style. A hood mould joins a 19th-century horizontal cill band, which runs across the wall face and continues in stepped fashion across east wall corner twin- stepped angle buttresses, and around the north and south chancel walls. The north and south chancel windows are of the same style, but of two lights. The north wall also contains a further c. 1270 single-lancet arched window, and an arched door way of the same date with the arch surrounded by a hood mould with personified carved label stops. Interior Nave and chancel from tower arch The church walls and ceilings are rendered and painted white throughout. All windows are glazed with translucent rectilinear glass panels, in clear, red or blue. All flooring is plain red tiling except on the raised chancel sanctuary behind the altar rail where there is added bands of black, white and brown. The chancel east window is part of the 19th-century restoration, but with the use of a c. 1270 capital detail. The c. 1270 chamfered rebated chancel arch has a hood mould finished with human head label stops on both chancel and nave sides. Set within the arch is a further chamfered arch supported by responds--half-piers attached to walls supporting an arch--of semi-circular columns with flat-face faceted moulded bases, and foliate capitals that have been part-restored. A 19th-century-added arched squint is on each side of the chancel arch, each with a chamfered rebate as part of the arch. Set above each squint on the chancel side is a gable as moulding with, at its spring and point, a carved foliated detail. Within the chancel is a 14th-century piscina containing a quatrefoil shaped drain. Chancel arch with squint niches The north transept (or Priory End) windows, east and north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with tie beam support added in the 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof trussing is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the ridge beam is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c. 20th-century panels and doors rising part way to the top of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above. The nave is 13th century in origin, but was rebuilt in the 14th. At the west of the north wall is part of a 12th-century window, now blocked and not visible outside, abutted to the tower wall. The north wall window is 19th century within a 14th-century opening. At the east of the nave is an arch leading to the north transept. This chamfered arch was reused when the nave was widened in the 14th century, and is supported by semi-octagonal responds added in the 19th. The nave south wall arch to the south transept is 13th century, chamfered, with square responds. Between this transept arch and east wall is a blocked 15th-century doorway that led to the loft above a former rood screen. The part-restored south three-light window is late 15th century, but using some material from the 13th. To the west of the window is the south doorway with moulded arch and hood mould. Between the south door and the tower wall is part of a 12th- century window, blocked, as mirror image to that on the north wall. At the west of the nave within the tower arch is the 1780 church organ with part of a 15th-century three-panelled screen set in front as part of the organist‚Äôs chair--this screen may have come from neighbouring Berden Hall. Within the nave against the north wall of the chancel arch is an octagonal oak pulpit with ornamented panelling taken from an earlier 17th-century pulpit. Behind the pulpit on the chancel arch west face is inscribed, in Lomardic capitals, a mason inscription: ‚ÄúGefrai Limathun‚Äù (Geoffrey the Mason). The church octagonal font sits at the west of the nave central to the tower arch, and is plain and painted white, with a plain octagonal wood cover on which sits a floral display. Tower bells are one each by W. and P. Wightman (1695); J. Keene (possibly 1613); Robert Oldfield (1613); and Thomas Newman of Cambridge. Church plate includes a 17th-century repouss√© silver-gilt paten, with the inscription \\"Berden Parish, 1768.\\" A 1602 silver-gilt cup with coat of arms, originally secular--a cup not initially made for the church--is of pear shape with a chased bowl, a twisted stem, and a steeple-top cover.

There are eight plates: one each of an image of a man and woman in Elizabethan dress; two with inscriptions; one depicting their nine sons; one their four daughters; and at the head one shield of arms each over Thomas and An. On the opposite south- east side is an engraved stone slab to the memory of Dame Mary Scott with, at the top, three coat of arms in lozenge format. Dame Mary died 1678 aged 89 years, and was the daughter of John Aldersey of Aldersey Hall, Cheshire, who was a haberdasher in London--the Alsersey family were the first inhabitants of Berden Hall. She was first married to Thomas Westrowe, a London alderman and grocer. Their son, Thomas Westrow, was an MP for Hythe in the Long Parliament and the Rump Parliament, and was a militia captain in the parliamentary forces. Mary Scott's second marriage, in 1630, was to Sir Norton Knatchbull of Mersham Hatch in Kent.History of Parliament Online - Knatchbull, Sir Norton, 1st Baronet Her third husband was Sir Edward Scott of Scotts Hall at Nettlestead, Kent whom she married after being a widow for 35 years.\\"Thomas Westrow - Parliamentarian soldier and MP\\", The Twickenham Museum.

When he came to Azerbaijan, however, the commanders of the fortresses refused to surrender to him, recognizing instead Marzuban's son Justan I ibn Marzuban I as his successor. Unable to establish his rule in the province, Wahusdan returned to Tarum; Justan was recognized as ruler in Azerbaijan, with his brother Ibrahim I ibn Marzuban I made governor of Dvin. Justan seems to have been interested primarily in his harem, a fact which alienated some of his supporters, although he and Ibrahim successfully put down a revolt by a grandson of the caliph al-Muktafi in 960. Shortly afterwards Justan and another brother, Nasir, came to Tarum, where they were treacherously imprisoned by Wahsudan, who sent his son Ismail ibn Wahsudan to take over Azerbaijan. Ibrahim raised an army in Armenia to oppose Ismail, prompting Wahsudan to execute Justan, his mother and Nasir. Ibrahim was driven out of Azerbaijan by Ismail, but retained his rule in Dvin.

At this stage it was the end point of the Clackline railway. The Newcastle‚ÄìBolgart Railway was the second stage of the Clackline‚ÄìMiling railway. It was opened on 6 December 1909 by the Western Australian Premier Newton Moore. The line ran between Newcastle (now Toodyay) and Bolgart, Western Australia. The line came about after community support rallied against the Government, who were seen as not approving the rail to reduce the value of the Midland Railway Company land holdings. At a meeting on 6 November 1906 local MLA Timothy Quinlan then Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly threatened to resign from the government and join the opposition. The meeting proposed that Quinlan should meet with Moore and obtain a definitive answer as to whether he would include the line on the schedule of proposed railways. Part of the 1917 Western Australian Royal Commission into Agriculture map ‚Äì showing the Clackline to Newcastle (Toodyay) then to Piawaning railway line (Bolgart is shown in smaller lettering above Bejoording) ‚Äì to the left on the map the Midland Railway line, to the right the Northam to Goomalling to Mullewa railway line. History The matter of a line between Newcastle and Bolgart was first raised in 1897. A number of state governments promised the construction of the line starting with the James Government, the line again promised by the Rason Government. The Labor Government then surveyed the line; this was followed with the Moore Government letting contracts for construction. At the sod turning ceremony Quinlan noted that the line from Clackline had not been a financial success but that opening this section would improve its fortunes. On 20 October 1908 the tender for the construction of the line was awarded to Barry & McLaughlin as the lowest bidder at ¬£25,744 2s. 4d. With the addition of costs for rail and fastenings the total cost was ¬£48,000, which was ¬£2,000 above the original estimates at the time of presenting legislation to parliament for construction; a significant portion of the tender was costs associated with bridge construction. Construction officially commenced on 4 December 1908 when the Governor of Western Australia Frederick Bedford turned the first sod of soil during a ceremony near Newcastle. The Governor noted that this was the first time he had officiated at the construction of a railway. During his visit the Governor stated that was he glad he would not leave Western Australia without being associated in some way with the policy of agricultural railways construction for the state. As a memento of the occasion the Governor was presented with a miniature shovel that had a sandalwood handle and gold blade. The line was opened on 6 December 1909; on 10 December 1909 a bush fire was started by sparks from a train on the line causing considerable damage despite the efforts of some 300 volunteers fighting the fire. Another fire broke out on 11 December 1909, destroying 250 acres of wheat crop owned by Quinlan. Toodyay Vigilance Committee Following on from the public meeting on 6 November a further meeting was held on 8 November 1906 at the Newcastle Mechanics Institute; this meeting was chaired by Mr O. Bull. The Mayor of Newcastle Father Hallinan moved that the Toodyay Vigilance Committee be formed to watch carefully all matters related to the Newcastle‚ÄìBolgart Railway and to keep their claims before the public and the WA Parliament. The meeting was surprised to learn that the premier hadn't responded to the request from the prior meeting for the him to meet with Quinlan. The meeting was also informed that the Norseman railway was on the schedule, which caused consternation given that the Norseman rail had repeatedly been refused by previous WA Governments and that the Bolgart line had been repeatedly promised. Another deputation on behalf of the Vigilance Committee was received by the Premier to discuss the railway construction. They advised the premier that the Midland Railway Company and other prominent large land holders had subdivided their land to put it on the market. Mr Camerer explained to the premier that as a dairy farmer from Victoria he took up land in Bolgart after being assured two years prior that the railway was being built he could not continue without the line. It was also noted that 15,000 acres were under crop within five miles of the proposed route of the railway. The premier replied that there was justification for the line and that he had already decided to bring a bill for construction of the Newcastle‚ÄìBolgart Railway. Timber contract issues The builders of bridges on the line, Barry & McLaughlin, had engaged Joseph Shearer, a timber cutter and teamster, to supply timber. On 31 March 1910 Shearer took action in the Supreme Court alleging that Barry & McLaughlin breached their contract by purchasing timber directly from his employees.

McMurrin (born 1939) is an American conductor and pastor.  Early life  McMurrin was born in Xenia, Ohio. He earned a degree in music from Olivet Nazarene University and became a teacher at Xenia High School. He then earned a masters degree from Ohio State University. He later became a music instructor in a college where he also studied conducting techniques.  Musical career = United States  McMurrin started working in music in 1972 at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He later became the director of music at the church. After 16 years at Coral Ridge, McMurrin left to become director of music at Highland Park Presbyterian Church in Dallas, Texas and then moved on to First Presbyterian Church in Orlando, Florida. McMurrin has also performed on Diane Bish's The Joy of Music, including as part of the Coral Ridge choir during an episode about the life of John Wesley. Ukraine In 1991, McMurrin was invited to Kiev, Ukraine by Episcopal priest, George McCammon to conduct local musicians in a performance of Georg Friedrich H√§ndel's Messiah. McMurrin had initially planned to go to the Caribbean and was only aware of Kiev from The Great Gate of Kiev from Pictures at an Exhibition. Upon arrival in 1992, McMurrin became aware that the Ukrainians had not heard Messiah before as it had been banned by the Soviet Union. McMurrin conducted the musicians in performing two concerts in Ukraine, where Messiah was performed for the first time in 70 years in Ukraine. During the plane ride back to the United States, McMurrin felt that God wanted him to move to Ukraine. McMurrin moved to Ukraine permanently in 1993 where he taught English and musical theory at St. Andrew's Preparatory School. In December McMurrin had to return to the United States as he only had $16 left. Friends gave McMurrin money for him to return to Ukraine and set up the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the first private orchestra in Ukraine. The orchestra later went on tours of Ukraine and the United States. In 1994, McMurrin established the Church of the Holy Trinity as a place for the orchestra to play, becoming an ordained pastor in the process. At the time, most of the orchestra members were atheists or agnostics; however, a group of them became Christians after performing Christian music with McMurrin. McMurrin became the pastor of the church, which was assisted in funding as a result of the Orange Revolution.  Personal life  McMurrin is the son of the Reverend Albert McMurrin.

Johann Poppe's Neo-Renaissance facades and carefully finished interiors can still be seen today. Background Original building,1908 Since 1788, when it first arrived in Bremen on emigrant ships returning from North America, cotton has been an important commodity for the city. In 1894, over a million bales of cotton were unloaded, reaching a maximum of 2.6 million bales in 1927. In 1872, the Committee for the Cotton Trade (Komit√© f√ºr den Baumwollhandel) was created to promote the interests of those involved in the cotton market. Banks, shipping companies, cotton mills and insurance companies later became members too. In 1900, work began on the construction of the Cotton Exchange Building in the centre of Bremen. The exchange allowed the trading of Futures in 1914. but the First World War and the ensuing inflation prevented their re-establishment until 1926. The exchange closed again for the Second World War. During the war, the rear part of the building was destroyed in RAF bombing attacks on Bremen, and the steeple-like tower in front was severely damaged and later pulled down. After repairs, the exchange reopened in 1956. In 1961, a multistory parking garage was built where the rear part of the building had been. Even today, the \\"Rules of the Bremen Cotton Exchange\\" serve as a useful reference in drawing up contracts and solving disputes in the international cotton market. The Bremer Baumwollb√∂rse still has over 200 members (2014) but its offices are now in Wachtstra√üe.International Cotton Advisory Group , icac.org, retrieved 11 February 2014 Architecture Johann Poppe (1837‚Äì1915), who had gained a reputation for his skill in designing some of Bremen's large public buildings including the waterworks (1873) and the library (1896), was selected as the architect for the Cotton Exchange. Located on the corner of Wachtstra√üe and the Marktplatz, the building which originally had five storeys was completed in 1902. It combined the latest structural techniques (becoming Bremen's first steel-framed building) with a high degree of functionality and an imposing Neo-Renaissance facade. The architecture critic Walter M√ºller-Wulckow described the Bremen Cotton Exchange, which started to shed its profuse ornamentation after exposure to the elements, as the \\"crassest\\" manifestation of \\"cancerous\\" building styles.Die Bremer Baumwollb√∂rse ist das krasseste Beispiel dieser Art, von deren Formenf√ºlle schon kurz nach der Vollendung abbl√§tternde Ornamente Passanten erschlagend herabst√ºrzten und auf diese geradezu groteske Weise die Krebssch√§den unserer Baupraxis gezeigt haben. - \\"The crassest example of this kind is the Bremen Cotton Exchange, decorations from it having peeled off beginning soon after completion, to fall and strike passersby and in this utterly grotesque manner demonstrate the cancerous lesions of our mode of building.\\" Cited in Heinz Stoffregen, 1879-1929: Architektur zwischen Tradition und Avantgarde, ed. Nils Aschenbeck, Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1990, , p. 11. As a result of weathering, the richly decorated outer walls of sandstone had to be almost completely renewed from 1922 to 1924 under the supervision of Otto Blendermann. Its carefully designed interiors can still be seen today. Of particular note are the stairway with railings by Hermann Prell and the glass mosaics in the main entrance by Puhl & Wagner.

Heinz Drosihn was an SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer and the commandant of Ereda concentration camp in Estonia. Their paths intersect in the camp, where they fell in love, were forced to flee, and subsequently were shot or committed suicide during their flight to Scandinavia. Their story was preserved mainly thanks to fellow inmates of Inge Sylten. The Czech filmmaker and researcher Luk√°≈° P≈ôibyl called their story \\"... Romeo and Juliet story in a concentration camp\\".  Background  After the arrival to Estonia, Inge Sylten was sent to slave work in the J√§gala concentration camp, a facility with less harsh conditions than in other camps.Maripuu (2013), p. 39 In mid-October 1943, the surviving Czech and German Jewish women were sent to Ereda concentration camp, a division of the Vaivara concentration camp in northeastern Estonia. Their position in the camp was somewhat privileged, as they apparently came from the upper classes of society and usually spoke good German.Maripuu (2013), p. 40 Heinz Drosihn noticed Inge immediately after her arrival to the camp. He was considered a \\"normal cruel SS man\\", however, he visited her in the camp's emergency room on the same day and asked if she was cold. She initially refused better blankets and more food, but few days later she moved to his house and became his personal cook. Her influence in the camp gradually increased. During one occasion, she forbade the commandant to use his whip with whom he had punished the inmates. She also sent a carriage for a group of inmates stranded in a snowstorm. However, their relationship was not one-sided and Drosihn was not exploited by a clever inmate. Gisela Danziger, Drosihn's former personal cook, recalled that after few weeks of their relationship he pulled off the military insignia from his uniform, claiming that he doesn't want to serve the SS anymore.Maripuu (2013), p. 41 \\"It was like they forgot where they are completely,\\" Danziger said. This lasted for three months until the command of the Vaivara concentration camp intervened. During a control in February 1944, they found Inge Sylten living in unusually good conditions. She was beaten and interrogated. Drosihn came back to the camp shortly after that, but immediately disappeared. Three days later, Inge Sylten disappeared too, with the help of Danziger, who dug a tunnel under the barbed wire fence drawn around the camp. The pair planned to flee to Finland through the Gulf of Finland; however, they were soon captured. They were shot or committed suicide. They were buried in an unknown place.Maripuu (2013), p. 42  Legacy  The story was covered by the documentary Forgotten Transports: To Estonia.

Several states have claimed interests over the sea bed adjoining Rockall. Denmark (for the Faroe Islands), Iceland, Ireland and the United Kingdom have all made submissions to the commission set up under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  Overview  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states, \\"Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\\" The convention was ratified by all four states in dispute over the Rockall Plateau ‚Äì Iceland on 26 January 1985, Ireland on 21 January 1996, the United Kingdom on 25 July 1997 and Denmark on 16 November 2004. The twenty-fourth session of the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) was held in New York from 10 August to 11 September 2009. Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom have made submissions. Denmark was due to make a submission before the end of 2014. On 7 November 1988 the United Kingdom and Ireland agreed a delineation which ignores Rockall's existence and have granted exploration rights. This bilateral agreement is disputed by Iceland and by Denmark. In 1997, the UK Government declared that \\"The United Kingdom's fishery limits will need to be redefined based on St Kilda, since Rockall is not a valid base point for such limits under Article 121(3) of the Convention.\\" This is the only example to date of a state voluntarily downgrading an insular feature to \\"a rock\\" and thus reducing the area of its claimed maritime zones.Maritime Boundary Disputes, Settlement Processes, and the Law of the Sea By Seoung-Yong Hong, Jon M. Van Dyke, Martinus Nijhoff 2009 (p. 29)  Individual claims = Denmark / Faroe Islands  The Faroe Islands are an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Since 1948 they have had self-government in almost all matters except defence and foreign affairs. Consequently, their interests in Rockall are represented by Denmark. On their behalf, Denmark claims continental shelf rights in the Hatton-Rockall area. A communiqu√© issued by the Prime Minister's Office on 7 May 1985 announced the designation of not only the seabed in the immediate vicinity of the Faroes but also a vast area of the Rockall plateau to the south west. The press release which accompanied the communiqu√© indicated that the legal basis of this designation was the assumption that \\"the Faroe Islands are part of the microcontinent\\" formed by the \\"Faroes-Rockall Plateau\\", an \\"elevated plain with its summit in the Faroe Islands\\".  Iceland  Iceland does not claim the rock itself, considering it irrelevant as far as delimitation of EEZs and continental shelf is concerned. Iceland however claims an extended continental shelf in the Hatton-Rockall area. Despite its long history of human habitation into the 20th century, Iceland considers St. Kilda to be \\"a minuscule, effectively uninhabited, islet, categorized under article 121(3) of the Law of the Sea Convention\\". Furthermore, St. Kilda lies outside the British territorial sea limit. Therefore, it is not an \\"equitable basepoint for an equidistant line\\". Iceland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1985; it was the first Western country to do so. A regulation was issued by the government in that same year outlining the area where Iceland claimed continental shelf rights for itself; the regulation was based on legislation from 1979 claiming for Iceland the exclusive right to research and exploitation of continental shelf-based resources within the limits of the Icelandic continental shelf. Regarding the Hatton-Rockall area, it claims the area within from the foot of the continental shelf and assumes that the UK and Ireland cannot claim a continental shelf outside their EEZs. To its fullest extent, this area reaches about to the south from Iceland's coast, which is further south than the United Kingdom's southernmost point. In 2001, Iceland began working on its submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf; it was scheduled to finish in 2007. The most important aspect of this work is to survey the entire ocean floor in the areas claimed outside the EEZ and, in Iceland's case, a part of the area inside the EEZ as well. In all, 1.3 million square kilometres (500,000 sq mi) have been surveyed by Icelandic marine research institutions for this purpose, an area 13 times larger than the land area of Iceland. The commission does however not make proposals regarding areas that are claimed by two or more states unless they have already reached an agreement on its division. Therefore, Iceland's submission is expected to deal only with the area that just Iceland has claimed and not the Hatton-Rockall area. Iceland also hosted an informal meeting of all parties to the dispute in 2001. It was the first such meeting regarding the dispute where all four countries participated.  Ireland  Irish Naval Service vessel, L√â R√≥is√≠n, on routine patrol at Rockall, 230 nautical miles off the north-west coast of Ireland, 12 October 2012 According to a Written Parliamentary Answer from the Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs on 14 June 1990, an agreement was reached between the British and Irish governments on delimitation of the continental shelf between the two countries and that this included a line of delimitation across the Rockall Plateau. As a result, a very extensive area under Irish jurisdiction, including part of the Rockall Trough and Plateau, is not disputed by the United Kingdom. No further negotiations were taking place in relation to the rock at the time. More recently, on 11 June 2003, the Irish Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources gave a Written Parliamentary Answer, stating: \\"Ireland claims an extended continental shelf ... up to more than 500 nautical miles (926 km), particularly in the Hatton‚ÄìRockall area\\". As the United Nations has no mandate regarding issues of delimitation between neighbouring states and cannot consider an area under dispute without the agreement of all the parties concerned, Ireland has participated in informal discussions with Iceland and the Faroe Islands in an attempt to resolve the dispute before making its submission to the Commission.  United Kingdom  Rockall is within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claimed by the United Kingdom. In 1997, the UK ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and thus relinquished any claim to an extension of its EEZ beyond the islet. The remaining issue is the status of the continental shelf rights of the surrounding ocean floor. These are the exclusive rights to exploit any resources on or under the ocean floor (oil, natural gas, etc.) and should not be confused with the EEZ, as continental shelf rights do not carry any privileges with regard to fisheries. Ownership of these rights in the Rockall area are disputed between the United Kingdom, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands), Ireland and Iceland.  Conferences = Reykjav√≠k conference  Representatives from the UK, Ireland, Iceland, and Denmark, met in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland in September 2007 for negotiations over territorial rights over the continental shelf in the area. The final boundary will be determined by the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The parties had until May 2009 to submit reports to the commission, which it will take into account when determining the boundary. The involved states had the option of submitting separate reports, or a joint one. Sovereignty over the rock itself did not form part of the negotiations.  Copenhagen conference  In November 2007, talks were held in Copenhagen. Here a template for a deal was secured by Irish, Danish, British and Icelandic diplomats.  Dublin conference  As a follow-up to Copenhagen, the Government of Ireland was to host negotiations. They were due to commence in January 2008, but were postponed because of elections in the Faroe Islands. The talks are hoped to bring the four nations closer to reaching an agreement over the Rockall-Hatton basin. It is understood a final deal is not likely to be agreed at the Dublin meeting. The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Dermot Ahern said The latest conference between all four parties occurred in Reykjavik in May 2011  References  Notes Category:Rockall ","title":"Rockall Bank dispute"},{"id":"41881953","text":"Praproƒçe may refer to several places in Slovenia: *Praproƒçe, Dobrova‚ÄìPolhov Gradec, a settlement in the Municipality of Dobrova‚ÄìPolhov Gradec *Praproƒçe, Koper, a settlement in the Municipality of Koper *Praproƒçe, Ribnica, a settlement in the Municipality of Ribnica *Praproƒçe, Semiƒç, a settlement in the Municipality of Semiƒç *Praproƒçe pri Grosupljem, a settlement in the Municipality of Grosuplje *Praproƒçe pri Temenici, a settlement in the Municipality of Ivanƒçna Gorica *Praproƒçe v Tuhinju, a settlement in the Municipality of Kamnik *Prapro≈°e, a settlement in the Municipality of Radovljica, sometimes known as Praproƒçe ","title":"Praproƒçe"},{"id":"41881956","text":"Ajay Dharam Singh is an Indian politician who is the current MLA from Jewargi and son of Dharam Singh former Chief Minister of Karnataka.

Both vehicles of the train were derailed, killing two people and injuring 20 others. Accident At 11:10 local time (10:10 UTC) on 8 February 2014, the 09:25 passenger train travelling from Nice to Digne-les-Bains operated by the Chemins de Fer de Provence was derailed when it was struck by a rock which had fallen down a mountain and hit the train as it was passing. Two people were killed and 20 were injured. Both victims were travelling in the part of the train that was struck by the rock. The train was carrying 34 passengers in addition to the driver. The train involved was an AMP800 diesel multiple unit. The accident occurred in a remote location between Annot and Saint-Beno√Æt, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Two helicopters were sent to the scene, as well as 110 firefighters in 32 vehicles. Those not requiring medical attention were evacuated to Annot. Of the two victims, one was a 49-year-old Russian national and the other an 82-year-old French national, both female. Four people remained in hospital at least overnight. Investigation An investigation into the accident was begun by the French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA-TT) and the Institut de recherche criminelle de la gendarmerie nationale (IRCGN) on 9 February. The scene was scanned with lasers and a 3D computer generated recreation of the accident was made to assist with the investigation. The line was to remain closed whilst the investigation continued, with no firm date set for reopening. It was reported that the weather in the preceding days had been alternating between rain and snow, with the freeze-thaw effect possibly contributing to the cause of the rockfall. The two train event recorders were retrieved from the wreckage of the train on 18 February. Aftermath , the railway was still closed; Route nationale 202 (RN 202), which was below the railway, was also closed, as it had been since the derailment. This resulted in numerous and diverse transport problems in the small towns in the area. A mayors' meeting scheduled for 26 February at Dignes was to call for a quick RN 202 reopening.

Hakan Kƒ±ran (born 1962) is a Turkish architect, noted for his buildings in Istanbul. He is probably best known for designing the Golden Horn Metro Bridge with Michel Virlogeux, in which he was responsible for the architectural design and the construction supervision. He founded Hakan Kiran Architecture and Building Services in 1989. Early years Born 1962 in Ankara, Hakan Kƒ±ran grew up in a mining town, which was constructed by the French. The extraordinary concept of his hometown impressed him. Much liked the town's planning, he steered for studying architecture. In 1980, he entered State Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul (, ƒ∞DGSA), today Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University to study architecture. After graduation in 1989, Kƒ±ran made a Master's degree ln art restoration at his alma mater. During his education and some time after, he worked in an architecture office and gained experience. Career Hakan Kƒ±ran established his own office in 1989, and worked until 1998 on conservation projects of very important historical buildings. His first main architectural design project was \\"Mydonose Showland\\" in 1998, an entertainment center in the form of a giant pyramid tent across Atat√ºrk International Airport in Bakƒ±rk√∂y district. However the complex, renamed later to Istanbul Show Center (), was demolished in 2009 after a fire destroyed it in April that year. In 2004, he designed the Golden Horn Metro Bridge, which was commissioned by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. The cable-stayed bridge has a swing bridge at one end and features a metro station in the middle. Its realization took almost ten years as a result of revisions needed to comply with UNESCO regulations requiring it not to disturb the old city's skyline. He designed and built a project named \\"Larus Palas\\" worth US$30 million in the G√∂kt√ºrk neighborhood of Istanbul's Ey√ºp district, which was completed in 2013 and consists of 82 domiciles, 18 stores as well as facilities for sports, recreation and social activities.

To support each of the five new battle groups in the division, the division artillery had a separate batteries of five 105mm howitzers that reported directly to the division artillery without intermediate battalions. The division artillery's five 105mm howitzer batteries were designated as Batteries A, B and C of the 319th Artillery and Batteries D and E of the 320th Artillery. When Battery C, 319th Artillery accompanied the 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 503rd Infantry to Okinawa in 1960, Battery C, 320th Artillery was activated to replace it in the Division Artillery. To provide general support and nuclear fires, Battery B, 377th Artillery manned four Honest John (later Little John) rocket launchers. The pentomic Division Artillery, with only 25 105mm howitzers, was a significant reduction in combat power. Partly due to this lack of firepower, the pentomic organization lasted only until 1964. http://cdm16635.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getfile/collection/p16635coll14/id/50652/filename/50374.pdfpage Directory and Station List of the United States Army, 15 August 1960 The 82nd Airborne Division Artillery implemented the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) on 25 May 1964. Under this organization, the DVIARTY consisted of the HHB, a Little John rocket battery (B/377 FA), and three 105mm direct support battalions: 1st Battalion (Airborne), 319th Field Artillery; 1st Battalion (Airborne), 320th Field Artillery; and the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 321st Field Artillery. Beginning on 30 April 1965, the Division Artillery deployed to the Dominican Republic with the 82d Airborne Division in 1965, but strict rules of engagement limited the employment of artillery. Except for 1 battery from 1-320 FA, the DIVARTY was redeployed by the end of May. The remaining battery redeployed on 28 June 1966.Greenberg, MAJ Lawrence M. United States Army Unilateral And Coalition Operations In The 1965 Dominican Republic Intervention (CMH Pub 93-5). Washington: Center for Military History, 1987: 84. Following the Tet Offensive in February 1968, the Division Artillery dispatched 2-321 with the 3d Brigade to Vietnam- the battalion deployed by battery with the brigade's infantry battalions from 16‚Äì27 February 1968. The 2-321 supported the Golden Brigade's operations in Vietnam for over 18 months, redeploying in October and November 1969. During the deployment of 2-321, the Division Artillery created an additional battalion, 3rd Battalion (Airborne), 320th Field Artillery, to support a provisional 4th Brigade formed by the division. Neither 3-320 nor 4th Brigade ever achieved full strength or operational readiness, and 3-320 inactivated on 15 December 1969. Post Cold War under construction Global War on Terror In September 2003, the Division Artillery returned to Iraq. Operating from Camp Champion Main in Ar Ramadi, the Division Artillery conducted captured enemy ammunition operations, consolidating and destroying nearly 50,000 short tons of ammunition and consolidating 92 unsecured storage areas into 4 secured storage areas. The Division Artillery was also base camp mayor for Camp Champion Main. The Division Artillery returned to Fort Bragg in March 2004. As part of the 82d Airborne Division's response to Hurricane Katrina, the Division Artillery established an interagency operations cell at Louis Armstrong International Airport, bringing together more than 25 organizations.Wombwell, James A.

The raid took place on 30 November 1981 by members of the 1 and 4 Reconnaissance Regiments. Background The Petrangol refinery was built in 1958 and supplied Angola with petrol, diesel, and jet fuel and managed by Belgium company Petrofina SA . The refinery was to be attacked around 1am on 30 November with the intention to damage or destroy the distillation towers, fuel tanks and pipelines within the refinery complex. Members of 1 Reconnaissance Regiment (1RR) would conduct the initial surveillance of the refinery and the actual attack while 4 Reconnaissance Regiment (4RR) would man the special forces Barracuda boats and supply the divers with transport to and from the Angolan capital of Luanda supplied by the South African Navy strike-craft. The mission was to be covert and blame laid on UNITA as being responsible and not the South African Defence Force. On 16 November, 1 RR was given training by 4 RR to refresh their knowledge with the boats and by 18 November with the two South African Navy strike-craft. By 20 November the two strike-craft, SAS Oswald Pirow and SAS Jim Fouche, left Saldanha Bay with the 4RR boat crews and a two-man 1RR reconnaissance team and arrived for refuelling on 22 November at Walvis Bay before heading northwards to Angola. The survey vessel would arrive on 24 November at Walvis Bay from Simon's Town and picked up the members of 1 RR attack teams before heading northwards as well. South African units involved * elements - 1 Reconnaissance Regiment * elements - 4 Reconnaissance Regiment * elements - 7 Medical Battalion * SAS Oswald Pirow * SAS Jim Fouche * SAS Protea * SAAF ‚Äì one Wasp helicopter and a C-130 for radio communication for SAR mission Operation On the night of 25 November, the two strike-craft positioned themselves off Luanda, 9 km north-west of the lighthouse at Ponto das Lagostas. Two special forces boats were launched and headed for a point off the shore. Two 4RR divers then entered the water and swam to the beach to ensure the landing point's suitability and its security and then called the boats in to drop off the two-man reconnaissance team. The boats returned to the strike-craft which withdrew 80 km offshore. As the dawn approached, the reconnaissance team found themselves in the middle of military transport storage area, but were able to leave and find a safer hideout during daylight hours. That evening they returned to reconnoitre the transport storage area before proceeding to the refinery, surveilling and photographing the target before returning to their hideout having establishing an inward and exit route for an attack teams. After spending another day at the hideout, on the evening of 27 November, the strike-craft returned and the boats collected the reconnaissance team. The two strike-craft then set off for their rendezvous with the SAS Protea on the early morning of 28 November for refuelling as well as the final planning and briefings of the forthcoming raid and the transfer of the attack teams. By early evening of 29 November, the two strike-craft were 16 km off Luanda. Four boats were launched for the beach landing site and again dropped off the two reconnaissance team divers to investigate the landing site. The four boats were then signalled to land. A communications team was left on the cliffs to maintain radio contact between the teams and the strike-craft. The HQ and attack teams then proceeded to the outer perimeter fence of the refinery. None of the guard towers appeared to be occupied nor was the inner fence maintained. By 23h57 the four attack teams had cut their way inside the refinery grounds while the support and HQ teams maintaining the security of the exit route. Team 5 guarded the cut fence. Team 1 proceeded to their target, three distilling towers, but were unable to lay their explosive in the right position as the design of the first tower and a manned control station did not match the intelligence so the explosives were laid on pipes into the tower. Signalling the rest of the teams to begin their arming they proceeded to the second tower that appeared unmanned and out of commission. While attempting to break into the tower they were interrupted by a premature explosion from within the refinery at Team 4's site. They then armed and left the charges at the towers' base and returned to the entrance site. Team 2's targets were twelve jet fuel tanks. They were able to place six charges before the premature explosion from within the refinery interrupted them. Following orders if the plan changed, they left the remaining charges against a tank and before attempting to arm one of the charges, a second premature explosion occurred within the refinery and so they left the explosives unarmed and returned to the entry point on the fence. Meeting Team 1 they joined in the search of Team 4. Team 3 managed to lay their charges on two spherical gas tanks and had proceeded to two horizontal tanks when the first premature explosion occurred within the refinery. Orders were now to return to entry point, but finding their route blocked by guards proceeded to another part of the perimeter fence and exited leaving their remaining two charges on pipelines leading to the harbour before returning to the rendezvous point by following the fence. Team 4 had charges to place on twelve crude oil tanks and they began to place them as soon as Team 1 gave the order to start. About seven minutes after they started, one of their charges prematurely exploded and they decided to place the remaining charges together and Captain de Kok armed one but it exploded and the other two team members of the team were injured. One badly team member made it back to the entry point and so Team 1 and 2 re-entered the refinery to find the two missing men and found another team member badly burnt and blinded and returned him to the entry point and resumed their search for the De Kok, but after a third premature explosion it became too dangerous and it was realised he could not have survived. The men returned to the entry point in the fence and made contact with the HQ team, returning to the beach via the vehicle transport area to save time while more premature explosions occurred in the refinery. The boats were already on the beach waiting and the strike-craft were closer to the shore to speed up the pick-up. The two injured were transferred to individual strike-craft for treatment by medical teams and as soon as the boats were loaded, headed out to sea as several more explosions broke out in the refinery. The two strike-craft would later rendezvous with SAS Protea and transferred the two injured men and latter would then head for Walvis Bay reaching there on 2 December where the men were transported to Pretoria for medical treatment. The two strike-craft left Angolan waters and would arrive back in Langebaan with the 1 & 4 Reconnaissance Regiment teams on 4 December before sailing for Simon's Town later that day to refuel and restock and return to their bases. Aftermath Fire-fighters managed to bring the fires under control by 1 December while all fires had been extinguished by 3 December. Angolan and Western oil officials claimed that if the attack had been successful, the city of Luanda would have taken damage from the explosion and the release of poison chemicals. Brave refinery workers had managed to remove lead tetrachloride, which the South Africans did not know about, from the tanks before the flames got to them. Kundi Paiama, Angola's Minister of State Security was demoted after the raid because of the security lapses. Several infantry units were called in to guard the complex while security infrastructure within the refinery was upgraded. The Belgium operator of the refinery reckoned the damage to the refinery would be repaired in two months. It was close to three months before partial production began again. Seventeen tanks had been destroyed, but the gas spheres had not exploded even though their contents burnt close the point of the explosion. The South African intelligence reckoned that $60 million of various fuel products had been lost and that the damage was worth $36.5 million. Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, initially claimed responsibility for the attack by a small assault team firing RPGs. But his version of events did not match the evidence left behind by the attackers. By the 1 December, Angolan officials presented evidence to Western diplomats that the attack had been carried out by South African \\"mercenaries\\". It appeared that SADF special forces member, Captain AJP de Kock, was killed instantly when demolition explosives he was laying, prematurely exploded. His remains, the mines, weapons and other sabotage equipment that was left behind were presented to the world's media. The raid was acknowledged as a South African special forces operation during the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

He was well known in his day for his paintings of religious, historical or mythical subjects, but has now been largely forgotten. Artists who trained in his studio and went on to achieve fame include Edgar Degas, Gustave Achille Guillaumet and Henri Pille. Early years thumb F√©lix-Joseph Barrias was born on 13 September 1822 in Paris. His brother was Louis-Ernest Barrias (1841-1905), who became a well-known sculptor. His father was a painter on porcelain, and taught F√©lix-Joseph Barrias, who proved to be an adept pupil and was able to earn his own living by the age of 16. F√©lix-Joseph Barrias then studied under L√©on Cogniet. He won the Prix de Rome in 1844 with his picture of Cincinnatus Receiving the Deputies of the Senate. This let him travel to Italy for further studies. In 1847 he exhibited at the Salon for the first time with his Young Girl Carrying Flowers and Roman Spinner. Barrias received a third class medal in 1847 and a second class medal in 1851 for his The Exiles of Tiberius (Louvre).Grunchec 1985, p. 147. At the Exposition Universelle (1855) he received a second class medal for his painting Jubilee Year of 1300 in Rome. Career Barrias made many paintings on religious, historical or mythical subjects. He also made frescoes for the Church of Saint-Eustache, Paris, Grand H√¥tel du Louvre and Chapel of Saint Genevieve in the church of Sainte-Trinit√©, Paris. He was commissioned in the 1860s to contribute an illustration to an album of works on prayer compiled by William Thompson Walters, as were other noted painters of the day such as William- Adolphe Bouguereau, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and James Tissot. A large painting by Barrias was exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, depicting the French army landing in the Crimea. In 1868 Barrias painted The Legend of the Golden Fleece on the ceiling of Drapers' Hall, London. Barrias created mural works for the Paris Opera of Charles Garnier, and in the 1880s painted a decoration for the Mercers' Hall in London. Barrias exhibited portraits at the Salons of 1879, 1880 and 1881. He made lithograph illustrations for Didot's editions of Virgil and Horace. Barrias taught Edgar Degas (1834-1917) in 1853. Other pupils included Gustave Achille Guillaumet (1840-1884), Fernand Pelez (1848-1913), √âtienne-Prosper Berne-Bellecour (1838-1910), Jehan Georges Vibert (1840-1902), Henri Pille (1844-1897), Henri Michel-L√©vy (1844-1914) and Jean-Jacques Scherrer (1855-1916). Barrias was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 12 July 1859, and an officer on 3 February 1897. He died on 24 January 1907 at the age of 84. Reception According to a contemporary critic, his art \\"is worthy of an artist who is always distinguished by a severe execution, a happy imagination, and a graceful conception of the whole effect. A painter of style, Felix Barrias has neither the solemnity nor the coldness of those who usually claim this title; very careful of the dignity of his art in these times of easy painting, he has never made a compromise with the taste of the day, and for this reason, in every essay on decorative art his name is written in advance. However, his paintings have not stood the test of time, and he is now largely forgotten.

A total of 230 units were built worldwide from 1948 to 1953.  History  Gustavsburg, Robert-Koch-Strasse 23 The MAN factory in Ginsheim-Gustavsburg, looking for new non-military markets after World War II built from 1948 prefabricated steel houses, based on a concept from the 1920s. The concept was developed in the headquarters in Augsburg based on an idea of the engineer Heinz Bauer and was commercially produced in Mainz-Gustavsburg.Enrico Santifaller: Highlights ‚Äì Mittelrhein. (PDF; 2,7 MB) MAN built a sample estate, which once housed the senior staff, close to the Cramer-Klett-settlement of Gustavsburg, which had been built in the style of a garden city in the first quarter of the 20th century. Two different models were presented there, to export them on a large scale worldwide. The model home complex showed the basic type with a base of . Production was however discontinued after production of 230 houses in 1953.  Design Detail of the gable Window in Bad Windsheim The wall elements were pre-fabricated at the MAN factory and then bolted to a steel frame construction which was erected on-site on top of a brick foundation and a thermal insulation layer of fiberglass mats was located between the outer steel sheets and hardboard inside, with an insulation value similar to that of a thick brick wall according to historic advertising brochures. The outside of the steel walls were painted with a solvent-based lacquer as a means of corrosion protection. The architectural design resembled conventional stone buildings: The perforated facade with a gable roof and mullioned windows with shutters were \\"quite plain, but cosy and with all objectivity something for the German mind\\" as required in the specification by the architect Hans Schneider on behalf of MAN in 1949.Johannes Kottj√©: Wohnh√§user aus Stahl: Zeitgem√§√üe Architektur f√ºr lichtdurchflutete R√§ume. (PDF; 14,6 MB) Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt M√ºnchen, . Page 12 of the online excerpt. The basic type could be ordered according to the catalogue with different roof pitches. The inner walls could be built individually, since the roof was supported by the outer walls. The version with the steeper roof provided space for a habitable attic.Ulrich von Mengden: In Gustavsburg stehen noch zehn MAN-Stahlh√§user aus dem Jahr 1948. Main-Spitze of 22 December 2011. There were four different floor plans: , , , and . The individual modules of the steel houses were assembled on site. The rectangular outer wall panels were made of thick steel plate with a size of and were placed next to each other. The interior walls were made of hardboard or plywood panels, which were insulated by glass wool mats from the outer steel sheets. The roof structure was formed from standardized trusses in length. The floor was well insulated with glass wool mats and consisted of tongue and groove planks that were mounted on the modular steel frame construction.Nina Schoel: Praxisarbeit 4: Mobile und modulare Bauten. Bathroom in Bad Windsheim The windows were provided with counterweights and retractable fly screens and could be lowered down into the wall opening as in a railway carriage. A factory built steel wall, which included the water and waste water pipes, was installed between the kitchen and bathroom with the particularity that the bathtub of the narrow bathroom protruded through the wall to save space in the cabinet of the sink. Closets were used to build the remaining interior walls.Rudolf Maria Bergmann: Privates Gl√ºck in Serie: Ein Fertighaus der Nachkriegszeit im Fr√§nkischen Freilandmuseum Bad Windsheim. Bayrische Staatszeitung vom 27 April 2012. The quality of the MAN steel houses proved to be excellent in comparison to the competition of that time. Due to the good thermal insulation, the hot-dip galvanized components and the heat treated paints, there were very little corrosion and condensation problems.Matthias Ludwig: Mobile Architektur. Stuttgart, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1998. Page 71.  Cost  A home with simple equipment then cost 18,800 DM, which was relatively expensive compared to other prefabricated houses that have already been offered from 3,500 DM. Including special fittings such as kitchen, bathroom equipment and hot water central heating a MAN steel houses cost 30,000 DM, which today would correspond to about 70,000 Euros.  Remaining buildings  MAN steel house in the Franconian Open Air Museum in Bad Windsheim In Germany, about 40 MAN steel houses remain, whose outer walls need to be occasionally sandblasted because of corrosion and repainted.Achim Bergmann: Wer im Stahlhaus sitzt, hat‚Äôs gem√ºtlich: Zu Besuch bei einer N√ºrnberger Familie ‚Äì Museum hat nun ein MAN- Geb√§ude. 21 September 2011.

He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology at the University of Chile and is the President of the Chilean Academy of Science. Education and career Asenjo studied for his first degree in chemical engineering at the University of Chile, graduating in 1974. He then moved to the University of Leeds, UK to complete an MSc, followed by a PhD at University College London supervised by Peter Dunnill and M. D. Lilly. He moved back to Chile for one year before being appointed Assistant Professor in biochemical engineering at Columbia University, New York where he remained until 1986. In 1987 he moved to the University of Reading to become a Reader in biochemical engineering and the director of the biochemical engineering laboratory. Then in 1995 he returned to Chile and established the Centre for Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology at the University of Chile which he continues to direct. Research Asenjo has made scientific contributions where the fields of mathematics and computer science merge with biology and biotechnology. This has included developing models of enzyme systems for the lysis of microbial cells and for predicting the behaviour of proteins in aqueous two-phase systems. He has been involved in the purification of several proteins including alpha amylase, tissue plasminogen activator, monoclonal antibodies and virus-like particles. Recently his group have begun working in the fields of protein engineering, metabolic engineering and functional genomics. One specific area of research is an attempt to produce detergents which work at low temperatures based on trypsin enzymes originally isolated from Antarctic krill. The Santiago Times reported in 2013 that Asenjo's group was to begin testing a vaccine for alcoholism on mice and hoped to begin pre- clinical trials in humans later that year. In November 2013 the vaccine was in stage 2 clinical trials. The vaccine acts to inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing people to experience a hangover shortly after consuming alcohol. He has called for Chile to invest more in scientific research and development, which would allow the country to add value to its exports, for example by exporting lithium batteries rather than raw lithium. Recognition He was elected as a member of the Chilean Academy of Science in 1999 and was appointed as its Vice President in 2004 and President in 2010. In 2004 he was awarded the Chilean National Prize for Applied Sciences and Technologies, with the jury noting his research was of a high impact and quality, as demonstrated by over 100 publications, several patents and having supervised over 40 doctoral students.

Her father was Prince Ismail Bey Chkhotua, and her mother was Princess Aliye Hanƒ±m Dziap≈ü-lpa, the daughter of Prince Mahmud Dziap≈ü-lpa. She had a sister named Behiye Hanƒ±m. She was the maternal niece of D√ºrr√ºnev Kadƒ±n, first wife of Sultan Abdulaziz. In 1874, Emine had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where her father entrusted her and her sister to the care of her aunt D√ºrr√ºnev Kadƒ±n. her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Nazperver. Abdulaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876, his nephew Murad V became the Sultan. He was transferred to Feriye Palace the next day. Her aunt D√ºrr√ºnev, and other women of Abdulaziz's entourage didn't wanted to leave the Dolmabah√ße Palace. So they were grabbed by hand and were send out to the Feriye Palace. In the process, they were searched from head to toe and everything of value was taken from them. Nazperver followed her aunt to Feriye Palace. On 4 June 1876, Abdulaziz died under mysterious circumstances. Marriage One day, when Mehmed was in his forties, he visited his aunt-in-law D√ºrr√ºnev Kadƒ±n in the Feriye Palace. Here he saw Nazperver, then eighteen years old, and fell in love with her. He asked his aunt-in-law to give him Nazperver in marriage. She acceded to her nephew-in-law's demand, and the marriage took place in 1888 in the Veliahd Palace. Nazperver didn't bore Mehmed any children. On 27 April 1909, after Mehmed's accession to the throne, she was given the title of \\"Fourth Consort\\". Upon the death of D√ºrr√ºaden Kadƒ±n in October 1909, Nazperver was given the title of \\"Third Consort\\".

According to √ún√ºvar, Nazperver did not appeared particularly learned, but she did had a refined and kindly air about her that made a good impression. She also speculated that having no children weighed heavily upon her, despite the fact that the Sultan treated her most kindly and graciously, and so she lived out her life in this rather downhearted fashion. On 30 May 1918, Nazperver met with the Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma in the harem of Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, when the latter visited Istanbul with her husband Emperor Charles I of Austria. During the Empress's visit, she liaised with her in French, which she had been taught by her aunt D√ºrr√ºnev Kadƒ±n.

Early life  As a child, Scotland aspired to become a painter but on his father's advice he studied architecture. After serving an apprenticeship as a mason, he attended the Technical College in Bremen where he graduated in 1903.  Career  In July 1904, he joined his student friend Alfred Runge (1881‚Äì1946) to work as an architect and building contractor in Bremen. He was also active as a draftsman and painter. As a result of the first few small buildings he completed, he attracted the attention of the director of Norddeutscher Lloyd, Heinrich Wiegand, who commissioned him together with Runge to build a residence for him on Bremen's Wagner-Stra√üe. Thereafter he received numerous assignments in Schwachhausen and the Bremen surroundings. In 1907 Wiegard awarded Runge and Scotland a contract to design the interiors of the four-funnel ocean liner SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie which his company launched in 1907. Earlier ships interiors had been designed by Johann Poppe who still designed the main rooms whilst Scotland & Runge did de luxe cabins and other rooms. The ship was to be the regular ocean liner that linked Bremen with New York City. They designed the luxury cabins where the beds would convert to sofas and the washstands would convert into tables. All of the metalwork was gilded and the surfaces were white with wooden surfaces of violet amaranth inlaid with agate, ivory and citron wood.Studio Magazine , Vol 42, 15 October 1907, retrieved 9 February 2014 Runge and Scotland also worked as graphic designers and they designed iconic postersKaffee Hag, invaluable.com, retrieved 9 February 2014 and packaging for the Kaffee HAG company.

He was president of the Canadian Association of Physicists in 1975‚Äì1976. Biography Born on a farm in Saskatchewan, Douglas received his BA and MA degrees from the University of Saskatchewan. Gerhard Herzberg was his MA thesis advisor. During World War II, Douglas interrupted his studies to do military-related research in the Physics Division at the NRC. After the war, he earned his PhD in physics at Pennsylvania State University under David H. Rank. In 1949 Douglas became NRC's head of the Spectroscopy Section of the Physics Division, which was directed by Gerhard Herzberg. From 1969 to 1973 Douglas was the director of the Physics Division of the NRC. He returned to his previous job as head of the Spectroscopy Section in 1973 and remained in that position until his retirement from the NRC in 1980. A. E. Douglas was the first to observe the spectra of B2, Si2, CH+, SiH+, NF, PF, BN, CN+ and many other diatomic or triatomic molecules. He first identified the 4050 group of lines observed in comets as being due to the C3 molecule. Using a method that he developed, Douglas made the first studies of the Zeeman effect in polyatomic molecules. According to Gerhard Herzberg: > One of Douglas' most important contributions was his recognition of the > reason for \\"anomalous lifetimes,\\" that is, the failure of a simple > relationship between absorption coefficient and lifetime to account for > lifetimes in such compounds as NO2, SO2, C6H6. This phenomenon, referred to > in the most recent literature as the Douglas effect, is closely connected > with internal conversion in larger molecules. In astrophysical applications of molecular spectroscopy, Douglas is known for his identification of interstellar CH+ and of cometary C3 and for the reproduction in the laboratory of the Meinel bands of N2+ and other spectra.

Identity Hammurabi III is probably a son of Yarim-Lim III, however there is two confusions regarding his identity. Confusion with Hammurabi II Hammurabi III was thought to be the same king Hammurabi mentioned in Alalakh tablets AlT 21,22 but it is known that Yarim-Lim III was the king of Yamhad during the destruction of Alalakh and the Hittite annals (dating after the destruction of Alalakah) mention king Hammurabi, son of Yarim-Lim III, therefore the Hammurabi in tablets AlT 21,22 can not be the same king as Hammurabi the son of Yarim-Lim III, which led to the distinction between the two monarchs. The Hammurabi mentioned in AlT 21,22 is Hammurabi II, a predecessor to Yarim-Lim III while the Hammurabi mentioned in the Hittite annals is Hammurabi III,son of Yarim-Lim III. The tablets of Alalakh (the main source for the life of Aleppan Kings) ended with Hattusili I's destruction of Alalakh. This led to the information about Aleppo being scarce. Confusion with Hammurabi Son of Ammitakum Hammurabi III is mentioned in the annals of Hattusili I. Another confusion about his identity arose due to the fact that Ammitakum, king of Alalakh's son and heir was also named Hammurabi. Ammitakum appointed his son as his successor in the presence of Yarim-Lim III, the Hittite texts in connection to the Aleppan wars mentions Yarim-Lim III as the king of Aleppo, also they mentions Hammurabi of Aleppo, son of a king whose name is destroyed. Which caused Michael B. Rowton to give two possibilities about the identity of this Hammurabi, the first is that Hammurabi III was the son of Ammitaqum, the second is that Hammurabi III was the son of Yarim-Lim III, Benno Landsberger believes that Hammurabi of Alalakh is identical with Hammurabi III of Yamhad. War with the Hittites Hattusili I conducted a series of destructive campaigns against Aleppo and its vassals during the reign of Yarim-Lim III. He continued his campaigns against Hammurabi, and finally attacked Aleppo the capital but was repelled, wounded and ultimately died of his wounds in ca. 1620 BC. Before his death, Hattusili proclaimed his young grandchild Mursili as his heir. The Hittite attacks stopped temporarily until Mursili reached manhood. The new Hittite king's attack was characterized with personal need for revenge against Hammurabi and Aleppo, he wanted to avenge Hattusili's blood as it is written in a Hittite text. Mursili's onslaught was decisive: he destroyed Aleppo and moved the captives and booty to Hattusa, ending the kingdom of Yamhad as a power in the Near East around ca. 1600 BC. Fate and Succession The Hittite texts mentions that the king of Aleppo was captured and made atonement to Mursili. How Hammurabi made this atonement is unknown, as is his ultimate fate. Aleppo was rebuilt, after the assassination of Mursili, by Sarra-El a prince of Aleppo (probably a son of Yarim-Lim III) who regained the throne. But Yamhad never regained its former status.

Although he was a track and field athlete, he was talked into signing for Iraklis by two teachers of him, themselves fans of the club. After joining the youth ranks of Iraklis in 1963, Aidiniou, made his first team debut in 1965, scoring against Olympiacos in a 2‚Äì1 away defeat of Iraklis. Aidiniou was the star player of Iraklis until 1974, when he signed for Olympiacos for 11,000,000 drachmas. Aidiniou could not compete for the 1974‚Äì75 season as his transfer was considered overdue. For the whole season he only contested in friendly matches and training courses and that humped his adaptation to his new club. In Olympiacos Aidiniou failed to demonstrate the same level of football as he did in Iraklis and he was released from Olympiacos after the 1977‚Äì78 season. Aidiniou appeared in a total of 40 league matches for Olympiacos, scoring 7 goals. Aidiniou returned to Iraklis for the 1978‚Äì79 season appearing in 13 matches and failing to score any goals.

Note the squadron's dragon insignia on the fuselage just aft of the lower wing Attack Squadron 35 (VA-35) was an aviation unit of the United States Navy. The squadron's nickname is unknown. Its insignia, a winged dragon, was revised several times during its lifetime. The squadron was first established as Torpedo and Bombing Squadron 2 (VT-2) on 6 July 1925, and was redesignated as VT-2B on 1 July 1927, VT-3 on 1 July 1937, VA-4A on 15 November 1946, and, finally, VA-35 on 7 August 1948. The squadron was disestablished on 7 November 1949. It was the first squadron to carry the VA-35 designation, the second VA-35 was redesignated from VA-34 on 15 February 1950 and disestablished on 31 January 1995. Operational history *6 July 1925: VT-2 was established on board at Pearl Harbor. Aroostook had been a minelayer that was refitted as an aircraft tender but continued to carry the CM minelayer designation. *August 1926: The squadron was engaged in experimental work relating to the use of signal lights as a means of communicating between aircraft and ships. *1928: With the arrival of the T3M-2 aircraft, the squadron began the transition from water based aircraft to land planes. The squadron continued its aircraft transition from T3M-2s, which were difficult to land on the carrier, to T4M-1s. The primary mission of the T4M-1s was bombing, although they could be used for torpedo work and laying smoke screens. *January‚ÄìFebruary 1929: Fleet Problem IX was the first time the Navy's two large carriers, (with VT-2B embarked) and , participated in a major fleet exercise. *March‚ÄìApril 1930: In March the squadron participated in Fleet Problem X which was conducted in the Caribbean Sea, followed by the Fleet Problem XI in April. *May 1930: VT-2B's aircraft joined with the planes from 9 other squadrons, which included the USS Saratoga, USS Lexington, and Air Groups, for a three-day tour of east coast cities from Norfolk, Virginia to Boston. The flight was commanded by Captain Kenneth Whiting and consisted of 36 torpedo and bombing planes, 57 fighting planes, 24 scouting planes, 3 amphibian utility planes, 3 Ford trimotor transports and 2 staff planes. It was the largest air parade that had ever been assembled on the east coast. *1931‚Äì1934: The squadron participated in Fleet Problems XII through XV. *31 May 1934: A Fleet Review for President Franklin D. Roosevelt was held in New York Harbor. *1935‚Äì1938: The squadron participated in Fleet Problems XVI through XIX. *May 1937: VT-2B participated in the celebration marking the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge. *April‚ÄìMay 1940: The squadron participated in Fleet Problem XXI. This was the last major Fleet Problem conducted before America's involvement in World War II. *May‚ÄìJune 1942: VT-3, consisting primarily of its pilots, flight crews and a limited number of ground crewmen, operated from during the Battle of Midway. The other officers and ground crews remained ashore at NAS Kaneohe Bay. Shortly after noon on the 4th, Lieutenant Commander L. E. Massey led a flight of 12 TBD Devastators into the attack against the Japanese carriers. They were the last of the three torpedo squadrons to engage the enemy. Only two aircraft survived, both flown by enlisted pilots. The two surviving TBDs returned to the task force while Yorktown was under attack from Japanese carrier aircraft. These two TBDs were ditched and their crews picked up by ships in the task force. VT-3's survivors from Yorktown returned to the squadron at NAS Kaneohe Bay. Lieutenant Commander Massey was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his action during the battle. Eleven other squadron TBD pilots also were awarded the Navy Cross, they were Ensign Wesley F. Osmus, Ensign Carl A. Osberg, Lieutenant Patrick H. Hart, Enlisted Pilot Harry L. Corl, Enlisted Pilot Wilhelm G. Esders, Lieutenant (jg) Curtis W. Howard, Ensign Leonard L. Smith, Enlisted Pilot John W. Haas, Ensign David J. Roche, Ensign Oswald A. Powers, and Lieutenant (jg) Richard W. Suesens. *August 1942: Operating from , VT-3 participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. *November 1942‚ÄìJuly 1943: VT-3 operated from Saratoga, flying combat missions against various Japanese held islands in the South Pacific Area and providing air cover for American forces operating in the Eastern Solomons. When the squadron was not operating from Saratoga it was based ashore at various places, including Fiji; Efate and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; Tontouta, New Caledonia, and Guadalcanal, Solomons. *May 1943: The British carrier joined the Saratoga task force and operated with it until the latter part of July. *31 July 1943: VT-3's TBFs were transferred to Tontouta on 30 July and the following day squadron personnel embarked on HMS Victorious for transfer to CONUS to reform. This ended the air group and squadron's association with Saratoga. *25 September 1943: VT-3 and Saratoga Air Group were reformed at NAS Seattle. The Saratoga Air Group was reformed as Carrier Air Group THREE (CVG-3) with VT-3 as one of the three squadrons. *November 1944: VT-3 conducted combat operations from USS Yorktown (CV-10) against targets in the Philippines in support of the Battle of Leyte. *Dec 1944: The squadron flew combat operations from Yorktown against targets on Luzon in preparation for the invasion of the island. While retiring from the combat area Task Force 38, which included Yorktown and CVG-3, sailed through Typhoon Cobra which sank three destroyers and extensively damaged other ships in the task force. *January 1945: Combat operations were conducted against targets in Formosa and the Philippines in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf on Luzon in early January. With Yorktown leading the way, Task Force 38 entered the South China Sea on 10 January. VT-3 struck targets near Saigon and along the Vietnamese coast, Hong Kong and Canton areas, Formosa and Okinawa. *9 January 1945: For actions against enemy targets on Formosa Lieutenant Frank F. Frazier was awarded the Silver Star. *February 1945: VT-3 participated in the first carrier strikes against the Tokyo area, bombing the Tachikawa Engine Factory, 16 miles from the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Following these strikes the squadron concentrated its attention on Chichi Jima and air support for the invasion of Iwo Jima. This operation was the last combat action for the squadron during World War II. In early March VT-3 transferred to for transit to the States. *June‚ÄìOctober 1948: During the squadron's tour of duty in the Mediterranean the Sixth Fleet was placed on alert due to the outbreak of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War following the establishment of the state of Israel. *November 1948: The squadron participated in cold weather operations in the Northern Atlantic.

This model is a \\"two-way\\", meaning users may buy or sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A Bitcoin ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is a kiosk that allows a person to purchase Bitcoin by using cash or debit card. Some Bitcoin ATMs offer bi-directional functionality enabling both the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the sale of Bitcoin for cash. In some cases, Bitcoin ATM providers require users to have an existing account to transact on the machine. There are two main types of Bitcoin machines: unidirectional (one-way) and bidirectional (two-way). Only about 30% of all crypto ATMs worldwide are bidirectional, and less than 23% in the U.S. Both types are connected to the Internet, allowing for cash purchase and/or sale of Bitcoin. Some machines use a paper receipt and others move money to a public key on the blockchain. Bitcoin cash kiosks look like traditional ATMs, but do not connect to a bank account and instead connect the user directly to a Bitcoin wallet or exchange. While some Bitcoin ATMs are traditional ATMs with revamped software, they do not require a bank account or debit card. According to an advisory issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \\"they may also charge high transaction fees ‚Äì media reports describe transaction fees as high as 7% and exchange rates $50 over rates you could get elsewhere\\".

In February, 2014, the Canadian Finance Minister mentioned plans to introduce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations for virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. In June of that year, the Governor General of Canada approved an amendment to Bill C-31 that would treat cryptocurrency businesses as MSBs, and The Canadian Department of Finance circulated a draft of the proposed regulations in June 2018, but the law was not in Regulations or in effect as of January 2019. However, as of July, 2020, businesses dealing in virtual currencies are now considered Money Services Businesses (MSBs) by FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada.https://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/intro-eng In 2018, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) commissioned an investigation on Bitcoin ATMs to find out if tax laws were being followed by users.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cra-bitcoin-atm-research- survey-1.4771983 It was found that in a two-month period, from December, 2017, to February, 2018, the number of Bitcoin ATMs in Canada had increased by 20%.https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue- agency-cra/public-opinion-research-executive-summaries/bitcoin-atm-in- canadian-businesses.html In June 2019, Vancouver, BC‚Äîthe very city where the world's first Bitcoin ATM had been installed six years earlier‚Äîwas considering a ban on the machines due to money-laundering concerns, according to The Star. United States According to Coin ATM Radar, there were more than 2,342 Bitcoin ATMs in the United States as of January, 2018, with some small shop owners earning a reported $300 a month for rental space. By August, 2020, the number of crypto ATMs had more than tripled, to over 9,000. Transactions fees for ATM use are approximately 16 percent, while online transaction fees run about 7.5 percent. Part of the bitcoin ATMs operating in the US is imported from all over the world, for example from Prague. Czech company General Bytes has placed its machines in Las Vegas among other American cities. Compliance Bitcoin ATM operators need to adjust the limits on deposits and withdrawals according to AML/KYC standards applicable in the jurisdiction where their ATMs are placed. In some countries / states this requires a money transmitter license.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first-past-the-post voting system. Vacancy Spencer Charrington had been Conservative MP for the seat of Mile End since the seat's creation at the 1885 general election. He died on 11 December 1904. Electoral history Charrington easily held the seat at the last election, with an increased majority: Charrington Candidates The local Unionist Association selected 43-year-old Liberal Unionist Harry Levy-Lawson as their candidate to defend the seat. He was the son and heir of Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham. Levy-Lawson was looking to make a return to parliament after a break of ten years. He had sat as a Liberal for St Pancras West from 1885-1892 and for Cirencester from 1893 until his defeat in 1895. He had also sat on the London County Council representing St Pancras West from 1889‚Äì1892. With a general election expected to take place in the near future, Charles Clarke, who had been the Liberal candidate last time had been selected to contest the seat of Peckham. The local Liberal Association had to choose a new candidate and selected 38-year-old businessman Bertram Straus as their candidate to challenge for the seat. Straus was well known in the constituency as he was one of the two sitting members who represented Mile End on the London County Council. In fact Strauss had represented Mile End since 1898, winning three elections in the process. Straus also had experience of fighting parliamentary elections having contested Marylebone West at the 1900 general election.‚ÄòSTRAUS, Bertram Stuart‚Äô, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 8 Feb 2014 The Social Democratic Federation wanted to contest the election but could not secure a willing candidate.\\"Election Intelligence.\\" Times [London] 2 Jan. 1905: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 8 Feb. 2014. Campaign Polling Day was fixed for the 12 January 1905, just 32 days after the previous MP died. The Unionist Governments aborted 1904 Aliens Bill featured in the campaign. The Unionist campaign put the Aliens Bill at the centre of their plans.\\"Election Intelligence.\\" Times [London] 13 Jan. 1905: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 8 Feb. 2014. The Liberal candidate, Straus, who had at first followed party policy in opposing it, later sought to distance himself from the position the Liberal party took in opposing the measure. He declared that he was in favour of excluding \\"undesirable\\" aliens.Illustrated London News 21 Jan. 1905: 80. Illustrated London News. Web. 8 Feb. 2014. This was understood to target Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe. There was quite a large Jewish community in Mile End. Given that Straus was himself a Jew, this might have seemed an odd position for him to take. There had in fact been a reduction of over 500 voters in Mile End compared with the figures of 1900. Result The Liberal Unionist Levy-Lawson held the seat for the government: Levy-Lawson Straus revealed that he felt that Liberal party opposition to the Aliens Bill may have robbed him of the chance to pull off a sensational victory.Illustrated London News 21 Jan. 1905: 80. Illustrated London News. Web. 8 Feb. 2014. The Unionist government was able to force through the Aliens Act 1905 later that year. Aftermath When a general election was held in the following year, Straus again faced Levy- Lawson at Mile End and managed to unseat him to become member of parliament.

psychiatric and oncologic disorders. Corcept has focused on the adverse effects of excess cortisol, studying new compounds that may mitigate those effects. Its executive team is headed by CEO, president and director Joseph K. Belanoff, MD, and by chief medical officer Robert S. Fishman, MD. History Backed by Silicon Valley biotech investors, Corcept Therapeutics was founded in May 1998 by psychiatrists Alan Schatzberg and Joseph K. Belanoff. Eight years later, Corcept remained a small firm with 11 full-time employees. Much of its work (e.g., drug manufacturing and testing on patients) was farmed out to others. In June 2008, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, then the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, criticized Corcept cofounder and prominent psychiatrist Alan Schatzberg, chair of the psychiatry department at Stanford University School of Medicine, for not fully informing the university about the value of his shares in Corcept. According to Grassley, Schatzberg had reported stock holdings in Corcept worth \\"over $100,000,\\" when, in fact, the psychiatrist's stake exceeded $6 million. In July, Stanford said that Schatzberg \\"appropriately disclosed any potential financial conflict of interest,\\" but announced he would nevertheless step down temporarily as principal investigator on his National Institute of Mental Health grant to study the effectiveness of the abortion drug mifepristone as an antidepressant. Grassley also asked Stanford to explain its own financial ties with Corcept, saying the university held licensing agreements for mifepristone. The National Institutes of Health later reinstated Schatzberg as principal investigator.  Treatments  Prolonged exposure to cortisol can lead to a wide range of sometimes life-threatening conditions, including Cushing's syndrome, antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, prostate, breast and ovarian cancer. Corcept Therapeutics has developed over 300 proprietary molecules, which it investigates in collaboration with outside researchers to determine if they can mitigate the effects of excess cortisol.  Korlym  In 2012, Corcept launched the prescription medicine Korlym, a cortisol receptor blocker to control hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Korlym was the first FDA-approved oral therapy for the treatment of such patients. Since Korlym was an orphan drug‚Äîi.e., one developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition‚ÄîCorcept received seven years of exclusive marketing rights, as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs, marketing application filing fee waivers, and assistance from the FDA in the drug development process.Corcept Therapeutics Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. In 2013, Corcept reported $19.7 million in federal tax credits. Corcept's marketing exclusivity for Korlym will end on February 17, 2019, at which time competitors could attempt to introduce generic equivalents. As of 2018, Korlym is Corcept's only product and treats about 1,000 patients annually in the U.S. Korlym's active ingredient is mifepristone, also known as RU-486, which is a medication typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about an abortion. Developed in France in 1980, mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000 for abortion in the U.S. Since then, mifepristone has been marketed by Danco Laboratories, a private pharmaceutical distributor, under the brand name Mifeprex, and is Danco's only product. In 2018, Kaiser Health News reported that the difference in price between Danco's Mifeprex and Corcept's Korlym \\"is striking, even though the ingredients are the same: One 200-milligram pill to prompt an abortion costs about $80. In contrast, a 300-milligram pill prescribed for Cushing's runs about $550 before discounts. Patients wanting an abortion take only one pill. People with Cushing's often take up to three pills a day for months or years.\\" While the price of Mifeprex has remained stable, the price for Korlym has increased nearly 150 percent over the past six years, rising to an average yearly cost per patient of $180,000. \\"We have an expensive drug,\\" said Corcept's CEO Joseph K. Belanoff, MD. \\"There's no getting around that.\\" In 2017, Corcept's revenue nearly doubled to $159.2 million, and executives expect to reach $275 million to $300 million in 2018. In January 2018, Corcept's stock price rose 27.4 percent. Executives say revenue from Korlym, which cost about $300 million to develop, has paid for development of new drugs. By December 2016, Corcept had discovered three structurally distinct series of selective cortisol modulators that, unlike mifepristone, do not terminate pregnancy. In March 2018, Corcept reported an encouraging phase II clinical trial update on relacorilant, a possible successor to Korlym that could treat Cushing's syndrome without the side effects of endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding experienced by some women. > Warning. Since each tablet for oral use contains 300 mg of mifepristone, > Korlym should never be taken by women who are pregnant or who might become > pregnant. Taking Korlym during pregnancy will result in the loss of a > pregnancy.  Oncology  In December 2013, the company announced plans to extend its development program for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists into oncology, and licensed patent rights from the University of Chicago's Center for Technology Development & Ventures covering the use of GR antagonists in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer.

It first aired across all of Channel 4's television channels on the day of the official opening of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, 7 February 2014, having been released on YouTube the previous night, on 6 February 2014. Within 48 hours of its online release (by 8pm 8 February 2014), it had accumulated over half a million views. The video opens with a title slide saying: \\"Channel 4 proudly presents A SPECIAL WINTER ANTHEM\\" and depicts a fictional scenario in which a young woman enters a small auditorium and takes a seat as one of the last people to arrive. A man (Fred Bear of cabaret act Bearlesque), wearing a large brown fur coat, appears on stage and starts singing a song parodying the National Anthem of Russia, with his hand held to his chest. Several members of the audience stand and emulate his gesture. Within a few bars, the singer turns around to face a red curtain behind him; this now opens up to reveal a rainbow arch with light bulbs which illuminate, and the music style changes into an up-beat dance track. Four female dancers, wearing cabaret costumes and sunglasses, appear and peel the fur coat off the singer, while putting a set of fake bear ears on his head. Now only wearing his boots, socks, red shorts with a fake bear tail and his bear ears, the man continues singing and dancing, repeating the chorus: \\"Good luck gays on Gay Mountain\\". As the song progresses, more and more members of the audience get up and dance to the music and silver foil confetti rains from the ceiling. Among the cutaways to the audience, a young woman is seen happily dancing on her own, a male couple kiss and a topless DJ wearing sunglasses - who commentators have noted bears some resemblance to Russian President Vladimir Putin \\\\- is also dancing along to the music. Throughout, the lyrics of the song appear as Karaoke-style subtitles. The video ends with the music fading out and a closing slide wishing \\"GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE OUT IN SOCHI.\\" It finally cuts to a station ident that features the Channel 4 logo, a super- imposed, revolving, rainbow-coloured prism and the caption: \\"BORN RISKY\\". Channel 4's Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Dan Brooke, has been quoted as saying: \\"This is a typically Channel 4 way of celebrating the start of the Winter Games and showing our support to all of the athletes out in Sochi, gay or straight.\\" The video was scheduled to be broadcast by the channel for a week after its launch and ties in with Channel 4's temporary rebranding of its logo in the rainbow colours, in response to Russian legislation restricting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, introduced in 2013,LGBT rights in Russia as well as widely reported human rights abuses against members of the LGBT community, such as those investigated in Channel 4's own documentary \\"Hunted\\", which was first broadcast in the \\"Dispatches\\" series on Wednesday 5 February 2014, in the run up to the Sochi Winter Olympics. Gay Mountain drew a largely positive response, with several mainstream media outlets covering its release and viewers' 'likes' outnumbering 'dislikes' on YouTube by 10:1 after two months following its release. The night the Gay Mountain video was first aired on Channel 4, a small portion of the song/routine was performed live, to close an episode of The Last Leg. Earlier in the Last Leg episode, they showed a clip of the original Gay Mountain video, and offered half-hearted protest at Channel 4 blatantly mocking Putin and the anti-LGBT attitudes in Russia, when the makers of The Last Leg (which also airs on Channel 4) had been unofficially cautioned by MI6 in the previous weeks, to cut down on their attempts to poke fun at Putin by portraying him as a gay icon. The live performance of Gay Mountain was intercut with a rap - performed by show hosts Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker - offering their apologies and friendship to Vladimir Putin, and offering hope that he won't have them assassinated with a \\"poisoned umbrella.\\" Channel 4 published the lyrics of Gay Mountain on its own website. They are: Be fabulous, be free We honour our Queens And follow the rainbow which leads to the east Gay mountain, gay mountain Be proud on gay mountain Gay mountain, gay mountain Good luck gays, on gay mountain Mens and all Men's and Womens and all Womens [sic] Come together tonight, sing with pride Gay mountain, gay mountain Be proud on gay mountain Gay mountain, gay mountain Good luck gays, on gay mountain A Gay Mountain Extended Mix was posted to SoundCloud on the same date as the YouTube release.

Early life ≈ûayeste Hanƒ±m was born in 1836 in Sukhumi, Abkhazia. She was a member of the Abkhazian princely family, Inalipa. Her father was Prince Tata≈ü Bey Inalipa, and her mother was Sarey Hanƒ±m. She had three sisters, Princess Fatma Mihrifelek Hanƒ±m, Princess H√ºsnidil Hanƒ±m, and Princess Faruhan Hanƒ±m. She was the maternal aunt of Bedrifelek Kadƒ±n, second wife of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Both of her parents died when she was a child. She had been brought to Istanbul, where her uncle entrusted her and her sister, Fatma Mihrifelek Hanƒ±m, to the imperial harem. Her name was changed according to the custom of the Ottoman court to ≈ûayeste. Marriage ≈ûayeste married Abdulmejid in 1852. She was given the title of \\"Seventh Fortunate\\". A year after the marriage, on 3 February 1853, she gave birth to her first child, a stillborn son. In 1853, she was elevated to the title of \\"Sixth Fortunate\\", in 1854, she was elevated to the title of \\"Fourth Fortunate\\", and in 1856, she was elevated to the title of \\"Third Fortunate\\". On 1 September 1856, she gave birth to her second child, a daughter, Naile Sultan. In 1858-59, she commissioned a mosque in √úsk√ºdar. She was widowed at Abdulmejid's death on 25 June 1861. Widowhood After G√ºl√ºst√º Hanƒ±m's death in 1865, four-year-old ≈ûehzade Mehmed Vahideddin (future Mehmed VI) was entrusted in her care. The prince had a rough time with his overbearing stepmother, and at the age of 16 he left his stepmother's mansion with the three servants who had been serving him since childhood. In 1876, ≈ûayeste married her daughter, Naile Sultan to a relative of hers named √áerke≈ü Mehmed Pa≈üa. Naile died four years later on 7 January 1882 at the age of 25. After Naile's death, Mehmed Pasha married Esma Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdulaziz in 1889. During the reign of Abdul Hamid II, Mehmed was given a mansion in √áengelk√∂y. On this estate, Mehmed had another house built for ≈ûayeste, with whom he had spent his childhood. Even though he had not got along with his stepmother in the past, he could not forget the struggle she had gone through while bringing him up. In March 1898, ≈ûayeste attended the wedding of Naime Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Kemaleddin Pasha, the son of Gazi Osman Pasha. Ay≈üe Sultan, daughter of Abdul Hamid II, notes in her memoirs that during her father's reign, ≈ûayeste would attend Ramadan celebrations, and would always sit next to Perestu Kadƒ±n.

Their importance is underlined by the United Nations declaring 2014 as the International Year of Crystallography, as the 100th anniversary of Max von Laue's 1914 Nobel prize for discovering the diffraction of X-rays by crystals. This chronological list of biophysically notable protein and nucleic acid structures is loosely based on a review in the Biophysical Journal. The list includes all the first dozen distinct structures, those that broke new ground in subject or method, and those that became model systems for work in future biophysical areas of research. Myoglobin Myoglobin sketch Alpha helix 1960 - Myoglobin was the very first high-resolution crystal structure of a protein molecule. Myoglobin cradles an iron-containing heme group that reversibly binds oxygen for use in powering muscle fibers, and those first crystals were of myoglobin from the sperm whale, whose muscles need copious oxygen storage for deep dives. The myoglobin 3-dimensional structure is made up of 8 alpha-helices, and the crystal structure showed that their conformation was right-handed and very closely matched the geometry proposed by Linus Pauling, with 3.6 residues per turn and backbone hydrogen bonds from the peptide NH of one residue to the peptide CO of residue i+4. Myoglobin is a model system for many types of biophysical studies, especially involving the binding process of small ligands such as oxygen and carbon monoxide. Hemoglobin Hemoglobin beta chain Hemoglobin oxy/deoxy transition 1960 - The Hemoglobin crystal structure showed a tetramer of two related chain types and was solved at much lower resolution than the monomeric myoglobin, but it clearly had the same basic 8-helix architecture (now called the \\"globin fold\\"). Further hemoglobin crystal structures at higher resolution [PDB 1MHB, 1DHB) soon showed the coupled change of both local and quaternary conformation between the oxy and deoxy states of hemoglobin, which explains the cooperativity of oxygen binding in the blood and the allosteric effect of factors such as pH and DPG. For decades hemoglobin was the primary teaching example for the concept of allostery, as well as being an intensive focus of research and discussion on allostery. In 1909, hemoglobin crystals from >100 species were used to relate taxonomy to molecular properties. That book was cited by Perutz in the 1938 report of horse hemoglobin crystals that began his long saga to solve the crystal structure. Hemoglobin crystals are pleochroic - dark red in two directions and pale red in the third \\\\- because of the orientation of the hemes, and the bright Soret band of the heme porphyrin groups is used in spectroscopic analysis of hemoglobin ligand binding. HEW lysozyme ribbon Hen-egg-white lysozyme 1965 - Hen-egg-white lysozyme (PDB file 1lyz). was the first crystal structure of an enzyme (it cleaves small carbohydrates into simple sugars), used for early studies of enzyme mechanism. It contained beta sheet (antiparallel) as well as helices, and was also the first macromolecular structure to have its atomic coordinates refined (in real space). The starting material for preparation can be bought at the grocery store, and hen-egg lysozyme crystallizes very readily in many different space groups; it is the favorite test case for new crystallographic experiments and instruments. Recent examples are nanocrystals of lysozyme for free-electron laser data collection and microcrystals for micro electron diffraction. Ribonuclease A ribbon drawing Ribonuclease 1967 - Ribonuclease A (PDB file 2RSA) is an RNA-cleaving enzyme stabilized by 4 disulfide bonds. It was used in Anfinsen's seminal research on protein folding which led to the concept that a protein's 3-dimensional structure was determined by its amino-acid sequence. Ribonuclease S, the cleaved, two-component form studied by Fred Richards, was also enzymatically active, had a nearly identical crystal structure (PDB file 1RNS), and was shown to be catalytically active even in the crystal, helping dispel doubts about the relevance of protein crystal structures to biological function. Two domains of elastase Serine proteases 1967 - The serine proteases are a historically very important group of enzyme structures, because collectively they illuminated catalytic mechanism (in their case, by the Ser-His-Asp \\"catalytic triad\\"), the basis of differing substrate specificities, and the activation mechanism by which a controlled enzymatic cleavage buries the new chain end to properly rearrange the active site. The early crystal structures included chymotrypsin (PDB file 2CHA), chymotrypsinogen (PDB file 1CHG), trypsin (PDB file 1PTN), and elastase (PDB file 1EST). They also were the first protein structures that showed two near- identical domains, presumably related by gene duplication. One reason for their wide use as textbook and classroom examples was the insertion-code numbering system (hated by all computer programmers), which made Ser195 and His57 consistent and memorable despite the protein-specific sequence differences. Papain 1968 - Papain Carboxypeptidase, with Zn CPA inhibitor Carboxypeptidase 1969 - Carboxypeptidase A is a zinc metalloprotease. Its crystal structure (PDB file 1CPA) showed the first parallel beta structure: a large, twisted, central sheet of 8 strands with the active-site Zn located at the C-terminal end of the middle strands and the sheet flanked on both sides with alpha helices. It is an exopeptidase that cleaves peptides or proteins from the carboxy-terminal end rather than internal to the sequence. Later a small protein inhibitor of carboxypeptidase was solved (PDB file 4CPA) that mechanically stops the catalysis by presenting its C-terminal end just sticking out from between a ring of disulfide bonds with tight structure behind it, preventing the enzyme from sucking in the chain past the first residue. Subtilisin ribbon Subtilisin 1969 - Subtilisin (PDB file 1sbt ) was a second type of serine protease with a near-identical active site to the trypsin family of enzymes, but with a completely different overall fold. This gave the first view of convergent evolution at the atomic level. Later, an intensive mutational study on subtilisin documented the effects of all 19 other amino acids at each individual position. Lactate dehydrogenase 1970 - Lactate dehydrogenase Commputer ribbon, with 3 SS Trypsin inhibitor 1970 - Basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, or BPTI (PDB file 2pti), is a small, very stable protein that has been a highly productive model system for study of super-tight binding, disulfide bond (SS) formation, protein folding, molecular stability by amino-acid mutations or hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and fast local dynamics by NMR. Biologically, BPTI binds and inhibits trypsin while stored in the pancreas, allowing activation of protein digestion only after trypsin is released into the stomach. Rubredoxin with nn-heme iron Rubredoxin 1970 - Rubredoxin (PDB file 2rxn) was the first redox structure solved, a minimalist protein with the iron bound by 4 Cys sidechains from 2 loops at the top of Œ≤ hairpins. It diffracted to 1.2√Ö, enabling the first reciprocal-space refinement of a protein (4,5rxn). [NB: beware 4rxn, done without geometry restraints!] Archaeal rubredoxins account for many of the highest-resolution small structures in the PDB. SS-linked insulin monomer Space-grown insulin crystals Insulin 1971 - Insulin (PDB file 1INS) is a hormone central to the metabolism of sugar and fat storage, and important in human diseases such as obesity and diabetes. It is biophysically notable for its Zn binding, its equilibrium between monomer, dimer, and hexamer states, its ability to form crystals in vivo, and its synthesis as a longer \\"pro\\" form which is then cleaved to fold up as the active 2-chain, SS-linked monomer. Insulin was a success of NASA's crystal-growth program on the space shuttle, producing bulk preparations of very uniform tiny crystals for controlled dosage. Staphylococcal nuclease 1971 - Staphylococcal nuclease Cytochrome C 1971 - Cytochrome C T4 phage lysozyme 1974 - T4 phage lysozyme Immunoglobulins 1974 - Immunoglobulins Superoxide dismutase 1975 - Cu,Zn Superoxide dismutase Transfer RNA 1976 - Transfer RNA TIM ribbon drawing, PDB 1tim Triose phosphate isomerase 1976 - Triose phosphate isomerase Pepsin-like aspartic proteases 1976 - Rhizopuspepsin 1976 - Endothiapepsin 1976 - Penicillopepsin Icosahedral viruses 1978 - Icosahedral virus 1981 - Dickerson B-form DNA dodecamer 1981 - Crambin 1985 - Calmodulin 1985 - DNA polymerase Photosynthetic reaction center in membrane 1985 - Photosynthetic reaction center Pairs of bacteriochlorophylls (green) inside the membrane capture energy from sunlight, then traveling by many steps to become available at the heme groups (red) in the cytochrome-C module at the top. This was first crystal structure solved for a membrane protein, a milestone recognized by a Nobel Prize to Hartmut Michel, Hans Deisenhofer, and Robert Huber.

The crystal structures (PDB files 2zuo, 2zv4, 2zv5 and 4hl8) show that each half of the vault is made up of 39 copies of a long 12-domain protein that swirl together to form the enclosure. Disorder at the very top and bottom ends suggests openings for possible access to the interior of the vault.

Background South African intelligence had discovered what they believed was the planning and control headquarters of the ANC for operations planned and executed in the Transvaal, South Africa. The South African team was made up of members from 1 and 6 Reconnaissance Regiments, the latter being made up of old Rhodesian SAS personnel. The operation occurred on 30 January 1981, the target being three houses in the suburb of Matola which lay 16 km from the centre of Maputo. The Mozambican government claims that the twenty SADF special forces members were driven from the border in vehicles that resembled Mozambican army vehicles. One part of the team maintained a roadblock on the main road between Maputo and Matola, while a second team attacked the three ANC buildings. A firefight broke out between the SADF and the ANC inhabitants. The reconnaissance team took two prisoners during the attack. The reconnaissance teams rejoined and returned to the border with South Africa and were said to have been withdrawn by helicopter. Aftermath The SADF lost three reconnaissance soldiers, one of whom could not be found during the withdrawal at the end of the operation and he was left behind. 6 Reconnaissance Regiment was disbanded later during the year and the remaining members integrated into the remaining special forces regiments. The ANC lost 30 personnel, a SADF figure, while the Mozambique government claimed eleven dead and one civilian.

The film premiered on March 1, 2014, on the Lifetime network and starred David Arquette as Jesperson. Gloria Reuben played Melinda Gand, the lead FBI case investigator. Plot Over the course of two years, Keith Jesperson (David Arquette), a long-haul truck driver, kills at least eight women, following his failed marriage and an injury which prevented him from joining the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He meets his first victim in a Portland, Oregon bar and kills her after an argument in his rented home. When Delores Parnicke falsely confesses to committing the murder with her boyfriend, Jesperson sends disturbing letters to the press and even writes confessions on the wall of a highway rest stop and at the body dumps. He signs his notes with a smiley face, earning himself the nickname, \\"Happy Face Killer\\", as he resumes his killing spree. Jesperson is being tracked by FBI Agent Melinda Gand (Gloria Reuben) and Ruskin County Sheriff (Daryl Shuttleworth), with little help from the district attorney after Parnicke confesses to the first murder. It is not until a young mother comes forward to say Jesperson assaulted her, and his new fianc√©e Diane Loftin (Stefanie von Pfetten) disappears, that he can finally be apprehended.

Life Andronikos was the son of the megas doux Alexios Palaiologos and Irene Komnene, and great-great-grandson of the family's founder, George Palaiologos. He was probably born ca. 1190, and had another brother, Michael, who was apparently the elder of the two. Nothing is known of his early life. He was named megas domestikos (commander-in-chief) of the Empire of Nicaea, but sources differ on when and by whom: Nikephoros Gregoras records that this was done by Theodore I Laskaris (ruled 1204‚Äì1222), but George Akropolites asserts this was done by Theodore I's successor, John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1222‚Äì1254) soon after his accession. Modern historians generally consider the latter more probable. In 1224 Andronikos was sent to the region of the Scamander river, just recovered from the Latin Empire, in order to organize its administration as exisotes. This was probably before he was made megas domestikos. In 1233, he was sent as head of the expedition against the semi-independent ruler of Rhodes, the Caesar Leo Gabalas, whom he forced to acknowledge Nicaean suzerainty. In 1241, Andronikos followed John III Vatatztes in his campaigns in Macedonia, and the siege of Thessalonica. The campaign was cut short, however, due to the Mongol invasion of Asia Minor, forcing Vatatzes to content himself with the recognition of his authority by the city's ruler, John Komnenos Doukas, who had formerly claimed the imperial title for himself. In December 1246, following the final capture of Thessalonica, Andronikos was left behind in the city as its governor and as governor-general (referred to as \\"praetor\\" in the sources) of all newly gained Nicaean possessions in Macedonia, while Vatatzes returned to Asia Minor. During his tenure, his eldest son, the future emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, came to serve under him in the cities of Serres and Melenikon. The date of Andronikos' death is unknown. Traditionally it has been dated to 1247, since Akropolites states that it was shortly after his appointment to Thessalonica, but more recent research shows that he died some time between 1248 and 1252. He was succeeded as megas domestikos by his son-in-law Nikephoros Tarchaneiotes, and as governor-general in Thessalonica by Theodore Philes. Family In , he married Theodora. Theodora was of illustrious lineage as the daughter of the despot Alexios Palaiologos and Irene Komnene Angelina, the eldest daughter of the Byzantine emperor Alexios III Angelos. Until his death in 1203, the despot Alexios Palaiologos was also the heir- apparent to the childless Alexios III. Together, the couple had at least four children: Maria (born ), Irene (), Michael (1224/5) and John (after 1225). After Theodora's death, Andronikos remarried, but the name of his second wife is unknown. With her he had another son, Constantine (). With one of his two wives, Andronikos also had a third daughter, whose name is unknown.

Notes on the definition  On the stalk level, the cocycle condition says that the isomorphism F_{gh \\\\cdot x} \\\\simeq F_x is the same as the composition F_{g \\\\cdot h \\\\cdot x} \\\\simeq F_{h \\\\cdot x} \\\\simeq F_x; i.e., the associativity of the group action. The unitarity of a group action is also a consequence: apply (e \\\\times e \\\\times 1)^*, e: S \\\\to G to both sides to get (e \\\\times 1)^* \\\\phi \\\\circ (e \\\\times 1)^* \\\\phi = (e \\\\times 1)^* \\\\phi and so (e \\\\times 1)^* \\\\phi is the identity. Note that \\\\phi is an additional data; it is \\"a lift\\" of the action of G on X to the sheaf F. Moreover, when G is a connected algebraic group, F an invertible sheaf and X is reduced, the cocycle condition is automatic: any isomorphism \\\\sigma^* F \\\\simeq p_2^* F automatically satisfies the cocycle condition (this fact is noted at the end of the proof of Ch. 1, ¬ß 3., Proposition 1.5. of Mumford's \\"geometric invariant theory.\\") If the action of G is free, then the notion of an equivariant sheaf simplifies to a sheaf on the quotient X/G, because of the descent along torsors. By Yoneda's lemma, to give the structure of an equivariant sheaf to an \\\\mathcal{O}_X-module F is the same as to give group homomorphisms for rings R over S, :G(R) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Aut}(X \\\\times_S \\\\operatorname{Spec}R, F \\\\otimes_S R). There is also a definition of equivariant sheaves in terms of simplicial sheaves. Alternatively, one can define an equivariant sheaf to be an equivariant object in the category of, say, coherent sheaves.  Linearized line bundles  A structure of an equivariant sheaf on an invertible sheaf or a line bundle is also called a linearization. Let X be a complete variety over an algebraically closed field acted by a connected reductive group G and L an invertible sheaf on it. If X is normal, then some tensor power L^n of L is linearizable. Also, if L is very ample and linearized, then there is a G-linear closed immersion from X to \\\\mathbf{P}^N such that \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbf{P}^N}(1) is linearized and the linearlization on L is induced by that of \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbf{P}^N}(1). Tensor products and the inverses of linearized invertible sheaves are again linearized in the natural way. Thus, the isomorphism classes of the linearized invertible sheaves on a scheme X form a subgroup of the Picard group of X. See Example 2.16 of for an example of a variety for which most line bundles are not linearizable.  Dual action on sections of equivariant sheaves  Given an algebraic group G and a G-equivariant sheaf F on X over a field k, let V =\\\\Gamma(X, F) be the space of global sections. It then admits the structure of a G-module; i.e., V is a linear representation of G as follows. Writing \\\\sigma: G \\\\times X \\\\to X for the group action, for each g in G and v in V, let :\\\\pi(g)v = (\\\\varphi \\\\circ \\\\sigma^*)(v)(g^{-1}) where \\\\sigma^*: V \\\\to \\\\Gamma(G \\\\times X, \\\\sigma^* F) and \\\\varphi: \\\\Gamma(G \\\\times X, \\\\sigma^* F) \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to \\\\Gamma(G \\\\times X, p_2^* F) = k[G] \\\\otimes_k V is the isomorphism given by the equivariant-sheaf structure on F. The cocycle condition then ensures that \\\\pi: G \\\\to GL(V) is a group homomorphism (i.e., \\\\pi is a representation.) Example: take X = G, F = \\\\mathcal{O}_G and \\\\sigma= the action of G on itself. Then V = k[G], (\\\\varphi \\\\circ \\\\sigma^*)(f)(g, h) = f(gh) and :(\\\\pi(g)f)(h) = f(g^{-1} h), meaning \\\\pi is the left regular representation of G. The representation \\\\pi defined above is a rational representation: for each vector v in V, there is a finite-dimensional G-submodule of V that contains v.  Equivariant vector bundle  A definition is simpler for a vector bundle (i.e., a variety corresponding to a locally free sheaf of constant rank). We say a vector bundle E on an algebraic variety X acted by an algebraic group G is equivariant if G acts fiberwise: i.e., g: E_x \\\\to E_{gx} is a \\"linear\\" isomorphism of vector spaces.If E is viewed as a sheaf, then g needs to be replaced by g^{-1}. In other words, an equivariant vector bundle is a pair consisting of a vector bundle and the lifting of the action G \\\\times X \\\\to X to that of G \\\\times E \\\\to E so that the projection E \\\\to X is equivariant. Just like in the non-equivariant setting, one can define an equivariant characteristic class of an equivariant vector bundle.  Examples  *The tangent bundle of a manifold or a smooth variety is an equivariant vector bundle. *The sheaf of equivariant differential forms. *Let G be a semisimple algebraic group, and Œª:H‚ÜíC a character on a maximal torus H. It extends to a Borel subgroup Œª:B‚ÜíC, giving a one dimensional representation WŒª of B. Then GxWŒª is a trivial vector bundle over G on which B acts. The quotient LŒª=GxBWŒª by the action of B is a line bundle over the flag variety G/B. Note that G‚ÜíG/B is a B bundle, so this is just an example of the associated bundle construction. The Borel-Weil-Bott theorem says that all representations of G arise as the cohomologies of such line bundles. *If X=Spec(A) is an affine scheme, a Gm-action on X is the same thing as a Z grading on A. Similarly, a Gm equivariant quasicoherent sheaf on X is the same thing as a Z graded A module.

While the history of supply and transport services is as old as the history of organized warfare itself it was in 1760 that the very rudimentary supply and transport organizations of the three presidencies of the East India Company were brought under the council of a single authority. Role and non-operational status The Indian Army Service Corps Flag (used after independence) 220x220px Indian Mule Corps in 220x220px The Army Service Corps is mainly responsible for the provisioning, procurement and distribution of supplies of food ration, fresh & dry eatable items, FOL (fuels, oil, lubricants), hygiene chemicals and items of hospital comforts to Army, Air Force and when required Navy and other paramilitary forces. Other responsibilities include the operation of mechanical transport except first line transport and fighting vehicles. ASC is responsible for provision and operation of first and second line animal transport; carriage and distribution of ammunition including mines; corps maintenance area in case of plains, divisional maintenance area in case of mountain formation; packing of commodities for supply; loading of aircraft and ejection of loads; training and provisioning of clerks for all branches of staff at formation headquarters; training and provisioning of catering staff in the army; and postal services in forward areas. Officers in the Army Serivce Corps are not considered combatant officers by the Army. Officers from the Army Service Corps along with other services corps believe their designation as \\"non operational\\" is discriminatory, depriving service corps officers of the pay and promotion opportunities of combat officers. In 2017, the media reported widespread insubordination among service corps officers who refused to accept field postings in forward and counter-insurgency areas due to claims of discrimination. History The origin of the corps go back to 1760 when a Commissariat used to exist in the administrative component of the armies three Presidencies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay. In 1878 the separate Commissariats were amalgamated into a single entity and then in 1901 it was renamed the Supply and Transport Corps. During the First World War the corps became a permanent component of the British Indian Army and was renamed the Indian Army Service Corps in 1923. In 1935 the corps was granted the 'Royal' prefix and became known as Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). After India gained independence in 1947, the corps underwent further expansion and by 1948 Indian Catering Corps and Indian Army Corps of Clerks were amalgamated into the corps. The Food Testing Laboratories were also placed under the control of RIASC. On 8 December 1950, after India became a republic, the corps dropped the use of the 'Royal' prefix and was once again renamed the Indian Army Service Corps. Since that day the corps has celebrated its Raising Day on 8 December. On 8 December 1967 the first colours of the ASC were presented by President Zakir Hussain. Corruption cases=Generals Since the 2000s there have been several cases of corruption by senior leaders in the Army Service Corps and Army Ordnance Corps, another logistical support branch of the Army. The Times of India called the corruption cases in the Army Service Corps and Army Ordnance Corps an \\"indicator of declining standards of probity and discipline in the armed forces\\". The Army Service Corps has gained a reputation for offering abundant opportunities for graft. A commentary by Major General (Retd) Ashok Kumar Mehta on growth of corruption in the Army ranks referred to \\"the habitual culprits from the supply corps\\". In 2007, Lieutenant General S.K. Dahiya was found in disciplinary proceedings to have supplied expired meat to soldiers in Ladakh. At the time of the alleged fraud Dahiya had been a Major General at Army Services Corps at Northern Command in Udhampur. In 2011, retired Lieutenant General S. K. Sahni of the Army Service Corps was found in disciplinary proceedings to have supplied Army units in high altitude areas with rotten rations from a favored vendor. Sahni had been director general of supplies and transport before his retirement in 2006. In 2013, a supplier made an allegation of corruption against a Major General responsible for rations and supplies to troops in the Northern Command. The officer had amassed wealth including valuable investments in real estate and gold and had nearly ‚Çπ65 lakh in a bank account in excess of known income. In 2016, Major General Ashok Kumar of the Army Service Corps in Kolkata was investigated for bribery and having assets disproportionate to income. Other officers Groups of officers and other personnel in the Army Services Corps and Army units being supplied have been implicated in webs of corruption. In 2018, a contractor allegedly paid bribes worth ‚Çπ82 lakh to Lt Col Amit Sharma and Lt Col Sutikshan Rana, officers of the Army Service Corps, to win business supply rations to troops in Nagaland. Both officers had successively held the job of commanding officer of the Army Service Corps (Supply) Type 'C' at Dimapur between 2012 and 2016. The bribes had been deposited in bank accounts of people who were close to family members of the officers. The officer who initiated the corruption complaint claimed there was a \\"magnitude of corruption is much more than what has been revealed by Army investigations.\\" In 2019, a Colonel who served as Commanding Officer of the 556 Army Supply Corps and four other Army personnel were accused of taking ‚Çπ18 lakh worth of bribes from a Tawang-based supplier for rations distributed to troops in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The Colonel had allegedly taken a bribe of ‚Çπ4.15 lakh paid by the supplier to the account of the Colonel's father. Others taking bribes in the alleged conspiracy included ‚Çπ1 lakh to a Lieutenant Colonel responsible for quality checks, ‚Çπ2.04 lakh and ‚Çπ7.65 lakh to two junior officers respectively and ‚Çπ98,000 to a Havildar. It is believed by the case investigators that \\"an entire chain of officials and unit representatives involved in checking of quality and quantity of items\\".

Life Prishtina was born in Prishtina, in the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He took the first studies in his home town in Turkish language, studying later in Uskub school \\"Dar ul- Mualimin\\". He studied law and education in Istanbul, first in the Private Pegagogical Schools \\"Dar√ºttedris\\" and later in the \\"Fatih\\" Medrese. On February 4, 1902 he joined the Young Turks movement. In 1904 he was arrested by Ottoman authorities because of his refusals to point to the author of \\"Fitret ul-Isl√¢m\\", a problematic and controversial essay on the Islam religion, with Syrja Bey Vlora as author. He spent four years in Yedikule prison where he lost a leg due to gangrene. After his released he was interned in Tokat in north-eastern Anatolia where he worked as a lawyer. With the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 his persecution ended and he was sent in Samsun by the Black Sea to finish his studies. In 1911 he became professor of law, and was appointed in 1913 to work at the Bank of Istanbul, after that being expelled from Turkey. During World War I he was stationed in Shkod√´r, north-west Albanian town. He formed there an organization called \\"Komiteti i Fsheht√´\\" (Secret Committee) with a nationalistic programme. He was one of the founders of the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo, and was officially its leader for the time it operated based on Shkod√´r. Prishtina would be also in charge of representing the Committee in meetings and keeping correspondence for foreign factors. His deputy was Hysni Curri, and Bedri Pejani served as Committee's secretary. He was appointed Minister of Justice of the Albanian government coming out of the Congress of Lushnj√´. In 1921 he was Deputy Chairman of the Albanian Parliament. In December 1921 he was again appointed Minister of Justice of the short-lived government of Hasan Prishtina. Several schools and streets in Albania and Kosovo bear his name. As a publisher In 1921, Prishtina published in Shkod√´r the newspaper Udha e s√´ V√´rtet√´s (Road of the truth).

The pond's name refers to Cushing's proposal that the people of Key Marco had lived on pile dwellings over the water, based on his finds of toppled pilings. The Pepper‚ÄìHearst expedition of 1895‚Äì1897 on the west coast of Florida was sponsored by Dr. William Pepper and philanthropist Phoebe Hearst, and led by the anthropologist Frank Hamilton Cushing. The pre‚ÄìColumbian finds demonstrate a Shell Age phase of human development and culture.  Background  In 1895, Pepper took steps to investigate the existence of interesting remains near Tarpon Springs, Florida after Lt. Col. Charles Day Durnford reported on them. An expedition was organized, the expense of which was defrayed jointly by Pepper and Hearst. By special agreement with the Bureau of American Ethnology, the expedition was placed under the direction of Cushing, a patient of Pepper's, with the understanding that the Smithsonian Institution should receive duplicates when such were found, and should publish the scientific results of the expedition, to be known as the \\"Pepper‚ÄìHearst Expedition.\\"  First reconnaissance  In May 1895, with two men and a little fishing sloop, Cushing began exploration of the islands and capes of Charlotte Harbor, Pine Island Sound, Caloosa Bay, and the lower more open coast as far as Key Marco, approximately away to the southward. At Key Marco, Cushing discovered a small, triangular, pond which he named, \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\". It lay close alongside the sea-wall at the southwestern edge of the key and just below a succession of shell benches, themselves formerly abandoned and filled-up courts of a similar character. The side opposite the seawall, on the east, was formed by an extended ridge ‚Äì scarcely less high than the sea-wall itself, and likewise composed of well- compacted shells. Around the upper end, and down the outer side of this ridge, led an inlet canal, bordered by similar ridges beyond, and joined by an outlet canal at the lower end ‚Äì that continued through various low-banked enclosures in the mangrove swamps toward the south, down to the terminus of the seawall itself.  Organization  Upon Cushing's return from the First Reconnaissance, Pepper, with the aid of several of friends and associates, made plans to fit out Cushing, during the following winter, an expedition for the more complete exploration of the region. Jacob Disston volunteered his schooner, the Silver Spray, belonging to a fleet of sponging vessels at Tarpon Springs. Major John Wesley Powell, Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology, provisionally granted leave to Cushing, and promised official recognition and assistance in the conduct of the proposed expedition in the joint interest of the Bureau itself, and of the Department of Archaeology of the University of Pennsylvania. Funds were placed at Cushing's disposal by Pepper in November 1896. Wells M. Sawyer volunteered to be the expedition's artist and photographer while Irving Sayford agreed to be its Field Secretary. Carl F. W. Bergmann, Preparator of Collections in the United States National Museum, also agreed to join the expedition. The Clyde Line Steamship Company furnished passes for the expeditionary members from New York City to Jacksonville; they left Washington on December 4, 1896. Cushing and his wife left overland, and joined the group at Jacksonville from where they proceeded via Sanford, to Tarpon Springs.  Operations at Key Marco  Frank Hamilton Cushing The Silver Spray set sail in February 1897. In addition to Sawyer, Sayford and Bergmann, Cushing's crew consisted of Antonio Gomez, Sailing Master; Thomas Brady, Mate; Alfred Hudson, Robert Clark and Frank Barnes, Sailors and Excavators; George Gause, Chief Excavator; George Hudson, Cook; and George Dorsett, Steward. Cushing later employed John Calhoun continuously, and other workmen, from time to time, to assist in the excavations. Immediately on arriving at Key Marco, Cushing made arrangements to be permitted to retain all objects discovered, and if desirable, to exploit the little triangular \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" from border to border. Three or four of the team worked side by side in each section, digging inch by inch, and foot by foot, horizontally through the muck and rich lower strata, standing or crouching in puddles of mud and water. After the first day's work, Cushing had no doubt as to the unique outcome of the excavations, or as to the desirability of searching through the entire contents of the court. Relics not only of the kind previously discovered, but of new and even more interesting varieties began at once to be found, and continued to be found day after day, throughout the entire five weeks of work in the one locale. Cushing stated, \\"that never in all my life, despite the sufferings this labor involved, was I so fascinated with or interested in anything so much, as in the finds thus daily revealed\\". The objects found in these deposits were in various conditions of preservation, from those which looked fresh and almost new, to those which could be hardly distinguished from the briny peat mire where they were embedded. They consisted of wood, cordage and like perishable materials associated with implements and ornaments of more enduring substances, such as shell, bone and horn. Only a few shaped of stone were encountered during the entire search. Articles of wood far outnumbered all others. Many of these had been painted with black, white, gray-blue, and brownish-red pigments. Unique to archaeology as these things were, Cushing was distressed to feel that even by merely exposing and inspecting them, the expedition was dooming so many of them to destruction, rather than preserving them as permanent examples of primitive art. There were a few groups of utensils, like mortar cups and pestles, and sets of tools; and there were also some bundles or packs of ceremonial objects.  Archaeological finds  The pre‚ÄìColumbian finds represent collections of a Shell Age phase of human development and culture.  Buildings  Larger timbers, like the comparatively gigantic sill, which lay along the edge of the northern bench, were absolutely intact. They were excellent examples of primitive joinery. Some of the broad, notched staves‚Äîwhich Cushing judged had been used as symbolic ancestral tablets, probably attached to the gables of houses, or set up in altars‚Äîlay on their edges. Flat boards sometimes stood on end, and other long, slender articles, stood slantingly upward, the lowermost ends or edges firmly stuck in the clay- marl of the bottom.  Objects  Key Marco Cat, excavated at Key Marco in 1896, on display at the Smithsonian Institution There were seats made from flat slabs of wood from in length, slightly hollowed on top from end to end as well as from side to side, with rounded bottoms and substantial, prong-like pairs of feet near either end, from long. Some of these stools had the feet level while others were spread and beveled so that they would fit in the hollow bottoms of canoes. Portions of mats, some thick, as though for use as rugs, others enveloping various objects, and others still of shredded bark in strips so thin and flat and closely platted that they might well have served as sails, were frequently discovered, yet none of them could be preserved. It was obvious, however, that the peoples who had inhabited the court understood well, not only platting, but weaving and basketry-making too. A few examples of pottery were discovered, showing evidence of having been used as cooking bowls or pots. Associated with them were household utensils‚Äî spoons made from bivalves, ladles made from the greater halves of hollowed-out well-grown conch shells; and cups, bowls, trays and mortars of wood. Trays were comparatively shallow, oval in outline and varying in length; the ends were narrowed and truncated to form handles, the upper faces of which were usually decorated with neatly cut-in disc-like or semilunar figures or depressions. Atlatls and arrows were found, but no bows. There were a considerable variety of war clubs, as well as dirks made from the foreleg bones of deer. Personal ornaments and paraphernalia, miscellaneous ceremonial appliances, sacred and symbolical objects, carvings and paintings, as well as masks and figureheads were also described among the expedition's finds.  Aftermath  The results,‚Äîthe discovery, at Key Marco and Demorey Key, of ancient Floridan pile dwellings and of a highly specialized civilization,‚Äî created a sensation among Americanists. The original series was arranged and exhibited at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology while a duplicate but representative series of the pre‚ÄìColumbian artifacts 2343 displayed at the National Museum at Washington. Cushing's death occurred before the publication of the memoir.

Although the French attacked first, they were unable to dislodge an Austrian flanking column. Afterward Jourdan's army retreated to the north. The clash happened during the War of the First Coalition, part of a wider conflict known as the French Revolutionary Wars. Modern-day H√∂chst is a suburb and administrative district of Frankfurt am Main in the state of Hesse in Germany. H√∂chst is about west of the Frankfurt city center. In 1795 the French employed two independent armies in thrusts across the Rhine. After winning a bridgehead on the east bank, the northern French army under Jean- Baptiste Jourdan advanced south to the Main River. At this point, the commander of the southern French army, Jean-Charles Pichegru proved uncooperative. This allowed Clerfayt to move the bulk of the Austrian forces against Jourdan. Clerfayt crossed the Main to the east, gaining a dangerously exposed position on the French left flank. After being repulsed at H√∂chst, the French withdrew northward, eventually abandoning the east bank of the Rhine altogether. The next actions were the Siege of Mannheim, on 19 October, and the Battle of Mainz on 29 October. Background In the fall of 1795, the French Directory ordered General of Division Jean-Baptiste Jourdan with the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse and General of Division Jean-Charles Pichegru with the Army of the Rhine and Moselle to launch converging assaults across the Rhine. While Jourdan attacked in the north near D√ºsseldorf, Pichegru could mount his offensive anywhere in the south between Mannheim and Strasbourg. The operations were designed to catch Feldmarschall Count of Clerfayt's defending Austrian army in a great pincer. Between the two thrusts, the Siege of Mainz dragged on. Several French divisions led by General of Division Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber placed the Fortress of Mainz under blockade on 14 December 1794, but the French lacked the heavy artillery to reduce the city's defenses. In any case, the French were unable to encircle the city since the Austrians held the east bank of the Rhine. Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber On 8 September 1795, Jourdan got his army across the Rhine north of D√ºsseldorf. By the 20th, the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse swept south as far as the Lahn River. Hemmed in by General of Division Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre and 12,600 French troops, Count Hompesch surrendered the Bavarian garrison at D√ºsseldorf on 21 September. After agreeing not to fight the French for one year, the 2,000 Bavarians were permitted to march home, but the city and 168 fortress guns fell into French hands. Threatened by Jourdan's incursion, Clerfayt began shifting his army north to oppose him. This movement gave Pichegru an opportunity. Despite having a 9,200-man Bavarian garrison, Baron von Belderbusch turned over Mannheim and its 471 guns to the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle after negotiations. The Austrians were furious at their ally but could do nothing to prevent their enemies from gaining this valuable bridgehead. The 1795 campaign marked a change in the relationship between generals at the front and the French government. Since the downfall of the Committee of Public Safety and the end of the Reign of Terror in July 1794, the power of the representatives on mission over army generals had declined. When a representative tried to meddle with a troop deployment in September 1795, Lefebvre brusquely overrode the man's objections. The fall of Mannheim presented Pichegru with an opportunity to capture Clerfayt's supply base at Heidelberg. This coup might have compelled the Austrian general to retreat. Instead, Pichegru only sent two divisions under Georges Joseph Dufour and Jean-Jacques Ambert to seize the town. When the two French divisions advanced with the Neckar river between them, Austrian Feldmarschall-Leutnant Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich concentrated most of his troops against Dufour's division. On 24 September, Quosdanovich's 8,000 men overcame 12,000 French soldiers when an Austrian cavalry charge led by Johann von Klenau rode down Dufour's division at the Battle of Handschuhsheim. The bloodied French withdrew to Mannheim. At this point, Pichegru and Jourdan conferred on a plan to push the Austrians out of the region. Jourdan wanted to mass the two French armies near Mannheim, placing them between Clerfayt's army and a second Austrian army under General der Kavallerie Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser that was advancing from the south. Using the strategy of the central position, Jourdan hoped to defeat the Austrian armies one after the other. Pichegru rejected the plan, and both generals waited upon new orders from Paris. While they were waiting, Clerfayt took his Habsburg army south to block further moves by Pichegru against his Heidelberg base. In response, Jourdan ordered his army to move south to the Main River. This move completely isolated Mainz by surrounding it from both sides of the Rhine. Battle On 1 October 1795, the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse consisted of the divisions of Generals of Division Lefebvre, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Jean √âtienne Championnet, Claude-Sylvestre Colaud, Louis Friant, Paul Grenier, Louis-Auguste Juv√©nal des Ursins d'Harville, Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers, Antoine Morlot, Andr√© Poncet and Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly. However, four divisions were guarding rear areas. Colaud's 8,911 men were posted at D√ºsseldorf, Friant's 3,296 troops were garrisoning Luxembourg City, Marceau's 11,240 soldiers were besieging the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress near Koblenz and Morlot's 3,471 men were holding Aachen.Smith (1998), p. 101 Jourdan's 63,615-strong field army was deployed in the following locations. Bernadotte's 8,223 soldiers were at Biberach (Biebrich) watching Kassel (Mainz-Kastel) on the east side of Mainz. Championnet's 9,816 troops were guarding the west side of Mainz. Tilly's 9,861 men were at Herdenheim and Helsheim, which cannot be located on a modern map. The remaining troops were posted on the north bank of the Main. From west to east the defenders were Poncet's 9,384 men between Wickert (Wicker) and Wilbach (Weilbach), Grenier's 11,150 troops at Weilsbach (Weilbach) and Lefebvre's 12,618 soldiers between Selsheim (Zeilsheim) and Niederliederbach (Unterliederbach). Harville's 1,593-strong cavalry reserve was at Marxheim and Langenheim. From Biebrich to Unterliederbach, Jourdan's line ran . Jean Baptiste Jourdan The order of battle for Army of Sambre-et-Meuse divisions was as follows. Bernadotte had the 21st Light and 71st, 111th and 123rd Line Demi-Brigades plus the 1st, 6th and 9th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments in brigades under Generals of Brigade Charles Daurier and Gabriel Barbou. Championnet had the 59th, 132nd and 181st Line Demi-Brigades plus the 1st and 12th Dragoon Regiments in brigades under Generals of Brigade Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand and Louis Klein. Tilly had the 23rd, 27th and 72nd Line Demi-Brigades and the Yonne National Garde plus the 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment in brigades under Generals of Brigade Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge and Bernard √âtienne Marie Duvignau. Poncet had the 53rd, 87th, 66th and 116th Line Demi-Brigades plus the 7th and 11th Dragoon Regiments in brigades under Generals of Brigade Jean Joseph Schlachter and Nicolas Soult. Grenier had the 110th, 173rd, 112th and 172nd Line Demi- Brigades plus the 19th Chasseurs √† Cheval and 4th Hussar Regiments in brigades under Generals of Brigade Henri Simon, Jean Baptiste Olivier and Christophe Oswald. Lefebvre had the 10th and 13th Light and the 8th, 90th and 119th Line Demi-Brigades plus the 1st, 6th and 9th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments in brigades under Generals of Brigade Jean Fran√ßois Leval, Jean Baptiste Jacopin and Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul. The demi brigades usually consisted of three battalions each. Harville led the 6th, 8th, 10th and 13th Cavalry Regiments. Map of the Nidda River basin Wurmser's army arrived in the theater and by 10 October 1795 it approached Mannheim. With no pressure from Pichegru, Clerfayt had a chance to deal with Jourdan alone. He moved his army northeast from Heppenheim to Aschaffenburg, another suburb of Frankfurt. Turning to the northwest, the Austrian army reached Offenbach am Main on 10 October. By modern roads, this route is . Ignoring Frankfurt's neutrality, Clerfayt's troops crossed the Main, circled around the east side of the city and advanced west along the south bank of the Nidda River. On 11 and 12 October 1795, 10,000 French troops commanded by Kl√©ber tried to overpower an Austrian force defending the line of the Nidda near its confluence with the Main. The 5,500 defenders, commanded by General-major Adam Boros de R√°kos, consisted of one battalion of the Jordis Infantry Regiment Nr. 59, two battalions and four squadrons of the Wurmser Freikorps, six companies of the Warasdiner Grenz infantry (border infantry), three companies of the Gr√ºn-Laudon Freikorps, two companies of Tyrolean sharpshooters and two squadrons of the Waldeck Dragoon Regiment Nr. 39. Despite persistent French assaults, Boros' men held their ground and inflicted losses of 500 killed and wounded on their opponents. The Austrians lost 24 killed and 201 wounded. The French division involved was either Bernadotte's or Championnet's.Smith (1998), p. 105 Jourdan convened a council of war and a decision was made to retreat back across the Rhine. On 13 October at Niedernhausen in the Taunus hills the Austrians attacked the 5,000-man French rear guard in a severe clash. Generals of Brigade Klein and Charles Joseph Boy√© led six infantry battalions, three cavalry regiments and three artillery pieces. They faced a total of 8,000 Austrians in Boros' command plus General-major Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf's Observazionkorps. Nauendorf's troops included two unidentified infantry battalions, four squadrons of Blankenstein Hussar Regiment Nr. 16, two squadrons of W√ºrzburg Dragoon Regiment and two squadrons of Bercs√©ny Hussars, a royalist French √âmigr√© unit. The Republican French force dispersed with the loss of 334 killed and wounded, 134 missing, five guns and 111 wagons, including 80 carrying ammunition. Austrian losses are unknown.Smith (1998), p. 106 Two days later, the French got the better of another rear guard action at Steinbach. A portion of Clerfayt's Observazionkorps under General-major Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak was driven off by the rearguard of Lefebvre's division. The Austrians suffered losses of 92 casualties and three field pieces captured. French losses are not known. Rather than mount an aggressive pursuit, Clerfayt held the bulk of his army behind the Nidda for five days after the battle on the 11th. The French left wing retreated to D√ºsseldorf, the center to Bonn, and the right wing to Neuwied. The withdrawal of the right was interrupted when the Neuwied bridge burned on 19 October. By this time, Clerfayt decided to throw his weight against the French forces at Mainz. Results The French withdrawal forced Marceau to lift the siege of Ehrenbreitstein on 17 October 1795. Marceau had under his command the 9th Light and 1st, 21st, 26th and 178th Line Demi-Brigades, the 31st Gendsarme Battalion and the 11th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment. His brigades were led by Generals of Brigade Gilbert Jacques Naleche and Jean Hardy. The 2,600-man Ehrenbreitstein garrison included one infantry battalion and two Jager companies from the Archbishopric of Trier, one battalion of the Austrian Murray Infantry Regiment Nr. 55, gunners and sappers. Few casualties were suffered on either side.Smith (1998), pp. 107-108 The fortess commander was Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) Johann Sechter who was promoted to Oberst (colonel) on 6 November 1795. By 20 October, the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse was back on the west bank of the Rhine, with its center around Koblenz. By this time Wurmser had begun the French-occupied Mannheim. With the two French armies widely separated, the French at Mainz were unsupported. Clerfayt launched a powerful attack on the French lines and won the Battle of Mainz on 29 October. Turning south against Pichegru, the Austrian commander defeated the French at the Battle of Pfeddersheim on 10 November and Frankenthal on 14 November, isolating Mannheim. The Austrians successfully wrapped up the Siege of Mannheim on 22 November. The poor showing of the French was likely caused by the treachery of Pichegru, who had expensive tastes and greater ambitions. The general accepted money from a British agent and was in contact with persons who wished for a return to the French monarchy. Despite reason for suspicion, he remained in command of the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle until March 1796, when he resigned. He returned to Paris where he was popular. His replacement in army command was General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau.Rothenberg (1980), p. 39 NotesReferences   * * Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles in Hesse Category:Conflicts in 1795 ","title":"Battle of H√∂chst (1795)"},{"id":"41883591","text":"Charles Cary may refer to: * Charles P.

The business  In 1921 S√©n√©chal founded the automotive business that bore his name at Courbevoie. The origins of the business went back to the \\"Eclair\\" cyclecar business in which S√©n√©chal had briefly been involved. S√©n√©chal was himself a celebrity in the automotive world, and his cycle cars were an immediate success. It was impossible to satisfy demand for the vehicles from the manufacturer's small premises at Courbevoie, and S√©n√©chal therefore negotiated a deal with Chenard & Walcker, who had no model of their own in the cyclecar class and from 1923 agreed to take on the manufacturing of the S√©n√©chal models. As the economy grew the cyclecar boom that had driven the earlier \\"Eclair\\" and \\"S√©n√©chal\\" businesses, and S√©n√©chal moved up a notch to become a producer of light cars in the voiturette class. In 1925 the name of the business changed from S√©n√©chal to Soci√©t√© Industrielle et Commerciale, and the business was taken over by Chenard & Walcker.Harald Linz, Halwart Schrader: Die Internationale Automobil-Enzyklop√§die.

Engines were bought in from specialists such as Ruby, and, less frequently, Train or Chapuis-Dornier By the time of the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924, the S√©n√©chal range comprised two cyclecars. These were a 6 HP model with a 972cc engine and a 7HP with an 1100 cc power unit. The two of them sat respectively on wheelbases of and , and were priced by the manufacturer at 12,600 francs and 14,900 francs. There was again a S√©n√©chal stand at the 22ndMotor Show in October 1928, now advertising two voiturettes fitted with Chenard & Walcker engines of 7HP (1100 cc) and 9HP (1500 cc).

She displaced 736 tons and had 26 guns. She was long, with a beam of and a draught of . Career 240px In October 1585 King Philip II of Spain decided to invade England. The Armada (fleet) would travel from Spain to the Netherlands, from where it would escort the invading army under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. The San Esteban was assigned to the Guipuzcoa Squadron commanded by Almirante Miguel de Oquendo y Segura. Her captain was Don Felipe de C√≥rdoba. She carried 196 soldiers and 68 mariners. The Armada set sail from Corunna on 19 July 1588, and entered the English Channel on 30 July. The fleet was attacked by English ships repeatedly as it ran through the channel, and on the night of 7‚Äì8 August was attacked by fire ships. On 8 August there was a confused fight off Gravelines. During this engagement the wind carried the Armada into the North Sea. It was not possible for it to return to escort Parma's troops, so the Spanish were forced to abandon the enterprise. The Armada attempted to return to Spain by sailing north, rounding Scotland, and returning along the west coast of Ireland. However, their charts were inaccurate and the Spanish were sailing in unfamiliar waters. 26 of the 128 ships were wrecked on the Irish coast. The San Esteban was wrecked on 20 September 1588 near the mouth of the Doonbeg River, western Ireland. The same day the San Marcos was wrecked near what is now called Spanish Point, Clare, and the Annunciada in the Scattery roads of the Shannon Estuary. Aftermath Sixty men managed to reach shore from the San Esteban. Some of the survivors were killed when they reached land by the local people or by the English soldiers. Others, including four from the San Marcos, were taken captive by Boetius Clancy, High Sheriff of Clare, and held at his castle near Spanish Point. He arranged for all the prisoners to be hung at Cnoc na Crocaire near Spanish Point. They were buried in a mass grave that continues to be called Tuama na Spaineach (Tomb of the Spanish).

A. Bassarabescu; December 17, 1870 - March 27, 1952) was a Romanian comedic writer, civil servant and politician, who served one term (1926‚Äì1927) in the Senate of Romania. His work, mainly in prose form, is remembered as an accomplished and noteworthy contribution to Romanian literature, capturing the dreary life of provincial clerks in the early 20th century. Not interested in producing a singular novel, like his mentor Gustave Flaubert, he concentrated instead on the sketch story genre. In his debut stage, Bassarabescu belonged to Junimea, the mainly literary and politically conservative club. He was friends with Titu Maiorescu, Junimea leader, and with the Junimist author Ioan Alexandru BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti (with whom he is often compared). Married into a political family, Bassarabescu had joined the Conservative Party by 1906, and, although still mainly active as a teacher, received high appointments in the bureaucracy. During World War I, Bassarabescu he supported the Central Powers and was even appointed Prefect of Prahova County under a German-led occupation. This put his political career on hold until 1925, when he joined the People's Party. Moving into right-wing populism in the 1930s, Bassarabescu had stints in the National Agrarian Party and the National Christian Party, and joined the official National Renaissance Front in 1939. His last years were spent in seclusion: losing his fortune to Allied carpet bombing, stripped of his Romanian Academy membership by the communist regime, he died suddenly in a road accident. Biography=Early life and debut Bassarabescu descended from boyar families that occupied court positions in Wallachia: his father, Alecu, was a pitar; his mother, Elisa, was the daughter of a staroste, relatives with General Romulus Boteanu.CƒÉlinescu, p. 581 Alecu had received a progressive education at the Saint Sava Academy; his colleagues there later instigated the 1848 Revolution in Wallachia.CƒÉlinescu, p. 581; Eftimiu, p. 462 Although he had settled in the Danube port of Giurgiu, his own family was more closely associated with Bucharest, the national capital. Noted members of this branch include Nicolae \\"Nae\\" Bassarabescu, who worked as a journalist in the liberal-radical press,Eftimiu, p. 462 later setting up the first newsstand chain in town, and composer George Bassarabescu. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Bucure»ôtii doctorului VƒÉtƒÉmanu\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 3-4/2009 One of the couple's seven children, Ioan Alecu was born in Giurgiu, an ethnic Romanian baptized into the Romanian Orthodox Church. Vasile Pop-Luca, \\"Arhiva Revistei Rom√¢ne. Fondul N. I. Herescu\\", in Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ (ASTRA), Nr. 4/2003 In 1877, the family left the city because of Ottoman bombardments during the Romanian War of Independence, settling in Bucharest. Bogdan Vladu, \\"Giurgiu »ôi masoneria\\", in AdevƒÉrul Giurgiu edition, November 7, 2013 The eight-year-old Bassarabescu was first enlisted at school in Bucharest's Yellow Ward, and later in the Green Ward. Enrolled at Saint Sava National College, Bassarabescu was classmates with various intellectual luminaries and political figures of his generation, among them Constantin Banu, Ion Livescu and Scarlat OrƒÉscu.Livescu, pp. 7, 299‚Äì300 Influenced by their teacher, classical scholar Anghel Demetriescu, they formed their own literary club, which held its meetings in the Saint Sava basement.Livescu, pp. 7, 300. See also Eftimiu, p. 463 Together, they put out the makeshift literary review Armonia, described by an aging Bassarabescu as polygraphed \\"with the faintest and least readable violet letters to have ever been used for writing in this world.\\"Livescu, pp. 299‚Äì300 It was soon replaced by a less makeshift periodical, the bi-monthly Studentul Rom√¢n. Bassarabescu published his first short stories in that paper, and then in the youth review Genera»õia Viitoare, before being hosted (with words of praise and encouragement) by the literary supplement of Rom√¢nul newspaper.Eftimiu, p. 463 Studentul Rom√¢n only put out three issues, closing down due to a \\"lack of funds\\", but not, as Bassarabescu quipped, to a \\"lack of scientific and literary contributions\\".Livescu, p. 300 By this time, the Saint Sava pupils began attending literary- and social-themed conferences at the Romanian Atheneum. It was there that Bassarabescu met the successful writer Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ, who gave him some of his first literary pointers.Petre Hane»ô, \\"Fapte »ôi comentarii. I. A. Bassarabescu despre Al. Vlahu»õƒÉ\\", in PreocupƒÉri Literare, Nr. 5/1942, p. 270 Soon, Bassarabescu's pieces were hosted by Revista NouƒÉ, a literary journal managed by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu (1893).CƒÉlinescu, p. 581; Eftimiu, p. 463 This was an impressive feat, to judge by Bassarabescu's own words: \\"imposingly grand\\" and \\"too expensive\\" venture, Revista NouƒÉ had fascinated him and his Saint Sava colleagues. He also dabbled in parodic poetry, some of which was published by the Symbolist review, Literatorul. By 1896, after such permutations, Bassarabescu was firmly affiliated with Junimea, contributing to the Junimist tribune, Convorbiri Literare, and cultivating a friendship with its founder, Titu Maiorescu.Boia (2010), p. 165 Like his generational colleague Ioan Alexandru BrƒÉtescu- Voine»ôti, Bassarabescu joined in just as the Convorbiri Literare, for long disregarded by Maiorescu, was entering its decline stage. As noted by literary historian Zigu Ornea, the stories of Bassarabescu and BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti were a rare diversion, the magazine having grown \\"monotonous\\", \\"suffocated by bulky specialized studies\\".Ornea, pp. 113, 120 Bassarabescu was not dissuaded by such problems: he would contribute to the magazine throughout most of his life. He managed to impress a wide range of professionals, from the Junimist novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu (who guessed in him a future \\"great writer\\") to the independent Ilarie Chendi.Eftimiu, pp. 463‚Äì464 Between his move from Revista NouƒÉ to Junimea, Bassarabescu had enlisted at the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of the University of Bucharest (graduated 1897), while also working as a Finance Ministry clerk. At around that time, he had moved to Ploie»ôti city, Prahova, where he would live for most of his life, and became a teacher of geography and French. Various sources have it that his relocation occurred in 1896 or 1897, but, according to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, Bassarabescu had spent 1898 working as a substitute teacher in Foc»ôani. Around that moment, his work appeared in the review Noutatea, put out in Ia»ôi by Berman Goldner-Giordano. Victor Durnea, \\"Pseudonimele lui G. IbrƒÉileanu. Colaborator la Noutatea (Ia»ôi, 1897)\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 11/2008 Political and literary rise Temelie Dinescu and Bassarabescu's residence in Ploie»ôti In January 1900, with the start of a new Convorbiri Literare series, Bassarabescu was co-opted onto the journal's editorial committee, overseen by geographer Grigore Antipa.Ornea, pp. 119‚Äì120 According to Ornea, the panel membership evidenced in itself that political Junimism had mutated into eclecticism: Antipa was a National Liberal, and one regular member, Dimitrie Voinov, a socialist.Ornea, p. 120 Like other Convorbiri Literare contributors, Bassarabescu saw his work published in the more radical right- wing SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul magazine, but he did not necessarily identify with the SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul agenda.CƒÉlinescu, p. 601. See also Lovinescu, p. 201 He was invited to publish there by his mentor Vlahu»õƒÉ, who rewarded his contribution with an original canvas by painter Nicolae Grigorescu. In 1903, he answered a similar call from Livescu, publishing in the new magazine Revista Teatrelor.Livescu, p. 34 Politically, he leaned toward the mainstream Conservative Party, which had Maiorescu as chief doctrinaire. It is probable that Bassarabescu began frequenting the Ploie»ôti Conservative chapter in or around 1901, making friends with political boss Temelie Dinescu, and courting his intellectual daughter, Ecaterina Dinescu. Paul D. Popescu, \\"Femei prahovene de azi, de ieri »ôi mai de demult ‚Äì Ecaterina Bassarabescu (I)\\", in Ziarul Prahova, December 14, 2010 From about 1906, he registered formally with the Conservative Party. In April 1904, Bassarabescu married Ecaterina Dinescu. The modest ceremony was compensated by a sizable dowry (including a family home on R. Stanian Street) and a honeymoon in Venice. Paul D. Popescu, \\"Femei prahovene de azi, de ieri »ôi mai de demult ‚Äì Ecaterina Bassarabescu (II)\\", in Ziarul Prahova, December 21, 2010 Temelie Dinescu died just four months after the event, leaving them ownership of another home, located on a street that was named in his honor. Some time after, Ecaterina gave birth to a daughter, Maria-Elisabeta (whom both parents nicknamed Cire»ôica, \\"Little Cherry\\"). The first bound collection of Bassarabescu's novellas and stories was released (as Nuvele) in 1903, with Editura Socec. In 1907, Editura Minerva and Biblioteca pentru to»õi published two other selections, Vulturii (\\"The Eagles\\") and Norocul (\\"Luck\\").CƒÉlinescu, p. 1007 With Mihail Sadoveanu, A. de Herz, Emil G√¢rleanu, George Ranetti and some others, he was employed by the National Theater Bucharest to work on professional translations of comedy and drama. As Livescu recounts, this was a project heralded by manager Pompiliu Eliade, who had recently been \\"appalled\\" by the poor-quality translations already in circulation.Livescu, pp. 93‚Äì94 Bassarabescu was assigned to work on comedies by Georges Courteline, and, Livescu argues, did an \\"excellent\\" job.Livescu, pp. 111, 144 In 1908, Socec published his adaptation of a 15th-century farce, Master Pierre Pathelin (as Ovidiu »òicanƒÉ). His wife also wrote poetry and prose, published in reviews such as LuceafƒÉrul, Convorbiri Critice or Epoca, usually under the pen name of Irena Mohor. During those years, the Bassarabescu family played host to a long succession of writers visiting Ploie»ôti. Bassarabescu became rather close friends with two senior figures on the cultural scene: the Ploie»ôti literary theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea and satirist Ion Luca Caragiale.Eftimiu, p. 464 In March 1908, Bassarabescu affiliated with the prototype Romanian Writers' Society, and was elected a member of its steering committee. Teodor V√¢rgolici, \\"Centenarul SocietƒÉ»õii Scriitorilor Rom√¢ni\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 15/2008 As such, he had a say in the scandal during which the Society, which was Christian-only, moved to reprimand a Jewish Romanian writer, Eugen Porn, and was in turn accused of antisemitism. Bassarabescu took a partisan position, acknowledging that some of Porn's concerns were valid, but concluding that Porn was rather the anti-Romanian.Victor Durnea, \\"Primii pa»ôi ai SocietƒÉ»õii Scriitorilor Rom√¢ni (IV). 'Afacerea Porn' (continuare)\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 5-6/2006, p. 56 A Freemason, he was proposed for membership in the Romanian Academy by Duiliu Zamfirescu and seconded by Maiorescu, themselves Freemasons. He was elected a corresponding member on March 25, 1909. Also in 1909, Socec published another selection of his writings, Noi »ôi vechi (\\"New Ones and Old Ones\\"). Some two years later, Bassarabescu received high appointment in the Education Ministry, as Inspector for the Arts for Minister Constantin C. Arion. In 1912, he was commissioned as Inspector-General for Education. Germanophile and Prefect The onset of World War I marked a turn in Bassarabescu's life. During Romania's neutrality years (1914‚Äì1916), he adapted himself to the Germanophile sentiments of his Junimist and Conservative peers. He gave lectures at the Bucharest Conservative Club, on topics such as Realpolitik and the British Empire. He also joined Junimea geographer Simion Mehedin»õi in putting out Dumineca Poporului review, but contributed his trademark satirical pieces, rather than political articles. Such works were grouped in the 1916 volume Nenea (\\"Old Chap\\"), published with Alcaly. Eventually, Ferdinand I of Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary, the German Empire and the other Central Powers. It came as a shock for the Germanophiles. Although subject to the Romanian Army draft, Bassarabescu managed to avoid being called into active duty, and was instead appointed captain of a military reserve in Mogo»ôoaia train station. Through their personal contacts, both Mehedin»õi and Maiorescu tried to get Bassarabescu appointed to an even safer position, at a postal censorship bureau. In the second half of 1916, the Central Powers broke through Romania's line of defenses, forcing the government and the Army to withdraw northeast, into Moldavia; Bucharest was abandoned. In these circumstances, Bassarabescu checked himself into a Bucharest hospital, claiming that he suffered from a \\"severe cold\\". This allowed him to stay in German-occupied territory, and, in the Romanian loyalist ranks, labeled him a probable deserter.Boia (2010), p. 166 As historian Lucian Boia notes, the suspicion is still standing: an entry in Maiorescu's diary shows that Bassarabescu had left the hospital on at least one occasion during the interval of his supposed illness. In the wake of the Battle of Bucharest, Bassarabescu was held in captivity and processed by the German Army. Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô, a Junimist in the German ranks, intervened for his release, and then employed him at the Bucharest Police Prefecture ‚Äî Bassarabescu served there as Divisional Chief from February to April 1917. The Germans then forced Bassarabescu back to his adoptive Ploie»ôti and to his schoolteacher's career. According to writer Victor Eftimiu, who knew and befriended Bassarabescu, this assignment suited him perfectly: \\"Himself a shy man [like his characters,] he was content with sticking to his provincial schoolteacher's job.\\" A year later, with peace negotiations under way between the Central Powers and Romania, Bassarabescu was reintegrated into the civil service by the emergency cabinet of Alexandru Marghiloman, a Germanophile Conservative. On May 7, 1918, he was made Prefect of Prahova County. He lasted there for a full nine months, earning respect from the populace and defending its interests in disputes with the German occupiers. The Armistice with Germany on the Western Front revolutionized Romania's positioning and brought Marghiloman's administration to a standstill. On the very day of the Armistice, Bassarabescu handed in his resignation. The loyalist regime which took over suspended Bassarabescu from his teaching post, and subjected him to a military inquiry. He was eventually cleared, even praised for his efforts as Prefect, and allowed to resume his work in education.Boia (2010), pp. 166, 359 He also resumed his literary activity, which resulted in the 1919 volume Un dor √Æmplinit (\\"A Satisfied Longing\\", Steinberg Publishers), followed in 1923 by another Socec edition of Nuvele and Mo»ô Stan (\\"Old Man Stan\\", Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ). In 1923, he joined the Writers' Society literary tour of Transylvania, sharing the stage with Eugeniu Botez, Al. T. Stamatiad, Ion Minulescu and others.Mohanu, p. 176 Conservative decline and 1925 return Throughout the war and down to Marghiloman's death, Bassarabescu held on to the presidency of a declining Prahova Conservative chapter. The whole party, now redesigned into a Conservative-Progressive group, was becoming numerically insignificant. According to Bassarabescu's own claim, this was because, in post-war Greater Romania, \\"mediocrity\\", \\"obscurantism\\" and \\"fishing in murky waters\\" had become the standard of political life. Marghiloman, he argued, was a \\"sailor\\" in an age that preferred \\"corsairs\\".Lui Alexandru Marghiloman, omagiu cu prilejul unei √Ændoite aniversari: prietenii »ôi admiratorii lui, pp. 76‚Äì78. Bucharest: Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, 1924 Historian Dorin StƒÉnescu places blame for the party's decline on Bassarabescu himself, noting that his investigation for treason contributed to its dismal results in the election of November 1919.Dorin StƒÉnescu, \\"Prahova\\", in Bogdan Murgescu, Andrei Florin Sora (eds.), Rom√¢nia Mare voteazƒÉ. Alegerile parlamentare din 1919 \\"la firul ierbii\\", p. 336. Ia»ôi: Polirom, 2019. In the mid 1920s, Bassarabescu himself abandoned the Conservative-Progressives, and made a successful return to national politics. He joined the People's Party (PP) of Alexandru Averescu. In exchange, he was made Vice President of the PP section in Prahova and, following the June 1926 election, a Senator for that county. In office only until the 1927 recall, he worked on the short story selections Un om √Æn toatƒÉ firea (\\"A Fully Grown Man\\"), published that year with Socec, and Domnu DincƒÉ (\\"Mister DincƒÉ\\"), which came out, in 1928, at Casa »òcoalelor. Two more small volumes of his works were published in the Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ digest: Spre Slatina (\\"Onwards to Slatina\\"), then Pe drezinƒÉ (\\"On the Draisine\\"). In 1930, the Grand Orient of Romania elected Bassarabescu one of its Masonic Lodge Officers‚Äîdemoted to honorary member in 1933, and affiliated with the regional Libertatea Lodge in 1937. There was also a proposal to make him a full member of the Romanian Academy, where, in 1928, he was giving a formal speech narrating \\"two epochs in Romanian literature\\". According to his own recollections, although he passed one round of voting, he was eventually sidelined and another candidate took the seat (1931). In 1932, the PP split between a conservative group, headed by Averescu, and a radical one, led by Octavian Goga. Bassarabescu sided with the latter, leaving the PP to join Goga's National Agrarian Party (PNA). This was a problematic political move: the PNA was firmly planted on the antisemitic right-wing, albeit its prejudice was mild enough to even allow some Jews into party ranks.Boia (2012), pp. 102‚Äì103, 308 At the time, his more virulently antisemitic colleague, BrƒÉtescu- Voine»ôti, was gathering support for purging the literary world of what he called \\"abject\\" Jewish influences.Boia (2012), pp. 72‚Äì73, 78‚Äì83, 107, 148 Bassarabescu occasionally joined in, such as when he cosigned BrƒÉtescu's letter to novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, an ambiguous document which implied that Sadoveanu had given in to such Jewish influences.Boia (2012), p. 79 Three years later, Bassarabescu followed the National Agrarians into their merger with the National-Christian Defense League, and became a member of the resulting National Christian Party (PNC). This was a more evidently antisemitic organization, unwelcoming of all Jewish PNA members, and publishing open statements against \\"the kikes\\".Boia (2012), pp. 70, 102‚Äì103, 178, 187, 209 As noted by Bassarabescu himself, he was still a PNC member in May 1938, \\"upon the chief's [Goga's] death\\". His literary work at the time was an anthology of Romanian literature, edited in collaboration with Petre Hane»ô (published 1937).CƒÉlinescu, pp. 978, 1007 In 1935, Convorbiri Literare, in the process of recovering unknown writings by the late Maiorescu, also published four letters that Maiorescu had sent to Bassarabescu decades before. Final years Bassarabescu benefited from the rise of an authoritarian single-party regime during the early month of World War II. He made a publicized bid to join the National Renaissance Front, and was accepted into its ranks on Christmas Day, 1939. In 1940, Casa »òcoalelor put out his Opere complete (\\"Complete Works\\"). As a guest of the Romanian Atheneum, Bassarabescu introduced the public to the largely forgotten work of a 19th-century female writer, Sofia Cocea.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1007; Sanda Golopen»õia, \\"Sofia Cocea\\", in Katharina M. Wilson (ed.), An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers, Volume One: A-K, p. 259. London: Routledge, 1991. He was by then a highly decorated member of the establishment: a recipient of the Order of the Crown (commander), the Order of the Star of Romania (officer) and the Cultural Merit Order (officer). His work focused on recollections from an earlier age, such as a 1942 piece about his youthful encounters with Vlahu»õƒÉ, in Gazeta CƒÉr»õilor, a literary newspaper. In 1943, Editura Cugetarea put on sale his definitive collection of ProzƒÉ (\\"Prose\\"), which included some of his memoirs. As Eftimiu notes, they are self-deriding pieces, acknowledging \\"a mediocre destiny\\". The Bassarabescu family fortunes turned during the carpet bombing campaign of 1944. While the Bassarabescus fled for their safety to nearby SlƒÉnic, their Stanian Street lodging was destroyed; they moved to their Dinescu Street residence. Upon war's end, Bassarabescu was also targeted for political retaliation. In 1948, the new communist regime stripped Bassarabescu and 112 others of their Academy membership. PƒÉun Otiman, \\"1948 - Anul imensei jertfe a Academiei Rom√¢ne\\", in Academica, Nr. 4 (31), December 2013, p. 121 The same year, Ecaterina Bassarabescu died, leaving Ioan Alecu to be cared for by daughter Maria-Elisabeta. The latter was a career woman, who had graduated law school and was among the first Romanian female judges. On March 27, 1952, Bassarabescu himself died, the result of a car accident in Ploie»ôti. Although CƒÉlinescu and Eftimiu simply note this is a fact,CƒÉlinescu, p. 581; Eftimiu, p. 466 later sources describe the circumstances of this accident as generally suspicious. In death, Bassarabescu was recoverable. According to Eftimiu, communism allowed Bassarabescu's work to be published \\"in tens of thousands of copies\\", \\"a circulation that they have never had before.\\"Eftimiu, p. 466 The Giurgiu County library in his native city bears his name since 1991. History at the I. A. Bassarabescu County Library site Literary work The chief sources of inspiration behind Bassarabescu's comedic and realistic style were two Junimist figures: the Romanian classic Ion Luca Caragiale, and his own friend, BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 581, 617; Eftimiu, p. 462; Lovinescu, p. 202; Mohanu, p. 214 In their immediate temporal setting, BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti and Bassarabescu were both influential on other noted, non-Junimist, authors of short prose: Emil G√¢rleanu and (for a while) Mihail Sadoveanu.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 617, 631; Eftimiu, p. 462 Beyond this generation, they also influenced the novels or novellas of Lucia Mantu,CƒÉlinescu, p. 779 Marius \\"G. M. VlƒÉdescu\\" Mircu and Cezar Petrescu.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, pp. 330, 351 The eye of such writers is firmly focused on a class of individuals, described for instance in CƒÉlinescu: \\"the isolated folk of provincial boroughs, small-time functionaries of the Romanian Railways, minuscule bourgeois women grinding the great passions of life.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p. 617 Contrary to BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti, he did not depict such men and women as existential losers or \\"misfits\\", but as entirely content with their mediocrity, their \\"terrestrial ideal\\": \\"these people\\", CƒÉlinescu writes, \\"do not suffer, because they do not aim for, or better said they do not foresee, any existence that would be better than theirs.\\" The telegraphist Domi»õian, protagonist of Vulturi, identifies perfection with a hefty state pension; Mister Gu»õƒÉ, of the eponymous story, will only accept the company of women who share his obsession for oleander flowers. As another distinguishing feature, Bassarabescu replaces Caragiale's sarcasm with a \\"lyrical\\", \\"tenderly grotesque\\", layer,CƒÉlinescu, pp. 581‚Äì582 while offering \\"the surprise of a humane bedding\\" within the provincial soul.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 351 His smile, Victor Eftimiu notes, was one \\"of compassion\\", his gaze \\"filtered by tears\\", like that of a Romanian Anton Chekhov.Eftimiu, pp. 462, 464 Literary critic Eugen Lovinescu finds, in most of Bassarabescu's writings, \\"the same family atmosphere with its links of solidarity, with all the hardships of finding their daughters husbands, with sisters that will devour each other out of love, with brothers that will carry on their shoulders the maintenance of their entire household\\". This, Lovinescu believes, was the quintessential \\"Romanian family\\" of the urban milieu, with only a lack of \\"fantasy\\" and failure at pacing preventing Bassarabescu from producing the great Romanian urban novel.Lovinescu, p. 202 (According to Eftimiu, there is in fact an unpublished Bassarabescu novel, as well as a screenplay.)Eftimiu, pp. 462, 466 Bassarabescu's most lyrical pieces may be characterologic studies of sheer timidity, or other debilitating emotions.Eftimiu, pp. 463‚Äì465; Lovinescu, p. 202 In writing Un om √Æn toatƒÉ firea, Bassarabescu shared his own experience as a schoolteacher. He found it impossible to fail a grown man trying to pass his primary school exam, even after discovering that he steals notes from his own daughter.Eftimiu, pp. 465‚Äì465 Elsewhere, a luncheon among family and friends end in collective weeping: people at the table morn their very victim, a long-suffering turkey \\"with a memorable past\\". This \\"tenderly grotesque\\" particularity came through another major influence on Bassarabescu, which distinguishes him among Caragiale's followers: Gustave Flaubert, whose ironic-but-sympathetic accounts of provincial life are at the source of Bassarabescu's \\"Bovaryistic literature\\".CƒÉlinescu, pp. 581, 617, 618 Such a melange, CƒÉlinescu writes, allowed Bassarabescu to cut \\"his own profile, with just a minimal literary activity.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p. 582 In Pe drezinƒÉ, possibly his most Bovaryistic story, the female protagonist dreams of escaping her drab marriage (to an obese station master), for just a taste of life in the capital. Her ideal of what that life is largely shaped by her one-time visit to Bucharest's Gara de Nord. Several of Bassarabescu's sketch story works as recognized as tiny masterpieces of the \\"still-life\\" variety.CƒÉlinescu, p. 582; Lovinescu, pp. 201, 202 This means that they suggest a deep layer of meaning just by describing the assortments of a room, or an object apart, without any actual human presence. AcasƒÉ (\\"Home\\") is a careful inventory of a room seemingly rented by a partying and womanizing officer, including the half- pleading, half-threatening, letter he receives from his desperate supplier of \\"colonial goods\\". According to CƒÉlinescu, such works may even be paralleled to modern art in their studied depiction of \\"urban dreariness\\". For a relevant case, he cites the sketch story fragment: \\"At once, through the beer garden gates, a man showed up carrying with him a giant plank resting on a pole. On this plank, a poster. On the poster, in large handwriting and red paint: 'Gentlemen, today our buffet is serving you vanilla ice cream'.\\" NotesReferences *Lucian Boia, **\\"Germanofilii\\".

In the animist traditions, items as well as humans, animals, plants, and objects are considered to have souls. This festival acknowledged the good given to people by their tools. Practitioners went to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples to thank their broken needles for their help and service.Bates This is in keeping with the philosophy of \\"not wasting\\" or \\"paying honor to the small things\\" exemplified in the concept of mottainai. A ceremony at the Awashima Shrine Modern practice Festival-goers gather at shrines and temples, bringing their broken needles and pins. In a funereal atmosphere, the implements are laid to rest in tofu or konnyaku (soft jelly cakes) in a spirit of tenderness and gratitude.Bates > \\"A small three-step altar is set up and hung with a sacred rope and strips > of cut white paper which indicate a sanctified area.

Bolzern was the founder of early Linux- specific community portals such as LinuxNews, LinuxMall, LinuxPro, LinuxGuru and PenguinPower. Bolzern was also the creator of the original plush Tux mascot, based on the original drawing by Larry Ewing. His work at LinuxMall allowed Bolzern to directly affect the Linux community with LinuxMall's support of various Linux events. His achievements play a significant role in the story of the book Rebel Code by author Glyn Moody  Education & Career  Bolzern graduated in 1976 from West Anchorage High school where, among other things, he first worked with a Monroe 1880 that was programmed via graphite marked cards in Octal and started his fascination with computers. Later Bolzern attended UAA (University of Alaska, Anchorage). During his studies there in the late 1970s, he helped test an early statewide multi-campus e-mail system. After a short year at Cal Poly Pomona (California Polytechnic State University), he transferred to UAF (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) where he studied Electrical Engineering and also played with the Data General Nova computer system used in the development ALOHAnet, where low level error correcting packet protocols CSMA/CD were pioneered, which are now fundamental underlying protocols of TCP/IP, Ethernet, WiFi and the Internet. After being denied access by administrators, Bolzern cracked the University of Alaska statewide computer network in 1978, doing something they didn't think was possible by a standard user. He used the central Honeywell 66 in Fairbanks to send emails to all system users inviting them use his software to participate in an Apple II user group via an early shared account he created, and then set up group communication via mailx (Mail Extended) an enhanced version of the standard Unix command mail. It was these extended features that Bolzern was able to use to create one of the first Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) in history. The Apple access (terminal emulation, etc.) was performed free via software called UACNCAP written and distributed by Bolzern and an associate that made any Apple II with an original model Hayes 300 baud modem into a remote terminal for this GCOS system, later an IBM PC version called PC Communicator (By Bolzern, before PC-Talk) was released as well. GCOS was a very early variant of Unix, and is why the field in Linux where the user's full name goes is called the GCOS field. Bolzern also used this software himself to continue accessing the system from his third-floor Lathrop Hall dorm room, via wires to the one phone for the entire floor, down the hall. Also from anywhere else he happened to be with his Apple II and Hayes Modem, as well as to communicate with his family back home via email, and continued after graduation in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. What Bolzern had created at UAF soon became used by university teachers and students for years thereafter. While at UAF, Bolzern worked at Motorola as an installer and radio technician, and after graduation he took a job with IBM after scoring second highest of anyone else hired that year on the qualification exams. While at IBM he quickly learned how to repair just about any office equipment that IBM had at the time and was influential in recognizing the value of the desktop PC. He ultimately, with IBM management support, resigned IBM and moved to sales of the new machines at ComputerLand, where he sold the first 50 or so PCs delivered within the State of Alaska. General Computer Services, Inc. (GCS) was founded in 1981, and incorporated on September 17, 1982. It was Bolzern‚Äôs consulting company for anything and everything PC-related. He created commercial Job Cost and Estimating software, created an early ISP (Internet Service Provider) for the State of Alaska. It was during this time that he founded the Anchorage PC and Compatibles User group which later became Alaska Computer Society and also ‚ÄúComputer Talk‚Äù the World‚Äôs first (as far as we know) radio talk show about computers. After moving to Aurora, Colorado, Bolzern worked and advised with the Colorado Department of Education, where he built a statewide legislation notification system and helped get computers into the public school system, and then USWest with Unix and Informix SQL database systems for accounting and information management. He also travelled as a speaker on many topics related to computers. It was in the early 1990s that Linux was born and Bolzern soon became one of the more outspoken advocates for development and adoption. WGS (Work Group Solutions) was founded in Aurora, Colorado on June 23, 1993, originally as a subsidiary of GCS. It's big/main achievement was introducing the first commercially-sold software for Linux, Flagship, which was a Clipper compiler for Unix. Then shortly thereafter, LinuxPro. LinuxPro was one of the better known distributions or distros of the early years of Linux. Even winning a Best of Comdex Award (1995) presented by noted science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle. WGS shortly thereafter received a letter stating the company was being sued for using the word Linux, by a mental patient that had trademarked it. Up until then, Linus Torvalds had said he wanted the word Linux to be freely available for anyone. Unfortunately, that could only be achieved by having a non-profit group administer it. Phil Hughes (of Linux Journal), John \\"maddog\\" Hall (Of Digital Equipment Corp), and Bolzern, among others, assembled a group to fight the lawsuit; eventually it was settled by outright giving the trademark directly to Linus Torvalds, with his agreement that LI (Linux International) would manage it. John \\"maddog\\" Hall, and Bolzern made sure that the trademark was put into Linus's name who by agreement made Linux International (LI) the perpetual administrator. What was then Linux International has since morphed into the Linux Foundation. In late 1995 Bolzern founded the Colorado Linux Users and Enthusiasts (CLUE) bringing local high school students in Aurora, CO and businesses who were interested in Linux together with others who used Linux and presented on many topics. Activities included Linux install fests allowing new users to learn more about Linux and the various distros available along with more about the power of open source programs and specifically Linux. In May and June 1998 articles Bolzern wrote were published regarding the Linux Base System project and commenting on the growth of the Linux Community. WGS transitioned into LinuxMall in about 1996, and was by 2000 a firm of 60 employees based in Aurora, Colorado, and the \\"largest online shopping center with software and products for the Linux computer operating system.\\" It was expected to have an initial public offering, but a stock market downturn led, instead, to a reverse acquisition in which it was bought for $25 million by Ebiz Enterprises, an already- publicly listed firm, which was to change its name to LinuxMall.com after the transaction. From April to March 2000, several articles were published by and about Microsoft in relation to Linux with several penned by Bolzern himself, In addition under the PenguinPower name many collectables designed by Bolzern were manufactured by LinuxMall such as this Tux pin being worn by Peter H. Salus. Unfortunately, the growth of LinuxMall was cut short in the early 2000s by the bursting of the tech bubble and non-delivery of a 10 million dollar check the VCs had said was already in the mail, and the subsequent merger activities. Bolzern himself semi-retired to travel with and take care of his wife Virginia who was stricken with cancer. As of February 2012 Mark Bolzern now serves as Chief Technical Officer at Northern Utility Services, LLC in Anchorage, Alaska where he originally grew up. This Autobiographical page also has more details regarding Mark's professional achievements.  Causes and Philosophy  Bolzern‚Äôs involvement in what ultimately became the Linux Foundation was significant. His work includes LI, which Bolzern initially structured as a vendor organization, responsible for the LSB (Linux Standard Base), LPI (Linux Professional Institute) professional Linux certification, and Linux Trademark administration, among other things.  Family  Born in Zurich, Switzerland, the Bolzern Family (Father, Mother, Mark) arrived from Spain via ship along with their VW bus, immigrating via Ellis island just after it permanently closed. Bolzern and his family arrived in Alaska via Florida, Texas, and California, where his brother Ronald was born, and after waiting for the Alaska Highway to open arrived in Anchorage in 1962, just prior to the famous 1964 earthquake. He was naturalized as a U.S. Citizen along with his parents on June 17, 1966 Bolzern spent several years out of the limelight traveling with and caring for his wife Virginia who was dealing with breast cancer until her death on March 8, 2007.

Directed by Stewart Hendler and written by Christopher Yost, the film stars Ben Winchell, Josh Brener, Ana Villafa√±e, Andy Garc√≠a, Maria Bello and Billy Slaughter. Based on the eponymous toy line by Mattel, the film chronicles the adventures of teenaged Max McGrath (Winchell) and alien companion Steel (Brener), who combine their powers to form the superhero Max Steel. Filming began on April 29, 2014, in Wilmington, North Carolina and wrapped in late May 2014. Dolphin Films and Mattel Playground Productions co- produced the film. The film was released in the United States on October 14, 2016, by Open Road Films and was a critical and commercial failure. Plot Teenager Max McGrath moves with his mother to the town of Copper Canyon, where he had been born and where his father had died in a supposed storm. He discovers he has a unique form of tachyonic energy and encounters alien creature Steel, with whom he can symbiotically bond to become the turbocharged superhero Max Steel. Max learns to control and harness his powers and learns the truth about his father's life through flashbacks. Steel, a member of the Ultralink alien species, had worked with Max's father Jim to repel an attack from his fellow Ultralinks on the earth; however, Jim had been betrayed by his partner Miles Edwards and been compelled to sacrifice himself. Max lashes out at Steel when he learns the truth, but is forced to work with Steel again when Edwards entraps Max, seeking to harvest his tachyonic energy for himself. Learning to use his armored form as Max Steel, Max defeats Edwards and finally learns all of his father's story from his mother. The film ends with Max learning to fly in the armor with Steel's assistance. Cast * Ben Winchell as Max McGrath * Maria Bello as Molly McGrath * Ana Villafa√±e as Sofia Martinez * Josh Brener as the voice of Steel * Andy Garc√≠a as Dr. Miles Edwards In addition, Mike Doyle appears briefly as Jim McGrath, father of Max. Production=Development An early attempt to create a Max Steel film occurred in December 2009 when Paramount Pictures purchased the rights to the franchise. Taylor Lautner was an early choice for the starring role, although he later dropped out due to commitment to the Stretch Armstrong film. In January 2013, production was suspended when Max Steel was developed into a television series of the same name, airing later that year. In August 2013, plans for a new film adaptation resumed with Mattel partnering with Dolphin Entertainment to fund the film. In February 2014, Ben Winchell and Ana Villafa√±e were cast as Max McGrath and Sofia Martinez, respectively. That same month, the press officially confirmed Andy Garc√≠a's casting as Dr. Miles Edwards. In May 2014, Maria Bello and Mike Doyle joined the cast as Molly and Jim McGrath, Max's parents. Filming Principal photography commenced on April 29, 2014, in Wilmington, North Carolina, and ended on May 31, 2014. Reception=Box office Max Steel grossed $3.8 million in the United States and Canada and $2.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $6.3 million, against a production budget of $5‚Äì10 million. Max Steel opened on October 14, 2016, alongside The Accountant and Kevin Hart: What Now?, and was expected to gross $5‚Äì7 million from 2,034 theaters in its opening weekend. After grossing just $637,795 on its first day the film went on to open to $2.2 million, finishing 11th at the box office. In its second weekend the film grossed $680,104 finishing 17th at the box office, making it a box office bomb. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rare approval rating of 0% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 2.32/10. The site's critics' consensus states: \\"Bereft of characterization or even satisfying rock 'em sock 'em, Max Steel feels like futzing with an action figure without any childhood imagination.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score 22 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. IGN critic Alex Welch gave the film a score of 4 out of 10, summarizing his review with: \\"Max Steel is one of the more forgettable and pointless attempts at a superhero franchise in the current post-MCU Hollywood market, lacking any of the originality or vibrance that could give it even a remote shot at a successful future.\\" Variety's Joe Leydon gave a negative review, describing it as: \\"A half-baked, time-wasting curtain-raiser for a superhero franchise that is never, ever going to happen.\\" Christy Lemire for RogerEbert.com gave half a star out of 4, writing: \\"For a movie about developing the greatest energy source in the universe, Max Steel is surprisingly bland\\" and that \\"a movie based on a toy should be a whole lot more fun than this.\\" The Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck gave an unfavorable review, writing: \\"Even tweens may find themselves underwhelmed by the new live-action film based on what ‚Äî for many of them ‚Äî may be their favorite Mattel action figure. Delivering a bland cinematic origin story which seems calculated to boost Christmas toy sales, Max Steel is a stillborn, would-be franchise starter, sneaked into multiplexes without advance critic screenings.\\" Home media Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released Max Steel on Digital HD on January 3, 2017, then released the movie on Blu-ray/DVD on January 10, 2017.

Cleveland Cavaliers In September 2010, Griffin was named vice president of basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers. On February 6, 2014, he was named the acting general manager for the Cavaliers, after the firing of Chris Grant from that position.http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on- basketball/24433400/cleveland-cavaliers-protoe-david-griffin-to-interim-gm In his first trade since becoming acting GM, Griffin traded forward Earl Clark, center Henry Sims, and draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for center Spencer Hawes.http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/cavs-acquire-hawes-140220 On May 12, 2014, the Cavaliers announced that Griffin would be named as permanent, full-time general manager. In the following weeks after being named permanent GM, Griffin brought in Euroleague Champion and Coach of the Year David Blatt as head coach, drafted Andrew Wiggins with the number one pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, signed LeBron James back four years after the infamous \\"Decision\\", and acquired All-Star forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a trade. In order to acquire Love, Griffin gave Wiggins and former 1st overall pick Anthony Bennett to the Wolves. As a result of these moves and many others, Griffin placed second in the NBA Executive of the Year Award voting for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Griffin and the Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA Finals after defeating the 73-win Golden State Warriors in seven games, becoming the first team in league history to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. Griffin's Cavaliers set offensive records in the 2017 playoffs, setting a playoff scoring efficiency record by scoring 120 points per 100 possessions, but ultimately lost in five games in the 2017 Finals to a revamped Warriors team that added Kevin Durant to their 73-win core. On June 19, 2017, both Griffin and Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert announced that they would not renew their contract together after no agreement between the two sides could be reached. His position would ultimately be replaced by the Cavaliers' assistant general manager, Koby Altman, over a month later on July 24. Gilbert was widely criticized for failing to come to terms on a new contract with Griffin.http://www.cleveland.com/livingston/index.ssf/2017/06/dan_gilberts_biggest_mistake_s.htmlhttps://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/20/15835070/david- griffin-dan-gilbert-history-cavs- gmhttp://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/presents-19685160/nba-end-david- griffin-tenure-cleveland For a Sports illustrated article released Thursday August 1, 2019, David Griffin expressed in detail his experience working with and building a supporting cast of team members around LeBron James.

It was acquired by the German-based SARIA Group and the name was changed to SARIA in 2014. The company provided services to the agricultural and food sectors (recycling waste from meat and food industries), as a producer of green forms of energy, and as a manufacturer of products for human consumption, pet food, aquaculture, oleochemistry and agriculture. History Prosper De Mulder was founded in 1926 in Doncaster by the De Mulder family and Prosper joined aged 16. It now employs over 1000 staff at 23 sites across the United Kingdom. Prosper De Mulder remained as Chairman until his death and was actively involved with the company until his late 80's. Away from work Mr De Mulder was active within the local Freemasons and was interested in sailing and flying. PDM Group increased its market share in the rendering (animals) industry in Britain; between 1968 and 1975, PDM acquired 79 U.K. rendering facilities, either closing, or absorbing them. PDM Group has expanded its range of food waste recycling services and has developed a business investing in Anaerobic Digestion (AD) operation to the UK. ReFood UK is reported to combine SARIA's expertise in operating AD plants with \\"PDM's UK food waste recycling capabilities\\". There are plans for a network of AD plants in the UK and use the by-product as a fertilizer Sale of shares and name change In 2010, German-based SARIA Group acquired a 10% interest in the group, increasing that to a controlling 51% a year later with the De Mulder family retaining the remaining shares. The company changed its name to 'SARIA' in 2014 and in February 2016, the De Mulder family sold their remaining shares to the SARIA Group. Competition Commission investigation PDM Group have been the subject of a Competition Commission investigation over a number of years. Following a 1993 Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) report into the supply of animal waste in England and Wales and in Scotland, PDM Group were required to give undertakings to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. These undertakings related to the manner in which PDM had conducted its business with trading practices that had been found by the MMC to operate against the public interest. The principal issue identified in the MMC's report, in respect of PDM's trading practices, related to discriminatory pricing, and in particular the finding that there practices had harmed smaller competitors and restricted competition. In addition, the MMC found that PDM's financial reporting were \\"not suitably transparent and gave a distorted account of the true profitability of its rendering business\\". PDM had was also found to have breached earlier undertakings relating to its gut-room business and to acquisitions, which had led to a restriction of competition. Investigations regarding products not intended for human consumption Rotherham council's environmental health department began an investigation in 1995 after it received a letter from an anonymous local butcher that Wells By Products, a PDM subsidiary, was illegally selling poultry not intended for human consumption. Police subsequently discovered a nationwide distribution network, using unmarked lorries, false names and paperwork to sell meat, heavily disguised to look white, which moved through a series of middlemen on to supermarkets. The investigation concluded that five meat traders had set up a secret boning shed operation at Wells By-Products‚Äô factory at Darlton, near Newark. There, green bits of flesh, mould and feathers were removed from pet food grade meat. The meat was then hosed down and left to steep in salt baths. It was then packed and labelled as fit for humans. The scam had gone on for three years. During the subsequent trial, which lasted for seventy days, the court heard that the conspirators had made profits of ¬£2.5 million. On 22 December 2000, five men were jailed for a combined 24 years for supplying 1,300tons of potentially lethal condemned poultry for human consumption. Andrew Boid the former manager of the Wells By-Products factory was jailed for eight years: seven years for conspiracy and one year for fraud. Doncaster based Nortech Foods, part of the PDM Group was investigated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2005. The investigation was launched after beef dripping made from fat not intended for human consumption was found to be on sale. The FSA investigation in conjunction with the local authorities centred on how the product entered the food chain and the extent of the problem. The FSA said that the batch of dripping was highly unlikely to pose any risk to health because of the high temperature at which it was processed. The fat was derived from carcasses that had been through the normal hygiene and BSE controls. Nortech Foods disposed of all its remaining stock and carried out a trade withdrawal to recover from its customers any remaining dripping. Fine for environmental offences John Knight (Animal By Products) Ltd., based in Silvertown, London, was fined for the third time in three years in October 2012 at Thames Magistrate's Court. Newham Council received around 300 formal complaints during 2011 from local residents concerning smells emanating from the factory. The fine of ¬£120,000 plus ¬£66,150 costs is believed to be the largest fine ever obtained by a local authority for an offense of this nature under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The company was found guilty of nine counts of failing to properly prevent emissions of offensive odours beyond the factory boundary in breach of its regulatory Environmental Permit. The company were previously fined ¬£75,000 with ¬£75,000 costs in 2011 due to odours emitted from the factory and ¬£10,000 with ¬£10,500 costs in 2009 when a pile of meal was left outside rotting.

Role in spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy PDM Group grew through the 1960s to 1990s at which time it reportedly controlled 70% of Britain's meat rendering industry. PDM Group was linked with the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Numerous commentators have investigated a link between PDM and the outbreak of BSE and CJD. Those linking PDM Group to BSE included David Hichclifffe, Member of Parliament for Wakefield. In early day motion 1006 (Session 1995‚Äì1996), which was tabled on 17 June 1996, he said ‚Äú..Prosper De Mulder, the rendering company whose products are believed to have been a major source of BSE in cattle..‚Äù. The purpose of this early day motion was however to highlight a joint Observer World In Action investigation into the relationship between John Whitfield, MP for Dewsbury from 1983 to 1987 and PDM. During this time it was reported Mr Whifield had acted as PDM's solicitor and arranged meetings on their behalf to lobby Government Ministers not to abandon the use of meat and bone products in animal feeds. It also highlighted a donation of ¬£10,000 that PDM had made to the Dewsbury Conservative Association in 1992 at a time when Mr Whitfield was seeking re- election. In 2001, an employee of PDM Group, conceded it was \\"quite possible\\" that products manufactured by PDM (Prosper De Mulder) was ultimately responsible for cases of BSE worldwide.

He was active mainly in a Mannerist style, working for the courts of Grandukes Francesco I and Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Biography Pieroni was also known as the Sandrino dall‚Äô Impruneta. He was born in Florence in 1550 where he graduated from the Accademia del Disegno in 1570. He began his career as an assistant to Alessandro Allori. Allori led the team between 1587 and 1591, including Pieroni, Giovanni Bizelli, Giovanni Maria Butteri, and a young Cigoli in decorating the ceilings of the corridors of the Uffizi in Florence. For the chapel of San Giovan Gualberto in the Abbey of San Michele in Passignano, Pieroni painted an altarpiece of San Giovan Gualberto pardons the murderers of his brother before the crucifix of San Miniato. For the visit of Grand-Duke Ferdinand to Pisa in 1588, Pieroni completed, along with the painter Filippo Paladino, a canvas for the church of the Santo Stefano dei Cavalieri, depicting scenes from the life of Santo Stefano Martire. He also helped design the facade. Giorgio Vasari likely also participated in the design of the ceiling decorations. He painted an altarpiece for the Principi Chapel in the church of San Lorenzo. An artist in the court was commissioned works to celebrate the weddings of the Medici. In 1589, he was among the artists engaged in the elaborate decorations to celebrate the marriage of Ferdinando I and Cristina di Lorraine, painting the Defeat of Gian Galeazzo Visconti at Mantua. With Bernardo Buontalenti, he also made scenography for the Theater at the Uffizi, for the 1600 presentation of the comedy La Pellegrina and also made decorations to celebrate the wedding of Marie de' Medici to Henry IV of France. As an architect, he worked with Bernardo Buontalenti in the design of fortifications of the Belvedere in Florence and the Corsini Chapel in church of the Carmine, and the facade of Santa Maria del Fiore. In Volterra, he helped design the Chapel of St Paul for the Admiral Jacopo Inghirami (and paint the main altarpiece). Many of his architectural skills were focused on Livorno. When confronted by the Grand Duke about the size of the Cathedral of Livorno (built 1594-1606), he replied that public works can never be too large. He also helped design the church of the Madonna (begun in 1607), the church of the Greci Uniti (1606), and the Synagogue of Livorno (1603). He helped design porticos for the Piazza d'Armi.

It was established by the O'Conors in the early 14th century, but nothing remains of the original structures. Geography Dough Castle is located in the townland of Dough in the civil parish of Kilmacrehy, County Clare. It lies to the south of the combined estuary of the Inagh and Dealagh rivers. History The castle was originally established by the O‚ÄôConnors, then lords of Corcomroe, in 1306. It served as their principal stronghold and was sited at the strategically important mouth of the Inagh River, where it could control both land and water traffic. A castle here is mentioned in 1422, but all the structures that survive today are of later origin. In 1471, the chieftain was murdered in the castle by his nephews and was buried at the end of what is now the main street of Lahinch. A cairn was erected in his memory, and this gave rise to the official Irish name for Lahinch, Leacht Ui Chonchuir, or \\"O'Connor‚Äôs Cairn\\". In 1584 it was held by the family of Sir Donal O'Brien. one of whom, Daniel, gave \\"hospitable and humane\\" shelter to English settlers who were threatened by the Irish rebellion of 1641. In return for his actions, Dough castle was spared from being demolished or slighted by the Cromwellian army. In 1654, Cromwellian officer Colonel Stubber saved the castle from demolition, and in 1675 the castle still had the full tower with a two-storey house (it was described as a tall battlemented tower with a large two-storey dwelling house attached to one side). Large windows with flat arches and slab lintels replaced the older slit windows. The present ruin is the result of various collapses due to the castle having been built upon sandbanks. One side had fallen before 1839, and a considerable mass, with the chimney, fell in 1883. These sandbanks were reported to be the home of Donn Dumhach (Donn of the sandhills), a s√≠ prince who according to tradition still haunts the scene. The sandhill near the bridge is also reported to be haunted. No trace has been found of a supposed underground passage, filled with valuables, leading from the castle to Liscannor. Today Due to poor foundations on sand, the castle collapsed several times and today it is in ruins, with little more than part of the O'Brien tower remaining on Lahinch Golf Course near where the Dealagh joins the Inagh River. There was another castle in the vicinity, O'Brien's Castle, built by Turlough O'Brien of the O'Brien clan in 1588 to defend against the Spanish, but nothing remains of this fortress.

He was executed on October 6, 1927. His case was very famous, with even several articles appearing in newspapers that glorified his actions.  Biography  Leci√°n was born on October 31, 1900 in Uhersk√Ω Ostroh, and was brought up in a youth detention center. Immediately after his release, he began to commit crimes and was twice punished by the Regional Court of Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ. During his military service, he fled five times. After his last defecation, he met Maria Krenovska and together they started stealing treasures all over Moravia. They opened the door by pulling out the 4 to 5 mm thick coffin cloak to destroy the locking mechanism, and then opened the cash register without having to inhale any ashes. He used this method as he was suffering from tuberculosis. In Prostƒõjov, however, both Leci√°n and Krenovska were detained and transferred to a hospital in Olomouc. From there on December 10, 1926, Martin escaped with a dangerous criminal named Szekely, injuring two guards on the way. They then committed a series of thefts, but on December 21 they split up in Buƒçovice, with Leci√°n staying in Moravia while Szekely left for Slovakia. Both of them were announced as sought after criminals by the District Chief of Staff in Vyskov. On January 19, 1927, Leci√°n committed his first murder in Slavkov u Brna, killing municipal police officer Rudolf Han√°k with four shots from his weapon, as the officer had attempted to interrupt his burglary. The next day he attempted to kill the shop owner and a police officer in Poled≈à√°k. A month later he murdered guard Franti≈°ek Marƒç√≠k at the Grafony in Jihlava. In mid- February, Leci√°n was identified by a Jihlava gendarme on a train. Leci√°n shot him several times, and eventually jumped out of the moving train. A search was announced for him with a reward of 10,000 korunas for his capture. Despite this, Leci√°n began to wear a mask and continued his criminal activities. The public celebrated his courage, and songs were written about him, presenting him as a gallant cassarer who robbed the rich. His popularity ended on March 8, when he shot twice in Vesel√≠ nad Moravou at Chancellor Anton√≠n Stuchlƒ±, who was expecting a child shortly after his wedding. Leci√°n then shot down military chief Chvalovsky shortly afterwards. Subsequently, armed soldiers and gendarme engaged the murderer in several shootings. At one of them, near Pole≈°ovice, Leci√°n was injured, but still managed to escape the police. Only on April 23 was he detained in Nov√Ω Bohum√≠n by civil police officers Hal√≠≈ô and Kalu≈æa. A four-month investigation followed, followed up by a six-day trial. On September 31, 1927, Leci√°n was sentenced to death for his crimes. However, on September 25, along with the deserter Ka≈°parik, he tried to escape. They were forced to seize the weapon and kill the guard Ferenc Kisse, but were eventually recaptured after a brief shootout. As a result, he was denied a pardon from the President of the Republic. Martin Leci√°n was executed at the courtyard of the Olomouc military prison on October 6, 1927 at 6:00.http://jinova.cz/kasar-lecian-martin  Successors  Six years after Leci√°n's execution, Franti≈°ek Ondr√°≈° tried to overcome him. He described himself as his \\"heir\\", and he claimed that he would be worse than Leci√°n was in his life. Ondr√°≈° managed to kill two gendarmes, but he himself was killed from fear by his two companions, the Gerspitzer brothers. Both were sentenced to death. After several years, the other person who tried to imitate Leci√°n was Jozef Prekop, a cousin of his, from ƒåerven√Ω Kame≈à near P√∫chov. However, he was soon injured in a shootout and arrested in the Vinohrady hospital, where he asked for treatment.  References  Literature  * JEDLIƒåKA, Miloslav.

Upper Alsace (southern Alsace) was a landgraviate of the Holy Roman Empire centred on Ensisheim and Landser, north of the County of Ferrette (Pfirt). The counts of Habsburg ruled the territory from the 1130s down to its cession to France in the 17th century. Albert III, Count of Habsburg, received the landgraviate of Upper Alsace from the Emperor Frederick I in 1186. Frederick's son, Duke Frederick V, was his lord with the title of Duke of Alsace (Elisatiae dux). On 9 May 1469, Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy acquired the landgraviate of Upper Alsace and the county of Ferrette for 50,000 Rhenish florins. At the time of its purchase, the landgraviate was heavily mortgaged and pawned. Landser was mortgaged to Th√ºring von Hallwill for 7,000 florins. On 20 September Charles appointed Peter von Hagenbach as the \\"grand bailiff (Landvogt) of Ferrette and Alsace\\" with his seat at Ensisheim. This official was a successor of the previous Austrian-appointed Landvogt, and thus in the service of the landgrave of Upper Alsace. The Landvogtei (bailiwick) of Alsace itself was an imperial office then mortgaged to the Electoral Palatinate. On 14 April 1646, the imperial ambassador Trauttmansdorff, during negotiations to end the Thirty Years' War, offered \\"Upper and Lower Alsace and the Sundgau, under the title of Landgraviate of Alsace\\" to the French. There was no such territory, since Alsace was at the time divided into several jurisdictions held by competing powers. The Archduke Ferdinand Charles held the landgraviate of Upper Alsace, while a relative held the Landvogtei (bailiwick) of Hagenau with a protectorate over the D√©capole (a league of ten imperial cities).

Zhengyi Taoism and Faism are often grouped together under the category of \\"daoshi and fashi ritual traditions\\" (). Although the two types of priests have the same roles in Chinese society‚Äîin that they can marry and they perform rituals for communities' temples or private homes‚ÄîZhengyi daoshi emphasize their Taoist tradition, distinguished from the vernacular tradition of the fashi.Edward L.

(although historically they were excluded from performing the jiao liturgy). The only ones that are shamans (wu) are the fashi of the Lushan school. The fashi Taijitu symbols are used also in ritual masters' traditions. The ritual masters ( fashi) are defined, in opposition to formally ordained Taoist priests, as:Kohn, 2009. p. 9 ::¬´Lay practitioners beyond formal organisations whose lineages are vocational rather than hereditary. They live in the communities or among the families they serve or travel through villages and towns of the country, performing exorcisms, establishing protection, and effecting cures among the populace.¬ª Sarah Coakley (Cambridge University) distinguishes fashi as \\"kataphatic\\" (of filling character) in opposition to Taoists as \\"kenotic\\" (of emptying character), and links them to other Sino-Tibetan indigenous religions:Sarah Coakley.

Cambridge University Press, 2000. . p. 246 ::¬´resemble or make use of Taoist texts and visualisation, but are not truly Taoist; i.e., they are not kenotic or emptying in character, but rather kataphatic or filling with lesser spirits and local phenomena of nature. Though scholars and official Chinese sources often catalogue these practices as \\"Taoist\\", because they use Taoist texts, symbols and icons, in fact they are called by different names [...] Such practice can (but does not always) include what is called \\"redhead\\" or \\"redhat\\" (hung-tou) Taoism, the rituals of Yao, Miao, Na-hsi, Moso and Bon Tibetan practices, and the Ngapa or Ngawa rites of Tibetan conjurers in parts of Amdo [...] Though the mantra incantations and mudra hand symbols used by Taoist and popular religious experts are often similar if not identical, the goal and physical effect on the body are different. The Taoist sense of emptying kenosis and peace distinguish the traditional meditative system from the popular rites that summon violent spirits, exorcise evil demons, and attempt to control the elements such as wind, rain, hail, snow, and other forces of nature. Apophasis or \\"emptying\\" distinguishes the truly Taoist practice from the kataphatic or \\"filling\\" rites of the medium, shaman, oracle and popular priest.¬ª They are known by different names throughout China, other popular ones being \\"ritual officers\\" (faguan) as they at times call themselves,Nadeau, 2012. p. 140 or \\"redhead\\" Taoist priests ( hongtou daoshi). There are also localised names, such as \\"orthodox lords\\" (duangong), \\"altar masters\\" (zhangtanshi), or \\"earth masters\\" (tulaoshi) in Guizhou.Van der Meij, 1997. p. 478 They are also in competition with other orders who perform similar services: monks and tantric masters under the auspices of Buddhism, and tongji media. The difference between ritual masters and gods' media is that instead of being subject to territorial gods like the media, the ritual masters can marshal the powers of local gods. Red Taoist orders The Waterside Dame and her two attendants Lin Jiuniang and Li Sanniang, at the Temple of Heavenly Harmony of the Lushan school in Luodong, Yilan, Taiwan.

It is also related to the cult of Wang Laomu, and competing with Maoshan Taoism. The tradition shows similarities with Yao and Zhuang ritual traditions, and has incorporated elements of Tantra, such as the use of mudra and vajra. Lushan fashi perform rituals as the head of celestial troops while invoking the \\"Three Ladies\\" (sannai): Chen Jinggu and her two disciples, Lin Jiuniang and Li Sanniang. Although Lushan fashi are men, in performance they wear the ritual red skirt of Chen Jinggu and a crown or headdress with the words \\"Three Ladies\\" painted on it.

Dohmen (1904-1977) was a well-known and highly accomplished German liturgical artist who immigrated to the United States with his family after the Second World War. In pre-World War II Germany had won numerous competitions for large frescoes, up to 10 stories high, and art works for public buildings. When he refused several times invitation to become a member of the Nazi party, which recruited accomplished people, he was put on the \\"black list\\" and no longer qualified for governmental contracts. Right after the war, he decided to leave Germany for the USA, saying that Europe will always be at war. He and the family were on one of the first trains from Cologne to Hamburg, to the American Embassy to apply for immigration of the family. The visas were finally granted after a 5 year wait. And thus the second successful episode of his life, being one of the world's great ecclesiastical artists, started. Education and early career Dohmen was born on May 28, 1904 near Cologne, Germany. At an early age, he showed his talent for art. As a young student he painted some beautiful, religious oil paintings with traditional religious themes. He was eager to learn more from the best art professors of Europe and applied for scholarships to some of the leading art academies. His efforts paid off when he received a scholarship from the German government. He then attended some of the most prominent art academies of Europe, including: Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, Aachen, and the Higher Institute of the Royal Art Academy in Antwerp, Belgium. He studied under some of the most noteworthy and prominent professors of art at the time, such as Professor Johan Thorn Prikker, Dominikus Boehm, and the Baron Professor Isidore Obsomer, Director of the Royal Art Academy in Antwerp. After completing his studies, Dohmen served briefly as an art professor at the Institute for Christian Art in Dortmund before becoming the manager of a highly regarded art studio in Austria, where he worked in fresco murals, mosaic murals, and stained glass windows. In 1936 he returned to Germany to establish his own art studio in Cologne. Peter Dohmen Studios in Germany Dohmen became well known as an artist in Germany during the 1930s for his monumental art works, including stained glass windows, large frescoes on major public buildings, and Byzantine glass mosaics. In 1937 he made an exciting, historic discovery in the dome of an ancient church in Cologne, Germany, the Ursula Kirche: he found that underneath the paint of the vaulted ceilings were beautiful religious paintings dating back to the 13th century. The Minister of Culture commissioned him to restore and save the very valuable frescoes. Later, the government also commissioned him with the execution of historic fresco murals (3000 sq. ft.) in the Knights Hall of a medieval citadel in Juelich, Germany. In 1938 he was offered a professorship at the State Art Academy in Koenigsberg, Germany. However, a few weeks before taking this position, a law was passed requiring that those teaching at a state school had to be members of the Nazi party. Given his dislike of the Nazis, he declined. He wanted to leave Germany, but the government had already made it difficult to leave. Finally, the exits slammed shut and no German could leave the country. During the war, the Dohmen family lost their homes twice from Allied bombs. They and most Germans lived in their basements for months to be protected from the constant bombings, at night by the English, during the day by Americans. They had to flee several times with just the clothes to could carry in backpacks, to escape the battle front and once to escape the Nazis. He had helped four of his school friends, who were Jewish to escape across the border out of Germany. Eventually he was blackballed by the government because of his outspoken opposition toward the Nazi party. His studio in Cologne was destroyed by bombing during World War II. He decided that once the war was over, he would leave Germany and go to \\"America, the land of the Free.\\" After the war, as soon as the railroad started running again, he and the family took the train to the American Embassy in Hamburg to apply for an immigration visa. It took five years, and when the visa was granted, the family sold their house and furniture, and immigrated to the United States. German monetary restrictions allowed the family to only take the equivalence of $10 per person out of the country. And thus, the Dohmen family arrived with $40 in the US. A relative in ST. Paul had sponsored the family. They arrived in ST. Paul during one of the harshest winters in years. After turning down several offers from leading stained glass studios in the US to become an employee, he established the Peter Dohmen Studios in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His more modern art style was just what young architects were looking for and had not been able to find. These architects did not want the very traditional church art, often referred to as \\"kitch.\\" His timing had been perfect and soon he started receiving contracts for some very prominent institutions. Peter Dohmen Studios in St. Paul, MN Amongst some of his major works are the mosaic murals at Carleton College in Minnesota, stained glass windows in the library of the University of Notre Dame, and the windows in the Chapel of the Resurrection at Valparaiso University, Indiana. Dohmen married the daughter of a well-known businessman in Cologne. They had two sons just before World War II broke out. In the 1950s he and his wife designed the stained glass windows in the United States and then the window were fabricated in some of the most reputable fabrication studios in Germany, using only the highest grade glass and materials, such as mouthblown antic glass. This glass gives the windows a crystal like character. The windows were then shipped in sections to the US for installation. Peter Dohmen‚Äôs works can be found in numerous churches in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, North- and South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin. He also did the breathtaking Byzantine glass mosaic columns in the Veterans Administration building in St. Paul, Minnesota introducing art which had been used for thousands of years, and can be seen at the Vatican, St. Mark‚Äôs Basilica in Venice, and most of the extraordinary buildings of old Europe. Other Minnesota locations of Dohmen's stained glass art are Messiah Episcopal Church in Saint Paul, Pilgrim Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, and Richfield United Methodist Church. He was often invited to display his works of art in many art exhibitions in Europe as well as in the U. S. He retired from the business in 1972 and died in May 1977 in Koenigswinter, Germany. He left behind some of the most extraordinary works of arts for others to enjoy. In 1961 Dieterich Spahn worked as his apprentice, and assisted in the production of two of the Valparaiso windows. In 1971, after Peter Dohmen decided to retire, Spahn and New York artist Mel Geary bought the Peter Dohmen Studio. Dieterich Spahn has carried on in the great tradition and has designed many outstanding stained glass windows in his own style over the past 40 years. His studio is in Minnetonka, MN. The Chapel of the Resurrection at Valparaiso University Dohmen completed four large stained glass windows in the Chapel of the Resurrection, three chancel windows and a lone window in the western wall of the chapel. The three chancel windows constituted the largest stained glass commission in the United States at the time of their installation, each measuring 85-feet-tall by 22-feet-wide. They are known as the Munderloh windows, after the donors, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred C. Munderloh of Detroit, Michigan. The window in the western wall was given by Mr. and Mrs. Richard E. Meier and is known as the Meier window. The Chapel of the Resurrection project was completed in phases spanning over a half-decade. The Meier window was dedicated on the same day as the chapel itself, September 27, 1959. The center Munderloh window was dedicated on February 5, 1961. The two flanking Munderloh windows were finally dedicated several years later, on January 10, 1965. Mr. Dohmen worked closely with Dr. A. R. Kretzmann, the liturgical consultant of the Chapel of the Resurrection to create windows that have since been referred to as ‚Äúsermons in color.\\" =The Munderloh Redemption Window= The center window, the Redemption Window, tells the stories of the New Testament. The first division of this window features the rising sun of a new day in Christ. A Messianic Rose, along with symbols of the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Stem of Jesse, all come together to describe the prophetic fulfillment that is Jesus Christ ‚Äì the word made flesh. The divisions that follow this depict the well-known stories of the New Testament, including Christmas, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter. The final divisions of the center window look forward to Christ‚Äôs return to creation. The book with seven seals along with trumpets sounding to the Four Corners of the earth are displayed here. This window is concluded with the Chi-Rho, a symbol for Christ and his eternal presence. Some text also appears interspersed with the images of the Redemption Window. In the center of the window, the mark ‚ÄúIC-XC-NIKA‚Äù appears. This early text, which translates to ‚ÄúJesus Christ, the Conqueror‚Äù comes from an Ephesian tomb from the third century, AD. Also appearing in the center of this window is the Latin ‚ÄúIn Luce Tua, Videmus Lucem.‚Äù This text from the 36th Psalm is also the motto for Valparaiso University. =The Munderloh Creation Window= The window on the far right is the Creation Window. Like each of the Munderloh windows, this window is read clockwise, starting in the upper-right corner and continuing through each of the ten divisions of the window. The first division bears the marks of the planets, followed by the creating hands of God in the second division. The next divisions feature well-known Old Testament stories, from Adam and Eve, to the Ten Commandments and symbols of the ancient kings. This first window concludes with images of peace, most specifically with a dove, which soars more than 80 feet above the chancel. =The Munderloh Sanctification Window= The third Munderloh Window is the Sanctification Window. The initial divisions of this window show symbols of the early church: scrolls (the Holy Scripture) and a dove (Pentecost) are among these symbols. The next division includes images of Christian martyrdom and moves into images of contemporary Christian life. Music, nations, scientific advances and world mission all appear in the images of this window. The elements of the Eucharist along with other symbols of priestly office also are present here. This final window concludes with Luther‚Äôs coat of arms and the torch of this university. Both of these symbols are excellent symbols of Valparaiso University ‚Äì a university under the cross, whose flame of faith continually lights the lamp of learning. =The Meier Window= The Meier Window is designed to present ‚Äúmusic and its place in the life of the Christian.‚Äù The art of this window depicts both the light-hearted and austere nature of art, specifically music, in a Christian life. Many instruments also find their way into the window, the entire work set against, ‚Äúa striking red motif, the symbol of Christ‚Äôs saving redemption and of our personal salvation.‚Äù The Meier Window contains 3,400 pieces of stained glass.

He served in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession and court-martialled after the Fontenoy in May 1745, allegedly for failing to carry out his orders. Ingoldsby felt he was taking the blame for mistakes made by the 24 year old Duke of Cumberland and the evidence supported his claim to have received inconsistent orders. However, his contemporaries considered this an inadequate excuse; the court concluded his failure arose 'from an error of judgement, and not from want of courage' but he was forced out of the army. Life He was the son of Richard Ingoldsby (1654‚Äì1703) of Waldridge, Buckinghamshire, and his wife Mary Colmore. The family owned lands in Buckinghamshire and Ireland; his grandfather and namesake, Sir Richard Ingoldsby (1617-1685), signed the death warrant for Charles I but retained his title and lands under Charles II. Career His father's cousin, yet another Richard Ingoldsby (1665-1712), served with Marlborough during the War of the Spanish Succession and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ireland in 1707. In April 1707, the younger Ingoldsby was commissioned into his regiment, the 18th Foot, later Royal Irish, and served with it in Flanders. The 18th fought at Oudenarde and Malplaquet until the war ended in 1713, by which time Ingoldsby was a captain. During the 1715 Jacobite Rising, he transferred to the Foot Guards; this provided personal protection to George I and its officers considered loyal to the new regime. Britain was largely at peace for the next 25 years and it was not until November 1739 that Ingoldsby received his next promotion. After the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, the Duke of Cumberland was made colonel of the regiment; it was posted to Flanders and Ingoldsby appointed a brigadier of foot. In March 1745, Cumberland replaced George Wade as Allied commander in Flanders, where his opponent was Maurice de Saxe, one of the most talented generals of the period. Battle of Fontenoy The French line (blue), running from St Antoine (bottom right), the Redoubt d'Eu just before the Bois de Barry (top left) A reconnaissance carried out by Cumberland and his senior officers on 9 May identified the Redoubt de Chambonas but not the Redoubt d'Eu, the strongest position on the French left. The next day was spent clearing French positions at Vezin (see Map) but a suggestion they should do the same for the Bois de Barry was ignored. Delays in deploying the Allied forces meant the attack was postponed until 11 May, both armies camping overnight on their positions. Cumberland ordered Ingoldsby to capture the Redoubt de Chambonas and clear the woods, while the Dutch attacked Fontenoy. Once both flanks were engaged, massed Allied infantry in the centre would move up the slope and dislodge the main French army. Shortly before 6:00 am, Ingoldsby began his attack, bringing him into contact with the previously undetected Redoubt d'Eu. His troops also came under fire from French skirmishers in the Bois de Barry, mixed cavalry and infantry troops known as Harquebusiers de Grassins. These numbered no more than 900 but uncertain of their strength, Ingoldsby requested artillery and cavalry support; given the earlier failure to detect the redoubt, his caution was understandable but delayed the main attack. Impatient with the lack of progress, Cumberland ordered Ingoldsby to ignore the redoubt and advance with the main column, but did not inform Ligonier of this change. Two Dutch assaults on the village of Fontenoy failed; the main attack did not take place until 12:30 and went ahead without securing either of the flanks. Ingoldsby was wounded, while two regiments of his brigade suffered the largest casualties of any units involved in the attack on the French centre. The Allies were rescued by the tenacity and discipline of their infantry but Fontenoy ended the myth of British military superiority held in Europe since Marlborough. In the recriminations that followed, Ingoldsby was court- martialled for failing to attack the Redoubt d'Eu, although his claim to have received inconsistent orders was supported by the evidence. The court concluded his failure arose 'from an error of judgement, and not from want of courage' but he was forced out of the army. Cumberland gave him three months to sell his commission and retire, but in the general panic that accompanied the Jacobite Rising, George II refused to allow him to sell his majority in the Guards. It was given to Colonel John Laforey in November, Ingoldsby incurring a large financial loss as a result. He died at home in Lower Grosvenor Street, London on 16 December 1759, and buried at the family seat, Hartwell, Buckinghamshire, along with his widow Catherine, who died 28 January 1789.

The front cockpit is covered by a one piece plexiglas canopy which opens to the right and the rear cockpit is covered by a canopy incorporating the inner leading edges of the wing, opening rear-wards, held in place by the front canopy when closed.

Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, at 38% chord and approx ‚Öì span, open out above and below the wing to provide approach control. Performance of the Ka-2 was found to be lower than expected, due to the relatively high wing loading. Schleicher introduced the Ka2b, increasing the wingspan from to , to improve the efficiency of the wing. Fuselage length was also increased by to to maintain stability margins in pitch. Performance of the Ka-2b was improved in weak thermals due to a lower minimum sink speed, allowing tighter thermalling. Cross-country performance was also improved by a higher glide ratio, increasing the chance of reaching the next thermal.

The Arkansas-Mississippi border follows the center of the narrow, curving lake. Prior to 1938, the north-south flowing Mississippi River curved east into Mississippi, flowed along Lake Whittington (then called \\"Bolivar Bend\\"), and then continued its north-south route. History The town of Bolivar, Mississippi, located on the east shore of Bolivar Bend, was protected by a small levee prior to the Civil War. In 1863, the Union gunboat cut the levee, causing significant flooding to the town and surrounding area. Island No. 76 was located in Bolivar Bend, just north of Bolivar. During the Civil War, the island was used by the Union Army as a woodyard, and a group of freed slaves lived there, cutting and stacking wood. In 1865, the Union transport ship James Watson ran aground on the island and caught fire, killing 24. The island is now called \\"Goat Island\\". In 1933, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began construction of 13 cutoffs along the lower Mississippi River. Previous cutoffs had been constructed along the river, and were of commercial benefit because they allowed ships to bypass lengthy U-shaped bends. Typically, cutoffs were created by digging a channel across a peninsula, leaving the bypassed bend to form an oxbow lake. Lake Whittington was created when the \\"Caulk Neck Cutoff\\" was constructed across \\"Caulk Island\\" peninsula in 1937‚Äì1938. Communities There was once year- round high-water public access to Lake Whittington at Neblett's Landing, just north of Bolivar, Mississippi, the only community located on the lake, but that ramp has now been purchased by a private hunting club and is closed to the public. Public access is still possible through two chutes to the Mississippi River, accessible only when the river is at three to six feet on the Arkansas City gauge, and from Little Man's Landing, which is only open during the summer months depending on water level. Cottages and hunting lodges dot the Mississippi side of the lake. A private airport with a grass surface, Catfish Point Airport, is located at the south end of the lake. Largemouth bass virus The Lake has been reported as infected with Largemouth Bass Virus (LMBV). Fish should not be transferred from this lake, and care should be taken to disinfect livewells with bleach after fishing this lake. Characteristics A small channel on the south end of the lake connects to the Mississippi River. This channel permits spawning fish to enter Lake Whittington, and provides recreational boaters with access to the river. The channel also causes water levels in Lake Whittington to rise and fall along with the seasonal variations in water level in the Mississippi River. During the fall, when water levels in the Mississippi River are typically at their lowest, Lake Whittington may be completely cut off from the river, and water levels in the lake decrease to form three pools of water. Fish species found in Lake Whittington include bream (bluegill), buffalo, channel catfish, common carp, crappie, drum, flathead catfish, gar, green sunfish, largemouth bass, minnows, silversides, sunfish, white bass, and yellow bass. Duckweed is the major aquatic vegetation. Although the lake can be legally fished with either an Arkansas or Mississippi fishing license, all vehicles and most recreational boats can only access the lake from Mississippi.

Background  It is not known when Li Yichao was born. He was the second son of Li Renfu.

Campaign against Later Tang forces  When Li Renfu died in 933, the officers of the circuit supported Li Yichao to succeed him, and he claimed the title of acting military governor, and thereafter sought to be officially commissioned as military governor from Later Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. However, Li Siyuan, the emperor of Later Tang, to which Li Renfu was formally a vassal, had long suspected Li Renfu of being in secret communications with Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, and therefore wanted to dislodge Li Yichao from Dingnan. So, he issued an edict commissioning Li Yichao as the acting military governor of nearby Zhangwu Circuit (ÂΩ∞Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi), while commissioning Zhangwu's military governor An Congjin as the acting military governor of Dingwu. He also had Yao Yanchou () the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), command 50,000 soldiers, to try to escort An to Dingnan. He also issued an edict addressing the people of Dingnan, stating that he felt that Li Yichao was too young to defend the border region that Dingnan was, stating that if he followed the imperial orders, he would receive the great honors that Li Congyan and Gao Yuntao () received (after their respective fathers' deaths) and if he disobeyed them, he would received the disasters that Wang Du and Li Kuangbin () received. Li Yichao refused to follow Li Siyuan's orders. Rather, he sent his older brother or cousin (only known historically by the nickname of Prince Aluo () to defend against the Later Tang attack at Qingling Gate (ÈùíÂ∂∫ÈñÄ, in modern Yan'an), and also gathered up all Dangxiang tribesmen in his territory for the defense. The Later Tang forces under Yao and An put Xia Prefecture under siege. However, the city walls were said to be exceedingly firm based on original construction by Helian Bobo, and the Dangxiang tribesmen were able to effectively cut off food supply routes of the Later Tang army such that it was difficult to resupply the army. Li Yichao and his brothers went on the city walls and begged An to withdraw, stating to him: Upon hearing about this plea, Li Siyuan ordered a withdrawal. It was said that from this point on, Dingnan viewed the imperial government lightly, such that whenever there were rebellions against the imperial government, it would get in communications with the rebels to demand bribes in order to aid them against the imperial government.  As military governor of Dingnan  In winter 933, at Li Yichao's request, Li Siyuan formally made him the military governor of Dingnan. In 935, Li Yichao fell ill, and he submitted a petition asking that his brother (older, according to the Zizhi Tongjian‚Äîand therefore may be the same person as Prince AluoZizhi Tongjian, vol. 279.‚Äîor younger, according to the Old History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five DynastiesNew History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40.), Li Yiyin, be put in charge of Dingnan.

For definition as both music and visual, see and . For definition as both a genre and an Internet meme, see: * : \\"Indeed, vaporwave circulates more like a 'meme' than a music genre. ... vaporwave is defined almost entirely by its online subculture. ... it is characterized by an intense material and citational reflexivity in relation to the Internet. ... Vaporwave's \\"memetic\\" subculture ... also portrays a profound shift in the material mediation of music online.\\" * * It is defined partly by its slowed- down, chopped samples of smooth jazz, elevator, R&B;, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s. The surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos. Vaporwave originated as an ironic variant of chillwave, evolving from hypnagogic pop as well as similar retro-revivalist and post-Internet motifs that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the era, such as Tumblr's seapunk. The style was pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin, and Ramona Xavier, who each used various pseudonyms. After Xavier's album Floral Shoppe (2011) established a blueprint for the genre, the movement built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan while a flood of new acts, also operating under online pseudonyms, turned to Bandcamp for distribution. Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour, although most have waned in popularity. The genre also intersected with fashion trends such as streetwear and various political movements. Since the mid-2010s, vaporwave has been frequently described as a \\"dead\\" genre. The general public came to view vaporwave as a facetious Internet meme, a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with vaporwave have since drifted into other musical styles. Characteristics Vaporwave is a hyper- specific subgenre (or \\"microgenre\\") that is both a form of electronic music and an art style, although it is sometimes suggested to be primarily a visual medium. The genre is defined largely by its surrounding subculture, with its music inextricable from its visual accountrements. Academic Laura Glitsos writes, \\"In this way, vaporwave defies traditional music conventions that typically privilege the music over the visual form.\\" Drawing primarily on musical and cultural sources from the 1980s and early 1990s, vaporwave builds upon the experimental and ironic tendencies of chillwave and hypnagogic pop, while also being associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and technoculture. The name derives from \\"vaporware\\", a term for commercial software that is announced but never released. Creating a vaporwave track requires only the knowledge of rudimentary production techniques. It is composed almost entirely from slowed-down samples and subverts dance music from the 1980s and 1990s through the use of chopped and screwed techniques, repetition, and heavy reverb. Critic Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for \\"music made less for enjoyment than for the regulation of mood\\", such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations. Academic Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as \\"a wholly synthesised or heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality.\\" Adding to its dual engagement with musical and visual art forms, vaporwave embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic medium. The visual aesthetic (often stylized as \\"\\", with fullwidth characters) incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes, as well as anime, Greco- Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects. VHS degradation is another common effect seen in vaporwave art. Generally, artists limit their source material between Japan's economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers). History=Origins and precursors Vaporwave originated on the Internet in the early 2010s as an ironic variant of chillwave and as a derivation of the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro, who were also characterized by the invocation of retro popular culture. It was one of many Internet microgenres to emerge in this era, alongside witch house, seapunk, shitgaze, cloud rap, and others. Vaporwave coincided with a broader trend involving young artists whose works drew from their childhoods in the 1980s. \\"Chillwave\\" and \\"hypnagogic pop\\" were coined at virtually the same time, in mid-2009, and were considered interchangeable terms. Like vaporwave, they engaged with notions of nostalgia and cultural memory. Among the earliest hypnagogic acts to anticipate vaporwave was Matrix Metals and his album Flamingo Breeze (2009), which was built on synthesizer loops. Around the same time, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) uploaded a collection of plunderphonics loops to YouTube surreptitiously under the alias sunsetcorp. These clips were taken from his audio-visual album Memory Vague (June 2009). Washed Out's \\"Feel It All Around\\" (June 2009), which slowed down the 1983 Italian dance song \\"I Want You\\" by Gary Low, exemplified the \\"analog nostalgia\\" of chillwave that vaporwave artists sought to reconfigure. Vaporwave was subsumed under a larger \\"Tumblr aesthetic\\" that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the 2010s. In 2010, Lopatin included several of the tracks from Memory Vague, as well as a few new ones, on his album Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, released in August under the alias \\"Chuck Person\\". With packaging that resembled the 1993 video game Ecco the Dolphin, the album inspired a host of suburban teens and young adults to formulate what would become vaporwave. Seapunk followed in mid-2011 as an aquatic-themed Tumblr subculture and Internet meme that presaged vaporwave in its concern for \\"spacey\\" electronic music and Geocities web graphics. Like vaporwave, it was defined by its engagement with the Internet (sometimes described as post- Internet). The musical template for vaporwave came from Eccojams and Ferraro's Far Side Virtual (October 2011). Eccojams featured chopped and screwed variations on popular 1980s pop songs, while Far Side Virtual drew primarily on \\"the grainy and bombastic beeps\\" of past media such as Skype and the Nintendo Wii. According to Stereogums Miles Bowe, vaporwave was a fusion between Lopatin's \\"chopped and screwed plunderphonics\\" and the \\"nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro‚Äôs Muzak-hellscapes\\". A 2013 post on a music blog presented those albums, along with Skeleton's Holograms (November 2010), as \\"proto vaporwave\\". Early scene Vaporwave artists were originally \\"mysterious and often nameless entities that lurk the internet,\\" Adam Harper noted, \\"often behind a pseudo-corporate name or web fa√ßade, and whose music is typically free to download through Mediafire, Last FM, Soundcloud or Bandcamp.\\" According to Metallic Ghosts (Chaz Allen), the original vaporwave scene came out of an online circle formulated on the site Turntable.fm. This circle included individuals known as Internet Club (Robin Burnett), Veracom, Luxury Elite, Infinity Frequencies, Transmuteo (Jonathan Dean), Coolmemoryz, and Prismcorp. The cover artwork for Floral Shoppe (2011) by Macintosh Plus features elements that would come to exemplify the vaporwave aesthetic, including retro computer imagery, Japanese lettering, and pixelated graphics. Numerous producers of this online milieu took inspiration from Ramona Xavier's New Dreams Ltd. (credited to \\"Laserdisc Visions\\", July 2011). The first reported use of the term \\"vaporwave\\" was on an October 2011 blogpost by an anonymous user reviewing the album Surf's Pure Hearts by Girlhood, however, Burnett has been credited with coining the term as a way to tie the circle together. Xavier's Floral Shoppe (credited to \\"Macintosh Plus\\", December 2011) was the first album to be properly considered of the genre, containing all of the style's core elements. Vaporwave found wider appeal over the middle of 2012, building an audience on sites like Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan. On Tumblr, it became common for users to decorate their pages with vaporwave imagery. In September, Blank Banshee released his debut album, Blank Banshee 0, which reflected a trend of vaporwave producers who were more influenced by trap music and less concerned with conveying political undertones. Bandwagon called it a \\"progressive record\\" that, along with Floral Shoppe, \\"signaled the end of the first wave of sample-heavy music, and ... reconfigured what it means to make vaporwave music.\\" After a flood of new vaporwave acts turned to Bandcamp for distribution, various online music publications such as Tiny Mix Tapes, Dummy and Sputnikmusic began covering the movement. However, writers, fans, and artists struggled to differentiate between vaporwave, chillwave, and hypnagogic pop, while Ash Becks of The Essential noted that larger sites like Pitchfork and Drowned in Sound \\"seemingly refused to touch vaporwave throughout the genre‚Äôs two-year 'peak'.\\" Common criticisms were that the genre was \\"too dumb\\" or \\"too intellectual\\". Mainstream exposure and \\"death\\" In November 2012, seapunk aesthetics were appropriated in music videos by the pop singers Rihanna and Azealia Banks. The exposure catapulted the subculture to the mainstream, and with it, vaporwave. That same month, a video review of Floral Shoppe, published by the YouTuber Anthony Fantano, helped solidify the album as the representative work of vaporwave. Soon after vaporwave was spotlighted in the mainstream, it was frequently described as a \\"dead\\" genre. Such pronouncements came from the fans themselves. Following the initial wave, new terms were invented by users on 4chan and Reddit who sought to separate vaporwave into multiple subgenres. Some were created in jest, such as \\"vaportrap\\", \\"vapornoise\\" and \\"vaporgoth\\". Further subgenres included \\"eccojams\\", \\"utopian virtual\\", \\"mallsoft\\", \\"future funk\\", \\"post-Internet\\", \\"late-nite lo-fi\\", \\"broken transmission\\" (or \\"signalwave\\"), and \\"hardvapour\\". Joe Price of Complex reported that \\"most [of the subgenres] faded away, and many didn‚Äôt make sense to begin with. ... The visual aspect formed faster than the sound, resulting in releases that look the same but fail to form a sonically cohesive whole.\\" Yung Lean (pictured 2013) popularized fusions of vaporwave with rap music In 2013, YouTube began allowing its users to host live streams, which resulted in a host of 24-hour \\"radio stations\\" dedicated to microgenres such as vaporwave and lo-fi hip hop. The Swedish rapper Yung Lean and his Sad Boys collective inspired a wave of anonymous DJs to create vaporwave mixes, uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud, that appropriated the music and imagery of Nintendo 64 video games. Titles included \\"Mariowave\\", \\"Nostalgia 64\\", and \\"Z E L D A W A V E\\". Dazed Digitals Evelyn Wang credited Lean with \\"allowing vaporwave to leak IRL [and] encouraging its unholy coupling with streetwear\\". She cited their associated fashion staples as \\"frowny faces, Japanese and Arabic as accessories, sportswear brands, Arizona iced tea, and the uncanny ability to simultaneously communicate in and be a meme.\\" At the end of 2013, Thump published an essay headlined \\"Is Vaporwave the Next Seapunk?\\" Although the author prophesied that vaporwave would not end \\"as a joke\\" the way seapunk did, the genre came to be largely viewed as a facetious Internet meme based predominately on a retro visual style or \\"vibe\\", a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with the genre later drifted into other musical styles. In 2015, Rolling Stone published a list that included vaporwave act 2814 as one of \\"10 artists you need to know\\", citing their album Birth of a New Day as \\"an unparalleled success within a small, passionate pocket of the internet.\\" The album I'll Try Living Like This by Death's Dynamic Shroud.wmv was featured at number fifteen on the Fact list \\"The 50 Best Albums of 2015\\", and on the same day MTV International introduced a rebrand heavily inspired by vaporwave and seapunk, Tumblr launched a GIF viewer named Tumblr TV, with an explicitly MTV-styled visual spin. Hip-hop artist Drake's single \\"Hotline Bling\\", released on July 31, also became popular with vaporwave producers, inspiring both humorous and serious remixes of the tune. As of 2016, vaporwave albums, including Floral Shoppe, continued to rank among the best-selling experimental albums on Bandcamp. The scene also maintained a dedicated following on communities such as Reddit. Price reported that, for those outside of these arenas, the genre was generally considered to be \\"a big joke\\". He added that \\"Users of the various vaporwave sub-Reddits will always take it very seriously for the most part, but even there people are discussing whether or not vaporwave is still going strong.\\" Despite their objections to the label, serious artists of the movement continued to be tagged as vaporwave. In 2019, user comments that state \\"Ôº°Ôº•Ôº≥Ôº¥Ôº®Ôº•Ôº¥Ôº©Ôº£\\" remained ubiquitous on YouTube videos concerning the Internet. George Clanton, a prominent figure in the genre, commented that the \\"vaporwave\\" banner still functioned well as a marketing tag for music that is not necessarily considered of the genre. In September, he organized the first- ever vaporwave festival 100% ElectroniCON, in New York City, where various artists associated with the genre such as Saint Pepsi, Vaperror, Nmesh, 18 Carat Affair, and Clanton himself performed live, most of them for the first time in their careers. Political appropriations In December 2012, Dummy published what was considered the \\"definitive\\" article on vaporwave, authored by Adam Harper, in which he equated the genre to accelerationist political theory. The article had the effect of inspiring \\"a wave of content ambiguously celebrating a dystopian capitalism\\". In early 2016, the satirical publication Rave News reported that prominent vaporwave producers had scheduled an emergency summit in Montreal to discuss \\"creeping fascism\\" in the scene. Although the article was facetious, its comment section attracted many vaporwave fans who defended such political beliefs. In August, Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin recommended that alt-right members embrace synthwave instead of the rock genres traditionally associated with far-right movements, as he felt that synthwave represented the \\"Whitest music ever\\". His remarks popularized the musical and visual aesthetic dubbed \\"fashwave\\", an updating of fascist tropes inspired by vaporwave that was celebrated by many members of the alt-right. In 2017, Vice Penn Bullock and Eli Penn reported on the phenomenon of self-identified fascists and alt-right members appropriating vaporwave music and aesthetics, describing the fashwave movement as \\"the first fascist music that is easy enough on the ears to have mainstream appeal\\" and reflective of \\"a global cybernetic subculture geared towards millennials, propagated by memes like Pepe the Frog, and centered on sites like 4chan\\". The Guardians Michael Hann noted that the movement is not unprecedented; similar offshoots occurred in punk rock in the 1980s and black metal in the 1990s. Hann believed that, like those genres, there was little chance fashwave would ever \\"impinge on the mainstream\\". By 2019, pink vaporwave-inspired hats that promoted 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang became popular among his supporters. National Review commentator Theodore Kopfre reported that it was part of a trend indicating that Yang had \\"replaced Donald Trump as the meme candidate.\\" Critical interpretations=Parody, subversion, and genre Vaporwave was one of several microgenres spawned in the early 2010s that were the brief focus of media attention. Users on various music forums, as quoted by Vice, variously characterized the genre as \\"chillwave for Marxists\\", \\"post- elevator music\\", and \\"corporate smooth jazz Windows 95 pop\\". Its circulation was more akin to an Internet meme than typical music genres of the past, as authors Georgina Born and Christopher Haworth wrote in 2017, Pitchfork contributor Jonny Coleman defined vaporwave as residing in \\"the uncanny genre valley\\" that lies \\"between a real genre that sounds fake and a fake genre that could be real.\\" Also from Pitchfork, Patrick St. Michel calls vaporwave a \\"niche corner of Internet music populated by Westerners goofing around with Japanese music, samples, and language\\". Vice writer Rob Arcand commented that the \\"rapid proliferation of subgenres has itself become part of the \\"vaporwave\\" punchline, gesturing at the absurdity of the genre itself even as it sees artists using it as a springboard for innovation.\\" Speaking about the \\"supposedly subversive or parodic elements\\" of vaporwave in 2018, cultural critic Simon Reynolds said that the genre had become redundant, in some respects, to modern trap music and mainstream hip hop. He opined: \\"What could be more insane or morbid than the subjectivity in a Drake record or a Kanye song? The black Rap n B mainstream is further out sonically and attitudinally than anything the white Internet-Bohemia has come up with. Their role is redundant. Rap and R&B; ... is already the Simulacrum, is already decadence.\\" In a 2018 Rolling Stone article that reported the Monkees' Mike Nesmith's enthusiasm for the genre, author Andy Greene described vaporwave as a \\"fringe electronic subgenre that few outside irony-soaked meme enthusiasts have even heard of, let alone developed an opinion on.\\" Nesmith praised the genre and attributed its sound to be highly reminiscent of psychedelic trips. Music critic Scott Beauchamp wrote that vaporwave's stance is more focused on loss, the notion of lassitude, and passive acquiescence, and that \\"vaporwave was the first musical genre to live its entire life from birth to death completely online\\". He suggested that expressions of hypermodulation inspired both the development and downfall of vaporwave. Capitalism and technology Vaporwave is cited for espousing an ambiguous or accelerationist relationship to consumer capitalism. Numerous academic books have been published on this subject, a trend that was provoked by Adam Harper's 2012 Dummy article and its attempt to link the genre to punk rock and anti-capitalist gestures. In the article, he wrote that vaporwave producers \\"can be read as sarcastic anti- capitalists revealing the lies and slippages of modern techno-culture and its representations, or as its willing facilitators, shivering with delight upon each new wave of delicious sound.\\" He noted that the name itself was both a nod to vaporware and the idea of libidinal energy being subjected to relentless sublimation under capitalism. Music educator Grafton Tanner wrote, \\"vaporwave is one artistic style that seeks to rearrange our relationship with electronic media by forcing us to recognize the unfamiliarity of ubiquitous technology ... vaporwave is the music of 'non-times' and 'non-places' because it is skeptical of what consumer culture has done to time and space\\". Commenting on the adoption of a vaporwave- and seapunk-inspired rebrand by MTV International, Jordan Pearson of Motherboard, Vice technology website, noted how \\"the cynical impulse that animated vaporwave and its associated Tumblr- based aesthetics is co-opted and erased on both sides‚Äîwhere its source material originates and where it lives\\". Beauchamp proposed a parallel between punk's \\"No Future\\" stance and its active \\"raw energy of dissatisfaction\\" deriving from the historical lineage of Dada dystopia, and vaporwave's preoccupation with \\"political failure and social anomie\\". Michelle Lhooq of Vice argued that \\"parodying commercial taste isn't exactly the goal. Vaporwave doesn't just recreate corporate lounge music ‚Äì it plumps it up into something sexier and more synthetic.\\" In his 2019 book Hearing the Cloud: Can Music Help Reimagine The Future?, academic Emilie Frankel wrote that vaporwave was reduced to \\"a commercial shell of itself\\" by those who fetishized the 1980s and \\"retro synth-pop\\". He likened the scene to PC Music, a label that \\"was seen to warp from an ironic affirmation of commercialism, to become just regular pop. ... Anything that uses irony as a method of critique runs the risk of misrecognition.\\" Offshoots and subgenres=Future funk Future funk expands upon the disco/house elements of vaporwave. It takes a more energetic approach than vaporwave and incorporates elements of French house, albeit produced in the same sample based manner as vaporwave. Most of these samples are drawn from Japanese city pop records from the 1980s. Hardvapour Hardvapour emerged in late 2015 as a reimagination of vaporwave with darker themes, faster tempos, and heavier sounds. It is influenced by speedcore and gabber, and defines itself against the utopian moods sometimes attributed to vaporwave. Mallsoft Mallsoft magnifies vaporwave's lounge influences. It may be viewed in connection to \\"the concept of malls as large, soulless spaces of consumerism ... exploring the social ramifications of capitalism and globalization\\". Fashwave Fashwave (from \\"fascist\\") is a largely instrumental fusion of synthwave and vaporwave that originated on YouTube circa 2015. With political track titles and occasional soundbites, the genre combines Nazi symbolism with the visuals associated with vaporwave and synthwave. According to Hann, it is musically derived from synthwave, while Heavy contributor Paul Farrell writes that it is \\"considered to be an offshoot from the harmless vaporwave movement.\\" A similar offshoot, Trumpwave, focuses on Donald Trump. Simpsonwave Simpsonwave was a YouTube phenomenon made popular by the user Lucien Hughes. It mainly consists of videos with scenes from the American animated television series The Simpsons set to various vaporwave tracks. Clips are often put together out of context and edited with VHS-esque distortion effects and surreal visuals, giving them a \\"hallucinatory and transportive\\" feel.

Without warning, Frederick suddenly struck at the invaders, trapping them in the fork of two major rivers. Though about 300 knights cut their way out, causing many non-combatant casualties, the Palatine forces were victorious. Frederick captured three of the enemy leaders and wrung ransoms and territorial concessions from them. Seckenheim is now part of the city of Mannheim in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The combat occurred during the Mainz Feud (Mainzer Stiftsfehde), part of the larger Bavarian War (1459‚Äì63). Background On 4 July 1460, Frederick I, Elector Palatine defeated Dieter von Isenburg in the Battle of Pfeddersheim. But in the fall of 1461, Pope Pius II replaced Dieter as archbishop of Mainz with Adolph II of Nassau. In his desire to reclaim his former position, Dieter sought Frederick's assistance and handed over substantial territories to the Palatinate as payment. Irritated by this defiance, the pope excommunicated both Dieter and Frederick in early 1462. At the same time, the pope's ally Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor declared war on the two. Ulrich V, Count of W√ºrttemberg, Louis I, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken, Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden and his brother George of Baden, Bishop of Metz formed a coalition against Frederick and in favor of Adolph II. In June 1462, the army of the anti-Frederick alliance invaded the Electoral Palatinate with a force between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers; they pillaged and burned property extensively. Their sources said that Frederick was not in his capital at Heidelberg, so the allied princes directed their army toward that place. Frederick was indeed at Heidelberg and he may have had spread reports to his absence in order to fool his enemies. Frederick rapidly massed 800 men-at-arms and 2,000 foot soldiers including Swiss mercenaries. Dieter arrived at the muster with 300 men-at- arms. In addition, many peasants also joined Frederick's army. Battle On 30 June 1462,See infobox photo for the date of the battle, which is on the metal plaque. Frederick sallied out of Heidelberg and caught a significant part of the allied host near Seckenheim, away from their fortified camp. The allies were trapped in the wedge between the Rhine and Neckar Rivers. Backed up against the rivers, the allied army prepared for battle. For recognition, they wore a badge of oat straws while the Palatine warriors wore hazel leaves on their helmets. Frederick marshaled his army in an echelon formation with his vanguard and men-at-arms in the center. On either side of the central mass was a double line of mounted crossbowmen. Frederick kept his infantry out of sight in a nearby forest. After some skirmishing, the heavy cavalry of both armies charged into each other. Frederick's men-at-arms barely prevented the allied horsemen from smashing through. As the cavalrymen hacked away at each other, Frederick's infantry emerged from its hiding place and closed around the allies. A body of 300 allied horsemen cut their way out and then fell upon the Palatine grooms as they waited on their men-at-arms. The hapless grooms were slaughtered, but the Palatine army won a decisive victory, killing over 40 knights for a loss of about 12 knights killed. Frederick's army gathered up 124 noblemen and 204 squires as prisoners. Among the captured were three enemy leaders, Charles of Baden-Baden, Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg, and Bishop George of Metz. Only Louis of Zweibr√ºcken avoided being made a prisoner. By the following year the princes had been ransomed for large sums and significant territories.

Thomas Condon wrote, in The Sanctifying Function of the Diocesan Bishop Especially in Relationship with Pastors, that this canon \\"empowers the bishop to regulate sacramental sharing for Catholics who might need to approach a non-Catholic minister; ... the canon enjoins the bishop to prevent a spirit of indifferentism from emerging because of sacramental sharing.\\" Condon wrote that Frederick R. McManus \\"noted that 'the intent of the canon is clear, namely to define the outer limits of permissible sharing of sacraments, aside from any question of validity or invalidity'.\\" The Second Vatican Council's decree on ecumenism, Unitatis Redintegratio (UR), states that \\"worship in common (') is not to be considered as a means to be used indiscriminately for the restoration of Christian unity.\\" In that context, John Beal's et al. New commentary on the Code of Canon Law notes that this canon does not address the specific question of \\"the seriousness of the need\\" on occasions of worship in common such as a marriage or funeral or similar ecumenical activities. Structure The structure of Canon 844, described in Ernest Caparros' et al. Code of Canon Law Annotated, is that the \\"general principle is established\\" first, then this canon \\"considers three situations of facts\\" which are exceptions, and finally this canon \\"regulates the lawful exercise of the normative activity in a particular area.\\" In Ecclesia de Eucharistia (EE), Pope John Paul II asked the Roman Curia \\"to prepare a more specific document, including prescriptions of a juridical nature,\\" which Daniel Merz wrote, in The Liturgy Documents, were \\"in light of liturgical abuses in violation of liturgical norms.\\" Within several months, in 2004, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CCDDS) gave those instructions in Redemptionis Sacramentum (RS). Merz made clear that \\"should be understood as binding norms for interpreting and carrying out the liturgical laws\\" and \\"is intended to be read as a companion to\\" . The instruction, in pertaining to this canon, is that \\"Catholic ministers licitly administer the Sacraments only to the Catholic faithful, who likewise receive them licitly only from Catholic ministers, except for those situations for which provision is made in\\" Canon 844 ¬ß¬ß2-4, and Canon 861 ¬ß2. Furthermore, \\"the conditions comprising\\" Canon 844 ¬ß4, \\"from which no dispensation can be given, cannot be separated; thus, it is necessary that all of these conditions be present together.\\" Principle The principle found in section one of Canon 844 is that \\"Catholic ministers administer the sacraments licitly to Catholic members of the Christian faithful alone.\\" \\"Paragraph one governs the licit, rather than the valid administration of sacraments to Catholics,\\" according to Condon. This principle covers all sacraments of the Catholic Church. \\"The general principle is clear\\" as Caparros et al. describes that \\"Catholic ministers may lawfully administer the sacraments to Catholic faithful, who in their turn may only receive them lawfully from Catholic ministers.\\" Exception one The first exception is cited in section one. Baptism, according to the , \\"is necessary for salvation\\" and is \\"the gateway to the sacraments\\"; through it, the recipient is \\"configured to Christ\\" by a sacramental character and \\"incorporated into the Church\\". The first exception to Canon 844 is that if \\"an ordinary minister is absent or impeded, a catechist or another person designated for this function by the local ordinary, or in a case of necessity any person with the right intention, confers baptism licitly.\\" So, for the ¬ß1 exception all of these conditions must be present together for licitness: *A case of necessity. *Any administrant, whether Catholic or non-Catholic or non-Christian, with the right intention. *Any recipient who is \\"not yet baptized\\". *Only for reception of the sacrament of Christian baptism. Exception two The second exception is found in section two. \\"Whenever necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it, and provided that danger of error or of indifferentism is avoided, the Christian faithful for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister are permitted to receive the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick from non- Catholic ministers in whose Churches these sacraments are valid.\\" Peter Vere pointed out \\"that the word 'Church' in\\" Canon 844 ¬ß2 is capitalized. \\"The canon does not say that Catholics may receive the aforementioned sacraments from 'non-Catholic ministers in whose churches these sacraments are valid.' In interpreting this canon,\\" Vere wrote, \\"it is important\\" to pay attention to the \\"legal norms\\" within the . Vere considered Canon 16 ¬ß1 and Canon 17: Canon 16 ¬ß1 \\"means that the canons contained within the\\" \\"are legitimately interpreted by\\" the legislator, i.e. Pope John Paul II \\"and his successors\\", and \\"those whom he has delegated to interpret the\\" . Canon 17 \\"means that the canons must be understood according to both the text and the context in which they find themselves. In cases of doubt, one should seek references elsewhere as to what was the purpose of the law, and the mind of the legislator in passing the law.\\" Applying the \\"legal norms\\" of Canon 16 ¬ß1 and Canon 17 to Canon 844 ¬ß2, \\"we see that the intention of the legislator, within the context of the canon, is to permit Catholics under certain circumstance to receive the sacraments from non-Catholic ministers of Churches in which the sacraments are valid. This is not a permission to receive the sacraments from non-Catholic ministers in whose churches the sacraments are valid. The difference being that the sacraments must be valid owing to the denominational Church to which the non-Catholic minister belongs, and not merely from the validity of the minister's ordination. For example, one could not receive the sacraments from a priest validly ordained within the Catholic Church who later defected from the Catholic Faith and now ministers within the Episcopalian ecclesial communion. Nor could one approach a validly-ordained non-Catholic minister who ministers the sacraments independently of the jurisdiction of a Church in which these sacraments are valid.\\" So, Vere wrote, applying the \\"legal norms\\" of Canon 17, \\"we must look at parallel laws to see what the legislator means by the term 'Church' when granting permission under\\" Canon 844 ¬ß2 \\"to receive the sacraments from non-Catholic ministers in whose Churches they are valid.\\" \\"The most important document that clarifies the mind and intention of the legislator,\\" wrote Vere, is the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity's (PCPCU) Directory for the application of principles and norms on ecumenism (1993ED) which contains \\"parallel laws\\" that \\"clarify the intention of the legislator with regards to\\" this canon. So, for the ¬ß2 exception all of these conditions must be present together for licitness: *A case of necessity, or a case of true spiritual advantage. Caparros et al. quoting from In quibus rerum circumstantiis remarked that, \\"It must be remembered that the sacraments 'are not mere instruments for satisfying individual desires only'.\\" *The minister is of a non-Catholic Eastern Church in which these sacraments are valid, or the minister is of a non-Catholic Western Church in which these sacraments are valid or \\"who is known to be validly ordained according to the Catholic teaching on ordination\\". The Catholic Church does not recognize the ordination of women, and believes specifically that Anglican ordinations are invalid. *Error and indifferentism are avoided. Caparros et al. comments that, \\"this is a basic criterion, expressed in 26\\" which states that participation in worship \\"which harms the unity of the Church or involves formal acceptance of error or the danger of aberration in the faith, of scandal and indifferentism, is forbidden.\\" In cases of doubt, the recipient should seek references elsewhere. A Catholic recipient who manifests indifference could not apply the provisions of this canon to licitly receive a sacrament from a non-Catholic minister. *The recipient is Catholic for whom access to a Catholic minister is physically or morally impossible. Beal et al. recognized this to include a limitation \\"such as serious inconvenience.\\" *Only for reception of three sacraments: Penance, Eucharist, and Anointing of the Sick. *Within the prescribed limits regulated by the diocesan bishop and conference of bishops. So to licitly apply the provisions of Canon 844 ¬ß 2, a Catholic recipient must, if possible, contact the Catholic diocese in which the sacrament might potentially be received, to understand the established norms and prohibitions of the diocesan bishop as well as about specific heretical or schismatic groups and ministers that may be operating in the area. If there is a prohibition, a Catholic recipient engaged in it could be \\"guilty of prohibited participation in sacred rites (')\\". *Practiced according to the norm that a recipient \\"who legitimately wishes to communicate with Eastern Christians must respect the Eastern discipline as much as possible and refrain from communicating if that Church restricts sacramental communion to its own members to the exclusion of others.\\" Vere considered Norm 123, Norm 130, Norm 131, and Norm 132. Vere identified the fact that, in conformity with Norm 123, \\"Catholics may enjoy the full benefit of\\" Canon 844 ¬ß2 \\"when approaching a minister of a non-Catholic Eastern Church in which the sacraments are valid, in order to receive the sacraments.\\" On the other hand, explains Vere, Norm 123 \\"does not apply when approaching the minister of a non-Catholic Western Church in which the sacraments are valid. Rather, this situation is covered under\\" the \\"much stricter\\" Norm 132. Accordingly, \\"before a Catholic may legally approach a non-Catholic minister within a Western Church in which the sacraments are valid, he must meet the further requirements of certain circumstances defined in\\" the . Considering that Norm 132 \\"specifies Church in the universal sense, and not Church ',\\" Vere points out that, \\"this norm cannot be interpreted in the sense that the Catholic is unable to approach a Catholic priest of his own liturgical rite.\\" =Society of St. Pius X= Vere wrote in 1999 that with respect to the canonical situation of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), \\"this prohibition has been confirmed\\" by the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (PCED), that Masses celebrated by the \\"are also valid, but it is considered morally illicit for the faithful to participate in these Masses unless they are physically or morally impeded from participating in a Mass celebrated by a Catholic priest in good standing.\\" Vere writes that the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (PCED), which, in some cases, \\"has been delegated the power of authentic interpretation of\\" Canon 844 ¬ß2, \\"does not consider the lack of opportunity to assist at a Tridentine Mass sufficient cause to receive the sacraments from a Lefebvrite cleric.\\" For this reason, \\"in light of\\" Canons 16-17 and Norms 130-132, \\"one cannot invoke\\" Canon 844 ¬ß2 \\"in order to receive the sacraments from a Lefebvrite priest simply because a Tridentine Mass is lacking.\\" \\"Furthermore,\\" because the does not claim ecclesiastical jurisdiction, wrote Vere, \\"the Catholic Church is not certain at the present whether the constitutes a Church like the Eastern Orthodox or the Polish National Catholic Church, or whether the is simply a loose federation of acephalous (independent) priests and episcopal vagantes (wandering bishops) like the Old Catholic Movement in North America. Thus where to classify the schism at the moment represents an internal dilemma for the Church,\\" According to the the \\"is not concerned with the\\" . \\"The situation of the members of\\" the \\"is an internal matter of the Catholic Church\\" and the \\"is not another Church or Ecclesial Community in the meaning used in the\\" . Analogously the Tribunal of the Roman Rota wrote about \\"dealing with a priest belonging in virtue of ordination to the\\" , \\"which lacked the necessary canonical legitimacy in the Church at the time of the celebration of the marriage,\\" under the circumstances, accordingly \\"was like an acephalous or transient or 'freelance' priest, and consequently, did not seek from anyone the faculty [...]\\" Because \\"the Holy See has prudently chosen not to classify the as a Church,\\" Vere wrote, \\"one cannot invoke\\" Canon 844 ¬ß2 \\"or the conditions of\\" Norm 123 or Norms 130-132 \\"in order to receive the sacraments from ministers.\\" Exception three The third exception is found in section three. \\"Catholic ministers administer the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick licitly to members of Eastern Churches which do not have full communion with the Catholic Church if they seek such on their own accord and are properly disposed. This is also valid for members of other Churches which in the judgment of the Apostolic See are in the same condition in regard to the sacraments as these Eastern Churches.\\" So, for the ¬ß3 exception all of these conditions must be present together for licitness: *A case when the sacrament is requested. Caparros et al. comments that, \\"any prior pressure by the Catholic minister is clearly forbidden.\\" *The minister is Catholic. *The recipient is a baptized properly disposed Eastern non- Catholic. Caparros et al. elucidates that, because \\"the word Oriental is very general, it is advisable to verify in each case that the subject fulfills the faith requirements laid down by ecclesiastical authority. This applies with equal strictness to members of other Churches that, in the opinion of the\\" Apostolic See, \\"are in a similar situation to the Oriental ones.\\" In the United States, this includes Christians of the Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, and the Polish National Catholic Church. *Only for reception of three sacraments: penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick. *Within the prescribed limits regulated by the diocesan bishop and conference of bishops. *Practiced according to the norm that \\"due consideration should be given to the discipline of the Eastern Churches for their own faithful\\". *Practiced according to the norm that \\"any suggestion of proselytism should be avoided.\\" Exception four The fourth exception is found in section four. \\"If the danger of death is present or if, in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops, some other grave necessity urges it, Catholic ministers administer these same sacraments licitly also to other Christians not having full communion with the Catholic Church, who cannot approach a minister of their own community and who seek such on their own accord, provided that they manifest Catholic faith in respect to these sacraments and are properly disposed.\\" So, for the ¬ß4 exception all of these conditions must be present together for licitness: *A case of a danger of death, or :a case of a grave necessity, in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops. *The minister is Catholic who \\"will judge individual cases and administer these sacraments only in accord with [...] established norms, where they exist\\" or \\"the norms of\\" . *The recipient is a baptized properly disposed Western non-Catholic with \\"manifest Catholic faith in this sacrament\\". *Only for reception of three sacraments: penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick. *Within the prescribed limits regulated by the diocesan bishop and conference of bishops. *Practiced according to the norm that the recipient is \\"unable to have recourse for the sacrament desired to a minister of his or her own Church or ecclesial Community\\". *Practiced according to the norm that the recipient \\"ask for the sacrament of his or her own initiative\\". Regulation The regulation is found in section five. \\"For the cases mentioned in ¬ß¬ß2, 3, and 4, the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops is not to issue general norms except after consultation at least with the local competent authority of the interested non-Catholic Church or community.\\" states that \\"it is strongly recommended that the diocesan Bishop, taking into account any norms which may have been established for this matter by the Episcopal Conference or by the Synods of Eastern Catholic Churches, establish general norms for judging situations of grave and pressing need and for verifying the conditions\\" Beal et al. elaborated that in consideration of the ethic of reciprocity, \\"the underlying purpose\\" in ¬ß5 is \\"not to act unilaterally\\" but the language \\"is carefully constructed to leave the diocesan bishop\\" or conference of bishops \\"free to act in individual cases\\" or issue norms regardless of any consultation with another Church or Ecclesial Community. \\"The course to be adopted, with due regard to all the circumstances of time, place, and persons,\\" states, \\"is to be decided by local episcopal authority, unless otherwise provided for by the Bishops' Conference according to its statutes, or by the Holy See.\\" NotesReferencesFurther reading Only information that conforms to the 2004 changes found in can be considered current. * * External links Only information that conforms to the 2004 changes found in can be considered current. * Category:Sacramental law Category:Canons (canon law) ","title":"Canon 844"},{"id":"41884530","text":"Catch, or playing catch, is one of the most basic children's games, often played between children or between a parent and child, wherein the participants throw a ball, beanbag, flying disc or similar object back and forth to each other. At early stages in a child's life, having a catch is a good way to evaluate and improve the child's physical coordination.Berry Brazelton, Margaret A. Kenna, The Children's Hospital Guide to Your Child's Health and Development (2001), p. 224. . Notably, \\"[i]f a child cannot catch a ball that he or she is bouncing, it is unlikely the child will be able to play catch\\".Marjorie Kostelnik, Alice Whiren, Anne Soderman, Guiding Children's Social Development and Learning (2014), p. 219. . Most children begin to be able to play catch around the age of four. Many four-year-olds instinctively close their eyes when a ball is heading towards them, and it can take some time to overcome this. Playing catch can help develop dexterity, coordination and confidence. Because playing catch requires at least two participants, and because participants can be substituted at any point during the game, catch can be used to place children in social situations where they will interact with each other. For example, this can be done by first having one child play catch with an adult, and then bringing other children into the game or substituting another child for the adult, at which point the adult can leave entirely.Natalie Elman, Eileen Kennedy-Moore, The Unwritten Rules of Friendship: Simple Strategies to Help Your Child Make Friends (2008), p. 133. . As children become more adept at the skills used to catch a thrown object and return it to the thrower, these skills are incorporated into more complex games played with larger groups of participants, such as hot potato, dodgeball, and keep away.

Family, education, and early career Henry van Zile Hyde was born on March 3, 1906 into a prominent Syracuse, N.Y. family. He was the second son of Henry Neal Hyde, an Episcopal priest, and Madeleine van Zile. Hyde graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1925 and from Yale University in 1929. He was a 1933 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Johns Hopkins University Medical School, where he was also elected to Alpha Omega Alpha, the medical honor society. Soon after graduating from medical school, on June 24, 1933, Hyde married Ellen Sedgwick Tracy, also from a prominent Syracuse family. Hyde served his medical internship at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and his residency in internal and pulmonary medicine at Strong Memorial Hospital at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY. In 1936 he established a practice of internal medicine in Syracuse. In 1938 he received a diploma from the Trudeau Institute, a center for the study and treatment of tuberculosis in Saranac Lake, N.Y. Hyde was a Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Preventive Medicine. During his first years in medical practice, Hyde was also engaged in pneumonia research for a New York state program, at a time when there was no known cure for pneumonia and when many people succumbed to the disease. Hyde‚Äôs work came to the attention of the state health department and in early 1941, he was appointed chief of the New York State Bureau of Pneumonia Control in Albany, NY ‚Äì his first venture into public health. WWII years Hyde‚Äôs arrival in Albany in 1941 coincided with the advent of the American involvement in World War II. Within four months Hyde was recruited into the United States Public Health Service (USPHS), initially at the rank of Commander and Senior Surgeon. He was assigned as the medical director for Region 2 of the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD), a wartime department with responsibilities now covered by the Departments of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Region 2 encompassed the densely populated areas of New York City, New Jersey and Delaware. At the time, the United States feared an East Coast air or sea attack from German forces. At OCD, Hyde was responsible for all the emergency medical responses, as well as civilian preparedness, in such an event. Along with Eleanor Roosevelt, then the unsalaried assistant director of OCD. Hyde made presentations to medical and hospital professionals and community organizations about the urgency for preparations and the pressing problems surrounding their accomplishment. In early 1943, at the request of James M. Landus, Dean of the Harvard Law School on leave as director of OCD, Hyde went to Washington as chief of the Field Casualty Section. When it was determined that an imminent attack on the US homeland was low, Hyde was assigned to the Foreign Economic Administration and sent to Cairo, Egypt to head the Medical Division of the Middle East Supply Centre (MESC). The MESC was ‚Äúan Anglo-American agency that had complete control over the flow of civilian supplies to the Middle East. The Medical Division was concerned with medical and health supplies required by the twenty countries in that region.‚Äù The director of MESC, with whom Hyde worked at that time, was Australian Commander Sir Robert G. A. Jackson. When Jackson went to London to become Senior Deputy Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) serving under Herbert Lehman and Fiorello La Guardia, Hyde became chief of the Middle East office of UNRRA. Hyde‚Äôs office was responsible for all the refuge camps in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai and North Africa, together totaling over 80,000 refugees from Greece and Yugoslavia. These civilians had been evacuated as part of the Allied ruse to have the Axis powers believe they were going to be invaded through the Balkans and not at the beaches of Normandy. Hyde served in Cairo from March 1944 until the end of the war, flying home on VJ Day, August 14, 1945; in September of that year he returned to Washington, where he became assistant chief of the Health Services Bureau of the Department of State. World Health Organization Between August and October 1944, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Nationalist China met at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., where they agreed to establish the United Nations (UN) for the purpose of maintaining international peace. At the Dumbarton Oaks conference, these four international powers also agreed that the UN should address economic and social problems for which an Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the UN would be responsible. In April 1945, a 50-nation international conference was held in San Francisco to form the United Nations (UN). Delegates from several nations, including the US, noted that there was no specialized health agency included in the proposed UN Charter. Realizing that it was too late to have one included, Dr. Geraldo de Paula Sousa of the Brazilian delegation and Dr. Szeming Sze of the Chinese delegation managed to have a declaration inserted instead, recommending a specialized agency for international health. At the ECOSOC‚Äôs inaugural meeting held on February 7, 1946, the delegates agreed to call an international health conference and to establish a Technical Preparatory Committee (TPC) to prepare for the meeting. Behind the scenes Thomas Parran, Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service, assisted by Henry van Zile Hyde and Wilson Jameson, Chief Medical Officer of the British Ministry of Health, engaged in a lengthy correspondence to decide whom to invite to the TPC. After working for the MESC, Hyde insisted that a Middle Eastern delegate be invited, a proposal with which his British colleagues did not initially agree. Hyde insisted, suggesting that Dr. Aly Tewfik Shousha, an Egyptian, be the representative, which was eventually accepted. Eventually, 16 international public health experts were invited to the TPC. Thomas Parran represented the United States at the TPC meeting, with Henry van Zile Hyde as his alternate. The TPC met in Paris in March and April 1946. ‚ÄúIn the course of only twenty-two meetings the Committee succeeded in drawing up an annotated agenda for the Health Conference, proposals ‚Äì amounting to a draft ‚Äì for a virtually complete constitution for the new health organization, and a series of relevant resolutions.‚Äù The World Health Organization was born. During the TPC, and in particular the drafting of the WHO constitution, Hyde suggested including a preamble to the Constitution, which was accepted by the committee. Hyde wrote to his wife: ‚ÄúIt [the preamble] presents 13 fundamental truths and I believe can become an Atlantic charter of health.‚Äù Andrija Stampar introduced the first draft preamble that was edited by the drafting committee, for which Hyde was the secretary. Working on the sub-committee for the preamble, Hyde collaborated closely with Brock Chisholm and Szeming Sze, who claimed authorship of the now very famous first principle, namely that ‚Äúhealth is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.‚Äù Three months after the Paris meetings, in June 1946, the International Health Conference was convened in New York with representatives of all fifty-one- member nations of the UN attending. Countries that were not yet members attended as observers, along with the Allied Control Authorities for Germany, Japan and Korea. The conference voted to accept the constitution as presented in the draft submitted by the TPC, with only relatively minor changes. Other important decisions were made in New York. Among them, an Interim Commission (IC) was set up to ‚Äúmake preparations for the First World Health Assembly, to carry on without interruption the surviving activities of the League of Nations Health Organization and those of the Office International d‚ÄôHygieve Publique (OIHP) and UNRRA, and to perform other urgent duties pending the final establishment of the Organization.‚Äù Thomas Parran was designated a member of the IC with Hyde as his alternate. When Thomas Parran resigned as Surgeon General in October 1947 Hyde took over Parran‚Äôs WHO responsibilities, leading the US delegation at the IC. The IC worked for two years until the first WHO Assembly met in July 1948. On October 18, 1948, President Truman appointed Hyde the United States representative to the Executive Board of the WHO. The Senate subsequently confirmed the appointment. Hyde was reappointed to the Board by President Eisenhower in 1953 and 1957, and by President Kennedy in 1961. He was chairman of the WHO Executive Board in 1954 and 1955, and eventually retired from his position with the WHO in 1962. During Hyde‚Äôs tenure as the American representative to the WHO, he focused much of his attention on malaria eradication, with the idea that post-WWII states would develop more quickly with a healthy workforce. While some have argued that the WHO‚Äôs malaria campaigns in the 1950s were a form of Cold War politics, none of this discourse exists in any of Hyde‚Äôs published writings or personal letters. Hyde was intimately concerned with and disturbed by poverty and poverty- related illness, particularly in the developing world. International public health was not the means to a political end for Hyde. And with respect to Cold War politics, Hyde consistently fought with the US Congress to give money to the WHO without putting political restrictions on its members, including the Soviet Union. Hyde even petitioned Secretary of State James F. Byrnes in 1946 to establish a formal U.S. policy statement on this matter (which Byrnes apparently denied). During the 16 years in which Hyde represented the United States at the WHO, he also held other positions in the State Department and USPHS: he was assistant chief of the Division of International Labor, Social and Health Affairs for the Department of State (1945-1948); Assistant Chief of the Division of International Health of the USPHS (1948-1949); Division Director for Health and Sanitation at the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (1950-1952); Director of Health and Sanitation at the Technical Cooperation Administration (1952-1953); Assistant to the Surgeon General for International Health (1953-1958); from 1958-1962, served as director of the division of International Health at the USPHS. Political missions to communist states: the USSR and Cuba In 1949, with the Cold War gathering speed and for various political reasons, the USSR resigned its membership in the WHO, not to return again until 1956. The return was due largely to the post-Stalin era warming in international relations. A renewed interest in scientific and cultural exchanges was spearheaded by Nikita Khrushchev and President Eisenhower, who had encouraged people-to-people contacts in his efforts to ‚Äúwage peace.‚Äù The initial official exchanges were in the sciences and the arts. The exchanges were later formalized in the Lacy-Zaroubin Agreement, in which the USSR and the US agreed to exchange experts to gather information and encourage understanding and cooperation between the two nations. The first of the exchanges was a visit to the USSR (August 13 through September 14, 1957) made by US public health experts, along with an arts exchange that included Hollywood stars of film. Hyde was one of the five-member US public health mission that included Thomas Parran, then Dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health; Otis L. Anderson, Assistant Surgeon General; Malcolm Merrill, California‚Äôs Director of Public Health; and Leonid Snegireff, Professor at the Harvard University School of Public Health. This group traveled to seven regions throughout the USSR, observing and noting the research and medical practices in the country at that time. The objective of the mission was to open the way for the development of more active relationships between public health and medical leaders of the USA and the USSR; and, to facilitate the exchange of technical information in the health fields. In September 1959, Nikita Khrushchev toured the US, bringing with him Aleksandr Markov, his personal physician and an official in the Soviet health ministry, and Markov‚Äôs colleague Dr. V.M. Butrov. The two Russian physicians traveled with Khrushchev throughout the US, visiting major US medical centers along the way before returning to Washington. Markov and Butrov then met with Surgeon General Leroy Burney and Hyde to prepare proposals for continuing and expanding the scientific exchange program to be considered by Khrushchev and President Eisenhower at their upcoming Camp David meeting. In further meetings with the leaders and scientists at the National Institutes of Health, the expected agreement included the addition of a joint US and USSR collaboration in health research. On December 26, 1962, just two months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Hyde was contacted by the American Red Cross to serve on a special mission to Cuba. Hyde accompanied two pharmacists on a chartered flight to Havana arriving on January 2. This medical team met with Fidel Castro to negotiate the release of several political prisoners in Cuba in exchange for medical supplies. One reason Hyde was chosen was that he knew most of the prominent leaders in the Cuban medical community from his work with the WHO. The trip lasted only five days, and Hyde flew back to the US on January 7. Post-government years In 1962, after 20 years in the USPHS, Hyde retired from government service and became the Director of International Medical Education at the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). That same year he arranged for the representatives of the University of Rochester and the University of Lagos, Nigeria to meet to discuss arrangements for faculty recruitment and exchanges for the newly opened Medical School. The exchange was subsequently supported the Commonwealth Fund of New York. While at AAMC, Hyde was organizer and on the steering committee for the Institute on International Medical Education‚Äôs conference, ‚ÄúManpower for the World‚Äôs Health,‚Äù convened in Washington, DC in March 1966, and editor of its subsequent journal. In 1972, Hyde retired from the AAMC and became a founding member and executive director of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). He was one of the moving forces behind that organization‚Äôs first international conference, ‚ÄúPopulation Change: A Strategy for Physicians‚Äù held in Stockholm in September 1974, which addressed the issue of ‚Äúmounting global concern over the precarious balance between population growth and the world‚Äôs space and resources‚Ä¶and the medical profession‚Äôs unique technical and leadership potential.‚Äù Hyde was the Executive Director of WFME at the time of his death in Bethesda, Maryland on November 5, 1982.

Helen Marot (June 9, 1865 ‚Äì June 3, 1940) was an American writer, librarian, and labor organizer. She is best remembered for her efforts to address child labor and improve the working conditions of women. She was from Philadelphia and became active in investigating working conditions among children and women. As a librarian, she worked at several important institutions and helped organize the Free Library of Economics and Political Science in 1897. Marot was a member of the Women's Trade Union League. She later organized the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union in New York. In 1912, she was part of a commission that investigated the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. She was an active writer and her articles about the labor movement appeared in many periodicals of the day. Early life Marot was born on June 9, 1865 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She grew up in an affluent family and received a Quaker education. From 1895 to 1896, Marot was the literary editor of Ladies' Home Journal where she was responsible for answering literary queries to the magazine. During this time, she compiled a 288-page reader's guide containing over 5,000 books. Included were some 170 author summaries. Early library work Marot left Ladies' Home Journal in April 1896 to organize the King Library of the Church of the Redeemer in Andalusia, Pennsylvania. In September 1896 she worked as a librarian in Wilmington, Delaware as a cataloger. She stayed at the library for three years. The head librarian at the time, Enos L. Doan, remarked on her work: \\"She brought to it taste and literary discrimination of a high order‚Äîqualities which, in addition to her thorough technical training, gave her unusual efficiency in the performance of her duties.\\" The Free Library of Economics and Political Science In 1897 Marot, along with Dr. George M. Gould and Innes Forbes, opened a private library specializing in works on social and economic topics. The Free Library of Economics and Political Science concentrated on issues relating to social and economic reform and was greatly influenced by The Fabian Society, a socialist organization. It was located on the second floor of a department store on Filbert Street in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Record described the library in its pages on June 15, 1897: > Philadelphia has been enriched with a library distinctively modern and > progressive in spirit... The new library forms an important supplement to > the municipal system, since the topics of the day and the problems of the > industrial and sociological world cannot be thoroughly followed by an > institution for the general circulation of books. With its proposed > technical classification of magazine literature and an accessible collection > of pamphlets and volumes, the Library of Economics should become a powerful > factor for civic and social education in the community and > Commonwealth.Gaudioso, M. (1992). Helen Marot: Librarian, 1865-1901. (Order > No. 1350082, San Jose State University). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Marot explained the importance of the library in 1902: \\"It was founded on the idea that freely offered opportunities from education in economics and political science make directly for a more intelligent public opinion and a higher citizenship.\\" The collection included foreign and domestic literature. It consisted of six hundred books, over two thousand pamphlets, and ninety-one periodicals. This literature, more particularly the periodicals, was not found elsewhere and thus met a most specific community need. The entire collection was donated by individuals and various organizations such as American Academy of Political and Social Science, Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Church Social Union, Civic Club of Philadelphia, Direct Legislation League, Englishwoman's Review, Fabian Society, Humboldt Publishing Company, Independent Labour Party, Indian Rights Association, Labor Exchange, and Land Nationalization League, among others. To keep up to date with current information, the library collected news clippings and government publications, reports of labor societies, and other similar works. Indeed, a considerable part of the collection consisted of government, state, and municipal reports received from the United States government, the different states, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and New South Wales. Although the collection was small, teachers, students, and library patrons found its classified and indexed pamphlets and magazine literature concerning present-day problems to be satisfactory. In addition, the patrons could purchase books and were permitted to check out books when they were unable to come to the reading room during library hours. The library was open daily from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. and on Sunday, until 10 p.m. The small library soon became \\"the center of liberal thought in Philadelphia\\"‚Äîa popular gathering place for Philadelphian reformers and socialists. In addition to the usual work of a special library, public and private lectures and classes were given to different associations. Besides being the chairwoman of the library committee, Marot was also on the lectures committee, which were all well attended, the rooms being, in fact, more than filled. The first lecture addressed the topic of \\"The Economics of Socialism.\\" It was given free on October 30, 1897 by James R. MacDonald of the London Fabian Society and future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. At the second meeting, on February 8, 1898, Professor Joseph French Johnson, Dr. Henry Rogers Seager, Charles Richardson, and Professor William I. Hull discussed and lectured on \\"Education in Economics.\\" On March 19, 1898 a lecture on \\"Economic Education, the Salvation of Society\\" was given by Dr. Daniel G. Brinton. Through her library, Helen Marot participated in educating Philadelphians to social changes and pursued the socialist cause for building a more just and humane society with perseverance, courage, and a combination of hardheaded realism and guileless romanticism. Labor and publishing work Six women including Mary Dreier, Ida Rauh, Helen Marot, Rena Borky, Yetta Raff, and Mary Effers link arms as they march to City Hall on December 3, 1909 during the New York shirtwaist strike to demand an end to abuse by police. In 1899 she published A Handbook of Labor Literature and also conducted and investigation for the U.S. Industrial Commission into working conditions in the custom tailoring trades in Philadelphia. In 1902 Marot investigated child labor in New York City for the Association of Neighborhood Workers and helped form the New York Child Labor Committee. With Florence Kelley and Josephine Clara Goldmark she drew up a report on child labor in the city that influential in the passage of the 1903 Compulsory Education Act by the state legislature.Nutter, K. (2010). Helen Marot. American National Biography. Available from: Gale Virtual Reference Library, Ipswich, MA. In 1906 Marot became executive secretary of the New York branch of the national Women's Trade Union League. Marot also was responsible for creating the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union of New York. She was the organizer and leader of the first great strike of shirtwaist makers and dressmakers (1909‚Äì10) under the banner of the new International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. In 1913, Marot resigned from her work with the trade union league. In 1914, she published American Labor Unions (1914), a work on the syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World. She then served on the editorial board of The Masses (1916‚Äì17), a radical journal. After, she then served on the staff of The Dial (1918‚Äì20). She was also a member of the U.S. Industrial Relations Commission (1914‚Äì16).

The treasury was acquired by the Canton of Basel in 1836 and shortly afterwards sold at auction to collectors and museums across Europe. The reliquary was later bought by the British Museum.British Museum Collection British Museum Highlights History For centuries the reliquary belonged to the cathedral treasury of Basel in Switzerland, where it was first recorded in 1477. It was sold, along with the rest of the treasury, in 1836, shortly after their acquisition by the canton of Basel. After passing through several owners, it was purchased by the British Museum in 1850. Description The main image shows the repouss√© silver-gilt cover of the reliquary modelled in the shape of the saint's head, which was made between 1180 and 1200 AD. It is adorned with a headband composed of glass and various precious stones. Around the base, twelve gold figures of the Apostles stand within arcading. Inside was a contemporary sycamore wooden case with a hollow compartment that held the relics of various saints and fragments of a skull that may have been from the head of Saint Eustace. The wooden head and relics were only discovered when the outer silver case was being cleaned in 1956. Relic Deposit From the ninth century, enshrining items which had once belonged to saints or church leaders, such as their bones or parts of their clothing, was an important feature of religious life in early medieval Europe. The reliquary could often be in the shape of a foot, arm, bell or even a domed building. In this case, the medieval silversmith had designed the relic deposit container in the shape of St. Eustace's head, who was an important Roman military saint. The image was designed to convey the sacredness and majesty of the saint to the pious faithful. Many of these luxury items were later melted down and destroyed during the reformation.
