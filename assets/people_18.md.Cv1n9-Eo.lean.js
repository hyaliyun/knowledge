Zaiyi himself created the unit in 1899, but it was decimated at the Battle of Peking in 1900 when the Eight-Nation Alliance captured Beijing to lift the Chinese siege of the foreign legations during the Boxer Uprising. Summary Hushenying has been translated variously as Tiger Spirit Division, Tiger and Divine Corps, and Tiger Spirit Battalion. Zaiyi, also known as Prince Duan, created the Hushenying in June 1899, for which he gained the praise of Empress Dowager Cixi. The new division contained 10,000 troops, all recruited from the banner armies that garrisoned the capital. Some Chinese sources claim that Zaiyi chose the name Hushenying to convey his dislike of foreigners ‚Äì since \\"tiger eats lamb (Yang, a pun on foreigners), and the divine tames the devil (Gui)\\" ‚Äì but this claim cannot be verified in the documents of the time. The Hushenying became the third modern army guarding Beijing, the other two being the Guards Army (established shortly before the Hushenying in 1899) and the older Peking Field Force (created in 1862). During the Boxer Uprising (1899‚Äì1901), the Hushenying was among the troops that besieged the Beijing Legation Quarter, where most foreigners lived. During that siege (summer 1900), the Hushenying led by the harshly anti-foreign Zaiyi often clashed with the Peking Field Force, which was commanded by the more moderate Yikuang (Prince Qing). Both armies were decimated in the Battle of Peking. Several Chinese works of fiction have been written about the Hushenying.

Background = Sec√ß√£o Sonora (in the 1950s)  In the 1950s there was a section dedicated to classical music broadcasting through the speakers of AEIST building. In his speech at the formal sitting celebrating the centenary of AEIST, M√°rio Lino, the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communication in the 17th Constitutional Government of Portugal, mentioned that he had taken part in activities of this section while a student in Instituto Superior T√©cnico.  R√°dio Universidade Tejo (1986-1988)  R√°dio Universidade Tejo (RUT) was a pirate station started in 1986, that initially broadcast from the AEIST building in 99.5 MHz, and afterwards in 100.7 MHz. It was closed in 1988.  RIIST (1995-2000)  In 1995 a group of students at the AEIST, created a new campus radio named of R√°dio Interna do IST/RIIST (IST Internal Radio), transmitting only through speakers installed in the campus. By the academic season of 1999 / 2000 it became an internet stream as well. This group disappeared in 2000.  Reactivation = RIIST (2004-2006)  In May 2002, a group of students of IST, composed by Alexandre Rio, Andr√© Duarte, Andr√© Santos, Bartolomeu Bernardes, Bernardo Mendes, David Santos, ricochete.org. Acedido em 2012-03-02. Edgar Lopes, Joana Batista, Jo√£o Aguiar, Jo√£o Pina, Ricardo Ramires, Ricardo Ressurei√ß√£o and Tiago Carvalho, decided to reactivate the extinct RIIST. Some of them ran for the administration of the student's union AEIST (cultural and creative section), whereas others were non-official supporters of the other candidates. Despite not being elected, the whole group decided in that same September to start the procedures to reopen RIIST. In 2003 several students recovered the radio section. The broadcast restarted on April 26, 2004. In 2005, during the Transmediale in Berlin, the RIIST co-founded and presented along with nine other radio stations (Resonance FM, UK; Bootlab, Germany; Tilos Radio, Hungary; Radio Campus, Belgium; Kunstradio, Austria; Orange, Austria; Radio Cult, Bulgaria; Kanal103, Macedonia; and Oxygen, Albania) the radio network Radia.

In addition, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) continued a separate investigation of the prison system related to PREA audits, and another section investigated corruption among officials and contractors for the Mississippi prison system. In November 2014, Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Christopher Epps resigned a day before he was indicted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on corruption charges for bribery and taking kickbacks. Commissioner since 2002, he was known for reducing the use of solitary confinement in state prisons, and reducing prison populations after supporting passage of a 2009 bill allowing earlier parole for non-violent offenders with a low risk of recidivism. Cecil McCrory, a business man and former state legislator, was indicted for bribing Epps in return for having prison-services contracts steered to him and his clients. He had worked as a consultant for MTC, GEO Group, and Cornell Companies, all of which had operated private prisons in Mississippi. By November 2015 both men had pleaded guilty and were cooperating with law enforcement in the investigation. A third man also pleaded guilty. The trial of another former state lawmaker, Irb Benjamin, was scheduled for January 2016. Numerous other people were convicted in this case and prosecutions were continuing in 2017. In February 2017 the Mississippi Attorney General announced civil suits seeking damages and punitive damages from 15 contractors and several individuals who had contracts during this period awarded under Epps and associated with prison operations.

Forewings light green ; costal edge whitish - ochreous ; first line faint, curved ; second nearly straight, whitish ; cilia white, basal half pale greenish. Hindwings as forewings, but first line absent; termen very obtusely angulated. Larva pale green, with purplish dorsal sometimes connected marks ; subdorsal line whitish ; lateral ridge pale yellow ; head purplish.Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf The wingspan is 24‚Äì27 mm. Biology The larvae feed on Calluna vulgaris, Betula and Salix species (including Salix repens). Other recorded food plants include Empetrum nigrum, Myrica gale, Vaccinium uliginosum, Quercus, Potentilla, Galium, Hieracium, Artemisia, Ononis, Clematis, Prunus, Crataegus, Corylus, Rubus, Erica, Ulex, Genista, Lotus corniculatus, Crataegus and Ledum palustre. Larvae can be found from July to August. The species overwinters as a pupa. Etymology The scientific name viridata refers to the green colour of the wings (viridis means green).

It branches from the East Coast Main Trunk at a triangle junction outside Baypark Stadium before running north-west through Mount Maunganui to the port complex. A number of services use the branch daily. Its primary traffic is bulk products - export timber and some timber products from local forests and the Kinlieth and Tasman mills; and coal destined for the Huntly power station and the New Zealand Steel mill at Glenbrook. It is also used for shunts to and from the container handling facilities of the Port of Tauranga, which are located at Sulphur Point on the other side of Tauranga Harbour. With 21 freight trains per day the line was estimated (1990) as the fifth busiest line in New Zealand.  History  By 1910 the Mount Maunganui wharf was used by the Public Works Department (PWD) with workshops for railway construction material in the area, so was not handed over to the NZR until 1924. With the Great Depression the PWD workshop was closed about 1930, and the branch had no regular traffic from 1934. In 1942 because of a shortage of track material the track was lifted and relaid to the nearby RNZAF base (now Tauranga Airport). With the establishment of the Kawerau Branch the port was to be used for exporting paper and timber. The line was relaid with heavy rails and reopened on 28 March 1955. In the 1950s a large marshalling yard was built at Mount Maunganui and extended in the 1960s and 1970s. A new marshalling yard had been built at Te Maunga the junction with the East Coast Main Trunk (ECMT), but more recently most trains run into Mount Maunganui and the line is operated as part of the ECMT. The Frankton Junction picnic train for Railways staff from Hamilton to Mount Maunganui used to be a very significant event. In the 1970s and 1980s there was consideration to a combined road and rail bridge across the Tauranga Harbour to shorten the distance from Tauranga to the port, but as a low-level bridge would affect shipping a high-level bridge was built; the steep approach grades precluded its use by rail. There was local pressure in the 1970s to reroute the branch line, and before the 1972 general election Sir Basil Arthur the Labour spokesman on transport had promised to reroute the line if Labour was elected.Bay of Plenty Times, 15 November 1972 But the deviation did not proceed. It would have cost $3 million (1974), with extra operating costs of $3000 per year. The new route would have required sharp curves and a level crossing.Bay of Plenty Times, 10 November 1973 & 2 July 1974 In 2016, the junction with the East Coast Main Trunk was relocated westward and the line diverted west of Owens Place. The diversion was to allow room for State Highway 2 to be widened and grade separated between Bayfair and Baypark.

Berlin was the first chemist who took the initiative to write a textbook on elementary science, the purpose being to provide basic science education for the general public. His chemistry research emphasized the study of minerals, especially the newly-discovered rare earths, having devised means of separating yttrium and erbium. The mineral berlinite (a type of aluminium phosphate) is named after him. Berlin became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1844. Education Berlin graduated from the University of Uppsala with a doctor of philosophy in 1833, having studied under the tutelage of J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius. He completed a doctor of medicine degree in 1837, also at the University of Uppsala. Academic career Berlin held a number of faculty positions at the University of Lund, beginning in 1843 as a professor of pharmacology. Subsequently he also became a professor of chemistry and mineralogy in 1847, then rector of the university, 1854-1855, and lastly professor of medical and physiological chemistry in 1862. He served as the Director of the National Board of Hygiene (Sundhetskollegiet) beginning in 1864. Elementary science textbooks Berlin was the first chemist to write a textbook for elementary science for the general population. Berlin published two popular textbooks, which emphasized description and practical knowledge over theory (of which there was relatively little at the time). Vext-chemien i sammandrag was published in 1835, and Elementar-l√§robok i oorganisk kemi first appeared in 1857. It went through 15 editions, selling more than 450,000 copies. His textbooks helped to catalyze the teaching of science in elementary schools. They received praise and an award from the Swedish parliament, and were translated into German and Finnish. The third edition of Berlin's textbook, which appeared in 1870, was heavily revised by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, who added his own systematization of the elements. Berlin's father was a vicar. Berlin himself stated in his will that \\"Science and the thorough testing of its problems and results has never given me reason to doubt the truths of religion\\". As a scientist, and as a popularizer of science, Berlin situated scientific knowledge securely on a religious basis. This may have been an advantage when selling elementary science textbooks, since pastors often led the local school boards that chose the textbooks for their schools. Research on rare earth elements In 1787 Carl Axel Arrhenius found a dark mineral in a feldspar mine in the village of Ytterby, Sweden. He sent a sample of this ytterbite to Johan Gadolin for further analysis. A number of researchers tried to identify elements composing the ore, which were particularly hard to separate due to their similar chemical properties. As a group, they were given the misnomer rare-earth elements. (In fact, they are not rare, just difficult to extract.) Individually, they were discovered and named by various scientists, often using variants based on the word \\"Ytterby\\". The first two ores to be derived were called ceria and yttria. In the 1830s and 40s, Carl Gustav Mosander derived several substances from these known ores. In 1843 Mosander was able to extract three metal oxides from ytteria, a whitish \\"earth\\" which he called pure ytteria, a pink or rose-colored oxide which he called terbia, and a yellowish peroxide which he called erbia. Mosander was rightfully uncertain of their purity; they did however contain the elements yttrium, erbium, and terbium. Like scientists before him such as Mosander and Arrhenius, Berlin also worked on separation of ytteria ore into its constituent compounds. In 1860, Berlin successfully reported the identification of two substances, yttrium, and a pink salt which Berlin named erbium. Subsequent chemists followed Berlin's designation rather than Mosander's. The naming of ytteria's components became further complicated in 1862, when Marc Delafontaine reported its separation into yttrium and a yellow peroxide, which he first called mosandrum (after Mosander) and later terbium. In this way, the names originally given to erbium and terbium became switched.

Laycock CEC discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell CEC. The Navy Lighterage pontoon (NLP) was a type of pontoon developed in World War II by Capt. John N. Laycock Civil Engineer Corps(CEC) and used by Naval Construction Battalions(Seabees) on invasion beaches and shallow harbors or harbors where the facilities had been destroyed or did not exist. It was referred to as the Seabee's \\"magic box\\". It was Lego-like system of pre-cut pre-drilled angle iron and steel plate. It was first assembled into individual boxes that were joined in multiples to construct docks, causeways, barges, dry docks, floating cranes, marine railways or whatever was needed. Capt. Carl A. Carlson CEC of the War Plans Office came up with the concept of NLPs in 1935,Captain John N. Laycock , NHHC, U.S.Navy Seabee Museum website, Feb. 2020, Port Hueneme, CA but it was in 1940 that the US Navy looked at the idea more seriously. Development, with testing, began just before the US entered World War II. The Dieppe Raid in early 1942 showed that the idea of seizing a port in the face of modern coastal defences was either costly or impossible. The US Navy saw the vital importance of being able to build their own port facilities and to deploy naval construction units trained and dedicated for just that role. Creating the Seabees addressed that issue. Four battalions were tasked as pontoon battalions and five Pontoon Assembly Detachments (PADs) were formed. The US Army soon followed with their own units. The Navy Pontoon gets far too little credit for its critical role in WWII. It opened up many new avenues of attack as 2 x 175 foot section carried on sides of LST's could land on shallow water beaches. They were assembled to form an easy to get to theater dry dock for up to LST side (with section vertically on the sides to form the walls of a dry dock.) They had piping inside to blow out and or sink as needed. They formed the basis for cranes. Knocked down they could be shipped rapidly to any area needed and assmeld as needed. Barges: With its own Drive System (not add on) , pontoon in whatever length and width needed, and you had an unsinkable barge (many compartments and locked together). Need to repair one? Grab pieces from a knocked down pontoon or cut one up. Seabees could not do their job until they had a Dozer ashore, Pontoon run in front of a LCT or LST or carry from offshore and they could do their wonders. The Seabee's emblem should be a Dozer in one hand and a Pontoon in the other and Nothing Stops US. It was as important as a Sherman as its what got the fuel and ammo ashore. Construction The NLPs were constructed of welded steel flotation units that were assembled like Legos, connected by special angle-iron pieces, called stringers. The flotation boxes and stringers were held together by special iron wedge pins. The flotation boxes came in two types: a rectangular basic unit measuring . The majority of NLPs were constructed using these. The second type had one side that was curved or angled to make a bow on the front of NLP barges or a ramp as needed.

Best known for his large paintings depicting historical scenes, and his series of colourful landscapes and seascapes of his native Dalmatia, Medoviƒá is one of the earliest modern Croatian painters. In his youth Medoviƒá was schooled to become a priest in the Franciscan Seminary in Dubrovnik, and was ordained in 1874, taking the name of Celestin. He received his first art training in Italy, and went on to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he began painting artistic impressions of historical events. Following graduation he decided to leave the church and pursue his painting career. Medoviƒá then moved to Zagreb and joined a group of artists led by Vlaho Bukovac, a renowned painter. His work from this period includes historical depictions at the building of the Croatian Institute of History (). Since 1901 Medoviƒá increasingly began to spend time on his native Pelje≈°ac in southern Croatia, painting nature, still lifes, seascapes and landscapes in a style marked by his use of colour and light shadows. Biography Mato Medoviƒá was born on 17 November 1857 in Kuna on the Pelje≈°ac peninsula into a peasant family. Young Mato got his first education at a nearby Franciscan monastery dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto (Delorita). In 1868, at the age of 11 he joined the Franciscan seminary in Dubrovnik, where he took his vows in 1874, taking the name of Celestin. The artistic talent of the young monk was noticed by Abbot Portoguaro Bernardino, on a visit from Rome. So in 1880, Medoviƒá was placed in the monastery of St Isidoro in Rome, known for its Nazarene painters. He was assigned to Lodovico Seitz, an influential artist who painted the frescoes in the Cathedral of ƒêakovo. However, the rigid and outdated artistic style did not suit Medoviƒá, and he looked for a different teacher in Giuseppe Grandi, then in the private school of Antonio Ciseri in Florence. Arrival of the Croats () by Mato Celestin Medoviƒá In 1886, the Franciscan order sent him back to Dubrovnik. However, at the urging of the painter Emil Jakob Schindler, he was sent to continue his studies at the Academy of Arts in Munich. There Medoviƒá studied historical genre paintings, particularly the work of Karl von Piloty. He composed large canvases of historical scenes, winning a silver medal in 1893 for his final diploma work \\"Bacchanal\\" (), and successfully exhibited his work in several European cities. On his return to Dubrovnik in 1893, there seemed no possibility for further artistic progress. Dr Franjo Raƒçki (a founder member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) and Dr Iso Kr≈°njav (head of the Department of Culture ()) invited him to Zagreb to join the group of artists around Vlaho Bukovac, a Dubrovnik artist who had recently left Paris and settled in Zagreb. So in 1895 Medoviƒá left the Franciscan order and set up a studio in Zagreb. During his stay there (1895‚Äì1907) he painted many religious works in northern Croatian churches (Kri≈æevci, Po≈æega, Nova Gradi≈°ka) and historical compositions based on Croatian history, most notably those in the Golden Hall () of the Institute of History in Zagreb. Medoviƒá also painted a series of portraits of Zagreb people using fragmented lines, soft contours and vibrant colours. In 1898, Medoviƒá had a house and studio built in Kuna, and a villa on the coast at Crkvice. He began to spend increasing amounts of time there, painting nature. In 1901, he held a group exhibit with Oton Ivekoviƒá, in which he presented his entire Zagreb works. Until 1907 Medoviƒá was kept busy with government works in Zagreb and exhibited with other Croatian artists in Budapest, Copenhagen, Paris, Prague, Belgrade, Sofia and Zagreb. After 1908, Medoviƒá gave up his Zagreb studio entirely and remained on the Pelje≈°ac peninsula, living alone and painting. His subjects were taken from the nature around him, still lifes of fruit and fish, seascapes, and landscapes, filled with colour, light and soft shadows. His seascapes are studies of light playing on the open sea, breaking waves or a moonlit night. After a few years Medoviƒá grew tired of the isolation from other artists, and for a short time worked in Vienna (1912‚Äì1914). In 1914 he held an exhibition, where he sold all his paintings. At the start of the First World War he again went back to Kuna where the harsh living conditions took their toll on his health. By the end of the war Medoviƒá was suffering from renal disease and in late December 1919 he sought help at a hospital in Sarajevo, but too late. He died on 20 January 1920, and was laid to rest in the cemetery in Kuna. Legacy \\"The Coronation of King Ladislas\\" () by Mato Celestin Medoviƒá Medoviƒá's time in Italy did not leave a lasting impression his work. His paintings from the time can be found in a few Franciscan monasteries, for example Fucecchio, Faenza, and Cesena. His years spent at the Academy of Art in Munich (1888‚Äì1893) were more formative. There he adopted the style and neutral colors typical of the late 19th century. Some very well preserved portraits (\\"Mother\\" (), \\"Old Fisherman\\" (), \\"Portrait of an old man\\" ()) are impressive studies of elderly people. A few paintings of saints, for example \\"St. Bonaventura\\", painted during this period, all reveal a high quality realistic interpretation. During his time in Zagreb (1895‚Äì1907), Medoviƒá gradually absorbed some of Bukovac's techniques and brighter colours into his own artistic personality. His large historical compositions, \\"Srijemski Martyr\\" ()\\", \\"Split Parliament\\" (), \\"Arrival of the Croats\\" (), \\"Betrothal of King Zvonimir\\" (), and \\"The Coronation of King Ladislas\\" () demonstrate Medoviƒá's eye for detail and his skillful interpretation of the subject. Portraits from this time include the expressive \\"St. Francis\\", and some drawings and paintings of the people of Zagreb. Medoviƒá's work on the Pelje≈°ac peninsula marked a complete departure in technique and themes. He painted still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes, which were new genres in Croatian art at the time. His palette became lighter and brighter as he worked outdoors: browns, greys and dull greens became purer, and were joined the purple of heather, the yellow of broom, and the rich array of blues of the sea. Abandoning his previously detailed style, his smaller studies from nature are more creative. With thick impasto and impulsive brush strokes, around 1907 a new style emerged in his work ‚Äì pointillism in a light, bright colours, that he used for his landscapes of Pelje≈°ac. Initially (1908‚Äì1912), these were disciplined strokes on larger canvases, but in his later (1914‚Äì1918), smaller paintings with impressionistically captured motifs, the strokes became softer and more diffuse colours. He was one of the first Croatian artists to paint the coastal landscapes, and it dominated his work after the turn of the century. Medoviƒá was a versatile artist, among the first generation of modern Croatian painters. He was the leader in historical and religious paintings (from intimate images of saints to altarpieces such as those on the island of Pa≈°man, the town of Ba≈°ka on the island of Krk, and Vrboska on the island of Hvar). He painted some fine portraits, and Medoviƒá was the only Croatian artist in this period painting still lifes. However, his major contribution to Croatian painting is his series of landscapes, full of bright southern light and vigorous colours. His hometown of Kuna now hosts an art colony, and art gallery in his name - KUD Mato Celestin Medoviƒá. Medovic's painting of \\"Pelje≈°ko - korƒçulanski kanal\\", 1908-1912 appeared on a Croatian Post Office stamp in 1996.

The attack was carried out by a disgruntled former employee of Connellan Airways (also known as Connair), who flew a Beechcraft Baron into the Connair complex at the airport. The attack killed the pilot and four other people and injured four more, two of them seriously. The disaster is one of only two aircraft suicide attacks in Australia's history, the other being in 1982 at Bankstown Airport. Background The perpetrator, Colin Richard Forman, was 23 years old at the time of the attack. He had migrated from the United Kingdom to Australia alone in the mid 1960s, but had trouble adjusting and, in 1974, tried to forge a Qantas ticket back to England. The forged ticket was detected and Forman had a conviction recorded against him. In November 1975, Forman obtained a commercial pilot's licence, and he started flying for Connair in January 1976. The ticket forgery soon came to light and Forman was dismissed after seven weeks. He then found another job at Ord Air Charter in Wyndham, but was soon fired from there as well. Forman apparently believed that Roger Connellan, his boss at Connair, had informed Ord Air about his forgery conviction. In late 1976, Forman was living in Mount Isa, Queensland, eking out a living flying occasional single-engine (Cessna) charter flights for freight and tourists and where he was a member of the Mount Isa Aero Club. In about October 1976, he told a fellow member and local North West Star journalist \\"If I don't get a job by Christmas then you will get to know and through you most of the world will know\\". He attended the aero club's 76/77 New Year's Eve party. Attack Early on the morning of 3 January 1977, Forman trashed his one-bedroom flat in Mount Isa, piled up the remnants in a corner of his lounge room and created what was later described as an altar. On the top was a trophy for topping his course (Blue Flight) at the former Cessnock, New South Wales Nationwide Aviation Space Academy, and in front of the trophy was his pilot's log book, laid open. On the date of his sacking from Connair, an entry read: \\"Sentenced to death this date\\", and the final page of his log book contained the date, aircraft type, call sign, destination and \\"Suicide Mission\\". The final words were THE END on the left and right pages respectively.Personal account PC SMITH Mount Isa journalist who was first to enter Foreman's flat and found and photographed the scene Forman then drove 2,000 km (1200 miles) to Wyndham, stopping overnight at Katherine. On 5 January he stole a Beechcraft 58 Baron (Aircraft registration VH-ENA) from Wyndham Airport after discovering the larger aircraft he had wanted to use was being used by the Royal Flying Doctor Service that day. Alice Springs is four hours flying time from Wyndham in a Beechcraft Baron: Forman had planned to strike at 10 am during the company's morning break, but he did not account for the time difference between Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and arrived at 11 am. As he reached the airfield at Alice Springs, he broadcast a final message by radio: \\"It is better to die with honour than live without it ‚Äì Echo ‚Äì November ‚Äì Alpha.\\" Forman then set full power on both engines and aimed at the Connellan complex before plunging the aircraft into the centre of the building. Four people were killed on impact, including Forman's former manager Roger Connellan.http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/tragedy/display/103203-roger- connellan A secretary was badly burned and died of her injuries in hospital five days later. Four other Connair employees were injured. Aftermath During the investigation, letters addressed to the Department of Transport were found which explained his motivations. In them he related his court appearance, described his seven weeks working at Connair as the happiest in his life, and his employment issues following dismissal. He also detailed his plan and his aim to \\"cause Connair the maximum amount of loss and hardship\\" and \\"to kill and maim as many employees of Connair Pty Ltd as possible\\". This latter comment was erroneously attributed to the final entry in his log book by some media outlets. Connellan Airways was sold to East-West Airlines in 1980.

It has up to seven narrow egg- shaped leaves and up to thirty small green and white flowers crowded along a fleshy, hairy flowering stem. It mainly grows in wet forest and rainforest.  Description  Zeuxine oblonga is a terrestrial, tuberous, perennial herb. It has between three and seven dark green, narrow egg-shaped leaves, long and wide which form a loose rosette. Between five and thirty resupinate, dull green and white flowers, about long and wide are crowded on a fleshy, hairy, pinkish flowering stem tall. The outside surface of the flowers is hairy. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide and overlaps the petals forming a hood over the column. The dorsal sepal is green with pink edges, the lateral sepals are green and the petals are white. The lateral sepals and petals are about long and wide with the lateral sepals spreading apart from each other. The labellum is white, about long, wide with two lobes on the end. Flowering occurs from July to September. Taxonomy and naming Zeuxine oblonga was first formally described in 1920 by Richard Sanders Rogers and Cyril Tenison White and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The specific epithet (oblonga) is a Latin word meaning \\"longer than broad\\".  Distribution and habitat  The common jewel orchid is endemic to northern Australia and has been recorded from the far north-east of Western Australia, between the Keep and Adelaide Rivers in the Northern Territory and from the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland to Coffs Harbour in New South Wales. It usually grows in colonies on dark, moist sites on the rainforest floor, and is locally common in swampy areas with peaty soils next to streams.  Conservation  In the Northern Territory Z. oblonga is listed as Vulnerable because there it has an estimated population size of fewer than 1000 individual plants, and an estimated area of occurrence of less than in the territory. Potential threats include feral animal disturbance, changes to hydrology and horticultural harvesting. In Western Australia the species is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

The host plants for the species include Nothopanax arboreum, Nothopanax simplex, and Nothopanax sinclairii. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The larva, on hatching, at once mines into the leaf through the shell of the egg, and as a general rule takes several spiral turns before mining in any definite direction. The mine throughout is a very gradually widening gallery, never becoming blotched, and rarely do portions cross each other except in the smaller leaves. Its direction invariably takes it along both sides of the midrib, this obstacle being crossed in its upper and thinner part. From these long straight portions a varying number of blind arms or branches of varying lengths, mostly straight but sometimes slightly curved, sprout out into the leaf. As a rule the greater number will be confined to one half of the leaf. These blind branches sometimes follow the course of the veins of the leaf, but most often do not, generally treating these as no obstacle. They do not often reach as far as the outer margin of the leaf, but may do so, and may follow it a short distance. These branches are all more or less parallel to one another, and rarely cross. The mine is found only in the younger leaves, and is pale green in colour, the tips of the branches often being white, showing where the larva came close against the upper cuticle. Old mines become white, but otherwise do not discolour the leaf. The frass is very finely granular.

Desakota areas typically occur in Asia, especially South East Asia. Examples can be found in the urbanised regions of Java, the densely populated, delta-shaped areas on the peripheries of the Jakarta agglomeration (\\"Jabodetabek\\"), but also the extended metropolitan regions of Bangkok or Manila. Outside South East Asia, areas with comparable features have been described in mainland China, India, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.  Characteristics  Desakota areas are situated outside the periurban zones, from which daily commuting is easily possible, i.e. more than 30 or 50 km (18 or 30 miles) off the city centre. They often sprawl alongside arterial and communication roads, sometimes from one agglomeration to the next. They are characterised by high population density and intensive agricultural use (especially wet-rice cultivation), but differ from densely populated rural areas by more urban-like characteristics. These criteria are: developed transport networks, high population mobility, increasing activity outside the agricultural sector, the coexistence of many different forms of land use, more female participation in paid labour, and unregulated land use. Given their rambling extent and indistinct boundaries, the emergence of Desakota regions brings difficulties for the administration, as uniform plans, regulations or designs are hardly viable. Desakota regions are characterised by high mobility of goods and services and rapid change in patterns of settlement. They usually elude the division in functionally specialised zones that is conventionally applied in urban geography. Completely different forms of use, as e.g. traditional agriculture, large scale and cottage industry, amusement parks and golf courses, shopping centres and retail parks, and forms of settlement from shanty towns to gated community coexist in them close to each other.

Infection in oysters rarely results in clinical signs of disease and often the only indication of the infection is increased mortality.Scottish Fish Health Inspectorate The Australian flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, has been infected with two similar Bonamia parasites, Bonamia exitiosa and B. roughleyi. Pathology The cells of Bonamia ostreae measure 2-3 ¬µm in diameter and are found within the haemocytes of the oyster. Lesions occur with focal infiltration of the haemocytes within the connective tissue of the mantle and gills, and in the vascular sinuses near the digestive gland, intestine and stomach. Infection seems to be correlated to haemocyte destruction and diapedesis. Epidemiology A study in the Netherlands of the epidemiology of European flat oysters, Ostrea edulis, infected with Bonamia ostreae showed that the parasite was present throughout the year and was detected in all oyster weight classes. The study analyzed the prevalence relative to O. edulis density, biomass and a range of environmental parameters. Prevalence was greatest in the largest oysters and was higher in spring than in the autumn, perhaps because of the mortality of these shellfish during the summer. Mortality seemed to be correlated with higher water temperatures and oysters seemed to be more susceptible to infection after seasons with lower food availability or lower salinity levels. Distribution In Europe, distribution of the parasite is along the Atlantic coast from Spain to Denmark. In the USA it is found on the Atlantic coast in Maine and the Pacific coast from California to Washington. Research A study was made in 2001 into the relative susceptibility of different strains of Ostrea edulis to the parasite Bonamia ostreae. Another study was made in 2004 into the incidence of infection by Bonamia ostrea in different populations of Ostrea edulis. A study made in 2010 aimed to evaluate the Bonamia spp. infection status of Ostrea stentina in the Mediterranean Sea. A further study made in 2010 investigated whether the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, could act as a carrier or a reservoir of Bonamia ostreae and transmit the infection to Ostrea edulis.

On the basis of the targets set by the Alpine Convention, its members, together with their citizens, work to develop their alpine living environment in a sustainable way. ‚ÄúExchange ‚Äì Address ‚Äì Implement‚Äù is the guiding principle behind the Alliance‚Äôs activities. The network of communities offers a sharing of experience and information beyond the boundaries of language and culture. All the publications and events are in four languages: German, French, Italian and Slovene. Activities The network ¬´ Alliance in the Alps ¬ª promotes the exchange of knowledge and experience, threw setting up events and excursions at local, regional or international level. It also plans to formulate policy positions for a sustainable and environmentally approach to climate change by municipalities. The annual report is published in the four main languages of the alpine space, and a newsletter \\"Flashinfo\\" is sent by email quarterly. Members The network is currently counting 316 municipalities members in seven countries: Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovenia, Switzerland . A membership requires the assent to the principles and goals of the Alpine Convention. Afterwards, the members also have to implement sustainable goals, to develop measure programs protecting the environment, and to constantly improve the environmental protection. Projects=dynAlp-climate  130px Climate changes are currently the focus of many actors. Unfortunately the measures adopted in some cases disagree with the principle of sustainable development and are opposite to nature conservation. That‚Äôs why the network of municipalities believes it is so important to support its members in embracing a sustainable approach to the problem of climate change. Focussing on climate changes, the new dynAlp- climate program is running from 2009 to 2012. It has a budget of around 800,000 euros, due to the financial support from the MAVA Foundation for Nature. The financial assistance is intended for projects in municipalities or regions which are providing a contribution to climate protection and adaptation to climate change impacts. In parallel with the municipal projects, group events such as workshops, excursions and international meetings are a key activity of dynAlp-climate as well. These help to increase networking between the alpine municipalities and thus help to make local knowledge accessible to a large public. DYNALP2 With the DYNALP¬≤ project (2006‚Äì2009), \\"Alliance in the Alps\\" carried on the work on sustainable development and implementation of the Alpine Convention. DYNALP¬≤ implements the findings from CIPRA‚Äôs Future in the Alps Project\\" at the community level and promotes exchanges between the municipalities. DYNALP¬≤ projects focus on one or more of the following topic areas: regional added value, governance capacity, protected areas, mobility, new forms of decision making, and policies and instruments. DYNALP 130px Launched in 2003, DYNALP was an INTERREG IIIB ‚ÄúAlpine space‚Äù project supported by the EU. With a total budget of 2.16 million euros for a period of three years, it helped to fund the development, coordination and implementation of 52 community or regional projects for the following four protocols of the Alpine Convention: Tourism, Conservation of Nature and the Countryside, Mountain Farming and Regional Planning and Sustainable Development. In addition to projects in communes, sharing experiences across borders language and culture was the most important goal of DYNALP. Coop√©ration The ‚ÄúAlliance of Central Asian Mountain Communities‚Äù was founded in June 2003 in the Tadjik capital Dushanbe on the model of the \\"Alliance in the Alps\\" network. Like its sister organisation in the Alps, this Central Asian community network is active in the area of sustainable development in mountain communities and knowledge-sharing at the community level.

These cyclones occur almost every year in Bangladesh though their intensity varies from year to year. *Tornadoes are fairly common in Bangladesh as it is one of the most frequently hit countries in the world, behind the United States and Canada. Impact of climate change Climate change has forced many people of Bangladesh living in rural areas to migrate to cities that has caused a sharp rise in the slum population of Dhaka. As Bangladesh is already less than 20 feet above sea level, thus there are fears that by the end of the 21st century, more than a quarter of the country will be inundated and 15 million people will be displaced. The population of Dhaka, currently 13 million people, is projected to increase to 20 million by the year 2025. This raises fears of water-borne diseases and outbreaks of several other diseases.

His father was William Taylor, an English or Scottish mercenary, who changed his name to Teyler.Dutch Who's Who for Johannes Teyler Johan studied Latin at the Latin school of Nijmegen and Mathematics at the Kwartierlijke Academie, where he wrote a dissertation in favor of Descartes. After the death of his father, he studied in Leiden and afterwards acquired a post as Professor of Math and Philosophy in Nijmegen in 1670. He was a respected professor but was overlooked for promotion due to his Cartesian ideas. Through the mediation of his friend Gottfried Leibniz he attempted to acquire a professorship in Wolfenb√ºttel but gave up after discussions with Christiaan Huygens. The rest of his career was outside Academia. In 1676 he became Vestingbouwkundige fortication manager for Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg during the Scanian War. In 1678 he also became tutor for the Elector's sons. Later the same year he was dismissed and returned to Nijmegen to receive backpay which was still owed him there. With the extra funds he undertook a trip to Italy, Egypt, the Holy Land and Malta, and later sent his diary to the Elector. He later wrote a popular book on fortifications in 1688 called Architectura militaris (Rotterdam, 1688), and in the same year received a patent on a color printing process that involved using different colors of ink at the same time when printing plates. In 1695 he had a printing workshop in Rijswijk where he printed military-related works, but in 1697 he sold it and in 1698 undertook another trip to Berlin. According to Houbraken he was a friend of Jacob de Heusch and a colleague in the Bentvueghels with the nickname Speculatie, who travelled with De Heusch to Berlin in 1698. Joh.

Keir House is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History The Keir estate was acquired by the Stirling family in 1448, and a house was built on it in the 16th century. The Stirlings supported the Jacobites during the 18th-century rebellions, and the estate was forfeited. However, they continued to live at Keir, and built the present house in around 1760. Income from the family's estates in Jamaica funded agricultural improvements and landscaping of the grounds. Additions were made to the house, including the south-west wing to designs by David Hamilton, completed in 1831. In 1847 Sir William Stirling Maxwell inherited the estate, and began a remodelling of the house and grounds. Architects Alfred Jenoure and William Stirling II worked on the house, while formal gardens were laid out by James Niven. A chapel was added in 1912, designed by Rowand Anderson and Paul, and with interior mosaic decoration by Boris Anrep. Sir William's grandson David Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service, was born at Keir in 1915. In 1975 the house, together with , was sold by the Stirling family for ¬£2 million to Mahdi Al Tajir, a businessman from the United Arab Emirates. The estate The estate is entered from the north-east via the New Lodge. Built in 1820 to Greek Revival designs by David Hamilton, this was originally the South Lodge, but was moved to its present location in 1969 when the M9 motorway was built through the eastern edge of the grounds. The Home Farm was built in 1832 and designed by David Bryce, but was elaborated by Sir William Stirling-Maxwell around 1858. The large steading includes a clock tower and a dairy with pictorial tiles.

It is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Civita Castellana. History The edifice was built from around 1185, over a pre-existing church, and was completed with the construction of the portico in 1210. The latter saw the intervention of the Roman Cosmati family of architects and marble workers. After centuries of decay, in the 18th century the church was totally restored and the interior was renovated in Baroque style. The two aisles were turned into side chapels, communicating with each other, thus keeping only a single nave. A plaque on the building's exterior commemorates Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's sojourn in Civita Castellana on 17 July 1770: he also played the cathedral's organ in the Sunday mass of that day. Description=Exterior The church is preceded by a 13th-century portico, in whose architrave was once a mosaic frieze with gilded letters. Today only a few fragments of the latter can be seen. Two central piers support a rounded arch, in which is the writing ‚ÄúGloria in excelsis Deo‚Ä¶‚Äù, while another inscription at the top contains the name of the portico's designer, \\"IACOBUS CIVIS ROMANUS\\" (\\"James, citizen of Rome\\") and the date of execution (1210). The central and final piers of the portico are decorated with the marble symbols of the Four Evangelists, while in the middle of the arch is a lamb, symbolizing Jesus Christ. The cathedral has three entrance gates. The central one is sided by four Corinthian columns, two of which stand on marble lions. Under the right lion is the representation of a child, a symbol of the faithful entering the church. The lunettes over the side gates have Cosmatesque mosaic decorations; the right lunette has also the representation of the \\"Blessing Christ\\". The cathedral has a Romanesque bell tower. The high altar Interior The church has a single nave, with side chapels which communicate with each other. The nave ends in a transept which precedes the raised presbytery, under which is the crypt. In the transept's arms are two monumental Baroque altars: the right one is dedicated to the Madonna of the Light, and incorporates an 11th-century fresco; the left-hand altar is dedicated to the Madonna of the Rosary, and has a 16th-century canvas surrounded by 15 panels, depicting the mystery of the rosary. One of the two 13th century parapets walled in the crypt The presbytery is home to one of the most precious works of art in the church, the high altar. It consists of a 4th-century Roman-Palaeochristian sarcophagus with seven niches which are decorated by biblical episodes. At the end of the presbytery, over the wooden choir, is a canvas by Pietro Nelli (Annunciation), while at the sides are two frescoes of the Resurrection of John and the Martyrdom of Sts. John and Marcianus. A door on the left side of the presbytery leads to the oratory of Mary's Heart, built as a chapel in the 14th century. This houses important medieval works including: *several 12th-century frescoes depicting a Madonna with Saints, an Angel and other Saints *the front section of an early Middle Ages (9th-century) sarcophagus with representations of hunting scenes *two Cosmatesque parapets flanked by two lions, originally in the cathedral's presbytery, dated to c. 1231-1240. Under the presbytery is the crypt, with cross-vaults, dating to the 12th century but renewed later. It houses two Renaissance marble cyboria, originally in the presbytery but walled here during the 18th-century renovation works.

In May 2009 he became the 16th person, and the first German, to climb the 14 eight- thousanders. Early life Dujmovits was born in 1961 in B√ºhl, Baden- W√ºrttemberg. After completing his Abitur (final school exams) in 1981 he spent a year traveling around South America and climbing in the Andes before commencing his degree in medicine at the University of Heidelberg. He left the university after eight semesters and in 1985 began his training to become a certified mountain guide instead. Career Dujmovits' mountaineering career began with the German Alpine Club, where he worked as a guide and led clients on international expeditions including highest mountains on six of the seven continents. He also climbed extensively in the Alps, with and without clients, making successful ascents of the Matterhorn, the Eiger, Mont Blanc, the Grosshorn, Les Courtes, Laliderer, the Reissend Nollen, and peaks in the Engelhorn Range. In 1989, he left the German Alpine Club to start up his own trekking outfitter, Amical Alpin. Dujmovits began climbing in the Himalaya and Karakorum in the 1990s, starting with successful ascents of Dhaulagiri I (1990), Mount Everest (1992), K2 (1994), Cho Oyu (1995), and Shisha Pangma (1997). He began to attract attention from the wider public in 1999, when his climb of the Eiger's north wall in Switzerland was publicized as a 33-hour- long live television broadcast. Dujmovits went on to summit Broad Peak (1999) and Gasherbrum II (2000), but it was not until he climbed Nanga Parbat in 2001 that he decided to attempt to climb all fourteen mountains in the world higher than 8000 metres (\\"eight-thousanders\\"). In 2004, he climbed Annapurna I and Gasherbrum I within a two-month period, followed by ascents of Shisha Pangma (2005), Kangchenjunga (2006), Manaslu (2007), Broad Peak (2007), and Makalu (2008). On 20 May 2009, Dujmovits climbed Lhotse‚Äîhis final 8000-metre peak‚Äîwith his former wife Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, Hirotaka Takeuchi and David G√∂ttler. This made Dujmovits the 16th person to climb all 14 eight- thousanders, and the first German person to do so. Dujmovits returned to Mount Everest in 2012 for the sixth time, attempting to climb it without bottled oxygen (Mount Everest is the only eight-thousander he has not climbed without bottled oxygen). Although he did not reach the summit, while he was descending he took a photo of a long queue of climbers queuing to ascend the mountain; the photo subsequently went viral and was described by Outside magazine as \\"the year's most iconic photo\\" and \\"the image that embodied a disastrous year on Everest\\". In 2014, he and Darek Zaluski attempted to make the first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat, but abandoned the expedition, citing dangerous conditions. Dujmovits has made more than 40 mountaineering expeditions in the Himalaya and Karakorum. In addition to climbing all 14 eight-thousanders, he has completed the Seven Summits challenge, which involves climbing the highest mountains on each continent.

His songs were regularly performed by Slim Dusty and other singers. He is the father of country music singer Tracy Coster. Early life Statue of \\"The Cunnamulla Fella\\" erected as a tribute to songwriter, Stan Coster and singer, Slim Dusty. The Cunnamulla Shire hall is in the background. Stan Coster was born at Casino on the north coast of New South Wales, Australia in 1930. One of seven children, each of whom were musically talented. He left school at the age of 14 and worked for a local butcher in Woolgoolga, NSW. By the age of 16, he was cutting sleepers for train tracks and at 18 years of age he went to work as a station hand before moving to Sydney and in 1948 moved to Cooma, New South Wales, to work on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. In 1950, at age 20, Coster joined a travelling rodeo as a rough rider and in 1951 he married Dorothy Aileen Milto, with whom he had three children, including country music singer Tracy Coster.  Musical career  In 1956, Coster began writing songs and met Slim Dusty in 1960 at Longreach, Queensland. Dusty recorded his first Coster song, ‚ÄúReturn of the Stockman‚Äù in 1962.

He fought and distinguished himself in the Battle of Jutland in April 1916, commanding from the armoured cruiser HMS Warrior. He was subsequently awarded the Russian Order of St. Anna for bravery, and was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath and Aide-de-camp to the King. Early life Molteno was born in Cape Town, then part of the Cape Colony, into a large family of Italian origin. He was the son of Sir John Charles Molteno, who at the time was Prime Minister of the Cape, and many of his relatives held positions of influence in business and government. Vincent Molteno had little interest in business though. His father died when he was 14 years old; he left the colony to enter the Royal Navy as a cadet. Soon after joining the Navy, he was discovered to be a lethally accurate shot, was selected for special training, and quickly distinguished as a gun specialist. In 1893 he was sent to take part in the Vitu Expedition to Zanzibar as a lieutenant to crush the slave trade,William Stewart: Admirals of the World, McFarland, 2009. p. 86 and was awarded the General African Medal. His extraordinary effectiveness on this mission was repeatedly reported in despatches, and led to his being promoted to Commander.Phillida Brooke Simons: Apples of the sun : being an account of the lives, vision and achievements of the Molteno brothers. Vlaeberg: Fernwood Press, 1999. World War I He commanded several warships in World War I, including HMS Revenge, Antrim, King George V, Shannon, Minotaur, and Bellerophon. It was from Revenge (also after she was renamed HMS Redoubtable) that he successfully led the bombardment of German bases along the Flanders coast. He also served as Flag-Captain of the 2nd Battle Squadron and the 3rd Cruiser Squadron. Armoured cruiser HMS Warrior (1905) Dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet Molteno fought at the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval engagement of the First World War, commanding from the armoured cruiser HMS Warrior. HMS Warrior was part of the ill-fated First Cruiser Squadron, which was deployed as a vanguard several miles ahead of the main British fleet.Nigel Steel, Peter Hart (2003). Jutland 1916: Death in the Grey Wastes. London: Casssell. . When contact was first made with the German High Seas Fleet, Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot boldly but unwisely ordered the First Cruiser Squadron to engage, and the small squadron thus found itself facing the combined firepower of the German dreadnoughts. Hopelessly outgunned, the other ships in Arbuthnot's squadron were swiftly blown to pieces and sank - taking their entire crews down with them. (Admiral Arbuthnot himself died when his ship was obliterated with all 903 hands, within minutes of the engagement beginning.)Gordon, Andrew (1996). The Rules of the Game: Jutland and British Naval Command. London: John Murray. However HMS Warrior fought on, exchanging fire with the combined line of German dreadnoughts for a considerable time. While able to manoeuvre somewhat to minimise the damage, Warrior was nevertheless taking hits from and shells, and beginning to suffer large fires and massive carnage on deck. With casualties mounting and signs of flooding, Molteno manoeuvred Warrior out of harm's way as the beleaguered HMS Warspite unintentionally drew the enemy fire.Marder, Arthur J. (1966). Volume III: Jutland and after, May 1916 ‚Äì December 1916. From the Dreadnought to Scapa Flow. Oxford University Press. Once out of danger, Molteno had the heavily damaged ship taken in tow, and the crew were safely landed (08:25, 1 June) before the ship was finally discarded and allowed to sink the next day. He was awarded the Order of St. Anna with Swords for his exceptional performance at the battle. A newspaper from the time reports: Molteno then led attacks on German forces that were covering Axis convoys in the North Sea, commanding from HMS Shannon, and when hostilities ended he was appointed aide-de-camp to the King and was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath. He retired in 1921 as rear-admiral but was promoted to vice admiral in 1926 while on the retired list. He died on 12 November 1952 aged 80. Family life Molteno married Ethel Manwaring Robertson in 1915, and they had one daughter Viola born in 1917. Ethel had been married twice before, firstly to George Batley in 1895 and then James Swanston in 1901. ReferencesFurther reading * Uys, I. South African Military History Who's who. 1452-1992.

Built in Pisan Romanesque style during the 12th-13th centuries, it was the seat of the now disappeared diocese of Sorres until 1505. Since 1950 the church and the annexed monastery have housed a community of Benedictine monks. The church is located at the top of a volcanic hill in the so-called Meilogu region. History Fa√ßade The site of San Pietro di Sorres has been inhabited since at least Neolithic times; archaeological excavations have proven the presence of the Carthaginians and the Romans also. The few existing documents attest the presence of a settlement known as Sorres here during the 12th century, which was the site of a bishopric. The construction of a cathedral church dedicated to Saint Peter was started in 1171-1178 under bishop Goffredo di Meleduno, and completed in the early 13th century. Marble pulpit Sorres started to decline from the 14th century, after the area fell to the Aragonese. The village was destroyed, with the exception of the cathedral, and the inhabitants were forced to flee to nearby towns, such as Borutta, which became the bishop's residence. The see was abolished in 1505, and was incorporated into the archdiocese of Sassari. The cathedral chapter of San Pietro di Sorres continued to celebrate in the church until all its members died. Subsequently, the church and its annexed edifices underwent a long period of decay, which was only halted by several restorations in the late 19th century. The church nevertheless remained abandoned until 1947, when it was chosen to house a group of Benedictine monks. New restorations were carried on from 1950 and a neo-Romanesque monastery was built next to it, incorporating the remains of the previous ruined buildings. The complex received the status of abbey in 1974. Description Central nave The church and the monastery occupy a plateau at the top of a hill, at some 540 meters above sea level, behind a large square. The exterior appearance of the church is characterized by the juxtaposition of black (basalt) and light white (sandstone) stones, as typical of Pisan-Lucchese medieval churches. The fa√ßade is divided into four horizontal sectors: the three lower sectors (that of the portal and those above it) feature blind arcades and loggias decorated by rhombi, another typical decoration of contemporary Tuscan religious buildings. On the first step of the portal is the inscription Mariane maistro, likely the name (\\"Master Marianus\\") of the mason who directed the construction. The sides and the apse are decorated with Lombard bands. The interior contains a nave and two side-aisles divided by eight cruciform piers, characterized by black and white bands, over which are rounded arches. The nave, covered with cross vaults, is illuminated by several mullioned windows; the wall of the west front has a double mullioned window and an oculus. The north aisle houses a 15th-century sculpture of the Madonna and Child, while at the third pier is a marble pulpit in Gothic style, whose dating is uncertain (perhaps the 14th century).

It is located south of Korumburra off the Korumburra to Wonthaggi Road and is southeast of Melbourne. History The original European settlers in the mid-19th century used the area for farming, but coal was discovered south of Outtrim railway station in 1892. The Outtrim and Jumbunna coal fields developed in the mid-1890s, with access to the markets for the coal being established via the Outtrim railway line. Outtrim Post Office opened on 10 May 1894 and closed in 1957. The township grew up by the mine and was named after the Honourable Alfred Richard Outtrim, MLA, Minister of Mines in the Victorian Government at the time. By the 1940s, only a small number of companies remained working the mines in the area. By the 1980s, the township of Outtrim had virtually disappeared, with only a few buildings remaining in the town area and the land returned to farming. A school was opened in 1895. When the coal mines were at their peak more than 200 children attended the four-roomed school. When coal production declined and then ceased with the closing of the mines in 1914, the population dwindled very quickly, with many moving to Wonthaggi where a large mine opened in 1909.Outtrim Cemetery, Australian Cemeteries The land around Outtrim is largely cleared of native vegetation and is used for agriculture, including dairying. Cemetery Outtrim Cemetery, established circa 1894, is set in woodland one kilometre east of Outtrim Recreation Reserve on the Leongatha South Road. The cemetery has fifteen marked graves, with the earliest dating from 1902. It is believed that there are a total of 220 burials in the cemetery, with last burial being in 1946. The cemetery is listed on the Victorian Heritage Inventory. The entire cemetery reserve is now reserved permanently for nature conservation purposes and is managed by Parks Victoria.

Sparks may be produced by pyrotechnics, by metalworking or as a by-product of fires, especially when burning wood. Pyrotechnics Sparks from a pyrotechnic sparkler. In pyrotechnics, charcoal, iron filings, aluminum, titanium and metal alloys such as magnalium may be used to create sparks. The quantity and style of sparks produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by spark testing. In the case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel ‚Äî about 0.7% is best for large sparks. The carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching sparks. The color of sparks used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that the sparks are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of the sparks. The basic color of sparks is limited to red/orange, gold (yellow) and silver (white). This is explained by light emission from a solid particle. Light emitted from solid particles is defined by black-body radiation. The temperature of the spark is controlled by the reactivity of the metal. Higher reactive metals lead to hotter sparks. The electronegativity has found to be an helpful indicator to estimate the temperature and consequently the color of a spark. To achieve colors differing from black body emitters, vapor phase combustion of the metal is necessary. A typical example is zinc, with a low boiling of 1180 K. Zinc sparks show an unusual bluish/greenish white appearance. Exotic sparks can be obtained from erbium powder. These sparks switch between surface and vapor phase combustion and accordingly between orange (black body) and green (element specific) emission. The color-change is based on the medium-ranged boiling point of erbium, which burns only partly in the vapor phase. The adjacent rare earth elements thulium, lutetium and yttrium can form color-changing sparks, too, although the visibility of both phases of the same spark is less pronounced due to a lower (Tm) or higher (Y, Lu) boiling point of the metal. The duration of a spark‚Äôs existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting spark. Metals with low thermal conductivity are especially good at producing sparks. Titanium and zirconium are especially good in this respect and so are now used in fireworks. Copper, on the other hand, has a high conductivity and so is poor at producing sparks. For this reason, alloys of copper such as beryllium bronze are used to make safety tools which will not spark so easily. Flint and steel The cold remnants of steel sparks struck by Robert Hooke using a flint. These were collected on paper, studied using his early microscope and drawn by hand. Robert Hooke studied the sparks created by striking a piece of flint and steel together. He found that the sparks were usually particles of the steel that had become red hot and so melted into globules. These sparks can be used to ignite tinder and so start a fire. In colonial America, flint and steel were used to light fires when easier methods failed. Scorched linen was commonly used as tinder to catch the spark and start the fire, but producing a good spark could take much time. A spinning steel wheel provided a good stream of sparks when it engaged the flint, and a tinderbox designed to do this was known as a mill. In a modern lighter or firesteel, iron is mixed with cerium and other rare earths to form the alloy ferrocerium. This readily produces sparks when scraped and burns hotter than steel would. This higher temperature is needed to ignite the vapour of the lighter fluid. Metal working Spray of sparks from a Bessemer converter as air is blown through the molten metal Molten metal sparks can be created when metal is heated by processes such as Bessemer conversion of iron to steel or arc welding. Sparks from spot welding robot Arc welding uses a low voltage and high current electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt the metals at the welding point, which often creates sparks. To reduce the risk of burns, welders wear heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat, flames, and sparks. In spot welding, metal surfaces that are held in contact are joined by the heat from resistance to electric current flow. It is common for a spray of sparks in the form of molten metal droplets to be ejected from the parts being joined. or the resistance heating of spot welding. Fires and spark arrestors A spark-arresting chimney on a locomotive Fires may produce sparks as updrafts carry particles of the burning fuel aloft. This was a great problem with steam locomotives as the sparks might set fire to the adjacent landscape or even to the train itself, especially if the engine burned wood rather than coal. To prevent this dangerous nuisance, a variety of spark arrestors were invented and fitted. The chimneys and exhausts of other fuel- burning engines such as steam engines or internal combustion engines might also have spark arrestors fitted if there would be a fire risk from their operation. For example, a trail bike might be fitted with a centrifugal arrestor, which will trap glowing hot pieces of soot. Symbolism The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo in which the spark of life is passed The significance of a spark as a source for a flame or a conflagration shows clearly, for example, in the naming and motto of Lenin's newspaper Iskra [The Spark]. The spark metaphor has often been used in philosophy since Stoicism and, recently, after Jacques Lacan. The ‚Äúcreative spark‚Äù has come to be considered as inherent to metaphor itself. Hasidic philosophy contains a doctrine of holy sparks (nitzotzot) from the kabbalism of Isaac Luria in which there is a duty to gather the sundered light of creation. In the Book of Job (Job 5:7), it is written, \\"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.\\" The use by King James' translators of the word sparks here is a poetic one rather than a literal one. The sparks of fire are identified by some translators as the sons of Resheph - a Canaanite deity of lightning and pestilence. In popular culture Sparks are frequently used in novels, comic books and movies to explain supernatural elements, or are sometimes used in advanced technology. In the DC Universe, Spark is an electricity powered metahuman that uses electomagnetic sparks, levitation and fields. In the 2016 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Doctor Strange, characters use Eldritch magic to create sparking objects like portals, whips, mandalas. In the Star Wars Universe, a spark projector is a tool carried by military-grade astromech droids of the Galactic Empire. They fire a concentrated bolt of electricity that short-circuits electronics, unlocks binders and electrocutes humans.

A methane explosion occurred in the mine at approximately 3:44 pm (NZDT, UTC+13). At the time of the explosion 31 miners and contractors were present in the mine. Two miners managed to walk from the mine; they were treated for moderate injuries and released from Greymouth Hospital the next day. The remaining 16 miners and 13 contractors were believed to be at least from the mine's entrance. Following a second explosion on 24 November at 2:37 pm, the 29 remaining men were believed by police to be dead. Police Superintendent Gary Knowles, officer in command of the rescue operation (Operation Pike) said he believed that \\"based on that explosion, no one survived.\\" A third explosion occurred at 3:39 pm on 26 November 2010, and a fourth explosion occurred just before 2 pm on 28 November 2010. According to the new mine owner, Solid Energy, the bodies of the 29 miners who died there may never be recovered. The Pike River Mine incident ranks as New Zealand's worst mining disaster since 1914, when 43 men died at Ralph's Mine in Huntly. It also resulted in the country's worst loss of life caused by a single disaster since the 1979 crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901, although it was surpassed three months later by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. In December 2012, then Prime Minister John Key said he would apologise in person to the families of the dead, for the Government's weak regulations and inadequate inspection regime. The Labour Government, elected in 2017, has established a new Pike River Recovery Agency, with re- entry expected by March 2019. It reports to the Minister Responsible for Pike River Re-entry, Andrew Little. Re-entry is expected to cost $23 million over three years. The agency took over the mine from Solid Energy, after it entered liquidation in mid-March 2018. After the re-entry, management of the mine area will return to the Department of Conservation, who are constructing a 'Pike29 Memorial Track', in the adjacent Paparoa National Park. Accident and response =Explosions  The first explosion is believed to have occurred at around 3:44 pm on 19 November 2010. Methane may have accumulated in a void formed during earlier mining activities, then been expelled into the rest of the mine by a roof fall, or it may have accumulated directly in working areas of the mine. It is not known what sparked the explosion, but a working mine contains several possible ignition sources. Two miners managed to walk from the mine later the same day, having been in the access tunnel, or just off it, some distance from the source of the explosion. Both were taken to Greymouth Hospital suffering moderate injuries. Initial media reports were unclear as to the number of miners and contractors remaining within the mine, with various numbers between 25 and 33 being mentioned. It was eventually ascertained that there were 16 miners and 13 contractors trapped. The names of the missing workers were released on 21 November. Mine officials noted that every worker carried a self-rescue device providing 30 minutes of air, and fresh air bases were provided within the mine for them to escape to in the event of an emergency; however, the refuges were empty and there was no evidence of miners attempting to reach them. When a borehole was drilled into the area where the miners were thought to be, a level of 95% methane was found, with the remainder primarily carbon monoxide. It appeared there was little chance that any of the miners who may have survived the blast could still be alive. Although families had held out hope that some of the miners may have survived, it was believed by the rescue team that all had been killed by the initial explosion. The mine had not collapsed and air was blowing freely throughout the tunnels indicating that there were no obstructions to survivors leaving the mine or indicating their presence by tapping on pipes or calling for help.Claire Harvey Never a Hope: This was not going to be Chile The Advertiser 28 November 2010 Pg 41‚Äì42 47‚Äì48 A second explosion occurred at 2:37 pm on 24 November 2010. Police Superintendent Gary Knowles stated that he believed no one could have survived. According to the CEO of the Pike River mine, Peter Whittall, the explosion was not caused by anybody working in or around the mine. The second explosion sent smoke, soot and explosive gases up a mine shaft where a team of rescue staff had been taking samples; the noise of the rising explosion provided them enough warning to get clear, evacuating the area on foot. A third explosion occurred at 3:39 pm on 26 November; it appeared to be smaller than the first two. A fourth significant explosion ignited the coal within the mine; the subsequent fire was visible above the ventilation shaft; the steel structure above the shaft was damaged and neighbouring scrub set alight. The fire appeared to be located near the bottom of the shaft, burning either loose coal or the seam itself, and considerably complicated efforts to stabilise the mine and made recovery of \\"intact\\" bodies unlikely. Gas monitoring The initial explosion damaged the mine's gas drainage line, causing methane gas to begin accumulating in the mine immediately. As there may have been a potential ignition source, it was too dangerous for rescuers to enter the mine. It was originally predicted to take several days before the mine was safe enough for rescuers to enter, as the gases inside were feared to be explosive. Initial testing at the mine ventilation shaft was hindered by heavy clouds, preventing helicopter access, and staff were going to have to walk in over rough terrain, as the shaft does not have road access. Seismic equipment was attached to tubes at the tunnel mouth to detect movement in the mine. With tests still not giving clearance for rescuers to enter the mine, an attempt was made to enter the mine using a bomb disposal robot provided by the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). The robot failed only into the mine due to water ingress. Sources noted that while the robot was capable of operating in rain, it had \\"effectively [been] hit by a waterfall\\", short-circuiting it. A second NZDF bomb disposal robot was placed on stand-by to enter. This robot had been fitted with extra batteries and other equipment to try to avoid the problems which hit the first robot. It was later deployed, and the first robot was later restarted. The robots entered the mine on 23 and 24 November, while a third, from Australia, was en route to the site. The use of three robots was unprecedented in mine rescue. The use of United States mining rescue/exploration robots was also being considered though the second explosion later that day effectively ended the robot efforts. Early on 24 November it was reported that a drill started from above the horizontal mine had reached to the mine chamber, releasing hot gas. Later in the day it was reported analysis showed 95% methane. A camera, inserted into a safe haven in the mine, found no evidence of human activity.  Rescue response  the Beehive to mark the official memorial service for the 29 miners on 2 December 2010. In accordance with the protocols established in New Zealand's Co-ordinated Incident Management System, the emergency response was led by New Zealand Police ‚Äì in this case Superintendent Gary Knowles, District Commander of the Tasman region. In addition to police, \\"Operation Pike\\" involved staff and management from Pike River Coal Ltd, the company operating the mine (represented at media and family conferences by CEO Peter Whittall), mine rescue experts from New Zealand and Australia, the Red Cross, ambulance services, the New Zealand Defence Force, and the Fire Service. The recovery phase was led by Inspector Mark Harrison, with Knowles in charge overall. A welfare centre was set up at the Red Cross Hall in Greymouth for the families of the trapped men. Police encouraged families to use this centre rather than trying to reach the mine's access road, which was closed to everyone except emergency services. After several days of delays in entering the mine, some locals expressed anger at what they considered the undue cautiousness of the rescue teams, noting that in historical accidents the rescue efforts were undertaken by fellow miners. In response to the continued criticism from various media and local families for their refusal to send rescuers into the mine, Trevor Watts, leader of the Mines Rescue, explained the team's belief that any rescuers would have also been killed given the conditions within the mine. Their cautious approach was supported by many international mine rescue experts. Both the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges placed trading halts on Pike River Coal (PRC) shares following the first explosion to allow the company time to \\"provide the market with a detailed update.\\" PRC's largest shareholder New Zealand Oil & Gas, which owns 29.4%, was also placed on a trading halt for two days; upon reinstatement the shares lost 29% of their value. PRC's shares were halted for 13 days. On 2 December, when New Zealand held a nationwide moment of silence, including at the stock exchange, PRC's suspension was inadvertently allowed to end and about 200,000 share trades were later invalidated. The first explosion was classified as a \\"highly, highly irregular event\\", and the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key immediately announced the government would hold an inquiry into its cause. It was later announced that the government would appoint a Royal Commission of Inquiry. In addition, the police and the coroner would conduct investigations ‚Äì as required by law ‚Äì as would the Department of Labour. On 24 November at 9:00 p.m., a service was held at the Holy Trinity Church in Greymouth, where hundreds of people gathered to mourn the loss of the workers. People at the service included Peter Whittall (CEO of Pike River Coal Ltd) and Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn who delivered a message from Pope Benedict XVI, saying that he shared the anxiety of the miners' families and that his prayers were with them. Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, sent to John Key a note expressing her condolences for the families of the deceased and calling the event a \\"national disaster\\", and her grandson, Prince William, sent a similar message to Key. A number of countries worldwide expressed their condolences, including the United Kingdom, Australia (where the Australian Parliament observed a moment's silence and flags were flown at half mast, in conjunction with New Zealand), and the United States. Recovery operation A Gorniczy Agregat Gasniczy (GAG) unit from Queensland, accompanied by 16 crew from Queensland Mines Rescue Service, was brought in on 26 November 2010 by the RNZAF, to be used in an attempt to suppress the fires. It was expected to take three days to assemble, and about five days for the fire-retardant emitted from the unit to fill the mine. On 10 December 2010, Police Commissioner Howard Broad said that the police intended to hand control of the recovery operation at the mine to the company. On 13 January 2011, Howard Broad told a media conference that the recovery of the bodies of the miners would be halted as it was impractical and too unsafe. Responsibility for securing the mine would be left with the receivers of Pike River Coal. On 14 January 2011, the police announced that the mine had been sealed as it was too dangerous to continue efforts to retrieve the bodies of the missing miners and contractors. On 17 January 2011, the receivers advised the police that their plan was to spend the next five to eight weeks stabilising the atmosphere in the mine and the underground heat sources. The plan did not include recovery of the bodies of the deceased miners. On 17 January 2011, it was further confirmed that recovery of the bodies was unlikely. On 9 March 2011, the receivers took control of the mine from the New Zealand Police. During inspection and recovery attempts, several robotic vehicles have been sent into the mine, but all four failed within the mine, for reasons such as water ingress into their electronics, or getting stuck. In February 2013 a panel of experts, including representatives from Solid Energy, the government and families of the deceased, met to discuss whether retrieval of the bodies would be possible if they had the necessary funding. They came to the conclusion it could be done, and the government promised to fund the effort if its High Hazards Unit agreed. In October Solid Energy with the assistance of the New Zealand Defence Force started the Pike re-entry project in an effort to send mine rescue and other experts 2.3 km into the drift access tunnel and close to the debris blockage caused by a roof fall. The following year WorkSafe wrote to Solid Energy stating that the re-entry plan made at that time was ‚Äò‚Äòsafe and technically feasible‚Äô‚Äô; and this became public knowledge the following month, in September 2014. In November Solid Energy announced the decision to not re-enter the mine due to safety concerns, saying that if rescuers re- entered there was an unmanageable risk that more people would die. Victims The 29 men ranged in age from 17 to 62. The youngest, Joseph Dunbar, was on his first shift underground after celebrating his 17th birthday the previous day. Dunbar had been due to start work at the mine on 22 November but had convinced management to allow him to start on the 19th.Claire Harvey Never a Hope: This was not going to be Chile The Advertiser 28 November 2010 Pg 47 Of the 29, 24 were New Zealanders, two were Scottish, two were Australian, and one was South African. The 24 New Zealanders were predominantly West Coasters, though they also included one Southlander. The victims included, among others, Grey District Councillor Milton Osborne and two West Coast representative sportsmen, South Island rugby league player Blair Sims and West Coast Rugby Union player Michael Monk. One of the trapped miners, Benjamin Rockhouse, was the brother of survivor Daniel Rockhouse, one of the two men who walked clear of the mine after the initial explosion. Aftermath The New Zealand Warriors and Newcastle Knights opened their 2011 season schedule with a charity match to raise money for the West Coast region. In a joint partnership between the two teams, the NZRL and NRL, all money raised from the match was divided between the Pike River mining relief fund and the West Coast Rugby League. The teams arrived on 3 February to carry out community appearances in the region. The Crusaders also announced that they would play their first home match of the 2011 Super Rugby season in the West Coast Rugby Union jersey. These were later auctioned off to raise money for the Pike River mining relief fund. On 17 March 2011, after attending a national memorial service for the earthquake in Christchurch, Prince William visited Greymouth and met families affected by the disaster. On 27 June 2011, The Australian featured an article titled \\"Miners doomed by fatal flaws\\" which alleged that Peter Whittall had not ensured the Pike River Mine had installed safety measures common in Australia, but not legally required in New Zealand. The possible safety measures not used in the Pike River Mine were; a \\"tube bundle\\" gas monitoring system, stocks of food and water, breathing apparatus, and a second escape route. Whittall has consistently maintained that safety standards were high. A former mine supervisor alleged that miners continued to work when the methane gas concentrations exceeded the threshold of 2 per cent. It is also alleged that the miners routinely blew compressed air over the methane alarms to prevent them from triggering. In November 2013, the Christchurch-based journalist Rebecca Macfie published the book Tragedy at Pike River Mine: How and Why 29 Men Died, based on research and interviews into the causes of the disaster. Several commentators criticised successive National and Labour Party governments for deregulating safety in the mining sector and some also argued that the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union (EPMU), which had several members at Pike River, did not do enough to prevent the tragedy. In the days after the explosion, EPMU leader Andrew Little (who later became Labour Party leader) said there had been no problems at Pike River Coal and defended its safety record. The Blackball Museum of Working Class History includes a memorial wheel dedicated to those who have died at work in New Zealand, with a special section for the miners who died in the Pike River Mine disaster. It was the site of a memorial service to mark the fourth anniversary of the event; wreaths were laid and a choir performed a piece dedicated to the victims. Royal Commission In November 2010, Prime Minister John Key announced that the Government would conduct a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the disaster, to be led by Justice Graham Panckhurst. Unionist Matt McCarten criticised the composition of the Commission on the grounds that it should have at least one union member, which government had refused, arguing that including union members would risk bias. On 13 December 2010, Attorney-General Chris Finlayson announced the names of the two people to join Judge Pankhurst on the Royal Commission of Inquiry: Stewart Bell, the Queensland State Government Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health; and David Henry, formerly Inland Revenue Commissioner and Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission. The Royal Commission was originally expected to report its findings by March 2012. On 30 October 2012, the Chair of the Royal Commission, the Hon Justice Pankhurst presented the Royal Commission report to the Attorney-General Chris Finlayson in Wellington. The Royal Commission's Final Report was released to the public on 5 November 2012. Later that day, the Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson resigned her portfolio in response to the conclusion that the regulation and inspection of mining by the Department of Labour had failed to prevent the accident. The former directors John Dow, Ray Meyer, Stuart Nattrass and former chief executive Peter Whittall rejected accusations of running an unsafe mine and said they disagreed with the Royal Commission's conclusion that the directors had not acted properly over health and safety at the mine. Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn blamed the mine managers. On 12 December 2012, the Government released a plan to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission.  Prosecutions  In November 2010, the Police and the Department of Labour began investigating the accident for grounds for prosecution. The investigation involved a team of up to 15 staff who conducted more than 200 interviews. In November 2011, the Department of Labour formally initiated the prosecution of three parties under the Health Safety and Employment Act: Pike River Coal Limited (in receivership), VLI Drilling Pty Limited (Valley Longwall International) and Peter William Whittall for 25 charges of alleged health and safety failures associated with the accident. On 31 July 2012, the contracting company Valley Longwall International pleaded guilty in the Greymouth District Court to three health and safety charges. The receivers for Pike River Coal Limited advised that the company would not enter a plea to the charges. Peter Whittall did not appear in court for his 12 health and safety charges and his case was adjourned to October. On 25 October 2012, Peter Whittall entered not guilty pleas. On 26 October 2012, Valley Longwall International, who had lost three employees in the mine, was fined $46,800. In July 2013, Pike River Coal was ordered to pay $110,000 to each of the victims' families and fined $760,000.$110,000 awarded to Pike River victims, families, although it was in receivership and therefore likely to be insolvent. 3 News NZ. 5 July 2013. In the end it did not pay the fine and only paid $5,000 to each family, saying it did not have the money.Shareholders deny Pike River families' reparation. 3 News NZ. 30 October 2013.Pike River disaster third anniversary. Radio NZ. 19 November 2013. In December 2013, charges were dropped against ex-Pike River boss Peter Whittall. Instead, Whittall and Pike River Coal offered a voluntary payment on behalf of the directors and officers of the company to the families of the men and two survivors. Prosecutors claimed there was a lack of evidence against Whittall. Some family members criticised the decision to drop charges and in August 2016 two family members sought a judicial review of the decision. The disaster has led to calls for New Zealand to introduce a crime of corporate manslaughter, and Labour leader Andrew Little has a bill in the members' ballot that would introduce a new crime modelled on the United Kingdom's Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act. Some criminal law experts believe, > \\"[D]isasters like Pike River seem to point inexorably towards the need to > better regulate the activities of corporate managers and to create a > stronger safety culture around workplace environments. Corporate > manslaughter ought to be considered, together with other regulatory > mechanisms, as means of better protecting employees and members of the > public from corporate negligence and unsafe practies\\". Mine re-entry After an agreement was signed between New Zealand's major political parties in Wellington on 15 August 2017, soon-to-be Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern pledged that a manned re-entry of the mine would be conducted with the object of recovering bodies and investigating the cause of the explosion. Meanwhile, preparations for a robotic entry later in the year continued. On 20 November 2017, Minister for Pike Mine Re-entry Andrew Little announced the creation of a stand-alone government department called the Pike River Recovery Agency to explore plans to re-enter the mine and recover the bodies of the deceased miners. On 31 January 2018, the Pike River Recovery Agency formally came into existence with its headquarters being in Greymouth. On 19 April, Little, as Minister for Pike Mine Re-entry, entered the mine's portal with Pike Family representatives Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse to demonstrate that a safe re-entry was possible. He vowed that the coalition Government would re-enter the drift to recover evidence and the remains of the deceased miners. On 21 May 2019, a mine recovery team led by Pike River Recovery Agency chief operating officer Dinghy Pattinson re-entered the mine for the first time since 2010, breaking the concrete seal to the mine drift. Body recovery and forensic operations are expected to take several months. The mine re-entry was marked by family members releasing 29 yellow balloons and calling out the names of those who died. Re-entry and recovery operations will consist of three phases. The first team of miners will re-enter to assess hazards and to establish infrastructure for supporting the roofs and sides of the drift. A second forensically-focused mining team will then enter the mine to examine and remove any evidential material. A third team will providing mining services including gas monitoring, communications lines and ventilation bags. Once completed, the site is expected to be refurbished and handed back to the Department of Conservation. On 10 June 2020, Minister for Pike Mine Re- entry Andrew Little announced that it was \\"impractical\\" to expect the remains of the fallen miners to be recovered. Instead, recovery efforts would focus on gathering evidence for the homicide case. The cost of the recovery project had risen from NZ$23 million to NZ$35 million, with concerns that the figure could reach NZ$50 million.

Technologies utilized include mechanical servo, solid state and strain gauge. These precision measurement tools are available as both off-the-shelf and bespoke for use in military, aerospace, civil and industrial engineering applications. Sherborne Sensors is based in ‚Äòtransducer valley‚Äô in Hampshire, UK, and supplies its products to over 50 countries across the world. Many of the inertial products currently offered have evolved from the Schaevitz brand that innovated sensor design during the 1940s and 1950s. The current LSOC/LSOP range of Linear Servo Inclinometers originate from the genuine Schaevitz units. The Force Transducers have their roots with the Maywood brand founded in the 1970s.  History  Sherborne Sensors began life in 1945 as Schaevitz Engineering, a New Jersey-based manufacturer of LVDTs and other precision sensors. The business operated solely in the USA until an association formed with Electro-Mechanisms (EM) in 1963. This allowed their products to be distributed in the UK and also to be manufactured under licence. Prompted by the success overseas, Schaevitz Engineering acquired the majority shareholding in EM and began manufacturing a UK range of inertial products in 1974. The Schaevitz name traded until 1986 when the company was acquired by Lucas who changed the name of the business to Lucas Control Systems. In 1997 the company became Lucas Varty and in 1999 was acquired by TRW. Throughout all of this time the Schaevitz brand remained strong and at the cutting edge of sensors technologies. This business model continued until August 2000 when the Schaevitz Sensors and Components division of TRW was acquired by Measurement Specialities Inc (MSI). In 2002 the Measurement Specialties UK group was put into financial receivership and its assets sold. A group of former Schaevitz employees purchased the Inertial Products Division from MSI and formed the Sherborne Sensors Limited Company in July 2002 thus continuing the design, development and manufacture of precision sensors. In 2007, Sherborne Sensors extended its product range beyond inertial sensors by obtaining the former Maywood Instruments force transducer product lines and intellectual property from FTSA Holdings Limited. Following this expansion, Sherborne Sensors has extended its operation globally, establishing a sales and stocking location in North American in 2009.

After carving out of New District of Chakwal in 1985 from Jhelum and Attock, this subdivision was detached from Pind Dadan Khan Tehsil of Jhelum District and was included into Tehsil Chakwal. Now village Khairpur is a part of Kallar Kahar Tehsil, located on the road leading to Choa Saiden Shah 10 Kilometres eastward of Kallar Kahar motorway interchange. The soil is thin and stony and cultivation depends upon the capricious rainfall in these blue serrated hills. Agriculture and military service were the main professions of residents until a few years ago. Now the population are entering employment in sectors such as education, healthcare and business. The old name Khardare was changed to Khairpur in 1947. History Nobody exactly knows when this settlement came into existence. It is believed that the early settlers like other Awan Tribes came with Qutab Shah, the ruler of Herat and a general in Ghaznavids Army during the expedition of subcontinent in 11th century and settled at Kharli in Wanh√°r Area in western Salt Range. Later one elder of the clan migrated to the present place. This small hamlet which was built up on a steep hillock to defend from the other warrior tribes turned into a village with the passage of time. The village was named as Khardehr with association to Kharli. Nothing is known about Mughal period and other rulers time. As listened by elder the worst time for the village was Sikh Raj (1801‚Äì1849), when the gangs of Sikh Bandits and their tax collector(K√°rd√°r) used to extort the produce as they desired from the threshing-floor at the time of harvesting.[Sher Khan S/O Sultan Khan] The Tribe is further subdivided into clans \\"Virrhees\\" with association to their elders. * Majhial * Janial * Mumial * Gulsherias * Charkhal * Akbral * Phails * Ujrals * Bhudhials * Roadas * Pathlial * Chiddas * Artisans Governmental institutions A middle school was established by the District Board Jhelum in 1928 which was upgraded to a high school in 1984.

He has held a NEH Fellowship, was Simon Honorary Professor at Manchester University and has twice been the Advanced Fellow at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Studies Turner was born in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in 1968 and then attended the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. He received his undergraduate and his two master's degrees (one in philosophy and one in sociology) and his Ph.D. in sociology, with a dissertation on a philosophical topic, later published as Sociological Explanation as Translation (1980) by Cambridge University Press in the Rose Monograph series of the American Sociological Association. He later studied with Richard Rorty and Edward Shils. He began his long affiliation with the University of South Florida in 1975. In 1987 Turner was appointed Graduate Research Professor in Sociology; since 1989 he has held the same title, now Distinguished University Professor, but in Philosophy. He has had visiting appointments at Virginia Tech, the University of Notre Dame, and Boston University. He is on the editorial board of some 15 journals, and is the longest serving \\"Collaborating Editor\\" of Social Studies of Science. Scholarly interests Practices: Turner has published in the overlapping fields of sociology and philosophy, particularly on the notion of practices. In The Social Theory of Practices as well as in other writings Turner argues against collective concepts like culture: what we call culture (and similar concepts), he argues, needs to be understood in terms of the means of its transmission. There is no collective server by which it is simply downloaded and \\"shared\\". What we take as \\"collective\\" is really produced through experiences of interaction which are different and produce different results for different individuals but which also produce a rough uniformity through mechanisms of feedback rather than \\"sharing\\". He has extended this argument in various places, most recently in relation to the philosophical idea of \\"normativity\\" which he argues is an explanation of \\"facts\\" which are the product of an unnecessary and mystery-producing redescription motivated by an attempt to take back ground from social science explanation. Political theory: In the area of political theory, Turner has argued that the rise of expert knowledge has altered the conditions of liberal democracy by increasing the importance of a new form of politically relevant inequality: epistemic inequality. But, Turner does not argue that inequality justifies the reliance on experts. Instead, he argues that this is only one solution among many to the problems produced by the fact that knowledge is distributed unequally. Turner uses examples such as the claims in economics and the debate over climate change to show that reliance on experts can go wrong, and that the mechanisms of self-policing attributed to the scientific community are often ineffective. Deciding whether or not to accept the products of experts or expert communities is a political decision. To the extent that such decisions replace democratic deliberation or become the content of democratic deliberation, liberal democracy itself becomes transformed from government by discussion among the equally informed into contestation over expertise itself. History of Sociology: Turner is also recognized for his contributions to the history of sociology, especially in The Impossible Science, a contemporary overview of the history of American sociology. He has published on the methodology of the social sciences, including the notion of causality. In particular, he focuses on the problems in statistical causality and the process of selection. This is connected to Turner's work on Max Weber's theory of causality, which Turner has shown is derived from law and legal probability, most notably in Max Weber. Lawyer as Social Thinker. He has also stressed Weber's use of empathy (Einf√ºhlung) to solve the generic problem of the under-determination of description. Turner is also editor or co-editor of an additional 11 books and author of some 60 articles, 44 book chapters, and 36 review essays and published exchanges.

Books in the series So far there have been eight books released in the series, with the eighth book released in September 2015. * Death Cloud (June 2010): Fourteen-year-old Sherlock Holmes is sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle in Hampshire and teams up with Matty Arnatt to investigate two mysterious deaths which appear to be somehow related to a black cloud which Sherlock Holmes has to solve. * Red Leech, retitled Rebel Fire for the American market, (November 2010): A few months after the events of the first novel, Holmes investigates the possibility that John Wilkes Booth is alive and well, and living in England. The investigation takes Sherlock to America with his tutor, Amyus Crowe. * Black Ice (June 2011): Mycroft invites Sherlock and his tutor to London for a visit, but when they arrive at the Diogenes Club they find Mycroft with a dagger in his hand and a dead body on the floor. The adventure takes them from the depths of the London sewers to the frozen Russian landscapes. * Fire Storm (November 2011): Fourteen-year-old Sherlock has come up against some challenges in his time, but what confronts him now is completely baffling. His tutor, Crowe, and Crowe's daughter, Virginia, have vanished. Their house looks as if nobody has ever lived there. *Snake Bite (September 27, 2012): Sherlock finds himself facing another mystery after being kidnapped and taken to China on a ship named as the Gloria Scott. * Knife Edge (October 2013): Takes place in Ireland. Following the events of the last book Sherlock returns home to find himself stuck in the middle of a kidnapping. * Stone Cold (September 2014): Following his last adventure, Sherlock Holmes has been sent to live in Oxford to focus on his education but something strange is happening in the university pathology labs. *Night Break (September 2015): Sherlock's mother has died, his father has gone missing in India and his sister is acting strangely. The Holmes family seems to be falling apart, and not even brother Mycroft can keep it together. A mysterious disappearance leads them to Egypt and the Suez Canal. Background Based on the success of Charlie Higson's bestselling Young Bond series, the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle authorised a series of books detailing the life of the teenage Sherlock Holmes'. One of Andrew Lane's key aims is to explain some of the complexities of Holmes' character, who is scientific and analytical on the one hand, and artistic and moody on the other. Two new characters introduced in this series, his two tutors, Amyus Crowe and Rufus Stone, will help shed light on the formation of the two sides of his character evident in later life. Lane also wanted to ensure that his stories jibed with the original Doyle stories as it bothered him that Watson was presented as a young friend of Holmes in Young Sherlock Holmes which contradicts the events of A Study in Scarlet. Lane's initial proposal provided ideas for potential plots for entries in the series; * The Giant Rat of Sumatra (mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\\") * The Remarkable Worm Unknown to Science (mentioned in \\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\\") * Colonel Warburton‚Äôs Madness (mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\\") * The Segregation of the Queen (mentioned in \\"His Last Bow\\") Reception Chicago Tribune gave Death Cloud a positive review stating: Graham Moore, author of The Sherlockian, reviewed Death Cloud for The New York Times and stated: See also *The Boy Sherlock Holmes *Young Sherlock Holmes ReferencesExternal links * Official Young Sherlock Holmes site (U.K.) * Official Young Sherlock Holmes series site (U.S.) Category:Book series introduced in 2010 Category:Young Sherlock Holmes book series Category:Young adult novel series ","title":"Young Sherlock Holmes (books)"},{"id":"29659754","text":"Caloptilia chrysolampra is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

It was demolished in 2002 despite being protected as a category B listed building. It was located on the south bank of the River Teith, in Stirling council area. History Once spelt Lanarkyngs, this name is taken as coming by metathesis from the old Brittonic word llanerch which meant \\"a clearing in a forest\\".MacKay, Moray S.(1953). Doune Historical Notes, p. 73. Forth Naturalist and Historian Board . Lanrick was the property of the Haldane family. In the 19th century it belonged to the MacGregors, and was owned in the later 19th century by Robert Jardine of Castlemilk, MP. The house was probably built around 1790, and Gothic additions in the style of James Gillespie Graham were made in around 1815. Further alterations were made in the later 19th century, and parts of the building underwent internal remodelling in 1900. Alistair Dickson inherited Lanrick in 1984. In April 1994 the castle was gutted by fire and lost its roof. On 16 February 2002 the remaining structure was demolished. Dickson was prosecuted for demolishing a listed structure without the necessary consent, and was fined ¬£1,000 in January 2003. The sheriff also criticised Stirling Council for failing to take action to secure the building. Other structures Remaining buildings on the estate include the MacGregor Monument, erected by Sir Evan John Murray MacGregor in the earlier 19th century.

Adenanthos is a taxonomic section of the flowering plant genus Adenanthos (Proteaceae). It comprises 29 species. The centre of diversity is southwest Western Australia, with two species extending into South Australia and western Victoria. Description The section is characterised by flowers in which the perianth is straight, at least at first; all four stamens are fertile; and the style end is narrow, and conical or cylindrical. Taxonomy The section was first described and published by George Bentham in the 1870 fifth volume of his landmark work Flora Australiensis, under the name Adenanthos sect. Stenolaema. Bentham listed several diagnostic characters for the species including the straight perianth- tube; the fertility of all four anthers; and the narrow style-end. At the time of publication it contained 12 species. Bentham did not specify a type species for A. sect. Stenolaena, but in modern times this is of no import, as the section contains the type species of the genus, A. obovatus, and must therefore have the same type; the section was formally lectotypified in this way by Ernest Charles Nelson in 1978. For the same reason, the modern laws of botanical nomenclature require the section to take the autonym Adenanthos sect. Adenanthos; thus A. sect. Stenolaena is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of A. sect. Adenanthos. In 1978, Nelson published a comprehensive taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. He retained A. sect. Adenanthos, making no change to its circumscription, except that there were by this time 29 species assignable to it. He further divided the section into two subsections, A. subsect. Anaclastos and A. subsect. Adenanthos, but subsequently discarded them in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement and circumscription of A. sect. Adenanthos in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus Distribution and habitat 27 of the 29 species in this section are endemic to southwest Western Australia. A. macropodianus is endemic to Kangaroo Island in South Australia; and A. terminalis ranges from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, east to western parts of Victoria.

Cawthorn is best known as the 2009 Young Australian of the Year for Tasmania and his work as a motivational speaker.  Personal life  Cawthorn was born in Perth, Western Australia to an Indian mother,Annie (Kharagpur, West Bengal) and Scottish father,Peter, in a family of 11 children. While still a young child his family relocated to rural Tasmania where he grew up on country farm outside of Hobart. He now resides in Balmain, Sydney with his wife Kate Cawthorn and their three children.  Career = Early career  After completing Matriculation College, Cawthorn worked in sales at Pizza Hut before discovering a passion for helping people. This inspired him to work as a trainer in Northern Tasmania and lead to his promotion as a training manager. He later established himself as a Regional Industry Careers Adviser and assisted local industry to identify skill shortages and provide solutions for youth entering the workforce. Cawthorn was also involved in numerous musical theatre productions and established his own music and dance studio.  Near Fatal Car Accident  In October 2006, Cawthorn was involved in a head-on collision with a semi-trailer, he was travelling at a speed of 102 km/h and needed to be resuscitated. He faced severe injuries including the amputation of his right arm above the elbow and severe damage to his right leg. Initially distraught by the prospect he may never walk again he maintained a strong mental attitude and conceptualized \\"Be Motivated\\" during his nine months of rehabilitation.  Be Motivated and Motivational Speaking  In 2007 Cawthorn established Be Motivated, a program aimed at providing young people with skills to improve their confidence and self-belief in order to attain personal goals while remaining positive when faced with adversity. To deliver this information he regularly conducts motivational assemblies at schools in Australia and around the world.  Teachings  A large part of Cawthorn‚Äôs teachings focus on challenging people to discover a purpose and develop goals. He strongly emphasises the importance of a healthy mental attitude and not allowing excuses to hinder achievements. Cawthorn also advocates \\"bouncing forward\\" after a crisis and not being discouraged by challenges and setbacks which may arise. According to his philosophy, a \\"Plan B\\" is unnecessary. He encourages audiences to create environments which leverage collective thinking in order to reach challenging decisions that enable recovery from difficult situations.  2009 Young Australian of the Year for Tasmania  In November 2008 Sam Cawthorn was awarded the 2009 Young Australian Year Award for Tasmania.  Encounter with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd Before gathering at The Lodge with fellow Australian of the Year finalists, Cawthorn accepted a dare from his young daughter to play a practical joke upon then Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. As the two shook hands, Cawthorn detached his artificial hand from its prosthetic arm leaving a surprised but highly amused Rudd holding the artificial hand. The former prime minister later told the reception honouring the finalists he had not recovered from shock and was still \\"in therapy\\".  Cawthorn Foundation  In 2009 the Cawthorn Foundation was established to assist disadvantaged youth in developing countries to enjoy basic human rights. The foundation partners with like-minded organisations to create awareness in businesses and schools across the world. Throughout 2009 Cawthorn travelled to India and held a series of motivational seminars for students and the Indian army.  Create2Change  In mid-2009 CBM Australia approached Cawthorn to become ambassador for their human rights advocacy movement which creates awareness for people living with disabilities in developing nations. Under a campaign titled ‚ÄòCreate2Change‚Äô Cawthorn travelled around India with a film crew to find stories of individuals living with a disability in the most poverty stricken communities.  Facts  Sam Cawthorn is a musician and one of the few people in the world able to play a guitar with an above elbow amputation.

The spirits in prison are angels  * Jesus proclaimed triumph over the fallen angels Support for the understanding that the spirits in prison are angelic beings and not people is thought to be confirmed by II Peter 2:4‚Äì5 and Jude 6, which refer to rebellious angels, punished by God with imprisonment. Just like I Pet. 3, II Pet. 2 also refers to the time of Noah's flood, including the number of people saved in the ark. However, the text in 2 Peter uses a different word for the location of the angels than I Peter does. in 2 Peter 2, the word used is tartaroo, other wise known as Tartarus. In I Peter 3:19, the word is phylake (can also be anglic. as Phylace), meaning prison. * Angels and the Book of Enoch Friedrich Spitta (1890),F.

While he identified the spirits in prison with the rebellious angels who instigate the wickedness of the flood, he followed Augustine..\\" Joachim Jeremias and others suggested that Peter was making a first reference to Enochic traditions, such as found again in the Second Epistle of Peter chapter 2 and the Epistle of Jude. Stanley E. Porter considers that the broad influence of this interpretation today is due to the support of Edward Selwyn (1946).Edward Selwyn, The First Epistle of St. Peter (London: Macmillan, 1946) Human souls The concept that the dead await a general resurrection and judgment either in blessed rest or in suffering after a particular judgement at death was a common 1st century Jewish belief (see Lazarus and Dives and bosom of Abraham). A similar concept is taught in the Eastern Orthodox churches, was championed by John Calvin (who vigorously opposed Luther's doctrine of soul sleep), and is reflected in some Early Church Fathers. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this verse is used in conjunction with 1 Peter 4:6 to support the belief that in the three days between Christ's death and resurrection, He visited the spirit world and set in motion the work of teaching the gospel to those who didn't receive it during mortality, providing them the opportunity to repent and accept saving ordinances performed on their behalf in Latter-day Saint temples. Other religious traditions This belief also appears in Islam as barzakh, and in 9th-century Zoroastrian writing (after and perhaps due to two centuries of Muslim influence and several more of Christian influence). Greek philosophy In the Ph√¶drus, Socrates likens the soul of the body to be as imprisoned as an oyster is bound to its shellPh√¶drus 249d-250c'\\" at mc.maricopa.edu website during the discourse on metempsychosis with Phraedrus. However, the Greek word psyche mentioned in 1 Peter 3:20 is usually translated as \\"person\\" and not by \\"soul\\". The latter represents both the inner self and its status after corporal death, whereas in the current verse it is used as a synonym of the Jewish word nephesh, in a holistic sense and without any metaphysical dualism. The word psyche is applied by St. Peter uniquely to humans and not for animals.

M√∏ller & Chastine Mc-Kinney M√∏ller Foundation, a Danish institution, set up in 1953 by shipping magnate A.P. M√∏ller. History In 1988 Churchill College contacted the A.P. M√∏ller & Chastine Mc-Kinney M√∏ller Foundation, a Danish institution set up in 1953 by shipping magnate A.P. M√∏ller, looking for funding for additional postgraduate student accommodation. The Foundation makes contributions to good causes, especially those involving national heritage, shipping, industry and science. M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller was keen to support a development at Churchill College because of the College's tradition of excellence in the fields of science and engineering, and in memory of Winston Churchill. He felt that Denmark's safety during the Second World War and prosperity afterwards, had depended on Churchill's personal involvement. When war broke out Maersk ships were turned over to the British authorities to assist in the War effort, and Churchill was swift to ensure the company was paid compensation at the end of the war. Having looked at the need for funding, M√∏ller proposing the concept of a \\"Centre for Excellence\\" which would include meeting rooms, bedrooms and bring together commerce and education. He believed that with access to the full educational and research resources of the University of Cambridge, the Institute would be able to offer the highest standard of continuing education to international businesses wishing to develop their managerial, executive, research and development staff. In 1992, M√∏ller Instutute was formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Ingrid of Denmark, located on the grounds of Churchill College in Cambridge. The foundation financed an expansion and improvement of the facilities in 2014-15. Buildings The main building was designed by a Danish Architect, Henning Larsen, with features of the Institute in typical Scandinavian design. The main building is made of Portland Stone and has teak floors throughout. The dominating element of the Institute is the octagonal tower - from the terrace on the top there is a view over the centre of Cambridge.

It was distributed by North American Film Productions, Oregon Ltd., at the height of public fascination with accounts and tales of Bigfoot sightings. The film follows a group of explorers on a summer-long search for the mythical Bigfoot creature. The audience is informed that the search takes place in Northwest Canada (British Columbia) along the 'Peckatoe River Valley' but in reality the movie was filmed further south in the Three Sisters Wilderness area of the Cascade Mountain Range near Bend, Oregon. While sometimes compared to other Bigfoot documentary films of the era such as The Legend of Boggy Creek (1972) and Creature From Black Lake (1976), the film does not feature on-camera interviews with possible eyewitnesses. The producers strived for a sense of believability and used taglines like \\"The most complete and only true story of Bigfoot ever filmed\\" in promotional material. The film features a number of animal stunts, including cougar and bear attacks. To simulate the grizzly attack, Tootsie Rolls were placed on actor Lou Salerni's shoulder, where they were eaten by the trained bear. Animals were supplied by Dick Robinson who, along with Sasquatch co-producer and editor John Fabian, went on to make a Grizzly Adams-type film \\"The Life and Legend of Buffalo Jones\\". That film was also co-directed by Sasquatch cast member / narrator George Lauris and its soundtrack contains music by Sasquatch contributors Al Capps & Lane Caudell. The \\"Life and Legend of Buffalo Jones\\" film ultimately became known as Buffalo Rider. Plot The film begins in the forest with shots of local wildlife, agitated and on alert, but the source is not seen on screen. The camera then switches to a first person view, hinting at an unseen presence and the scene culminates with the view of a large human-like creature's reflection at water's edge while a haunting wail echos through the forest. Opening credits are next, followed by a review of recent Bigfoot stories via newspaper clippings and narration. Next up is the well-known Patterson‚ÄìGimlin film, shot by Roger Patterson on October 20, 1967, in Bluff Creek, CA which shows an ape- like creature walking along a dry creek bed. The narrator goes on to explain that by running statistical data through modern computers, a site in British Columbia has been determined as the most likely spot for a population of Sasquatch to live undisturbed. An expedition is mounted, hoping to verify the creature's existence and secure funding for future research into the phenomenon. The seven man team is composed of Native American guide Techka Blackhawk, seasoned wilderness explorer Josh Bigsby, wise-cracking reporter Bob Vernon, anthropologist Dr. Paul Markham, cook Barney Snipe, animal handler Hank Parshall and team leader Chuck Evans who also narrates the film. The team is on horseback and brings tracking dogs to aid in the hunt. As the film progresses, tales of Sasquatch encounters by earlier explorers are interwoven with the current expedition's adventure and told as campfire stories. These scenes are recreated by uncredited cast members and include the Ape Canyon incident in which miners are attacked while sleeping in their cabin and an encounter by early pioneer explorers Bauman and Jessup. Initially the expedition takes on the feel of a nature trek, but as we reach a scene where the team is traversing a hillside it takes on a more ominous feel. As rocks begin tumbling down towards them from above, Techka stops the caravan in time to avoid injuries but the cause of the rockslide is unknown. From this point on the film becomes more focused on its intended subject, the search for Bigfoot. After this incident the team feels they're being watched by 'someone or something' and everyone takes turns guarding the camp at night. One evening a bear attacks while they sleep and everyone is shaken up but none are seriously injured. On a subsequent evening the camp is once again attacked, but this time the lookout was able to scare off the attacker(s) with gunshots. The following day they find large footprints in the areas surrounding the camp and employ the tracking dogs. While some team members take plaster molds of the tracks, Hank and his dogs follow a scent to the base of a sheer rock wall but cannot continue due to the difficult terrain. As the expedition nears their intended destination, they discover tall trees snapped in half well above human reach. Techka tells them it is a sign the Sasquatch use to mark their territory and upon entering the valley, the team finds more footprints and sets up camp. They install a tripwire system around the perimeter and post lookouts. The team notes that the forest is eerily quiet that evening and well after dark, the inevitable happens. Multiple sensors begin to light up, the camp is attacked and we hear the same haunting wail as earlier. As the lookouts scramble for a clear shot with their tranquilizer guns, large boulders and branches are thrown in from multiple directions. Paul Markham is injured by one of the rocks and one of the shadowy creatures actually invades the camp and destroys most of the surveillance equipment. The attackers are eventually scared off and when daylight comes the team gets a good look at the devastation. There are many footprints around the camp but no signs of a dead or wounded Sasquatch. By now summer is almost over and winter storms are looming so the team packs up and begins their long trek back to civilization. In the final scene the camera pans out to a wide shot of the team departing, showcasing a picturesque view of the valley and its surrounding mountains. During the closing credits we see a large human-like silhouette, the same one seen in promotional movie posters, looking down at the camera from a hilltop as it slowly turns and walks away.

The film's producer, Ronald Olson, was a real-life bigfoot researcher who founded the Eugene, Oregon-based North American Wildlife Research Company. Olson's father was the founder of American National Enterprises, a Salt Lake City-based film production company that specialized in nature documentaries. Soundtrack The film's soundtrack is a combination of serene '70s style folk / country (title track 'High in the Mountains') and summer blockbuster style orchestral music. Both are well suited to the scenes they accompany and when combined with the 'authentic' Sasquatch wail used, lend a great deal of atmosphere to the film. The title track, written and performed by Al Capps & Lane Caudell, was available on vinyl 45's for a limited time but has long since gone out of production. Distribution The film was originally released by North American Film Enterprises Inc., and opened in Eugene, Oregon on January 28, 1976, after which it was released on February 13, 1976. Home media Distributors such as RetroMedia, RetroFlix, Image Entertainment and VCI Home Video have re-released it on DVD.

The book, published by Puffin Books in the UK on 16 September 2010, is the second book in a seven-book series, titled The Enemy. The Dead takes place in London, a year before the events in the previous book (The Enemy, released in the UK by Puffin Books on 3 September 2009), two weeks after a worldwide sickness has infected adults turning them into something related to voracious, cannibalistic zombies. Puffin Books released the third novel in the series, titled The Fear, on 15 September 2011; the fourth novel, The Sacrifice, on the 20 September 2012; the fifth novel, The Fallen, on 12 September 2013; the sixth novel, The Hunted, on 4 September 2014; and the final book, The End, on 10 November 2015. Disney Hyperion released Higson's short story companion book in the series, titled Geeks vs. Zombies, on 5 June 2012; it portrays an exclusive scene from The Fear, on World Book Day. Plot The Dead begins a year before the events in The Enemy, where an unnamed user posts a video on Youtube titled \\"The Scared Kid\\". In it, a boy frantically talks to the camera about how his friends Danny and Eve have been killed by \\"Mothers and fathers\\" (Zombies), and shows them standing outside his window. He then suffers a nervous breakdown and ends the video. The video goes viral, with people not knowing if it is real or not. Eventually, the video is taken down from Youtube, followed by the site itself, followed by the internet, and finally electricity entirely. This marks the point that people realized that something bad was going on, and the start of the apocalypse. Two weeks into the apocalypse, two 14-year-old boys, named Jack and Ed are trapped with a group of other schoolboys in the Rowhurst boarding school (in Kent, in a remote village a few miles from London) where they are defending themselves from their now zombified teachers. After escaping from the adult siege of their school with the help of a rugby player named Bam, Jack and Ed rescue their French teacher's daughter, Frederique, and make their way to a nearby chapel, where a group of people led by a boy named Matt barricaded themselves inside a few days prior. Alarmed by the lack of a reply from inside the church, they break in and find that the boys hiding inside have either fallen unconscious or died from carbon monoxide poisoning. The group of boys manage to revive the survivors, and Matt appears to have suffered brain damage from the poisoning. He believes himself to be the messenger of a being called the Lamb, who he explains will come down to earth and cleanse it of \\"Non believers\\" (the zombies). He is convinced he must go to St Paul's Cathedral in London to fulfil the needs of his \\"god\\". The group splits, with Matt and some people he has brought into his religion (now calling themselves his \\"acolytes\\", attempting to go to London with Jack (who wants to find his family home), and the rest (including Ed, Bam and one of Ed's best friends Malik) deciding to go deeper into the countryside (thinking it will be safer). Ed's group is ambushed by older, infected teenagers shortly after parting from the rest, who kill half the group, including Malik. They are saved by the timely arrival of a motor coach driven by an adult named Greg Thorne, a butcher who claims he is immune to the disease. With his young son Liam, Greg has acquired a bus and is collecting children to transport them all to London. He and Liam want to visit Arsenal Stadium, unaware that it is an adult nest (as revealed in The Enemy). On the bus, Ed's group meet three girls, Aleisha, Courtney and Brooke. Brooke immediately develops a crush on Ed, whilst Greg eventually catches up with Jack, Matt, and the Lamb of God believers, who are all still journeying towards London. After finding the others and picking them up, Greg explains that, before the epidemic, he was staying with a farmer and his family, but he had had to kill the father and the older children. He says a younger child, who'd gone crazy after losing his family, \\"didn't make it\\", indirectly revealing that he had killed the boy and made him into the dried meat he was seen eating, but which Liam refused. After a close call where Greg nearly leaves Jack and Frederique behind to a group of zombies, the bus stops for the night on the outskirts of London. Liam finds out that Greg is infected, and knowing that he cannot protect him any more, Greg strangles and kills him. The next morning, Ed finds Greg inexplicably wearing Liam's glasses. Jack and Ed confront Greg about Liam's death. This causes him to succumb to the virus, which is revealed after Jack, who gets mad at the discovery, attempts to disarm a shotgun that Greg is wielding. The arm- to-the-face maneuver that he inflicted causes Greg to lose control, and crash the bus, which he was driving erratically due to succumbing to the disease, and out of anger wanted to get everyone on board to their destination. Afterward, he completely succumbs to the virus and attack the kids, whilst the bus is simultaneously assaulted by several adults. Most of the group escapes from the bus except for a boy Piers who was already injured and makes it to the Imperial War Museum in South London. Greg wanders off into the streets of London, whilst the \\"Bus Party\\" meets the museums's leader, Jordan, and his second in command Dognut (who develops a crush on Brooke). Jordan refuses to let them stay, eventually compromising and letting them stay as long as they collect food for themselves. A group sets off, and they explore until they find a Tesco truck full of non-perishable food, with a partially decomposed corpse inside. Whilst they are attempting to get the truck to run, Frederique is surrounded by several adults. The other kids fight off the adults and are surprised to find that Frederique is unharmed. Whilst they are driving the truck back to the museum, Jack and Bam tell Ed that they are planning on going to Jack's old house (like Jack said before) and hop out to go off on their own. Ed eventually decides to join them, kisses Brooke and catches up with the two boys, unaware that they are being followed by a now fully zombified Greg. Meanwhile, Matt's religion has gained more believers. They rename the religion Agnus Dei (Latin for \\"Lamb of God\\"). Matt foretells that the Lamb will look like a blond boy and will have a darker shadow (another boy, nicknamed \\"The Goat\\"), who must be sacrificed so that \\"The lamb has no shadow\\" and is capable of cleansing the earth. The new religion attempts to make a banner, but the maker misspells Agnus Dei as \\"Angus Day\\", leading to the religion being renamed again. Also at the museum, Frederique attacks a young boy named Froggie, biting into his arm. She reveals that she is 16 years old to Ed, after he meets her, and is infected, but her disease took longer to manifest than it did for others. Several of Jordan's kids lock her in a storeroom. Jack, Ed, and Bam make their way to the Oval Cricket Ground, finding dozens of ambulances, military trucks, police cars, and skips outside filled with dead bodies. Despite Ed's hesitation, Bam and Jack kill two soldiers and an policeman. The boys explore, finding and keeping several weapons. They find that the entire stadium is full of diseased corpses that were stacked to be burned, as well as numerous bodies seated in the stands, but the law enforcement and medical officials were themselves killed or succumbed to the infection before they had a chance to finish the job. The boys learn not all the bodies are dead and are then pursued by adults through the stadium. Jack accidentally shoots a propane tank with a submachine gun whilst trying to fend off an attacker, causing it to explode and setting off an avalanche of corpses. Ed is buried underneath the bodies whilst Jack and Bam are buried underneath the debris resulting from a partially collapsed section of the stadium. Bam mistakes Jack for an adult and shoots him with the shotgun that he had recovered from Greg. Jack is badly wounded in the side, but able to stand. Ed finds them, and the three boys leave, continuing their trek to Jack's house. In the street, they are ambushed by adults whom the three boys manage to kill, but as they do a victory dance for killing the rather large group (as revealed by the book), Greg appears and kills Bam with a meat cleaver to the head. In the book, its noted that Greg was seen before far off, but the boys couldn't identify him. They therefore dismiss him. He then slashes Jack's chest open and cuts the side of Ed's face from forehead to chin. Greg is about to finish off Ed, but Greg flees, wailing with horror when Ed mentions Liam's name aloud, upon seeing that the bundle in Greg's other hand was Liam's body. Ed drags a fading Jack to his home and tries to heal his friend's wounds. However, Jack is beyond repair. Ed takes Jack to his bedroom and keeps him company throughout the night with him. In the morning, Ed finds Jack has died from his injuries. Ed cremates his friend by burning the entire house down, and heads back to the museum under a spreading cloud of smoke and ash emanating from a large fire they'd seen earlier in South London. Soon, Ed is ambushed again by adults, only to be rescued by David and his group (before they took residence at Buckingham Palace). Together, they all travel to the museum. David warns Ed that the fire is spreading northward, towards the museum, and the museum group should relocate. At the museum, Ed manages to stitch his cheek, leaving him with a large scar. He confronts Frederique, who has escaped captivity by gnawing off her own thumb to slip out of her handcuffs. Ed defeats her and, against Jordan's advice to kill her so she won't kill someone else, manages to banish her into the streets. Ed holds council with David and Jordan, with Ed and David deciding to move to North London away from the oncoming fire. Jordan decides to stay in the museum with his original group. Ed and David make a deal: in exchange for receiving food from the Tesco truck, on which Ed's group will ride, David's group will accompany the truck on foot, clearing the congestion and debris blocking the truck's path. Armed with additional weapons from the museum, Ed and David lead their respective kids, and attempt to cross north across the River Thames via the Lambeth Bridge, fleeing the rapidly spreading fire. Every other kid in South London is also trying to cross the river, and they all struggle to do so due to congestion and a commotion between kids further up the bridge. A huge wave of infected adults comes up behind the kids from the south, and Ed and several other fighters including Courtney and Aleisha hang back to fend off the infected whilst Brooke and the others drive on without knowing they are leaving them behind. Brooke decides to split off from David's group after she sees him shoot a boy in the chest. Frederique reappears and attacks Aleisha, injuring her, resulting in Ed shooting Frederique dead with a pistol, after she \\"reverts\\" to human upon recognizing Ed. Ed is helped by another boy named Kyle, and although the fighters initially seem to be overwhelmed, they are rescued by Jordan, Dognut and their his crew, who had been forced to abandon the museum by adults and the fire. The fighters flee, but the way back to the bridge is blocked by a horde of adults. The kids manage to take control of a sightseeing cruise boat moored in the river. They pilot it downstream towards the Tower of London, but Matt hijacks the boat in an attempt to reach St Paul's Cathedral. He accidentally crashes the boat into the bridge, and it splits in half, causing a number of kids to drown, including Aleisha. Matt and his surviving acolytes are last seen disappearing under a bridge, standing on the top of half of the ruined boat, whilst Matt holds the banner above his head. Jordan, Ed, Kyle, and the survivors find lifeboats and navigate them to the river's north bank. They make their way to the Tower of London and enter it by climbing the drainpipes. Inside, they find a group of about 30 kids already inhabiting the castle. Frustrated with the current leader, Jordan takes control, with Ed as his right-hand man. Of the original group from the bus, only Ed and Courtney remain. The others are either dead, missing, or still with the Tesco truck. Greg finds himself in Trafalgar Square, where he has lost his shirt. He puts on a St. George T-shirt from a souvenir stand and decides to get revenge on those he holds responsible for Liam's death. It is also revealed that he intends to raise an army of adults, revealing him as the \\"Saint George\\" adult from the previous novel (The Enemy). One year later, Dognut decides to leave the Tower with a group of people, including Courtney, to search for Brooke and the other kids. A few days after this, Ed, Kyle, and Jordan witness Small Sam and the Kid arrive at the tower (as shown in \\"The Enemy\\"), and are shocked to find that they look identical to the Lamb and the Goat children on the Angus Day banner.

Adults * Greg Thorne/\\"Saint George\\" ‚Äì Liam Thorne's father; he later calls himself \\"Saint George\\". Greg is an adult who claims he is \\"immune\\" to the disease. He is driving a coach bringing Aleisha, Brooke, and Courtney back to England after the disease breaks out on their school trip to France. South of London, he picks up the Rowhurst students and Frederique Morel. Later, he becomes infected, dons a shirt decorated with a St George's Cross, and becomes a leader for infected adults. He serves as the book's main antagonist. * Monsieur Morel ‚Äì A French teacher at Rowhurst, and Frederique's father. When the boys try to escape, he leads the infected teachers to attack them, and captures one of them. Jack kills him by hitting him with a plank of wood with nails sticking out, driving the nails into his skull. Frederique is never told exactly what happened to him, but she is told that he is dead. * Mr. Hewitt ‚Äì An English teacher at Rowhurst. He tries to help the boys in the early stages of the outbreak, until he came down with the sickness (before the beginning of the book). In the beginning, he tries to eat Jack and Ed, but slices open his stomach crawling through a window, and they escape. The boys later find his head (the adults ate his body) while escaping the school, and throw it in a trash can. * Mr. Langston ‚Äì An elderly history teacher at Rowhurst. He pursues the boys and Frederique to the church. As he tries to get the gate open, Jack hits his head with a piece of rebar, and kills him shortly after. * Ms. Warlock ‚Äì An English teacher at Rowhurst. She pursues the boys and Frederique when they go to the church. She remains outside while Mr. Langston tries to open the gate. Bam leaps over the wall and knocks her over, and kills her immediately afterward. * Pez ‚Äì A young infected man whose cheeks have been slashed through, causing his lower jaw to hang down and rendering him unable to bite, also making him look like a living pez dispenser. He first appears with a group of adults attacking the coach after Greg turns on the children. After the kids (sans Piers) escape, he appears among the sickos attacking the scavenging group at Tesco. After they escape again, he is among the adults attacking the kids trying to cross Lambeth Bridge. He attempts to bite Ed, but cannot due to his injuries, and is killed by Kyle. He has dark hair and yellow eyes. Other characters *Dior - Frederique's cat, who she carries with her in the early stages of the book. It was a gift to her father, the French teacher at Rowhurst, and she feels obligated to care for it, to the point where she nearly causes sickos to attack the group by refusing to abandon it. She later releases Dior after they reach the Imperial War museum, believing the cat will be better off on its own. *Kyle ‚Äì A boy Ed meets during the battle on the bridge. Kyle joins Ed's trek through London and serves as his right-hand man at the Tower of London. *Tomoki - The unofficial leader of the Tower of London group, when Ed and the survivors from the tour boat arrive. His position is taken by Jordan, who is a more effective leader, though Tomoki is allowed to continue representing his group. Cultural, historical, and geographical elements Part of the appeal of The Dead, as with Higson's other books, stems from the author's inclusion of accurate geographic details (e.g., the locations of and attractions surrounding various Tesco stores; Jack, Ed, and Bam's trek from the Imperial War Museum to The Oval; the trek of Ed's \\"bus party\\" and David King's group from the Imperial War Museum to the Lambeth Bridge); descriptions of various sites and historic events, e.g., the Great Fire of London (1666); and references to popular culture, e.g., the Gormenghast series).

The season begins with the new secretary, Peggy Olson, starting her first day with the firm. As the season unfolds, the mysterious backstory of enigmatic ad man Don Draper is revealed as is the growing confidence and success of Peggy Olson. The first season was highly praised for its excellence in writing, acting, and art design, as well as for its faithfulness to the era it depicted. It was acknowledged with numerous honors from industry awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series, and a Peabody Award.

They both work at the small but prestigious agency Sterling Cooper. Though Don is welcoming towards her, Peggy is subject to passive-aggressive hostility from office manager Joan Holloway and sexual harassment from her male colleagues. Junior accounts manager Pete Campbell, who is about to get married, takes a liking to Peggy and the two have sex the night of his bachelor party. Don, meanwhile, has trouble balancing his life as he cheats on his wife, Betty Draper, with a beatnik artist named Midge Daniels. Roger Sterling, the acerbic son of one of Sterling Cooper's founding partners, cheats on his wife, Mona, with Joan, with whom he is enamored. Sterling Cooper begins working for the 1960 Nixon presidential campaign, gratis and unbidden, as they believe Nixon's success will benefit their business. They are also working to reassure their largest client, Lucky Strike, whose account is the firm's bread and butter, in the face of resurgent medical research demonstrating smoking is harmful and related lawsuits and impending legislation harmful to the tobacco industry. Betty begins seeing a psychiatrist after her numb and shaking hands cause her to crash the family car. Don, initially resistant to the idea of psychotherapy, allows Betty to seek help. Behind Betty's back, Don has Betty's doctor report back to Don what Betty says in treatment. Meanwhile, Don begins a flirtatious relationship with Rachel Menken, the Jewish owner of a department store who seeks marketing help at Sterling Cooper. Don also has to deal with the arrival of his younger brother, Adam Whitman, who refers to Don as \\"Dick Whitman\\". Don gives Adam $5,000 and tells him to make a new life for himself, as Don did, and to never contact Don again. Flashbacks to Don's childhood as \\"Dick Whitman\\", during the Great Depression, depict Dick's relationships with his unloving, pious stepmother, who calls him a \\"whore- child\\", and abusive father Archibald Whitman, who cheats a hobo out of promised payment for performing chores. Dick had grown friendly with the vagrant, and the incident further degrades his image of his father. Additionally, the vagrant teaches young Dick the hobo code, which communicates important messages via simple visual symbols. Don finds a weathered hobo sign indicating Don's father is a dishonest man. Peggy begins writing copy after ad man Freddy Rumsen recognizes her talent. She is soon given control of her own account, creating a campaign for a weight loss machine. Peggy's work on the weight loss machine coincides with her own weight gain. Roger suffers two heart attacks, drastically changing his outlook on life, and prompting Lucky Strike's owner, Lee Garner, Sr., to warn Bert Cooper that keeping Lucky Strike's account requires Sterling Cooper to do something to \\"show Don Sterling Cooper appreciates him\\". Bert then offers Don a partnership, with a 12% share of the business (without Don having to pay a partnership fee). Don accepts, provided he's not required to sign a contract; an amused Bert agrees, and acknowledges Don's attitude calls back to Ayn Rand's philosophy, as expressed in the book Bert had earlier urged Don to read: Atlas Shrugged. Don's first order of business is to appoint a new head of accounts (to lighten Roger's load as partner and rainmaker), and Don begins interviewing external candidates (to Pete's chagrin). The most promising candidate proves to be Herman \\"Duck\\" Phillips, who \\"landed American Airlines\\", but is looking for a job after alcoholism and an extramarital affair ended his career at Y&R;'s London office. After the partners leave for the day, the Sterling Cooper ad men throw a raucous party the night of the 1960 presidential election, but see their client and preferred choice, Richard Nixon, defeated. Further flashbacks revolve around Dick Whitman's origin story in the Korean War, in which he is put under the command of a Lieutenant Donald Draper, who is soon to be sent home. After an attack, an accidental explosion kills Draper and injures Whitman. Whitman switches dog tags with his lieutenant and assumes Draper's identity as a way to escape the war. The Army has \\"Draper\\" take Whitman's body back to Whitman's family. The coffin is dropped off by train, and Whitman does not exit to greet his family, but a young Adam sees Whitman standing inside the train. Adam's parents dismiss his entreaties that, \\"I see Dick on the train\\". A female train passenger notices Whitman's look of grief and tells him to \\"forget that boy in the box\\". Whitman then turns his back on his family and begins his new life as \\"Donald Draper\\". Pete, who has demonstrated a propensity to snoop, expresses the belief that he should be promoted to head of accounts and throws his hat in the ring. He has also revealed his jealousy about Peggy and Don's success and sits at Don's desk after the two have left for the day. The mailroom boy mistakes Pete for Don and delivers a package from Adam Whitman filled with Dick Whitman's dog tags and childhood photographs. (Adam posted the package immediately before hanging himself in his hotel room). Pete confronts Don with the information that he knows \\"Don\\"'s real name is Dick Whitman and attempts to blackmail him for a promotion. Don neutralizes the threat by telling Bert, \\"I've pulled the trigger on hiring Duck Phillips\\", which he knew would incite Pete to reveal Don's true identity to Bert. Pete tells Bert that Don is a deserter who isn't who he says he is, and Bert brushes it off with, \\"Who cares?\\" After Pete leaves the room, Bert gives Don the option to either fire Pete or keep a close eye on him, as one never knows what spawns loyalty. Peggy seeks medical care for severe stomach pain. The doctor quickly realizes Peggy's weight gain is a result of a pregnancy; she was impregnated by Pete Campbell. After the child is delivered, the nurse encourages Peggy to hold the baby, but Peggy refuses. The season ends just before Thanksgiving 1960, as Betty and Don bicker over Don's lack of interest in attending Thanksgiving dinner with Betty's family. Don cites his workload as his reason to stay home. Soon afterwards, Betty discovers Don was receiving calls from her psychiatrist, who was reporting on her sessions to Don. Don also learns that his brother Adam has hanged himself. Don subsequently makes a new campaign presentation for the Kodak Carousel that revolves around the \\"power of nostalgia\\". During a train ride, Don has a vision of returning home to announce he will be joining the family for Thanksgiving. Instead, Don returns home to find the house dark and empty. He sits alone at the bottom of the staircase as the season closes. EpisodesProduction=Filming The pilot episode was shot at Silvercup Studios and various locations around New York City; subsequent episodes have been filmed at Los Angeles Center Studios. It is available in high definition for showing on AMC-HD and on video-on-demand services available from various cable affiliates. The writers, including Weiner, amassed volumes of research on the period in which Mad Men takes place so as to make most aspects of the series‚Äîincluding detailed set designs, costume design, and props‚Äîhistorically accurate, producing an authentic visual style that garnered critical praise. Each episode has a budget of $2‚Äì2.5 million, though the pilot episode's budget was over $3 million. On the scenes featuring smoking, Weiner stated: \\"Doing this show without smoking would've been a joke. It would've been sanitary and it would've been phony.\\" Since the actors cannot, by California law, smoke tobacco cigarettes in their workplace, they instead smoke herbal cigarettes. Crew In addition to having created the series, Matthew Weiner is the showrunner, head writer, and an executive producer; he contributes to each episode‚Äîwriting or co-writing the scripts, casting various roles, and approving costume and set designs. He is notorious for being selective about all aspects of the series, and promotes a high level of secrecy around production details. Along with Matthew Weiner, the writing staff of the first season consisted of co-executive producer Tom Palmer, who wrote two episodes; producer Lisa Albert, who wrote two episodes; producers and writing team Andre and Maria Jacquemetton, who wrote three episodes; writer's assistant Robin Veith, who wrote two episodes; and freelance writers Bridget Bedard and Chris Provenzano, who each wrote two episodes. Other producers included co-producer Blake McCormick, producer Todd London, and co-executive producer Scott Hornbacher. Primary directors of the first season were Tim Hunter, who directed four episodes, and Alan Taylor, who directed three including the pilot episode. The remaining episodes were directed by Ed Bianchi, Lesli Linka Glatter, Andrew Bernstein, series cinematographer Phil Abraham, Paul Feig, and series creator Matthew Weiner, who directs each season finale.  Reception = Ratings  The premiere episode, which aired at 10:00 p.m. on July 19, 2007, was rated higher than any other AMC original series at the time, and attained a 1.4 household rating (1.2 million households). The season averaged 900,000 viewers.  Critical reception The first season of Mad Men received generally favorable reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of 30 critics have given the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"Oozing evocative early 1960s ambiance, Mad Men is a sly, subversive look at the American workplace that radiates class, wit, and an undercurrent of disaffection.\\" On Metacritic, the first season scored 77 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said each episode \\"unfolded like a small movie\\", calling it \\"one of the best character studies anyone has put on television in some time ‚Äì an adult drama of introspection and the inconvenience of modernity in a man's world.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today said the show \\"hopes to come to grips with both what was lost and what has been gained since generation gaps, sexual revolutions, racial divides and Vietnam blasted the '60s apart\\" and called it a \\"smart, complex drama\\". The New York Times called it \\"both a drama and a comedy and all the better for it, a series that breaks new ground by luxuriating in the not-so-distant past.\\" DVD Talk writer Adam Tyner described the season as \\"virtually flawless\\", praising the depth with which each of the characters has been written. Andrew Johnson praised the initial episode in Time Out New York stating: \\"Inspired by cynical Eisenhower-era comedies of manners (Sweet Smell of Success, The Apartment) and the stories of John Cheever, frequent Sopranos writer Matthew Weiner's Mad Men is a scathing chronicle of the ad industry‚Äôs boozy midcentury heyday, and one of the freshest series to hit basic cable in years.\\" Varietys reaction to the first season was more mixed, commenting that \\"as a serialized drama, the program's situations aren't especially stirring, even with its solid, perfectly outfitted cast. The sheer atmosphere, however, proves intoxicating.\\" Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote a negative review, stating that \\"the stories unfold in a dry, drab way and the pacing is desultory. Series directors are fond of long pauses that serve no purpose other than to give the impression that an actor forgot his next line.\\"  Accolades  The first season of Mad Men was nominated for and won numerous industry awards, including fifteen Emmy nominations and six Emmy wins. At the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, Mad Men won Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series (Matthew Weiner for \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\"). The series also won Creative Arts Emmys for Art Direction, Cinematography, Hairstyling, and Main Title Design. The series also received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Jon Hamm), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (John Slattery), Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series (Robert Morse), Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series (Alan Taylor), again for \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\") and a second nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series (Weiner and Robin Veith, for \\"The Wheel\\"). Mad Men won a Peabody Award for Outstanding Achievement in Television for the first season in 2007. AMC Executive Vice President Charles Collier called the award an \\"incredible honor\\". The first season was also honored by the American Film Institute as one of the ten greatest television achievements of 2007, called it brilliant for depicting \\"the discomfort that hides in the dark corners of nostalgia\\", and said \\"The show's extraordinary writing, characterizations and art direction neatly package a time filtered through the haze of cigarettes and sexism, but the message is for today ‚Äî that those who sell a way of life are often mad for a world that is not their own.\\" The series won Best Television Drama Series at the 65th Golden Globe Awards, while Jon Hamm won Best Actor ‚Äì Television Series Drama. \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" also won a Casting Society of America Artios Award for Outstanding Casting in a Television Pilot, Drama.

Life Pike was born about 1717 at \\"Ramsey, Wiltshire\\" (Wilson), which may mean Ramsbury, Wiltshire, or Romsey, Hampshire . He was educated for the independent ministry, receiving his general training from John Eames of the Congregational Fund academy, and his theology from John Hubbard at Stepney Academy. His first settlement was at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, about 1740. He moved in 1747 to succeed John Hill (1711‚Äì1746) as pastor at the Three Cranes meeting-house in Fruiterers Alley, Thames Street, London. Early in his London ministry Pike established, in his house on Hoxton Square, an academy for training students for the ministry. He adopted the principles of John Hutchinson (1674‚Äì1737), and defended them (1753) in a long work. In 1754 he succeeded Zephaniah Marryat, D.D. (1684?‚Äì1754), as one of the Tuesday lecturers at Pinners' Hall. About the same time he joined Samuel Hayward (1718‚Äì1757), independent minister at Silver Street, Wood Street, Cheapside, in a Sunday-evening lecture, dealing with \\"cases of conscience\\", at Little St. Helen's Church, Bishopsgate Street. His Body of Divinity (1755) was criticised by Caleb Fleming. Religious views In 1757 Pike became acquainted with the views of Robert Sandeman, the son-in-law and disciple of John Glas. Sandeman had published (1757) a series of Letters dealing with the Dialogues between Theron and Aspasio (1755), by James Hervey (1714‚Äì1758). The Letters were admired by members of Pike's church; and Pike, on reading them, began (17 January 1758) a correspondence with Sandeman, then in Edinburgh. The correspondence, as it proceeded, was communicated to Pike's church, with the result that he, and a section of his people, came gradually into Sandeman's views; while others showed such dissatisfaction that Pike ceased the correspondence, suppressing his fourth letter. He began, however, to adopt Glassite or Sandemanian usages, including a weekly communion. This led (August 1758) to rumours of his unsoundness; his discourses at Pinners' Hall gave offence, and he was excluded from the lectureship in 1759 by forty-four votes to one, Dr. John Conder being chosen to succeed him on 3 Oct. In his own church he was hotly opposed by William Fuller and Thomas Uffington. A church meeting (9 October 1759) came to no conclusion; church meetings on 13 January and 21 April 1760 were equally divided (seventeen votes on either side), but Pike's casting vote carried the exclusion of the malcontents, who formed a new church under Joseph Barber. Disputes then arose about possession of church property, and a lawsuit was begun (1761) by Pike for recovery of an endowment of ¬£12 a year. At length he resigned his charge (14 December 1765), left the independents, and became a member of the Sandemanian church in Bull and Mouth Street, St. Martin's Le Grand. He was chosen \\"elder\\" in 1766, and ministered with great acceptance. From London, Pike moved in 1771 to minister to a Sandemanian congregation at Trowbridge, Wiltshire. Unfounded reports were spread of his insobriety. Pike was a follower of the doctrines of Hutchinson, who found in scripture a system of physical science, and then became a follower of Glas, who held that biblical authority did not extend to such topics. He died at Trowbridge in January 1773, and was buried on 10 January in the parish churchyard. His portrait, engraved by Hopwood, is given in Wilson. He was married, and left children. Works He published, besides single sermons (1748‚Äì53): * Philosophia Sacra ... Natural Philosophy.

Since its inception in 1896, the institution grew in prominence resulting in its successful affiliation with the University of Zagreb in 1979, along with the Academy of Music and the Academy of Fine Arts. The Academy serves as the country's premier drama school, providing education for all types of professions related to theatre, radio, television and film production, including actors, directors, cinematographers and editors.  History  Academy of Dramatic Art The need for an academy of drama in Zagreb was first mentioned in the Croatian parliament's 1861 piece of theatre legislation which stipulated that a \\"school for theatre personnel should be formed in Zagreb\\". However, the modern-day academy traces its roots to the Croatian Drama School (') which was established by Stjepan Miletiƒá in 1896, more than 30 years after the 1861 law. The school was housed in a building at Republic of Croatia Square, which it occupies today. During its history the school was renamed and reformed several times. Up until mid-20th century, its primary role was vocational training of theatre actors. Later, departments for film and television were added. In November 1950, the school was legally recognized as a higher education institution, mainly through the efforts of Branko Gavella, Drago Ivani≈°eviƒá and Ranko Marinkoviƒá, prompting a rename to \\"academy\\". In 1979, it officially became part of the University of Zagreb. During the Croatian War of Independence, in the Zagreb rocket attacks on 3 May 1995, the Academy's building was hit by cluster bombs fired on Zagreb's city centre (Donji grad). The dean's office and the dramaturgy department offices were badly damaged in the attack and two employees and four students were wounded, including Luka Skraƒçiƒá, a first-year student of film directing, who later died. In memory of this event, the Academy officially proclaimed 3 May as Academy Day and a plaque commemorating the attack was unveiled on its 10th anniversary in 2005. In the period between 1950 and 1994 a total of 574 students have graduated from the Academy's departments. The Academy is also member of various international associations such as CILECT (Centre International de Liaison des Ecoles de Cin√©ma et de T√©l√©vision), IIRT (Instituto Internationale per la Ricerca Teatrale), IFIRT (International Federation for Theatre Research) and ELIA (European League of Institutes of the Arts).  Organisation  As of 2010 the academy has seven departments: *Acting department *Theatre and radio directing department *Film and television directing department *Cinematography department *Dramaturgy department *Production department  Rectors and Deans  Between 1950 and 1979 the head of the Academy was titled \\"Rector\\" (Rektor) as it had been an independent learning institution.

Having initially performed individually at these events, the pair soon began collaborating as a duo and quickly found an idiosyncratic-yet- natural niche: euphoric, folk-tinged pop music. The name 'Over The Wall' was taken from a now-defunct fanzine of Prentice's favoured football team Albion Rovers. Over The Wall's sound is influenced by a range of different artists and genres. Prentice told The Scotsman: \\"Ben and I first bonded over classic pop songwriting. Stuff like Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, early Tom Waits and The Beatles were the things that brought us together.\\" Former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel is also an inspiration to the pair. Prentice has also gone on record as saying the aim of the Over The Wall 'experience' is to induce \\"Euphoria, the same euphoria you get from a trance compilation or any given chart hit but hopefully presented in a more thoughtful package.\\" Lyrically, the band has traversed a diverse range of topics and themes, including getting older, finding your place in the world, body image, and political history - often displaying chagrin at the influence of Margaret Thatcher's premiership. The song \\"Istanbul\\" explores the effect of the half-time team talk given by then Liverpool F.C. manager Rafael Benitez during the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, while \\"The Crucible\\" is a fictional story about the wife of a philandering snooker player, set in Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Early history From the group's early days, praise and support came from broadcaster and DJ Vic Galloway, leading to frequent airplay on his BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio Scotland shows. BBC Radio 6 Music presenters Steve Lamacq and Tom Robinson also gave regular exposure to the band's music, the latter hosting live sessions and interviews with the duo on his show. In 2007 the group was selected from over 1,200 unsigned acts to perform at Scotland's largest music festival, T In The Park. In 2008 they beat off competition from 800 hopefuls to secure a slot at the End Of The Road Festival in Dorset, England. The band previously shared management with We Were Promised Jetpacks, with whom they also played numerous live shows. Album release The band released their debut album Treacherous in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2010, on Motive Sounds Recordings. The album received positive reviews and fanfare, with This Is Fake DIY describing it as \\"...one of the more stunning albums of the year\\". The Skinny hailed the album's \\"...impressively imaginitive variety\\", awarding it a 4-out-of-5 rating. Treacherous was supported with a video for the final track, live set-closing fans' favourite \\"Thurso\\". It was filmed, directed and produced by Red Design in Brighton during Over The Wall's 2009 nationwide tour. In early 2011, the band embarked on another lengthy jaunt across the UK and Ireland. In mid-March, \\"Shifts\\" (the opening track from Treacherous) was featured in the finale of the fifth series of Skins on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Later that month, the second series of critically acclaimed BBC 1 Scotland comedy series Burnistoun aired with \\"Thurso\\" as its new theme tune. Further television exposure came in January 2012, when the track \\"A Grand Defeat\\" (from The Rise and Fall of Over The Wall EP) was used in the Scottish Government's 'Let's Go Greener Together' television campaign to promote more environmentally-conscious behaviour in Scotland. Hiatus and other projects 2012 was spent mainly on hiatus. As Hillman focused on academic endeavours, Prentice recorded and released his first solo album The Invisible Hand through the Instinctive Racoon label, and ventured out on the road in a support slot on the Scottish tour of We Were Promised Jetpacks. In early 2013 Prentice co-devised and performed in Rantin', a song-based storytelling production with writer/performers Kieran Hurley and Julia Taudevin, and fellow musician Drew Wright (a.k.a. Wounded Knee) for the National Theatre of Scotland. The well-received initial performances of the show were part of the Arches Behaviour Festival programme. Return and further releases In March 2013 the band announced their long-awaited live comeback - a show at Glasgow's √íran M√≥r on 21 June. Later in the year saw two releases, beginning with new track \\"Tell Her I Love Her\\" on a split single with fellow Glasgow band John Knox Sex Club in October. Hot on the heels of this came the unleashing of This Is How We Did It in physical and digital forms, an EP which included live staple \\"Radiator\\". Disbandment On Friday 28 February 2014, a posting on popular social media network Facebook confirmed the news that Over The Wall would disband following two final live shows in May 2014. Prentice has subsequently released music with his new outfit ULTRAS, with whom he continues to tour and record.

At Ystad, the line connects with the √ñsterlen Line, which continues onwards to Simrishamn. History Plans for a railway between Malm√∂ and Ystad were first launched in the 1860s, and in 1872 a railway company was established to build the line. Because the region was regarded as sufficiently wealthy to finance its own infrastructure, the line received no state grants. During part of the planning phase, the line was proposed to be narrow gauge, but this was changed to standard gauge after sufficient funding was granted by Julius Stjernblad. Construction started in 1872 and the line was finished in December 1874. Because of the many nobles who had financed the line, it was originally known as the Count Line (). Because of the private financing, each manor received their own station, resulting in many stations and slow service. The original speed limit on the line was , giving a travel time of three hours from Malm√∂ to Ystad. At Ystad, the line connected to the √ñsterlen Line, which had opened in 1965. The two lines were merged into a common operating company, Ystads J√§rnv√§gar. The Ystad Line was nationalized in 1941. Diesel multiple units were taken into use in the 1950s. In 1955, the line through Malm√∂ was moved, so instead of operating out of Malm√∂ West Station via S√∂derv√§rn, the line connected to the Continental Line. The last steam train ran in 1962. During the 1960s and 1970s, several of the smaller stations, including all the manor station, were closed. The line was moved in 1973 to run via Fosieby and the following year, the train ferry between Ystad and Swinoujscie in Poland opened, and the line received a large increase in freight trains. The line was electrified during the 1990s, and the first electricity-powered train ran across the tracks on 8 June 1996. The electrification resulted in increased traffic, and in 2003 a new passing loop was built at Rydsg√•rd to allow increased traffic. Service The line has mixed passenger and freight traffic. The Sk√•ne Commuter Rail operates a half- hour headway along the line using X11 trains, with some of the services continuing along the √ñsterlen Line. DSB used to operate three daily InterCity Bornholm trains from Copenhagen Central Station until 9 December 2017, which connected with BornholmerF√¶rgen to reach the Danish island of Bornholm. In addition, Green Cargo operates freight trains. The line has been proposed as part of the link between Bornholm and Copenhagen, should the Bornholm Tunnel be built.

Life Salmon was born at Oxford in 1787, her father was named Munday and had a musical background. Her mother's brothers, John Mahon (b. 1746) and William Mahon (1753‚Äì1816), were noted clarinettists. Their sisters (Eliza's aunts), Mrs. Warton, Mrs. Ambrose, and Mrs. Second (1777‚Äì1805), were excellent vocalists. Mrs. Second sang at the Three Choirs Festival in 1795, and at the Royal Opera House in 1796. Her voice was of rare quality, and she \\"sang up to F in alt with ease\\" (Parke). Eliza Munday became a pupil of John James Ashley. On 4 March 1803 she made her first appearance in oratorio at Covent Garden, Miss Stephens having at that period the first place as a singer. The young Munday, gifted with a voice of beautiful tone, a charming manner, and a face \\"of dazzling fairness,\\" obtained immediate success; but her attempt to embellish her solo singing with inappropriate tricks was condemned by critics. After acquiring further experience Eliza Munday learnt to employ her executive powers more judiciously. She married, at Liverpool on 11 Feb. 1806, James Salmon, organist of St. Peter's, Liverpool, whose father, James Salmon the elder (d. 1827), was lay clerk of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and whose brother William (1789‚Äì1858), after holding the same position, was lay clerk of Westminster and taught singing. In 1813 her husband enlisted and went to the West Indies with his regiment, where he died. Mrs. Salmon sang constantly at the Three Choirs Festivals from 1812 until 1824, and was soon deemed indispensable at oratorios and concerts in London. So numerous were her engagements that she had been known, in those days of difficult journeys, to travel some four hundred miles in six days, appearing at the large towns on the way. Her professional income during 1823 is said to have reached 5,000l. Suddenly, in a moment it was even said, during an Ancient music concert at the beginning of May 1825, Mrs. Salmon's voice collapsed. Her husband died before her voice failed. During her widowhood she sought for pupils, but in vain. She married for a second time a clergyman named Hinde, who died about 1840, leaving her destitute. After several years of poverty she died, aged 62, at 33 King's Road, Chelsea, on 5 June 1849. The magic of Mrs. Salmon's voice lay in its tone. It was likened by several critics to that of musical glasses. A critic in the Quarterly Musical Magazine, probably Richard Mackenzie Bacon, wrote in 1823 that \\"When I hear such a singer as Miss Stephens or Mrs. Salmon, the power of ductility seems carried to its utmost. There are no roughnesses, no breaks--the metal is drawn out exactly, and if we could run it along between the finger and the thumb, or pass the nail over the surface, it would be as even, as smooth, and as polished to the touch as it is brilliant to the ear.\\" This description rules out any possibility of vibrato. Henry Phillips wrote that when Thomas Lindsay Willman, the clarinettist, accompanied Mrs. Salmon, it was difficult at times to distinguish the voice from the instrument. But Mrs. Salmon was no musician, although perfectly drilled into everything the orchestra then required. She gave no character to anything she sang.

Its name derives from the Dutch word Mooiland which means \\"beautiful country\\". The name was probably coined by Dutch workers, whom the then-leaseholder Jacob van den Eger of the Lower Rhine brought to the property in 1307 to drain the surrounding wetlands. The building is now primarily a museum devoted to exhibiting the world's largest collection of work by artist Joseph Beuys. It is a popular destination on the Lower Rhine.Fritz Getlinger, Matthias Gra√ü: Schloss Moyland. Zerst√∂rung und Wiederaufbau. Keuck, Geldern 1997. Gregor Spor: Wie sch√∂n, hier zu vertr√§umen.

Description = Castle  Moyland Castle, view from the south (March 2005) The palace complex consists of a closed, four-towered main keep, which is southeast of farm buildings in the front. The latter is home to a museum caf√©, museum administration, the library and a space for changing exhibitions. The two- story main building of brick is presented in historicist Tudor style with battlements on corbels . The four floors of the former donjon on the southeast corner of the main keep were in 2008 crowned by a polygonal lantern roof. On the three other corners of the castle are horseshoe-shaped towers with three floors. The southeast wall of the castle has a gateway formed by two polygonal towers outside with Pointed roofs and flanked by two slender round towers. On the first floor of the wing is the so-called Zwirner Hall, used for concerts and other events.Ferdinand G. B. Fischer: Ausflugsziele am Niederrhein. Sch√∂ne Burgen, Schl√∂sser und Motten. Peter Pomp, Bottrop 2000, S. 12‚Äì15.  The characters of the staircase  The stair railing on the stairway to the portal of the main palace are decorated with various animal figures. At the upper end are two lions - they are older originals. At the lower ends of the railing, the original lions were replaced by a wolf on the right and a pug on the left. The wolf was to commemorate the visit of Voltaire . The figure was selected to record for posterity the \\"ferocity\\" of the French philosopher in discussion with Frederick II. The pug represents Sir Winston Churchill. During World War II, he attended Moyland Castle in the wake of observing Operation Plunder - the Rhine crossing of the British Army. He was one of the last to visit the intact 200-year-old fortress in which the King of Prussia and Voltaire had their discussions. Shortly after Churchill's visit, the palace was looted and the interior largely destroyed.  Castle Park  Castle Moyland Bridge In the period from July 1995 to May 1997 the park was restored under the leadership of Gustav and Rose Woerner of Castle Park, together with the old stand of trees and oak trees and avenues of trees, so that today the appearance reflects the late 19th and early 20th Century. The original architect is not known, but the designs were created in the 1830s/1840s for the family Steengracht. Today, the park features sculptures by contemporary artists from around the world, including James Lee Byars, U We Claus, Hans Karl Burgeff, Eduardo Chillida, Huub Kortekaas, Kubach-Wilmsen, Josef Jaekel, Heinz Mack, Gerhard Marcks, Holger Runge and Antoni T√†pies.Karl-Heinz Hohmann, Rose und Gustav W√∂rner: Museum Schloss Moyland und sein Park in Bedburg-Hau (Kreis Kleve).

In that year the priest and later Archdeacon of Li√®ge, Jacob van den Eger accepted the investment of Count Otto von Kleve in annual lease . The teacher then later called the children of the count \\"of Moyland\\". 15 years later the estate was purchased from Roland von Hagedorn by Dietrich VIII von Kleve who also renewed the fief in 1339. The relevant instrument is the first time that Castle Moyland is documented. .A. Wemmers, J. Wroblewski: Theiss-Burgenf√ºhrer Niederrhein, S. 110. Alexander von Spaen was lord of the manor from 1662 Until the second half of the 17th Century there followed frequent changes of ownership inheritance, which ended in 1662, when the Brandenburg Field Marshal Alexander von Spaen purchased the fief. His descendant Wilhelm von Spaen sold the now a rebuilt castle in 1695 to the then Brandenburg electors, and later Prussian King Friedrich I. He used Moyland primarily as a hunting lodge, and also as a love nest. His affair with the 17-year-old Emmericher citizen's daughter Katharina Rycker was made mention of at the Prussian court.Alexander Duncker: Die l√§ndlichen Wohnsitze, Schl√∂sser und Residenzen der ritterschaftlichen Grundbesitzer in der preu√üischen Monarchie nebst den k√∂niglichen Familien-, Haus-, Fideicommiss- und Schattull-G√ºtern. Bd. 9, Berlin 1866/67, (PDF; 223 KB). In 1740 during one of his many stays in the castle the Prussian King Frederick II met with the philosopher Voltaire. Together they developed the idea of \\"Truth Factory\\", a philosopher Academy, which should be set up at the Castle Moyland.Otto Br√ºes, Guido de Werd, Alois Puyn: Schloss Moyland. Von Voltaire bis Beuys. Mercator Duisburg 1988. (= Niederrhein erleben.) In 1766 the estate came into the possession of the Dutch family Steengracht when Adriaan Steengracht received the castle as compensation for loans made to the Prussian royal family in the Seven Years' War. Moyland remained in a possession within the Steengracht family until 11 July 1990 when the Castle Moyland Museum Foundation was formed with the objective of rebuilding the facility for use as a museum. The owners had long been seeking suitable funding for a rebuild. The decisive impetus for the creation of the Foundation in 1987 was provided by the brothers Franz Joseph van der Grinten and Hans van der Grinten who were looking for a site for their private collection of modern art. On 24 May 1997 the completely renovated buildings and the gardens were reopened.Stephan de Lange (Hrsg.): Chronik Schloss Moyland. Boss, Kleve 2001.  Building history  The former fortified farm was in 1345 to 1355 redesigned by Roland von Hagedorn into a classical gothic castle with a square floor plan. In addition to three round towers it had on the north corner of a more powerful, fourth round tower, which served as a dungeon. From the interior courtyard the third tower was accessible and provided all sorts of comforts, such as a well, toilet, light niches and a fireplace. The western side of the castle was at that time, a great hall, the other sides consisted of walls with battlements. South of the main castle was a bailey, the castle gate through which the main castle was reached. In the 15th century in the courtyard of the main castle building new wings were built and a decorated chapel was added in the east tower. Moyland Castle in 1746 Alexander Baron von Spaen had the medieval fortifications expanded and rebuilt in 1662 as a baroque castle styled like the buildings from the capital city of Kleve by Pieter Post. Since only a year before the renovation work at Castle Ringberg was completed you can still today see architectural parallels between the two castles. The basement rooms received new, concave sides and the floor heights were changed. Also the windows of the main castle windows were arranged symmetrically and the approaching roads were moved so that they leads axially towards the main house. Under Johann Nikolaus von Steengracht from 1854 to 1862 a remodeling of the exterior was done in the Gothic Revival style. The Baroque interior was maintained largely untouched during the work under the Cologne Cathedral architect Ernst Friedrich Zwirner. The castle walls were covered with red brick and the three corner towers were fitted with battlements and pointed windows. The keep was set up with a historicist pointed roof. The gateway also experienced a reorganization and was made accessible via a newly built stone bridge. In the course of this work, the fore-castle was rebuilt on the foundation of its predecessor. Moyland Castle in Lithograph from the collection of Alexander Duncker In addition, the builder replanted the parks in the \\"mixed style\\" of that time. In this can be found in the style of an English landscape garden and baroque structures typical of the so-called \\"architectural garden\\". Because of their importance, the park was in 2004 added to the tourist route Strasse der Gardenkunst (road of garden art). The castle survived the last battles of the Second World War relatively unscathed, until the arrival of the Allies on February 25, 1945. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery took the castle as his headquarters. In this period Winston Churchill also came to Moyland. After they left almost all of the sumptuous interior went through theft and vandalism by Canadian soldiers, and the castle was devastated. The castle's owner Gustav Adolf Steengracht von Moyland was Ribbentrop's state secretary and was tried for war crimes by the Americans, but in January 1950 he was given an amnesty and freed. A temporary repair was done in 1954 but a fire in the western roof truss in 1956 caused damage, so that the buildings gradually fell into disrepair, despite a temporary roof. 1987 began with repairs to restore the buildings. From 1990 to 1997 the newly formed Foundation Museum Schloss Moyland had responsibility for the restoration and extension of the historic buildings and a modern redesign of the rooms of the interior for use as a museum.  The Museum  The castle buildings now house the art collection of the brothers Hans van der Grinten and Franz Joseph van der Grinten, collected over 50 years. The extensive collection includes exhibits from the 19th and 20th Century, including works by Erwin Heerich, Willem den Ouden, Rudolf Schoofs and Hermann Teuber.Karl Ebbers, Bettina Paust, Florian Monheim (Red.): Museum Schloss Moyland.

Since 2003, its development has been led by the initiator of the \\"hobby\\" project, Jirko Cernik. In total there are 14 to 17 different servershttp://www.freewar.de/ worlds, an international, English-language servers, the RPG World and Action Freewar. and more than 100,000 registered accounts. Freewar is one of the most popular German browser-based games. The game is set in a medieval fantasy world. It is similar to Darkfleet, which is set in the same universe but occurs 10,000 years later. The game is available in two languages, German and English. Game worlds The game, designed in the fantasy style, consists of a variety of landscapes in a virtual world with names like Konlir or Lorania. Players gradually move from room to room on a card made up of square boxes. Players can fight against other players (called \\"player vs. player,\\" or PVP) or non-player characters. They fight, gain experience, and earn gold for solving quests. Characters can buy, use, sell, and trade weapons. Special features Freewar runs in real-time. Players may either simulate travelling the world (for example, as a trader, fighter, or tissue researcher) or stay in residence (for example, as a stockbroker). Characters could learn skills that will enable them to pay for certain services such as more gold received for completed orders. Players can join or organize clans‚Äîsmall groups in order to defeat stronger enemies. In the game, there are buildings with special features, such as an auction hall, stock exchange, market hall, stores with varying prices, and buildings that regularly produce raw materials. Game chat is integrated into various \\"channels\\". One can communicate internally within a clan, converse with another player on the same field, or talk to people on their friend lists. In the 2007 vote for \\"super browser game\\" organized by Games Dynamite, Freewar was awarded second place in the Big Browser Games category, which includes games of more than 10,000 players. Costs Registration and participation are free-to-play. Through 'Sponsorship' at a cost of ‚Ç¨10 per 120 days of playtime, special features can be purchased. Examples of this include a queue for the time-based nature of learning skills, the possibility to change into a different race, or the ability to change the player's nickname and gender. It is also possible to purchase sponsorship for other players by using virtual currency. The operator places a high value on granting no benefits to sponsors, such as obtaining higher attack values. Variants In addition to the traditional game, there is an RPG World (often abbreviated to RP) with special rules. Moderators enforce special rules, involving things like names that could disrupt the role-playing experience or speaking only in-character without reference to real life. The moderators or \\"guards\\" of this world provide people with unique quests to ensure that the well-known pen-and-paper RPG-style quests must be solved by the players. This is different from tasks in other worlds in terms of duration, content, and rewards. The RPG world is unlike the standard version of the game. Additionally, there is a world for Freewar called Action Freewar (commonly shortened to AF). This world is reset every five months. It is different from the normal Freewar world in that it has a higher respawn rate of NPCs. Also, more money is accumulated from killing these enemies. Name The name Freewar is derived from the domain freewar.de, which Sotrax had originally registered in 2003 as an attempt to intercept requests from people on the Internet for Freeware-programs. However, he made a typo when registering the domain. Later, he noticed that the name fit well with an unnamed game he recently programmed. Sotrax ran the Alpha version of the game under the domain freewar.de. This name became permanent, and Sotrax kept Freewar as the name for the game. This name has been a trademark at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office since 2006.  Freewar meeting  To promote social contact between the Freewar community outside the virtual world as well as to organize dedicated players, Freewar meetings have taken place for several years. Meetings are usually held in Germany twice a year. Locations vary and popularity is increasing. Several dozen regular players from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland travel to these meetings.
