He was the mayor of Philadelphia from 1824 to 1828. Watson was known for his efforts to free free blacks who had been kidnapped in Philadelphia and transported to southern plantations as slaves and in pursuing members of Patty Cannon's gang of kidnappers. Biography Watson was born in 1784 in Bucks County to Isaac Watson, a carpenter, and Ann Jenks. Watson later became a lumber merchant in Philadelphia. In 1822, Watson was elected as an alderman on the Common Council. In 1824, Robert Wharton completed what would be the last of his 14 terms in office and Watson was elected by the council in a 25-0 vote. As mayor, Watson had the duty of organizing Philadelphia's reception for the Marquis de Lafayette on his tour of the United States. He was re-elected in 1825 and 1826. Watson was contacted by two men, John Hamilton and John Henderson. Both were southern plantation owners who had been approached by Jesse Cannon and Joe Johnson of the Cannon-Johnson Gang to buy Sam Scomp and Enos Tilghman. Scomp told of how he had been kidnapped from Philadelphia and transported to Mississippi. Another man, Cornelius Sinclair, had already been sold in Alabama. Watson worked to obtain affidavits from family and employers and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society joined to find documentation that the teenagers were indeed free. Sinclair was freed after Watson found a white resident who could travel to Alabama to testify on Sinclair's behalf.In the case of Scomp and Tilghman, Watson reached out to Richard Stockton, who was the Attorney General of Mississippi. Stockton was opposed to kidnapping free blacks, and informed Watson it was a matter of going to the Circuit Court with evidence. Johnson and Tilghman were later freed and placed on a ship to Philadelphia where they testified to Watson to let him determine that they were born free. Watson then pursued the kidnappers. He issued a proclamation offering a reward of 500 dollars for the apprehension and prosecution of anyone involved in kidnapping free blacks in the city. Watson assigned his constable Samuel Garrigues, who had helped free the kidnapped slaves, to set out to arrest members of the Cannon Gang. One member of the gang was arrested in 1826. Garrigues traced one member of the gang, John Purnell, Boston where he was arrested and changed with kidnapping. The two were initially acquitted, but Purnell was found guilty in Quarter sessions court with Sinclair, Scomp and Tilghman testifying against him.. Philadelphia did not have a regular police force, but the city appropriated $500 annually for police work in the city. By 1828, Watson had spent $2,500 on kidnapping cases. Although he was unsuccessful in bringing Patty Cannon to justice, he was able to get 10 kidnap victims released. He failed on two others because they could not find a white person who could testify that those individuals were born free. Although blacks could give testimony in Philadelphia courts, they were barred in courts of the slave states. In the mayoral election of 1828, George M. Dallas was selected by the Select and Common Councils by a vote of 24 to 6. After his defeat, he continued to serve on the Common Council. In 1833, he was appointed to a commission to develop a police force in the city. In 1833, the city of Philadelphia unveiled a new police structure with four police districts each with a capitain, lieutenants and patrol officers. In 1835, he was again nominated as a candidate for mayor, but was defeated in the election by John Swift who took 19 votes of the council to 11 for Watson. Watson was reported to have died on April 9, 1841.

MartinoMartino p. 142.) between the Roman Empire and Cantabrian indigenous tribes. It would be located in the territory of present-day Cantabria, with two possible locations: Aradillos, near Reinosa and the Roman city of Juli√≥briga; the second possible location would be the castro of the Galician Thorn, in the Mountains of the Shield. According to Roman historiography it belonged to the blendii. Aracillum in the classical texts  In Floro's account of the war, and according to Eutimio Martino's translation, it is said that \\"third, the fortress of Aracillum resists with great thrust; nevertheless, it was taken\\" (tertio Aracelium oppidum magna vi repugnat; captum tamen.)Martino p. 32. For his part, Orosio writes that \\"later, the fortress of Racilium, although it resisted with great force and for a long time, was finally taken and razed\\" (racilium deinde oppidum magna vi ac diu repugnans, postmodern captum ac dirutum est.)Martino p. 33.  Location  There are two theories for the location of this fort. Curiously, Aracillum was almost the only battle in which the main researchers agreed on its location (traditional hypothesis), but the discovery of new archaeological remains in Cantabria has made a new hypothesis appear. * Traditional hypothesis: the Aracillum fort would be located in the south of Cantabria, in the Aradillos area (Campoo de Enmedio.) Already in 1768, in his work La Cantabria, Father Enrique Fl√≥rez pointed out \\"the place that today they call Aradillos, little disfigured from Aracillo\\".Fl√≥rez p. 47. Also Aureliano Fern√°ndez-Guerra in his study Cantabria identifies \\"the battle of Aracillo or Atracillo, Aradillos, above Reinosa.\\"Aureliano p. 29. Adolf Schulten agrees, who bets on Aradillos, specifically on the 1200-meter mountain that has been close to the current town.Schulten. More recently, E. Martino points out the set of Roman roads and moats (especially the Ria√±o de Argacillo moats, which he identifies as another toponym derived from Aracillum, and La Muela) to point out that ‚Äúthe plateau served as a Roman position against the top of El Raposo, which has ruined walls,\\" once the Aracillum fort was surpassed by the Romans.Martino pp. 94-98. * New hypothesis: the discovery of a pre-Roman Cantabrian fort and high altitude Roman camps in the Galician Thorn (Mountains of the Shield, Cantabria) by Eduardo Peralta Labrador (doctor in Protohistory and Archeology by the University of Paris,\\" Federico Fern√°ndez and Roberto Ayll√≥n has led to the appearance of this new hypothesis that would identify said fort with Aracillum. The fort is located at about 1000 meters of altitude and is made up, according to Peralta, \\"of a great fortress‚Ä¶remains of an acropolis protected by lines of walls, and imposing walls of that fortress.\\" In the vicinity of the fortress there would be four more pre-Roman forts, as well as at least three Roman camps. In addition they have been a Roman denarius of 42 AD, a catapult projectile, a legionnaire's pilum and other pieces. Peralta rejects the identification of Aracillum with Aradillos because Aradillos is a \\"militarily indefensible\\" site and proposes the Galician Thorn instead because it coincides \\"with the references and sources of the classic Floro and Orosio.\\" Furthermore, he argues that this area \\"was the best natural entrance to the coast...it is located in front of the bay of the Cantabrian capital, Portus Victoriae, where the reinforcements brought by the fleet from Aquitaine had to take place.\\" Indeed, he contends that the sites of the Galician Thorn show the first archaeological evidence \\"of the Cantabrian wars throughout the northern Cantabrian Mountains.\\"  Footnotes  Category:Roman towns and cities in Spain Category:History of Cantabria  Works Cited   * ","title":"Aracillum"},{"id":"64208409","text":"The Immortal Regiment () is a massive civil event staged in major cities in Russia and around the world every 9 May during the Victory Day celebrations. It is also a public non-profit organization, created in Russia on a voluntary basis with the aim of \\"immortalizing\\" the memory of home front workers, armed forces service personnel, partisans, personnel of resistance organizations, and personnel of law enforcement and emergency services. It involves people carrying on the memory of war veterans, with participants carrying pictures of relatives and/or family friends who served in the country's labor sector, paramilitary units, the Soviet Armed Forces and law enforcement organizations during the Second World War. History=Origins Even before the name appeared, similar actions were organized in some cities of the USSR.

In 1981, on the Square of the Fighters of the Revolution in Art. A procession of mothers in black robes with portraits of their dead sons (the idea belonged to the director Yulia Sinelnikova) took place in the Rostov Oblast. In the post- Soviet years, similar events took place both in Russia and in a number of other countries. In Jerusalem in 1999, citizens took to the streets portraits of soldiers on Victory Day. In 2007, the Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Tyumen Region Gennady Ivanov, conceived a parade of citizens holding pictures in a procession,–°–µ–º–µ–π–Ω—ã–π –∞–ª—å–±–æ–º // –¢—é–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è, 08.05.2007 –≥.¬´–ö–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ–ª –ü–æ–±–µ–¥—ã¬ª ‚Äî —É ¬´–¢—é–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏–π¬ª // –¢—é–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è, 15.10.2015 –≥.–ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä –∏–¥–µ–∏ ¬´–ë–µ—Å—Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–ª–∫–∞¬ª: –º–Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Å–Ω–∏–ª–∞—Å—å —ç—Ç–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ —à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è // –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è 24, 9.05.2019 with him gaining the idea of organizing a \\"Parade of Victors\\", in which people with portraits of their front-line relatives walked along the main Tyumen street.–ì—Ä–∏—à–∏–Ω–∞, –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è. –†—ã–∫–æ–≤—Ü–µ–≤–∞, –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞. The initiative, at the call of Gennady Ivanov, was taken up by other regions of Russia, and two years later the \\"Parade of Winners\\" took place in Kazan, Kemerovo, and about 20 regions. In 2010, on the initiative of the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Lyudmila Shvetsova, a procession with photographs of veterans first took place in the capital. Transition from an idea to a global eventFirst event with this name= In 2011, journalists Sergey Lapenkov, Sergey Kolotovkin and Igor Dmitriev noticed that fewer and fewer veterans took part in street processions on Victory Day. In the spirit of the holiday, they built on this idea and created an official organization. 9 May 2012 became the birth date of the movement in its modern form. A column of city residents passed through the streets of Tomsk, who carried placards with photographs of their relatives who fought in the Great Patriotic War. The rally, called the Immortal Regiment, was attended by more than six thousand people who carried more than two thousand portraits of war participants. =Expansion of the geography of the event (2012-2014)= Since it was conceived in 2007, the initiative has been met with unprecedented support. Coverage in regional and federal Media has led to the popularity of the idea proposed by the creators of the action, has increased dramatically. After May 2012, a community of coordinators from different cities and countries began to take shape around Tomsk. In December 2012, representatives of more than 15 cities of Russia expressed a desire to organize an action. By February 2013, the number of cities had grown to 30 and was also expanded to four countries (Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Israel). =Global promotion (since 2015)= Since it was introduced in 2012, it has been conducted in cities such as Moscow, Washington D.C., Dushanbe, Berlin, and Yekaterinburg. By 2015 it had received national status. The Immortal Regiment therefore has become one of the most important elements of the celebrations of Victory Day in Russia. In 2015, the \\"Immortal Regiment\\" was held in 1150 settlements of 17 countries, and 42 countries in 2016. In 2015, Moscow organizers proposed a march of the Immortal Regiment on the Red Square. To obtain the necessary permission, a corresponding request was sent to the President of the Russian Federation on behalf of three public organizations: the Immortal Regiment - Moscow, the All- Russian Popular Front and the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation. On 9 May 2015, the event took place for the first time on the Red Square, immediately after the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade in honor of the 70th anniversary.–ê–∫—Ü–∏—é ¬´–ë–µ—Å—Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–ª–∫¬ª –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ —Ö–æ—Ç—è—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ // –ò–ê REGNUM. 30 –ú–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2015.

It has also come under criticism by those who charge that many of its participants have carried random photographs and discarded them after the event. The Immortal Regiment campaign gained such popularity that its name became a kind of brand. Gradually, certain points began to indicate an attempt to use it for political PR. At the end of summer and autumn of 2018, various left-wing forces organized the \\"Shameful Regiment\\" marches, on which photographs of prominent political figures who supported raising the retirement age. It took place as part of the 2018 Russian pension protests. Description The main procession in Moscow usually follows the Moscow Victory Day Parade in the morning, and is a televised event aired all over the world. The front line of the procession carries a banner with the words Bessmertniy Polk written on it. Up to 12 million Russians have participated in the march nationwide in recent years. There are also a number of local marches following the same procedure in many Russian cities, including regional and republican capitals and major economic hubs. In Russia The 2016 procession in Maykop, the capital city of the Republic of Adygea. In 2015, the term \\"Immortal Regiment\\" was chosen in an analogy to the term \\"Immortal Barrack\\" as a neololgism for the Russian Word of the Year.\\"–°–õ–û–í–û –ì–û–î–ê-2015. –ò–¢–û–ì–ò –í–´–ë–û–†–û–í\\", Mikhail Epstein, December 12, 2015 Since 2015, the President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials have participated in the procession in Moscow. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia and the postponement of the 2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade, the Immortal Regiment march, which was supposed to be held on 9 May, was also postponed and was announced to be held Navy Day in a video- conference with President Putin and Minister Sergey Shoygu. The reason that was given by President Putin was that \\"it is impossible to observe any distance by definition\\" in light of the pandemic. These plans were later scrapped and the march was postponed until 2021.

Legendary overview According to legend, this king arrived at the place with a group of ex-combatant soldiers from the Trojan War and found it fertile and with enough water, exceptional qualities for its settlement. In that case these settlers would be the precedents to the Iron Age city Ikesankom Konbouto that would later give rise to the Roman Complutum. Both Ptolemy and Pliny give this name to the hill of the Viso, perhaps to mythologize its inhabitants for having maintained a fierce resistance at the arrival of the first Romans to the area of the Henares Corridor, since this resistance will occur in almost all tribes that frequent the natural pass between the Tagus, Duero and Ebro rivers, culminating in the famous Numantino siege within the campaign commanded by Marco Porcio Cat√≥n in what will come to be the conquest of Carpetan√≠a, begun in 195 BC and ended with the conquest of the Numancia fort in 133 BC.

Her research focuses include behavioral and evolutionary ecology, speciation, sexual selection, and evolutionary aspects of cancer. Working mainly with fish model organisms, St. Mary is also interested in marine fisheries management and reproduction and evolution in hatchery settings. St. Mary received her Bachelor's degree in Biology from Harvard Radcliffe College before earning her Ph.D from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1994. Her thesis was on the determinant of sex allocation patterns and maintenance of simultaneous hermaphroditism in the blue banded goby and zebra goby.  Research Focuses = The evolution of parental care  St. Mary's research into the evolution of parental care has caused a shift in the conceptual understanding of the evolution of prenatal care (in fishes). The previous theory proposed by evolutionary biologists is parental care comes at a tradeoff - by engaging in parental care for current offspring, males are decreasing the time and energy available for future mating events or survivorship. Thus it would be expected that not males who do not provide parental care would have increased lifetime reproductive success by fertilizing eggs from more females. This would suggest that males should invest in courtship rather than parental care; however this is not what is observed. Together with colleagues, St. Mary showed in species with male-only parental care, females evaluate males based on their level of parental care, and that males show increased care in the presence of potential mates. More recently, studies of bi-parental care species like certain cichlid fish validated these data and showed that some parental care behaviors function to increase both survival of offspring and mating success.  Evolution, behavior, and conservation  St. Mary has also collaborated on the study of the effect of agriculture (and agricultural contaminants) on gonadal form and function in the giant cane toad Bufo marinus (also known as Rhinella marina), which found that toads living on land used for agriculture had increased incidences of gonadal abnormalities and intersex gonads. Males were feminized or demasculinized with altered testosterone levels corresponding to the level of agricultural land use. She also helped publish another study of the giant toad species which demonstrated reduced spermatogenesis in toads living in agricultural areas due to endocrine disrupting chemicals. Other studies authored in this field include the ecological determinants of settlement choice in coral reef fish larvae, and the effects of hatchery rearing of Florida largemouth bass.  Autotomy  St. Mary has also contributed significantly to the field of autotomy. Though a behavior that has evolved repeatedly - seen in crabs, lizards, crickets, and more, the evolutionary pressure behind limb loss is not well understood. The loss of a limb exposes an organism to significant costs - loss of blood or body fluid, risk of infection, and the loss of that limb function, which could affect reproductive success. However, she and her colleagues have demonstrated that in some cases self-autotomy can reduce the cost of injury or allow the organism to escape predation, confirming two popular theories behind the practice. While autotomy for escaping predators is relatively widely accepted, limb loss as a method to reduce the survival cost injury is a novel feature first demonstrated by Dr. St. Mary et. al. By autotomizing at a preformed breakage plane the organism can reduce the survival cost of the injury.

Early life and education Delmont earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard University before enrolling in Brown University for his Master's degree and Ph.D. in American Studies. Career Upon earning his PhD, Delmont accepted a position as an Assistant professor of American studies at Scripps College. During his short tenure at Scripps, he was the recipient of the 2011 Professor of the Year Award and published his book The Nicest Kids in Town: American Bandstand, Rock n‚Äô Roll, and the Struggle for Civil Rights in 1950s Philadelphia through the University of California Press. In his book, he discredits claims by the late Dick Clark, host and producer of American Bandstand, that the show was a pioneer of on-air racial politics and integration. As part of his research into the discontent of the show around racial politics, he interviewed 21 Philadelphia natives who had attended, watched, or protested the TV show. He published historical accounts of American Bandstand incorporating and encouraging systematic marginalization of local African American fans and musicians throughout its running. By June 2014, Delmont left Scripps College and accepted a position at Arizona State University (ASU) as a professor in their history department. During his tenure at ASU, Delmont published his second book titled Making roots: A nation captivated through the University of California Press. The book explored the history and creation of the 1977 miniseries Roots. In the same year, he also published Why Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation, a historical review of America's desegregated school bussing and overall educational equality policy.

Obviously, a single system or instrument does not presently exist that could fulfil this function, however its concept may be approached by some current or future combination of existing observational systems.www.research.ibm.com: Macroscopes will help us understand Earth's complexity in infinite detail. Accessed 8 June 2020 The term \\"macroscope\\" has also been applied to a method or compendium which can view some more specific aspect of global scientific phenomena in its entirety, such as all plant life, or all life on earth.Encyclopedia of Life, February 2008: \\"Scientists to explore life's mysteries through encyclopedic 'macroscope'.\\" AAAS EurekaAlert, accessed 06 June 2020. The term has also been used in the humanities, as a generic label for tools which permit an overview of various other forms of \\"big data\\". History of the concept The term \\"macroscope\\" was introduced by the ecologist Howard T. Odum in 1971Howard T. Odum, 1971. Environment, Power, and Society. Wiley, New York, 331 pp., who used it (in contrast to the microscope, which shows small objects in great detail) to represent a kind of \\"detail eliminator\\" which thus permits a better overview of ecological systems for improved management (Odum, 1971, figure 10). Some authors, such as Hidefumi Imura, continue to use the term as more-or-less synonymous with an overview or large scale pattern analysis of data in their field.Imura, H., 2013. Environmental Systems Studies: A Macroscope for Understanding and Operating Spaceship Earth. Springer, 151 pp. (original in Japanese, published 2009)de Magny, G.C., Renaud, F., Durand, P. & Gu√©gan, J.-F., 2008. Health ecology: a new tool, the macroscope. Chapter 8 (pp. 129-148) in Thomas, F., Gu√©gan, J.-F. & Renaud, F. (editors): Ecology and Evolution of Parasitism: Hosts to Ecosystems. Oxford University Press, 240 pp. Odum's concept was then expanded upon by the French scientific thinker Jo√´l de Rosnay, who wrote a book explaining his usage of the concept in 1975; in de Rosnay's view, the macroscope could be turned not only on the natural world but also on human- related systems such as the growth of cities, economics, and the behaviour of humans in society. More recent workers have tended to use the term synonymously with a whole-of-Earth observational system, or portion thereof, underpinned particularly by satellite imagery derived from remote sensing, and/or by in situ observations obtained via sensor networks (see below). As an extension of its science context, the term \\"macroscope\\" has also been applied in the humanities, as a generic term for any tool permitting an overview of, and insight into \\"big data\\" collections in that or related areas.Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan and Scott Weingart, 2015. Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian's Macroscope. World Scientific Publishing Company, 308 pp. For completeness, it should be mentioned that the concept of a \\"reverse microscope\\" is not entirely new: around 80 years earlier, the author Lewis Caroll in the second volume of his novel Sylvie and Bruno, published in 1893, described a fictional professor who includes in his lecture an instrument that will shrink an elephant to the size of a mouse, that he termed the \\"megaloscope\\".Lewis Carroll, 1893: Sylvie and Bruno Concluded.

Interpretation and practical implementations Image from a 2007 \\"macroscope\\" demonstration concept from the ICT Division of CSIRO, showing physical data from a Fleck wireless sensor network overlaid on Google topographic imagery The more practical aspect of exactly what constitutes a macroscope has varied through time and according to the interests, requirements, and field of activity of the workers concerned. Odum's initial concept was for the study of ecosystems, by integrating the results of existing methods of surveying, identifying, and classifying their contents, then eliminating fine scale detail to obtain a \\"big picture\\" view suitable for analysis and, as needed, simulation. De Rosnay viewed his \\"macroscope\\" as a systems-based viewpoint for the study of (among other things) the nature of human society, and understanding of the rationale for human actions. He wrote: For some recent workers engaged in scientific surveys of aspects of Earth systems (such as Dornelas et al.), the macroscope is the envisaged set of the observational tools that collectively will deliver the desired synoptic suite of observations over the relevant field of study (in their case for the marine realm, itemised as satellites, drones, camera traps, passive acoustic samplers, biologgers, environmental DNA and human observations), while for others, the macroscope is already here, as a sort of \\"virtual instrument\\", with data sources such as Landsat satellite imagery providing the requisite high resolution Earth view,Endsley, K.A., 2018: \\"Remote sensing of socio-ecological dynamics in urban neighborhoods\\".

Writing in 2017 they stated: For Craig Mundey of Microsoft, the benefits of the macroscope are not only for observation of the Earth, but also of aspects of the people on it: (Interestingly, in 2020, 11 years after Mundey's above comment was made, researchers were using exactly such techniques in order to gain more insight into the origins of the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic.Morgan McFall-Johnsen, 2020: \\"Satellite images and internet trends suggest the coronavirus may have emerged months before China reported it: 'Something was happening in October'\\". www.businessinsider.com.au, accessed 11 June 2020.)

His case deeply affected public opinion on racism in Italy and led to a reform of Italian legislation regarding the recognition of refugee status. The killing of Masslo resulted in the acknowledgement of the need to guarantee adequate rights and duties to immigrants, whose number had grown considerably in the 1980s, reaching 600,000 by 1990 according to some sources; 1.3 million according to others. Shortly after his death, the largest anti-racist demonstration in the country was organized in Rome, attended by 200,000 people. The story of the non-recognition of refugee status to citizens of countries outside Eastern Europe led the government to rapidly issue a decree-law before the end of the year, later converted into the Martelli Law. The law would function as an amnesty law, and recognize the status of non-European foreigners under the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and eliminated the 'geographical limitation' for political asylum seekers (as was already established by the Geneva Convention of 1951). Masslo's death is seen as the beginning of a new chapter in multi-ethnic coexistence in Italy.  Early life and immigration  Jerry Masslo was born in 1959 in Umtata (present-day Mthatha in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa), which was between 1976 and 1994 the capital of Transkei, a former bantustan (nominally independent land, set aside for black people during the apartheid regime). He lived there in impoverished conditions in a hut made of wood and metal sheets, but yet managed to continue his studies in schools that were 'for blacks only'. Masslo's father died during a black rights demonstration together with Masslo's 7-year old daughter, who was killed by a stray bullet. Masslo was a politically active student, and was sympathetic to the mass civil rights movement for black people (such as African National Congress, United Democratic Front and Black Consciousness Movement) that opposed apartheid. After the Transkei coup d'√©tat of 1987, Masslo got his wife and two children to escape via Zimbabwe and eventually reached Lusaka (Zambia) where some of his family lived in exile. Helped by a friend, he travelled clandestinely, together with his younger brother, on a Nigerian cargo ship, hidden in a lifeboat and eating its emergency rations. When his brother developed a fever, Masslo left the ship in Port Harcourt (Nigeria) to buy medicine, but was unable to rejoin the ship before it continued its journey. He would never see his brother again. After selling his remaining possessions (including a gold watch from his father) he managed to buy a plane ticket to Rome, where he landed on 21 March 1988. Upon arrival in Italy, he immediately applied for political asylum with the security authorities. Under the principle of 'geographic limitation', they were instructed to refuse his request, because under their instructions political asylum could only be requested by citizens of Eastern European countries that were escaping communist regimes. Faced with the refusal, Masslo asked to be put in telephone contact with the Italian headquarters of Amnesty International, who put him in contact with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Interior Ministry decided that he could not be granted asylum because not only was there the geographic restriction, there was also the matter that most of his fellow countrymen faced the same problems, and there was no personal persecution. UNHCR negotiated with the Interior Ministry, and after some weeks in an airport cell, he eventually obtained entry permission with refugee status recognised by the United Nations but not by Italy: however, Italy would not force him to return to South Africa. At 3 May 1988, Masslo was welcomed by the Community of Sant'Egidio at the request of Amnesty in their 'Tent of Abraham' at the via Veneziani in the center of Rome. The organization housed many refugees from various countries, mostly from Africa. He applied there to be expatriated to Canada, indicating his desire to be reunited with his wife and children. The Canadian representation in Rome was willing to hear his case, but there were many bureaucratic hurdles to overcome. He started to learn Italian and took on occasional jobs, sending any leftover money to his family. In the summer of 1988, he decided to travel to Villa Literno, close to Naples, where he heard would be opportunities to work in the tomato harvest.  Working at Villa Literno  With Masslo, thousands of immigrants travelled to Villa Literno to look for work, year after year, under harsh conditions. The area at that time mainly earned its income from agriculture, and a predominant role was played by the Casalesi clan of the Camorra. The tomato fields were subsidized by both the Italian government and the European Communities and required during the harvest the massive use of labour force at low prices, for which farmers were unable to find Italian labourers. Migrants moved around seasonally as work was requested. During the harvest, the town's population would increase from its usual 10,000 inhabitants to include 4,000 immigrants. Each morning, Masslo would join hundreds of immigrants at the crossroads of the village, nicknamed by locals as \\"piazza degli schiavi\\" (slaves' square) where the \\"caporalato\\" (illegal intermediary recruiter) would collect them to go to the fields for the harvest. The job could last up to fourteen hours per day and was paid per box. In order to collect a daily wage of 40,000 lire (at the time equivalent to about $30‚Äì40), the workers had to harvest forty crates of 25kg each. At night Masslo would stay like most immigrants in the ruins of farmhouses, sleeping on cardboard without light or a toilet. At the end of harvest season, after two months, Masslo moved back to the Tent of Abraham in Rome. His visa for Canada did not arrive, and in the summer of 1989 he returned to Villa Literno for another harvest season. This time, there was a growing awareness in the barracks where immigrants slept that they were being exploited ‚Äì especially as the pay per crate went down from 1,000 to 800 lire because of an over-supply of labour. Masslo attended meetings where immigrants had appealed to the union but encountered resistance. At the same time, acceptance by the locals was decreasing ‚Äì and resistance was growing, both lawful and unlawful. Not only were signatures being collected to send the foreigners away, but episodes of intolerance were also multiplying, and immigrants could no longer walk freely in the city in fear to be attacked by local adolescent males who had organised themselves into squadrons (that were characterised as similar to those of the Ku Klux Klan) and terrorised the immigrants to stay away from the city centre. Some businesses declared themselves 'off limits' to foreigners. The carabinieri (police) found leaflets addressed to the inhabitants of the village, inciting violence against immigrants. The situation was getting the attention of the media, and a Tg2 camera crew interviewed immigrants, including Masslo, about their conditions.  Murder  When the harvest was nearly over, on the evening of 24 August 1989, Masslo returned to a shed at Via Gallinelle (in the town), where he slept with 28 other migrants. A group of thugs raided them, keeping their faces covered, with weapons and bars and demanding money. Because the immigrants were not able to deposit their earnings, they still had most of their 2 months' earnings on them. Some of the migrants immediately handed over the money (an estimated 1.5 million lire), while others refused. Consequently, the thieves struck the 29-year-old Sudanese Ayuel Bol Yansen with the back of a gun. The situation deteriorated and one of the robbers shot his 7.65 caliber pistol three times at Masslo and another worker. The thugs fled in fear of a mass response by the immigrants. The Kenyan Kirago Antony Yrugo survived but Masslo died. The Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) asked for a state funeral for Masslo, which was held on 28 August in the presence of Minister of Foreign Affairs Gianni De Michelis and other representatives and media. Tg2 broadcast the funeral live, as well as a quote from Masslo's earlier interview: After the service, Masslo was buried in an anonymous tomb in the municipal cemetery of Villa Literno. Three young men were convicted a year later and sentenced to prison sentences of 24.5, 24.5 and 22 years. A fourth killer was a minor at the time of the murder and was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment. The three admitted to participating in the robbery, but none confessed to shooting him. They claimed that the murder was not racially motivated but rather intended as a robbery of easy targets.  Reactions and subsequent developments  The death of Masslo reached a wide audience within Italy, with headlines on the front pages of several major newspapers. The national broadcaster TG3 opened the news with \\"Death squad at Villa Literno shoots black workers.\\" Prominent figures spoke out against the act, including Pope John Paul II, who condemned the murder and called Masslo a \\"victim of intolerance\\" and the president of the republic, Francesco Cossiga. It was not the first racist incident in the country to make the news: an Ethiopian woman had been forced to give up a seat on the bus, and a black man was thrown out of a window by another gang in Naples. On 20 September the same year, a first strike by immigrants was held against the caporalato in service of the Camorra. Masslo's death galvanized a much greater public discussion of immigration and opposition to racism. On 7 October, Italy's largest-yet national demonstration against racism took place in Rome, with 200,000 participants from Italy and abroad. In February 1990 the Martelli Law was implemented, a first attempt to tackle immigration issues in Italy. In the subsequent summer, a tent city in Villa Literno called \\"Village of Solidarity\\" was built and named after Jerry Masslo to welcome the immigrant workers and provide them support. In the following years, despite the media attention, the condition of immigrants in the countryside around Villa Literno did not get adequate support. The difficult sanitary conditions of the settlement in which the laborers lived made it receive the name Ghetto di Villa Literno.

A victory at the World Traditional Kickboxing Association in 2015 made her a competitive kick-boxing champion, and the following year she was a French national champion in semi-contact karate. Beginning in 2012 she was an active member of the French Socialist Party, and she ran on socialist party lists in elections in 2014 and 2015 but did not obtain a seat. During the 2017 French presidential election, she was the main spokesperson for Jean- Luc M√©lenchon as he led the new party La France Insoumise. In late 2018, she left La France Insoumise for the left unity party G√©n√©ration.s, and in 2019 she affiliated herself with the movement P√¥le radical et √©cologiste (fr). Early life and education Soilihi grew up in the 4th district of Marseille, in a family with a Comoro-Moroccan background. As of 2019, Soilihi was a doctoral student in law at the Aix-Marseille University, where she has also been an instructor in criminal law. Athletic career Soilihi has held national or global titles in two sports. In November 2015, Soilihi became a kickboxing champion as a result of a victory at the World Traditional Kickboxing Association. In 2016, she became a French champion of semi-contact karate. Political work After witnessing a speech by Marie-No√´lle Lienemann, Soilihi joined the Socialist Party of France in 2012. During the 2014 municipal elections in Marseille, she was a candidate on the list of Patrick Mennucci. However, she was not elected in the ensuing contest with Jean-Claude Gaudin. Soilihi also contested the departmental elections of 2015 in the 6th arrondissement of Marseille. Soilihi ran in a pair with a running mate, and they were eliminated in the first round. During the regional elections of 2015 in Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur, she was on the list led by the socialist Christophe Castaner, for whom she was also a spokesperson. This list came in third position at the end of the first round with 16.6% of the votes cast, but strategically withdrew in the second round to consolidate the opposition to the National Front, sacrificing any chances of obtaining seats in the election. After being introduced to Jean-Luc M√©lenchon by Sophia Chikirou (fr), Soilihi joined La France Insoumise in 2016 and became the national spokesperson for M√©lenchon during his 2017 presidential campaign. She also co-wrote the movement's white paper Pour un sport √©mancipateur et lib√©r√© de l'argent. During the 2017 legislative elections she was also listed as the deputy to the socialist candidate Anne Di Marino in the third district of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, which was allegedly a mistake. This pairing lost in the first round with 18.5% of votes in the third position. Soilihi withdrew from consideration as a candidate for La France Insoumise in the 2019 European Elections. On November 8, 2018, she announced that she would quit La France Insoumise due to strategic disagreements and concerns about infighting. She then joined the G√©n√©ration.s movement created by Beno√Æt Hamon and was placed second on the party list for Europeans.

It was written by Peter Rousseeuw and Annick M. Leroy, and published in 1987 by Wiley. Background The Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram of stars plotted by luminosity and color. Robust regression methods can fit a curve to the main sequence, the central curve in this diagram, without being strongly influenced by the groups of stars far from the main sequence. Linear regression is the problem of inferring a linear functional relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, from data sets where that relation has been obscured by noise. Ordinary least squares assumes that the data all lie near the fit line or plane, but depart from it by the addition of normally distributed residual values. In contrast, robust regression methods work even when some of the data points are outliers that bear no relation to the fit line or plane, possibly because the data draws from a mixture of sources or possibly because an adversarial agent is trying to corrupt the data to cause the regression method to produce an inaccurate result. A typical application, discussed in the book, involves the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram of star types, in which one wishes to fit a curve through the main sequence of stars without the fit being thrown off by the outlying giant stars and white dwarfs. The breakdown point of a robust regression method is the fraction of outlying data that it can tolerate while remaining accurate. For this style of analysis, higher breakdown points are better. The breakdown point for ordinary least squares is near zero (a single outlier can make the fit become arbitrarily far from the remaining uncorrupted data) while some other methods have breakdown points as high as 50%. Although these methods require few assumptions about the data, and work well for data whose noise is not well understood, they may have somewhat lower efficiency than ordinary least squares (requiring more data for a given accuracy of fit) and their implementation may be complex and slow. Topics The book has seven chapters. The first is introductory; it describes simple linear regression (in which there is only one independent variable), discusses the possibility of outliers that corrupt either the dependent or the independent variable, provides examples in which outliers produce misleading results, defines the breakdown point, and briefly introduces several methods for robust simple regression, including repeated median regression. The second and third chapters analyze in more detail the least median of squares method for regression (in which one seeks a fit that minimizes the median of the squared residuals) and the least trimmed squares method (in which one seeks to minimize the sum of the squared residuals that are below the median). These two methods both have breakdown point 50% and can be applied for both simple regression (chapter two) and multivariate regression (chapter three). Although the least median has an appealing geometric description (as finding a strip of minimum height containing half the data), its low efficiency leads to the recommendation that the least trimmed squares be used instead; least trimmed squares can also be interpreted as using the least median method to find and eliminate outliers and then using simple regression for the remaining data, and approaches simple regression in its efficiency. As well as describing these methods and analyzing their statistical properties, these chapters also describe how to use the authors' software for implementing these methods. The third chapter also includes descriptions of some alternative estimators with high breakdown points. The fourth chapter describes one-dimensional estimation of a location parameter or central tendency and its software implementation, and the fifth chapter goes into more detail about the algorithms used by the software to compute these estimates efficiently. The sixth chapter concerns outlier detection, comparing methods for identifying data points as outliers based on robust statistics with other widely-used methods, and the final chapter concerns higher-dimensional location problems as well as time series analysis and problems of fitting an ellipsoid or covariance matrix to data. As well as using the breakdown point to compare statistical methods, the book also looks at their equivariance: for which families of data transformations does the fit for transformed data equal the transformed version of the fit for the original data? In keeping with the book's focus on applications, it features many examples of analyses done using robust methods, comparing the resulting estimates with the estimates obtained by standard non-robust methods. Theoretical material is included, but set aside so that it can be easily skipped over by less theoretically-inclined readers. The authors take the position that robust methods can be used both to check the applicability of ordinary regression (when the results of both methods agree) and to supplant them in cases where the results disagree. Audience and reception The book is aimed at applied statisticians, with the goal of convincing them to use the robust methods that it describes. Unlike previous work in robust statistics, it makes robust methods both understandable by and (through its associated software) available to practitioners. No prior knowledge of robust statistics is required, although some background in basic statistical techniques is assumed. The book could also be used as a textbook, although reviewer P. J. Laycock calls the possibility of such a use \\"bold and progressive\\" and reviewers Seheult and Green point out that such a course would be unlikely to fit into British statistical curricula. Reviewers Seheult and Green complain that too much of the book acts as a user guide to the authors' software, and should have been trimmed. However, reviewer Gregory F. Piepel writes that \\"the presentation is very good\\", and he recommends the book to any user of statistical methods. And, while suggesting the reordering of some material, Karen Kafadar strongly recommends the book as a textbook for graduate students and a reference for professionals. And reviewer A. C. Atkinson concisely summarizes the book as \\"interesting and important\\". Related books There have been multiple previous books on robust regression and outlier detection, including: *Identification of Outliers by D. M. Hawkins (1980) *Robust Statistics by Peter J. Huber (1981) *Introduction to Robust and Quasi-Robust Statistical Methods by W. J. J. Rey (1983) *Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis by David C. Hoaglin, Frederick Mosteller, and John Tukey (1983) *Robust Statistics by Hampel, Ronchetti, Rousseeuw, and Stahel (1986) In comparison, Robust Regression and Outlier Detection combines both robustness and the detection of outliers. It is less theoretical, more focused on data and software, and more focused on the breakdown point than on other measures of robustness. Additionally, it is the first to highlight the importance of \\"leverage\\", the phenomenon that samples with outlying values of the independent variable can have a stronger influence on the fit than samples where the independent variable has a central value.

In the course of his more than forty-year career as a musician, Suske has been first concertmaster of the Staatskapelle Berlin, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra as well as the Bayreuth Festival orchestra. He was also a member of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Quartet and founder of a quartet named after him in Berlin. Until 1990 Suske held professorships at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Franz Liszt, Weimar and the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig.  Life  Born in Reichenberg, Tschechoslowakei, Suske received violin lessons in early childhood from his father, Franz Suske, who played second violins in the municipal orchestra of Reichenberg. After the end of the Second World War and expulsion from the Sudetenland the family settled in Greiz (Thuringia), where Suske resumed his violin lessons. In 1947 he became a pupil of the Weimar university teacher and violinist Gerhard Bosse, who grew up in Greiz. After the latter's move in 1951 he followed him to Leipzig, where Bosse worked as a violin professor and first concertmaster of the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra. After his graduation in 1954, Suske became first principal viola player and later concertmaster at the Leipzig Gewandhaus. In 1962 he became first concertmaster at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, from where he returned to Leipzig in 1977 as first concertmaster of the Gewandhaus Orchestra at Kurt Masur's request. At the same time, Suske was concertmaster of the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra nine times from 1991 to 2000, and he was also repeatedly appointed by the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Tokyo as guest concertmaster.  Chamber music activities  In 1951, his teacher Gerhard Bosse accepted Suske as second violinist in his newly founded string Quartet. In 1955 he also became second violinist in the traditional Leipzig Gewandhaus-Quartett. After moving to Berlin, he founded the \\"Suske Quartet\\" there in 1965, which was initially named after him (later Berlin String Quartet), which played an important role in the chamber music life of the GDR and with whom he made guest appearances in Europe, the USA and Japan. In 1970, the quartet - consisting of Klaus Peters (Vl), Karl-Heinz Dommus (Va) and Matthias Pfaender (Cl) - was awarded the National Prize of the GDR \\"for its contribution to the masterful interpretation of works of the national cultural heritage and the socialist musical creation of the GDR\\", III class for art and literature. The completion of an entire recording of Beethoven's string quartets for the record label in 1980 also marked the end of this ensemble, as Suske became a member of the Gewandhaus Quartet again upon his return to Leipzig, whose first violinist he remained until 1993.  Family  Suske is married and has four grown children. His daughter Cornelia Smaczny is a harpist in the Gewandhaus Orchestra, and his son Conrad is deputy concertmaster there.

It is situated in the North Cascades, a subset of the Cascade Range. The nearest higher neighbor is Corteo Peak, to the northeast, and Black Peak is set to the north. Corteo Peak and Mount Benzarino were named by Forest Service surveyor, Lage Wernstedt, for the names of Basque sheepherders he met near these two mountains.June Burn, Bellingham Herald, January 27, 1932https://methownet.com/gristarchive/features/wernstedt.html Lage Wernstedt made the first ascent of Benzarino in 1926. Remnants of a small glacier hang on its north flank, and precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of Bridge Creek, which in turn is a tributary of the Stehekin River. Climate Mount Benzarino is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Agbandje-McKenna has dedicated her career to solving parvovirus structures using X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy and has done much of the initial work to elucidate the basic structure and function of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Her viral characterization and elucidation of antibody binding sites on AAV capsids has led to the development of viral capsid development and gene therapy approaches that evade immune detection and can be used to treat human diseases such as muscular dystrophies. Agbandje- McKenna was recognized with the 2020 American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy Outstanding Achievement Award for her contributions to the field.  Early life and education  Agbandje-McKenna was born in Nigeria. She lived with her grandmother in Nigeria until the age of 11 when the civil war broke out. At this point, she left Nigeria and moved to London where her parents lived at the time. Agbandje-McKenna conducted her undergraduate education at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield in the United Kingdom. She majored in Human Biology and Chemistry and obtained her Bachelor of Science, graduating with honors in 1985. Agbandje-McKenna then pursued her graduate training at the University of London Institute of Cancer Research. Her PhD training focused in Biophysics. Under the mentorship of Stephen Neidle, Agbandje- McKenna performed biophysical characterization of DNA-intercalating anthroquinone anti-tumor agents. During her PhD, she characterized the DNA binding characteristics of Anthracene-9,10-diones to explore their cytotoxic properties and potential in cancer therapy. She completed her PhD training in 1989, and then pursued her postdoctoral research at Purdue University in Indiana, United States. Agbandje-McKenna studied under the mentorship of Michael Rossmann within the Department of Biological Sciences. During this time, she began developing her skills in structural virology and became an Assistant Scientist in 1993 after completing her postdoctoral fellowship. She became an expert in the use of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the structure of viruses.  Career and research  Agbandje-McKenna moved back to the United Kingdom in 1995 to become an independent research fellow at the University of Warwick in England. She led her own laboratory in the Department of Biological Sciences until 1999. In 1999, Agbandje-McKenna joined the faculty at University of Florida within the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She also became a faculty within the Genetics Institute at the University of Florida. In 2005, Agbandje- McKenna was promoted to Associate Professor, and in 2009, she became a Full Professor as well as the Director of the Center for Structural Biology. Agbandje-McKenna is one of the principal investigators leading the Macromolecular Structure Group at UF alongside her husband, Robert McKenna. Her expertise in structural biology is used to guide her lab in the exploration of the structural topology of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using advanced and high resolution imaging techniques, such as cryogenic electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, her lab is able to determine the structure of AAV capsids and use this information to understand their life cycle and explore their potential use in gene therapy. Throughout her career at UF, Agbandje-McKenna has made key discoveries about the structure-function relationships of AAV vectors. Her rational capsid design has enabled the development of novel viral capsids with improved transduction and immune evading capabilities for use in gene therapies to treat various diseases. Agbandje-McKenna is actively involved in her scientific community both at UF and nationally. She is a member of the Health Science Center Equity and Diversity Board at UF, a member of the NIH NAAIDC, the ASGCT Viral Gene Transfer Vector Committee, on the Editorial Board for the journal Virology, a member of the ICTV Parvoviridae Study Group, as well as a member of the CHESS External Advisory Committee.  Adeno-associated virus structure-function characterization  Agbandje-McKenna explores parvovirus biology, with an emphasis on AAVs. The AAV serotypes offer exciting promise in biomedical application since they does not cause disease in humans and their single stranded genetic material can be easily edited to create vectors for use in gene therapy. In 1991, Agbandje-McKenna performed an X-ray crystallographic investigation of the Human Parvovirus B19. This was the first time that a self-assembled empty viral capsid grown in a atypical host system (baculovirus system) had been crystallized. In 1994, she officially characterized the structure of the Human Parvovirus B19 at 8 Angstrom resolution to find striking differences between the feline and canine homologous parvoviruses. In 2008, Agbandje-McKenna and her colleagues sought to find improved methods of AAV capsid design for gene therapy since current approaches require large amounts of vector to be effective. They discovered that a specific type of tyrosine kinase signalling impairs the transduction of AAV2, such that when the surface-exposed tyrosine residues on the viral capsid are phosphorylated, the virus can enter the cell, but not begin to express its genetic material. When they mutated the surface tyrosine residues on AAVs, it resulted in improved viral transduction. They were able to show that their novel capsid design enables sufficient viral transduction at lower doses. In 2018, Agbandje-McKenna and her collaborators at the Salk Institute developed a novel cryo-EM method to obtain viral structures at even higher resolution than previously obtained. They used a technique called contrast transfer function (CTF) as well as a correction for Ewald sphere curvature and they were able obtain the highest resolution structural analysis of AAV2 yet. Their structural characterization has resulted in improved models for AAV capsid development for use in gene therapy.  Immune evading viral capsids for gene therapy  In many patients, gene therapy is feasible due to the patient‚Äôs own immune system producing antibodies against the viral vector being used for treatment. Agbandje-McKenna and her colleagues at UF sought to find a way to prevent host mediated attack of vectors used in gene therapy. Since antibody binding sites are highly conserved across AAVs, they innovated a solution to the problem of host immune attack by designing a structure-guided evolution approach to identify antigenic epitopes on AAVs that are capable of evading neutralizing antibodies from the immune system. They elucidated an AAV1 capsid using this method that is able to evade neutralizing antibes while not compromising titer, transduction efficacy, or tissue tropisms and it evaded antibody binding in non-human primate samples as well as human samples. The following year, Agbandje-McKenna characterized a novel antigenic region in the AAV5 capsid at atomic resolution using cryo-EM. She further observed capsid- antibody interactions using cryo-EM at this high resolution and then was able to use her tool to develop novel antigens for AAV5 that evade the immune response. These discoveries and advances in generating immune-evading viral capsids for AAVs prompted Agbandje-McKenna to co-found the company Stridebio. Stridebio focuses on the design of antibody-evading AAV capsids to use in gene therapy for various diseases. Stridebio began collaborating with Takeda to innovate approaches for gene therapy for Friedrich Ataxia.

The long narrow components of the ecoregion follow the large rivers fed by snowmelt, and provide a critical habitat for migratory birds as they travel through the arid region. The vegetation is referred to as tugai, characterized by low tangles of trees and brush along the edges of the rivers and associated wetlands, and fed by groundwater instead of precipitation.  Location and description  Major river systems that support habitat for this ecoregion include: * The Syr Darya (River), which flows westward for over from the Tian Shan Mountains across eastern Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan to the Aral Sea. * The Amu Darya (River), which runs parallel to and south of the Syr Darya; the Amu Darya flows out of Afghanistan and Tajikistan northwest along the border of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. * The Murghab and Tejen Rivers that run across, and disappear into, the Karakum Desert of southeastern Turkmenistan. * The Ili River, which flows 1,500 km west from the Tian Shan Mountains of China to Lake Balkhash in southeast Kazakhstan. * The Zeravshan River, which rises on the edge of the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, and flows west towards the Amu Darya before disappearing in the desert. * The Vakhsh River, which flows across the middle of Tajikistan before emptying into the Amu Darya at the border with Afghanistan. * The Naryn River, which flows from the Tian Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan to the Syr Darya River in Uzbekistan.  Climate  The climate in the surrounding region is Cold desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (BWk)). This climate features hot desert conditions in the summer, but cooler than hot deserts. Winters are cold and dry. At least one month averages below . The snowmelt from nearby mountains produces flooding in spring through early summer, which is then followed by extremely arid conditions and an increase in soil salinity.  Flora and fauna  The woodlands of this ecoregion are a specialized complex of woody-shrubby vegetation known as tugai, which adapts to the extreme continental climate that experiences very hot summers and very cold winters. For all practical purposes there are no old-growth forests. Trees are typically poplars, willows, dzhidda (a type of silverberry, Elaeagnus oxycarpa), and Tamarix. Underbrush includes sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), barberry (Berberis), briar roses, honeysuckle, and Cotoneaster. Reeds and cattails are found extensively in the wetlands. The forest complexes of the ecoregion are often patchy, interspersed with steppe and swamp meadows. Protected areas Very little of this ecoregion is protected, by some estimates less than 2%. Officially protected areas include: * Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve, located where the Vakhsh River meets the Panj River to form the Amu Darya.

Her mother died when she was ten and she was educated well at Cheltenham Ladies College. She finished there in 1897 and Maude went up to Somerville College to come top of her class in science, but was denied an Oxford degree because she was a woman. She went on to study at London‚Äôs Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine for Women. She also gained a masters degree in Dublin (where women were allowed to have degrees). She then gained an MBBS from the University of London in 1906 and finally an M.D.  First World War  The war broke out in 1914 and at the end of that year she was in Belgium. In January 1915 she was in France, later at the first Maude Hospital run by her uncle and before the summer she was back in England.

Closing of the museum  For 3 years, the museum operated completely free of charge. Unfortunately, the museum was not supported by the state and officials over the years. The museum's founder, Reza Sarabi Agdam, said he had received only empty promises and encouragement from officials over the years. Although he received offers to sell his collections from several foreign countries and some major cities in Iran, the collector did not accept these offers. The Tabrizian collector, who collected old things and especially cameras with his own money without any help from any government agencies, was forced to collect exhibits from the Vocational Museum after 3 years because the municipality of Tabriz did not keep its promise to buy cameras. The museum was closed on May 18, 2020, International Museum Day. This incident caused public anger and discontent.

He is known for the play Virginia, produced at Drury Lane in 1754. Life He was baptised on 14 November 1707. His father Samuel Crisp, a London merchant, was a grandson of the theologian Tobias Crisp; his mother was Florence, daughter of Charles Williams. Crisp was educated at Eton College. By the age of thirteen he had lost both his parents; he was a residuary legatee and he is not known to have followed a profession. He led the life of a dilettante. He lived in Italy for a few years, studying art and music, returning in 1740. In England he knew Fulke Greville and the music historian Charles Burney. At the request of the Countess of Coventry he wrote the play Virginia, a tragedy based on the story of Appius and Verginia. The play was reluctantly accepted by David Garrick, who contributed prologue and epilogue, and in February 1754 it was produced at Drury Lane, where it ran for eleven nights. Although there was little open censure, it was felt that an experiment had been made on the patience of the public which would not bear repetition. When a few weeks later Virginia appeared in print, the critics, particularly in the Monthly Review, condemned plot, characters, and diction. Crisp, however, devoted himself to the task of revision, in the hope of being completely successful in the following year; but Garrick showed little disposition to bring the amended tragedy on the stage, and at length was obliged to return a decided refusal. Crisp was bitterly disappointed. \\"He became,\\" wrote Macaulay, \\"a cynic and a hater of mankind\\". He sought retirement with his friend Christopher Hamilton at the latter's country-house, Chessington Hall. He remained after Hamilton's death in 1759, as a boarder of Hamilton's unmarried sister Sarah. Crisp was frequently visited by his sister, Mrs Sophia Gast of Burford, Oxfordshire, by his old friend and prot√©g√© Charles Burney, and by Burney's family; he was a close friend of Burney's daughter, the writer Frances Burney, and advised her on her writing. He died at Chessington on 24 April 1783, aged 76, and was buried in the parish church. A marble tablet was erected to his memory bearing lines by Burney. He was unmarried.

It is a literary magazine‚Äîof particular interest to university students‚Äîstarted by Syed Akhtar Hussein Akhtar, a Punjabi Language Movement activist, in March 1965 and is associated with the Modern Punjabi College in Old Anarkali. Monthy Lehran started the practice of publishing content in both the Punjabi scripts, which has been praised for promoting a composite Punjabi culture and bridging the cultural divide between Pakistani and Indian Punjab. The practice has been co-opted by various other Punjabi writers from Pakistan. It is presently managed by Akhtar's children, Irfan and Kulsom Akhtar.  Background = Origins  The Lehran was founded by Syed Akhtar Hussein Akhtar, a pioneer in the Punjabi Language Movement, in March 1965 under the mentorship of Faqir Muhammad and noted Punjabi writers Abdul Hameed Amar, Hakeem Sher Muhammad Nasir and Khizar Tameemi. The cover of the first issue of the magazine was designed by painter, and later politician, Hanif Ramay. Lehran was attached with the Modern Punjabi College in Old Anarkali‚Äîalso founded by Akhtar‚Äîand students were required to subscribe to the magazine. Students also helped out with office affairs. According to Dawn, the Lehran filled the void for a Punjabi literary magazine for college students in Lahore created after the death of Chaudhary Muhammad Afzal, another educationist, who had also previously mentored Akhtar. In its early days, the Lehran published articles mainly related to the curricula of Akhtar's college and other general literary ones in Punjabi.  Gurmukhi transliteration  The Lehran was initially published in Shahmukhi, the Perso-Arabic script used for writing Punjabi in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. Shortly before 2005, Monthly Lehran started to transliterate its articles to Gurmukhi‚Äîthe Punjabi script used in Indian Punjab. It was a pioneer in this field, which was appropriated by many other Pakistani writers. The Lehran was praised for bridging a socio-cultural and religious divide between Pakistani and Indian Punjab by publishing content in both scripts used for the Punjabi language and for promoting a composite Punjabi culture. Akhtar also began to teach the Gurmukhi abugida to readers in Pakistani Punjab through instruction in the Lehran.

Meng, is a Chinese-born American virologist. He is a University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech. He studies emerging, re-emerging and zoonotic viruses of veterinary and human public health significance. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2016, a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in 2014, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2012.  Early life and education  Meng grew up in Gaomi, Shandong Province, China. He originally planned to pursue a career in chemical engineering, but instead he enrolled in Binzhou Medical College in 1980 as a medical student. Receiving his medical degree in 1985, Meng studied at the Wuhan University College of Medicine (formerly Hubei Medical College) and earned a Master's degree in Microbiology and Immunology. There, he discovered his passion and curiosity for virology, under the supervision of his graduate advisor, Yu Sun, who was an experimental virologist and pathologist. Earning his Master's in 1988, Meng worked as a research fellow for three years at the Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in Jinan. In 1991, he was admitted to the interdepartmental Immunobiology graduate program at the Iowa State University. His PhD dissertation focused on an emerging virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, in the laboratory of Prem S. Paul. After receiving his PhD in Immunobiology, he joined the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases as a John E. Fogarty Visiting Scientist and later as a Senior Staff Fellow in the labs of Suzanne U. Emerson and Robert H. Purcell at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland.  Career and research  Meng joined the faculty at Virginia Tech in 1999 as an Assistant Professor of Molecular Virology, and rose to the rank of Full Professor in 2007. He was named a University Distinguished Professor in 2013. His research mainly focuses on understanding the mechanism of virus replication and pathogenesis, defining the mechanisms of cross-species virus infection, and developing effective vaccines against emerging and zoonotic viruses. Meng's group discovered the swine hepatitis E virus from pigs and avian hepatitis E virus from chickens, which eventually lead to the recognition of human hepatitis E as a zoonotic disease. Meng's research also led to the invention of the first U.S. Department of Agriculture fully-license commercial vaccine, currently on the global market, against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and its associated diseases. Additionally, Meng works on a number of other important viruses including Hepatitis E virus, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Torque Teno Sus Virus, and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus. Meng has authored and co-authored more than 340 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, which have been cited for more than 28,300 times with a h-index of 89. He is ranked in the top 1% highly cited scientists in the field of microbiology (1997-2007) by Thomson Scientific's Essential Science Indicators. Meng is an inventor of more than 20 U.S. patent awards on viral vaccines and diagnostics.  Awards and honors  * 2018: The Inaugural Lorraine J.

Life  Born in Hamburg, J√∂de was the son of a master shoemaker.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945. CD-Rom-Lexikon, Kiel 2004, . After his studies, J√∂de first worked as a teacher at an Volksschule in Hamburg and joined the youth movement in 1916. At first he was a musical autodidact. Due to his achievements in the field of folk music, he was released from teaching duties to study musicology. In the years 1920 and 1921 J√∂de studied in Leipzig, mainly with Hermann Abert. Subsequently, J√∂de became a lecturer at the Royal Music Institute of Berlin in 1923. There he founded the first state youth music school in the same year. In 1926 J√∂de also initiated so-called open singing lessons. From 1930 he was entrusted with the direction of the seminar for folk and youth music at the academy, to which he was still affiliated. After the seizure of power by the Nazis in 1933, he was granted a leave of absence \\"until further notice\\". For this leave of absence, an article by Pfitzner biographer Walter Abendroth in the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger as well as others in the Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik and the Allgemeine Musikzeitung may have played a role. Furthermore, there was a \\"Declaration against J√∂de\\" in the latter two newspapers, which was signed by Hans Pfitzner, Paul Pretzsch, Heinz Pringsheim and Paul Schwers, among others. In 1934 Der Musikant: Lieder f√ºr die Schule,Der Musikant: Lieder f√ºr die Schule on WorlddCat edited by J√∂de was published by Georg Kallmeyer Verlag (Wolfenb√ºttel, Berlin 1934). The songbook is divided into seven chapters. 1\\\\. \\"Kinderlieder und Spiele: teilweise mit einem Melodieinstrument\\" () 2\\\\. \\"Bunte Lieder: hin und wieder mit freien zweiten Stimmen und mit Instrumenten\\" () 3\\\\. \\"Alte und neue Lieder: f√ºr Einzel-, Wechsel- und Chorgesang, einstimmig, zweistimmig und mit Instrumenten\\" () 4\\\\. \\"Volks- und Kunstliede [sic!]: meist mit polyphonem Satz mit und ohne Instrumentalbegleitung\\" () 5\\\\. \\"Lieder und Ges√§nge: von Praetorius, Scheidt, Sch√ºtz, H√§ndel, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Bruckner und anderen Meistern mit und ohne Instrumentalbegleitung\\" () 6\\\\. \\"Ein- und mehrstimmige Ges√§nge mit und ohne Instrumentalbegleitung von Joh. Seb. Bach\\" () 7\\\\. \\"Deutschland im Lied\\" (pages 387 to 418) In the last chapter Deutschland im Lied the title picture is marked with a swastika. Here are songs that propagate the strengthening of Hitler Germany, for example Heinrich Spitta (1933): Erwachen, Canon for two voices after words by Friedrich Schiller (1798): \\"Und setzet ihr nicht das Leben ein, nie wird euch das Leben gewonnen sein.\\"\\" and by Otto Riethm√ºller (1933): Deutschlands Erwachen (set by Heinrich Spitta), in which the 3rd verse goes: \\"Stand einst ein graues Heer, rang von den Alpen zum Meer. K√§mpfe du mit f√ºr das k√ºnftige Land, Arbeit und Freiheit f√ºr jeglichen Stand. K√§mpferland, Hitlerland, schirm dich Gottes Hand\\" (Once there was a grey army, struggling from the Alps to the sea. Fight with us for the future land, work and freedom for all classes. Fighter country, Hitler country, shield yourself from the hand of God). Due to disciplinary proceedings in October 1936, J√∂de was relieved of all offices with effect from 26 February 1937; also some of his writings were banned. In 1937, however, he became head of the Munich Youth Radio and in 1938 head of the Hitlerjugend playing group there. From 1939 to 1945 he worked as a teacher at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. On 1 January 1940 he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (member number 7.792.080). From 1940 to 1944 he was also the editor of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Spielmusik. J√∂de, who had lived in Bad Reichenhall since 1941, first became director of the local Protestant church choir after the end of the Second World War in 1945. From 1947 to 1952 he was director of the Office for Youth and School Music in Hamburg. From 1951 to 1953, also in Hamburg, he directed the subject of music education at the Academy of Music. He then went to Trossingen to head the International Institute for Youth and Folk Music. In 1957 J√∂de was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. J√∂de died at the age of 83 on 19 October 1970 in Hamburg. He was buried at the Nienstedten Cemetery. J√∂de's pedagogical principles had grown out of the youth music movement. His aim was to create \\"a singing youth\\" and \\"a singing people\\". The (school) child should also be looked after outside school. Open singing lessons at markets and squares in the big cities were intended to build up a sense of community and to fight against pop songs and jazz, as well as to protest against \\"bourgeois hypocrisy of art\\" in opera houses and concert halls. J√∂de's main principle was: \\"Even making music is better than listening to music.\\" So his main concern was to stimulate the youth.

The blowout occurred at Well No. 5 in the Baghjan Oil Field, resulting in a leak of natural gas. The leaking well subsequently caught fire, and has resulted in two deaths, large- scale local evacuations, and environmental damage to the nearby Dibru-Saikhowa National Park. As of 3 September 2020, the blowout has not been controlled, and continues to burn. Assam's Commerce and Industry Minister, C. M. Patowary has stated that it may take another two months to control the leak. On 13 September 2020, Oil India succeeded in diverting some of the leaking gas to flare pits, but has yet to completely control the leak and 'kill' the well.  Background = Location and environmental conditions  The Baghjan Oil Field is located in Tinsukia district in the State of Assam, near Baghjan village, which has a resident population of 4,488 persons. The nearest towns are Doom Dooma and Tinsukia. Baghjan Oil Field is located near the Dibru- Saikhowa National Park in Assam, and is also in proximity to Maguri Motapung Beel, a natural wetland. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is the only riverine island wildlife reserve, globally. It contains a variety of rare and endangered species, including the Gangetic dolphin, which is endangered, as well as herds of wild horses, tigers, capped langurs, hoolock gibbons, slow loris, and several rare butterflies and fish. The Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is also connected to Namdapha National Park via the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary. These regions are part of the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot. Baghjan Well No. 5, from which the leak occurred, is located at a distance of 900 meters from the park and adjoins a buffer forested region surrounding the park. It is also close to the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot. On 18 January 2020, the Central Government exempted all oil and gas firms conducting exploratory drilling from legal requirements for environmental clearances.{{Cite newslast=Koshyfirst=Jacobdate=2020-01-18title=Centre waives green clearance for onshore and offshore oil and gas explorationwork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and- environment/centre-waives-green-clearance-for-onshore-and-offshore-oil-and- gas-exploration/article30595276.eceaccess-date=2020-09-08} Prior to the leak, in 2020, the region witnessed protests after the Government of India announced that they had authorized Oil India Limited to explore the area under Dibru- Saikhowa National Park for hydrocarbons. During May 2020, prior to and during the leak, Tinsukia district in Assam experienced heavy rains and flooding in two local rivers, Dibru and Lohit. The region was also placed in lockdown, following the COVID-19 pandemic in India.  Environmental authorizations  A subsequent investigation by Assam's State Pollution Control Board found that Oil India Limited had begun drilling at the Baghjan Oil Field without obtaining prior environmental clearances in accordance with legal requirements under the Water (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act 1981 and Environment Protection Act, 1986. Oil India Limited had also failed to conduct mandatory public hearings before beginning drilling. The Eco-Sensitive Zone around Dibru-Saikhowa National Park was reduced in size at the request of Oil India Limited in order to allow the well to be established. In 2013, the Baghjan Oil Field was inspected by a team from the National Board for Wildlife, which criticised the Government of India for ratifying the breach of wildlife norms after Oil India Corporation had already begun operating in an eco-sensitive zone.{{Cite newslast=Adlakhafirst=Nidhidate=2020-04-28title=The curious case of India‚Äôs environment ministrywork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/sci- tech/energy-and-environment/how-the-ministry-of-environment-forest-and- climate-change-has-been-making-inroads-into-indias- forests/article31454680.eceaccess-date=2020-09-08}  Prior leaks  In 2005, a blowout at an Oil India Limited well in Dikom in Assam resulted in the evacuation of 500 families. The leak subsequently caught fire, as well. On 3 February 2020 near Naharkatia in Assam, a stretch of the Burhi Dihing river, which is a tributary to the Brahmaputra river, caught fire after a punctured pipeline carrying crude oil from to the Indian Oil headquarters at Duliajan in Assam leaked, covering the water with a film of oil. The fire burned for a period of 48 hours before the leak was repaired and it could be extinguished.{{Cite newslast=Karmakarfirst=Rahuldate=2020-02-03title=Watch Assam river burns for two days after crude oil spillagework=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-river-on- fire-for-two-days-after-crude-oil-spillage/article30724994.eceaccess- date=2020-09-08} Oil India officials stated that a technical error with their instruments had caused shut off valves in a storage tank to close, resulting in pressure building up in a pipeline carrying crude oil. This caused several leaks in the pipeline. Oil India Officials blamed local residents for causing the fire, and stated that a number of leaks had previously occurred, as parts of attempts to steal quantities of crude oil from the delivery pipeline. The Central Pollution Control Board had directed Assam's State Pollution Control Board to investigate the damage to aquatic life and local environment caused by the leak.  Drilling at Baghjan 5 Well  The Baghjan Oil Field has 21 active wells, of which 4 produce natural gas, while the remaining produce oil. Baghjan Oil Field's Well No. 5 was established in 2006 and produces natural gas. It drills down to a depth of 3,870 meters, and was producing between 80,000 to 100,000 standard cubic meters of gas per day before the leak. Drilling at the Baghjan 5 well, where the leak occurred, was being outsourced to an Ahmedabad-based firm, John Energy. In May 2020, a new reservoir was being tapped for additional production at a depth of 3,729 meters, with workover operations taking place In addition, the infrastructure for the previous reservoir was being serviced, due to which production had been temporarily stopped. A device for pressure control, known as a blowout preventer, had been temporarily uninstalled while the extraction assembly was being serviced. In April 2020, following a lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India, Oil India suspended drilling at several of the wells in the Baghjan Oil Field, primarily because of the unavailability of employees. On 20 May 2020, before the leak, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change announced that they would be authorizing exploration for hydrocarbons under the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, at seven different locations. Oil India Corporation stated that they would be using Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) to explore these wells without entering the National Park itself. Baghjan Oil Well 5, at which the leak occurred, will be one of the bases on which the ERD will extend under the National Park.  Blowout, leak, and fire = Initial occurrence  On 27 May 2020, at 10:30 a.m., residents of Baghjan village in Assam reported hearing a loud sound from the nearby Baghjan Oil Field. Reports of the sound of the explosion were also confirmed from residents of Tinsukia town, which is located at a distance of 12 kilometres from the Oil Field. Local newspaper, the Sentinel, reported local accounts indicating that the gushing of natural gas from the well continued to produce an audible sound over the next few days. Although production had been temporarily stopped at Baghjan's Well No. 5 to explore a new sand, and to service the well, workers noticed that gas was escaping from the capped well, and had begun to evacuate the Oil Field before the incident. At 10:30 a.m, the blowout occurred, resulted in the leak of natural gas from the well, and causing a complete suspension in operations. Oil India Limited's official statement indicated that the well had \\"suddenly became very active\\" while workover operations were ongoing. OIL officials confirmed that the leak occurred from the existing sand which had been capped to allow exploration of the new sand. This resulted in a \\"fountain of crude oil\\" from the sand. The leaked gas consisted of a naturally occurring mix of propane, methane, propylene and other gases.  Fires  On 9 June 2020, Well No. 5 caught fire after efforts to cap the leak were unsuccessful. An official from Oil India Limited stated, \\"We cannot say how and why it happened,\\" in regard to the fire, also noting that fires, in the case of a blowout, were not unexpected. The fire occurred at the plinth of the well while cleaning operations were under way. Following the fire, people who had not yet been evacuated from the local area left, as the fire spread to local grasslands. The fire quickly spread to a larger area and burned down nearby trees, crops and houses. 4 persons were injured, and 50 houses destroyed in the resulting fire. The Tinsukia District Collector stated that the condensate from the gas leak in surrounding areas had made the locale more vulnerable to fire and had allowed the fire to spread faster. On 10 June 2020, two firefighters, Durlov Gogoi and Tikheswar Gohain died fighting the fire. Their bodies were recovered from a water body near the site. Recently on 21 July 2020, an explosion occurred at the well number 5 and three foreign experts were injured in the incident.  Evacuation  Following the leak, 1610 local families, consisting of approximately 3000 persons were evacuated to relief camps. A safety zone consisting of a 1.5 km radius around the well was established. The National Disaster Relief Force was deployed to establish the relief camps. In addition to local residents, employees of Indian Oil India Limited and their families were also evacuated from the area. The Indian Air Force and Indian Army also provided assistance.  Environmental damage  State Pollution Control Board officials stated that the leaked gas condensate had affected local agricultural crops and plants, including bamboo, tea, bananas and betel nuts. Wind conditions had carried the leaked gas towards the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park as well. On 29 May 2020, the carcass of a Gangetic dolphin covered in condensated oil was found in the Maguri Motapung Beel, a local wetland, and sent for a post-mortem by the Tinsukia Wildlife Division, to establish the cause of death. Wildlife Division officials noted that because of rain immediately following the leak, local waterbodies had been contaminated by condensate from the leak. On 31 May 2020, Assam Government officials confirmed that the State Pollution Control Board was investigating environmental damage as a result of the leak. Following the leak, the State Forest Department had also asked the Indian Oil India Limited to account for its actions after reports of dead fish in local waterbodies. On 5 June 2020, local residents protested near the Maguri Motapung Beel wetland, calling for the protection of the ecologically-sensitive Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, to mark World Environment Day, and called for compensation for their loss of livelihoods as a result of the leak.  Efforts to contain and stem the leak = Initial response  Operations at Baghjan Oil Field were suspended following the blowout and leakage of natural gas. IOC requested assistance from the Crisis Management Team of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India. IOC initially attempted to install a blowout preventer to bring the leak under control. OIL also sprayed the area with water.{{Cite newsdate=2020-05-27title=Blowout at OIL well in Assamwork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/blowout-at-oil- well-in-assam/article31688007.eceaccess-date=2020-09-08} On 30 May 2020, four days after the initial leak, a spokesperson from Indian Oil India Limited confirmed that \\"The well control operation is yet to start.\\" Indian Oil India Limited officials also stated that the process of controlling the well would take time, and that they were currently making arrangements to secure a water supply to help mitigate the leak.  Attempts to cap the well  Placing a blowout preventer = In June 2020, Oil India Limited officials stated that they had constructed a temporary reservoir of water in the vicinity of the well, by placing pipes from the Dangori river. Water from the reservoir would be used to spray on to the well area to protect workers while they attempted to place a blowout preventer, using hydraulic devices, followed by injecting mud to completely shut down production of gas, or \\"kill\\" the well. Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control experts were called in to assist with the process. Initial efforts to control the leak were delayed because of severe flooding in Assam, which caused widespread damage and resulted in the deaths of 16 persons. Oil India Limited said that because of the floods, working conditions at the Oil Field were temporarily unsafe, as the Dangori river which was being used to pump water to the field, was overflowing. The nearby Doom Dooma-Baghjan bridge had collapsed due to the flooding, and consequently, access roads to the site were unavailable. There were two failed attempts to place the blowout preventer on Well No. 5. On 22 July 2020, during one such attempt, three Singaporean expert advisors were injured after a fire broke out.{{Cite newsdate=2020-07-22title=3 foreign experts injured in Baghjan blowout well accidentwork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3-foreign- experts-injured-in-baghjan-blowout-well-accident/article32162187.eceaccess- date=2020-09-08} On 18 August 2020, a blowout preventer was successfully placed at the well head on a third attempt, but the process of 'killing the well' by injecting mud to completely stop production of natural gas from the well was not successful, and the well continued to leak. Oil India Limited officials stated that the reason for the failure was that a valve in the well casing collapsed.{{Cite newsdate=2020-08-19title=Operation to ‚Äòkill‚Äô blowout gas well at Assam‚Äôs Baghjan suspendedwork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/operation-to- kill-blowout-gas-well-at-assams-baghjan-suspended/article32389974.eceaccess- date=2020-09-08} = Snubbing and diversion = On 3 September 2020, Assam's Commerce and Industry Minister, C. M. Patowary informed the Assam Legislative Assembly that experts from Canada had been brought in to attempt to cap the well again. Oil India Limited's officials stated that the Corporation is also considering an attempt to divert the gas produced at Well No. 5 into two separate channels. If successful, this will result the diversion of part of the gas being produced to the Baghjan Early Production System facility, while the remaining gas will be flared. Once the diversion has occurred, an attempt will be made to cap the well at a greater depth, in a process called snubbing. On 13 September 2020, Oil India Limited succeeded in diverting the gas leaking from Well No. 5 to nearby flare pits on a second attempt. The first attempt at such a diversion had been unsuccessful. The well has not as yet been controlled, and on 30 September 2020, Sushil Chandra Mishra, the managing director of OIL stated that it would take two more months to kill the well and stop the leak.  Consequences = Fatalities and evacuations  Two firefighters employed by Oil India Limited died on 10 June 2020 while fighting the fire resulting from the gas leak. Four other fire fighters suffered injuries.{{Cite newsdate=2020-06-11title=Assam CM orders probe into Baghjan gas well firework=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other- states/assam-cm-orders-probe-into-baghjan-gas-well- fire/article31802561.eceaccess-date=2020-09-08} Local reports indicate that there have been more deaths in the area; an inquiry by a local magistrate is currently investigating these claims. On 10 September 2020, an engineer working with Oil India Limited, Arnab Kishore Bordoloi, died while working at the well site. The cause of death is yet to be established. As of September 2020, 500 persons are currently still residing in relief camps, with the surrounding area still being affected by audible sounds of the gas leak as well as the ongoing fire. Local reports indicate that the sound of the leak can be heard from a distance of 5 kilometres from the site of the leak.  Litigation and compensation  On 25 June 2020, the National Green Tribunal found a prima facie case had been made out against Oil India Limited for damage to the environment and local livelihoods because of the leak. The Tribunal ordered Oil India Limited to deposit a sum of 250 million with the District Magistrate of Tinsukia towards compensation, and constituted an expert committee to investigate the disaster and recommend how much compensation was payable to affected persons. The expert committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal recommended that completely damaged houses would result in compensation of 2,500,000, while those that were severely and moderately damaged would receive 1,000,000 and 250,000 each. From 24 August 2020 onwards, local residents staged a peaceful protest, establishing a camp in front of the office of the local Deputy Commissioner, to ensure that all persons whose homes were damaged in the fire and leak received more compensation. The Assam Government confirmed to the Assam Legislative Assembly that some families had been issued compensation. Oil India Limited had filed objections to these orders for compensation in the National Green Tribunal, but the Tribunal dismissed their objections on 8 August 2020.{{Cite newsothers=PTIdate=2020-08-08title=Baghjan well fire  NGT rejects objections raised by Oil Indiawork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/baghjan-well- fire-ngt-rejects-objections-raised-by-oil-india/article32302754.eceaccess- date=2020-09-08} OIL announced that they will give ‚Çπ30,000 as compensation to all those families who are affected. On 1 October 2020, the Gauhati High Court agreed to hear a public interest litigation petition filed by two local residents, and ordered OIL as well as a number of government authorities, including the Assam Government, the National Board for Wildlife, the State Board for Wildlife, and the State and Central Boards for Pollution Control, to respond to concerns raised about drilling inside the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park.  Internal investigation and criticism  On 30 May 2020, an Oil India Limited spokesperson stated to press that a five-member investigative committee had been established to ascertain the causes of the blowout and leak. On 10 June 2020, Oil India Limited confirmed that two employees had been placed on suspension in connection with the leak. The Indian Oil Workers Union criticized the use of private contractors at Well No.5, calling on Oil India Limited to use only trained corporation employees for such work.  Government investigations and environmental damage  The initial leak at the Baghjan Oil Field resulted in the contamination of water bodies in the nearby Maguri Motapung Beel wetland, as well as in the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park. Days after the leak, local forest officials reported seeing a layer of gas condensate on water bodies in the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park. An Environmental Impact Assessment Report is currently being prepared to assess the damage caused by the leak and fire. On 12 June 2020, the Assam state government ordered an investigation into the environmental impact of the leak, and asked for a report within a month. On 21 June 2020, Assam's State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) ordered Oil India Limited to shut down all production at the Baghjan Oil Field, following an investigation that revealed that the Corporation had begun drilling operations there without obtaining prior environmental clearances. The SPCB also found that the Corporation had failed to comply with continuing reporting and certification requirements under environmental laws. Oil India Limited objected to this notice of closure, stating that it could potentially result in more blowouts at the wells.{{Cite newslast=Karmakarfirst=Rahuldate=2020-06-21title=Baghjan blaze: Closure of wells may lead to more blowouts, warns OILwork=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/baghjan-blaze-closure-of- wells-may-lead-to-more-blowouts-warns-oil/article31882416.eceaccess- date=2020-09-08} The closure notification was withdrawn three days after it was issued. The Indian Government's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has also ordered an investigation into the gas leak. On 2 August 2020, the Wildlife Institute of India, which operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a report in which they stated that Oil India Limited had failed to address security concerns after two previous leaks in Dikom and Naharkatia in Assam. Their report indicated that between 60 to 70 hectares of land had been damaged by the leak, and noted particular concerns about the biodiversity in the Tinsukia district.{{Cite newsdate=2020-08-02title=Lesson not learnt from earlier Assam blowouts: Wildlife Institutework=The Hinduurl=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lesson-not- learnt-from-earlier-assam-blowouts-wildlife- institute/article32253806.eceaccess-date=2020-09-08} The Wildlife Institute of India's report stated that the leak would have \\"....prolonged ill effects on all life forms, including humans,\\" in the area.

His father was Costas Stamatiou () and his mother was Melo (). At the age of 15, he became an orphan. In 1682 A.D., he went to Istanbul, where he worked in a tavern.  Life = Uprising  According to the Orthodox Church, Saint Apostolos had already been in Constantinople for four years when the inhabitants of his homeland were oppressed under heavy taxation.https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/08/holy-new-martyr-apostolos- young-1686.html Because of this, he decided to turn to the Sultan's commissioners and taught them how to reduce the tax burden. Apostolos helped his brethren set up their own committee of residents who would represent them. This was a success, but Voivode did not accept the documents of his sultan's commissioners, rejecting them as forgeries. Voivode arrested three of the residents' committee and took them to Istanbul himself, where he demanded they be imprisoned for high treason.  Confinement  When their compatriots learned of this, they sent a committee to Istanbul with the intention of addressing the queen mother herself (the Sultan's mother - Valide Hanoum Kiosem) to get them released. As they did not know how and where to go, Apostolos was willing to help them, since he also knew the Turkish language. He even took the report written by the residents and gave it to a top Sultan official. The official, however, had already received orders from Voivode of Pelion. Apostolos was arrested and handed over to Voivode to be punished for his arrogance. Voivode then ordered him to be chained and asked Apostolos for a four-year Hara√ß for as long as he was away from his village. However, because he feared that the rest of the committee would appeal to the queen mother herself, he thought of finally leaving the three prisoners and the Saint. But a compatriot of the Saint, out of envy that an insignificant and poor child would be considered a benefactor of his place, slandered him that he had instigated the whole affair and that if he had set him free he would surely badmouth Voivode in the royal palace. So Voivode ordered that he be severely tortured to death.  The struggle for Islamization  After a failed attempt to escape, Voivode tried to convert Saint Apostolos to Islam by circumcising him, but Voivode was unsuccessful. After Apostolos declared that he was a Christian and his faith would not change, he was led to senior religious officials where they themselves tried to make him change his faith by giving him wealth and glory. Apostolos did not renounce his Christian faith. He only told them: \\"Don't waste your time, do whatever it takes but do it quickly. Whatever death you give me, I will willingly accept it for the sake of my Christ. So don't be late. Do you want to burn me? Let me gather the wood and prepare the fire. Do you want to hang me? Let me prepare the loop with my own hands. Do you want to behead me? Give me the sword and I will sharpen it as needed.\\" After they didn't achieve anything, the vizier finally ordered his beheading.  The execution  After a night of torture, Apostolos was led before dawn to a location near Golden Horn where he waited for the executioner to behead him. The executioner first hit him three times in the neck with his scythe, then grabbed him by the hair and beheaded him. Apostolos died at the age of 19. Books were written about the Saint's life state that after his execution, the execution squad saw from afar a large crowd going to his dead body. Believing that they were Christians, the men ran to the site but could see nothing. Only his dead body was there and no one else. After they threw his body into the sea, they brought his head to the vizier as proof of his execution.  After execution  Christians who had seen his execution demanded his head so that it be buried, through the Patriarchate. When it was given to them, they put it in a silver case and gave it to the Holy Temple of Agios Dimitrios in Kurtulu≈ü. Sometime later, a compatriot of Apostolos took his head and carried it to his homeland, specifically to the house of the Saint (which had now become a temple in his honor). Today, his head is in the Holy Diocese of Dimitriada, Magnesia.  Veneration  Orthodox Church considers him a saint and he is commemorated on August 16.

He was the first African appointee at the United Nations. He served as the Secretary to the cabinet in the first Convention People's Party government which shared the colony's administration with the colonial government. He also served as Ghana's ambassador to the United States of America and Ghana's permanent representative to the United Nations. In 1958, he became the first Ghanaian headmaster of Achimota College. Born in Keta, a town in the Volta Region of Ghana, Chapman had his early education in his hometown, Keta and briefly in Togo. He entered Achimota School to train as a teacher through unusual circumstances and taught at his alma mater, Achimota College prior to entering Oxford University for his bachelor's degree. He returned as a senior tutor at Achimota College taking up other roles in the school. Aside academia, Chapman developed strong interest in the sociopolitical situation of the people of his hometown and the Ewe ethnic group at large. He advocated for the unification of the Ewe people who had been dispersed into different colonial administrations by the colonial powers of the time. He was a founding member of the All-Ewe Conference (AEC) and also served as its first secretary. Through his engagements as a member of the conference, he gained appointment at the United Nations, becoming one of the earliest Africans to serve on the world's most powerful intergovernmental organization. In 1954, Chapman returned to the Gold Coast to work as Secretary to the then Prime Minister of the Gold Coast, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. He served in that capacity until 1957 when he was made Ghana's ambassador to the United States of America. While serving in that post, he also doubled as Ghana's permanent representative to the United Nations. Following the exit of the last expatriate Headmaster of Achimota College in 1958, Chapman returned to the school as its first Ghanaian and African Headmaster. He held this appointment until 1963. Chapman returned to the United Nations once more, and also served on various boards in Ghana following the 1966 coup d'√©tat. Chapman spent most of his retirement years as a consultant and a small scale farmer. He was also engaged in the activities of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences of which he was a member. Chapman died in 2001 at the age of 92. Early life=Family background Chapman was born on 5 July 1909 at Keta, a town in the Volta Region of Ghana to Jane Atsiamesi Chapman, (n√©e Atriki) and Mr. William Chapman, a merchant and the brother of Chief James Ocloo I of Keta who served as an adviser to the paramount chief of the Anlo state, Togbi Amedor Kpeglo (1879-1906) of the Bate clan. His father, Mr. William Chapman (also known by the name, Klutse) was the son of Nyaho and grandson of Sokpui, chief of Dzelukope. His father (Klutse) was one of the first natives of the Anlo state to attend Cape Coast Castle School and it was there that he became known by the name William Henry Chapman. The name Chapman subsequently became surname used by all the children of William Henry Chapman which included Daniel Ahmling Chapman. However, after a series of events, one in which he was asked by an American whether he did not have an African name; the other when his son was unable to gain admission into Oxford University the year he applied because authorities of the university mistakened him for an Englishman, and all places available for Englishmen had been taken leaving only vacancies for foreigners and consequently told he would be considered for admission in the next year. Daniel Ahmling Chapman resolved in 1964 to add his Grandfather's name Nyaho to his name, he became Daniel Ahmling Chapman Nyaho. He lost his father at the age of seven. Early education His formal education begun at the Bremen Mission School at Keta. In 1919 he spent the school year at Lome he however returned to resume schooling at Keta. At the age of nine he learnt to play the harmonium through the aid of a primer written in Ewe by the Bremen Missionaries. At the age of ten he was able to join the nearby AME Zion church congregation in evening services to play the harmonium. It was around this period that one of his brothers arranged for him to have violin lessons. While at senior school, he helped his headmaster teach hymns, anthems and other songs to his school mates for the purposes of important occasions such as Good Friday, Easter, Christmas, Empire Day or school concerts. By standard four (primary 4 or grade 4) he had begun nurturing dreams of becoming a teacher and later a catechist and a religious minister. At the period of his days in primary school, there were no secondary schools or training colleges in the Volta Region, secondary school education in Cape Coast were also beyond the financial means of many parents in the village. His original plan was to enter the Presbyterian Training College at Akropong to train as a teacher however, his focus changed to Achimota College due to the astir generated by Dr. Kwegyir Aggrey in the 1920s. His admiration for Dr. Kwegyir Aggrey was one of the reasons why he aspired to become a teacher by profession and his dream of entering Achimota College was a result of him (Dr. Aggrey) becoming vice principal of the school. Another reason for his choice was the opportunity of enrolling in the school on a scholarship, thus not paying school fees and also receiving stipends while in school. Chapman consequently set site for Accra to stay with one Carl Dey in hopes of enrolling in a school in Accra to sit for his Standard Seven School Leaving Examination and secure a scholarship to study at Achimota College. Things however could not go as planned as his school authorities in Keta were unable to send him a transfer certificate to enable him to enrol in a school in Accra. Chapman decided to returned to Keta but prior to his return he wrote a letter to the Director of Education which read: > \\"Dear Sir, I wish to go to Achimota College. If you send me I will work very > hard\\". All hopes of attending Achimota College at the period seemed lost when Arthur Bolton, the head of the Teacher Training Department of Achimota College confirmed that Chapman was not qualified to enter Achimota College under the circumstances. Chapman later received a telegram from the Education Department in Accra which read in part: > \\"Chapman's name added to Bolton's list. Apply for Bond Form, from the > Director of Schools.\\" Mr. Bolton who doubled as the director of schools visited Keta to interview candidates who wanted to enter Achimota College from the AME Zion School and the Roman Catholic School and Mr. Jiagge, a former class teacher of Chapman ceased the opportunity to narrate the ordeal of his former pupil to Bolton. Bolton could not help at that moment however, in the same year, the Education Department of the Gold Coast had organised an essay competition as part of the visit of the Prince of Wales to the country and Chapman's essay won the first prize in 1925. Bolton saw Chapman's name and recalled the story of Chapman as narrated to him by Mr. Jiagge and therefore decided to waive the prerequisit Standard Seven Certificate in Chapman's case to enroll him at Achimota College on a scholarship. Teacher training In 1926, Chapman entered Achimota College which was then known as the Government Teachers' Training College prior to 1927. There, he was a year behind his brother Charles Chapman and Philip Gbeho, the famous musician, composer and educationist. Some of his tutors included; Rev A. G. Fraser (the first principal of the school), Dr. J. E. K. Aggrey the first Assistant Vice-Principal who taught him history), W. E. F. Ward, D. T. Adams and Douglas Benzies. In school, he often won awards for his academic performance. He was a student of George Steven, the art teacher who was responsible for the illustrations in R.S. Rattray's; Ashanti Folk Tales. The mouse on the cover of the book was his art work. He completed his studies in 1929 with distinctions in three subjects: Woodwork, Music and Teaching and missed a distinction in arts by a mark. Aside his regular academic subjects, Chapman gained interest and took courses in wood-work, beaten metal work, and music. While in school Chapman participated in other extra-curricular activities including serving as the secretary of the College Social Service Society, teaching some of the young boys shorthand at the college's Accra Boys, serving as the first prefect of Guggisberg House and becoming the Entertainment Secretary of the college in 1929. He was able to pass both the School Certificate and Teacher Training examinations despite all the engagements. Teaching career and tertiary education=Government Boys' School and return to Achimota College Chapman begun his teaching career in January 1931 at the Government Boys' School in Accra. While in his third year Achimota College, Douglas Benzies, his housemaster encouraged him to consider studying the secondary school subjects leading to the Cambridge School Certificate concurrently with his teacher training course. He therefore spent the nights studying for the London Matriculation Examination while he taught wood work during the day. After six months of teaching in the school, he was transferred back to Achimota College at the request of the school to become a junior member of staff working as an assistant music master working with Mr W. E. F. Ward who was the music master. He also taught; Woodwork, Art and Ewe (language, custom and institutions). At Achimota College, he sought for permission to study with the regular intermediate degree students and with the assistance of former housemaster and class teachers he prepared for the London University Intermediate B.A. degree. He obtained his University of London Intermediate B.A. in English, Latin, Economics and Geography in 1932. Studies at Oxford University and return to Achimota College As a junior member of the staff, he served as an assistant housemaster. Chapman taught in the school for three years and in 1934 he was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Oxford. There, he studied at St. Peter's Hall (now St. Peter's College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford). The schorlaship scheme had been introduced by the Achimota Council in 1931 to send deserving students of the School to Oxford University and later Cambridge University to acquire further education and training similar to the type of training European administrators and senior officers received prior to their appointments in the colonies. The first recipient of the scholarship was Modjaben Dowuona. Following his results in the intermediate bachelor's degree examination and his commitment to other engagements of the school, the school's council awarded him the schorlaship in 1933. Chapman was inspired to pursue Geography at undergraduate level by a Geography tutor and author called D. T. Adams. He passed his preliminary courses and went on to obtain a second Class Honours in Geography, consequently becoming the first Gold Coast native to obtain a bachelor's degree in Geography. Following his graduation as an undergraduate, he pursued a postgraduate programme in Pre-historic Archaeology prior to his return to Achimota School in 1937 where he took up a job as a senior Geography master. In addition to teaching Geography, Chapman was responsible for other administrative tasks, he supervised students' vacation teaching practice, served as a housemaster, a librarian, the secretary to the Principal's Advisory Committee and the staff representative on the Achimota College Council. He also took up a task of an Ewe language examiner for the Cambridge University School Certificate Examination. Eweland advocacy and first UN appointment=Eweland advocacy While a teacher at Achimota College, Chapman was quite concerned with the social and political issues of the people of his hometown and the Ewe people at large. In 1939 he planned on opening a secondary school he hoped would have been completed and named Keta College. He completed a building started by his brother hoping it would serve as the nucleus of the college. He bought desks and chairs, and ordered and received consignments of the books for the college. He later gave up on the plan when the Director of Education was given the power to close down schools at his own discretion. At Achimota College, he experienced the consequences of the division of the Ewe people into different various colonial and political factions. During the Second World War, his bungalow hosted many Ewe people from Togo under French Mandate who had fled into the Gold Coast for political and economic reasons. Many others had gone to settle at Anumle, a village nearby. Chapman began writing about the problems Ewe people faced due to this division in 1944. By January 1945 he had started discussions with his elder brother, C. H. Chapman, Philip Gbeho (also a tutor at Achimota College), S. S. Newlands, an employee of the United Africa Company and others on the ways and means through which the Ewe people of French Togoland could be helped and also united. Through these discussions Chapman was inspired to start a publication on the Ewes. The maiden issue of the Ewe Newsletter appeared on the news stands in May 1945 and its readers were exhorted in the following words: \\"The time has come for us to make a careful study of our problems and look ahead into the future. Today Eweland is divided into a western zone under British rule, and an eastern zone under French rule. Experience and the march of events have taught us that we of the whole of Eweland. We feel the effects of the partition of our people but the colonial powers hold the key to the problem. For our part, however, it is essential that we should achieve without delay, mutual trust and cooperation within each state and among the various Ewe states\\". The newsletter was intended to enhance Ewe cultural consciousness and foster unity amongst its people. In addition to the newsletter, Chapman together with some friends published the Nuke Xletivi, an ewe publication. These two publications supplemented with publications such as Jonathan Savi de Gove's Le Guide du Togo helped its readers understand the trusteeship system and the problems associated with it. Through these publications, a number of Ewe businessmen and teachers from the three Ewe territories; British Togoland, French Togoland and Trans-Volta Togoland met on 31 December 1945 in Accra (what became known be the first All-Ewe Conference). The purpose of the meeting was to send a resolution on unification of Ewe people to the various metropolitan countries of Britain. The resolution stated as follows: \\"We, the undersigned, who are Ewes from various parts of the Eweland (i.e. Southeast Gold Coast, South Togoland under British Mandate and South Togo under French Mandate) have given much thought to the problems of the Ewe people with special reference to the partition of our country. We have always strongly supported our chiefs in their petitions asking for the removal of the frontiers which indiscriminately cut across Eweland. We deplore the partition of our country as this constitutes a very serious barrier to our social, economic, educational and political progress as a people and we therefore do hereby resolve: (a) That all the international frontiers cutting across be removed and all Eweland brought under a single administration; (b) that the whole of Eweland become a trust territory. (c) That Britain be invited to become the administering authority in Eweland. (d) That representatives of the Ewe people take part in the making of the trusteeship agreement. (e) That a new constitution be drawn up for the whole of Eweland taking due account of our Native Authorities and our political aspirations . We are convinced that this resolution expresses the wishes of all thoughtful Ewes in both the British and French spheres of Eweland. We wish that this resolution be published in as many newspapers as possible and also brought to the notice of: (i) The British Government, (ii) The French Government, and the United Nations.\\" All-Ewe Conference In June 1946, the All-Ewe Conference (AEC) was founded and its immediate mandate was to send petitions to the British government, the French government, and the United Nations. Chapman had then been elected the first Secretary-General of the All-Ewe Conference (AEC). He sent a copy of the resolution to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and added an accompanying note of him explaining that even though the Ewe Chiefs had not signed the resolution, they had made a similar request to Colonel Oliver Stanley when he visited the Gold Coast, moreover, the 26 people who signed the resolution were representatives of the Ewe people as a whole. He further explained that it was not their (AEC) intention to disrespect the British Government in any way however, the matter was urgent. Chapman held the Secretary-General position for about a year. In 1946 he was invited by the United Nations (UN) to work as an area specialist in the Department of Trusteeship and Information from Non-Self Governing Territories. According to the letter from the UN, he had been invited because the UN wanted somebody from Africa and they were told he met the qualifications they were looking for; \\"somebody who had knowledge of the affairs of issues of non-self governing territories.\\" After he had received the invitation, he asked for a study leave without pay for five years from the Achimota College Council. His request turned down as the council was unable to recommend his request to the government. As he recalled; \\"They gave me two options: either I stay, or I persist on going without a study leave and also losing many years' pension. In the end I opted to forego the pension and the study leave; for, to me, working at the UN will give me opportunity to advance the issues which, as AEC Secretary-General, preoccupied me.\\" First UN appointment In November 1946 Chapman Nyaho went to the UN in New York with his wife, and children (then two children). Chapman's task at the United Nations was to help analyse reports on educational, social and economic conditions in non-self governing territories. He was also responsible for summarising, sifting and analysing information sent to the UN by metropolitan powers about their colonies. While working with UN, Chapman enrolled at the New York University and the Columbia University for evening courses in international law, European history and international organizations. He and his family were the first to move into the residential area specifically built for the UN staff in Long Island, New York. There, Chapman was made the treasurer of an association that was formed by the staff. The association founded the United Nations International School in 1947 and established playgrounds for the children. It also organised international food and dance festivals in an attempt to raise money for the school. Chapman was a management board member of the school from 1950 to 1954. Government and diplomatic duties=Secretary to the Cabinet In 1951, the Gold Coast had made study political progress. The then government made efforts to employ more Africans in the Civil Service in anticipation of political independence. The Convention People's Party (CPP) government which began to share the colony's administration with the colonial government from 1951 began seeking qualified Gold Coast natives who were living abroad to return to the colony and contribute to the national reconstruction. Chapman was offered in succession the positions of Registrar, Vice-Principal and Acting Principal of the newly opened Kumasi College of Technology, Principal Secretary to the Ministry of Education and finally the post of the Secretary to the Cabinet between the period of 1952 and 1953. In 1952 changes were made in the Gold Coast constitution resulting in the appointment of a Prime Minister and also the need for a secretary to the cabinet. Until the time of his appointment, the post had been a combined with the job of the secretary to the Governor and this post was held by Gordon Hadow. In June 1954 Chapman returned to the Gold Coast and took up appointment as Secretary to the then Prime Minister of the Gold Coast, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. The salary was less than half of what he was receiving at the UN yet he accepted the post. As the Secretary to the then Prime Minister, he was responsible for advising the Prime Minister on policy questions, overseeing government business for the Legislative Assembly and making sure Cabinet decisions were carried out. According to him: \\"When I took over as secretary to the Cabinet, the Governor stressed two things; first, that I must ensure that the Prime Minister does not disgrace himself; second that the Ministers do not quarrel among themselves. I believed I carried out religiously those two instructions, hence the great harmony in which Cabinet worked in my day.\\" As an advocate of Ewe unification and the participation of Ewe people in the Gold Coast and Togoland under British Trusteeship, he accompanied the (Regional) administrative Officer of the Volta Region in November 1954 to the Fourth Committee of Trusteeship Council for the discussion of the Togoland and Ewe situation as a member of the British Government delegation. He believed that Ewe unification and Ewe participation in the political advancement of the Gold Coast will aid in the colony's political independence. Ambassadorial appointment Following Ghana's independence in 1957, Chapman gained appointment as Ghana's ambassador to the United States and Ghana's permanent representative at the UN. He was a part of the Ghana delegation to the first Conference of Independent African States held in Accra in April 1958. As an ambassador, he was demanded to implement decisions of the Conference of Independent African States. In executing this responsibility, he led the independent Africa states mission to tour South America and the Caribbean to put present the case of Algeria. In 1959, he became the first vice-chairman of the Governing Council of the UN Special Fund. Headmaster of Achimota College and later life=Headmaster of Achimota Following the exit of the last expatriate Headmaster of Achimota College, the then government insisted on instating a Ghanaian headmaster to steer the affairs of the school. Chapman was then appointed to assume this position in 1958. While at Achimota College, he renovated structures that had not seen repairs in years he also founded a building to help improve the condition of students as far as infrastructure was concerned. He also helped in making some courses being taught then at the school locally relevant. As headmaster of the school, he served on the Interim National Council on Higher Education and Research. He was also served as the vice-chairman of the International Commission on Higher Education in Ghana between 1961 and 1962. The commission's membership was drawn broadly from Africa, Europe and the USA. Notable members of the Commission included; N. S. Torocheshnikov a scientist from the Soviet Union, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, a social anthropologist and then professor of Anthropology at the University of Oxford, H. M. Bond, an African -American educationist; and Davidson Nicol, then principal of Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone. The commission was known for its recommendation of the then University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana) and the Kumasi College of Technology (now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology) being made independent universities with each having its university Council as its governing body. The commission also recommended that a third Ghanaian university be built at Cape Coast in acknowledgement of its long and distinguished educational tradition, and also recommended the establishment of an Institute of African Studies to help students understand the African civilisation, its history and its ideas. According to Chapman, he faced a number of challenges as headmaster of Achimota College. He was first concerned with what he termed an \\"unnecessary interference\\" of the government in the affairs of the school. He was also concerned about the poor feeding of students, and the government's intentions of building the School of Administration on the school's playing field. Second UN appointment and later life Chapman was appointed Chief of Operations by the UN General- Secretary during the period of the Congo Crisis however, the government of Ghana refused to endorse his nomination. According to him, \\"Nkrumah rejected my nomination because he knew I had an abiding belief in being loyal to my employers.\\" He was therefore appointed Director of UN Division of Narcotic Drugs by the UN Secretary-General in 1963. He was stationed in Geneva. As Director, he consulted with the national narcotics control body of various countries. He helped to organise and participated in narcotics control missions under the United Nations Technical Assistance in the field of narcotic drugs. After the 1966 coup d'et√¢t, Chapman returned to Ghana and was appointed a member of the Political Committee of the National Liberation Council. He was later appointed chairman of the Arts Council of Ghana and also chairman of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Council. He was appointed Director Pioneer Tobacco Company in 1967, he held this position until 1970 when he retired on the grounds of ill-health. Between 1969 and 1970, he was a Danforth visiting lecturer for the Association of American Colleges. In his retirement, he spent most of his time consulting for PTC, doing farming in a small scale and, also going for meetings of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences of which he was a fellow. Personal life, death and tributes=Personal life Chapman married Jane Efua Abam Chapman Nyaho (n√©e Quashie), daughter of Nana Nyarko VII, Nifahene of the Peki State in 1941, together they had five daughters and two sons. His hobbies were music, walking, gardening and reading. On his 90th birthday K. B. Asante, the former Ghanaian diplomat and one of his former students at Achimota College, eulogised him in these words as he reflected on his days at Achimota College: > \\"The masters and mistresses in those days entertained students to lunches > and teas now and again. They did not give you extra coaching for a fee. > Rather they opened your mind with broad discussion and fed you as well: > Daniel Chapman would say: \\"Eat, you won't get this in the dining hall. It is > butter, not margarine.\\" He told us stories about Oxford and whetted our > appetite for learning. He constantly encouraged you and gave the impression > that he was exploring the path of knowledge with you. He was genuinely > delighted when you did well. As he often put it, \\"if you do not do better > than me then I have failed.\\"\\" Death, burial and tribute He died on Friday 13 July 2001 at the age of ninety-two (92). He was scheduled to be buried on Saturday 11 August 2001 in his hometown; Keta. On Friday 10 August 2001, a state burial was held in his honour at the forecourt of the State House in Accra. He was laid to rest with Military honours at the Osu Cemetery. Present at the ceremony was the then president of Ghana, John Agyekum Kufuor, his vice, Aliu Mahama, former president, Jerry John Rawlings and his wife Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings. The burial ceremony was also attended by other public officials; Ministers of State, members of the Council of State and the Diplomatic Corps, Chiefs, Service Commands and old students of Achimota School. In his tribute which was read by Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, the then Minister of Presidential Affairs, the then president, John Agyekum Kufuor described Chapman as, \\"distinguished statesman who deserved national honours while he was alive.\\" Honours * In 1960, Chapman was a recipient of the Companion of British Empire (CBE) award. * The Agricultural College, Greensbore North Carolina U.S.A bestowed upon him an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree. *In 2015, he was honoured posthumously by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration for helping shape Ghana's foreign policy as Ghana's permanent representative to the UN and Ghana's ambassador to the United States of America. His name is engraved on three conference room halls in the office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration. Publications While working as an Ewe language examiner for the Cambridge University School Certificate Examination, he observed a considerable lack of understanding of the Ewe customs among his candidates. This resulted in a publication he started together with F. K. Potakey, also a teacher at Achimota, called Ewe Studies. Together, they worked on another book called Anlo Constitution which covered Ewe customs and institutions. He continued with a series of research on the history and geography of the Ewe people and this resulted in two publications by the names: *Our Homeland ( Book 1 - A Regional Geography of South East Gold Coast, (1945); *The Human Geography of Eweland (1945).

He obtained imprecise results and identified the source of the error to the instruments, the study of which was his doctoral thesis of 1876. After strained relations with Le Verrier he sought the creation of an observatory in Lyon and briefly worked at the Faculty of Science in Lyon as a professor of astronomy. He made a visit to Utah in 1878 to observe a transit of Mercury but snow prevented the study. He however visited several American observatories.

He is a two-time world kickboxing champion and is best known for being the only person to ever defend his championship title after open-heart surgery. He is an 8th-degree Black Belt and has owned and operated five Martial Arts schools. He is a veteran of WWE and WCW and also started his own professional wrestling promotion, Central Wrestling Organization, in Denver, Colorado.  Early Life  Dan Magnus was born in New York, New York, the son of Everett and Elizabeth Magnus. He is the oldest of 3 children: Daniel, Connie and Lee. He attended George Washington High School in New York, New York and graduated from the Class of 1974. As a teenager, Magnus was a competitive roller skater from 1973 to 1976. He won third-place for Junior Men Figures at the 1974 National Roller Skating Championships.  Early Career  After finishing his studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Police Science, Magnus became a New York City police officer. It was during this time that Magnus started training full-contact fighting with future world karate champion Jeff Smith. This training helped him as he moved onto being a contract fugitive recovery specialist. Magnus concurrently competed, owned his own martial arts schools and also trained police officers. During his time in fugitive recovery and private bounty hunting, he had been shot and stabbed many times while on duty. In 1983, he was hit by a car during a chase which caused him to fall over a 4-foot retaining wall, breaking his ribs, which pierced his heart, and subsequently severing his aortic valve.  Kickboxing And Coming Back From Heart Surgery  Magnus began his martial arts training in 1969, learning from big names in the martial arts field such as Peter Urban, Jeff Smith, Rodney Batiste and Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace. He won 35 of his 45 full-contact fights and became the United States light-middleweight full-contact karate champion in 1982 and the #3 contender in the world. Shortly after winning the championship title in 1982, Magnus was chasing a fugitive and was hit by a car which sent him tumbling over a 4-foot retaining wall. In April 1983, Magnus was preparing for a world title bout in Denver against Tom Dalton when doctors detected a heart murmur an hour before the match. The doctors did not allow him to fight, even after he protested and choked the doctor. Despite threatening everyone, there was no title bout and the world championship title was given to someone else. The doctors discovered that he was bleeding internally. The accident from the previous year had broken his ribs which punctured his heart and tore his aortic valve. After undergoing surgery, about a quarter of his heart was now made of metal. In 1984, the Professional Karate Association vacated his US championship title because of a policy where if a fighter is injured and cannot defend their title within that year, they are stripped of their title. At the same time, his wife filed for divorce, he lost his house, lost his dog and his finances were dwindling. Seven different cardiologists had also told him that he would never fight again. He set out to prove them wrong and trained to regain his strength back, walking out of the hospital 10 days later. He fought the following year--one year to the day of the surgery--and defeated Tom Dalton in Atlantic City and gained back his title in a unanimous judges' decision. After seeing how he got back into shape, two of the doctors started to take martial arts lessons from him. As of 2020, Magnus is still the only person on the planet to come back to competition from open heart surgery and win a fight.  Life After Kickboxing  10 years after his first heart surgery, the valve ripped again in June 1994. In the original procedure, the doctors were hoping to avoid replacing the heart valve so they stitched it back together but now there was irreparable damage so it was replace with a mechanical valve. After being given a 50/50 chance of survival, Dan Magnus walked out of the hospital 4 days later. In 1997, Magnus, along with Ryan Katz, co-founded Central Wrestling Organization (CWO) in Colorado. To coincide, Magnus opened Slam City Wrestling School, the first pro-wrestling training school in Colorado. Magnus wasn't looking for professional wrestlers for the wrestling school. He just wanted people who wanted to \\"try out their dreams.\\" Beyond expectation, Slam City's popularity exploded. Since the early 2010s, Magnus has periodically offered self-defense trainings around the country. Originally named \\"R.E.A.C.T. Before You A.C.T.,\\" he renamed the personal protection seminars \\"Victim No More.\\" He also wrote a book in 2014 on self defense, The M.A.G.N.U.S. Method: R.E.A.C.T. B 4 U A.C.T. He also contributed to a book for students heading off to college with a bonus chapter: \\"How to Keep Your Teen Safe on Campus.\\" In 2018, Magnus underwent another heart surgery but, like the previous two times, bounced back after doctors had given him dim diagnoses. In 2019, Magnus was nominated for a Los Angeles Broadway World Award for Best Choreography for \\"Afterglow: 80s Musical Experience,\\" a musical play based on the real-life stories of the original Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). He also acted in the role of \\"Referee\\" in the show.  Trainees  Dan Magnus has trained many martial artists over the years. *Nick Angell (ice hockey player) *Chuck Billte *Danny Boccagno (martial artist) *Sifu Chee (martial artist) *Deacon (wrestler) *John Fabbricatore *Sammy Franco (martial artist) *Jason David Frank (White Dragon, Green Power Ranger) *Ryan Katz (GQ Money) *Mary Kennedy (actress) *John Kyle (martial artist) *Steve Magill (martial artist) *Kayla Meltzer (Juvi Hall, Britney Astor) (wrestler) *Tracee Meltzer (Roxy Astor) (wrestler) *Steve Scarborough (Steve Platinum) (wrestler) *Michael Tull (martial artist) *Amy Wade (actress, filmmaker)  Personal life  After two marriages and divorces, Magnus has partnered with Tracee Meltzer since 2013.

Its title refers to Golestan (\\"Rose Garden\\"), a collection of poems and stories by 13th-century Persian poet and writer Sa'di. The piece lasts about 30 minutes in performance.Roberge, p. 264  Background and composition  Persian poetry served as a source of inspiration for Sorabji throughout his life.Roberge, pp. 25, 246 Although not programmatic,Anon. (n.d.). \\"KSS63 GulistƒÅn\\". The Sorabji Archive. Retrieved 7 June 2020. GulistƒÅn is inspired by Sa'di's (1210 ‚Äì c. 1291) book Golestan, parts of which Sorabji had set to music in his Trois po√®mes du \\"GulistƒÅn\\" de Sa ødƒ´ (1926, rev. 1930) for piano and baritone.Roberge, p. 265 Besides the reference to Sa'di's work, the preface in the manuscript also contains a quotation from South Wind, a 1917 novel by Norman Douglas. Sorabji began working on GulistƒÅn before 6 January 1940 and completed it on 13 August 1940.Roberge, p. 443 Though originally dedicated to Frank Holliday, following the rupture of his friendship with Sorabji in 1979, the dedication was transferred to Sorabji's friend, the British poet, dramatist and translator Harold Morland, who, upon hearing the piece that same year, wrote: \\"This is no garden. But a spirit's Paradise.\\"Roberge, pp. 257, 264  Music  GulistƒÅn is written in Sorabji's \\"tropical nocturne\\" genre, which is often described as evoking a hothouse, rainforest or tropical heat.Roberge, pp. 22, 90 The opening of the piece introduces a sinuous, chromatic melody that reoccurs in various guises. Much of the piece uses series of diatonic chords (usually broken and heard in the lower registers), with the main ones having F, F-sharp, A or C as the root note, while the middle voices present chant-like melodies and the upper ones use chromatic figurations.Habermann, p. 56 Despite the active, highly intricate ornamental writing, the piece is to be played at a subdued volume throughout. About two- thirds of the way in, the ornamental writing is interrupted by a slow passage in three-part counterpoint, following which the earlier writing returns. The piece concludes with a reminiscence of the opening that ends on a low A.Roberge, p. 266  Assessment  GulistƒÅn occupies a very prestigious position among Sorabji's works. Pianist and composer Jonathan Powell, discussing Sorabji's nocturnes, calls it \\"arguably his most successful essay in the genre\\". Pianist Michael Habermann describes it as a \\"superb, luscious piece\\", and musicologist Simon John Abrahams opines that it stands out among Sorabji's works \\"due to the remarkable integration of the texture and figuration, as well as the richness of the harmony.\\"Abrahams, p. 231 Musicologist Marc-Andr√© Roberge considers it \\"the most compelling work in Sorabji's entire production for the piano\\" and writes that \\"[its] gorgeousness is probably unmatched in the entire repertoire\\".

Specializing in disaster relief, from 2008 to 2015 she served as UN Assistant Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, simultaneously heading the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. In May 2017, she was elected President of the Swedish Red Cross. Biography Born on 30 March 1950, Margareta Wahlstr√∂m was brought up in Boden in north-eastern Sweden. The first in her family to go to university, she studied diplomacy, economic history and social anthropology, as well as French and Spanish, at Stockholm University. Wahlstr√∂m's first job after graduating was in South America where she worked on a development project. She was then invited to go to Vietnam to take part in an aid initiative involving a paper mill. It provided opportunities for her to meet many inhabitants interested in rebuilding their country. The experience inspired her to devote her life to assisting people struck by major disasters. After Vietman, she moved to neighbouring Cambodia where she joined the refugee organization UNHCR where she was charged with investigating security. After a short assignment in Thailand she returned to Stockholm where she embarked on a doctoral thesis on rural development. Unable to spend all her time in the university library, she soon took up a new post with the Swedish Red Cross as an administrator in South Africa during the final years of apartheid. In 1989, this led to a position with the International Red Cross in Geneva as Desk Officer for Southern Africa with assignments in Angola and Cambodia. She was then promoted to Deputy Director of Operations (1991) and finally to Under Secretary-General (1995‚Äì2000). These positions involved cooperation with national Red Cross bodies in disaster-ravaged countries including the Congo, Somalia, Iraq and the emerging countries of the former Yugoslavia. Once again preferring to work in the field rather than in a desk job, Wahlstr√∂m moved to Afghanistan on a UN assignment aimed at reconstructing the country as part of its disaster recovery agenda. In 2009, she was appointed Special Representative of the United Nations‚Äô Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, and simultaneously Head of the United Nations‚Äô Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). In 2015, under her leadership the UN adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In 2017, now aged 67, Wahlstr√∂m accepted an invitation from the Swedish Red Cross to become their new leader. She accepted, taking up her new appointment on 7 May 2017.

Naming This species was originally described in 1859 by the mycologists Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome in the British \\"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\\". The original collection was done on the Coed Coch estate in Denbighshire, Wales, which then belonged to the Wynne family. The entry for the new species explicitly mentions Mrs. Wynne, and so it is clear that the mushroom was named for her and not her husband. A Latinized species name takes the genitive ending -i (or -ii) if it is dedicated to a man and it takes -ae (or -iae) if it is for a woman. Therefore the spelling wynneae is correct here, even though the spelling in the original description of the species was wynnei. In English this fungus has the common name \\"Pearly Parachute\\". Description The same set of references applies to this section throughout. The hygrophanous cap is hemispherical and white to greyish or ochre when young. Later it expands to become flat and may turn grey or also take on violet tints. The diameter is from about 1 cm to 5 cm. The whitish thick and distant gills are almost free to emarginate. There is no ring or other veil remnant. The tough stem is up to about 7 cm long and up to 0.5 cm in diameter. Initially it is whitish and it becomes red brown from the base. The taste is mild and the smell is pleasant initially (of hay, melilot or bitter almonds) but after a moment it becomes unpleasant (of acid, or a drying facecloth). The spore powder is white and the spores are ellipsoid, sometimes elongated (with an aspect ratio up to about 2) and are around 6-8 ¬µm by 3.5-4.5 ¬µm. There are cheilocystidia which are club-shaped to spindle-shaped with lobes at one end. Distribution, habitat, ecology and human impact This saprobic mushroom grows in clusters on humus and litter in beech woods or other broad-leaved woods. The conspicuous white mycelium can bind leaf litter together in sheets. This mushroom is widespread from August to January in Europe, and has been reported from Algeria, Morocco, and Texas, but not from other regions.

Postal voting reduces staff requirements at polling centers during an election. All-mail elections can save money, while a mix of voting options can cost more. In some states, ballots may be sent by the Postal Service without prepayment of postage. Vote by mail is available in both Democratic and Republican states. Research shows that the availability of postal voting increases voter turnout. It has been argued that postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting, though there are relatively few known instances of such fraud, with one database finding 491 cases of absentee ballot fraud from 2000 to 2012, a period in which billions of votes were cast. Election offices rejected 67,000 ballots in the 2018 election and 92,000 in the 2016 election because mismatched signatures led officials to believe postal ballots had been forged. If they had not been forged, voters were disenfranchised. Processing large numbers of ballots and signature verifications accurately has numerous challenges other than fraud. As of July 2020, five states‚ÄîColorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington‚Äîhold elections almost entirely by mail. Postal voting is an option in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Other states allow postal voting only in certain circumstances, though the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has prompted further discussion about relaxing some of those restrictions. In the run up to the 2020 United States presidential election, repeatedly asserting that mail-in voting will result in widespread fraud, President Donald Trump has indicated that he will block necessary funding for the postal service that ensures such votes are processed securely and on time. In September 2020, the Homeland Security Department issued an intelligence bulletin asserting \\"Russia is likely to continue amplifying criticisms of vote-by-mail and shifting voting processes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to undermine public trust in the electoral process.\\"  Process  A vote-by-mail ballot is returned to a ballot drop box. Absentee ballots were first used for the military during the American Civil War. For many years after, postal votes were for people who could not go to the polling place on election day. Now some states let them be used for convenience, but state laws still call them absentee ballots. Some states let voters with permanent disabilities apply for permanent absentee voter status, and some other states let all citizens apply for permanent status, so they will automatically receive an absentee ballot for each election. Otherwise a voter must apply for an absentee ballot before each election. Ballots or applications for postal ballots are sent out before the election date, by a margin that depends on state law. In some states, a voter's pamphlet is also distributed. The election office prints a unique barcode on the return envelope provided for each ballot, so processing of each envelope can be tracked, sometimes publicly, and corresponding signature files can be loaded quickly to check the voter's signature on the envelope when it returns. Voters who lose the return envelope can still vote by obtaining another envelope from election officials, or in some jurisdictions by using a plain envelope. To vote by mail, an individual marks the ballot for their choice of the candidates (or writes in their name), places it in the provided mailing envelope, seals it and signs and dates the back of the mailing envelope. Some jurisdictions use one envelope or privacy sleeve inside an outer envelope, for privacy. The envelope containing the ballot is then either mailed, or dropped off at a local ballot collection center. The deadline is determined by state law. In some jurisdictions, postmarks are not counted, and ballots must be received by a certain time on election day. In other jurisdictions, a ballot must have a postmark on or before the day of the election and be received prior to the date of certification. Many vote-by-mail jurisdictions enlist the help of volunteers to take ballots in walk-up drop off booths or drive-up quick drop locations. The Help America Vote Act requires some polling options, often at central election headquarters, with voting machines designed for disabled people. It is sometimes inaccurately claimed that absentee ballots are not counted unless the race is close; in fact, all valid absentee ballots are counted even if they will not affect the outcome of an election. In the 2016 US Presidential election, approximately 33 million ballots were cast by postal vote, about a quarter of all ballots cast. Some jurisdictions used only vote-by-mail and others absentee votes. In April 2020, during lockdowns for the coronavirus pandemic, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 58% of American voters would favor nationwide election reform to allow everyone to vote by mail, and another 9% (total 67%) favor allowing it this year because of COVID-19. Pew Research found at the same time that 49% of Republicans supported this measure and 87% of Democrats did. One peer-reviewed study found the in-person voting in Wisconsin in April 2020 did not produce a detectable surge in cases, and rated it as a low-risk activity. Voting from abroad (UOCAVA) In 2018, 350,000 ballots came through procedures of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), from military and merchant marine voters stationed inside or outside the United States, and other citizens living outside the United States. In 1986 Congress enacted UOCAVA, which requires that the states and territories allow United States citizens residing outside the United States, as well as members of the United States Uniformed Services and merchant marine, and their family members, inside or outside the United States, to register at their last residence in the US, and vote absentee in elections for federal offices. Most states and territories also let these citizens vote in state and local elections, and most states let citizens who have never lived in the US vote at their parents' last address. Though many states had pre-existing statutes in place, UOCAVA made it mandatory and nationally uniform. Voters eligible for UOCAVA who do not receive an absentee ballot from their state in time to vote, may use the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot. The voter's signature goes on an information sheet enclosed with this ballot, not on the envelope. It requires following state requirements for witnesses, but not for notaries. Almost half the states require ballots to be returned by mail. Other states allow mail along with some combination of fax, or email; four states allow a web portal. West Virginia experimented with use of smart phones, but this is no longer available.  In states  An Oregon mail-in ballot for a special election in May 2005 The National Conference of State Legislatures has many tables showing rules about postal voting in every state. In 1996, astronaut John Blaha was not able to vote in the November 1996 election, because his mission on Mir began before ballots were finalized, and lasted beyond Election Day. As a result, in 1997, Texas amended its election statutes to permit voting from outer space.(October 21, 2004) Democracy in Orbit: Chiao to Vote in Space NASA The process extends traditional postal voting: the ballot is postal-mailed to a designated mailbox maintained by NASA, which sends it by encrypted electronic mail to the astronaut. After the astronaut completes the ballot, it is sent to the applicable Texas county clerk, who transcribes it to a paper ballot. The clerk is the only individual other than the voter who knows the contents of the submitted ballot. The first person to vote from space was astronaut David Wolf, who in 1997 voted in a local Texas election under the new law. In 1998, voters in Oregon passed an initiative requiring that all elections be conducted by mail. Voters may also drop their ballots off at a county designated official drop site. Oregon has since reduced the cost of elections, and the time available to tally votes has increased. Oregon requires receipt of votes by 8:00pm local time on election day. County elections offices collect from post offices at their closing time on election day and from drop boxes at 8:00pm election day. Any valid ballot received by 8:00pm local time on election day by any county is required to be counted, unless the cumulative votes of any valid ballots transferred to the relevant county elections office after the closing of the polls cannot change the outcome of the election for any given seat. Voter turnout is among the highest in Oregon. In 2011, the Washington legislature passed a law requiring all counties to conduct vote-by-mail elections. Local governments in Washington had the option to do so since 1987, and statewide elections had permitted it since 1993. By 2009, 38 of the state's 39 counties (all except Pierce County) had conducted all elections by mail. Pierce County joined the rest of the state in all-mail balloting by 2014. In Washington, ballots must be postmarked by election day, which helps to ensure all voters' votes are counted; ballot counting takes several days after election day to receive and process ballots. Beginning in 2018 postage is prepaid so voters do not have to use a stamp. In 2013, Colorado began holding all elections by mail. A Pantheon Analytics study of the 2014 election showed a significant uptick in voter participation from what would have normally been \\"low propensity\\" voters. A PEW Charitable Trust study of the same election showed significant cost savings. Total votes and mailed votes, by state US 2016 In 2014, Utah started allowing each county to make their own decision regarding whether to go to all mailed-out ballots. In the 2016 general election, 21 of 29 counties did so. That rose to 27 of 29 counties in 2018, covering over 98% of their electorate, with all counties doing so in 2020. A Pantheon Analytics study of Utah's 2016 general election showed a 5‚Äì7% point higher turnout in the counties using vote by mail than those with traditional polling places, with even higher differences (~10% points) among younger voters. In 2016, California passed SB 450, which authorizes a roll-out of vote by mail across the state, at county discretion. The state publishes postal voting rates, rising from 3% in 1962 to 72% in 2020. For the 2018 elections, 14 counties were authorized to vote by mail and five ultimately did so: Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, and San Mateo. In each of those five counties, voter turnout was higher than the average turnout for the state. For 2020, all counties will be authorized to do so, and as of April 8, 2020 the following ten additional counties have opted in: Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles, Mariposa, Orange, Santa Clara, and Tuolumne. As of 2020, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington State conduct their elections entirely by mail; in many other states there are counties or certain small elections where everyone votes by mail. California will mail every voter a ballot before the November 2020 election; California voters will also keep the option to vote in-person. Florida is considering postal voting for the November 2020 election. In 2020 four states joined the majority of states which already allowed \\"no excuse\\" voting by mail (meaning that the voter does not need to provide a reason for requesting a mail-in ballot): Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Other states have relaxed restrictions on mail in ballots for a total of 46 states to allow voting by mail due to COVID-19.https://trustthevote.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/05/27May20_BipartisanTruthAboutByMailVoting_v3.pdf Kansas conducted its Democratic primary in May 2020 entirely by mail. Hawaii used full vote by mail for all elections beginning with its primary in May 2020. New Jersey will also conduct a primarily vote by mail election for the upcoming primary in July 2020 albeit a limited number of polling stations will be open for those who would vote provisionally as well as voters with disabilities. The Trump campaign sued Pennsylvania to require voters to mail their ballot in a secrecy envelope or else to personally deliver it to an official county election office. Other jurisdictions are now starting to experiment with vote by mail, or run pilot programs. 31 of 53 counties in North Dakota now vote by mail, as do over 1000 precincts in Minnesota (those with fewer than 400 registered voters). In 2018, pilot programs in Anchorage, Alaska exceeded previous turnout records and Garden County, Nebraska saw higher turnout versus the state average. Rockville, Maryland piloted vote-by- mail in 2019. In 2018, Connecticut's Governor issued Executive Order 64, directing a study of a possible move to vote by mail. Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak (D) signed legislation authorizing mail-in-voting for every registered voter in the state on August 3. Donald Trump threatened to sue. Trump endorsed mail-in-voting in Republican-controlled Florida.  Turnout Insofar as postal voting makes the act of voting easier, it may facilitate a campaign's \\"get out the vote\\" efforts. Campaigns can also target potential voters more efficiently by skipping those whose ballots have already been processed by the elections office. On the other hand, face-to-face canvassing has been found to be less effective with postal voting. In 2016, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report outlining turnout improvements seen in vote by mail elections. Researchers in 2020 confirm that studies have shown increased turnout \\"mainly for those who already vote.\\" In Colorado they found overall turnout rose 9 percentage points, while it rose 16 percentage points among young people, 13 among African-Americans, 11 among Asian- Americans, 10 among Latinos, blue-collar workers, those without a high school diploma, and those with less than $10,000 of wealth.  Reliability of postal ballots =Rejection statistics In 2016, a presidential election year, a total of 318,728 ballots (1% of those submitted) were rejected. For the states that reported a reason, some of the reasons were: * 27.5% - Non-matching signature * 23.1% - Ballot missed deadline * 20.0% - No signature * 3.0% - No witness signature * 1.5% - Voter deceased * 1.3% - Voted in person * 1.1% - First-time voter without proper identification By August 2020, after the next presidental primary season but before the general election, more than 550,000 had already been rejected. Past problems Postal ballots have been the source of \\"most significant vote-counting disputes in recent decades\\" according to Edward Foley, director of the Election Law program at Ohio State University. *Similar summary by Mark Braden, former chief counsel for the Republican National Committee, \\"The shortcomings of various systems across the country in recount situations, the vast majority of the time, involve mail voting.\\" at 22 minutes in webinar at the National Conference of State Legislatures Among the thousands of elections from 2000 to 2012, there were 491 known cases of absentee ballot fraud, and the Heritage Foundation lists additional cases since 2012. From 2003 to 2018, at least 15 local election results were thrown out in tight elections based in part on absentee voting fraud. Richard Hasen, a professor at UC Irvine School of Law said \\"problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote-by-mail.\\" Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University does not have statistics on postal ballot fraud, but said \\"I do collect anecdotal reports... misconduct in the mail voting process is meaningfully more prevalent than misconduct in the process of voting in person... Misconduct still amounts to only a tiny fraction of the ballots cast by mail.\\" Lonna Atkeson, an expert in election administration, said about mail-in voting fraud, \\"It's really hard to find... The fact is, we really don't know how much fraud there is... There aren't millions of fraudulent votes, but there are some.\\" In 2018, a report from the US Senate Intelligence Committee of Russian meddling in the 2016 election pointed out that auditable paper ballots, by definition part of all vote by mail elections, were potentially safer than paperless voting systems, which are still used in a few states. However only about half the states actually use paper ballots to conduct election audits. Specific types of problems include: *Voter's request for postal ballot, in states that require one, is lost or not received or processed in time, so voter must vote in person or not vote (for example over 9,000 properly requested ballots were not sent in Wisconsin in 2020) *Voter's request is altered or forged *In states that mail ballots to registered voters without request, some voters have died or moved, and any ballots not returned by the post office can get into the wrong hands *Election office sends voters the wrong instructions or wrong ballot, when offices on the ballot differ by party or district. *Voter does not receive mailed ballot, because it does not arrive at the address in time, or someone else takes it *Voter misplaces ballot, so must vote with provisional ballot, and someone else may find and vote the original postal ballot, leading to rejection of the provisional ballot. *Voter is pressured to vote a certain way by family, caregiver, or other, or provide the blank ballot to someone *Voters may be paid to vote a certain way *Someone collects many ballots and does not deliver the ones from neighborhoods likely to vote against the collector's candidates *Someone collects many ballots, opens envelopes, and marks votes; if voter has already voted, fraudster can mark extra votes on same contests, to invalidate ballot *Election office receives the ballot late (114,000 ballots in 2018); in a Philadelphia experiment, most ballots were misplaced by the postal service, and even after they were found, 21% took more than 4 days to arrive and 3% took more than a week *Voter's signature on envelope is missing (55,000 in 2018) or does not match signature on file (67,000), so either there is widespread fraud being prevented by signature reviews, or if these submissions were not fraudulent, then valid ballots are being rejected *Forged signature on envelope is accepted as close enough to signature on file, so invalid ballots are accepted *Signature rejection rates vary by race, county and state, ranging from none to 20% rejected *Staff who open envelopes falsify or ignore ballots *Compilation of votes omits postal ballots These problems with postal ballots can be categorized as (A) procedural issues, which may not have solutions; (B) collection of ballots by dishonest collectors, which is partly controlled in many states by limits on the number of ballots that one person can deliver, though collectors can still mail in the ballots they collect, and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals disallowed Arizona's limits based on discriminatory intent; (C) signature verification, which has inherent errors and may have bias, and (D) insider issues, which are partly addressed by enough staffing, quality control, and openness to observation by the public or candidates. Some problems have inherently limited scope, such as family pressure and bribes, while others can affect several percent of the vote, such as signature verification. Security printing Some states say they print postal ballots on special paper to prevent forgeries. Special papers, microprinting, magnetic ink and other measures are common to protect currency, bank checks and stamps. Election officials do not say they review ballots based on these methods, though the Labor Department reviews paper when considering if union election ballots are forged. States print bar codes on return envelopes to identify the voter (coding a serial number for each envelope mailed),. so a forger would need to know the coding system in order to forge bar codes. California lets voters write votes \\"in a letter or note\\" on any paper, and enclose as many such notes in a vote by mail envelope as will fit, with a signature for each on the outside. Only one bar code on the envelope is needed. Signature verification process Sorting vote by mail envelopes, San Jose, Santa Clara County, California, 2018 Most States check signatures to attempt to prevent forged paper ballots. Signature mismatches were the most common reason for rejecting postal ballots in 2016 and the second most common, after late arrival, in 2018. While many states accept in-person votes without needing identification, most require some verification on postal ballots. Six states and DC simply require a signature on the ballot envelope, without verifying the signature, 44 states require the signature to match one on file, and some of these states require witnesses or notaries. The first step after receiving mailed ballots is to compare the voter's signature on the outside of the envelope with one or more signatures on file in the election office. Smaller jurisdictions have temporary staff compare signatures. Larger jurisdictions use computers to scan envelopes, quickly decide if the signature matches well enough, and set aside non-matches in a separate bin. Temporary staff then double-check the rejections, and in some places check the accepted envelopes too. Error rates of computerized signature reviews are not published. The best academic researchers have 10-14% error rates. Algorithms: > look for a certain number of points of similarity between the compared > signatures ... a wide range of algorithms and standards, each particular to > that machine's manufacturer, are used to verify signatures. In addition, > counties have discretion in managing the settings and implementing > manufacturers' guidelines ... there are no statewide standards for automatic > signature verification ... most counties do not have a publicly available, > written explanation of the signature verification criteria and processes > they use. Handwriting experts say \\"it is extremely difficult for anyone to be able to figure out if a signature or other very limited writing sample has been forged,\\" In manual signature reviews, \\"election officials with little or no training in verifying a person's signature are tasked with doing just that ... it's unlikely that only one or two samples will show the spectrum of a person's normal variations....\\" Colorado's guide for manual verification is recommended by the federal government. Colorado accepts any signature that matches with respect to cursive v. printed, flowing v. slow and deliberate, overall spacing, size, proportions, slanted v. straight, spelling and punctuation. When signatures do not match on these items, staff still accept them if staff can think of a reasonable explanation for differences. In a California study, most counties, when they manually reviewed ballot signatures, had \\"a basic presumption in favor of counting each ballot.\\" California extended this standard in 2020 regulations, \\"begin with the basic presumption that the signature on the petition or ballot envelope is the voter's signature... only be rejected if two different elections officials unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the signature differs in multiple, significant, and obvious respects from all signatures in the voter's registration record.\\" Texas officials must use their \\"best judgment\\" without training. Published examples show very different signatures coming from the same person. In 16 states, when election offices reject signatures, they notify the voters so they can mail another signature, which may be just as hard to check, or they can come to the office and vouch for the envelope, usually in less than a week; the other 36 states have no process to cure discrepancies. Notification by US mail results in more cures than email or telephone notice. Rejected envelopes, with ballots still unseen in them, are stored in case of future challenges. Accepted envelopes are opened and separated from the envelopes in a way that no one sees the external name and the ballot choices. The Election Advisory Commission says machines can help, but this step requires the most space of any step, especially when workers have to be 6 feet apart. Unequal signature rejection rates Postal ballots, rejection rates by state, US, November 2016, except Georgia 2018 The highest error rates in signature verification are found with lay people, higher than for computers, which in turn make more errors than experts. Researchers have published error rates for computerized signature verification. They compare different systems on a common database of true and false signatures. The best system falsely rejects 10% of true signatures, while it accepts 10% of forgeries. Another system has error rates on both of 14%, and the third-best has error rates of 17%.These systems handle scanned (\\"offline\\") signatures from multiple people (\\"WI, writer-independent\\"). It is possible to be less stringent and reject fewer true signatures, at the cost of also rejecting fewer forgeries, which means erroneously accepting more forgeries. Vendors of automated signature verification claim accuracy, and do not publish their error rates. Voters with short names are at a disadvantage, since even experts make more mistakes on signatures with fewer \\"turning points and intersections.\\" The National Vote at Home Institute reports that 17 states do not mandate a signature verification process. In the November 2016 general election, rejections ranged from none in Alabama and Puerto Rico, to 6% of ballots returned in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and New York. In 2020 special elections in New Jersey, 10% of postal ballots were rejected, much higher than the 3% rejections in the 2018 general election in New Jersey. The rise was largely attributed to inexperience of many voters using postal ballots for the first time, though some elections have resulted in charges regarding voter fraud. One such race was the Paterson municipal election, where 19% of ballots cast were disqualified. Approximately 800 of the more than 3190 votes disqualified were related to the various voter fraud allegations. Where reasons for rejection were known, in 2018, 114,000 ballots arrived late, 67,000 failed signature verification, 55,000 lacked voter signatures, and 11,000 lacked witness signatures in states that require them. Rejection rates are higher for ballots that claim to come from young or minority voters. In the 2020 primary and 2016 general elections, Florida officials rejected 4% of postal ballots that claimed to come from voters aged 18-25. In the 2018 general election they rejected 5%. In Florida over age 60 or 65, rejections were only a percent in 2020, two thirds of a percent in 2018 and half a percent in 2016. However over age 90, rejection rates were above average, though not as high as under age 25. Rejections were 2% for ballots claiming to come from Florida non-white voters, and 1% from white voters in all three years. In the 2018 Florida election, 4% of postal ballots from military voters stationed inside the United States were rejected. Florida voters are not allowed to cure signature problems if these are discovered after election day. Florida rejection rates in 2016 varied by county, ranging from none to 4%, and up to 5% for ballots that claimed to come from blacks or Hispanics in some counties. Two counties with large universities rejected 9% of 18-21-year-olds: Alachua and Orange, while Pinellas, which also has large universities, rejected 0.2% of this age range. In Georgia's 2018 general election, most counties rejected higher fractions of ballots claiming to come from black or Hispanic voters than from white voters. The highest rejection rates for ballots that claimed to come from black voters were in Polk 17%, Taylor and Clay 16%, Putnam, and Warren 14%, Atkinson and Candler 13%, McIntosh 12%, and Glynn 10%. For Hispanics, Thomas and Putnam counties rejected 20%, Bulloch 14%, Barlow 12%, Glynn 11%, Decatur 10%. The highest rates for whites were Pickens 13%, Coffee and Polk 10%. Researchers also found higher rejection rates for women, which they hypothesized could relate to name changes not updated at the voter registration office, though issues with hyphenated last names can also cause signature rejections. Bias in computer verification depends on the set of signatures used for training the computer, and bias in manual review depends on whether the temporary staff recognize names as non- white. Many voter registrations, especially for younger voters, come from driver's license applications, where the signature was done on an electronic signature pad. People move their hands differently when signing on paper and on electronic pads. Further the pads used have low resolution, so distinctive elements of paper signatures on the ballot envelopes, are blurred or omitted in the electronic signatures used for comparison. Signatures also have more variation, and therefore are harder to verify, when they come from people who rarely use Roman characters, such as some Asian-Americans. Election officials find that a decline in cursive writing leads to young voters more often printing their names in signature blocks; a California official said she \\"cannot compare a printed name to a signature.\\" Recommendations for signature verification The Election Assistance Commission says that computers should be set only to accept nearly perfect signature matches, and humans should doublecheck a sample, but they do not discuss acceptable error rates or sample sizes. The Election Advisory Commission says the first human check of a signature rejected by machines will average 30 seconds, and a sample of decisions to accept should be checked. They recommend all rejections should be checked by bipartisan teams (6 feet apart) who will average 3 minutes for the final decision to reject, which means 6 minutes of staff time, plus supervision time. The Commission also discusses the challenges of moving large numbers of envelopes without mixups from receipt, to machines, and various steps of verification, rejection, and voter notification to cure mismatches, as well as counting and logging the number of ballots at every step. They mention the extra security needed when voters send copies of identity documents to cure their signature rejection. The Election Assistance Commission notes that signatures over 10 years old are another problem and recommends Hawaii's practice of inviting every voter to send a new signature. California researchers recommended that the public needs easy access to see the signature on file before mailing in ballots, to further maximize matches. The National Vote at Home Institute recommends state-wide or regional centers for signature verification to increase transparency. and reduce the insider risks of temporary local staff, though the Election Advisory Commission notes that shared equipment may not be consistent with local chain of custody requirements, and that public bidding may take months.  Blue shift  Blue shift is an observed phenomenon under which in-person votes overstate the true final percent of votes for the Republican Party (whose color is red), while provisional votes, which are counted later, overstate the true final percent of votes for the Democratic Party (whose color is blue). This means that election day results can initially indicate a Republican victory, but mail-in ballots later demonstrate a Democratic victory. This can lead observers to call into question the election legitimacy, when in fact, the election results are legitimate. Blue shift occurs because young voters, low-income voters, and voters who move often, are likely to vote by mail and are likely to lean Democratic. The phenomenon was first identified by Edward Foley of Ohio State University in 2013. He found that Democratic candidates are significantly more likely to gain votes during the canvass period, which is the votes counted after election night. This asymmetry did not always exist, as in the 20th century, as recently as the 1996 United States presidential election, Republicans and Democrats were both able to cut their opponents' lead during the canvass period. Foley conjectured that the 2002 passage of the Help America Vote Act accelerated the pronounced asymmetry of the blue shift phenomenon, because it required states to allow provisional ballots to be cast. He later found that the variation in the size of the blue shift is positively associated with the number of provisional ballots and the Democratic partisanship of the state in question. The growth in the persistent blue-shifted overtime vote began with the 2004 United States presidential election. Other challenges In the case of all-postal voting, or a high proportion of postal votes, there cannot be traditional \\"Election Night\\" news coverage in which the results are delivered within hours after polls close, as it takes several days to deliver and count ballots. As a result it may require several days beyond the mail-in deadline before results can be publicized. Postal voting depends on the viability of the postal service. As of early 2020, the U.S. Postal Service has \\"a negative net worth of $65 billion and an additional $140 billion in unfunded liabilities.\\" This financial crisis has become more pressing amidst the coronavirus pandemic, as the $2 trillion economic stimulus package did not include money for the postal service. As a result, the postal servicedespite its widespread use for delivering food and medicinemay have to close in June, before the November 2020 presidential election. Alternatives An increasing number of states in the US now allow drive-thru voting. In the process voters leave their absentee ballots in a drop box at designated locations. Some locations allow drop-off voting 24/7. Many states provide voters with multiple ways to return their ballot: by mail, via in person secure drop boxes, and at voting centers where they can get questions answered, replacement ballots, etc. Oregon now has 300 drop boxes across the state in the weeks leading up to each election, and more voters now cast their ballot in person than by return mail. The term \\"vote at home\\" is starting to replace \\"vote by mail\\" for that reason. California's roll-out of vote-by-mail is incorporating voting centers as a key part of their effort. Anchorage's successful pilot included many drop boxes and some voting centers.

In the event of a successful test phase, this measure can be implemented permanently. Especially in times of Covid -19 the pop-up bike lane is also known as corona cycle path and is in this meaning an emergency bike lane set up at short notice to quickly provide more space and safety for cyclists in an acute danger or crisis situation or in the event of sudden changes in road traffic conditionsSenat gibt Berliner Bezirken Tipps f√ºr Pop- up-Radwege (29. April 2020). . As all pop-up bike lanes it is a temporary solution with the potential to become permanent even after the crisis situation. Pop-up cycle paths were arranged in several cities during the COVID-19 pandemic and are usually intended as temporary cycling infrastructure for the time during the causal event. Cycle lanes arranged during the pandemic are intended to help cyclists to maintain spatial distance in order to minimise the risk of infection with the SARS CoV-2 virus. Other reasons for Pop-Up-Bike-Lanes during the pandemic are to relieve public transport, the use of which is associated with an increased risk of infection, and to promote physical activity and thus strengthen the immune systemKrisenfestes Radfahren: Die Corona-Pop-Up-Radwege in Berlin. (29. April 2020). .

Mai 2020). .  History  The term \\"pop-up bike lane\\" originated in North America, where, for example, the US city of New York had launched a number of experiments with short-term cycling infrastructureAnja Kr√ºger: Neue Radwege durch Coronakrise: Impuls aus Bogot√°. In: Die Tageszeitung: taz. 2. Mai 2020, ISSN 0931-9085 taz.de (4. Mai 2020). . The COVID-19 pandemic led to the creation of more space for bicycle traffic in Colombia, initially in the capital city of Bogot√°, over a total of more than one hundred kilometres of main roads. The measure was reported internationally. In Germany, pop-up cycle paths were initially set up in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. The first pop-up cycle path in Berlin was created on 25 March 2020 at Hallesches Ufer. The pop-up cycle paths in Berlin were laid out for a limited period until 31 May 2020, with the prospect of a transfer to a permanent cycle infrastructure in accordance with the Berlin Mobility Act. However, the deadline was extended at the end of May until the end of the year. Mexico City announced a 54 kilometers pop up lane in Av Insurgentes and Eje 4 to create a mobility alternative to help decrease mass transit agglomeration in Metrobus lines. Its permanence will be evaluated according to use. Other Mexican cities that created pop up bike lanes are Zapopan in Jalisco, San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a in Nuevo Le√≥n and Puebla, Puebla. .  Concept  The Berlin Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district authority recommends a concept, after which pop-up cycle paths can be set up within ten days and in eleven steps, from the identification of the areas affected, consultation with the authorities to be involved, the ordering of measures and temporary signage, to completion. The following four basic principles are applied in the design process: * traffic separation: physical separation of foot, bicycle and car traffic beyond markings, which, if possible, does not need to be crossed by car traffic for parking * Forgiving infrastructure: infrastructure that minimises the risk of injury in the event of misbehaviour, for example by means of safety distances between the carriageway and the kerb or guide beacons or the use of separation elements made of yielding materials * Predictability: easily understandable and less complex traffic routing * Network approach: Establishment of a transport network to relieve individual road sections On roads with two lanes in both directions, the right-hand lane including a buffer zone for flowing motorised traffic is completely separated as a cycle lane and existing signs for stationary traffic are covered. Parking of motor vehicles is then no longer permitted and driving is possible on one strip for both cyclists and motorised traffic. On roads with two lanes and a parking strip in both directions, the right lane for cycle traffic, including a buffer zone for both stationary and moving motorised traffic, is separated and the parking strip is maintained. Motorised traffic can then drive on one lane in each direction. In this case, however, vehicles must cross the cycle lane when parking or entering, which is contrary to the above-mentioned principle of traffic separation. On roads with three lanes in each direction, where parking is allowed on the right lane, the right lane is separated as a cycle lane with a buffer zone to the middle lane and the middle lane is designated as a parking lane, so that flowing motorised traffic, stationary motorised traffic and cycle traffic are each provided with one lane. At crossroads with traffic lights, there are possible measures to protect straight ahead or right-hand cycle traffic from motorised traffic turning right. This includes the creation of a temporary protected intersection with temporary kerbstone extensions or alternatively traffic light phases with separate, exclusive green phases for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. If this is not possible, it is recommended to switch the green phase for cyclists before the green phase for motorised traffichttps://www.mobycon.nl/wp- content/uploads/2020/04/6796_Kreuzberg_Handbuch-V4.pdf .  Political debate in Germany  The establishment of pop-up cycle paths in Berlin by the red- red-green senate was praised by cycling associations such as the ADFC and the associations around the Initiative Volksentscheid Fahrrad and was mostly positively received in the social media Der Mann hinter den Pop-Up-Radwegen. (29. April 2020). The Berlin-Brandenburg regional association of the ADAC criticised the measure and said that the senate would exploit an emergency situation to pursue particular interests. The CDU and FDP also accused the senate of instrumentalizing the pandemic to turn traffic aroundClaudius Pr√∂√üer: Neue Rad-Infrastruktur gegen Corona: Mit Abstand am ges√ºndesten. In: taz. 6. April 2020 (30. April 2020).. The AfD spoke of \\"left-wing car-hating policies\\" and pointed to a decrease in the number of cyclists compared to last year. The ADFC, on the other hand, stated that the total number of distances travelled in the Corona crisis had decreased overall and evaluations by the traffic information centre and public transport showed \\"that this was far more drastically the case with car traffic, buses and trains than with cycling\\" Neue R√§der f√ºr die Saison. (29. April 2020).. As other cities in Germany initially did not want to set up temporary cycle paths, Deutsche Umwelthilfe sent applications to 204 city administrations, whereupon the cities of Cologne, Frankfurt am Main and Dresden, among others, wanted to consider the option. In several cities, including Stuttgart, cycling associations organised campaigns calling for the creation of pop-up cycle paths. After a female cyclist coming from a pop-up cycle path was killed by a truck driver turning right at the intersection of Petersburger Stra√üe and M√ºhsamstra√üe in June 2020, Siegfried Brockmann, head of the accident research department of the insurers, criticised that pop-up cycle paths alone would not provide a safe solution for the intersection areas as the main danger spots and would thus make people think they were safe. In order to achieve sufficient safety, the intersections would have to be rebuilt and the traffic lights changed. Brockmann also criticised the short-term installation of the cycle paths without prior measurement of the respective traffic flows. The senate administration replied that the police were involved in every installation of a pop-up cycle path, \\"in order to consider safety aspects of the respective location together with the road traffic authority\\". The situation at crossroads and junctions would only change as a result of the provisional cycle lanes to the extent that the visibility conditions would improve significantly in each caseChristian Latz und Beatrix Fricke: Berlin: Nach t√∂dlichem Radunfall mit Betonmischer: Experte kritisiert Pop-up-Radwege. 4.

The house was designed by Charles Barry for the banker William Currie. The East Horsley estate was later sold to William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace who undertook two major expansions of the house to his own designs. Lovelace lived at the Towers with his wife, Ada, daughter of Lord Byron, a pioneering mathematician, friend of Charles Babbage and described as among the first computer programmers. In 1919, the Towers was purchased by Thomas Sopwith, the aviator and businessman, who named his plane, the Hawker Horsley, after his home. Now a wedding and conference venue, Horsley Towers is a Grade II* listed building. History William Currie was a banker and distiller, who had inherited a substantial fortune from his father, on the latter's death in 1781. In 1820, Currie engaged Charles Barry to replace the existing Georgian manor house on his East Horsley estate. It was an early commission for Barry, then aged 25, who opened the London office of his architectural practice only in 1821. Following Currie's death in 1829, the Horsley estate was bought by William King, who was raised in the peerage to Earl of Lovelace in 1838 and served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey from 1840 until his death in 1893. King had married Augusta Ada Byron, Lord Byron's only legitimate offspring in 1833. Lovelace, who began his career as a diplomat, turned to scientific investigation and engineering after inheriting his title. A roof truss in the great hall he designed at Horsley carries an inscription recording that Lovelace had moulded the beam with the use of steam. Ada gained even greater prominence for her scientific endeavours; through her friendship with Charles Babbage she wrote a commentary on his analytical engine, arguably the earliest mechanical computer. Her commentary has been described as containing \\"one of the earliest computer programmes\\". In 1919 the third earl sold the East Horsley estate to Thomas Sopwith, the aviator and businessman for ¬£150,000. While resident at the Towers, Sopwith named one of his aircraft, the Hawker Horsley, after the house. After World War II, the house was purchased by the Electricity Council for use as a management training college. It is now a wedding and conference venue operated by De Vere. Architecture and description Pevsner describes the approach to the Towers as \\"one of the most sensational in England\\". The core of the present house is Barry's building of 1820-1829, undertaken in the Tudor Revival style. This is enveloped with a great hall, built by Lovelace in 1849, and by even larger flanking towers, in Romanesque and Rhenish styles, and a chapel, all dating from 1859 and after, and drawing inspiration from a long European tour Lovelace undertook following Ada's death in 1852. The whole is encircled by a complex of walls, tunnels, arches, bastions and a lengthy cloister. The construction materials are mainly local flint and brick, Lovelace purchasing a brickworks at Ockham to ensure a ready supply. Horsley Towers is a Grade II* listed building. The flanking walls and pavilions to the northwest and southwest, the entrance walls and lodges, one of which Nairn describes as \\"particularly violent\\", and the walls to the former kitchen garden, all have their own Grade II listings. Neither Barry nor Lovelace's efforts have been much appreciated by critics. The Victorian Web notes that \\"the building, like much Victorian gothic, displays a good deal of eccentricity and mixes many styles\\". Ian Nairn, the main author of the Surrey Pevsner, wrote of Barry's Tudor Revival house; \\"a sober, dull design with the [...] lack of enthusiasm which taints so many of Barry's non-Classical building\\". Of Lovelace's work, Mark Girouard, the architectural historian, described the \\"extraordinary embellishments, in flint and polychrome brick made by the Earl, working to his own designs\\". The writer John Julius Norwich considered the whole \\"a grotesque Victorian Disneyland which has to be seen to be believed - and may not be even then\\", concluding that, unusually, his inclusion of Horsley Towers in his study The Architecture of Southern England, should serve as a warning rather than an inducement.

Early life  Dapiran received a double degree (BA/LLB) in Chinese and Law from the University Of Melbourne in 1998. As an undergraduate student, he also spent time at Peking University, where he acquired certificates in economic law and Chinese.  Legal career  After graduating from the University of Melbourne, Dapiran moved to Hong Kong in 1999 and joined the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, where he eventually made partner and was put in charge of the firm's Beijing office. In 2010, he joined the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and established its Hong Kong office. In 2017, Dapiran joined Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom's Hong Kong office as Of Counsel, but left the firm in 2019 to focus on his writing on the 2019-2020 Hong Kong Protests. During his legal career, Dapiran has specialised in corporate law, in particular the initial public offerings of Chinese state owned enterprises. He has been involved in IPOs that have raised almost US$80 billion in total. Dapiran rose to prominence for \\"representing large Chinese state-owned enterprises such as the Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the People s Insurance Company of China and China International Capital Corp. on overseas listings and cross- border transactions.\\" According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Dapiran \\"is probably the only foreign lawyer to have advised on three out of four of China‚Äôs megabank IPOs.\\" Most notably, Dapiran worked on the US$22.1 billion IPO of the Agricultural Bank of China in 2010, which was the biggest in history at the time.  Writer and commentator  In 2017, Dapiran published his first book City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong with Penguin Books, which dealt with the history of protest movements in Hong Kong since the 1960s. In the book, Dapiran particularly focuses on the 2014 Hong Kong Protests. According to Dapiran, witnessing these protests made him \\"realise my identity as a Hongkonger.\\" Since the publication of Dapiran's first book, he has become one of the leading Western commentators on Hong Kong protest movements, in particular during the 2019-2020 Hong Kong Protests. He has been praised in the South China Morning Post as being \\"renowned as a clear-eyed observer of the city‚Äôs politics\\" and is often quoted as an expert on Hong Kong by media such as Quartz, the Financial Times or Time'. Writing in publications such as The Guardian, The Atlantic, New Statesman, CNN and Foreign Policy and appearing on programs like the BBC, Bloomberg TV, Reuters, RTHK and ABC, Dapiran has been highly critical of the Hong Kong government and the Chinese central government in Beijing, asserting, for example, that \\"the Hong Kong government is no longer acting in the best interests of its people,\\" that \\"Beijing has taken advantage of global distraction [due to the outbreak of Covid-19] to begin taking retribution for Hong Kong‚Äôs open defiance of China‚Äôs rule\\" in 2019, and that the Chinese government uses the law to act against the opposition in Hong Kong. In July 2020, he claimed that the Chinese government is acting like a \\"colonial power\\" in Hong Kong and that \\"the U.S. measures, alongside Beijing‚Äôs own crackdown on Hong Kong, are fast turning the city from an open, stable international financial center to contested ground at the very front lines of a rapidly intensifying geopolitical conflict.\\" Since 2020, he also writes a regular column for the Hong Kong Outlet Citizen News. In 2020, Dapiran published his second book, City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong. The book chronicles the Hong Kong protests of 2019, often retelling Dapiran's first hand experience of visiting protest sites such as the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. While the book received some positive reviews, certain reviewers critically noted that the book was obviously written in support of the protest movement, thus lacking in balance. In October 2020 City on Fire was longlisted for the Walkley Book Award.  Publications  * City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong.

Biography Armand Blanquet du Chayla was born on 10 April 1887 in Brest, France. He was ordained a priest of the Discalced Carmelites on 23 December 1892. His Carmelite name was Father Stephen of the Sacred Heart. On 18 April 1939 Pope Pius XII appointed him Archbishop of Baghdad. He received his episcopal consecration on 29 June 1939 from Cardinal Achille Li√©nart, Bishop of Lille. His appointment came at a delicate juncture, when the Iraqi government was suspicious of the French, but he was at least familiar as head of the Carmelite mission and did not add yet another competing personality to the Catholic leadership. His success in distancing himself from French interests made possible his assumption of diplomatic duties on behalf of the Holy See a decade later. On 20 November 1948, Pope Pius named him Apostolic Delegate to Iraq. He resigned as Delegate and Archbishop of Baghdad on 17 September 1964 at the age of 77 and was assigned the titular see of Darcos. His resignation was prompted by health problems. Blanquet du Chayla died on 27 November 1970 at the age of 83. References ;Additional sources * External links * image.

Description Jean-Jacques Barth√©lemy's book was a fanciful but learned imaginary travel journal, one of the first historical novels, which a modern scholar has called \\"the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique\\" in the late 18th century. It had a high impact on the growth of philhellenism in France, Europe and the United States: the book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and was translated into German and other languages. It later inspired European sympathy for the Greek War of Independence and spawned sequels and imitations throughout the 19th century. According to a contemporary English literary review: The work also contained numerous maps and engravings of high quality, made by geographer and cartographist Jean-Denis Barbi√© Du Bocage (1760-1825).

The archaeologist Ian Kinnes classed the Preston Candover example alongside the Badshot Lea Long Barrow in Surrey as the two known examples located on the North Downs. Finds A spearhead and a seax probably dating from the seventh or eighth century, during England's early medieval period, have been recovered from the Preston Candover Barrow. In the late nineteenth century, an iron spearhead was recovered from inside the barrow. T. W. Shore thought it might be Early Iron Age in date, although Christopher Hawkes later established that it was early medieval, of a style dating from the fifth, sixth, or seventh century. A scramasax was also reported as having been found from the edge of the barrow, and was in the collection of Basingstoke Museum by the late 1930s. Writing in 1940, Hawkes expressed hope that archaeological excavation might reveal more about early medieval activity at the barrow. Archaeological investigation In the late nineteenth century, the Reverend Sumner Wilson and T. W. Shore expressed the opinion that the Preston Candover barrow was stylistically a long barrow. O. G. S. Crawford disagreed with this assessment and on the Ordnance Survey map it was instead classified as a round barrow. Two other individuals, G. W. Willis of Basingstoke Museum and J. R. Ellaway, subsequently informed Hawkes that the original identification was correct, and that the tumulus had only taken on the appearance of a round barrow after being deformed by agricultural levelling in recent decades.

Higher derivative theories and negative energies  Following the important insights of several authors, Pav≈°iƒç has found that in the presence of physically realistic interaction potentials, bounded from below and from above, the systems with negative energies are stable. As an example, he studied the Pais- Uhlenbeck oscillator in the presence of a bounded interaction term.

The film premiered at 21st MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2019, where it won the inaugural Manish Acharya Award for New Voices in Indian Cinema. The film chronicles two decades of a family house in a small village in Darbhanga, Bihar. Plot Summer of 1998: a family has reunited at their ancestral home to celebrate a new birth in the family. It's a joyous, carefree occasion, with trips to the mango grove, game of cards, feast, and light-hearted conversations. Autumn of 2010: The landscape of the village has changed significantly. Awkward lunch conversations, formality in speech, and undiscussed decisions, show that the family is not as close as it used to be. While the elders struggle with tangled family dynamics, the younger ones reminisce about the old times with fondness, digging up old family photos and memorabilia. Winter of 2019: Engulfed in a dense fog, the house feels like a ghost of its former self. Nobody visits the house anymore, and the neglect is visible in the mouldy walls, flaking-off plaster, and unhinged doors.

Writing for Rediff.com, Aseem Chhabra compared the film to the works of Yasujiro Ozu and Hirokazu Kore-eda.

It was formed in January 1942 as the 111th Separate Cavalry Division. Formed as a Kalmyk national division, its personnel were drawn from the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On 4 March, the Soviet High Command disbanded 20 randomly chosen cavalry divisions after deeming cavalry to be less effective than expected. The 111th Separate Cavalry Division was disbanded on 12 March, its best cadres and equipment being transferred to the 110th Separate Cavalry Division. Background Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, the latter suffered massive casualties. Over one hundred Soviet divisions were disbanded due to losses in manpower. The Soviet State Defense Committee initiated the formation of hundreds of new divisions which were quickly forwarded to the front lines. Losses of materiel among the tank divisions and mechanized corps, meant that cavalry divisions remained the only tool available for the execution of deep operations and raids. On 13 November 1941, following the suggestion of General Inspector of the Cavalry Oka Gorodovikov, the Soviets began forming 20 National Cavalry Divisions and 15 National Rifle Brigades. The new units drew upon the peoples of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union, in Northern Caucasus, Central Asia, the Urals and the Lower Volga Region. Unlike typical cavalry divisions, National Cavalry Divisions were equipped and sustained using the funds of the respective republics and their formation was overseen by the local communist party committees. Most officers were appointed from among the native nationality, in order to prevent the development of a language barrier. Formation and dissolution On 20 November 1941, Deputy Defense Narkom Efim Shadenko ordered the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to form the 110th and 111th Separate Cavalry Divisions by January 1942. Most Kalmyks had only recently transitioned to sedentism, severely limiting the number of settlements that could host the new divisions. The 3,498 man strong 111th Separate O.I. Gorodovikov Cavalry Division was to be formed in the Esto-Haginskoe, Nemetsko- Haginskoe and Sch√∂nfeld semi-abandoned villages formerly inhabited by deported Volga Germans. Men were drafted from Zapadniy, Yashaltinsky, Pritutnenskiy, Troitskiy, Chernozemelniy and Dolbanskiy Uluses, located in the west and center of the republic; as well as its capital Elista. Since the command staff had departed the republic, the first temporary commander of the division was appointed by the local political authorities. N. Zimin assumed command. In January 1942, command was transferred to Colonel Grigory Belousov. Mobilization and training lagged behind schedule since over 16,000 Kalmyks were employed in various engineering projects around the Caucasus. As of 20 January 1942, the 111th Division had reached a strength of 2,597 men and 1,673 horses. On 23 February, the 111th Separate Cavalry Division received its military banner and its 3,276 soldiers took the military oath. On the same day its size was expanded to 4,494 men, while soldiers were assigned to their respective units within it. As of 1 March, the 111th Division had reached a strength of 4,644 men, recruiting privates in excess of the goal set. On 4 March, the Soviet High Command disbanded 20 cavalry divisions after deeming cavalry to be less effective than expected. Despite the fact that the 111th Separate Cavalry Division was better equipped and manned it was chosen randomly and disbanded on 12 March. Its best cadres and equipment being transferred to the 110th Separate Cavalry Division. A total of 197 of the division's officers and 3,031 privates were divided between various reserve units or placed at the disposal of regional military directorates across the Caucasus.

The club is nicknamed the Bulldogs and represents the towns of Lyndoch and Williamstown. The club was formed in 1979 following the merger of the Lyndoch and Williamstown Rovers football clubs that competed in the Gawler & District Football League.  Club History = Lyndoch FC  The Lyndoch Football Club was reformed in 1947 after the end of World War II and competed in the Lower North Football Association along with clubs in Greenock, Kangaroo Flat, Roseworthy, Sandy Creek, Smithfield and Truro. Lyndoch had won three premierships before the Lower North league folded in 1954, which resulted in the club going into recess. Lyndoch Football Club were based at Lyndoch Oval where they shared the venue with the Lyndoch Cricket Club. Lyndoch reformed again in 1960 and began competition in the Gawler & District Football Association. They won the 1965 premiership beating Gawler 8.7.55 to 7.9.51 at Gawler Oval. However, that would be their last ever flag, despite grand final appearances in 1966, 1972, 1974 and 1978. The club merged with Williamstown Rovers the following year after the 1979 season. The Lyndoch FC 1965 premiership reunion was held in 2015 at the Lyndoch pavilion to celebrate 50 years since the club's last premiership.  Williamstown Rovers FC  The Williamstown FC was based at Queen Victoria Jubilee Park in Williamstown which is Barossa District's current home ground and previously had the same colours of blue and gold as Lyndoch, as they had previously competed in the Torrens Valley Football Association until 1962, but changed to the Saints colours when they left the Hills Football League in 1973, as Lyndoch already donned the same colours. The competing clubs in the Gawler & District Football Association were Gawler Central, Willaston, Roseworthy and Lyndoch. Williamstown won the 1961 premiership after going through the entire season undefeated. However the club went into recess in 1963 due to a lack of player numbers. Williamstown Rovers FC was founded in 1967 as a predecessor of the former club that went into recess and competed in the Hills Football League zone 2. Other competing teams in the competition were Pleasant Valley, Gumeracha, Woodside Army, Lenswood Ranges, Birdwood, Sedan Cambrai and Mount Torrens. Throughout the club's history a premiership never arrived despite some reasonably good on field performance where the club would only just fall short of making a Grand Final. Williamstown Rovers would merge with Lyndoch after the 1979 season.  Barossa District FC  Both former clubs Lyndoch and Williamstown Rovers had a long-lasting rivalry in both the Torrens Valley and Gawler & District leagues, with the meeting being held on November 7, 1979 where the decision was made to merge the two clubs. The club was named Barossa District after the local council area and the club wanted 'neutral colours', donning the red, white and blue, and the same of the Central District Football Club. The guernsey consisted of a blue design with a red and white V with the Bulldogs logo. The first year of competition for the new club was slow but earned a Finals spot after winning the last 8 games of the home and away season, despite being eliminated early. Games were spread at both Lyndoch and Williamstown in Barossa District's early years. The 1981 season saw Barossa District lacking the quality players needed to be competitive enough to reach Finals, but that changed the following year when the maiden day came in 1982 when they won their first premiership. However, injuries of key players prevented the Bulldogs from making Finals in 1983, and the club's lack of Finals competition continued until 1987 when the move was made to the Hills Football League zone 2 following the amalgamation between the Gawler and Barossa & Light leagues. During the club's four-year stint competing with clubs in and around the Adelaide Hills three more premierships were won in 1987, 1988 and 1990 beating Mount Torrens, Kersbrook and Nairne Bremer. There was increasing pressure for the club to move to the Barossa Light & Gawler Football Association following the 1990 premiership. Senior and junior football and netball were playing at many different venues at once and many involved with the club wished for a move to the Barossa league which provided a more family friendly environment. With enough support, Barossa District entered the BL&GFA; for the 1991 season. However, this would not only see a premiership drought but also a lack of on field success for the club also, with their only Finals appearances in 1995. The late 1990s would see the Bulldogs plummet even further, winning only one game in 1998 and 1999. The early 2000s saw the continued lack of on field success despite efforts by members of the club to promote development of the club through junior development, fundraising and facility extension. The umpire changerooms, facilities for trainers, a handicapped toilet and a committee room were added in 2002 but the poor on field success and small number of games won continued which resulted in the loss of funds that were raised within the club. Things started looking better in 2005 when the club received funds from a loaned vineyard, hosted the Grand Final at Nuriootpa and recruited coach Steve O'Connor who turned things around even more for the Bulldogs to win their first BL&GFA; flag the following season in 2006. The Bulldogs made five straight Grand Finals from 2006 to 2010, winning both 2006 and 2007 over Freeling but losing to Tanunda in 2008, 2009 and 2010. 2011 saw Barossa District finish 3rd and make Finals despite being defeated by Willaston after the opposition called a player count at the beginning of the 3rd quarter, believing Barossa District had a 19th man on the field when the quarter hadn't officially started and the player was just metres away from leaving the field of play. The following 2012 season saw Barossa District beat South Gawler and Kapunda to reach the Grand Final, after finishing 4th during the season, to oppose a strong Tanunda outfit who were going for their 5th consecutive premiership. Barossa District overcame the opposition and soundly beat the Magpies by 26 points. A thrilling encounter ensued in the following 2013 decider between Gawler Central and Barossa District, the Bulldogs again emerging victorious, this time by 5 points. Both 2014 and 2015 saw the Bulldogs miss the Finals but premiership success returned for the following two seasons in 2016 and 2017, beating a previously undefeated Gawler Central by 11 points and edging out Kapunda as underdogs in the 2017 Grand Final by 13 points. The most recent season of 2019 saw Barossa District finish 4th and make Finals, beating Freeling in an elimination final before falling to Nuriootpa the following week.

Fatati also served as a bishop in both Teramo and Siena; he was an assistant bishop in the latter position to Cardinal Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini (the future Pope Pius III and the nephew to the then- Pope Pius II). He also happened to secure favor from various popes due to his work and important positions within the Papal States; his positions included treasurer and canon among others. His reputation for holiness was noted throughout his episcopal career and longstanding public devotion to him allowed for Pope Pius VI to confirm his beatification in mid-1795. Life Antonio Fatati was born in Ancona in the Papal States circa 1410 to the nobles Simone Fatati and Buzia dei Lavaroni; he came from a line of municipal officials. His two brothers were Marino and Iacopo. Fatati studied in Bologna before his ordination to the priesthood. Bishop Astorgio Agnesi appointed him as a canon and archpriest for the San Ciriaco cathedral on 5 November 1431 while he served as the vicar general for Ragusa from 1440 to October 1441 to replace Archbishop Antonio Venieri (his sister-in-law's uncle). Pope Eugene IV appointed him as an abbot for the San Pietro al Conero convent in 1440. Pope Nicholas V also held Fatati in high esteem and named him as a canon for Saint Peter's Basilica on 4 June 1447 while giving him other important positions in the Papal States. The pope also made him a cleric in the Apostolic Camera in 1449. The King of Naples Alfonso V of Aragon became impressed with Fatati and made him one of his councilors in 1456. He received his appointment from Pope Nicholas V as the Bishop for Teramo on 6 November 1450 but was forced to reside in Macerata given his other duties in service to the Papal States. He did not believe he could run a diocese when he learnt about his appointment due to his several other important positions that confined him to Macerata instead. Fatati also convoked a diocesan synod on 11 March 1459 which the new Pope Pius II appreciated due to Fatati's desire for diocesan reform and renewal. His tenure lasted until 1460 when Pope Pius II made him an assistant bishop for Siena to help his nephew Cardinal Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini (the future Pope Pius III). The pope was impressed with Fatati's management that he appointed him as the Bishop for Ancona e Unama on 3 November 1463 (he held this position until his death). Fatati accompanied Pius II to the Mantua Congress in 1459 while hosting the pope in his diocese; the pope died there in 1464 in the middle of planning a crusade against the Ottoman Turks. Pope Paul II also was impressed with his abilities and named him as the treasurer for Bologna for the 1466 to 1470 period while his successor Pope Sixtus IV also valued his management and diocesan organization. Fatati died in his diocese on 9 January 1484; his remains were interred in the diocesan cathedral. His remains were found incorrupt after their exhumation in 1529 while a new sarcophagus was commissioned in 1795. Beatification The formal cause for his eventual beatification was launched in 1652 and culminated when Pope Pius VI beatified him on 9 May 1765.

The affair played out prominently in the French media.  Background and investigation  On 12 April, the brigade de r√©pression du prox√©n√©tisme, an anti-prostitution unit of the French National Police, launched a raid on a Parisian late-night bar. An anonymous tip targeting Abousofiane Mousta√Ød, known as Abou Sofiane, was the source of the investigation. He was suspected of pimping. Several prostitutes were arrested as a result of the raid, with four persons being are indicted shortly afterwards. Subsequent hearings revealed that four players of the French football team were among the bar's clients and that one of the prostitutes was a minor at the time of the events. The four players were identified as Hatem Ben Arfa, Karim Benzema, Sydney Govou and Franck Rib√©ry. According to press reports, the latter admitted to investigators that he had been seeing the underage prostitute since 2009, while claiming to be unaware that she was a minor at the time of their meeting. Zahia Dehar was questioned three times in April 2010. According to the testimonies, she claimed to have had paid sex with Govou, Rib√©ry and Benzema, and stated that she had been a minor when she had sex with the latter two. According to Dehar, she never disclosed to her clients that she was a minor. She also claimed that Rib√©ry had flown her to Munich to entertain him on his birthday. In May, Dehar defended the footballers in a letter to the national team‚Äôs coach, Raymond Domenech, asking him to disregard the case when choosing his squad for the FIFA World Cup that year: \\"How could I have imagined, when I've always hidden my age, that their good faith could one day be called into question?\\" The French Football Federation (FFF) claimed that it was not aware of any letter. In July, Benzema and Rib√©ry were indicted for solicitation of an underage prostitute. At the end of 2011, the Paris public prosecutor's office dismissed three of the six protagonists in the case, the two players and Ribery's brother-in-law. In August 2012, the players were referred by the examining magistrate to the Paris criminal court to be tried for solicitation of an underage prostitute.  Trial  The trial of Rib√©ry and Benzema began in Paris in January 2014 following a postponement in 2013. The prosecutor's office maintained that the players did not know that Dehar was a minor at the time of the events, which the examining magistrate disputed. During the investigation, Rib√©ry denied having paid Dehar for sexual relations. On 30 January 2014, after a 10-day trial, the court dropped the charges against Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema. The five other defendants, including Abousofiane Mousta√Ød, Georges Farhat, √âlie Farhat and Kamel Ramdani, were found guilty of pimping, and received sentences ranging from suspended prison sentences to hard time. Abu Sofiane appealed and published a book, Zahia Killed Me, in which he defended his claim to innocence. However, in June 2015, the Court of Appeal confirmed his conviction and increased his sentence. The case has been extensively covered by Le Point. According to an article published by the news magazine in 2015, a former prostitute under the pseudonym \\"Sarah\\" revealed that Zahia Dehar had allegedly been prostituted by Yves Bouvier, a Swiss art dealer. She claims to have met Dehar during libertine evenings organised by Yves Bouvier for which the women received ‚Ç¨2000 in cash from Bouvier. The newspaper's editorial staff, as well as the journalists Christophe Labb√© and M√©lanie Delattre, who had been the first to break this story, were subsequently sued for defamation by the Swissman. A similar complaint was filed against VSD. Bouvier won his case against Le Point.  2020 allegations  In 2020, the former prostitute testified again, claiming that Yves Bouvier had engaged in witness tampering. She claimed Bouvier had forced her to stay in a hotel to prevent her from appearing in court to testify against him in the trial against Le Point. In February 2020, the lawyer of convicted pimp Abousofiane Mousta√Ød, Yassine Bouzrou, asked for his client's case to be revived based on the former prostitute's testimony. This testimony calls into question the veracity of Zahia Dehar's statement, which was heard by the brigade de r√©pression du prox√©n√©tisme in 2010, at the time when the scandal of her paid sex with certain footballers broke out in the run-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

During their time at college, they decided to take their band to a professional level. The name \\"Lucky Chops\\" was proposed by the band's original trumpet player, Daniel Ratkowski, during a word-association brainstorming session and refers to the fact that all of their instruments (except the drums) are wind. Their early music was mainly covers and mash-ups of other songs. Their origninal works are influenced by the vast mix of cultures in NYC and are very personal to the member of the band who wrote the piece in question. This means the band performs a wide variety of musical styles and are not bound by a single genre. The band had a steady start, playing in the New York Subway for commuters. They gained brief internet fame from a 2016 YouTube video showing their rendition of \\"Funky Town\\" and \\"I Got You (I Feel Good)\\" featuring Leo P, which helped to significantly boost their popularity. Now they perform all over the world. Around the time of their internet fame, they released their first album: Lucky Chops NYC.

The name of the project is derived from one of the first Greek deities, Gaia, who arose from chaos and who, in mythology, stands as the personified earth for the woman giving birth. The project was first presented to the general public at the Digital Summit 2019 in Dortmund (Germany) and has been continuously developed since then. To achieve its goals, the GAIA-X Association AISBL is in foundation as an international non-profit organization based in Belgium to develop a European project, initiated by France and Germany, to create a proposal for the next generation of a data infrastructure for Europe, and foster digital sovereignty of European users of cloud services. It is based on European values of transparency, openness, data protection and security.  Goals  The objective is to design the next generation of a European data infrastructure. Common requirements for a European data infrastructure will be developed. Against this background, openness, transparency and European connectivity are central to GAIA-X according to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. Representatives from several European countries are actively involved in the project. The digital ecosystem is supposed to ensure that companies and business models from Europe can be competitive. The implementation of GAIA-X is not intended to create a competing product to existing offers (e.g. hyperscalers). GAIA-X will link different elements via open interfaces and standards to link data and make them available to a broad audience. GAIA-X will enable the creatione ofan different types of innovation platforms.  Solutions  According to its own project statement, the project objectives are to be achieved by combining existing central and decentralised infrastructures to form a system which together form a \\"digital ecosystem\\". Characteristics of this ecosystem are: * The use of secure, open technologies (see for example Open Source, Open Hardware), * clearly identifiable GAIA nodes, * software components from a common repository, * standards based on common values and relevant regulations of the EU and its member states, * uniform data and service room. GAIA-X is said to offer the following added value from a data and infrastructure perspective: * It should enable a sovereign decision on data-based business models. * It is intended to support innovative cross-sector cooperation in order to aggregate and increase the value of data. * Fair and transparent business models should be promoted by providing rules and standards for cooperative approaches, including the legally compliant use of data. * Common models and rules for data monetization should reduce the complexity and costs of commercializing data. * Cross- industry cooperation to create federal, interoperable services will be facilitated. * Access to secure, trustworthy and modern IT infrastructures (automated services and API-controlled infrastructures), which increase productivity in software development, is to be facilitated. * The loss of company data is to be significantly reduced by recognising and maintaining protection classes and regulations on confidentiality when exchanging data.  GAIA-X Association AISBL (in foundation)  In order to achieve the GAIA-X project goals, it was announced in June 2020 that an international non-profit organisation will be established with headquarters in Brussels. The GAIA-X Association is to be established in the form of an international non-profit association under Belgian law (frz. association internationale sans but lucratif, short: AISBL) with its headquarters in Brussels. The legal form underlines the European and international perspective and openness of GAIA-X. The founding members on the German side include Beckhoff Automation, BMW, Bosch, DE-CIX, Deutsche Telekom, German Edge Cloud, PlusServer, SAP and Siemens. In addition, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the International Data Spaces Association and the European cloud provider association Cispe are co- founders of the GAIA-X Association. On the French side, Amadeus, Atos, Docaposte, EDF - √âlectricit√© de France, IMT - Institut Mines-T√©l√©com, Orange, Outscale, OVHcloud, Safran and Scaleway are among the participants. The development of the necessary components will also be pursued.  Political support  GAIA-X has been initiated as a project by the German Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier, immediately supported by the French Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire during the summer 2019. A first common press release from Peter Altmaier and Bruno Le Maire was issued in October 2019. A first Franco-German Position Paper was published February 18, 2020.https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/F/franco-german-position-on- gaia-x.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v;=10 A specific joined press conference took place with both Ministers Peter Altmaier and Bruno Le Maire in June 2020 (source: programme), including the announcement on the GAIA-X Association AISBL by the 22 founding members.

Turner is an American evolutionary biologist and virologist, the Rachel Carson Professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, and a faculty member in microbiology at the Yale School of Medicine. His research focuses on the evolutionary genetics of viruses, particularly bacteriophages and RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes.  Early life  Paul Turner was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1966 to Eugene Turner, a Presbytarian minister, and Sylvia Turner, a public schoolteacher. Turner grew up outside of Syracuse, New York, where he spent his childhood among forests and lakes, observing animals in their natural habitats. Although he entered college at the University of Rochester intending to become an engineer, Turner was encouraged by professors like John Jaenike and Andrew Dobson to pursue graduate work in biology. Despite graduating with a B.A. in Biology in 1988, Turner was still unsure about entering graduate school. At the time, no African American had yet earned a PhD in evolutionary biology. He therefore took a four-month internship at a National Audubon Society wildlife sanctuary in Monson, Maine after graduating. During the internship, Turner convinced himself to apply to graduate programs.  Scientific career  Turner began his graduate studies in the program of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine in 1989, working with Richard E. Lenski as his PhD advisor. When Lenski‚Äôs research group transferred to Michigan State University in 1991, Turner moved with the group and completed his PhD in Zoology (with a certificate in Ecology and Evolution) there in 1995. In doing so, Turner became only the fifth African American to receive a PhD in evolutionary biology. During his time in Lenski‚Äôs group, Turner studied bacterial systems to address fundamental questions at the interface of ecology and evolution, such as the trade-off between horizontal and vertical transmission in parasites. Following his graduate studies, Turner completed postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Valencia, and the National Institutes of Health. In 2001, he was appointed as an assistant professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University. He was promoted to associate professor in 2006 and full professor in 2011. Turner has co-authored over 100 publications that have together been cited over 4,000 times. Although Turner is known for his foundational work in viral evolution, he has recently begun to apply his insights towards advancing the development of phage therapy against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

Hyper-IL-6 is a fusion protein of the four- helical cytokine Interleukin-6 and the soluble Interleukin-6 receptor which are covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker. Interleukin-6 on target cells binds to a membrane bound Interleukin-6 receptor. The complex of Interleukin-6 and the Interleukin-6 receptor associate with a second receptor protein called gp130, which dimerises and initiates intracellular signal transduction. Gp130 is expressed on all cells of the human body whereas the Interleukin-6 receptor is only found on few cells such as hepatocytes and some leukocytes. Neither Interleukin-6 nor the Interleukin-6 receptor have a measurable affinity for gp130. Therefore, cells, which only express gp130 but no Interleukin-6 receptor are not responsive to Interleukin-6. It was found, however, that the membrane-bound Interleukin-6 receptor can be cleaved from the cell membrane generating a soluble Interleukin-6 receptor. The soluble Interleukin-6 receptor can bind the ligand Interleukin-6 with similar affinity as the membrane-bound Interleukin-6 receptor and the complex of Interleukin-6 and the soluble Interleukin-6 receptor can bind to gp130 on cells, which only express gp130 but no Interleukin-6 receptor. The mode of signaling via the soluble Interleukin-6 receptor has been named Interleukin-6 trans-signaling whereas Interleukin-6 signaling via the membrane-bound Interleukin-6 receptor is referred to as Interleukin-6 classic signaling. Therefore, the generation of the soluble Interleukin-6 receptor enables cells to respond to Interleukin-6, which in the absence of soluble Interleukin-6 receptor would be completely unresponsive to the cytokine.  Molecular construction of Hyper- IL-6  In order to generate a molecular tool to discriminate between Interleukin-6 classic signaling and Interleukin-6 trans-signaling, a cDNA coding for human Interleukin-6 and a cDNA coding for the human soluble Interleukin-6 receptor were connected by a cDNA coding for a 13 amino acids long linker, which was long enough to bridge the 40 √Ö distance between the COOH terminus of the soluble Interleukin-6 receptor and the NH2 terminus of human Interleukin-6. The generated cDNA was expressed in yeast cells and in mammalian cells and it was shown that. thumb  Use of Hyper-IL-6 to analyse IL-6 signaling  Hyper-IL-6 has been used to test which cells depend on Interleukin-6 trans-signaling in their response to the cytokine Interleukin-6. To this end, cells were treated with Interleukin-6 and alternatively with Hyper-IL-6. Cells, which respond to Interleukin-6 alone do express an Interleukin-6 receptor whereas cells, which only respond to Hyper-IL-6 but not to Interleukin-6 alone depend in their response to the cytokine on Interleukin-6 trans-signaling. It turned out that hematopoietic stem cells, neural cells, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells are typical target cells of Interleukin-6 trans-signaling.  The concept of Interleukin-6 trans- signaling The Hyper-IL-6 protein has also been used to explore the physiologic role of Interleukin-6 trans-signaling in vivo. It turned out that this signaling mode was involved in many types of inflammation and cancer. Hyper-IL-6 has helped to establish the concept of Interleukin-6 trans- signaling. Interleukin-6 trans-signaling mediates the pro-inflammatory activities of Interleukin-6 whereas Interleukin-6 classic signaling governs the protective and regenerative Interleukin-6 activities.

History Date of foundation ‚Äì November 17, 1917 ‚Äì the day General Alekseev visited Novocherkassk Infirmary No. 2 on Barochnaya Street, after which an Officer Company was organized from the first volunteers. With the beginning of the First Kuban campaign in the village of Olginskaya, the Volunteer Army was reorganized by converting small units into larger units. On February 25, 1918, the regiment was formed from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Officer Battalions, the Shock Division of the Caucasian Cavalry Division, part of the 3rd Kiev School of Warrant Officers, the Rostov Officer and the Sea Company, as the Combined Officer Regiment, who later received a personal patronage of his first commander, General Markov. Initially, it consisted of 4 companies and a communications team and bombers with 13 machine guns. In mid-March 1918, the Special Junker Battalion (5th and 6th companies) was included in the regiment as the second battalion. Already during the Ice Campaign, the Combined Officer Regiment began to be called the Officer Regiment; from mid-March 1918, it was part of the 1st Infantry Brigade under the command of General Markov. On June 9, 1918, it was renamed the 1st Officer Regiment. On June 25, 1918, at the very beginning of the Second Kuban campaign, General Markov was killed in a battle near Shablievka station, who commanded the 1st Infantry Division of the Volunteer Army by that time. The departing red armored train fired the last shots, and a fragment of the head of the general who was watching the battle progress from the stack was demolished by a fragment of one of the shells. Now in this already city ‚Äì Salsk ‚Äì a monument has been erected to General Markov. On black, Markov epaulets, henceforth was the monogram of General Markov: \\"Markov\\" and the monogram ‚Äì \\"General Markov\\" for the 1st Company of the Regiment ‚Äì \\"the Company of General Markov\\". At the end of the Second Kuban campaign, almost without respite, the regiment was transferred to the Coal Basin, where, together with other parts of the Volunteer Army, it waged heavy battles against the Makhnovists and Red Army soldiers. Later, regiment participated in a Moscow campaign. 1st Officer General Markov Regiment at the parade in Yekaterinodar, 1918 Flag of the Markovites By order of July 25, 1919, the formation of the 2nd Officer General Markov Regiment began. It was finally formed on August 27, 1919 in Kharkov on the basis of the 4th and Reserve Battalions and officer personnel of the 7th Company of the Markov Regiment. On October 16, 1919, the 3rd Officer General Markov Regiment was formed. Its formation was carried out since September and took place in Kharkov on the basis of the 9th Officer Company of the 1st Regiment. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the South of Russia of October 27, 1919, the 1st Infantry Division, which included all three Markov regiments, was divided into Kornilov Shock and Officer General Markov Infantry Divisions. In addition to the Markov regiments, the Artillery General Markov Brigade formed on October 28, 1919 on the basis of the 1st Artillery Brigade, as well as the 1st Separate Engineering General Markov Company, became part of the formed division. In the spring and autumn of 1919, reserve battalions of the Markov division were created ‚Äì one for the entire division and one for each regiment, whose personnel were used to replenish combat units. The battalions were disbanded in early 1920. In this composition, the division was part of the 1st Army Corps. On December 31, 1919, during the retreat of the Armed Forces of the South of Russia, the Markov Division in the Donbass was encircled in the village of Alekseevo-Leonovo and lost two-thirds of the personnel. After the restoration of its strength, in January 1920, it successfully held the defense south of Rostov-on-Don. But during the retreat of Denikin's army deep into the Kuban, he was defeated again on February 29 in the battle near the village of Olginskaya, after which on March 1 the division was reorganized into the Officer General Markov regiment. Colonel Alexander Bleish was appointed commander. The artillery brigade was reduced to the Separate Artillery General Markov Division, the horse-drawn hundreds ‚Äì to the Horse Division. Markovites were assigned to Novorossiysk. Poured replenishment allowed the deployment of the Markov division again as part of 3 regiments and an artillery brigade. The total composition of the division reached almost 3800 people ‚Äì of which 906 officers. At the same time, the 1st Officer General Markov Regiment consisted of 284 officers with 549 soldiers ‚Äì this regiment was the largest in the division. After the evacuation of Markov units from Novorossiysk to Crimea, on March 26, 1920, the division was restored. In Crimea, it became part of the formed 1st Army Corps. The division was replenished to almost 4,5 thousand people, and the 1st Regiment consisted of 1043 people (375 of which were officers) with 27 machine guns. On May 11, 1920, after the renaming of the Armed Forces of the South of Russia by General Peter Wrangel to the Russian Army, the Officer General Markov Division was renamed the General Markov Infantry Division (in accordance with this renaming, the regiments of the division were also called \\"infantry\\"). In the summer of 1920, reserve battalions of regiments and divisions were re-created as part of the division (the latter was intended for deployment in the 4th Regiment, the formation of which was begun in October). As part of the 1st Army Corps, the Markov Division participated in battles in Northern Tavria and the Zadniprovsky operation. In the last battle, the Markovites, not receiving the support of the Drozdovites, wavered and began to retreat. Colonel Tretyakov shot himself. Markovites with difficulty were able to break into the Crimea. The brigade from the 1st and 3rd Markov Infantry Regiments, led by Colonel Pyotr Sagaidachny, participated in the last battles of the Russian Army of General Wrangel in Crimea in November 1920. The regiment guarded the Chongar Isthmus. The order to retreat was not delivered to them on time. All White Guard units then left, even the armored train. The colonel realized that it was necessary to make a quick decision, and, subjugating the 3rd regiment, hurriedly led the brigade south. Soon the Cossack rode up with a report that we should retreat ‚Äì with a delay of 3 hours. But the Markovites almost caught up with their leaving column. In parallel to them was the numerous Red Cavalry. Ahead from the Kurman-Kemelchi station, firing off, white armored trains left and the Markovites turned out to be surrounded. Closing in the square they volleys and machine guns did not allow the red cavalry to cut into their ranks. The early twilight came and allowed them to retreat. In early November 1920, the division, along with other parts of the Russian army, was evacuated from Crimea. On November 27 in Gallipoli, the remainder of the division was reduced to the Markov Regiment and the Markov Artillery Division. For the ranks of the regiment in exile, a breastplate was installed in the form of a black Maltese cross with a white narrow border, in the center ‚Äì a black rectangle with diagonally intersecting lines, surrounded by a silver crown of thorns; at the ends of the cross dates: \\"12\\", \\"Feb\\", \\"19\\", \\"18\\".

The legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on June 8, 2020. The legislation aims to combat police misconduct, excessive force, and racial bias in policing. The bill passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on a mostly party-line vote of 236-181, but is not expected to advance in the Republican- controlled Senate.House Passes George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, Reuters (June 25, 2020).Catie Edmondson, House Passes Sweeping Policing Bill Targeting Racial Bias and Use of Force, New York Times (June 25, 2020). President Donald Trump opposes the legislation. Background The drafting of the legislation was preceded by a series of killings of Black Americans by white police officers and civilians in 2020, including George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, which resulted in a protest movement. However, the proposed legislation contains some provisions that civil rights advocates have long sought. The bill is named in Floyd's honor.Clare Foran, Haley Byrd & Manu Raju, House approves police reform bill named in honor of George Floyd, CNN (June 25, 2020). Provisions The legislation has been described as \\"sweeping\\". It would: * Grant power to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to issue subpoenas to police departments as part of \\"pattern or practice\\" investigations into whether there has been a \\"pattern and practice\\" of bias or misconduct by the department * Provide grants to state attorneys general to \\"create an independent process to investigate misconduct or excessive use of force\\" by police forces * Establish a federal registry of police misconduct complaints and disciplinary actions * Enhance accountability for police officers who commit misconduct, by restricting the application of the qualified immunity doctrine for local and state officers, and by changing the mens rea (intent) element of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 242 (the federal criminal offense of \\"deprivation of rights under color of law,\\" which has been used to prosecute police for misconduct) from \\"willfully\\" to \\"knowingly or with reckless disregard\\"Federal Police Oversight: Criminal Civil Rights Violations Under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 242, Congressional Research Service (June 15, 2020), pp. 1-2, 4. * Require federal uniformed police officers to have body-worn cameras * Require marked federal police vehicles to be equipped with dashboard cameras. * Require state and local law enforcement agencies that receive federal funding to \\"ensure\\" the use of body-worn and dashboard cameras. * Restrict the transfer of military equipment to police (see 1033 program, militarization of police) * Require state and local law enforcement agencies that receive federal funding to adopt anti-discrimination policies and training programs, including those targeted at fighting racial profiling * Prohibit federal police officers from using chokeholds or other carotid holds (which led to the deaths of George Floyd and Eric Garner), and require state and local law enforcement agencies that receive federal funding to adopt the same prohibition * Prohibit the issuance of no-knock warrants (warrants that allow police to conduct a raid without knocking or announcing themselves) in federal drug investigations, and provide incentives to the states to enact a similar prohibition. * Change the threshold for the permissible use of force by federal law enforcement officers from \\"reasonableness\\" to only when \\"necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.\\" * Mandate that federal officers use deadly force only as a last resort and that de-escalation be attempted, and condition federal funding to state and local law enforcement agencies on the adoption of the same policy. Legislative history=Drafting and introduction In the House of Representatives, the legislation has been principally drafted by Representative Karen Bass of California (who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus) and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York (who chairs the House Judiciary Committee); in the Senate, the legislation has been drafted by Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the Senate's two black Democrats. The legislation was introduced in the House as H.B. 7120 on June 8, 2020, by Bass, with 165 co-sponsors, all Democrats. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, and additionally to the House Armed Services Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee, for consideration of provisions falling within those committees' jurisdiction. The legislation was introduced in the Senate on the same day as S. 3912, by Booker, with 35 cosponsors. It was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Committee hearings At a June 10 hearing on police issues in the House Judiciary Committee, George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, testified in favor of police reforms. Also testifying were the Floyd family's attorney Benjamin Crump (invited by the Democrats) and Angela Underwood Jacobs (invited by the Republican, the brother of Federal Protective Service officer David \\"Patrick\\" Underwood, who was killed in the line of duty. Committee Republicans invited conservative Fox News commentator and ex-Secret Service agent Dan Bongino, who did not mention police brutality at the hearing and instead focused on dangers faced by police. Committee Republicans also called Darrell C. Scott, a Trump surrogate, to testify. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on June 16, members heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Vanita Gupta of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; attorney S. Lee Merritt, who represents the family of Ahmaud Arbery; St. Paul, Minnesota Mayor Melvin Carter; Houston Police Department chief Art Acevedo; and Fraternal Order of Police national president Patrick Yoes. Gupta, who served as head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration, testified in favor of police reforms and criticized the Trump Justice Department, while Yoes testified against restricting qualified immunity for police. Support and opposition The legislation is endorsed by more than 100 civil rights groups, including the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NAACP and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Urban League, Amnesty International, and National Action Network. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the legislation for taking \\"significant steps to protect people and ensure accountability against police violence\\" but expressed opposition to providing \\"hundreds of millions more to law enforcement\\" and called for more sweeping changes to \\"the role of police in our society fundamentally.\\" Police unions and other organizations representing police oppose the bill. Police organizations are influential in Congress, exerting influence through campaign contributions, endorsements, and lobbying and advocacy efforts, and historically have been successfully in stymieing reform legislation.Luke Broadwater & Catie Edmondson, Police Groups Wield Strong Influence in Congress, Resisting the Strictest Reforms, New York Times (June 25, 2020). President Donald Trump opposes the bill, issuing a formal pledge to veto the legislation if it passed Congress and contending that the bill is \\"overbroad\\" and would \\"weaken the ability of law enforcement agencies to reduce crime.\\" Trump specifically opposed proposals to restrict qualified immunity. House passage House members after passage of the bill on June 25, 2020 On June 17, 2020, after a nearly 12-hour debate, the House Judiciary Committee advanced the bill to the House floor on a party-line vote (with all Democrats voting yes and all Republicans voting no).Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle, Kyle Cheney & John Bresnahan, House Judiciary panel advances police reform bill after emotional debate, Politico (June 17, 2020).

The legislation's key sponsors sought to garner support for the bill from moderate Republicans, but ultimately only three House Republicans (all moderates) joined all House Democrats in voting to pass the bill: Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Will Hurd of Texas (the sole black Republican U.S. Representative). The bill is not expected to advance in the Republican- controlled Senate.

Democrats and civil rights organizations oppose the Senate Republican proposal as too weak; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker (the sponsors of the Senate version of the Justice in Policing Act), called the Republican bill \\"not salvageable\\" and \\"so threadbare and lacking in substance that it does not even provide a proper baseline for negotiations.\\" On June 24, 2020, the Senate Republican proposal failed in a procedural vote of 55‚Äì45, on a mostly-party line vote, failing to obtain the 60 votes needed to advance to a floor debate.Joan E.

The organization works to further Arabic typography and design research by creating a platform for a network of designers from different backgrounds and a knowledge center for Arabic typography. The foundation also publishes books on related topics through Khatt Books.  Name  The word \\"khatt\\" () means \\"line\\" in Arabic, and it is also used to refer to Arabic calligraphy.  Organization  The foundation started with the goal of \\"modernising the image of Arabic design by making it contemporary and innovative, particularly in the field of bilingual typography,\\" referring to typography that works with both Arabic and Latin scripts together. One of the initiatives to this end is \\"Typographic Matchmaking\\", which pairs designers of different backgrounds together. The first of these matches, between the Slovakian typographer Peter Bilak and Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis, led to the creation of the TPTQ Arabic type foundry specializing in unified Arabic-Latin fonts. One of the products of this initiative was the multiscript Qandus typeface for Latin, Arabic, and Neo-Tifinagh scripts, based on the calligraphy of Muhammad Bin Al-Qasim al-Qundusi. In 2007, the Khatt Foundation partnered with Mediamatic to creat the El Hema project, an imagined \\"Arabic HEMA\\" department store. Its other activities include coordinating and sponsoring projects, organizing conferences and forums, and publishing books and content on Arabic typography and design.

She is the founding pastor of New Roots African Methodist Episcopal Church in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Prior to her ordination in the AME Church, she was the director of Project HIP-HOP, a youth organization that uses arts as a way to communicate and educate on social justice topics. Early Years White- Hammond is the daughter of Reverends Ray Hammond and Gloria White-Hammond, both medical doctors and ordained ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her parents married in 1973. She is the oldest of two children; her sister is Adiya White-Hammond. White-Hammond grew up in the Grove Hall neighborhood of Dorchester, in Boston, Massachusetts. She became politically aware at a young age. As a teen, she boycotted Coke in support of the anti- apartheid movement in South Africa. She attended the Winsor School, a private college preparatory school in Boston's Fenway, and then Stanford University, where she studied human rights law and international relations. Activism and ministry In 2005, White-Hammond became the director of Project HipHop, a community nonprofit that focuses on arts programming for youth of color in Boston. As a teen, White-Hammond had been a youth member of the organization, which was originally established to educate young people about the history of the civil rights movement. As director, she helped shift the organization to focus on \\"cultural organizing\\", using hip-hop culture and arts to encourage youth to speak our on social justice issues. In eleven years with the organization, White-Hammond saw first-hand the challenges faced by inner city youth, as two of her students were shot and killed, and another three injured. That same year, in 2005, she travelled with the youth of Bethel AME Church to New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The service trip served as a catalyst for White-Hammond to begin making connections between environmental concerns and racial and economic justice. She became active in local politics, serving as in 2006 as a ward captain for Deval Patrick's re- election campaign for governor. In 2014, she decided to pursue ordination, and began studying at Boston University School of Theology, where she completed a Master of Divinity degree in 2017. While a student, she served as the Minister for Ecological Justice at Bethel AME Church. She was ordained in the African Episcopal Methodist Church prior to her graduation, in April 2016. Since attending seminary, she has become a recognized leader on issues related to environmentalism and racial justice. She serves as a Fellow of the Green Justice Coalition, working on environmental activism in communities of color. She was appointed to Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy's Racial Justice and Equity Council in 2016. She lobbied against a natural gas pipeline that was scheduled to be placed in the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, and was arrested in a demonstration against the pipeline in 2017, along with 22 other activists, including Karenna Gore, the daughter of former Vice President Al Gore. In January 2017, White-Hammond served as the Master of Ceremonies for Boston's Women's March, which was estimated to be the largest protest ever held on Boston Common. That same year, she was the master of ceremonies for the Boston People's Climate Mobilization. Following her father's example, White-Hammond founded New Roots AME Church in Dorchester, in 2018, where she serves as the pastor. In June 2020, White-Hammond preached at a clergy-organized memorial service held at Bethel AME Church, remembering the lives of three African-Americans who had been killed in spring 2020: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. The memorial was held following a symbolic funeral procession through the streets of Boston.

She campaigned through social media to uplift the overall image of Pakistan and portrayed it as a country that needed to be viewed differently. Liberal media and Pakistani feminists contested her more positive take on the country. In June 2020, Ritchie made #MeToo allegations of sexual misconduct against politicians, with the majority of the women's movement and human rights advocates remaining silent regarding her case.  Personal background  Ritchie has been described as a global citizen and has written on a variety of topics including interfaith harmony, women and children's rights, tourism, and advocacy for strong Pakistan‚ÄìUnited States relations.Geo: March 15th, 2017: For global citizen Cynthia Pakistan is an adventurer's heavenMvslim: Uncovering Pakistan's hidden jewels, Cynthia Ritchie's journeyMvslim: February 11th, 2016: Attacking Islam, Let us reflect on our American valuesTribune: That little girlTribune: Light a candle to curse the darknessTribune: Reminder Pakistan's efforts in the war on terror Ritchie has a large social media following. She graduated from Louisiana State University and took additional training at the University of Houston's School of Law, Pepperdine University, and George Washington University in the faculties of mass communications, criminal justice, conflict resolution, clinical and behavioral psychology, and strategic public relations. In 2017, Ritchie also acted in the docudrama, Angels Within.Los Angeles Times: October 12th, 2017: Angels Within Review  In Pakistan  In July 2020, the Interior Ministry of Pakistan officially admitted before Islamabad High court that Ritchie was allowed to work and given clearances and travel facilitation on film projects by Pakistan's Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Inter-Services Public Relations. Ritchie's first known visit to Pakistan was in 2010, after acquiring a visit visa from Pakistan's Houston consulate through Federal Minister for Narcotics Control Azam Khan Swati. Swati and other Houston-based Pakistani expats reportedly helped Ritchie via socializing with Pakistan's elite Political contacts. According to Baqir Sajjad Syed, Ritchie worked in Pakistan for the Omair-Sana Foundation and Humanity Hope. The two institutions are owned or managed by American-based Pakistani doctors. Ritchie also worked to improve communications in Pakistan's health sector. In 2013, Ritchie was described by Michael Kugelman from the Woodrow Wilson Institute in Washington, DC, as one of \\"[t]en Americans doing great things for Pakistan\\". From about 2015 onwards, Ritchie began to more actively promote tourism and people-to-people relations over broadcast and social media. Around 2016‚Äì2020, Ritchie began to research and analyse the Afghan-Pakistan Tribal region, fifth-generation warfare, Kashmir conflicts, and Pakistan‚ÄìIndia relations. In her media engagements, Ritchie claimed that she did not choose Pakistan as an interest; Pakistanis chose her to reshape perceptions about Pakistan among the international community. She has been called \\"The American Batting For Pakistan\\". In June of 2020, one of her critics wrote Ritchie \\"... has become a celebrity in Pakistan over the last few years, and a star during the last week or so. And why wouldn‚Äôt she? She is tall, pretty, and single, and a stunningly brilliant communicator. Her utterances have sensationalized the politics of Pakistan....\\"  Harassment and court battles  In June 2020, Ritchie accused the top leadership of Pakistan People's Party (PPP) of sexual misconduct in 2011 over social media. The claim was contested by respective political dispensation and leaders:Deutsch Weld: J7ne 18th, 2020: Cynthia Ritchie on Pakistan rape allegations: 'I hope my experience helps other victims' when she was asked why she had not reported the rape incident earlier, she replied that several days after the event she reported the rape and theft of her laptop to a US embassy official who worked in the political sector. Months later, Ritchie also reported the theft of her identity to federal authorities in Washington, DC, in 2012, but the \\"[US] Embassy's response and the USG's response was inadequate\\" and \\"besides, who in the [then] PPP administration would help me?\\"Tribune: June 05, 2020: Cynthia Ritchie claims Rehman Malik raped her in 2011 She stated she was in the wrong place at the wrong time and, as a consequence, knew too much about US‚ÄìPakistan relations, especially surrounding events leading to May 1, 2011, and became a political liability, which would explain the lack of adequate assistance for an American in distress. Ritchie worked for the health ministry, which collected the samples from Abbottabad. She started coming to the region two years prior to the Osama bin Laden raid, and says her presence in the Federal health ministry at the time was \\"a coincidence\\". On August 5, 2020, a court dismissed Ritchie's rape case against Senator Rehman Malik and also dismissed Malik's defamation case against her. Ritchie stated she was prepared to take her case to Pakistan's Supreme Court if needed. She has also reached out to Congressional representatives regarding the court cases. A few weeks later, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued notices in a petition of Ritchie seeking registration of a rape case against Malik. In Ritchie's petition, her counsel Imran Feroze stated that \\"the petition was dismissed by the additional district and sessions (ADS) judge illegally and unlawfully\\". On the September 1, 2020, the Islamabad High Court accepted Ritchie's petition against Malik and sent her case back to the lower court for further hearing. A few days after the Islamabad High Court rejected the lower court's dismissal of the rape case against Rehman Malik, the Ministry of Interior denied Ritchie's visa extension without and explanation and was unable to clarify their stance regarding visa policies or laws before the Chief Justice in the IHC. However, \\"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) stopped US blogger Cynthia Dawn Ritchie‚Äôs deportation... days after the interior ministry had declined to extend her visa and asked her to leave the country within 15 days.\\" Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Rehman Malik moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday, September 11, 2020, to stop hearing of the petition of American blogger for registration of a case against him by the additional district and sessions judge. Rehman Malik also filed a separate petition in the Supreme Court against Ritchie. On the same day, Ritchie‚Äôs lawyer Saiful Muluk filed his power of attorney in the apex court to represent her. Speaking on the occasion, Ritchie said that she had evidence against Rehman Malik. She added that she had lodged a complaint with the US embassy on the day of the incident. She said that American FBI was also informed about Malik. Responding to a question, Ritchie said that she had not worked as an employee or consultant ‚Äì paid or otherwise ‚Äì with any Pakistani Government organisation, including the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), but that she had only received her clearances and permissions to travel and conduct film work in remote and sensitive locations. About the motorway gang rape incident, she said impartial investigations must take place, rapists should be punished to the fullest extent of the law, and the law-enforcement agencies must work together to ensure vulnerable populations' safety. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday, 14th September disposed of an application filed by former interior minister Rehman Malik to stop the proceedings on US blogger Cynthia Dawn Ritchie‚Äôs plea in the subordinate court. The IHC noted that the subordinate court would decide the case without being impressed by the high court‚Äôs observation. The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday, 29 September 2020, issued notices to the advocate general (AG) and prosecutor general (PG) of Islamabad in former Interior Minister Rehman Malik's case against American citizen. A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Mushir Alam and comprised Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, heard the case. During the course of proceedings, Advocate Sardar Latif Khosa, counsel for Rehman Malik, pleaded the court to quash the Islamabad High court's decision regarding the investigation and registration of the first information report (FIR) into Rehman Malik. If an FIR was registered on such mere allegations, no one's honor would be protected, he added. Justice Qazi Amin asked if a woman accused someone, even if they were wrong, under what law it could be stopped? The court issued notices and adjourned the hearing of the case till Wednesday. https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/supreme-court- issues-notices-to-ag-pg-islama-1041824.html  Twitter controversies  Ritchie made contested #MeToo allegations of sexual misconduct against politicians, such as former Interior Minister Rehman Malik, one ex-president, two ex-prime ministers, including one female former Prime Minister and two ex- cabinet ministers. But many questioned why more women's liberal rights activists weren't supportive of an impartial investigation, due to some rights activists remaining silent or actively engaging in \\"victim blaming\\"- reflecting what was described, by many, as hypocrisy for Pakistani #MeToo movement activists. Ritchie's sympathisers ‚Äì who mostly belong to right-wing groups ‚Äì called the activists \\"hypocrites\\" for not expressing \\"unequivocal support\\" for her. Some Aurat (women's rights) marchers even accused Ritchie of \\"white privilege\\". The Pakistan People's Party did not come to Ritchie's assistance and its chairman did not \\"take any notice nor rush to stand by [her] for a greater cause... instead moving the Ministry of Interior to investigate her - the first incident for Ritchie in over 10+ years in the country.\\" The PPP lodged complaints of false allegations against Ritchie, who countered with more accusations through her Twitter handle. A social media war broke out and the PPP accused Ritchie of online defamation of a deceased Prime Minister. Both the Pakistan Telecom Authority and Federal Investigative Agency, cybercrime division, said Ritchie committed no criminal offence and would not pursue any case against her.Dawn: June 14th, 2020: Malik Assad: PTA also can‚Äôt proceed against US blogger, court told The PPP then issued a series of First Information Reports (FIRs) against Ritchie and approached the Islamabad High Court to have her deported due to her political statements on Twitter. The High Court stated there was no Pakistani law forbidding foreigners from making political statements and ordered the Ministry of Interior (MoI) to let the law take its course and handle the matter itself.The News of Islamabad: July 10th, 2020: IHC asks interior ministry to take a decision on Cynthia Ritchie deportation petition After seeming to confuse work and visa policies, the Ministry of Interior acknowledged that it violated its own visa policy, but gave the blogger a clean chit on July 17, 2020.

For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization. * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars. * Liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel). * Releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post-incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1987: * 1987 On January 30, natural gas leaking from a pipeline under repair in Colorado Springs, Colorado, ignited, sending flames 45 feet into the air, and injuring four people. * 1987 A petroleum pipeline ruptured and burned, near Corsicana, Texas on March 12, forcing the closure of an Interstate highway, and cause some evacuations. * 1987 A work crew burning the remains of a house near Ladysmith, Virginia ruptured a nearby petroleum products pipeline with a bulldozer on March 26, igniting diesel fuel from the line. 2 of the workers were injured. * 1987 On April 4, an LPG pipeline exploded at a Terminal in Iowa City, Iowa. Due to the fire spreading to a pipeline for nearby underground gas storage, residents within a 2 1/2 mile radius of the Terminal were evacuated for a time. The fire burned until April 20. The cause was an ERW seam failure in a pipeline. During a hydrostatic test of that pipeline, 20 more pipeline segment seams failed. * 1987 In Odessa, Texas, on April 18, a crude oil pipeline burst into flames, destroying nine mobile homes and two cars. The fire started under a mobile home on Andrews Highway. The Texas Railroad Commission stated that gases within the crude corroded and weakened the 10-inch 60-year-old pipe. When the line split, it spewed oil into the fire, fueling the blaze and causing dense black smoke that choked firefighters and bystanders. * 1987 A Mobil pipeline ruptured near Lebec, California on June 8, spilling about 2,500 barrels of crude oil. The failure was from external corrosion of the pipeline. * 1987 On June 11, a \\"rock ripper\\" at a construction site punctured a 32-inch Colonial Pipeline petroleum products pipeline in Centreville, Virginia. Gasoline sprayed from the rupture, but there was no fire. More than of gasoline were released. Thirteen emergency response personnel suffered from exposure to the gasoline fumes. * 1987 An Amoco pipeline failed in Florence, Michigan on June 11, spilling 24,000 barrels of petroleum. * 1987 On June 12, a petroleum products pipeline ruptured near Harwood, North Dakota. 289 barrels of fuel oil were spilled. There were no injuries. Investigation showed this pipeline failed at a low frequency Electric Resistance Welding (ERW) seam. Further testing after this accident lead to 5 other LF-ERW failures along this pipeline in Minnesota and North Dakota. * 1987 Construction equipment hit a LPG/NGL pipeline near Rochester, Iowa on June 26, killing one person, and injuring 2 others. * 1987 On July 3, a Yellowstone Pipeline Company line failed from an unspecified flaw in the pipe, in Montana. About 162,000 gallons of petroleum product were lost. * 1987 On July 24, a fishing vessel, working in shallow waters off of Empire, Louisiana, the Fishing vessel Sea Chief, struck and ruptured an 8\\" natural gas liquids pipeline operating at 480 psi. The resulting explosion killed two crew members. Divers investigating found that the pipe, installed in 1968, was covered with only 6\\" of soft mud, having lost its original cover of sediments. * 1987 On July 23, a construction crew working on an Interstate 90 project east of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho struck the 10-inch diameter Yellowstone Pipeline, causing a leak that sprayed out over 27,000 gallons of gasoline. The pipeline was supposed to have 30 inches of soil cover, but had only 2 inches of cover. There was no fire. * 1987 On August 5, gas leak on a busy road in Wilmington, North Carolina suddenly ignited, while gas company workers were trying to plug that leak, burning them and firefighters on standby. 19 people were burned, with a Fire Department Assistant Chief later dying from the burns he received. * 1987 On September 8, 3 pipeline workers were hurt, when a butane pipeline they were working on exploded near Kemah, Texas. * 1987 4 pipeline workers were hurt while working on a Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline in Martin, Kentucky on October 19. A rubber seal inside a steel collar failed, allowing 2 sections of pipeline to separate. There was no fire.

It advances a number of theses on the impact of economic factors on the decline of slavery, specifically the Atlantic slave trade and slavery in the British Empire, from the second half of the 18th century. It also makes criticisms of the historiography of the British Empire of the period: in particular on the use of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 as a sort of moral pivot; but also directed against a historical school that saw the imperial constitutional history as a constant advance through legislation. It uses polemical asides for some personal attacks, notably on the Oxford historian Reginald Coupland. Seymour Drescher, a prominent critic among historians of some of the theses put forward in Capitalism and Slavery by Williams, wrote in 1987: > If one criterion of a classic is its ability to reorient our most basic way > of viewing an object or a concept, Eric Williams's study supremely passes > that test. The applicability of the economic arguments, and specially in the form of so- called Ragatz‚ÄìWilliams decline theory, is a contentious matter to this day for historians, when it is used for the period around the American Revolutionary War. On the other hand detailed economic investigations of the effects of slavery on the British economy, in particular, the aftermath of abolition, and the commercial hinterland of the Atlantic trade, are a thriving research area. The historiography of the British Empire is still widely contested. Kenneth Morgan writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography evaluates Capitalism and Slavery as \\"perhaps the most influential book written in the twentieth century on the history of slavery\\". Williams as an Oxford undergraduate In 1931 Williams came to the University of Oxford from Trinidad on an Island Scholarship. He joined St Catherine's Society, not then a college (until that year the Delegacy for Non-Collegiate Students). He obtained a first-class degree in Modern History, but found social life largely unfriendly. He made a friend of a Thai student, interacted with his tutors, and attended the Indian Majlis, a student club. The Economic Aspect of the Abolition of the West Indian Slave Trade and Slavery Williams wrote his Oxford D.Phil. dissertation under Vincent Harlow, on a topic suggested by C. L. R. James. The tone of the dissertation is judged \\"deferential\\", in comparison with the 1944 published version. One of the D.Phil. examiners was Reginald Coupland, from 1920 second holder of the Beit Chair at Oxford for \\"colonial history\\", founded in 1905. An emphasis on constitutional history led at Oxford, as Behm puts it, to \\"enthusiasm for social and moral reform [...] in an atmosphere already permeated by 'constitutional progress' as shorthand for centuries of world-historical advance\\". Alfred Beit, the founder, was a friend of Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner, and the Chair came under the influence of the Round Table movement that forwarded Milner's ideas, and to which Coupland belonged. In his later work British Historians and the West Indies (1966), Williams attacked the generality of Oxford historians who had dealt with the topic. He excepted Sydney Olivier. Williams had been made aware of the potential importance of Coupland to his academic career by Joseph Oliver Cutteridge, the ex-British Army officer who was director of education in Trinidad and Tobago. This was at the point in 1936 when Williams was given funding for his doctoral work; Cutteridge had contacted Coupland on his behalf, to use influence with Claud Hollis, the Governor. Cutteridge had then advised \\"caution\\". The original dissertation was published in 2014. Its argument has the same basic structure of a \\"decline\\" thesis, and the negation of good intentions of abolitionists as a historical factor. Ryden identifies the three faces of decline in the first half of the 19th century as: \\"falling sugar planting profits\\"; \\"decline of the relative importance of the West Indian trade\\" in the British economy; and \\"a rising anti-mercantilist tide\\".David Beck Ryden, Eric Williams' Three Faces of West India Decline, Review (Fernand Braudel Center) Vol. 35, No. 2 (2012), pp. 117‚Äì133, at p. 120. Published by: Research Foundation of State University of New York for and on behalf of the Fernand Braudel Center. Howard University, and publication Williams left the United Kingdom for the United States in 1939. After a period of unsuccessful job applications, he had been appointed assistant professor at Howard University in Washington D.C. A close colleague there, who wrote a foreword to Williams's The Negro in the Caribbean (1942), was Alain LeRoy Locke. Others on the faculty were Ralph Bunche, E. Franklin Frazier, and Charles S. Johnson. Williams was brought to Howard by Locke, supported by Bunche and Abram Lincoln Harris, and took on a teaching load in the Political Science department. An attempt by Williams to have his dissertation published in the United Kingdom through Fredric Warburg failed: the undermining of the humanitarian motivation for the Abolition Act 1833 was found unacceptable, culturally speaking. Publication of Capitalism and Slavery happened finally in the United States, in 1944. It appeared in a British edition in 1964, with an introduction by Denis William Brogan, summarising Williams's thesis in a phrase on abolition as a cutting of losses, and illustration of the workings of self-interest. Brogan had reviewed Capitalism and Slavery in the Times Literary Supplement, and accepted its general argument on the predominance of economic forces. Arguments and sources of Capitalism and Slavery Capitalism and Slavery covers the economic history of sugar and slavery into the 19th century and discusses the decline of Caribbean sugar plantations from 1823 until the emancipation of the slaves in the 1830s. It also notes the British government's use of the equalisation of the sugar duties Acts in the 1840s, to reduce protectionism for sugar from the British West Indian colonies, and promote free trade in sugar from Cuba and Brazil, where it was cheaper.Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964). The work relied on economic reasoning going back to Lowell Joseph Ragatz, to whom it was dedicated. The secondary sources bibliography, after commending works by Ragatz, mentioned The Development of the British West Indies, 1700‚Äì1763 (1917) by the American historian Frank Wesley Pitman. In two 1918 reviews of Pitman's book, Hugh Edward Egerton, the first holder of the Beit Chair at Oxford, picked out the baseline 1763‚Äîwhen the Seven Years' War ended in the Peace of Paris, and Great Britain returned to France the Caribbean island Guadeloupe while keeping Canada‚Äîas (in Pitman's argument) the start of manipulation of the sugar trade and its regulation, by British producers, for profit. In other words artificial scarcity was created by the West India Interest, an example of client politics.Review by: H. E. Egerton, Reviewed Work: The Development of the British West Indies, 1700-63 by F. W. Pitman, The English Historical Review Vol. 33, No. 131 (Jul., 1918), pp. 406‚Äì408. Published by: Oxford University Press Review by: H. E. Egerton, Reviewed Work: The Development of the British West Indies, 1700-63 by F. W. Pitman, The Economic Journal Vol. 28, No. 112 (Dec., 1918), pp. 435‚Äì436, Published by: Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Economic Society DOI: 10.2307/2223336 In the American context, it had been argued by William Babcock Weeden (1834‚Äì1912), and in 1942 by Lorenzo Greene, that the slave trade was integral to the economic development of New England. Williams argued that slavery played a major role in making Britain prosperous. The high profits from slavery, he said, helped finance the Industrial Revolution. British capital was gained from unpaid work.Barbara Solow and Stanley L. Engerman, eds., British capitalism and Caribbean slavery: The legacy of Eric Williams (Cambridge University Press, 2004) The bibliography also cites The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James for its priority in giving in 1938 a statement (in English) of the major thesis of Capitalism and Slavery; and a master's dissertation from that year by Wilson Williams at Howard University. Wilson Williams and Abram Harris are taken to be the sources of the work's interest in the commercial writer Malachy Postlethwayt. The book, besides dealing with a passage of economic history, was furthermore a frontal attack on the idea that moral and humanitarian motives were key in the victory of British abolitionism. It was also a critique of the idea common in the 1930s, and particularly advocated by Reginald Coupland, that British imperialism, more broadly, was essentially propelled by benevolent impulses. The centenary celebration of the 1833 Act that took place in the United Kingdom in 1933, in Kingston upon Hull where William Wilberforce was born, was a public event in which Coupland made these ideas explicit, supported in The Times by G. M. Trevelyan. Williams made a number of pointed critical remarks in this direction, including: * \\"Professor Coupland contends that behind the legal judgement lay the moral judgement, and that the Somersett case was the beginning of the end of slavery throughout the British Empire. This is merely poetic sentimentality translated into modern history.\\" * From the \\"Conclusion\\": \\"But historians, writing a hundred years after, have no excuse for continuing to wrap the real interests in confusion.\\" Footnoted as: \\"Of this deplorable tendency Professor Coupland of Oxford University is a notable example.\\" Williams rejected moralised explanation and argued that abolition was driven by diminishing returns, after a century of sugarcane raising had exhausted the soil of the islands. Beyond this aspect of the decline thesis, he argued that the slave-based Atlantic economy of the 18th century generated new pro-free trade and anti-slavery political interests. These interacted with the rise of evangelical antislavery and with the self-emancipation of slave rebels, from the Haitian Revolution of 1792‚Äì1804 to the Jamaica Christmas Rebellion of 1831, to bring the end of slavery in the 1830s.Williams, Capitalism and Slavery. Periodisation of Capitalism and Slavery The points raised required periodisation, by calibration to a timeline. The D.Phil. dissertation limited itself to the period 1780‚Äì1833. In Chapter 4 of the book, \\"The West India Interest\\", an outline of a timeline is given, reflecting the difference of interests of planters and the sugar merchants: * 1739: Planters and merchants find their interests conflicting, on the issue of free trade with continental Europe (p. 92). * 1764: The West India Interest in its \\"heyday\\" (p. 97). * c.1780: The American Revolution disrupts the existing system of British commerce (p. 96). At this point the interests of planters and merchants had become aligned (p. 92). * 1832: The Reform Parliament at Westminster represents the Lancashire manufacturing interest, rather than the West India Interest (p. 97). Chapter 5, \\"British Industry and the Triangular Trade\\", in other words on the Atlantic slave trade as part of the triangular trade completed by sugar, begins on p. 98 with \\"Britain was accumulating great wealth from the triangular trade.\\" It ends with a few pages of overview, arguing that the economic development already visible by 1783 was outgrowing the system dubbed mercantilism. The 1807 prohibition of the international slave trade, Williams argued, prevented French expansion of sugar plantations on other islands. British investment turned to Asia, where labour was plentiful and slavery was unnecessary. Dividing up the period c.1780 to 1832, by the end of the triangular trade in 1807, Williams wrote that \\"The abolitionists for a long time eschewed and repeatedly disowned any idea of emancipation.\\"Capitalism and Slavery, p. 182 He also presented economic data to show that the triangular trade alone had generated only minor profits compared to the sugar plantations. Then from 1823 the British Caribbean sugar industry went into terminal decline, and the British parliament no longer felt they needed to protect the economic interests of the West Indian sugar planters.Eric Williams, Capitalism and Slavery (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964). Reception Beckles in 2009 wrote of \\"the fundamental academic respect that Capitalism and Slavery enjoys within the Caribbean\\", after noting the \\"persistent and penetrative criticisms\\". Supporters cited were Sydney H. H. Carrington (1937‚Äì2018), an advocate of the decline thesis as originally stated, and Gordon Kenneth Lewis (1919‚Äì1991), whose view was that \\"it is testimony to the essential correctness of that thesis that the attempt of a later scholarship to impugn it has been unsuccessful.\\" Early American reviews by historians ranged from enthusiasm, with Henry Steele Commager, to expressed reservations from Elizabeth Donnan and Frank Tannenbaum. Ryden, writing in 2012 and relying on some citation analysis, spoke of three waves of interest in Capitalism and Slavery over the previous four decades and more, the first being associated with a largely critical review article of 1968 by Roger Anstey. The background was of consistent growth in attention.David Beck Ryden, Eric Williams' Three Faces of West India Decline, Review (Fernand Braudel Center) Vol. 35, No. 2 (2012), pp. 117‚Äì133, at p. 118. Published by: Research Foundation of State University of New York for and on behalf of the Fernand Braudel Center. Writing in 1994 in A Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century World History, Tadman stated that: > \\"A revised version of the Williams thesis (of economic and class self- > interest leading to abolition) seems to have much explanatory power. Rising > urban interests perceived slavery as unprofitable, backward, and a threat to > liberal (and middle-class) values.\\" Economic factors Richard Pares, in an article written before Williams's book, had dismissed the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations on the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there was had occurred after emancipation, not before. Heuman states: :In Capitalism and Slavery, Eric Williams argued that the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the abolition of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; it is now clear that the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.Gad Heuman \\"The British West Indies\\" in Andrew Porter, ed., The Oxford History of the British Empire ‚Äì Vol. 3: The 19th Century (1999) 3:470 Stanley Engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade or reinvestment of profits, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the Industrial Revolution. In support of the Williams thesis, Ryden (2009) presented evidence to show that by the early 19th century there was an emerging crisis of profitability.David Beck Ryden, West Indian Slavery and British Abolition, 1783-1807 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Richardson (1998) finds Williams's claims regarding the Industrial Revolution are exaggerated, for profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. He finds also that the \\"terms of trade\\" (how much the ship owners paid for the slave cargo) moved heavily in favour of the Africans after about 1750.David Richardson, \\"The British Empire and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1660‚Äì1807,\\" in P. J. Marshall, ed. The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century (1998) pp. 440‚Äì64. Ward has argued that slavery remained profitable in the 1830s, because of innovations in agriculture.J. R. Ward, \\"The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition,\\" in P.J. Marshall, ed. The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century (1998) pp. 415‚Äì39. Abolitionist sentiment In a major attack on the propositions brought forward by Williams, Seymour Drescher in Econocide (1977) argued that the United Kingdom's abolition of the slave trade in 1807 resulted not from the diminishing value of slavery for the nation, but instead from the moral outrage of the British voting public.Seymour Drescher, Econocide: British Slavery in the Era of Abolition (1977). Geggus in 1981 gave details of the sugar industry of the British West Indies in the 1780s, casting some doubt on the method used by Drescher for capital valuation.David Geggus, The British Government and the Saint Domingue Slave Revolt, 1791‚Äì1793, The English Historical Review Vol. 96, No. 379 (Apr., 1981), pp. 285‚Äì305, at p. 287. Published by: Oxford University Press Carrington in a reply from 1984 advocated for two \\"main theses\\" stated in Capitalism and Slavery, and subsequently attacked by \\"historians from the metropolises\\": \\"the rise of industrial capitalism in Britain led to the destruction of the slave trade and slavery itself\\", and \\"the slave trade and the sugar industry based on slavery led to the formation of capital in England which helped in financing the Industrial Revolution\\".Selwyn H. H. Carrington, 'Econocide' ‚Äî Myth or Reality? ‚Äî The Question of West Indian Decline, 1783‚Äì1806, Bolet√≠n de Estudios Latinoamericanos y del Caribe No. 36 (Junio de 1984), pp. 13‚Äì48, at p. 13. Published by: Centrum voor Studie en Documentatie van Latijns Amerika (CEDLA) On the detail of Drescher's periodisation in arguing against the first of those theses, Carrington then says that Drescher is agreeing with what Ragatz had argued in 1928, namely that decline set in at peak prosperity for the planters, but was misplacing that peak by systematic neglect of the effects of the American Revolutionary War, and the slow subsequent recovery from those.Selwyn H. H. Carrington, 'Econocide' ‚Äî Myth or Reality? ‚Äî The Question of West Indian Decline, 1783‚Äì1806, Bolet√≠n de Estudios Latinoamericanos y del Caribe No. 36 (Junio de 1984), pp. 13‚Äì48, at pp. 15‚Äì19. Published by: Centrum voor Studie en Documentatie van Latijns Amerika (CEDLA) Later developments Robin Blackburn in The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776‚Äì1848 (1988) summarised the thesis of Capitalism and Slavery in the terms that it took slavery to be a part of colonial mercantilism, that was then overtaken by the colonial expansion and domestic wage labour of the rising European powers. Noting that Williams provided both argument and illustration, while ignoring slavery in the United States, he considers the schematic ultimately \\"mechanical and unsatisfactory\\". He finds David Brion Davis fuller on abolitionist thought, and Eugene Genovese better on the resistance ideas of the enslaved people. Catherine Hall and the other authors of Legacies of British Slave-Ownership: Colonial Slavery and the Formation of Victorian Britain (2014) identified four key arguments of Capitalism and Slavery, and wrote of a schism between Anglo-American historians and those from the Caribbean on their status. The context is a series of projects run by University College London, with Web presence at www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs. The stated arguments are: # Slavery as key to the Industrial Revolution. # Slave-created wealth as integral to Great Britain in the 18th century. # Economic decline by 1783, or even 1763. # The role of the West Indies slave-owners changed from the leading economic edge, to behind the times. These are all recognised as somewhat contentious, with #1 and #3 particularly so. All four are considered fundamental to the project work, and capable of being illuminated by the gathering of further data. Gareth Austin writing in the Cambridge History of Capitalism vol. II (2014) describes the rejection of Williams's thesis about the economic impact of slavery on the Industrial Revolution as revisionist interpretation. He goes on to describe a challenge to that interpretation by Joseph E. Inikori, based on whole-Atlantic trade and (for example) the hinterland trade of British cloth destined for West Africa. He footnotes a comment \\"One should distinguish the issue of causality of the industrial revolution from the fact that various specific industrial investments were indeed made with profits from slave ships or slave estates, as Williams documented.\\" Notes Category:1944 books ","title":"Capitalism and Slavery"},{"id":"64213430","text":"The following is a list of pipeline accidents in the United States in 1986. It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also: list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States.  Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization. * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars. * Liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel). * Releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post-incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1986: * 1986 On January 31, a 14-inch Sunoco pipeline began leaking gasoline in Mercer County, New Jersey, which then spilled into the Delaware and Raritan Canal. The spilled gasoline exploded and burned along a 2,500 foot portion of the canal. People were evacuated from homes, and a nearby church. * 1986 On February 10, a construction crew cut through a gas pipeline in Lakeland, Florida, resulting in about 175 people being evacuated from mobile homes and businesses for 2 hours. There were no injuries. * 1986 On February 21, near Lancaster, Kentucky, a 30-inch diameter Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline gas pipeline ruptured due to corrosion. 3 people had serious burns, and 5 others had lesser injuries. External corrosion made worse by difficulties of cathodic protection in rocky soil was the cause. The pipe was manufactured in 1957. A senior vice president for operations and engineering with Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline Co. said tests on the Garrard County line last September showed the line needed immediate replacement. It was the third explosion on the Texas Eastern pipeline system in Kentucky in the previous 10 months, leading the Kentucky PSC to call for pressure reductions on the Texas Eastern system.https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=P-86-014 * 1986 An 8-inch diameter high-pressure petroleum pipeline ruptured in Muskegon County, Michigan on February 22, spilling gasoline into creeks. * 1986 On February 24, a natural gas transmission pipeline split for 40 feet along its longitudinal seam in Case, Arkansas. Examining the pipe after the accident revealed lack of fusion, a known issue with LF-ERW pipe used there. The pipeline has experienced 3 other such seam failures on that pipeline since 1975. * 1986 On March 12, a backhoe snagged a natural gas distribution line in Fort Worth, Texas, causing a break that leaked gas into an unoccupied building. Later, that building exploded, injuring 22 people, destroying the unoccupied building and damaging 40 other buildings. 57 automobiles in the unoccupied building were damaged or destroyed. * 1986 A new water main was being installed in Chicago Heights, Illinois on March 13. While excavating, an active gas service line was snagged. Gas company crews responded to the wrong site, causing delays in getting the leaking gas line shut down. Just as crews finished closing the valve on the leaking line, a nearby house exploded, and began to burn; One of the two persons inside that house was killed, and the other was injured. Two neighboring houses were damaged, and one gas company employee, two construction crew members, and four persons in the general area, were injured by the explosion and subsequent fire. Although gas company personnel arrived on the scene approximately 10 minutes before the explosion and shut off the gas at the meter, neither they nor the contractor's crew had made an effort to warn or evacuate the residents of the house. * 1986 A gravel company endloader ruptured a Lakehead Pipeline crude oil pipeline on April 12 near Elgin, Illinois, spill about 525,000 gallons of crude, and causing a \\"geyser\\" of crude oil. * 1986 A backhoe ruptured an Olympic Pipeline line on May 8, south of Seattle, Washington. About 1,974 barrels of diesel fuel were spilled, with some of it entering the Green River. * 1986 On May 14, a 6-inch Amoco pipeline, damaged by some type of arcing, leaked about 380 barrels of gasoline in Elmhurst, Illinois. Some of the gasoline fumes exploded in a nearby home, causing serious damage. Concerns about the lack of evacuations were raised later on. There were no injuries reported. * 1986 On June 28, a pipeline ruptured and spilled diesel fuel into Trail Creek in Michigan City, Indiana. The fuel later ignited. Thousands of fish were killed. * 1986 Early on July 8, a Williams Companies petroleum products pipeline ruptured in Mounds View, Minnesota. Gasoline at 1,434 psi sprayed a residential area around 4:20 am local time, then ignited. A woman and her 7-year-old daughter suffered fatal burns, at least two others were injured, and many homes damaged or destroyed. Confusion by the pipeline company led to a delay in shutting down the pipeline. Electrical resistance welded (ERW) seam failure caused the rupture. Prior to this accident, this pipeline, installed in 1957, had 16 seam failures during hydrostatic testing, and 7 seam failures during operations until 1984. In 1984, 16 more seams failed during a hydrostatic test. Problems with cathodic protection were also noted before the 1986 accident. During a hydrostatic test of this pipeline following the accident, 3 ERW seams failed. Studies of available data by OPS staff in early 1988 showed that ERW seams have been involved in 145 service failures in both hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines since 1970 to early 1988, and that of these failures, all but 2 occurred on pipe manufactured prior to 1970. * 1986 A Southern Natural Gas transmission pipeline failed and burned, in a compressor station, near Prattville, Alabama, on July 12. The fire spread by melting flange gaskets on 2 other gas transmission pipelines in the station. 4 homes and several cars were destroyed in the following fire, with flames reaching high. There were no injuries. * 1986 On July 22, a leak at an underground propane storage facility in Petal, Mississippi exploded, causing a massive fire, injuring 14 people, and forcing 200 people to evacuate. A crater 260 feet in diameter and 37 feet deep was made by the explosion. * On August 28, two workers checking the inside of a 30-inch gas pipeline were apparently overcome by nitrogen being used to purge that pipeline, in Flemingburg, Kentucky, and died. 6 other workers were injured in that incident. * 1986 Between 800 and 1200 residents were evacuated in East Chicago, Indiana, after a gasoline tank at a pipeline Terminal ruptured on September 4. 28 people were overcome by gasoline fumes. There was no fire. * 1986 A CENEX 8 inch petroleum products pipeline failed near Billings, Montana on September 4, spilling gasoline, and causing the evacuation of nearby businesses. About 29,400 gallons of gasoline spilled. There was no fire. * 1986 On September 4, a tank failed at a Phillips Petroleum Company facility in East Chicago, Indiana, forcing 800 to 1,200 residents near by to evacuate, and spilling 55,000 barrels of gasoline. * 1986 On September 8, an Amoco gas condensate pipeline failed under the Red River near Dexter, Texas. Fumes from the leaking pipeline sent 14 people to hospitals for treatment. * 1986 In October, a 21-inch long crack on a 14-inch Sunoco petroleum products pipeline in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania spilled about 220,000 gallons of gasoline, forcing evacuations, including about 900 students from a middle school. The failure was near a previously repaired area. * 1986 On November 13, a gas transmission pipeline failed near Stinnett, Texas, killing one person. The pipeline has been installed in 1982. * 1986 On December 6 in the early morning hours a 30-inch natural gas pipe line exploded on the north edge of the Ross Barnett Reservoir (Pelahatchie Bay) in Mississippi, near Jackson. There were no casualties. The blast was seen by airline pilots as far away as Houston TX and Nashville TN. * 1986 On December 25, an Amoco pipeline ruptured, and spilled furnace oil into the Des Plaines River near Chicago, Illinois. About 429 barrels of furnace oil were spilled. External corrosion was the cause of the pipeline failure.

The following incidents occurred during 1985: * 1985 Natural gas from a leaking line traveled through soil, and caused a massive gas explosion in El Paso, Texas on January 8. Eleven people were injured, 2 homes were destroyed, and 88 other homes were damaged by the blast. * 1985 On January 26, a leaking propylene pipeline in Baytown, Texas forced the evacuation of 600 people. There was no explosion or fire. * 1985 On February 5, a gas triggered explosion and fire destroyed 12 newly constructed condominiums in Twin Lakes, Wisconsin. A cracked gas main was the source of the gas leak, and nearby sewer work was suspected of damaging the gas line. Two firefighters were hurt extinguishing the fire. * 1985 On February 22, 1985, a police patrolman on routine patrol smelled strong natural gas odors in Sharpsville, Pennsylvania. A gas serviceman was ordered to the scene. Before the serviceman arrived at the site of the reported leak, the Sharpsville Inn, and a connecting building, exploded and burned, killing two persons. Firefighters arriving on scene moments later encountered a second, smaller explosion, which injured one firefighter. The delay in the gas serviceman getting to the incident was a contributing factor. * 1985 On April 5, lightning caused a computer malfunction with Colonial Pipeline, resulting in a pipeline rupture that sent at least 126,000 gallons of gasoline into the Yellow Leaf Creek in Talladega County, Alabama. * 1985 On April 18, fumes from an NGL pipeline, under repair near Baxter Pass, Colorado, killed one pipeline repair worker, & injured 9 others. During a lawsuit dealing with this accidents, it was claimed \\"The \\"safety\\" procedures used were crude at best, as the workers without lifelines were directed to hold their breath and go down into the ditch for about 30 seconds to work, before coming back out of the ditch for air.\\" * 1985 A 30-inch diameter gas pipeline operating at about 960 psi, weakened by atmospheric corrosion, ruptured, and tore out about of the carrier pipe, blew apart about of a 36-inch casing pipe, blasted an opening across Kentucky State Highway 90, and cut out a pear-shaped crater approximately long, wide, and deep near Beaumont, Kentucky. 5 people were killed in one home, and 3 injured. The fireball from the incident could be seen 20 miles away.(April 27, 1985) * 1985 On May 10, a Mohave County, Arizona road crew hit a 2-inch gas pipeline, while reinstalling a fallen stop sign, in Butler, Arizona. During repairs to the gas line, a flash fire ignited, injuring 2 fire fighters, and a Southern Union Gas Co. worker. * 1985 Workers on the extension of the North Dallas Tollway ruptured a 12-inch gasoline pipeline on June 19, causing a massive gasoline spill along a creek bed north of Dallas, Texas. The gasoline later ignited. One person had moderate injuries, several office buildings were damaged by fire, and some automobiles were damaged. * 1985 On June 20, a telephone cable installing crew broke a 10 inch gas gathering pipeline, in Paradise, Texas, releasing gas, that ignited 20 seconds later. There were no injuries. * 1985 On July 23, in a rural area about south of Kaycee, Wyoming, a girth weld cracked during a pipeline re-coating project on a 23-year-old, 8-inch pipeline. The cracked girth weld allowed the release, atomization of, and ignition of aircraft turbine fuel under 430 pounds pressure, killing one person, burning six other persons, and destroying construction equipment. * 1985 A gasoline leak of up to from a ruptured 10-inch pipeline ignited, on August, 2 in Indianapolis, Indiana, causing a high fireball that killed three people, and injured 3 others working to clean up the spill along a creek. * 1985 On August 22, a vessel was being filled with Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), when it burst, leading to a flash fire that burned 6 people, at a gas facility in Pinson, Alabama.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR-86-01-SUM.pdf * 1985 On September 23, a 12-inch diameter gasoline pipeline fitting was hit by a backhoe, and sprayed about of gasoline into the air in Staten Island, New York. There were evacuations, but no fire. * 1985 A Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. natural gas pipeline exploded near Hillsboro in Fleming County, Kentucky on October 26. There were two injuries reported. * 1985 On November 1, a Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline exploded and burned near Rowenna, Pennsylvania, shooting flames 200 feet into the air, and causing dozens of residents to evacuate. A gas metering station and pressure regulator were also damaged. * 1985 On November 28, Olympic Pipeline spilled about 31,000 gallons of jet fuel at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, due to a valve being left open. The fuel entered a storm drain, that led to the Des Moines River, killing fish and wildlife for 2.5 miles. Later, the company was fined $15,000 for the spill by the Washington Department of Ecology. * 1985 On December 6, a natural gas explosion and fire destroyed the River Restaurant in Derby, Connecticut. Gas escaping from a broken gas main at a pressure of about 1 pound per square inch had escaped, migrated into the restaurant basement, ignited, exploded, and burned. Of the 18 persons inside the restaurant at the time, 6 were killed and 12 were injured; 1 passerby and 1 firefighter were also injured. After the accident the street adjacent to the restaurant was excavated where a 24-inch sewer system had just been installed; An 87-year-old, 3-inch, cast-iron natural gas main was found broken. * 1985 On December 5, a Central Florida Pipeline products line burst in Lake Alfred, Florida, spilling about 40,000 gallons of gasoline.

She founded the Association Astronomique du Nord in 1923. She was particularly known for her work popularizing astronomy in France through public demonstrations and the development of planetaria.  Early life  Reysa Bernson was born in Lille September 28, 1904. Her parents, D√©sir√© Verhaeghe and Dweira Bernson-Verhaeghe, were both doctors. In 1920, her parents separated, though they did not divorce. After the separation, Reysa frequently went by her mother's family name, Verhaeghe. Her father died when she was 26.  Education  Reysa Bernson attended high school at the Lyc√©e F√©nelon de Lille. In 1921, she obtained her baccalaur√©at Sciences et Langues and completed her first year of Russian studies at the University of Lille. In 1922, she obtained her baccalaur√©at from the Facult√© des Sciences. In 1923, she finished her undergraduate degree in Russian studies from the University of Lille. In 1924, she finished a degree in science. In the following years, she would complete certifications in a number of fields: astronomy, chemistry, and radiotelegraphy. In 1927, she earned a teaching certification. In 1934, she earned a doctorate in astronomy from the University of Lille. Bernson was active in student life at the University of Lille. Bernson participated in restarting the student publication Annales de l'Association des √âtudiates de Lille. In 1926, Bernson was a delegate to the 15th Congr√®s de l'Union Nationale des √âtudiants de France in Poitiers. The following year, she became treasurer of the newly-formed Lille student union. On April 27 of 1927, she was elected vice-president of the National Student Union, the only woman elected to a cabinet position in the organization. In 1928 and from 1931 to 1934, along with her studies, Bernson worked as pr√©parateur, or athletic trainer, at the University of Lille.  Career  Reysa Bernson was passionate about astronomy from a young age. On May 5, 1920, at the age of 16, she was admitted to the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France. In 1923, Reysa Bernson founded the Association Astronomique du Nord (AAN), an organization with the aim of founding an observatory and a library, as well as gathering amateur astronomers in the region. Bernson also worked to generally introduce students throughout the region to astronomy. in 1932, she won the Henry Rey prize from the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France in recognition of her work popularizing astronomy. In 1936, Reysa Bernson, along with Henri Lhote, created an √âclaireurs de France scouting group, the Groupe Camille Flammarion, to encourage youth participation in astronomy. The group arranged star-watching excursions and learned to read star maps. In 1937, Reysa Bernson was the secretary general of the Planetarium of the Exposition Internationale in Paris, which saw around 800,000 visitors during the six months of the exhibition. Two notable visitors to the Planetarium were astronomers Armand Delsemme and G√©rard de Vaucouleurs. In 1938, Bernson was recognized for her work during the exhibition in encouraging more people to join the society by being awarded two prizes from the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France: the Prix de l'Observatoire de la Guette and the M√©daille comm√©morative. On June 2, 1940, twelve days before the Nazis invaded Paris, Reysa Bernson met with other members of the Soci√©t√© Astronomique at Camille Flammarion's grave at the Camille Fammarion Observatory near the city. Archival records indicate that Bernson remained professionally active in some capacity during the Occupation up to 1943.  Death  On February 23, 1944, Reysa Bernson, along with her mother, Dweira Bernson-Verhaeghe, were arrested in Dreux, to the west of Paris, for being Jewish. Despite the efforts of friends in Lille to save them, the women were sent shortly afterward to a concentration camp in Drancy, with a one-day stop in Chartres. On May 7, Reysa Bernson and her mother were sent to Auschwitz, where they were killed by the Nazis.  Memorials  There is an asteroid named after Bernson: 21114 Bernson. By decision of the municipal council in 2018, there is an all√©e Reysa Bernson in the Saint-Maurice Pellevoisin quarter of the city of Lille.

The building has existed since the 13th century and was used as a church from then until the mid 20th century, when wartime damage forced it to close. It is now an arts centre, having been converted in 1976 and extended 13 years later. Historic England has listed the building at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. History St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket Church in 2010. St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket Church existed as a chapel in the 13th century. It is situated near East Street in central Chichester, accessible only by way of two alleyways. Historically, the church was the property of the Dean of Chichester, and the church owned much land in the area until the Reformation. Additions to the church were made in the 14th, 15th and 19th centuries. The north window of the church depicts Saint Cecilia, and the south window of the church has a tribute to poet William Collins, who is buried in the church. The church used to house a portrait of William Cawley, though this been moved to Chichester Cathedral. In 1878, the parish of All Saints-in-the-Pallant‚Äîa former church which was also built in the 13th-century‚Äîwas merged into the St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket parish. In 1943, during the Second World War, St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket Church was badly damaged by bombing. The congregation of St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket moved into the unused All Saints-in-the-Pallant church. The church was deconsecrated in the 1950s, by which time it was disused and empty. In the 1960s, Archdeacon of Chichester Lancelot Mason proposed turning the church into an art gallery as Chichester had no art galleries at the time. Between 1971 and 1976, the building was restored and converted from a church into an arts centre. In 1976, the church opened as the Chichester Centre of Arts, which was later renamed to the Oxmarket Centre of Arts. In 1989, the church was extended using rubble stone. In 2020, planning permission was given for more renovations to be made to the building in order to modernise it. St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket Church is a Grade II* listed building. A wall to the north of the church is also Grade II listed. The church is open to the public, and multiple artworks are on display there. Architecture The church, a small building which \\"in scale [is] exactly like churches in nearby villages\\", is built of stone and flint. The outside walls are rendered apart from at the east end, where the quoins are of stone dressed with ashlar, and the west end which is supported by substantial buttresses. The stonework which has been obscured by render includes some reused fragments of herringbone pattern work of the Norman era and rubble taken from the demolished Roman walls around the city centre. The windows, all lancets, vary in date from 13th- to 19th-century; the three-light east window dates from the latter. The doorway at the west end is 14th-century. On the roof is a weatherboarded bell-cot topped with a short broach spire. Inside, the plan is simple: a nave and chancel with no chancel arch or structural division. There is a wooden gallery, and the timber roof is 19th-century. The extension of 1989 was designed by architect Peter Fleming and consists of a two-bay projection with glazed gables, built onto the north wall.

Despite an order for five, only one had been completed before Hodkinson Aircraft went bankrupt near the start of the Great Depression. It operated in Guatemala for several years. Design and development Hodkinson Aircraft was founded in 1929 by William Wadsworth Hodkinson, one of the pioneers of the film industry who in 1916 had organized Paramount Pictures. He later went into film distribution, founding the W.W.Hodkinson Co. and then moved into the aviation business. The HT-1 was built by Valley Manufacturing Co. a division of Hodkinson Aircraft based in Glendale, California. Its designer, Don R. Berlin, later designed the Curtiss P-40. The wings of the HT-1 were both built around spruce spars and had rectangular plans out to rounded tips. The upper wing, with three-quarters of the total wing area, provided most of the lift and mounted narrow chord, Friese ailerons that reached from wingtips to above the outer engines. The short, lower wings were braced to the upper ones with parallel interplane struts between the wing spars. The HT-1 was powered by three Curtiss Challenger radial engines, one in the nose and the others on top of the lower wing, braced by vertical struts to the upper spars. Behind the central engine the fuselage was flat sided, with the wing centre-section fixed to it by inverted V cabane struts faired into the fuselage's chrome-molybdenum tube structure. These provided a clear rear view from the pilots' cabin under the leading edge of the wing. Pilot and co-pilot sat side-by-side with dual controls, though the co-pilot's controls could be removed to allow an extra passenger to be carried. Their cabin was normally accessed through doors on either side but there was also a door in the rear which led down to the passengers' windowed, six seat cabin. There was a toilet at the back and also a baggage compartment, though this was only accessible from outside. Cabin access was via doors on either side, opening just ahead of the rear seats. Its tail was conventional, The fixed surfaces, like the fuselage, had chrome- molybdenum tube structures and the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage. The fin was braced to the tailplane and had a cropped, roughly triangular profile. The balanced rudder had a blunted rectangular profile. The HT-1 had fixed, wide track, conventional (), landing gear. Its mainwheels, fitted with brakes, were on axles and drag struts from the lower fuselage longerons which placed them below the outer engines. Vertical shock absorber legs joined the lower wing engine mountings. There was a tailwheel at the rear. Operational history The HT-1 first flew on 17 July 1929. It was publicized at the Cleveland Aero Show in September 1929 and entered into the Cleveland based 1929 National Air Races. It won a contract for five examples from a Guatemalan airline, Compan√≠a Nacional de Aviaci√≥n, which Hodkinson had founded but Hodkinson Aircraft were in financial difficulties in 1930 as the depression deepened. Though the company ceased trading in 1930, the prototype went to Guatemala and remained in use there for several years.

He was the imperial son-in-law of Sultan Mehmed VI of the Ottoman Empire. Early life ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk was born on 27 February 1898 in Ortak√∂y Palace. He was the son of last caliph of the Muslim world Abdulmejid II and his wife ≈ûehsuvar Hanƒ±m. He was the elder half-brother of D√ºrr√º≈üehvar Sultan. He was the grandson of Abdulaziz and Hayranidil Kadƒ±n. Education For his early education, he was sent to Galatasaray Lyc√©e. His father, Abdulmejid, spoke French and had the connection with the school through a close Tevfik Efendi. √ñmer Faruk's application was prepared by Salih Keramet Bey, the son Ottoman poet Nigar Hanƒ±m, who had given private lessons to the prince. √ñmer Faruk attended the Galatasaray Lyc√©e for a few years, until it was decided that he should have a more serious vocational training, and at the age of eleven he was sent to Europe. He was to have a military education, and as was common practice with princes at the time, he attended the school created by the Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna in 1751, the Theresianum Military Academy. √ñmer Faruk spoke English, German and French with a German accent. His German was as adequate as his Turkish. After a visit to the Hƒ±rka-ƒ± Saadet, the Chamber of the Blessed Mantle in the Topkapƒ± Palace, where lengthy prayers were said, he made his way to Vienna. Salih Keramet Bey accompanied him, and settled him into the academy. He spent several years there, undergoing military training that also included extracurricular courses in basket- weaving, carpentry, masonry, construction works, metalworking, and other manual skills. But for more rigorous, iron-fisted and disciplined training, √ñmer Faruk was transferred from Vienna to Potsdam Military Academy in Prussia. The transfer idea was of Ismail Enver Pasha, the most powerful man of Ottoman Empire. Enver Pasha wanted young ≈üehzades should receive a military education, and for this purpose he allocated the Palace of Ihlamur as the ≈ûehzadegan Mektebi (the Princes‚Äô School). It became compulsory for all ≈üehzades below the age of fifteen to attend this school. Here besides their military training they were taught literature, history, religion, mathematics, and geometry. ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk and Abdulmejid I's grandson ≈ûehzade Mehmed ≈ûerefeddin, who was the brother of Naciye Sultan, who was Enver Pasha's wife, the two princes were transferred to Germany strong military training. The ministry of war issued a Decree for the education for the two princes. √ñmer Faruk graduated from the Prussian Military Academy in Potsdam as a professional Prussian officer. His demeanour reflected his strict German education, and until his death he remained a severe soldier but only in appearance, as deep down he was a romantic at heart, and he never gave up his Turkish habits. Participation in World War I During World War I, √ñmer Faruk fought for the Germans. The ≈üehzade was sent to Galicia, and from there to Verdun, where he was assigned to the battlefield and where the battles with the French were quite bloody. He fought like a professional soldier, and Kaiser Wilhelm II granted him first the Red Eagle medal, then the Iron Cross of the First Degree. The Kaiser sent a golden cigarette case, as well as a signed photograph of himself together with the medal. When the Germans lost the battle at Verdun, √ñmer Faruk returned to Potsdam, where he was appointed to the German emperor‚Äôs First Foot Guards Regiment. The two requirements for enrolment in this regiment were that one must belong to one of the most aristocratic families in Germany and be taller than 1.9 meters. Every Prussian prince was registered as an officer in this regiment from the age of ten, but those short in height would not take part in the parades. The ≈üehzade was accepted into the regiment despite being only 1.85 meters tall. He was the shortest among his colleagues, yet he took part in all the parades in front of the kaiser. In addition to being a successful soldier and one of the members of the Ottoman Dynasty, ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk, one of the most important sportsmen of his period, chaired the Football Fenerbah√ße Sports Club for a total of 5 years between 1919-1924. Personal life=First marriage Sabiha and her husband, √ñmer Faruk ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk and Sabiha Sultan, the daughter of Mehmed VI and Nazikeda Kadƒ±n, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, were in love with each other. When Abdulmejid asked Sabiha's hand in marriage for his son, Mehmed flatly refused as there was no such thing as a marriage between cousins. His mother ≈ûehsuvar, called on Nazkieda Kadƒ±n, and succeeded in convincing her. The marriage took place on 5 December 1919, in the pavilion of the sacred relics, Topkapƒ± Palace. The marriage was performed by ≈ûeyh√ºlislam Hayrizade Ibrahim Efendi. Sabiha Sultan's deputy was Ba≈ükatip Ali Fuad Bey, and √ñmer Faruk's deputy was √ñmer Yaver Pasha. The wedding reception took place four months later on 29 April 1920 at the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. In May 1920, ten days after their wedding, Faruk and Sabiha moved to the mansion of Rumelihisarƒ±. In October of the same year, Mehmed VI bought two houses for his daughters in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ±. The mansions were known as the Twin Palaces. He gave one house to Ulviye Sultan, and the other to Sabiha. Faruk and Sabiha decided to live in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± during the winter and Rumelihisarƒ± in the summer. Issue and exile The couple's eldest daughter, Nesli≈üah Sultan was born on 4 November 1921 in the Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± Palace. She was followed two years later by Hanzade Sultan, born on 19 September 1923 in the Dolmabah√ße Palace. At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, √ñmer Faruk and his wife and daughters and his parents firstly settled in Switzerland and later in France Later they moved to Nice, where her youngest daughter Necla Hibetullah Sultan was born on 15 May 1926. In 1940, he attended the wedding of her daughter, Nesli≈üah Sultan and Prince Mohamed Abdel Moneim, son of Egypt's last khedive Abbas Hilmi II. His two other daughters, Hanzade Sultan, and Necla Sultan also married Egyptian princes, Mehmed Ali Ibrahim in 1940, and Amr Ibrahim in 1943 respectively. Divorce and second marriage √ñmer Faruk developed an increased interest in his cousin Mihri≈üah Sultan, the daughter of crown prince ≈ûehzade Yusuf Izzeddin. It was also a public knowledge that things weren't going well between Faruk and Sabiha. In 1944, Mihri≈üah even sided with Faruk when the council chose Prince Ahmed Nihad as the head of the family. While Sabiha backed the council's decision and approved the choice of the leader. Her daughters also sided with her. Faruk accused Sabiha of turning their daughters against him. But he was already in love with Mihri≈üah and the issue of the council was just an excuse. Faruk divorced Sabiha on 5 March 1948, after twenty eight years of marriage, and just four months later married Mihri≈üah in a religious ceremony on 31 July 1948. In the prenuptial agreement she asked that the right to divorce her husband be included in the contract. However, their marriage did not last and a few years later, Mihri≈üah divorced Faruk using her right to divorce her husband. Later Faruk would tell his friends \\"I divorced the most beautiful woman in the world to marry the ugliest one. Fate!\\" Death ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk died on 28 March 1969 in Cairo, Egypt, his body was taken back to Istanbul and was buried in the mausoleum of Sultan Mahmud II.

Armstrong was an American physicist known for her work at the National Bureau of Standards certifying the United States' radium supply. She was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1931. Early life and education Armstrong grew up in Waltham, Massachusetts and attended a two-room country schoolhouse until she entered Waltham High School, where she studied Latin, German and French. Her mother hoped that she would attend Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, but she chose Wellesley College instead after visiting there with a friend. At Wellesley, she originally intended to major in French and German, but she took a physics course on the advice of her older half-brother, an engineer, and she went on to earn a degree in physics with a minor in chemistry. Armstrong graduated from Wellesley in 1919.  Career  Armstrong developed an interest in radioactivity during her time at Wellesley, and after graduating, she took a job at the National Bureau of Standards. The Bureau's radium laboratory had the responsibility of checking the quality and amount of radium samples, and the lab director was frequently absent due to a stomach ulcer. \\"So,\\" Armstrong later recalled, \\"after only a few months, I found myself more or less in charge of certifying all the radium sold in the United States.\\" After three years at the Bureau of Standards, Armstrong went to Radcliffe College for graduate studies, where she investigated X-ray spectroscopy with William Duane. During her graduate studies, she fell ill for half a year due to X-ray overexposure. She worked as an instructor at Wellesley, and then took an assistant position at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in 1927. In 1942, she held the office of secretary-treasurer for the New England section of the American Physical Society. She returned again to Wellesley and became a professor of physics, eventually leaving in 1953 to conduct research at Los Alamos.

Biography Lombard was born in La Ciotat, but his family moved to Martigues when he was a few years old. His father, Paul-Baptistin Lombard, who took part in the French Resistance, was shot and killed by the Germans on 13 June 1944. Lombard entered the municipal council of Martigues in 1953 following the resignation of his mother. That year, he led the French Communist Party's (PCF) ticket against incumbent Mayor Paul Pascal of the French Section of the Workers' International. In 1959, Francis Turcan was elected mayor, and Lombard became his financial assistant. Then during the Turcan administration, Martigues began its modernization, moving on from its industrial past. After Turcan died in 1968, Lombard became Mayor of Martigues. He would be re-elected in 1971, 1977, 1983, 1989, 1989, 1995, 2001, and 2008, winning a majority in the first round every time. The city was heavily modernized, as it did not have a sewage system in 1959. The construction of the Martigues canal and the central water treatment plant were significant steps taken during the Lombard administration. Additionally, the construction of the H√¥pital Rayettes, the Lyc√©e Jean Lur√ßat, and the highway to Fos-sur-Mer and Arles were completed in 1974. A new library was built in 1981 and a new town hall was constructed in 1983. In 1993, the Halle de Martigues was built, and, in 1995, the Th√©√¢te des Salins. Lombard was re-elected for the 7th time in 2008, but announced his departure in 2009, giving the reins to Gaby Charroux. The transition of power took place on 29 May 2009 in front of 3000 people.

His leadership was simultaneously brought into question after food editor Sohla El-Waylly accused the magazine of discriminating against employees of color. That day, Rapoport announced he would step down.

The civil war was fought between Liberal and Conservative lines with Francisco Moraz√°n leading the Liberals and Manuel Jos√© Arce, a former Liberal, leading the Conservatives.  Prelude  Manuel Jos√© Arce became the first President of the Federal Republic of Central America on April 29, 1825. On October 10, 1826, Arce dissolved the congress to allow for a new unitary conservatives congress to be elected, turning his back on the liberals which he was a part of. This unconstitutional move was rejected by the Honduran head of state, Dionisio de Herrera, but President Arce did not recognize Herrera's authority, claiming that Herrera's provisional mandate had expired and that he was in power illegitimately. The National Assembly had called for new elections in Honduras, but Herrera ignored the decree and remained in power. For these reasons but under the guise of protecting Cop√°n's tobacco plantations owned by the federal government, Arce decided to oust Herrera.  Civil War = Coup in Honduras  Dionisio de Herrera was appointed as Head of State of Honduras by the Constituent Assembly on September 16, 1824. According to the Constitution of Honduras of 1825, his mandate would end after only three years on September 16, 1827. Manuel Jos√© Arce ordered Jos√© Justo Milla, de Herrera's former Deputy Chief of State, to overthrow Dionisio de Herrera in 1827. On April 4, 1827, General Milla prepared for the attack on the city of Comayagua with 200 men, while General Francisco Moraz√°n led the defense troops of the besieged city. Milla ordered the advance and relentlessly faced the Honduran troops under intense fire. The contest ended with the victory of Milla's forces who proceeded to burn down the capital. President Dionisio Herrera was taken prisoner on May 9 and was sent to Guatemala. Jos√© Justo Milla took control of the city while General Moraz√°n managed to leave the capital with Colonel Remigio D√≠az and Colonel Jos√© Antonio M√°rquez, arriving in Tegucigalpa, there he is reinforced with 300 men and his intentions are to return to the Comayagua Valley, but at the height of Villa de San Antonio, was attacked by an advance troop under the command of Colonel Hern√°ndez and Captain Rosa Medina. Moraz√°n took a defensive position at the La Maradiaga hacienda. In battle on April 29, Colonel Hern√°ndez and his invading forces were defeated. Moraz√°n returned to Tegucigalpa to strengthen himself further. Francisco Moraz√°n, with a safe-conduct, went to Choluteca in southern Honduras, where he met his family in Ojojona but was taken prisoner by the Commander of Arms of Tegucigalpa. He left on bail some 23 days later and was forced to flee to El Salvador on July 28, 1827, with intentions on fleeing to Mexico. He then moved to Le√≥n in Nicaragua on September 15, 1827, where his friend General Jos√© Anacleto Ord√≥√±ez, known as \\"Cleto\\" Ord√≥√±ez, provided him with 135 men to recapture Comayagua. Salvadoran soldiers were then added to the command of Colonel Jos√© Zepeda.  Battle of La Trinidad  Battle of La Trinidad.

D) Company in reserve under Captain Francisco Ferrera (100 men). In blue is the 2nd Federal Battalion and reserves from Honduras and Guatemala under General Jos√© Justo Milla. In October 1827, Moraz√°n entered Choluteca where Colonel Jos√© Antonio M√°rquez awaited him with a division of men to join the liberating cause. The first Honduran town they arrived in was San Antonio of Texiguat. The town offered Moraz√°n support with weapons and men. General Jos√© Justo Milla discovered the presence of General Francisco Moraz√°n in southern Honduras and quickly moved with his troops to Tegucigalpa, where he established his command headquarters. Moraz√°n went to the town of Sabanagrande to prepare for a decisive fight in the Valle de la Trinidad. At 9am on November 11, 1827, the first movement of maneuvers was carried out by Colonel Ram√≥n Pacheco. He positioned himself to defend the Avenue that leads from Ojojona to the Valle de la Trinidad. He then attacked Milla's center line. Colonel Remigio D√≠az, under the command of a detachment of 150 men moved along the bank of the Sicatacaro ravine, headed northwest, from Ojojona to Valle la Trinidad and attacked the enemy rear. General Moraz√°n, together with Colonel Rom√°n Valladares, surrounded the Caranguije hill and attacked the right flank of the Federal Forces. The combat intensified for five hours, at 15:00 (3:00 p.m.) the federal troops of Milla were crushed by the men under the command of General Francisco Moraz√°n. The defeated General Jos√© Justo Milla and some of his surviving officers fled the battlefield, leaving documents, trunks, and other supplies. There were forty casualties between wounded and dead. The reservist force allied under the command of Colonel Jos√© Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez Osejo and Captain Francisco Ferreratook no further action to pursue Milla. After this victory, Moraz√°n marched to Tegucigalpa to recapture it on November 12. On November 26, he arrived at the capital Comayagua where he made his triumphal entry and occupied the headquarters of the State of Honduras which was interim chaired by Miguel Eusebio Bustamante. Morazan installed a new government in Honduras by appointing himself as Head of State of Honduras.  War in El Salvador  After his victory in La Trinidad, Moraz√°n emerged as the leader of the liberal movement and became recognized for his military skills throughout the Federal Republic of Central America. Moraz√°n received calls for help from liberals in El Salvador. Salvadorans opposed the new conservative congressmen and other government officials elected by the decree issued on October 10, 1826. Salvadorans demanded the restitution of former political leaders, but President Arce argued that this measure was necessary to restore constitutional order. In March 1827 the government of El Salvador responded by military force. Salvadoran troops marched towards Guatemala with the intention of taking the capital of the Republic and toppling Arce's government. However, President Arce himself took command of his federal troops and defeated the Salvadorans in the early hours of March 23 at the Battle of Arrazola. The Salvadoran division dispersed and the officers fled. The field was strewn with corpses, prisoners, weapons, ammunition, and luggage. After the battle, President Arce ordered two thousand federal troops under the command of General Manuel de Arz√∫ to occupy El Salvador. Meanwhile in Honduras, Francisco Moraz√°n began preparing to recapture El Salvador. He resigned as Head of State of Honduras and has Diego Vigil replace him. He went to Texiguat where he prepared and organized his troops for the Salvadoran campaign. In April 1828, Moraz√°n went to El Salvador with a force of 1,400 men. This group of militants, known as the Protective Allied Army of the Law, was made up of small groups of Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Salvadorans who contributed their own tools of war, others with the support of the Indians who served as infantry. Some volunteers followed their liberal convictions, others worked for a political leader, others simply hoped to earn something for their efforts after the war ended. This was the combination of forces that joined Moraz√°n in his fight against federal troops. While the Salvadoran army faced off against federal forces in San Salvador, Moraz√°n settled in the eastern part of the state. On July 6, Moraz√°n defeated Colonel Vicente Dom√≠nguez's troops at the El Gualcho ranch. In his memoirs, Moraz√°n described the battle as follows: Moraz√°n kept fighting around San Miguel defeating every platoon sent by General Arz√∫ from San Salvador. The defeats convinced Arz√∫ to leave Colonel Mont√∫far in charge of San Salvador and to personally deal with Moraz√°n. When the liberal caudillo became aware of Arz√∫'s movements, he left for Honduras to recruit more troops. On September 20, General Arz√∫ was near the Lempa River with five hundred men in search of Moraz√°n when he learned that his forces had capitulated in Mejicanos and San Salvador. Meanwhile, Moraz√°n returned to El Salvador with a respectable army. General Arz√∫, fighting illness, fled back to Guatemala, leaving his troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Antonio de Aycinena. The colonel and his troops were marching towards Honduran territory when they were intercepted by Moraz√°n's men in San Antonio. On October 9, Aycinena was forced to surrender. With the capitulation of San Antonio, El Salvador was finally free of federal troops. On October 23, General Moraz√°n made his triumphal entry into the Plaza de San Salvador. A few days later, he marched in Ahuachap√°n, to organize the army with goal of overthrowing conservative aristocrats and ecclesiastics from power in Guatemalan territory and implanting a constitutional order to restore order to the Central American Federation. On October 20, 1828, the government of Aycinena appointed Antonio Jos√© de Irisarri as Minister of War, with the rank of colonel, to restore discipline in the ranks of the Guatemalan army. Irisarri was taken prisoner and was only saved from execution when a soldier pleaded for his life; He was sent on foot to San Salvador bound by arms, where he was imprisoned for nine months. Upon learning Irisarri's capture, the conservative governor of Guatemala, Mariano de Aycinena y Pi√±ol, attempted to negotiate with Moraz√°n. As he was determined to end the hegemony of the aristocrats and ecclesiastics Guatemalans, Moraz√°n did not accept any deal. Aycinena, seeing that he could not find a peaceful solution, wrote to his fellow citizens:  Push to Guatemala  In Ahuachap√°n, Moraz√°n did everything possible to organize a large army. He asked the government of El Salvador to provide him with 4,000 men, but he had to settle for 2,000. When he was in a position to act in early 1829, he sent a division under Colonel Juan Prem to enter Guatemalan territory and take control of Chiquimula. The order was carried out by Prem despite resistance offered by the enemy. Soon after, Moraz√°n moved a small force near Guatemala City to force the enemy out of its trenches and cause the desertion of its troops. Meanwhile, Colonel Vicente Dom√≠nguez, who had left Guatemala City with six hundred foot soldiers to attack Prem, learned of the small force that was near Guatemala City. Dom√≠nguez changed his plans and went after the small force. This opportunity was seized by Prem who moved from Zacapa and then attacked Dom√≠nguez's forces, defeating them on January 15, 1829. After these events, Moraz√°n ordered Prem to continue his march with the 1,400 men under his command and occupy the post of San Jos√© Pinula, near the Guatemalan capital. Plaza Central of Antigua Guatemala in 1829. Meanwhile, the people of Antigua Guatemala organized against the conservative government of Aycinena in Guatemala and put the department of Sacatep√©quez under the protection of General Moraz√°n. The allegiance of Sacatep√©quez hastened Moraz√°n's invasion into Guatemala. He placed his men in the town of San Jos√© Pinula near Guatemala City. Military operations in the capital began with small skirmishes in front of the government fortifications. On February 15, one of the largest divisions of Moraz√°n's army, under the command of Cayetano de la Cerda, was defeated in Mixco by federal troops. Due to this defeat, Moraz√°n lifted the siege of the city and concentrated its forces in Antigua. A division of federal troops followed him from the capital under the command of Colonel Pacheco in the direction of Sumpango in Sacatep√©quez and El Tejar in Chimaltenango with the purpose of attacking him in Antigua. But Pacheco extended his forces, leaving some of them in Sumpango. When he arrived in San Miguelito on March 6 with a smaller army, he was defeated by General Moraz√°n, which once again raised the morale of the men of the liberal leader. After San Miguelito's victory, Moraz√°n's army increased in numbers when Guatemalan volunteers joined its ranks. On March 15 when Moraz√°n and his army were on their way to occupy their previous positions, he was intercepted by Colonel Prado's federal troops at the Las Charcas ranch. Moraz√°n, in a superior position, crushed Prado's army. The battlefield was strewn with corpses, and the Allies took numerous prisoners and seized a considerable number of weapons. Subsequently, Moraz√°n mobilized to regain his former positions in San Jos√© Pinula and El Aceituno, and again began a siege on Guatemala City. General Verveer tried to mediate between the State Government and Moraz√°n, but they could not reach an agreement. Military operations continued with great success for the Allied Army. To prepare the defense of the city and threatened by the troops of Moraz√°n, Aycinena ordered on March 18, 1829 that the death penalty would be applied to everyone who aided the enemy. He made a proclamation invoking the defense of sanctity of the altars and issued a legal provision by which liberal leaders Pedro Molina Mazariegos, his son, Esteban Molina, Antonio Rivera Cabezas, and military leaders Cleto Ordo√±ez, Nicol√°s Raoul, and Isidoro Saget were declared enemies of the state. On April 12, the head of state of Guatemala, Mariano de Aycinena y Pi√±ol, capitulated. The next day, the Plaza Central was occupied by Moraz√°n's troops.  Aftermath  Immediately after the surrender of Guatemala City on April 13, President Arce, Mariano Aycinena, Mariano Beltranena y Llano, and all the officials who had had a role in the war, were imprisoned. After these events, General Moraz√°n led Central America for three months until June 26, 1829 until Congress appointed Senator Juan Barrundia as President of Central America. Moraz√°n expelled Aycinena and Pi√±ol, Guatemalan conservative aristocrats, and most of the members of the Aycinena Clan that he directed, along with his allies, members of the main regular orders, and senior clergy of the Catholic Church. Not content with the expulsions, he confiscated all their property. On June 4, 1829, the Moraz√°n government issued a law imposing the death penalty on all members of the Aycinena Clan who had participated in the conservative government of Guatemala, including Irisarri, prior to the return to the treasury of the wages from his three years of work and the confiscation of all his property. Irisarri managed to escape from the Salvadoran prison on January 7, 1830 and embarked from Acajutla for Guayaquil, in Ecuador, where he took refuge.

The community was settled in the early 19th century by Black slaves who had been brought to the colony by their Loyalist owners after the American Revolutionary War. The neighbourhood was bounded by Euston, Pownal, Richmond, and West streets, and by Government Pond. The neighbourhood was demolished for a redevelopment project in the early 20th century. History Around 1810, Samuel Martin ( 1750 - 1863), a freed slave known as \\"Black Sam\\", petitioned the city government for a parcel of land in the city's west end, adjacent to Government Pond and across from land set aside for the future Government House. While Martin was never formally granted the parcel, the low-lying, marshy land was seen as undesirable by the city's wealthy residents, and a group of freed slaves eventually settled in the area. The land's low value also attracted other impoverished Islanders, and over time the area became a mixed-race slum with a peak population of about 100 residents. A central feature of the Bog was the Bog School, constructed in 1848 on Kent Street on land donated by Royal Navy Captain John Orlebar. African Canadian teacher Sarah Harvie was the school's only teacher, and the school closed upon her retirement in 1903. By the time of the school's closure the demographics of the neighbourhood had evolved, as the original Black residents intermarried with white families or migrated to more robust Black communities in the United States. The Bog was shortly after demolished for a redevelopment project.

History = Foundation  A congregation for Sailors and Fishermen had previously been established in the town as early as 1850. The first purpose built 'Bethel' opened in 1863 situated on Commercial Road, before later moving to the larger purpose built building on Battery Green Road in 1899.  Construction  Construction of The Bethel on Battery Green Road commenced on July 21st 1898 when the foundation stones were laid. The building was designed by local architect Frederick Wilbraham Richards of Stanley Street, Lowestoft. The building work was carried out by Mr. C. R. Cole of Lowestoft. The main chapel room was designed to accommodate 900 Fishermen for worship. The total cost of building was ¬£4,000 which was officially opened on Thursday 23rd February 1899.

Early life Jhung was born on May 27, 1937, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His multiracial heritage includes Korean, Scottish and English ancestors. The youngest of three sons, born to Caroline and Walter Jhung, Finis' parents ran a tailor shop on Oahu's Hickam Air Force Base. The building was damaged, but not destroyed, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. At the end of World War II, as soldiers left the base, the Jhungs' business suffered. Finis' disconsolate father packed up and left Hawaii for the mainland. His mother filed for divorce which was granted in 1945 when Finis was nine years old. As a child he studied tap, ballet, acrobatics and hula. As a teen, Jhung auditioned for Anton Dolin and Alicia Markova, then on tour in Hawaii. Dolin suggested that Jhung come see him when he \\"grew up.\\" Finis began studying ballet in earnest at the University of Utah, where he trained with Willam Christensen. While in college, he performed in musicals, The King and I, Carousel and Damn Yankees, as well as ballets, Coppelia and The Nutcracker. He graduated in 1959 with high honors. In 1960, he spent six months in the National Guard. While stationed at Ft. Leonard Wood, Jhung received a telegram from Rodgers and Hammerstein telling him they needed an Asian dancer who could perform double tours en l'air for Flower Drum Song on Broadway. Jhung successfully passed the audition, completed his military service and joined the troupe in New York. Dancer Already in its second year, \\"Flower Drum Song\\" ran for a few more months on Broadway and then went on the road. When the show played San Francisco, Jhung reconnected with Michael Smuin and Kent Stowell, University of Utah classmates, who were dancing with the San Francisco Ballet (SFB). Finis auditioned and was hired for the company; he stayed with the troupe for a year and a half. At the same time, Flower Drum Song was being made into a movie and he was invited to join the cast. By 1962, Jhung was ready to move on from SFB. He auditioned for and was accepted into the New York-based Joffrey Ballet, then known as the Robert Joffrey Theatre Ballet. He was immediately cast in Alvin Ailey's \\"Feast of Ashes\\" and Brian McDonald's \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" The Joffrey group was heavily dependent on funding from heiress and arts patron Rebekah Harkness. As her investment increased, she reportedly demanded a greater say in the company's operation. In 1964, this culminated in a split that led Harkness to establish her own ballet troupe. Eleven Joffrey dancers, including Jhung, joined the Harkness Ballet. He stayed with the Harkness company from 1964 to 1969. In his memoir, Jhung says he initially served as the troupe's \\"exotic,\\" while he longed to dance the principal roles in \\"white tights\\" (classical) ballets. In 1966, during a European tour, Jhung was introduced to Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism by the company's shiatsu masseuse. Shortly after beginning his new religious practice, he was profiled in Dance Magazine and chosen for a white tights role in Dolin's \\"Variations for Four.\\" Jhung also found the courage to ask Rebekah Harkness for a promotion to Principal Dancer, which he was given. Jhung danced lead roles in Norman Walker's \\"Night Song,\\" Brian MacDonald's \\"Zealous Variations,\\" John Butler's \\"Sebastian,\\" and George Balanchine's \\"Minkus Pas de Trois.\\" In his review of \\"Variations for Four\\", Saturday Review critic Walter Terry wrote, \\"Jhung combines the brio of the Western world with the clean clear linear delicacies and elegances of his part-Oriental heritage. He is the lad whose every movement is photographic-you don't see preparations, only results.\\" Buddhist In March 1969, following the New York season, Jhung decided to give up dancing to devote himself to Buddhism and world peace. To mark a break between his old and new lives, he burned his ballet memorabilia, books, photos, and films he had made of favorite dancers such as Erik Bruhn. Jhung found a nine to five job as office manager for an investment firm. He spent his evenings leading Buddhist group meetings, conducting lessons for new converts and providing one-on-one guidance. In January 1972, the office closed leaving Jhung unemployed. According to the dancer, \\"My mission in life as a Buddhist is to help others. When I see people in trouble in ballet class, I want to help them solve their technical and artistic problems. I can't see any point in letting students continue working incorrectly, when they would look so much better if they followed my instructions. What else is there to do in life but help others? And, solving these problems in class leads me to create instructional videos, which can be used by people all over the world. I try to instill in my students what we call in Buddhism \\"a seeking spirit.\\" To learn the truth so that you can apply it and better yourself.\\" Teacher In 1972, on the advice of his Buddhist leader, Jhung began teaching ballet. Since then, he has been a mainstay of the New York dance scene. He has taught members of New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, the Robert Joffrey, Alvin Ailey, Paul Taylor, Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham companies, as well as Broadway performers, aspiring professionals and amateur adult beginners. He operated his own studio from 1974 until 1987. During this period, Finis founded his own company, Chamber Ballet USA. He has also taught classes at The Broadway Dance Center, The Alvin Ailey American Dance Center, Peridance, Ballet Arts, The New Dance Group Arts Center, and Steps. Throughout the year, Jhung presents workshops for dance teachers and adult students. Jhung has rarely taught young children. When he first started dance instruction in his own studio, he only taught professionals. Over time, he transitioned away from professionals to teaching only amateur adult dancers, including beginners. Chamber Ballet USA In June 1981, Jhung was approached by Stephen Belth, director of the Arts and Science Development Service, Inc. with the idea of forming an eight-member touring company, four men and four women, performing the works of world-class choreographers. The founding group of Chamber Ballet USA included Jhung as Artistic Director, Belth as Executive Director, and a four-member board that included Gwen Verdon. The first four ballets in the repertory were John Butler's \\"Othello,\\" Vicente Nebrada's \\"Lento, a Tempo e Appassionato,\\" Toer Van Shayk's \\"Jeux\\" and Lois Bewley's \\"Russian Blue.\\" The company debuted on March 6, 1982, with a performance honoring Verdon. The public premiere took place December 14 through 19 in The Space at City Center. Chamber Ballet offered numerous opportunities for fledgling choreographers. It allowed Jhung to make ballets, too. In the spring of 1986, Antony Tudor (who would die the following year) re-staged his ballet \\"Sunflowers\\" for the company's final season. The reviews were universally positive. One critic hailed the performance as \\"glowing and spirited...The dancers are young and vigorous, and communicate to the audience their love of dance.\\" In June 1986, upon the resignation of Chamber Ballet USA's Board of Trustees President, the company finished its bookings and then folded. Ballet Dynamics, Inc. When Chamber Ballet USA collapsed, Jhung returned to teaching full-time. Unable to resume classes at his former studio, he accepted guest teaching jobs at the Bartholin International Seminar in Copenhagen, before going to work at Richard Ellner's Broadway Dance Center. He would remain there until 1994. Throughout his career, Jhung studied with some of the world's best-regarded ballet teachers: Vera Volkova, Erik Bruhn, Rosella Hightower, Valentina Pereyaslavec, Stanley Williams and Willam Christensen, but the two that had the biggest impact were Joanna Kneeland and David Howard. Kneeland's process applied anatomy and physics to dance instruction, while Howard's combined the Kneeland method with the basic classical training he had learned at The Royal Ballet. The New York Times described Howard's teaching style as \\"...a kinaesthetic approach, in which dancers were taught to rely less on external feedback from the mirror and more on the minute internal signals that telegraph the position of the head, limbs and torso in space.\\" In 1994, Jhung began to codify his own teaching techniques in a series of videos designed for dancers and dance teachers. A fellow dancer and dance teacher who regularly took his classes had said he should be more commercial. She thought that teachers who had not been professional ballet dancers, but ran successful studios, would benefit from videos that emphasized solid technique. She suggested Jhung break down the steps to make ballet easier to understand. Since then, he has produced more than 50 instructional dance videos and 18 music CDs to accompany them, which he distributes through his business Ballet Dynamics Inc. In 2014, Jhung published The Finis Jhung Ballet Technique: A Guide for Teachers & Students. The book also \\"concentrates on the essentials for absolute and advanced beginners - of any age and body type - with an eye toward organic movement logic.\\" Billy Camp In 2008, the children‚Äôs casting director for \\"Billy Elliot: The Musical\\" asked Jhung to teach the call-back classes for the original Broadway production. In addition to teaching at the call-backs, he taught regular classes for \\"Billys\\" of the original Broadway production and both national touring companies. At \\"Billy Camp,\\" Jhung instructed boys who were under serious consideration for the role but were too young or required additional training. Working with these boys had special meaning for Jhung. In a Dance Magazine interview, he recalled, \\"when I was 11 years old growing up in pre-TV Hawaii, I used to dance around the house for hours to the same music from \\"Swan Lake\\" that is used for Billy‚Äôs dream ballet.\\" Personal life In 1972, Jhung married Yuriko Honsho, first in a City Hall wedding, then in a traditional Buddhist ceremony. They divorced in 1985. They have one son Jason. Finis has been the subject of numerous articles in national publications and was featured as a ‚Äúballet virtuoso‚Äù on Lifetime TV. In 2018, Jhung wrote a lavishly-illustrated autobiography, Ballet for Life: A Pictorial Memoir.

The aims of the expedition were to survey recently discovered sea routes between Isle de France (now Mauritius) and India, to seek the postulated Terra Australis Incognita (undiscovered Southern land), and to explore Australia. After successfully completing the first part of the mission, Fortune and Gros Ventre sailed South, and discovered the Kerguelen Islands. After the two ships got separated in the fog, Fortune aborted her mission and returned to Isle de France, where the news of the discovery led to vastly overenthusiastic descriptions of the new lands. Meanwhile, Gros Ventre continued on her mission, reaching Australia and surveying part of its Northern coast before returning to Isle de France.  Conception  In early 1770, Kerguelen had drafted a project to bring Ahutoru back to Tahiti, and take the opportunity to explore the Southern Pacific Ocean, in search of a Terra Australis Incognita. His proposal was rejected for financial reasons. In September 1770, Kerguelen renewed his proposal, but international tensions caused another rejection. In January 1771, Kerguelen made a third attempt, this time channeling his ideas though Terray, Aiguillon and Clugny. Kerguelen wanted to pursue the voyages of Bouvet de Lozier, in search of a large continent that he expected to exist between the 45th parallel and the South Pole. In April, Kerguelen was given orders to sail to Isle de France with Rochon to survey Grenier's newly proposed maritime route to India. He was then to sail South in search of austral territories, follow the new putative coast up to Cape Circoncision, and sail on to France via R√≠o de la Plata.  Voyage  On 1 May 1771, Lieutenant Kerguelen departed France on the 56-gun Berryer, bound for Isle de France (now Mauritius). Berryer arrived at Port-Louis on 20 August. Kerguelen met Poivre and Marion Dufresne. Rochon also spent time with Poivre, as well as with Ahutoru, discussing the floras of Tahiti. Poivre suggested Rochon be transferred to Marion's expedition, but governor Desroches refused. On 13 September, Kerguelen departed Isle de France with the 24-gun fluyt Fortune and the 16-gun Gros Ventre to survey Grenier's route. Gros Ventre and Fortune sailed South, the crew suffering considerably from the cold, for which they were neither prepared nor equipped. On 13 February 1772, they sighted land, and Ensign Boisguehenneuc managed to land, and claim the new shore for France. On 14 February, the weather was bad and Fortune effected repairs on her damaged mainmast, while Gros Ventre hugged the coast to survey it and attempt a landing. Gros Ventre found herself in unchartered shallow waters, and Kerguelen despatched his cutter Mouche, under Ensign Rosily, to provide assistance and bring orders to meet at Isle de France should Fortune and Gros Ventre be separated. Rosily managed to reach Gros Ventre but broke his foremast in the process. He nevertheless managed to sound in front of Gros Ventre, allowing her to reach safer waters. Gros Ventre launched a boat, under Mengaud, to claim the territory for France. Mengaud managed to land, and then deployed a white flag and buried bottled containing texts of the claims. Mengaud stayed about 15 minutes on the island, and noted that the birds there did not seem to fear humans, indicating that the land was not inhabited. He then returned to Gros Ventre. Gros Ventre picked up Mengaud's and Rosily's parties. She abandoned Rosily's cutter, which was too large to bring aboard. Fortune sailed away to avoid the worse of the storm, and on 16 she found herself separated from Gros Ventre. The two ships searched for each other for two days, before giving up. Fortune returned to Isle de France under Kerguelen, Gros Ventre sailed under Saint Alo√ºarn to the 40th Southern parallel, where she arrived on 4 March, and on 17, she reached Cape Leeuwin. She continued on an independent exploration of the Northern coast of Australia before returning to Isle de France.  Aftermath  On 16 July, Kerguelen arrived at Brest. He then went to Versailles, arriving on 23. On 25 July, the Navy Minister introduced him to Louis XVI. Kerguelen reported his finding, and Louis XVI promoted him to Captain on the spot. Kerguelen equated his finding with the land discovered by Gonneville, and made enthusiastic descriptions of his discovery. British newspapers further inflated these exaggerations, and stated as fact that the newly discovered lands were inhabited by an advanced, enlightened and friendly people. Kerguelen made no efforts to dispel this misconceptions. Instead, he requested five fluyts to mount a second expedition and confirm his findings. The fad around Kerguelen led to the cancellation of Bougainville's plans for an expedition to the North pole, and to organising the Second voyage of Kerguelen.

So when the bridge goes up, the balance and the bridge deck turn parallel. The drawback of a traditional double-beam drawbridge is that it has a limited clearance height. That is why the balance box sometimes does not hang between the two arms, but on the arms themselves, without the arms being connected to each other. So there are two balance boxes. Many variants have been made on the basic design of the double- beam drawbridgee. They are both double-rotating (with two separate bridge decks) and single-rotating and with a diagonal bridge deck. In the latter case, there is only one tower or Hamei style, which is next to the road. The pivot point of the balance with the balance box can either fall behind the hamei gate (as in the photo), or directly above it. The latter system is referred to as an 'Amsterdam type'. The advantage of this is that the tower is only loaded under pressure . When the pivot point falls behind the column, the tower is loaded eccentrically; this gives both pressure and flexion . When double-beam drawbridges are opened and closed electrically, an electric motor with a gear is often located at about half height in the Hamei styles. This engages in a rack that is hinged to the bridge deck. This construction can also be seen in the photo. The rack is often not straight, but with a curvature at the end, like a hockey stick - this is to give the electric motor time to rev up and gradually raise (and lower) the bridge.

It aims to encourage the emergence of a music streaming economy that fairly remunerates songwriters and composers for their work\\"CISAC Annual Report 2016\\" p. 59, and to give consumers and creators the information they need to make ethical choices when producing, distributing, streaming or purchasing music. Adopted as a core program by the International Council of Music Creators (CIAM)\\"CISAC Annual Report 2016\\" p. 28\\"CISAC Annual Report 2017\\" p. 12, 17, 36, 40 & 41, the campaign is overseen by an independent not- for-profit organisation called Fair Trade Music International, headquartered in Canada and backed by over 500,000 music creators worldwide. The board is made up of songwriters and composers with industry specialists as advisors, all volunteers. It includes renown Canadian songwriter, Eddie Schwartz, and the contemporary Italian composer, Lorenzo Ferrero. History The Fair Trade Music concept began at the University of Ottawa in 2007 when Professor Jeremy DeBeer introduced the concept to his Digital Music and the Law seminar classes. Soon thereafter, Professor DeBeer and one of his students, Safwan Javed, explored developing an accompanying certification process that would provide clear, ethical choices to music consumers. In 2010, Javed joined the board of Canada‚Äôs largest music creator organization, the Songwriters Association of Canada (S.A.C.), who immediately embraced Fair Trade Music and began carrying the project forward. In 2012, S.A.C. joined with other Canadian and US-based music creator organizations to form Music Creators North America (MCNA) and the initiative quickly took hold. Fair Trade Music International was incorporated in Toronto, Canada in 2015 and the following year, was officially adopted as a main campaign for CIAM, which brought hundreds of thousands of music creators from Africa, Latin and South America, Asia, Europe and North America to the campaign. As quoted Jean-Michel Jarre, then President of CISAC in his 2015 call on UN for a fairer creative ecosystem: \\"Equally important in our eyes are the rights of creators. Without these moral and economic rights, creators would be deprived of ways to sustain a living and continue to create freely, and would also lose control over the use of their works. But for this to happen, creators need to be granted fair remuneration for the use of their creative works. In the music sector, we have launched the Fair Trade Music project to address this issue.\\"\\"Billboard Magazine - 4/27/2015 Interview by Lars Brandle\\" The Fair Trade Music Study Fair Trade Music was originally based upon the 2014 Study Concerning Fair Compensation for Music Creators in the Digital Age commissioned by MCNA and CIAM. Written by Pierre Lalonde, former director of economic research for the Copyright Board of Canada, the report presented comprehensive, empirical evidence that suggested an alternative business model was urgently needed if the digital economy was to be sustainable.\\"CISAC Annual Report 2015\\" p. 8 & 31 According to Fair Trade Music, the report made three key observations: music as undervalued by digital music platforms\\"Cultural Times, The first global map of cultural and creative industries (Dec 2015) by Ernst & Young Global Limited\\" p. 9 & 88, the split of revenues as imbalanced, and licensing deals as lacking transparency. Based upon these findings, the study concluded that fair trade models could prove more effective in creating a virtuous value chain than government regulation because laws simply could not keep pace. Activities The Fair Trade Music movement vowels to be active in three areas: using education, lobbying and expert comment to raise awareness and drive an understanding of the challenges facing music creators; issuing and managing a Supporter‚Äôs Seal to highlight individuals and organisations that have pledged to support the principals of the movement; and finally, operating a certification program\\"CISAC Annual Report 2016\\" p. 33 & 59\\"CISAC Annual Report 2019\\" p. 40 for individual music releases based upon a developed set of criteria for ethical behaviour. Supporting organisations The Fair Trade Music movement claims to count some of the largest music creator societies from all regions of the world amongst its supporters. The organization that administers the movement is also led by a number of renown songwriters, composers and industry experts, each of whom has direct experience of the importance of equitable musical economy. Starting with the Songwriters‚Äô Association of Canada back in 2010, shortly followed by Music Creators North America and the Songwriters Guild of America, the list of supporting organisations now includes the International Council of Music Creators, the Council of Music Creators, the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance, the Pan-African Songwriters and Composers Association, the Screen Composers Guild of Canada, La Soci√©t√© professionnelle des auteurs et des compositeurs du Qu√©bec, the Society of Composers and Lyricists, and the Alianza Latinoamericana de Compositores y Autores de M√∫sica.

Originally part of the ancient woodland of the Forest of Dean, it survived clearances that created the settlement of Newland and was afterwards pollarded for timber. Its large size was often remarked upon through the years and it was considered a rival to the Cowthorpe Oak as the largest oak tree in Great Britain. Much of the tree fell during heavy snow in 1955 but a single branch of the tree survived until 1970 when it was killed during an arson attack. A replacement tree grown from one of the Newland Oak's acorns had been planted in 1964. History The oak dated back to AD and is thought to have formed part of the vast Forest of Dean, an ancient woodland covering much of Western Gloucestershire. The tree was an English oak, Quercus robur. Much of the forest was cleared in later years, from which the nearby settlement of Newland derives its name (as \\"new land\\" reclaimed from the forest), and in later years the tree stood alone in a field of Spouts Farm about north-west of Newland Church. The tree had been pollarded for timber and for centuries was known as the \\"Great Oak\\". As one of the largest oaks in the country the tree was the subject of some fame. The antiquary John Timbs described it as \\"one of the most remarkable trees in the country\\" in 1839 and an engraving of the tree was included in P. J. Ducarel's De Wyrhale book of poetry in 1836. By 1874 the tree was said to be \\"battered and decaying\\", though naturalist Edwin Lees thought it might live another 500 years. The tree was badly damaged by heavy snowfall in May 1955 which caused much of the structure to collapse and it was described as \\"long much-decayed\\" in 1964. One live branch survived but this was killed by an arson attack in 1970. A replacement tree, grown from one of the Newland Oak's acorns, was planted by Cyril Hart, verderer of the Forest of Dean, on 21 December 1964. The replacement tree survives and a partly rotten segment of the original trunk was still visible in 2011. Hart described the tree in 1966 as having taken \\"200 years to grow, 200 years to exist, and 200 to die\\". Size  The size of the tree, typically measured by its girth around the trunk, has been often measured and commented upon. It was measured at in girth in 1839 and in 1875, with a girth of up to was considered a challenger to the Cowthorpe Oak as the oldest in Britain. A 1906 measurement recorded of girth and the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica recorded when measured at a height of from the ground. In 1931 it was recorded as at a height of above the ground and in 1950 was said to be in girth. The Cowthorpe Oak fell in 1950 and by 1954 the Newland Oak was being described as having \\"the greatest girth of any tree in Britain\\". A Her Majesty's Stationery Office publication of 1964 recorded that the Newland Oak had the greatest girth of any tree recorded in Britain in modern times, but Julian Hight, writing in 2011, states that it was only the second- largest girth of an English oak (after the Cowthorpe Oak).

She enjoyed writing and reading from childhood and names authors Christopher Pike and Lois Duncan, and the book Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry as early favorites. She studied sociology in university and attended graduate school for clinical psychology before leaving to pursue a career in publishing. Morrow lived in Great Britain and Montreal before returning to the United States.  Career  Morrow's first novel, Mem was released in 2018. Set in Montreal in 1925, the science-fiction novel tells the story of an alternate reality where people's memories are extracted and replayed constantly by half-living creatures called Mems. The book received positive critical reception and was described by Publisher's Weekly as \\"ambitious and insightful, raising questions about memory, trauma, and humanity.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"With her dizzying concept, richly imagined narrator, ornate setting, and first-rate storytelling, Morrow offers an epiphany for readers of speculative fiction with echoes of ideas explored in films like Blade Runner and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\\" The book was recommended by the Chicago Review of Books, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and BuzzFeed News.

It is an edited anthology that \\"aims to provide marginalized teens visibility and validation in stories of ‚Äúeveryday resistance.‚Äù\\" Wesley Jacques of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books described Take the Mic in a review: \\"...too many of the stories are didactic and wrenchingly contrived, losing the plot and characters to hammer the message.

The Sundowner's 11-story hotel opened in May 1975, and the casino opened two months later. With 349 rooms, it was the largest hotel in Reno until the opening of the MGM Grand in 1978. A 19-story hotel tower was added in 1979, bringing the total number of rooms up to 583. Profits fell after the opening of the nearby Silver Legacy resort in 1995. Because of poor revenue, the Sundowner closed in November 2003. It was sold the following year, and work began to convert the hotel rooms into condominium units, with the original hotel building reopening in 2007, as The Belvedere. Work on the 19-story tower was halted following financial problems, and the building remains unfinished. History=Sundowner The property was previously occupied by the Central Junior High School, which operated until 1966 and was demolished two years later. In 1973, plans were announced for a hotel project to be built on the land, with construction expected to begin at the end of the year. Completion was originally scheduled for mid-1974. The Sundowner hotel-casino was owned by George R. Karadanis, Robert M. Maloff, and Max Hoseit. Karadanis and Maloff had been business partners since 1959. The project was developed by Lake Tahoe Inn H.K.M., and was built by Cal Neva Development. William F. Morris was the architect, while the Los Angeles-based Culp and Tanner served as engineers. Prudential Insurance provided financing for the project. The 11-story hotel entered its final phase of construction in February 1975. Prudential was surprised upon discovering that the Sundowner was completed with casino space. The company did not intend to finance a gaming enterprise, and the developers initially said they had no intention of adding a casino to the project when they applied for the loan. Prudential's San Francisco office, which provided the loan, believed that the casino was merely a later addition with no intention of deceit. The hotel portion opened on May 23, 1975, while the casino, restaurant and bar areas were scheduled to open by July 1. The hotel was originally part of the Quality Inn chain, and it was the brand's second-largest hotel. The Sundowner was also the largest hotel in the city, with 349 rooms, surpassing Harrah's Reno. The Sundowner remained as Reno's largest hotel for the next three years, until the opening of the MGM Grand. The Sundowner would employ approximately 350 people upon its full opening. The property included meeting space for up to 260 people. In June 1975, the owners were denied a gaming license after the Nevada Gaming Control Board found Hoseit to be an unsuitable applicant. Hoseit, a California lawyer, had been named in several civil suits, accusing him of fraud, owing money, and causing pollution to water in Lake Tahoe. In July 1975, Karadanis and Maloff were approved as 50-50 gaming operators for the Sundowner, on the condition that Hoseit have no involvement with casino, food or beverage operations at the property. Hoseit remained an owner of the Sundowner. The casino opened later that month, with 200 slot machines. A year later, plans were announced for an eventual expansion that would include of gaming space and a 150-room tower, both to be built on land that was then occupied by the Stardust Motel. At the time, an expansion of the Reno-Sparks sewer plant was planned to take effect in 1979. In the meantime, the Reno City Council requested that citizens conserve water. In response, Karadanis announced that water-saving measures had been implemented at the Sundowner. He hoped to begin construction on the expansion by the end of 1976, although the project was contingent on whether the city would continue to issue building permits prior to the sewer plant expansion. Demolition of the Stardust Motel concluded in 1977, and construction began on a new building for additional casino, convention, and restaurant space. At the end of the year, the Reno City Council approved plans for a 19-story tower to be built at the base of the new casino building. Until the completion of the new sewer facility, large projects such as the Sundowner tower were restricted to using 10,000 gallons of sewer capacity per day. Buildings requiring more than that had to undergo a special review by the Reno City Council. Like the original building, the expansion was also designed by Morris. The 19-story tower was approved with casino space on the first four floors, hotel rooms on floors 5 through 10, and office space on the remaining floors. At the end of 1978, during construction of the tower, Karadanis had plumbing installed on the office floors, which he now intended to finish as part of the hotel. The city ordered construction to stop, as Karadanis did not have approval for the additional hotel rooms, and the added plumbing was a violation of the city's sewer allocation procedures. Work resumed in January 1979, after Karadanis had the plumbing removed. Karadanis said, \\"At the time I didn't think putting the plumbing in was such a serious offense.\\" Morris said that converting the \\"meager\\" office space into hotel rooms made more economic sense, as large office complexes were scheduled to open elsewhere in the city over the next few years. Two months after work resumed, the Sundowner became the focus of a federal grand jury investigation into sewer allocation procedures being taken by the city. The grand jury probe requested various documents and building plans related to the ongoing construction of the new tower. In April 1979, the Reno City Council denied Karadanis' request to add additional hotel space in the tower. It was the latest rejection from the council regarding the matter. Councilmember Bill Wallace, referring to the unauthorized installation of plumbing, said, \\"I understand the need for more hotel rooms. But my concern is that we have said no to Mr. Karadanis before and yet he goes ahead and tries to make hotel rooms anyway. We said no and you, in effect, said we don't care. Your organization is thumbing its nose at the council.\\" The council's denial contradicted an earlier recommendation of approval by the Regional Planning Commission. Karadanis re-submitted the proposal to the city two months later. The proposed hotel addition was looked over by the city's Major Projects Review Committee, which recommended the addition of 130 parking spaces. A staff analysis was conducted by the Regional Planning Commission and found that the additional hotel rooms would make the Sundowner too crowded, leading the planning staff to recommend denial of the project. The tower neared completion at the end of 1979, when the city approved the conversion of the office space into 162 hotel rooms. However, the tower would not be allowed to open until 1981, when sewer capacity would become available. The tower would require 15,390 gallons per day in sewage treatment. A buffet, as well as G.K.'s Steakhouse, were added in 1980. Also added in the expansion were larger banquet facilities. The new tower brought the total number of rooms to 583. The casino measured , and took up the first two floors. It included keno, table games, and a sportsbook. In 1982, a former construction worker won a $4.4 million lawsuit against Karadanis and Maloff after being paralyzed in an accident during construction of the tower four years earlier. A female impersonator show, Burlesque, ran at the Sundowner in the mid-1980s and was considered a success. In 1986, the Sundowner and Karadanis had to pay $1.2 million in punitive damages after being found liable for a theft that occurred in one of the hotel rooms two years earlier, the result of inadequate security. In 1987, hundreds of guests and employees were evacuated when an electrical fire broke out. The fire was contained after an hour, and was confined to concrete electrical transformer rooms, located beneath the hotel buildings. Smoke filled the casino and hotel, but there were no injuries. The Sundowner was closed for a few days to allow for an investigation of the fire. Electricity was out at the Sundowner during the fire, as the emergency generator had to be shut off due to the electrical system receiving fire damage. The Sundowner did not have battery-operated stairwell lights, prompting fire officials to recommend the installation of such lights in all Reno buildings over five stories in height. In 1990, an electrical fire broke out on the sixth floor of the 11-story hotel tower, destroying one room and forcing the evacuation of 40 other rooms. An electrical short circuit was the cause of the fire, igniting a mattress. A brief fire occurred in 1993, when flames ignited another mattress and forced an evacuation. The Sundowner was among filming locations for the 1996 film Hard Eight. Beginning in 1999, the Sundowner underwent $1 million in property upgrades, while an additional $1 million was spent on new casino games. In 2001, Karadanis said that the Sundowner had failed to make a profit ever since the Silver Legacy resort opened across the street in 1995. The Sundowner was among other small properties that struggled to compete with the 1,700-room Silver Legacy. Karadanis and Maloff ‚Äì who were 70 and 80 years old respectively ‚Äì expressed a great interest in selling the Sundowner if the right buyer were to come along. Approximately half of the Sundowner's clientele consisted of tourists who arrived through charter buses, although business suffered further when bus companies began diverting their customers to tribal casinos in California. On October 2, 2003, Karadanis announced that the Sundowner would close on December 1 due to economic losses, caused by competition with the Silver Legacy, as well as mega-resorts in Las Vegas and the tribal casinos in California. However, because of the financial problems, the Sundowner was unable to continue operations any longer and ultimately closed three weeks early, on the morning of November 10, 2003. Employees were given three days' notice, and did not receive a severance package. The closure affected 375 employees, and some of them subsequently pushed for changes to federal laws to give workers more financial protection whenever a business closes. A lawsuit was also filed by some of the workers. Redevelopment Siavash Barmand, a California developer, expressed an interest in purchasing the Sundowner and redeveloping it as a condominium facility with first-time buyers in mind. His company, Barmand & Associates, had previously redeveloped other buildings throughout California. Sale discussions with Karadanis and Maloff were underway in April 2004. Barmand intended to reopen the Sundowner as Belvedere Towers, with 377 condominium units. The project was named after Barmand's place of residence in Belvedere, California. The Reno Planning Commission approved Barmand's plans in June 2004, and he hoped to have the first residents move in within six to nine months. The Belvedere would offer affordable units in contrast to the new Riverwalk condominiums in Reno. Barmand was also in discussions with restaurant owners and grocery operators for new business space on the ground floor. He expected to take full control of the property in July 2004. 13-story Belvedere building in 2010 Although completion was set for January 2005, the date was pushed back as the development team found little to salvage inside the buildings. Bijan Madjlessi, a partner in the project, said that this led to design changes, with much of the interior being demolished, including walls. The Belvedere was developed by Menlo Oaks Corporation, a company led by Madjlessi. Belvedere LLC, a company owned by him, took over ownership of the property in 2006. Metcalf Builders of Carson City handled the renovation work. The initial work was focused on the 11-story north tower, which had been expected for completion in late 2005. However, interior construction was still heavily underway in mid-2006, with the first condo sales expected to be finalized in early 2007. Belvedere Towers had 70 units under contract to be sold to buyers. In 2006, during the ongoing condo conversion, a group of trade union construction workers protested against the project, stating that non-union workers were not receiving standard wages and health care benefits. The former Sundowner tower in 2010 The north tower was increased to 13 floors, and was completed with 177 units, marketed as student housing. As of 2008, the north tower was occupied by a dozen residents. Later that year, a fire occurred at the south tower, which was still undergoing construction as a condominium building. The south tower was not occupied, except for an office. The fire was confined to the building's north side exterior, and prompted an evacuation of residents in the north tower. Aside from fire damage to the exterior, the building also received smoke and water damage inside, where a sprinkler head activated in response. The fire caused $120,000 in damage, and was declared an arson. By the end of 2008, the Belvedere had been put up for sale, at a time when many local condo projects were suffering the effects of the Great Recession. More than 200 liens had been filed against the property, as well as two foreclosure default notices. Only 157 rooms in the south tower had been converted to condos before work stopped on the project. Completion of the tower had previously been expected in 2009. By 2010, the city had fined the project numerous times over code violations. Later in the year, clean-up began on the site, which included repairing and repainting the burned portion of the tower and removing a giant \\"condominiums for sale\\" sign. In March 2011, Madjlessi settled a lawsuit filed by Metcalf Builders over unpaid work for the project. By that time, the project had accumulated $783,000 in unpaid property taxes for the past four years, owed by developer Belvedere LLC. In April 2011, Washoe County auctioned 92 unsold units in the north tower, in order to receive the money that was owed in unpaid taxes. The units were sold for $2 million to David Lonich, an attorney from Santa Rosa, California who had previously represented Madjlessi. The individual units ranged in sale price from $12,000 to $45,000. Another 80 units in the north tower were already owned by other people and were not included in the auction. Madjlessi had already sold the south tower to Mountain Air Enterprises, a company owned by investor Steven Scarpa, who was a fellow resident of Marin County, California. Madjlessi retained control of the casino building located at the base of the tower. A month after the sale, Madjlessi was charged with felony insurance fraud, after filing duplicate claims with two insurance companies following the 2008 fire. Madjlessi died in an auto accident in 2014, and the Belvedere was appointed a receiver. The unfinished south tower was put up for sale for $12 million in 2016. Scarpa sold the south tower in November 2017, to Pine Cone Circle Investment, an affiliate of the Lake Tahoe company Prim Ventures. Because of the legal issues associated with the property, the sale took eight months to finalize. Prim looked at other properties ‚Äì such as 3rd Street Flats in Reno ‚Äì for ideas regarding the unfinished Sundowner tower, which contained nearly of space. Prim had no schedule for its plans, but intended to redevelop the tower as a mixed-use project that would include residential units, most likely apartments. For the lower floors, potential ideas included restaurants, retail, and a grocery store. The project would align with revitalization efforts focused on downtown Reno that were intended to attract more people to the area, including younger people.

The model was first suggested by L. Di√≥si when studying how possible gravitational fluctuations may affect the dynamics of quantum systems. Later, following a different line of reasoning, R. Penrose arrived at an estimation for the collapse time of a superposition due to gravitational effects, which is the same (within an unimportant numerical factor) as that found by Di√≥si, hence the name Di√≥si‚ÄìPenrose model. However, it should be pointed out that while Di√≥si gave a precise dynamical equation for the collapse, Penrose took a more conservative approach, estimating only the collapse time of a superposition.  The Di√≥si model  In the Di√≥si model, the wave-function collapse is induced by the interaction of the system with a classical noise field, where the spatial correlation function of this noise is related to the Newtonian potential. The evolution of the state vector \\\\psi_{t}\\\\rangle deviates from the Schr√∂dinger equation and has the typical structure of the collapse models equations: \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\,\\\\big(\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\langle\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\rangle_t\\\\big)\\\\,dW(\\\\mathbf{x},t) \\\\ &\\\\qquad {} - \\\\frac{G}{2\\\\hbar} \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\int d\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\big(\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\langle\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\rangle_t\\\\big) \\\\big(\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{y}) - \\\\langle\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{y})\\\\rangle_t\\\\big)} {\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}}\\\\,dt\\\\Bigg] \\\\psi_t\\\\rangle, \\\\end{align} }} where _j) }} is the mass density function, with m_j, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j and \\\\mu_{R_0}(\\\\mathbf{x}) respectively the mass, the position operator and the mass density function of the j-th particle of the system. R_0 is a parameter introduced to smear the mass density function, required since taking a point-like mass distribution : \\\\mathcal{M}_\\\\text{point}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^N m_j \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j) would lead to divergences in the predictions of the model, e.g. an infinite collapse rate or increase of energy. Typically, two different distributions for the mass density \\\\mu_{R_0}(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j) have been considered in the literature: a spherical or a Gaussian mass density profile, given respectively by : \\\\mu_{R_0}^\\\\text{s}(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j) = \\\\frac{3}{4\\\\pi R_0^3} \\\\theta\\\\big(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j - R_0\\\\big) and : \\\\mu_{R_{0}}^\\\\text{g}(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j) = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi R_0^2)^{3/2}}\\\\,\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j)^2}{2R_0^2}\\\\right). Choosing one or another distribution \\\\mu_{R_0}(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_j) does not affect significantly the predictions of the model, as long as the same value for R_0 is considered. The noise field w(\\\\mathbf{x}, t) := \\\\frac{dW(\\\\mathbf{x}, t)}{dt} in Eq. () has zero average and correlation given by where ‚Äú\\\\mathbb{E}‚Äù denotes the average over the noise. One can then understand from Eq. () and () in which sense the model is gravity-related: the coupling constant between the system and the noise is proportional to the gravitational constant G, and the spatial correlation of the noise field w(\\\\mathbf{x}, t) has the typical form of a Newtonian potential. Similarly to other collapse models, the Di√≥si‚ÄìPenrose model shares the following two features: * The model describes a collapse in position. * There is an amplification mechanism, which guarantees that more massive objects localize more effectively. In order to show these features, it is convenient to write the master equation for the statistical operator \\\\rho(t) = \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\big[\\\\psi_t\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\psi_t\\\\big] corresponding to Eq. (): {\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}} \\\\left(\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\rho(t) \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{y}) - \\\\frac{1}{2} {\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{y}), \\\\rho(t)} \\\\right). }} It is interesting to point out that this master equation has more recently re-derived by L. Di√≥si using an hybrid approach where quantized massive particles interact with classical gravitational fields. If one considers the master equation in the position basis, introducing \\\\rho(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, t) := \\\\langle\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}\\\\rho(t)\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}\\\\rangle with \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}\\\\rangle := \\\\boldsymbol{a}_1\\\\rangle \\\\otimes \\\\dots \\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{a}_N\\\\rangle, where \\\\boldsymbol{a}_j\\\\rangle is a position eigenstate of the j-th particle, neglecting the free evolution, one finds , \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, t)}{dt} = -\\\\Lambda(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}) \\\\rho(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, t) }} with , \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}) = \\\\frac{G}{2\\\\hbar} \\\\iint d\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\big(\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}) - \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}})\\\\big) \\\\big(\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}) - \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}})\\\\big)}{\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}}, }} where : \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}) := \\\\sum_j m_j \\\\mu_{R_0}(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\boldsymbol{a}_j) is the mass density when the particles of the system are centered at the points \\\\boldsymbol{a}_1, ..., \\\\boldsymbol{a}_N. Eq. () can be solved exactly, and one gets , \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, t) = \\\\rho(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, 0) e^{-t/\\\\tau_{\\\\text{DP}}(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}})}, }} where (\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Lambda(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}})}.}} As expected, for the diagonal terms of the density matrix, when \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}} = \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, one has \\\\Lambda(\\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}, \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}}) = 0, i.e. the time of decay goes to infinity, implying that states with well-localized position are not affected by the collapse. On the contrary, the off-diagonal terms \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{a}} eq \\\\vec{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}, which are different from zero when a spatial superposition is involved, will decay with a time of decay given by Eq. (). To get an idea of the scale at which the gravitationally induced collapse becomes relevant, one can compute the time of decay in Eq. () for the case of a sphere with radius R_0 and mass m in a spatial superposition at a distance d: = \\\\boldsymbol{a} - \\\\boldsymbol{b}. Then the time of decay can be computed Eq. (23).) using Eq. () with where \\\\lambda = d/(2R_0). To give some examples, if one considers a proton, for which m \\\\simeq 1.67 \\\\times 10^{-27} kg and R_0 \\\\simeq 10^{-15} m, in a superposition with d \\\\gg R_0, one gets \\\\tau_\\\\text{DP} \\\\simeq 10^6 years. On the contrary, for a dust grain with m \\\\simeq 6 \\\\times 10^{-12} kg and R_0 \\\\simeq 10^{-5} m, one gets one gets \\\\tau_\\\\text{DP} \\\\simeq 10^{-8} s. Therefore, contrary to what might be expected considering the weaknesses of gravitational force, the effects of the gravity-related collapse become relevant already at the mesoscopic scale. Recently, the model have been generalized by including dissipative and non-Markovian effects.  Penrose's proposal  It is well known that general relativity and quantum mechanics, our most fundamental theories for describing the universe, are not compatible, and the unification of the two is still missing. The standard approach to overcome this situation is to try to modify general relativity by quantizing gravity. Penrose suggests an opposite approach, what he calls ‚Äúgravitization of quantum mechanics‚Äù, where quantum mechanics gets modified when gravitational effects become relevant. The reasoning underlying this approach is the following one: take a massive system well-localized states in space. In this case, being the state well-localized, the induced space‚Äìtime curvature is well defined. According to quantum mechanics, because of the superposition principle, the system can be placed (at least in principle) in a superposition of two well-localized states, which would lead to a superposition of two different space‚Äìtimes. The key idea is that since space‚Äìtime metric should be well defined, nature ‚Äúdislikes‚Äù these space‚Äìtime superpositions and suppresses them by collapsing the wave function to one of the two localized states. To set these ideas on a more quantitative ground, Penrose suggested that a way for measuring the difference between two space‚Äìtimes, in the Newtonian limit, is where g_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) is the Newtoninan gravitational acceleration at the point where the system is localized around i. The acceleration g_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) can be written in terms of the corresponding gravitationl potentials \\\\Phi_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}), i.e. g_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = - abla\\\\Phi_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}). Using this relation in Eq. (), together with the Poisson equation abla^2\\\\Phi_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = 4\\\\pi G\\\\mu_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}), with \\\\mu_i(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) giving the mass density when the state is localized around i, and its solution, one arrives at The corresponding decay time can be obtained by the Heisenberg time‚Äìenergy uncertainty: which, apart for a factor 8\\\\pi simply due to the use of different conventions, is exactly the same as the time decay \\\\tau_\\\\text{DP} derived by Di√≥si's model. This is the reason why the two proposals are named together as the Di√≥si‚ÄìPenrose model. More recently, Penrose suggested a new and quite elegant way to justify the need for a gravity-induced collapse, based on avoiding tensions between the superposition principle and the equivalence principle, the cornerstones of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In order to explain it, let us start by comparing the evolution of a generic state in the presence of uniform gravitational acceleration \\\\boldsymbol{g}. One way to perform the calculation, what Penrose calls ‚ÄúNewtonian perspective‚Äù, consists in working in an inertial frame, with space‚Äìtime coordinates (\\\\boldsymbol{r}, t) and solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in presence of the potential V(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = m\\\\boldsymbol{g} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{x} (typically, one chooses the coordinates in such a way that the acceleration \\\\boldsymbol{g} is directed along the z axis, in which case V(z) = mgz). Alternatively, because of the equivalence principle, one can choose to go in the free-fall reference frame, with coordinates (\\\\boldsymbol{R}, T) related to (\\\\boldsymbol{r}, t) by \\\\boldsymbol{R} = \\\\boldsymbol{r} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\boldsymbol{g} t^2 and T = t, solve the free Schr√∂dinger equation in that reference frame, and then write the results in terms of the inertial coordinates (\\\\boldsymbol{r}, t). This is what Penrose calls ‚ÄúEinsteinian perspective‚Äù. The solution \\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{r}, t) obtained in the Einsteinian perspective and the one \\\\psi(\\\\boldsymbol{r}, t) obtained in the Newtonian perspective are related to each other by Being the two wave functions equivalent apart for an overall phase, they lead to the same physical predictions, which implies that there are no problems in this situation, when the gravitational field has always a well-defined value. However, if the space‚Äìtime metric is not well defined, then we will be in a situation where there is a superposition of a gravitational field corresponding to the acceleration \\\\boldsymbol{g}_a and one corresponding to the acceleration \\\\boldsymbol{g}_b. This does not create problems as far as one sticks to the Newtonian perspective. However, when using the Einstenian perspective, it will imply a phase difference between the two branches of the superposition given by e^{i\\\\frac{m}{\\\\hbar} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6} (\\\\boldsymbol{g}_a - \\\\boldsymbol{g}_b)^2 t^3 - (\\\\boldsymbol{g}_a - \\\\boldsymbol{g}_b) \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\,t\\\\right)}. While the term in the exponent linear in the time t does not lead to any conceptual difficulty, the first term, proportional to t^3, is problematic, since it is a non-relativistic residue of the so-called Unruh effect: in other words, the two terms in the superposition belong to different Hilbert spaces and, strictly speaking, cannot be superposed. Here is where the gravity-induced collapse plays a role, collapsing the superposition when the first term of the phase \\\\frac{1}{6} (g_a - g_b)^2 t^3 becomes too large. Further information on Penrose's idea for the gravity-induced collapse can be also found in the Penrose interpretation.  Experimental tests and theoretical bounds  Since the Di√≥si‚ÄìPenrose model predicts deviations from standard quantum mechanics, the model can be tested. The only free parameter of the model is the size of the mass density distribution, given by R_0. All bounds present in the literature are based on an indirect effect of the gravitational-related collapse: a Brownian-like diffusion induced by the collapse on the motion of the particles. This Brownian-like diffusion is a common feature of all objective-collapse theories and, typically, allows to set the strongest bounds on the parameters of these models. The first bound on R_0 was set by Ghirardi et al., where it was shown that R_0 > 10^{-15} m to avoid unrealistic heating due to this Brownian-like induced diffusion. Then the bound have been further restricted to R_0 > 4 \\\\times 10^{-14} m by the analysis of the data from gravitational wave detectors. and later to R_0 \\\\gtrsim 10^{-13} m by studying the heating of neutron stars. Regarding direct interferometric tests of the model, where a system is prepared in a spatial superposition, there are two proposals currently considered: an optomechanical setup with a mesoscopic mirror to be placed in a superposition by a laser, and experiments involving superpositions of Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates.

Born in Norfolk, she began writing as a child when illness forced her to be confined for a lengthy period. Travelling often, as a diplomat's daughter she began writing articles as a war correspondent during World War I. She married a wealthy playwright in 1925. As participants in an international social circle, the two travelled widely. Encouraged by her husband, Obermer wrote three plays which were produced in the 1930s in London theatres and was a well known reader on BBC Radio until the 1940s. Between 1936 and 1944, she had a romantic relationship with the painter Gluck, who called Obermer both her wife and her muse. When World War II ended, Obermer and her husband moved to Hawaii, living in Honolulu for the next 20 years. She had long contributed to good causes, often those with educational aims, and continued this work there. She became a painter and participated in both solo and group showings, often using them as fund raisers for charitable causes. In 1969, Obermer moved to Paudex, Switzerland, where she remained until her death in 1984. She was honoured as an officer of the Order of the British Empire and received the Distinguished Women Award from Northwood University for her philanthropy and stature as a role model. The University of Hawaii awards a music scholarship in her name. Early life Ella Ernestine Sawyer was born on 14 September 1893 at Cromer Hall, Norfolk, England to Ethel Maria (n√©e Hulley) and Ernest Edward Sawyer. While young, she was given the nickname Nesta. A sickly child, she suffered from peritonitis caused by tuberculosis, which required hospitalization for a year. While confined, she began writing The Reason of the Beginning and other Imaginings, which was published in 1921. Her father, a career diplomat, was posted to Berne and the family moved to Switzerland during World War I. She wrote articles as a war correspondent from the age of 17 and had an article The Taking of Strasbourg published in The Times. She acted in amateur theatrical productions in the 1920s, and met her future husband through theatrical circles. On 23 April 1925, at St James' Church Sussex Gardens, she married Seymour Obermer, an American playwright living in England. Career Continuing to use her maiden name for the next decade, Sawyer was a society figure known for her charm and style. Together with her husband, who was 30 years older, she led an international existence. The couple lived variously in their home in the English countryside, their flat in London, or their villa at Grasse on the French Riviera. They wintered in Switzerland to take advantage of the sporting events and spent their summers in Venice. Sawyer once claimed that after her marriage she and her husband rarely stayed \\"more than three nights in any one place\\". She was known for her daring, obtaining a pilot's licence against her husband's wishes, and later learning to surf. She also earned competitive gold medals for speed skating and skiing. In 1932, at a dinner party given by Molly, Lady Mount Temple, she met the artist Gluck. With her husband's encouragement, Sawyer began writing plays. Her first production, Black Magic, opened at the Royalty Theatre in London in 1931. It was staged in 1935 by the Theatre Guild in New York City and adapted for television, airing in 1938. Her second play So Good, So Kind was presented in 1933 at the Playhouse Theatre, as was Little White Lies, which opened the autumn season. She also read dramas, poems, and comedies on BBC Radio throughout the 1930s and 1940s. During this same period, Sawyer's relationship with Gluck intensified. On 25 May 1936, Gluck confided to her diary that the two were married, had exchanged rings, and the date became their anniversary. Their affair lasted until 1944 and was marked by the creation of Medallion, which Gluck called the YouWe Picture. It is a dual portrait of Gluck and Sawyer, inspired by their attendance in 1936 of Fritz Busch's production of Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. Gluck acknowledged Sawyer as her one great love and her inspiration, saving the letters that they had written in a shoebox, which was discovered after her death. The Obermers were involved in many charitable works and organized events to benefit the Heritage Craft Schools for Crippled Children. Both of them served on the board of trustees and used connections with influential friends to help with fund raising. She also provided financial support to the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Amnesty International, and other educational programmes. During the war, she served on the Plumpton Civil Defence transporting the wounded to nearby hospitals. She made recordings to allow visually impaired people to listen to the world's great literary works. After the war, for her war-time broadcasts she was honoured as an officer of the Order of the British Empire. In the same period, Obermer's father died and her mother became depressed. To lift her spirits, Obermer asked her mother, who had been a talented watercolourist, to give her painting lessons. Though her mother did not rejuvenate her interest in art, Obermer began oil painting. In 1948, the couple moved to Hawaii, as Obermer's husband had suffered a stroke and he thought the climate might improve his condition. For six years they lived at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel and along with the ex-patriot community made numerous trips to Asia and the Pacific Islands. Obermer continued her philanthropic work, hosting art shows and auctions to fund programmes like the Kuakini Medical Center, Palama Settlement House, and organizations benefiting those with visual impairments. Her works included portraits, which were praised for capturing the characteristics of her subjects, and landscapes of tropical settings, in Hawaii and from her travels to Bali, Fiji, Tahiti, and other places. Obermer at her easel, 1957 In 1954, the couple purchased a home on Diamond Head. Obermer continued to make a name for herself as a painter, exhibiting in both solo showings and with groups of other artists. In 1957, her play Mind Over Matter, a rewrite of Black Magic, was produced on Broadway. That year, Seymour died and she inherited his estate, valued at $668,240 (equivalent to $ or ¬£4,800,000 in ). The Internal Revenue Service taxed her over $46,000 (equivalent to $ or ¬£300,000 in ) in inheritance tax, which she claimed was an overpayment of nearly $25,000 (equivalent to $ or ¬£160,000 in ). Obermer appealed and eventually won a reduction in the tax claim in 1964. That year, an anonymous donor established the Nesta Obermer Chamber Music Scholarship at the University of Hawaii to honour Obermer's long involvement in promoting the arts. In 1969, Obermer moved to Switzerland, settling in Le Tourbillon, a luxury estate in the Canton of Vaud. She continued her social lifestyle, entertaining such notables as Joyce Carey, Diana Menuhin, Graham Payn, Ginette Spanier, Joan Sutherland, as well as Gluck and her new partner Edith Shackleton Heald. In 1972, Obermer helped Gluck mount what would be her last solo exhibit, inviting her personal contacts to ensure its success. In 1978, she was honoured by Northwood University in Midland, Michigan with their Distinguished Women Award for her philanthropy and stature as a role model for women. Death and legacy Obermer died on 3 October 1984 in Paudex, (near Lausanne) in Vaud, Switzerland. The scholarship fund established in her name is still granted by the University of Hawaii. In 2017, the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery hosted an exhibit of Gluck's paintings and personal effects, which included some of their letters and paintings featuring Obermer, such as The Punt (1937). Medallion is considered a seminal work and \\"one of the most famous paintings\\" in the depiction of LGBTQ relationships, according to Gluck's biographers, Amy De La Haye and Martin Pel.

Irving in the dual roles of Lesurques and Dubosc (1906) In Act I we are near Paris in France in 1796 where the audience is introduced to the contrasting lives of the central characters, Joseph Lesurques, a rich and respectable self-made man who arrives in Paris for the wedding of his daughter Julie to her fianc√©, the merchant Didier. While meeting old friends at a caf√© members of the gang of Dubosc, an escaped convict, thief and drunk also gather. After Lesurques leaves Dubosc arrives. He rejects Jeanette, the mother of his child and conspires with his gang to rob the Lyons Mail. Lesurques's innkeeper father Jerome faces bankruptcy but is too proud to ask his son for help, and while he leaves to find a buyer for his inn his son returns and leaves money for him. Dubosc and his gang meet at the inn which is on a lonely stretch of the road by which the Lyons Mail must pass. Here Dubosc makes his arrangements to waylay the Lyons Mail which they rob while murdering the courier, at the same time making off with the money left by Lesurques for his father. When Jerome returns he confronts Dubosc and believes him to be his son but is shot and wounded.Jeffrey Richards, Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World, Hambledon and London (2005) - Google Books pp. 159-160 Act II is set in Lesurques's house in Paris where Julie gives work to Jeanette. Lesurques is wrongly identified by Joliquet the tavern-boy as the robber of the Lyons Mail; he is arrested alongside Courriol and Choppard, two of the real criminals. Jerome believes his son is a member of the criminal gang and offers him a pistol to take the honourable way out, but when Lesurques rejects the offer his father sees him as a coward. In Act III Lesurques is on trial; his daughter Julie wants to call off her engagement to Didier to save him from shame. However, he turns down her offer and produces evidence that demonstrates her father's innocence. Dubosc gets into the house and destroys the evidence stabbing Julie in his escape. Lesurques having been found guilty is in prison awaiting execution when Julie arrives and explains the case of mistaken identity, which is confirmed by Courriol and Choppard. Julie leads the authorities to Dubosc who has taken a room in a tavern to see Lesurques pass by on his way to execution. He is arrested after a violent struggle and Lesurques is released from custody. Act I.

B. Irving in the 1908 revival at the Shaftesbury Theatre The actor John Martin- Harvey, who appeared as Joliquet opposite Irving in the play in the early 1890s, later said of Irving's performance: > Lesurques in his hands bore very little resemblance to a hero in melodrama; > he was typical of all that is implied by 'middle-class respectabilty', > though perhaps a trifle too distinguished, and might have passed for a > younger brother of Doctor Primrose, whom he more nearly resembled than any > other of his impersonations.... I have known the audience 'stagger' on the > first appearance of Dubosc. Lesurques is hardly out of sight when Dubosc is > there in the doorway, grim, sinister, the embodiment of wicked intent. His > accomplices cower as he comes among them with contemptuous, insolent > tolerance. Then, peremptorily, he issues his orders and from that moment > dominates. Martin-Harvey also recalled that to emphasise the cruelty of Dubosc Irving hummed some bars of La Marseillaise while searching the dead body of the courier, on another night shocking the audience by instead humming 'Nearer, My God, to Thee'. 'The effect was appalling,' Martin-Harvey said. '[In the finale] it is hardly possible to exaggerate the savagery of Irving's performance in that scene, yet never did he overstep the truth of nature and degenerate into extravagance. Dubosc though a monster was a credible human being and it was that fact that gave the play its lasting popularity'. Revivals Lesurques is reprieved - H. B. Irving in the 1908 revival at the Shaftesbury Theatre In 1906 Irving's son H. B. Irving revived The Lyons Mail at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London, himself playing the dual roles of Joseph Lesurques and Dubosc, with his wife Dorothea Baird in the cast. > Mr. H.B. lrving's opening night of the Shaftesbury on Thursday was made > historical by the enthusiasm of the audience. Old friends of his > distinguished father and many well-wishers gave him a magnificent \\"send > off.\\" He emerged triumphantly from the ordeal of comparison in the great > twin parts of Lesurques and Dubosc in The Lyons Mail, that picturesque > melodrama which has been given a niche in dramatic fame far above its > deserts by the genius of Irving the elder.

Irving expressed the hope that he had made the play > interesting, both to those to whom it was new and to those who were familiar > with it in the old days at the Lyceum, there was one great shout of \\"You > have\\". The earnestness of the performance could not be resisted, and those > who critically opined that it lacked a trifle in power were overwhelmed. The > new Irving is worthy to play his father's parts.'The New Irving' - Lloyds > Weekly News (London, UK) - 18 October 1908 The actor Bransby Williams (wearing Irving's costumes from the original production) revived The Lyons Mail at the Lyceum Theatre in 1923 followed by that of John Martin Harvey at the Savoy Theatre in 1930.

It was situated to the west of the historic city wall near the banks of the Rhine on what is known today as Schottenstra√üe (Scots Street).  History = Monastery  According to local tradition, the monastery was founded in 1142; however, the first documentary evidence of the monastery‚Äôs existence did not appear until 1220 onwards. There is also no mention of abbots until the late 1260s. It is likely that the monastery was founded by bishops (possibly in an effort to repopulate an old, abandoned monastery) and the first Irish monks probably came from the Saint James Monastery in Regensburg. The monastery, which was placed under the patronage of James the Great, was said by Buzelin to have been founded in 653 and relocated to the Paradies suburb of the city in 701. Frequent documentary proof of the monastery‚Äôs existence would not emerge until the monastery became an abbey in 1245.Joseph Sauer: Die Anf√§nge des Christentums und der Kirche in Baden. In: Neujahrsbl√§tter der Badischen Historischen Kommission, Neue Folge 14, Carl Winters Universit√§tsbuchhandlung, Stuttgart 1911, S. 65. After economically challenging times and due to its small size, the Scots Monastery in Constance was promoted to the rank of pontifical monastery as part of the compulsory introduction of the Rule of Saint Benedict in 1245. After the middle of that century, it was influenced by the Scots Monastery in W√ºrzburg. In around 1518 to 1520, the Saint James Monastery was transferred to Scottish monks, yet due to the influence of the reformation in Constance, the monastery was disbanded shortly thereafter and the buildings were demolished in 1529 and 1530.  Reuse of the grounds  Afterwards, the monastery grounds served as an urban cemetery from 1530 until 1870. The main cemetery in Constance was subsequently relocated to Petershausen (Constance). Today, the Saint James Scots chapel, founded in the year 1589, is located on the monastery grounds. The Alexander von Humboldt Gymnasium was opened in 1903. The Vincentius hospital was in operation from 1888 to 2018 and moved into a new building at the clinical centre in Constance.Philipp Zieger: Wie ein Krankenhaus umzieht. In: S√ºdkurier, 27.

On 30 March the Australian Government announced a $130 billion \\"JobKeeper\\" wage subsidy program. The JobKeeper program would pay employers up to $1500 a fortnight per full-time, part-time or casual employee that has worked for that business for over a year. For a business to be eligible, they must have lost 30% of turnover after 1 March of annual revenue up to and including $1 billion. For businesses with a revenue of over $1 billion, turnover must have decreased by 50%. Businesses are then required by law to pay the subsidy to their staff, in lieu of their usual wages. This response came after the enormous job losses seen just a week prior when an estimated 1 million Australians lost their jobs. This massive loss in jobs caused the myGov website to crash and lines out of Centrelink offices to run hundreds of metres long. The program was backdated to 1 March, to aim at reemploying the many people who had just lost their jobs in the weeks before. Businesses would receive the JobKeeper subsidy for 6 months. The announcement of the JobKeeper wage subsidy program is the largest measure announced by the Australian Government in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak. In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses registered to receive the payments. The JobKeeper wage subsidy program is one of the largest economic packages ever implemented in the history of Australia.

He is a Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Associate Dean of Community and Minority Affairs. He has worked on the health of people from ethnic minority backgrounds, with a focus on sexually transmitted infections and HIV.  Early life and education  Fullilove was born to Robert Fullilove, a physician, and Helen Fullilove. Fullilove's grandfather was from Yazoo City, Mississippi, and was one of the first Black physicians in the area. Fullilove attended the Pingry School. In 1966, he earned a B.A. in philosophy and religion from Colgate University. In 1972, Fullilove earned a M.S. in instructional technology from Syracuse University. In 1984, Fullilove earned Ed.D. in higher and adult education and statistics from the Teachers College, Columbia University, where he studied the educational opportunities of students in New Jersey. Career While in college, Fullilove was part of voter registration efforts in Mississippi as part of the Mississippi Freedom Summer. In 1969 Fullilove joined the faculty State University of New York cooperative college centre, before moving to the University of California, Berkeley as a research associate. Fullilove started working on HIV/AIDS prevention in the 1980s, when 1 in 5 of Americans living with HIV were African American. As the HIV spread around the United States, Nixon's creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration meant that people of colour were disproportionately being locked up in prison. Fullilove has argued that drug abuse is first and foremost a public health challenge, and should not be treated as a criminal justice issue. By locking up people who were most likely to suffer from HIV, the spread of HIV/AIDS accelerated both in prisons and in the communities that prisoners returned to. Fullilove has argued that society, and particularly mass incarceration, allowed HIV/AIDS to disproportionally impact people from minority backgrounds. In 1995 he joined the National Academy of Medicine (then Institute of Medicine) on the Board of the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention committee. He has served on various committees for the National Academy of Medicine, including those which focus on substance abuse and addition. He joined Columbia University in 1990 and was promoted to Professor of Sociomedical Sciences in 2004. From 2010 he started to teach public health in several New York State prisons through the Bard College Prison Initiative. Whilst the programme started with only 15 students, by 2015 there were almost 300 registered each year. He has continued to suppor the programme throughout his career, eventually being made a Senior Advisor. Looking back on a decade of the initiative, Fullilove said \\"the success of this program in creating college graduates committed to pursuing careers in public health cannot be underestimated\\". During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fullilove became concerned that coronavirus disease would easily be transmitted around prisons and homeless shelters.

Holloway engages with the rhetoric of technology and sexuality to excavate the hidden architectures of power structures and gender norms.. Early life and education Holloway was born in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. From 2008 to 2010, Holloway attended Shimer College where she studied social science. In 2013, Holloway received a B.F.A. in studio art from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 2016, Holloway received an M.F.A. in design and technology from Parsons Paris. Career Alongside her art practice, Holloway is also a teacher in the New Arts Journalism and Film Video New Media and Animation departments at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), a sex educator teaching classes and writing about intersectional approaches to exploring kinks, and the founder of STRAPP, a design collaborative that re-imagines adult novelty products.. She has spoken and exhibited work internationally in spaces like The New School and Eyebeam in New York, Helsinki‚Äôs Sorbus Galleria, and ICA London, as well as the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Her work has been acknowledged by sector experts such as Rhizome (organization) and Holloway has been invited to numerous national and international artist-in-residence programs, such as Lean Artist, and curator-in-residence programs, including the dgtl fmnsm festival in Dresden, Germany in 2018. Selected works * text(s) to screen (2015): Holloway‚Äôs series of digital collages addresses charged themes of desire, rejection, and abuse in the age of ubiquitous online dating. Part of a presentation at Fotomuseum Winterthur in 2019, the curator wrote about the series: \\"Holloway creates highly charged digital collages by placing excerpts from instant-messaging chats with lovers alongside images that could be from the world of advertising, stock photo databanks or Word ClipArt. Viewers are drawn into a fictional quest for traces ‚Äì be they erotic, ironic, or aggressive ‚Äì that brings no conclusive interpretation of the scenes portrayed.\\" * Chambers Series (2017‚Äìpresent): An ongoing series of performance scores and their partner publication, Chamber Series explores the dynamics of BDSM acts and, in particular, puppy play (or animal roleplay). Inspired, in part, by Donna Haraway‚Äôs book The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness, the publications \\"ask readers to consider how proximity, deprivation, yearning, generosity, and need guide and manipulate our relationships to others.\\" * Extreme Submission (2017): A series developed during Holloway's time in Paris, working on her Masters at The New School, Parsons School of Design, Extreme Submission (2016) is a project that deals with her identity as a queer woman of color in the BDSM community. As described by Sandra Song in an article for Paper Magazine, the project is composed of three separate works (\\"Extreme Submission Validated,\\" \\"Preritual Status\\" and \\"Using Tools That Use You\\"), and \\"addresses ideas surrounding power dynamics, sexuality and intimacy -- and how it all fits into the endless creative possibilities of the Internet.\\" * Sub Not Slave (2017): is a multimedia installation that creatively re-stages a sex club bathroom to guide the viewer into an examination of the power that exists between bodies and within interpersonal, sexual relationships. In an interview about the project on AQNB, Holloway explained about the exhibition \\"I placed them [the audience] in the dominant moral position, but enticed them to do what I wanted. I topped from the bottom. But really, it is all a mirror. When you look down at me, you look down at yourself.\\" * STRAPP: As a part of LEAN ARTIST, the world's first seed accelerator for artists founded by Jeremy Bailey, STRAPP was created in Fall 2017 as a hybrid performance / product design experiment under the guidance of an international team of mentors and later exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Strapp is an ongoing project to initiate a step forward for queer sexuality. From the website: \\"shawn√© michaelain founded Strapp to evolve the narrative of sexuality for a new generation of individuals seeking confidence and comfort without compromise.\\" The project was covered by Vice Magazine in 2019; in the interview Holloway explained ‚ÄúMy practice is about examining the tools with which we communicate, what powers go into designing those tools, and how design impacts us while we're using them.‚Äù Selected exhibitions * 2013: The Photographic Self, Woman Made Gallery, New York * 2015: Real Live Online, New Museum, New York * 2015-2019: States of Incarceration, Traveling / The New School, Humanities Action Lab * 2017: Post-Cyber Feminist International, Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London * 2018: A Recollection.
