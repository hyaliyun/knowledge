It officially separated from the Province of Saint Nicholas de Tolentine on 28 November 1998. Today, the Provincialate House is located at the San Nicolas De Tolentino Parish Church on Neptune Street, Congressional Subdivision, Project 6, Quezon City. The arrival of the Recollects in the Philippines Though the province was only created in 1998, the Recollect Mission came to Philippine soils quite early in its history. Just 17 years after the Recollection was formed in the Chapter of Toledo, 10 priests and 4 consecrated brothers sailed to the Philippines in order to heed the request of the Archbishop of Manila to help in the Christianization of the islands. And with their arrival on 12 May 1606 at the island of Cebu, they became the fifth order to be stalwarts of Philippine evangelization. Together with the Augustinians (who arrived first in 1575), the discalced Franciscans (1578), the Jesuits (1581) and the Dominicans (1587), they performed the heroic task of not only Christianizing the Philippines but also to lay the foundations of many of its modern-day towns and cities. The first Recoletos The first Recollect mission to the Philippines was led by no less than the very first Prior Provincial Fray Juan de San Jer√≥nimo. Together with him was Fr. Rodrigo de San Miguel, a man well versed not only in theology but in other sciences as well. Unfortunately, Fr. Andr√©s de San Nicol√°s did not make it to his destination but died at sea. The first priories Though they first set foot on the island of Cebu in 1606, the Recoletos built their first priory in the same year in Bagumbayan outside the walls of the present-day Intramuros. The house is still preserved by the national government until today, though it is in an uninhabitable state. The priory was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and became one of the centers of devotion to Our Lady of Health for many years. Three years later, they founded another house within the walls which became their Provincial House until the end of World War II. It was dedicated to St. Nicolas de Tolentino, an Italian visionary and Patron Saint of the souls in Purgatory and of mariners. In 1616, they also founded a house in Cavite and went back to Cebu in 1621 to found yet another one. In the same year, they also began constructing the order's most prominent sanctuary in history, the Minor Basilica of San Sebastian. Missionary activities=Philippine missions In reality, the Recollection was not meant to be active. The Fifth Determination of the Chapter of Toledo was clear that the original motive of its creation was to be more contemplative.Chapter of Toledo 5th Determination, 'Since there are among us, or at least may be, some who have greater love for monastic perfection and want to follow a more austere plan of life, we ought to favour their legitimate desire by not placing obstacles to the Holy Spirit; having previously consulted our most Reverend Father General and implored his leave, we determine that in our Province three or more monasteries of men and as many of women be designated or established; in them a more austere kind of life is to be practised; its manner is to be regulated, after mature reflection, by the Father Provincial with his Definitorum.' Their main plan was to live more radically their life of prayer and community. Because of this, their original priories were not parishes but contemplative houses. However, the difference in setting of the Philippines was so different that the missionaries in the Philippines needed to have a more active role. Filipinos flocked to their doors every Sunday to attend the Holy Mass and they had no choice but to open their doors. In 1607, they were officially given the charge to Christianize the towns of Bagac, Bataan. They also founded in the same year a community in Masinloc, Zambales, which is considered their first real parish. And finally, at the end of the decade (1609), they also were made in charge of Bolinao, Pangasinan. On 1 March 1621, the colonial government divided the island of Mindanao into two. The northeastern section of the island was given to the Recollects while the rest was given to the Jesuits. Their most prominent area was in Butuan City, Cateel, Davao Oriental and the Dinagat Islands. However, during the Jesuit Expulsion, the task was left solely on their shoulders. Also, on 1621, the Recollects were given the northern Cebu as part of their mission. Perhaps, the province that carries the heaviest imprints of the Recollect mission is the island of Negros (now divided into Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental). Given to them in 1626, the Recollects not only founded parishes but also the very towns they have today. Today, most of the names of their towns bear the same names as those of Spain, mainly those areas where the missionaries came from. Other areas that were given to them were the islands of Romblon, Banton and Tablas in 1635. The Recollect missionaries from Mexico brought along with them the image of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salud which, according to Fr. Rommel L. Rubia, ‚Äúwas a precious gift from the Discalced (Barefoot) Carmelite nuns of Mexico to the Recollect missionaries on their way to their missions in the Philippines‚Äù. Mindoro was added to their charge in 1679 and eight years later, the island of Masbate. Finally, they were also given some areas in the present-day Quezon Province in 1658. In 1712, the Governor-General Martin Ursua y Arizmendi, ordered the establishment of the towns along Pampanga - Pangasinan route to secure travelers from Aeta and Zambal raids. Incidentally, in the same year, the spiritual administration of the Zambales was restored to the Augustinian Recollects after a prolonged dispute with the Dominicans. The Recollects opposed the governor‚Äôs order because of the inherent difficulty of its execution. But the governor insisted. He even invoked the name of the King in his second request and order. The Recollects bowed in obedience. They sent the best devout missionaries to start the missions. Soon, the towns of Mabalacat and Panipoan or Bamban and Capas were established. A Philippine census in 1734 undertaken by the Catholic Church surveyed that the Recollects are present in 19 dioceses in \\"Mindoro, Caraga, Bisaya and Calamianes towns with 53,384 souls.‚Äù By 1898, the year that the Filipinos declared independence from Spain, the Recollects were attending to about 1,203,399 souls in 203 towns and 20 provinces in the Philippines.Historia de la Iglesia en Hispanoam√©rica y Filipinas Vol. II (p.712), Isacio Rodr√≠guez; Madrid 1992. Foreign missions The Recollect missionaries in the Philippines did not content themselves with Christianizing the Philippines. They also embarked on an ambitious mission to other areas, most notably in Japan. Despite the scarcity of resources, they began an arduous mission to the said country 1623. The mission was begun by Spanish Fr. Francisco de Jes√∫s and the Portuguese Fr. Vicente Carvalho and sowed the seeds of Christianity in Unzen, in the island of Kyushu. Their mission blessed the order with its very first martyrs in Japan. The two priests were subjected to slow fire on 3 September 1623. Their fate was repeated in the person of Fr. Melchor de San Agust√≠n and Fr. Mart√≠n de San Nicol√°s in 1632. However, before the two died, they were able to give some catechetical instruction to a young girl named Magdalene in the Prefecture of Nagasaki. She later became a member of the Tertiary and became the order's very first saint. Given that the Spanish dominions over the Pacific were under the management of the Captaincy General of the Philippines, the province also sent missions to some of the islands of the Marianas. Presently, the Philippine province is also in charge of the mission in Taiwan and Sierra Leone. Other related organizations=Augustinian Recollect Sisters Founded by the Dionisia Talangpaz and her sister Cecilia Rosa Talangpaz on 16 July 1728, the Augustinian Recollect Sisters is the second oldest congregation in the Philippines after the Religious of the Virgin Mary. It also holds the honor of being the third oldest congregation founded in Asia. It was originally an organization of Tertiaries but later on developed into a full congregation. The congregation is perpetually united to the Order of Augustinian Recollects in many ties. It is one of the active congregations belonging to the Augustinian Recollects family and a fruit brought forth out of the missionary zeal of the Order. The primitive Augustinian Recollect Fathers guided the two foundresses and the first community of beatas. They directed the Beaterio from its earlier stage of growth and development until it was canonically erected as a diocesan religious congregation on 19 August 1929 through the recommendation of the Reverend Father Gerardo Larrondo, the incumbent Prior General of the Recollect Friars; and through the benevolence of the Most Reverend Michael O'Doherty, then, Archbishop of Manila. Still with the nurturing assistance of the Augustinian Recollect Order, juridical autonomy was procured for the congregation which subsequently was declared an Institute of Pontifical Right by the Holy See on 20 November 1970, under the pontificate of Pope Paul VI. The Secular Augustinian Recollect Fraternity The Secular Augustinian Recollect Fraternity is the Third Order or Tertiary of the Order of Augustinian Recollects. Founded as early as the 1650s in the town of Bolinao, Pangasinan, these pious men and women share in the charism of the Recoletos in their daily lives. In fact, the history of the Secular Augustinian Recollects is so fruitful in the province that it is from this province that the first martyr and saint of the order came in the person of Magdalene of Nagasaki. Aside from this wondrous saint, the Secular Augustinian Recollect was also blessed with other heroic people like Calara Calima and Isabel. In fact, the modern-day Augustinian Recollect Sisters were members of the SARF during their earlier times. Today, with more than 400 members scattered all over the archipelago, the Philippines Tertiaries are the second most numerous both in terms of nationality and provincial affinity. Recollect Augustinian Youth Considered the Fourth Order, this organization aims to form the modern youth with the spirituality of Saint Augustine. Recollect Augustinian Youth aims to pray for the saints, the religious men and women, and also the priest. They also preach about vocations and the true essence of St. Augustine and its works. OAR and education Aside from administering parishes, the OAR, in another good way to further help the Philippines, is to educate their people. Therefore, the Recollects began founding learning institutions as well. Scattered all over the country, these institutions are considered to be one of the centers of learning in their respective areas. Institutions with university status *University of Negros Occidental - Recoletos ‚Äì fondly called as UNO-Recoletos or simply UNO-R, the school was founded in 1941 in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, and later moved to its present location in Bacolod. It is the first institution in the city and in the province. It was elevated to university status on May 15, 1957. Though not actually founded by the Recollects, the management was transferred to them on May 25, 1962 with Fr. Federico Terradillos, OAR as its first rector. The school patron is San Nicol√°s de Tolentino, the patron of souls in Purgatory. *University of San Jose - Recoletos ‚Äì also known as USJ-R. Founded in 1947, it is one of Cebu's centers of learning. It received university status on September 21, 1984 and by 2001, it was granted autonomy by the Commission on Higher Education. Also in 2003, it was granted Level 3 accreditation by the PAASCU. It has 3 campuses within the island of Cebu and the school patron is St. Ezekiel Moreno. Institutions with college status *San Sebastian College - Recoletos de Manila ‚Äì founded in 1941, it remains the only Recollect institution in Metro Manila. It also has a satellite campus in Canlubang, Laguna. Baste, as it is fondly called by its students, is most popularly known because of its 5-year consecutive win in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. It also remains as one of the main institutions of learning for law. *San Sebastian College - Recoletos de Cavite ‚Äì though bearing the same name, the institution in Cavite City developed separately from that of Manila. Founded in 1966 as an all-male school, it opened its doors to accept women in 1986. Institutions offering secondary programs *Colegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos ‚Äì established in 1940 in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental *Colegio San Nicolas de Tolentino - Recoletos ‚Äì formerly called the UNO-R High School Talisay Branch, it was previously a satellite high school campus of the University of Negros Occidental - Recoletos until it got separated and established as an independent school. It is located in Talisay City, Negros Occidental. *San Pedro Academy - Recoletos ‚Äì located at Barangay Caidiocan, Valencia, Negros Oriental *San Pedro Academy - Recoletos ‚Äì located at Barangay Poblacion, Valencia, Negros Oriental Seminaries and theological houses *Santo Tomas de Villanueva Recoletos Formation House ‚Äì the order's Minor Seminary located in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental *Casiciaco Recoletos Seminary ‚Äì also called the Seminario Mayor - Recoletos de Baguio and offers philosophy in Baguio *Recoletos Formation Center ‚Äì the Theology House in Mira-Nila Homes, Quezon City *San Ezequiel Moreno Novitiate ‚Äì Recoletos - the novitiate house in Antipolo, Rizal Notable Recoletos who worked in the province=Recollect saints *Saint Ezequi√©l Moreno y D√≠az (9 April 1848 - 19 August 1906) - patron of the province. Born in Alfaro, La Rioja, Spain, the saint arrived in the Philippines on 10 February 1870. He was ordained a priest by the Archbishop of Manila, the Most Reverend Gregorio Melit√≥n Mart√≠nez on 2 June 1871. He was missionary to many of the archipelago, most notably in Palawan where he founded the Cathedral of the Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa. He was later sent to Colombia where he was appointed as bishop of Pasto. *Saint Magdalene of Nagasaki - *Martyrs of Motril - Recollect martyrs *Reverend Father Agust√≠n Mi√±o - first missionary to Bataan and Zambales. Considered the Recollect proto-martyr of the Philippines. Other notable Recoletos * Archbishop Jos√© Aranguren - first Recollect Archbishop of Manila who reigned from 19 January 1846 to 18 April 1861. * Br. Mat√≠as Carbonel (1806‚Äì1861) - built the Isabel II Bridge in Imus, Cavite which is still being used until now. * Fr. Diego Cera - former Parish Priest of San Jos√© Parish in Las Pi√±as. He is known as the mind behind the construction of the famous Bamboo Organ, which is still in a very good state until now. The parish attracts an international audience every February through its Bamboo Organ Festival.

The centre of Fowey is some distant, whilst Par railway station is less than away. Polmear used to be known as East Polmear and West Polmear is now known as Charlestown, and has been since Charles Rashleigh built the harbour there (1791 to 1798). The first four Rashleigh Almshouses in Polmear were originally built c. 1653 when Jonathan Rashleigh was granted leaveCornwall Records Office Ref. R/5128 to build housing for four poor persons from Tywardreath. Each cottage had one room with a large fireplace and a platform reached by ladder to sleep on, and they shared a water pump and a privy out the back. There are records accounting for the food and clothing given to the widows between 1745 and 1850, records of an \\"abstract of deeds\\" in the 18th century, information of the rules for 'inmates' c. 1820 and other records held at the Cornwall Records Office.Cornwall Records Office Ref.

The cottages were sold by the Rashleigh Estate to the Cornwall Buildings Preservation Trust in 1977 and rebuilt by the Cornwall Buildings Preservation Trust in 1977/78, at which time the seven almshouses were converted into three cottages, and are listed grade II, once rebuilt they were then sold on and are now each privately owned. The adjacent Ship Inn dates from the early 18th century and is still owned by the Rashleighs. Polmear is situated at the junction of two long distance footpaths. The South West Coast Path follows the coast of south west England from Somerset to Dorset, and in the immediate vicinity crosses Par Sands before following the cliff tops to the nearby cove and hamlet of Polkerris. The Saints' Way crosses from the north coast to the south coasts of Cornwall, and takes a more direct inland route from Polmear to Fowey. The trackbed of the former Par to Fowey branch of the Cornwall Minerals Railway passes through Polmear, crossing the A3082 on a bridge.

Its regulation was later modified and completed by the Supreme Soviet's decree of 22 August 1988. It was conferred by the Supreme Soviet's presidency on behalf of the Ministry of Health. A diploma of the Supreme Soviet's presidency was given to those who were appointed People's Doctor jointly with the medal and its concerning certificate. The title could be bestowed to individual medical doctors and nurses but also to health care structures as general hospitals, sanatoriums, maternity wards or preventive medicine centres. The awarded people or structures were selected for their worthwhile contributions to public health improvement, for their peculiar skills and expertise and for having proved abnegation and high moral qualities in their duties fulfilment. Following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the title did not disappear. On 30 December 1995, by a decree of the Russian presidency, it was created the new title of Meritorious Doctor of the Russian Federation. The title was first bestowed on 9 August 1978, when five people were awarded: * Viktor Nikolayevich Vasilenko * Lyudmila Vasilievna Yevstratova * Viktor Mikhailovich Ilin * Lyudmila Nilolayevna Mikhailova * Zagipa Madievna Madiyeva The last doctor to be praised was Dr. Vitaly Prokopievich Sergeyev from Osh (Kirghiz SSR), whom the medal was conferred on 20 December 1991.  Design  The medal was made of tombac and its shape was roughly quadrangular (22.5 x 23.5 mm). The central part was occupied by the inscription \\"–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –≤—Ä–∞—á –°–°–°–†\\" (People's Doctor of the USSR) on three lines and below, on the left, the Bowl of Hygieia medical symbol and, on the right, a bay laurel branch. Symbols and inscriptions were embossed, with convex letters. The medal was suspended to a single red silk fringe (18 mm x 21 mm) to whom it was attached by a metallic buckle bearing the hammer and sickle symbol.

G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon, is a 2010 television drama written by Mark Gatiss, directed by Damon Thomas, that stars Gatiss as Cavor and Rory Kinnear as Bedford, with Alex Riddell, Peter Forbes, Katherine Jakeways, Lee Ingleby and Julia Deakin. The First Men on the Moon was first broadcast on 19 October 2010 on BBC Four. It is an adaptation of H. G. Wells' 1901 science fiction novel of the same name. This is the third collaboration between Thomas and Gatiss (after The Worst Journey In The World and Crooked House), and the first film to be produced by their production company Can Do Productions. Plot In July 1969, 90-year- old Julius Bedford (Rory Kinnear) tells young Jim (Alex Riddell) the story of two men who made the first journey to the Moon in 1909. He relates that when he was a young man, he met Professor Arthur Cavor (Mark Gatiss) at Apuldram. Cavor had invented \\"Cavorite\\", a substance that blocked the force of gravity. Bedford encouraged Cavor to think of the profits his invention might bring, and they worked together to build a cast iron sphere that would fly them both to the Moon. After landing on the lunar surface and discovering its oxygen atmosphere is frozen into the surface and released in direct sunlight, the two explorers are captured with nets and taken underground by the Moon's inhabitants (whom Cavor names Selenites). Upon their revival, Cavor and Bedford are fed and try to communicate with the Moon creatures, but to no avail. They are prodded with long poles toward the edge of a lunar abyss. They find themselves in a perilous state after Bedford reacts to the threat and accidentally kills several Selenites with his greater strength. They split up, and Cavor remains behind to give Bedford time to escape. Bedford stumbles through various tunnels and comes upon their spacecraft, which the Selenites brought underground during their captivity. He climbs aboard and activates the controls. Bedford nearly crashes the sphere into the Sun, but recovers and much later lands near the seaside close to home at West Wittering. His hopes of returning to the Moon to rescue Cavor are dashed when a passer-by, Chessocks (Lee Ingleby), climbs aboard and accidentally takes off into space with the hatch open. Bedford does not know how to produce Cavorite, so another sphere cannot be built. Cavor remains in captivity and teaches the Selenites English and some of mankind's history; he also teaches them the formula for Cavorite. The Selenites conclude from hearing about the warlike nature of humankind that the species is a threat to the Moon, and they determine to use Cavorite to make a pre-emptive strike with spacecraft similar to the one that brought Cavor and Bedford from Earth. In desperation, Cavor communicates his intentions in Morse code to Bedford via wireless, and later releases all the Cavorite produced by the Selenites. This causes the Moon's internal and frozen surface atmosphere to escape into space. As a result, the Moon's surface is reduced to a wasteland. This is the barren landscape that is discovered by the Apollo astronauts when the Apollo 11 lunar lander sets down on the Moon's surface; a sole Selenite observes the Earth spacecraft from a distance.

It's very rare to be able to adapt a genius like H. G. Wells for the small screen and we hope to do full justice to his extraordinary vision.\\" The crew mention spacesuits (called \\"suits\\") being on board the sphere, but these spacesuits are never seen, described or used, unlike in the 1964 film. Because the Moon has a breathable atmosphere, no spacesuits are needed. The film ends with a tribute to Lionel Jeffries, who played Cavor in the 1964 feature film, and who died in 2010. Broadcast The First Men in the Moon was first broadcast on 19 October 2010 at 21:00 on BBC Four and was repeated on 20 October 2010 at 00:30 on both BBC Four and BBC HD. It was made available on BBC iPlayer for a period of 7 days until 26 October 2010. Following the original broadcast BBC Four repeated BBC Two's biographical drama H. G. Wells: War with the World starring Michael Sheen as H.G. Wells, the author of The First Men in the Moon. The title of the film is a reference to Wells' best known novel The War of the Worlds.  Reception  The show received generally positive reviews, with criticisms focusing on the story, pacing, and special effects. The Guardians Tim Dowling found Gatiss' adaptation to have \\"brilliant\\" elements, such as setting the film as the 60-year-old \\"kinematographic\\" recording and recollections of an old man (Bedford), told in 1969. This \\"neat framing device\\" presents the story as \\"alternative history\\" which is \\"remarkably faithful\\" to H.G. Wells' original story, treating it \\"playfully, but ... more or less in earnest.\\" He enjoyed the film's \\"sly\\" references to modernity, such as airline flight safety announcements, and its \\"Pooterish approximation of Neil Armstrong's famous words: 'What is this for us, but a tiny footfall.'\\" Dowling found that once on the Moon, \\"the drama hits a soggy spot\\", the Selenite inhabitants \\"are a little unconvincing,\\" and when the duo are separated, \\"the narrative runs out of steam,\\" but wrote that \\"it's worth staying on,\\" and summed up the film as an \\"engaging slice of time travel.\\"Dowling, Tim (19 October 2010). \\"TV review: The First Men in the Moon\\". The Guardian, (UK). The Independents reviewer Tom Sutcliffe wrote: \\"Is there anything deader than science fiction that has been overtaken by science fact? I suppose there might be objections to this rule, but I'm not sure that H.G. Wells's The First Men in the Moon is one of them, despite the affectionate treatment it was given.\\" While noting the film's \\"neat framing device\\" of being set on the same day of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Sutcliffe described the film's special effects as \\"not a great deal more advanced\\" than those of Georges M√©li√®s. In sum, he found the film \\"very nicely done, but uncertain as to why.\\"Sutcliffe, Tom (20 October 2010). Last Night's TV - Tormented Lives, BBC1; The First Men in the Moon, BBC4.

Founded in Ilkeston in 2008, the company doubled its capacity and moved to Giltbrook in 2010. It produces award-winning beers, including Ape Ale and Guerrilla Porter. It currently has four outlets; The Organ Grinder Nottingham, The Organ Grinder Loughborough, The Organ Grinder Newark and The Coffee Grinder Arnold  History  Blue Monkey Brewery was founded in the Manners Industrial Estate, Ilkeston on 8 October 2008 by John Hickling, with a capacity of ten barrels. Prior to the brewery venture, Hickling worked in an IT for ten years, for HBOS banking and insurance company. He was well-paid, and considered it a \\"job for life\\", but found it unsatisfying. He considered various alternative career paths, but the idea of running a brewery stuck with him, and when he reached 30 years of age, he decided to try it, and quit his job to start the brewery. He attended the specialist Brewlab faculty at the University of Sunderland for a course in brewing, and then offered to work for free at breweries to gain experience. He began working for Jarrow Brewery. In 2008, Jarrow Brewery ceased beer production at the Robin Hood pub in Jarrow, South Tyneside, moving operations to the Maltings pub in South Shields. The Robin Hood was retained as their corporate headquarters, storage and distribution. Hickling purchased the brewing plant apparatus from Jarrow, to set up his own brewery in a unit in the Ilkeston industrial park. He tried out 22 brews, before selecting one for the launch. The first beer, Original, was the best-selling beer at a Nottingham beer festival, selling 1,224 pints in under three days. It was a modest 3.6% ABV. Initially, they brewed beer once per week. Working 12-hour shifts, Hickling said that his new career was \\"a real contrast. I've found I've had jobs in the past which were nice, comfortable office jobs. There was a point last year where I was down on my hands and knees scrubbing a drain thinking 'hang on what have I done with my life'?\\" However, the business grew quickly, with demand outstripping the supply capabilities. Their first public appearance was at the 2008 Robin Hood Beer Festival in Nottingham. The following year, at the same festival, the company unveiled Guerilla Porter, exactly one year to the day after the company launch. It was declared the annual champion beer by the Midlands in the Society for Independent Brewers, after winning in the porters, strong milds, old ales and stouts categories. Ape Ale was awarded a bronze medal in the strong bitters category. The festival is sponsored by the Nottingham branch of CAMRA; Spyke Golding, the chairman, said of Guerilla \\"Unlike some stouts it's not overly heavy and it's not cloying.\\" By mid-2009, they had delivered beer to over 100 establishments. An extra fermenter was installed in 2009, raising production to around 9000 pints per week. By the end of 2009, they were shipping 40,000 pints per month, and expanded production capacity to 20 barrels. The company needed larger premises, and in 2010 it relocated to the Giltbrook Industrial Park, in Pentrich Road, just behind the Giltbrook Retail Park, a ¬£70m shopping complex which opened in 2008. The site is capable of producing approximately 100,000 pints per month. The new location is very close to the site of the former Kimberley Brewery, which was the last independent brewery in Nottinghamshire before its closure in 2006. Blue Monkey Brewery is a member of the Derbyshire Brewers' Collective.  Beers  Original, the first beer, is a 3.6%ABV amber or copper coloured session ale, \\"packed full of flavour\\". Beers include Ape ale, Guerilla Porter (a stout), BG Sips, Red Baboons, and Evolution. Guerrilla Porter is 4.9% ABV. Organ Grinder, 4.6% ABV, and Guerilla, 4.9% ABV, were both launched at the Robin Hood festival in October 2009. Organ Grinder is a \\"copper coloured ale, with a duo of unusual hops from New Zealand to give it an interesting twist.\\" 99 Red Baboons is 4.2% ABV, and described by CAMRA as \\"An unusual combination of fruity hoppyness with a dark, malty side.\\" 99 has been described as hard to definitively categorize as either a porter or a mild, being an \\"unusual combination of fruity hoppiness with a dark, malty side\\" which is Simians Summer, 3.6%ABV, is an amber bitter, and was on sale in September 2010. Amarillo is 3.9% abv, and according to CAMRA it is a Gold coloured beer with a white head. Citrus aroma with fruity, hoppy notes. Hints of orange & peach\\". Ape Ale has an abv of 5.4%, described by CAMRA as \\"A complex and sophisticated IPA, using assertive American hops. Aromas of resinous pine & orange.\\" Ape Ale contains American hop varieties, including Simcoe and Chinook. It has \\"Aromas of resinous pine, orange and just the right level of citrussiness. A dry finish and moderate bitterness\\". B. G. Sips, at 4% abv, is a \\"Pale, intensely hoppy bitter with a peppery bitterness\\" according to CAMRA. BG Sips was awarded a gold medal at the 2009 Peterborough Beer Festival in the category 'best beer from a new brewery'. Peterborough beer festival is the second largest in the country. The beer is described by Hickling as \\"pale, hoppy and weak enough that it's not going to knock you out\\". Peterborough beer festival is the second largest in the country. The \\"BG\\" stands for \\"Brewers Gold\\", which is a variety of hops. The beer contains other hop varieties, giving it \\"tropical fruit aromas and peppery bitterness\\". It has a pale golden colour. Evolution was produced in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. Evolution is pale ale, and has a light golden colour. It contains Northdown, Goldings and Styrian Goldings varieties of hops. It has a \\"pronounced citrus aroma that leads onto a lingering bitterness and dry finish\\". Sanctuary is brewed only for two specific establishments--the Hand and Heart and The Roundhouse, both in Nottingham town centre. Their beers are sold in local pubs, with one of the first regular customers being The Waggon and Horses in Bleasby. Other customers include the Three Tuns in Eastwood, the Larks Nest in Nuthall, and Guitar Bar in Sherwood Rise, the Flowerpot in Derby and the Dewdrop in Ilkeston itself; it is also distributed nationally. For the opening ceremony of the new premises in Giltbrook, a special stronger version of Evolution was produced, called Revolution.  Name  Hickling says he spent months trying to think of a name for the enterprise, and then the idea of \\"blue monkey\\" came to him in a dream; however locally the term \\"blue monkeys\\" used to describe the blue flames produced by the nearby Stanton Ironworks factory, which were once visible in the area . Hickling's grandfather, Tom Hickling, worked at the factory throughout his working life. Hickling believes this to be purely coincidental. The 'monkey' in the logo is, in fact, not a monkey, but a chimpanzee which is an ape.

Gameplay Users play as \\"Ms. Lilian Trevithick, lady adventurer and radical steam technician, who has come to the infamous Necropolis of Ao in search of adventure\\". The game presents the action from a top-down perspective. Players explore 25 procedurally-generated levels, looking on each level for treasure, a lever to unlock the stairs to the next level, and then the stairs themselves. At the same time the player tries to avoid harmful spike and steam traps. Players are asked to manage three statistics: Dodge, representing their ability to avoid damage from traps; Detect, representing their ability to discern hidden traps; and Disable, representing their ability to disarm traps to proceed past them. Players also collect health tonics, which can be consumed to restore life energy, and disposable tools, which can be used to disarm traps, as well as a range of equipment which can be used to boost some or all of the three statistics. Gold can also be found, which serves no purpose during the game but acts as a scoring mechanism.

It is the only species of its genus Cymatoceps. It reaches in length and almost in weight. It is found in coastal rocky areas to depths of , and feeds on hard-shelled invertebrates such as crabs and sea urchins. The Head of the black musselcracker is a delicate dish in some areas in India and South Africa. Because the head is well sought after, this species experiences a lot of over harvesting, which diminishes its chances of a stable population. The reason that black musselcracker is vulnerable to over harvesting is mainly because they have a slow growth rate, which means that they are most likely being harvested before they are old enough to reproduce. As a result of over harvesting the black musselcracker, there are now fishing regulations to protect this species. The first rule is that you are only allowed to catch one black musselcracker per person, per day. Also, the black musselcracker must be 50 cm in total length to be able to be kept. Because of these new regulations, in some regions of South Africa, black musselcracker populations are on the rise.

In Martine (1922), perhaps the best example of his work, emotions are implied in gestures, facial expressions, fragments of speech and silence. He was active from 1912 to 1939.

Also, Tingatinga's first name is sometimes spelled \\"Eduardo\\", something that might be related to the arguable claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent; see the \\"Dispute about the origin\\" section. Tingatinga (1932‚Äì1972) was a TanzanianThe issue of Tingatinga's birthplace is the subject of a controversy; see the \\"Dispute about the origin\\" section. painter, best known as the founder of the eponymous painting style and school. Biography=Birth and family Mindu, the nearest village to Namochelia where E. S. Tingatinga was born. Daniel Augusta on motorbike, Mindu (2009) Tingatinga was born in 1932 in a village called Namochelia, in the Tunduru District of Ruvuma Region in southern Tanzania, near the border with northern Mozambique. He knew there were no professionals at this job where he lived, So he decided to take a risk and he did. The risk worked and he was very happy. A village by that name Chicken; it may have ceased to exist in the 1960s as a consequence of the relocation of small villages that was part of the Ujamaa program of President Julius Nyerere. Today's settlements in that area include Mindu, Nakapanya and Mtonya. Many members of Edward Tingatinga's family (on the mother's side) still live in those villages; relatives from the father's side live in Ngapa, about 20 km north of Nakapanya. Edward Tingatinga was born from a poor family. His mother, Agnes Binti Ntembo, belonged to the Makua ethnic group and was a Christian, while his father, Saidi Tingatinga, was a Ngindo and a Muslim. This is why the child was given both a Christian name (Edward) and a Muslim name (Saidi). Because of the matrilinear heritage of the Makua traditional society, Edward Tingatinga should be considered of Makua descent. As a child, he was mostly cared for by his mother's family. Eventually, the relationship between Agnes Ntembo and Saidi Tingatinga broke down. Agnes Ntembo had three more sons with two other partners, namely Andrea Gallusi, Simon Mpata and Cesilia Mpata. Simon Mpata, as well as Agnes Mpata (Cesilia's daughter) would later follow Edward's footsteps and join the society of painters he would found. Career In the 1950s, Edward left his mother and went to work in the plantations of sisal in Tanga Region of northern Tanzania; later, he was invited by his uncle Salum Mussa Mkayoga (also known as Mzee Lumumba), who worked as a cook of a British officer in Dar es Salaam. Tingatinga found favour with him and was employed as gardener. At the same time he began experimenting first as a musician and (in 1968) as a painter. His paintings were made using recycled, low-cost materials, such as masonite squares, ceramic fragments, and bicycle paint. His style was na√Øve, bordering on surrealistic and humorous; most of his subjects were stereotypical African icons, such as wildlife or savannah landscapes. In 1970 he married Agatha Mataka, who was a Makonde from Mozambique. Eventually, Tingatinga's paintings became very popular among European residents and tourists, so that he was able to work full-time as an artist. He later gathered a group of apprentices and followers, that would later organize themselves into the Tingatinga Art Co- operative Society. Some of Tingatinga's followers in the Society (e.g., January Linda, Adeusi Mandu, Ajaba Adballah Mtalia, Casper Tedo, Simon Mptata and Omari Amonde) were Edward's or his wife's relatives, either Makua or Makonde. Of the first generation of Tingatinga students, only Edward's nephew Omari Amonde is still living. Death and heritage In 1972 Tingatinga was accidentally killed by a policeman who mistook him for a fugitive. The Tingatinga school survived, and grew in size and relevance. Through Tingatinga's followers and imitators, the Tingatinga style gradually became the prominent type of tourist-oriented paintings in both Tanzania, Kenya, and a large part of East Africa. Tingatinga is buried at the Msasani Cemetery in Dar es Salaam. Dispute about the origin Some sources claim that he was born in Mozambique rather than Tanzania. According to Daniel Augusta of the Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society, all these sources can be traced back to a mistake found in 1996 article by Swedish art critic Berit Sahlstr√∂m, Tingatinga and His Followers,Tingatinga and His followers that also reports Tingatinga's first name as \\"Eduardo\\" instead of \\"Edward\\".Tingatinga and the Mozambique Myth Sahlstr√∂m herself never met or interviewed the Tingatinga painters, but admittedly relied on a research paper by her student Mia Terent, who in turn reportedly got this information from the Swedish-Tanzanian missionary Barbro Johansson (also known as \\"Mama Barbro\\") in an interview on 12 May 1996.In a letter to the Tingatinga Society dated 7 October 2009, Sahlstr√∂m wrote: In turn, Mia Terent wrote The Tingatinga painters, the Tingatinga Arts Co-operative (TACS), and members of Edward's family (including his living son and daughter Daudi and Martina, his brother-in-law Gallusi and his half brother Omari Amonde), as well as scholars and art traders (among them, Jesper Kirknaes, Merete Teisen, Yves Goscinny, and Felix Lorenz, who long worked with the Tingatinga painters) reject the idea that Tingatinga was born in Mozambique. Despite being invited by the Tingatinga Society to publicly correct her mistake, Sahlstr√∂m refused to do so, but not on the basis that she was certain of her claim.

Career  De Vries achieved two university degrees; the first as a fencing master at the Academy of Fencing of Germany in Essen and Tauberbischofsheim, his second as a graduate sports teacher at the German Sport University Cologne. Finally, he was awarded an MBA degree after an international business degree course in Germany and the USA (Steinbeis University Berlin, DePaul University Chicago, Kelley School of Business, Indiana University) in 2005. After acting as the federal head coach for the German modern pentathlon association (1988‚Äì1993), sports director (1993‚Äì1996) and general secretary (1996‚Äì1998) of the German field hockey association, De Vries served as the head of the sponsoring & marketing department and, later, division manager of Bitburger Brewery Th. Simon GmbH (1998‚Äì2003). As an authorized signatory to the brewery, he focused on marketing, press and public relations, sponsoring and event management. In addition, he headed the technical company's service department and trade fair management. His activities at the company included developing a brand communications strategy centered on the Olympic National Committee, the German Football Association (DFB), and Formula 1, while acting as the official speaker of the German House at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The 2002 FIFA advertising campaign with the German national team received an award from the German POS Marketing Association in 2003. The year 2003 also saw De Vries appointed as the CEO of Leipzig 2012 GmbH by the National Olympic Committee of Germany, managing Germany's bid campaign for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The initiative was founded as an image campaign for Germany in the 2006 FIFA cup in Germany under the patronage of Germany's Federal President of the time, Horst K√∂hler. De Vries coordinated all of the companies and organizations involved, working with the German government and FIFA. Twenty-three German companies ‚Äì mostly listed on the DAX ‚Äì took part in the initiative. The first communications projects included support for the 31-country tour with Franz Beckenbauer, the \\"Welcome to Germany\\" initiative, the \\"Walk of Ideas\\" sculpture (which received the 2006 EVA Award, the Golden Flame Award and the German PR prize of 2007), as well as \\"365 places in the land of ideas\\" (a series of events that received the European Excellence Award). Most of the initiative's activities have moved outside Germany since the 2006 FIFA Cup; these include a three-year series of events, \\"Germany and China ‚Äì moving together\\" as well as the Shanghai EXPO in 2010. Germany increased its Nation Brands Index from 7 (2005) to 1 (2008), which was partly a result of these networked communications activities; the nation marketing initiative received the silver medal and politics award in 2006 at the AME Awards in New York.http://www.land-der- ideen.de/CDA/auszeichnungen,9800,0,,de.html Mike de Vries advised South African government institutions and the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) on knowledge transfer in using major sports events and communications platforms towards the 2010 FIFA since 2007, and is currently negotiating with Brazil on preparing for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In March 2010 he along with South African partners founded the \\"International Football Village\\" which received over 100000 visitors as a private fan park and hospitality platform of the FIFA World Cup. De Vries, member of the Association for Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, also lectures and works in consulting on nation branding, destination marketing, strategic communication and brand management.

The founding of the Norwegian Aviation Historical Society in 1967, gave the first boost to the idea of preserving aircraft in Norway. The Collection's Heinkel He 111 and Northrop N-3PB are among the aircraft traced, recovered and restored at the instigation of the NAHS. From the latter part of the 1970s onwards, a considerable number of historical aircraft were assembled in an old ex- Luftwaffe hangar at Gardermoen and from the mid-1980s the public were admitted to the hangar during summer. Most of the activities were - and still are - based on voluntary effort. The establishment of the Norwegian Aviation Museum in Bod√∏ in 1992 created in intense debate in the country, especially since it was the original intention to transfer all objects at Gardermoen to Bod√∏. After some years a compromise was found, and in 1997 funds were allocated for a new building at Gardermoen to house a military aviation museum. The new building was inaugurated in May 2000. From 1 January 2015 the collection is part of the Norwegian Air Force Museum/Armed Forces Museums.

An ecosystem is a biological community of interaction organisms and their actual physical environment. In Ecology, depauerate is an area that is so poor in species quantities and diversity. It lacks in numbers or a variety of species. Basically, a plant or animal is imperfectly developed. The reasons why there are depauperate areas are because the species do not have many competitors to fight with. Also, they have fewer resources causing the species not to survive without any protein or nutrients. Because these species lack the basic life necessities that they need, it‚Äôs hard for them to continue to carry on with life. ( The ecology of Adaptive Radiation). Therefore they aren‚Äôt reproducing the way that they are supposed to. In some cases, the species will actually start inbreeding. And because of that there are the same species everywhere. Therefore, competing with themselves, which can cause them to die. So, the area ends up falling short of the natural developmental size. ReferencesFurther reading *Schluter, Dolph.

Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others. The authors hypothesize there is an \\"incivility spiral\\" in the workplace made worse by \\"asymmetric global interaction\\". Incivility is distinct from aggression. The reduction of workplace incivility is an area for ongoing industrial and organizational psychology research.  Surveys on occurrence and effects  A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there. In research on more than 1000 U.S. civil service workers, Cortina, Magley, Williams, and Langhout (2001) found that more than 70% of the sample experienced workplace incivility in the past five years. Similarly, Laschinger, Leiter, Day, and Gilin found that among 612 staff nurses, 67.5% had experienced incivility from their supervisors and 77.6% had experienced incivility from their coworkers. In addition, they found that low levels of incivility along with low levels of burnout and an empowering work environment were significant predictors of nurses' experiences of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Incivility was associated with occupational stress and reduced job satisfaction. Other research shows that workplace incivility relates to job stress, depression, and life satisfaction as well. After conducting more than six hundred interviews with \\"employees, managers, and professionals in varying industries across the United States\\" and collecting \\"survey data from an additional sample of more than 1,200 employees, managers, and professionals representing all industrial categories in the United States and Canada\\", Pearson and Porath wrote in 2004 that \\"The grand conclusion: incivility does matter. Whether its costs are borne by targets, their colleagues, their organizations, their families, their friends outside work, their customers, witnesses to the interactions, or even the instigators themselves, there is a price to be paid for uncivil encounters among coworkers.\\" Citing previous research (2000) Pearson writes that \\"more than half the targets waste work time worrying about the incident or planning how to deal with or avert future interactions with the instigator. Nearly 40 percent reduced their commitment to the organization; 20 percent told us that they reduced their work effort intentionally as a result of the incivility, and 10 percent of targets said that they deliberately cut back the amount of time they spent at work.\\" Studies suggest that social support can buffer the negative effects of workplace incivility. Individuals who felt emotionally and organizationally socially supported reported fewer negative consequences (less depression and job stress, and higher in job and life satisfaction) of workplace incivility compared to those who felt less supported. Research also suggests that the negative effects of incivility can be offset by feelings of organizational trust and high regard for one's workgroup. Subtle/covert examples Examples at the more subtle end of the spectrum include: * asking for input and then ignoring it * \\"forgetting\\" to share credit for a collaborative work * giving someone a \\"dirty look\\" * interrupting others * not listening * side conversations during a formal business meeting/presentation * speaking with a condescending tone * waiting impatiently over someone's desk to gain their attention Overt examples Somewhere between the extremes are numerous everyday examples of workplace rudeness and impropriety including: * disrespecting workers by comments, gestures or proven behaviors (hostility) based on characteristics such as their race, religion, gender, etc. This is considered workplace discrimination. * disrupting meetings * emotional put- downs * giving dirty looks or other negative eye contact (i.e. \\"hawk eyes\\" considered to be threatening in the culture of the United States) * giving public reprimands * giving the silent treatment * insulting others * making accusations about professional competence * not giving credit where credit is due * overruling decisions without giving a reason * sending a nasty and demeaning note (hate mail) * talking about someone behind his or her back * undermining credibility in front of others Other overt forms of incivility might include emotional tirades and losing one's temper. Corporate symptoms of long term incivility #Higher than normal employee turnover. #A large number of employee grievances and complaints. #Lost work time by employees calling in sick. #Increased consumer complaints. #Diminished productivity in terms of quality and quantity of work. #Cultural and communications barriers. #Lack of confidence in leadership. #Inability to adapt effectively to change. #Lack of individual accountability. #Lack of respect.  Predicting = Gender  A number of studies have shown that women are more likely than men to experience workplace incivility and its associated negative outcomes. Research also shows that employees who witness incivility directed toward female coworkers have lower psychological wellbeing, physical health, and job satisfaction, which in turn relates lowered commitment toward the organization and higher job burnout and turnover intentions. Miner-Rubino and Cortina (2004) found that observing incivility toward women related to increased work withdrawal for both male and female employees, especially in work contexts where there were more men. Other research shows that incivility directed toward same-gender coworkers tends to lead to more negative emotionality for observers. While both men and women felt anger, fear, and anxiety arising from same-gender incivility, women additionally reported higher levels of demoralization after witnessing such mistreatment. Furthermore, the negative effects of same-gender incivility were more pronounced for men observing men mistreating other men than for women observing women mistreating other women. Miner and Eischeid (2012) suggest this disparity reflects men perceiving uncivil behavior as a ‚Äúclear affront to the power and status they have learned to expect for their group in interpersonal interactions.‚Äù Motherhood status has also been examined as a possible predictor of being targeted for incivility in the workplace.Miner-Rubino, K. \\"Does Being a Mom Help or Hurt? Workplace Incivility as a Function of Motherhood Status\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the AWP Annual Conference, Marriott Newport Hotel, Newport, Rhode Island. 2014-11-30 from http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p314713_index.html This research shows that mothers with three or more children report more incivility than women with two, one, or zero children. Fathers, on the other hand, report more incivility than men without children, but still less than mothers. While motherhood appears to predict increases in workplace incivility, results also showed that the negative outcomes associated with incivility were mitigated by motherhood status. Fatherhood status, on the other hand, did not mitigate the relationship between incivility and outcomes. Childless women reported more workplace incivility than childless men, and showed a stronger relationship between incivility and negative outcomes than childless men, mothers, and fathers.  Related notions = Workplace bullying  Workplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.  Petty authority  Another related notion is petty tyranny, which also involves a lack of consideration towards others, although petty tyranny is more narrowly defined as a profile of leaders and can also involve more severe forms of abuse of power and of authority.

Her epistolary novel Self-Deception explores the cultural and religious differences between the English and the French. Mrs Parker Works Emma Parker seems to have been an Anglican, and an impoverished member of the gentry class, who lived alone in Denbighshire, at Fairfield House. This was named after a family in her first novel, A Soldier's Offspring, or, The Sisters (1809), which she submitted to Minerva Press, specialists in sentimental and Gothic fiction, in the hope of earning some money. It was dedicated to her unnamed mother. It features a pair of sisters, one sensible, one flighty. Parker went on to write six more novels: Elfrida; or, the Heiress of Belgrove (1810), Fitz-Edward, or, The Cambrians (1811), Virginia; or the Peace of Amiens (1811), Aretas (1813), The Guerrilla Chief (1815), and the epistolary Self-Deception (1816).

Life Elizabeth Carey was the only child of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, and Elizabeth Spencer. Queen Elizabeth I was one of her godmothers.Beilin 2011. Her childhood was divided between the Hunsdon residence at Blackfriars, London, Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, and (from 1593) the manor of West Drayton, Middlesex.Duncan-Jones 1999, p. 307. She married Sir Thomas Berkeley on 19 February 1596, probably at Blackfriars, when she was nineteen years old: her wedding is one of the occasions that has been suggested that Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream was performed for the first time in public.Kathy Lynn Emerson, A Who's Who of Tudor Women, retrieved 12 October 2010 On 5 January 1606, at the wedding festivities of the Earl of Essex and Lady Frances Howard, Elizabeth was one of the female dancers representing the \\"Powers of Juno\\" in Ben Jonson's masque Hymenaei: there is an extant portrait of her dressed in her masque costume. She bore her husband a daughter and a son: * Theophila Berkeley (1596‚Äì1643), who married Sir Robert Coke. Theophila was educated \\"under the sole direction of her mother\\", and was later said to be fluent in French, Italian, Latin and Greek. * George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley (7 October 1601 ‚Äì 10 August 1658), who was tutored by Philemon Holland of Coventry. George married Elizabeth Stanhope, the daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope, by whom he had issue. Elizabeth and her husband circulated between Berkeley residences including New Park, Gloucestershire, Claverdon, Warwickshire, and Caludon Castle, near Coventry (the last being the principal home of her father-in-law, Henry, 7th Baron Berkeley, until his death in 1613). However, Sir Thomas was financially imprudent and ran up enormous debts. In a crisis of 1606‚Äì7, Elizabeth took over the management of his affairs (selling her own inheritance at Tonbridge and Hadlow, Kent, to minimise the burden); and in 1609 Sir Thomas signed a contract handing over all responsibility for household management to Elizabeth and the Berkeley family steward, John Smyth of Nibley. When Sir Thomas died (aged 37) in 1611, she paid off the many outstanding debts.Stone 1973, pp. 250‚Äì51, 255‚Äì59.Broadway 1999. In 1618 she bought the estate of Cranford, Middlesex for the sum of ¬£7,000 from the co-heirs of Sir Richard Aston. In February 1622, she remarried Sir Thomas Chamberlain (or Chamberland), a Justice of the King's Bench. When he died on 17 September 1625, her second husband bequeathed a generous ¬£10,000 to her son from her first marriage. Elizabeth died on 23 April 1635 and was buried on 25 April in Cranford parish church. Her white marble effigy, depicting her in her shroud, is by Nicholas Stone. Learning and patronage Carey's mother was educated and a noted patron of the arts, and passed these traits on to her daughter. Carey was tutored by Henry Stanford. In 1594, aged 18, she is known to have translated two of Petrarch's sonnets from Italian into English.Duncan-Jones 1999. In the same year, Thomas Nashe dedicated The Terrors of the Night to her, praising her \\"sharpe Wit\\" and \\"religious piety\\".Duncan-Jones 1999, pp. 307‚Äì9. (The previous year, Nashe had dedicated Christ's Teares Over Jerusalem to her mother.) Peter Erondelle's French primer and book of manners, The French Garden (1605), was also dedicated to her, and it has been suggested that she served as the model for the character of \\"Lady Rimellaine\\" in the book. In 1610, she was patron of Philemon Holland's translation from the Latin of William Camden's Britannia. She appears to have considered contributing ¬£20, and perhaps ¬£40, towards the volume; and in a commendatory poem Thomas Muriell praised her as the \\"rare Phoenix cause of this translation\\". However, shortly before publication, she seems to have become dissatisfied with the quality of Holland's work and withdrew her support: the published book does not mention her patronage, although she is mentioned in the next edition of 1637.Harris 2015, pp. 285‚Äì7. She is also listed among the many dedicatees of Camden's Annales (1625). She donated volumes in Latin, Greek, French, Italian and English to Coventry school and city library.

It educates visually impaired children aged between two and nineteen, including those who are multi-disabled visually impaired. The school was one of two residential schools for blind children opened by the London School Board in 1902. Initially for boys only, the original location of the school was at Wandsworth Common. The present main school building was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1934.  History  The school's original building at 26 Bolingbroke Grove (known as Linden Lodge) on the east side of Wandsworth Common had been designed in 1876 by the architect E R Robson as a private residence for a retired headmistress, Marjory Peddie. On Peddie's death in 1879, the building was purchased by the School for the Indigent Blind, then located at St George's Fields, Southwark, which opened a school for junior pupils. In 1902, the entire school (including the elementary department) moved to Leatherhead, Surrey and the house was put up for sale again. The building was subsequently taken over by the London School Board and Linden Lodge School (as it is still known today) opened on 10 December 1902. The school educated around fifty blind boys aged between 13 and 16, of whom around forty were boarders. A similar school for visually impaired girls was opened at Elm Court in West Norwood in June of the same year. During the Second World War the children of both schools were evacuated away from London. The boys returned to Bolingbroke Grove in 1945, however Elm Court School had suffered considerable bomb damage during the Blitz and it was not practical for the girls to resume their education there. After several years at temporary locations in both Brighton and Sunningdale, the girls were moved to North House in Wimbledon (now the main school site) and from 1949 onwards Linden Lodge operated as a single coeducational school split between two locations, under the control of one headmaster: The junior boys and girls (up to the age of ten) were both housed and taught at the North House site, whilst the senior girls were transported by bus each morning to join the older boys for lessons on the Bolingbroke Grove site. The Bolingbroke Grove site was closed in 1964, when the senior boys moved to a purpose built school in the grounds of North House. Today, 26 Bolingbroke Grove forms part of Northcote Lodge School. Linden Lodge was the first school in the UK to use the Perkins Upward Brailler to enable their students to type using the Braille alphabet. North House North House was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1934 for Robert Wilson Black, a partner of the Estate Agents firm Knight & Co. and a local hotelier. In 2006 Sprunt Architects extensively refurbished the original Lutyens house, designed a new residential building for the students and restored the original Gertrude Jekyll garden.  Wandsworth Sensory Support Services  Historically in Wandsworth, having two well-established schools for children with visual impairment (Linden Lodge School) and hearing impairment (Oak Lodge School) and two Sensory Support Services (Hearing Support & Vision Support) meant that there was likely to be a larger than average group of children with combined losses. Following the Linden Lodge School governing body taking oversight for the hearing support service, Wandsworth Sensory Support Service was created to improve joint working between the two Sensory Support Services. On the 18 May 2018 The Isobel Centre a new purpose-built facility opened to house the core office for both Services and specialist assessment rooms on the Linden Lodge School campus.  Wandsworth Vision Support Service  Wandsworth Vision Support Service is based in the Lodge Family Centre, within the grounds of Linden Lodge School. The Service works in close collaboration with the school, it also provides an outreach service to support all children and young people from birth to 19 years with visual impairment with and without additional needs in the boroughs of Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea. The school's governing body oversees the service (Sensory Support Service Committee).  Wandsworth Hearing Support Service  Wandsworth Hearing Support Service provides outreach support to deaf children and young people in Wandsworth from birth to 19 years of age in both mainstream and special schools. The school's governing body oversees the service (Sensory Support Service Committee).  ClearVision Project  ClearVision is a national postal lending library for visually impaired children and their families based at Linden Lodge School. The library began as a modest collection of braille and print books created in the mid-1980s for students at the school, before becoming an independent charity in 1992. ClearVision books are commercially published children's books with text added in either Braille or Moon and are designed for children with little or no sight to share with sighted children or adults. The project lends to approximately 100 public libraries in the UK and also lends directly to around 130 families with visually impaired children.

Oneida Indian Nation of New York State, 470 U.S. 226 (1985), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning aboriginal title in the United States. The case, sometimes referred to as Oneida II, was \\"the first Indian land claim case won on the basis of the Nonintercourse Act.\\", 1988, at 145. The Supreme Court held that Indian tribes have a common law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon aboriginal title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action, and that the cause of action was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches, a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about. Furthermore, the Court held that, due to the Eleventh Amendment, federal courts could not exercise ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities. The case is often referred to as Oneida II because it is the second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction, and was followed by City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to re-assert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land re-acquired by the tribe in fee simple. Background This was the second time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by unanimously holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claim.Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I), 414 U.S. 661 (1974). Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor. On remand, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York had found the counties liable to the Oneida for wrongful possession of their lands, awarded damages of $16,694, plus interest, representing the fair rental value of the land in question for the 2-year period specified in the complaint. Finally, the District Court required New York state to indemnify the counties. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.719 F.2d 525 (2d Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court granted certiorari \\"to determine whether an Indian tribe may have a live cause of action for a violation of its possessory rights that occurred 175 years ago,\\" ultimately agreeing with the District Court and Second Circuit that the tribe may.470 U.S. at 230. On appeal, the counties did not dispute the District Court's findings that the Oneida held aboriginal title to the lands in question, and that the 1795 conveyances of the lands to the state violated the Nonintercourse Act.470 U.S. at 232-33. The counties instead argued that the Nonintercourse Act preempted the Oneida's cause of action, that any cause of action was time barred, nonjusticable, and abated, and that any conveyance was ratified by the federal government.470 U.S. at 233. Change of counsel The case was initiated by George Shattuck of Bond, Schoeneck & King(BS&K;), on a contingency fee basis rather than as a pro bono matter., 1991, at 6. The retainer agreement between the firm and the tribe, approved (as required) by the Department of the Interior, provided that the firm would litigate the tribe's Nonintercourse Act claim only against the government and would not sue private land owners; another firm was handling the tribe's claim before the Indian Claims Commission., 1991, at 9-11, 26, 39, 41, 73, 94, 202. Shattuck argued Oneida I alone before the Supreme Court., 1991, at 34. The Native American Rights Fund (NARF), which had assisted initially assisted the firm,, 1991, at ix, 29-31, 33, 37, 59, 61, 64. served as co-counsel in the trial after the Oneida I decision, 1991, at 43, 48. and took over completely on the second appeal., 1991, at xii, xix. The NARF also filed another suit behalf of the Oneidas, pressing the Oneida's possessory claims against landowners over additional lands., 1991, at 75-79. As of March 2011, BS&K; had yet to receive any attorney's fees from the tribe.Glen Coin, Syracuse law firm wants more money for work it did early on in the Oneida land claim case , March 11, 2011. On July 11, 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York ruled that BS&K; was entitled to $5,174.54 in fees; the district court reduced the fees to that number after finding that BS&K; had breached its duty of loyalty to the Oneida's by also representing the Canadian claimants.Oneida Indian Nation v. Cnty. of Oneida, Nos. 5:70‚ÄìCV‚Äì0035(LEK), 5:74‚ÄìCV‚Äì187 (LEK/DRH)., 2011 WL 2728388 (N.D.N.Y. July 12, 2011).  Opinion of the Court  The majority opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. recognized the Oneida's federal common law cause of action, and rejected all the counties' affirmative defenses. ;Cause of action The Second Circuit held that the Oneida's had both a federal common law cause of action and an implied cause of action under the Nonintercourse Act of 1793 (the version that governed the 1795 transaction). The Supreme Court did not reach the statutory question because it held that \\"the Indians' common-law right to sue is firmly established.\\" The court recognized that \\"[n]umerous decisions of this Court prior to Oneida I recognized at least implicitly that Indians have a federal common-law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights,\\" citing a string of examples back to Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823).470 U.S. at 235. The court concluded: > [W]e hold that the Oneidas can maintain this action for violation of their > possessory rights based on federal common law.470 U.S. at 236. As to the Nonintercourse Act, the Court held that it did not preempt the cause of action because \\"[t]he Nonintercourse Act of 1793 does not speak directly to the question of remedies for unlawful conveyances of Indian land.\\"470 U.S. at 237. The court noted that the Act \\"did not establish a comprehensive remedial plan for dealing with violations of Indian property rights\\" and that there was \\"no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to pre-empt common-law remedies.\\" Because the Act contained no remedial provisions, and because subsequent Congressional enactments contemplated possessory land suits by Indians, the Court found that preemption was not indicated.470 U.S. at 237-39. The court reviewed its recent aboriginal title decisions, and reiterated its statement in Oneida I that the Act merely \\"put in statutory form what was or came to be the accepted rule.\\"470 U.S. at 240 (quoting Oneida I, 414 U.S. at 678). ;Statute of limitations Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. sustained the Oneida's federal common law cause of action and rejected all of the counties' affirmative defenses. Where there is no statute of limitations for a federal cause of action, the general rule is to borrow the analogous state statute of limitations unless such would be inconsistent with the underlying federal policies.470 U.S. at 240. However, here, the Court held that \\"borrowing of a state limitations period in these cases would be inconsistent with federal policy.\\"470 U.S. at 241. Reviewing Congressional actions in the context of the Indian Claims Commission, the Court concluded that \\"It would be a violation of Congress' will were we to hold that a state statute of limitations period should be borrowed in these circumstances.\\"470 U.S. at 244. ;Laches The majority noted that the four dissenting justices would have barred the Oneida's claim under laches. However, the majority noted that \\"we do not reach this issue today\\" because the District Court had ruled against the counties laches defense, and the counties had not raised the issue in the Second Circuit. In a footnote, the majority opined that \\"application of the equitable defense of laches in an action at law would be novel indeed.\\"470 U.S. at 245 n.16. The same footnote cited Ewert v. Bluejacket, 259 U.S. 129 (1922) for the proposition that laches \\"cannot properly have application to give vitality to a void deed and to bar the rights of Indian wards in lands subject to statutory restrictions.\\" The majority called the application of laches \\"questionable\\" and noted that such \\"would appear to be inconsistent with established federal policy.\\" In its final footnote, the majority noted that, on \\"[t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day Oneida Indians . . ., we express no opinion as to . . . the final disposition of this case should Congress not exercise its authority to resolve these far-reaching Indian claims.\\"470 U.S. at 254 n.27. ;Abatement The counties advanced the theory that the causes of action under Nonintercourse Acts of 1790, 1793, 1796, 1799, and 1802 (unlike the final 1833 version) abated upon the expiration of the statutes. However, the Court held that because the different versions of the Act contained \\"substantially the same restraint on the alienation of Indian lands . . . , the precedents of this Court compel the conclusion that the Oneidas' cause of action has not abated.\\"470 U.S. at 246. ;Ratification The counties advanced the theory that later treaties between the Oneidas and the United States, which ceded different lands to New York, constituted a ratification of the earlier conveyances (and thus those conveyances were in compliance with the Nonintercourse Act). The Court found this interpretation untenable under the canons of construction of federal Indian law, which provide that, inter alia, \\"treaties should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians.\\"470 U.S. at 247. ;Nonjusticiability The counties final argument was that the Oneida's land claim was a nonjusticiable political question. The Court found this argument to be non-meritorious in light of similar Indian law precedents.470 U.S. at 248-50. ;Ancillary jurisdiction The final question before the Court was whether the District Court rightly exercised ancillary jurisdiction over the counties' cross-claim against the state for indemnification. The Court rejected, as having \\"no basis in law,\\" the Second Circuit's theory that \\"by violating a federal statute, the State consented to suit in federal court by any party on any claim, state or federal, growing out of the same nucleus of operative facts as the statutory violation.\\"470 U.S. at 251. Although the counties' cross-claim would meet the traditional criteria for ancillary jurisdiction, the Court found those criteria foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment. ;Conclusion The Court concluded by remarking upon the \\"potential consequences of affirmance,\\" arguing that \\"this litigation makes abundantly clear the necessity for congressional action\\" to extinguish Indian title by statute.470 U.S. at 253. In the words of the Court: > One would have thought that claims dating back for more than a century and a > half would have been barred long ago. As our opinion indicates, however, > neither petitioners nor we have found any applicable statute of limitations > or other relevant legal basis for holding that the Oneidas' claims are > barred or otherwise have been satisfied. Brennan and Marshall Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Thurgood Marshall joined the entirety of the majority's opinion, except the ancillary jurisdiction portion. In a brief opinion, Brennan reiterated his view from Yeomans v. Kentucky (1975) that the Eleventh Amendment \\"bars federal court suits against States only by citizens of other States.\\"470 U.S. at 254 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., concurring). Stevens, Burger, White, and Rehnquist Justice John Paul Stevens would have barred the Oneida's claim under the equitable doctrine of laches. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Byron White and William Rehnquist joined the majority's opinion as to No. 83-1240 (the cross-claims against the state) but dissented as to No. 83-1065 (the Oneida's claims against the counties).470 U.S. at 255 (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C.J., White, J., and Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The dissenters would have barred the Oneida's claim under the equitable doctrine of laches, noting: > [In 1795, the Oneidas] made no attempt to assert the claim, and their > successors in interest waited 175 years before bringing suit to avoid a 1795 > conveyance that the Tribe freely made, for a valuable consideration. The > absence of any evidence of deception, concealment, or interference with the > Tribe's right to assert a claim, together with the societal interests that > always underlie statutes of repose-particularly when title to real property > is at stake-convince me that this claim is barred by the extraordinary > passage of time. It is worthy of emphasis that this claim arose when George > Washington was the President of the United States.470 U.S. at 255-56. The dissenters noted various historical examples of the Court applying laches to Indian equitable claims, and argued that the doctrine should also be applied to the action of ejectment (which they admitted was an action at law, not equity).470 U.S. at 256. Specifically, they cited \\"[t]hree decisions of this Court illustrate the application of the doctrine of laches to actions seeking to set aside conveyances made in violation of federal law.\\"470 U.S. at 263. Moreover, the dissenters quoted Lewis v. Marshall, 30 U.S. 470 (1831), for the proposition that: > The best interests of society require that causes of action should not be > deferred an unreasonable time. This remark is peculiarly applicable to land > titles. Nothing so much retards the growth and prosperity of a country as > insecurity of titles to real estate. Labor is paralysed where the enjoyment > of its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous > consequences to individuals. The dissent concluded: > The Court, no doubt, believes that it is undoing a grave historical > injustice, but in doing so it has caused another, which only Congress may > now rectify.470 U.S. at 273. The dissent did not address the other defenses raised by the counties.  Subsequent developments =Remand On remand, after decades of settlement efforts, Judge McCurn entered judgments of $15,994 against Oneida County and $18,970 against Madison County, representing the full fair market rental value, minus set-offs for improvements, plus pre-judgment interest.Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Cnty. of Oneida, 217 F. Supp. 2d 292 (N.D.N.Y. 2002). The following year, McCurn denied cross-motions for relief from the judgment- seeking to correct various mathematical errors previously made by Judge Port-- due to a pending appeal before the Second Circuit.Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Cnty. of Oneida, 214 F.R.D. 83 (N.D.N.Y. 2003). After a stipulated remand, McCurn granted both motions.Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Cnty. of Oneida, No. 70-cv-35, 2003 WL 21026573 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2003). Companion cases ;Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York (2d Cir. 1988) Another Oneida claim, challenging the pre-constitutional conveyance of another tract, was rejected by the Second Circuit in 1988, on the grounds that the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 had neither the authority nor the intent to limit the acquisition of Indian lands within the borders of the states.Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. New York, 860 F.2d 1145 (2d Cir. 1988). ;City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (U.S. 2005) After decades, the Oneida became frustrated by the failure of the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y., 544 U.S. 197 (2005). On remand, the district court held that, although the counties could tax the Oneida, due to tribal sovereign immunity, they could not foreclose on land held by the tribe in satisfaction of these unpaid taxes. The Second Circuit affirmed, but two of the judges urged the Supreme Court to overrule some of its tribal sovereign immunity precedents. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari, the tribe passed an ordinance consenting to taxation, and the Court vacated and remanded.Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Madison Cnty., 401 F. Supp. 2d 219 (N.D.N.Y. 2005), motion to amend denied, 235 F.R.D. 559 (N.D.N.Y. 2006), aff'd, 605 F.3d 149 (2nd Cir. 2010), cert. granted, 131 S. Ct. 459 (2010), vacated and remanded sub nom. Madison Cnty. v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y., 131 S. Ct. 704 (2011) (per curiam). ;Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (2d Cir. 2010) Oneida I and Oneida II were litigated as test cases by both sides; the Oneidas suit against the counties for 200 years of damages was stayed pending its resolution. After settlement efforts, that suit resumed in 2000.Marble Hill Oneida Indians v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State, 62 F. App'x 389 (2d Cir. 2003) (affirming denial of Marble Hill Oneida Indian's motion to intervene); Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. New York, 194 F.

Dec. 23 1999) (deeming as withdrawn the portions of the litigation related to Upstate Citizens for Equality's challenge to the Oneida's casino). In a similar suit by a different tribe, the Second Circuit adopted the view of the four dissenting Oneida II justices in Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki (2005).Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Pataki, 413 F.3d 266 (2d Cir. 2005). The same laches defense defeated the larger Oneida claim.Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. New York, 500 F. Supp. 2d 128 (N.D.N.Y. 2007) (holding that laches bars possessory, but not non-possessory, claims), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, and remanded sub nom. Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida, 617 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that laches bars both possessory and non-possessory claims).

Plot summary  On a tennis holiday in Antigua, British university lecturer Peregrine \\"Perry\\" Makepiece and his lawyer girlfriend Gail Perkins meet mysterious Russian business oligarch Dmitri \\"Dima\\" Vladimirovich Krasnov and his family. Dima, who describes himself as \\"the world's number one money launderer,\\" deliberately sought contact with Perry hoping that he is a British spy or knows one. This is because Dima wants Perry to pass on information about his criminal activities to British intelligence, in exchange for protection for himself and his family. Dima fears for his life because \\"The Prince\\", the new leader of his criminal brotherhood, had a good friend of Dima and his wife murdered. The Prince now wants Dima to come to Bern to sign over control of the money- laundering operations to him. Back in the UK, Perry reaches out to a colleague with contacts in the British intelligence community and hands over Dima's notes. Since these implicate a high-ranking decision maker in the UK, British intelligence decides to put government fixer Hector Meredith in charge of a secret semi-official investigation. Hector recruits disgraced intelligence officer Luke Weaver to handle the investigation. Luke, eager to redeem himself, makes all the necessary arrangements. Dima insists that Perry and Gail be present during his first contact with British intelligence in Paris during the 2009 Roland Garros final, so the couple travel to Paris where they again meet with Dima and his family. After Dima signs the papers handing over his assets to a representative of \\"The Prince\\", he meets with Luke and is extracted, along with his family, to a safe house in the Swiss Alps. They wait there until British intelligence insists that only Dima travel to the UK; his family will be allowed to join him later if his information proves correct. Dima reluctantly agrees and travels with Luke to catch the charter plane that is supposed to bring them to the UK, only to be killed as the plane explodes shortly after take-off. Reception The New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani described it as \\"part vintage John le Carr√© and part Alfred Hitchcock\\", calling it the author's most thrilling thriller in years. James Naughtie, writing for The Telegraph, praised le Carre's dialogue, saying his \\"greatest gift may be his ear, which allows him to pick up a tremor of fear in the softest voice or a false note in any exchange of words and play with them to his heart‚Äôs content. He can therefore create, in dialogue, a trembling soundscape that has a pitch-perfect quality.\\" While praising the book, The Guardians Christopher Tayler wrote: \\"By this stage of his career, Le Carr√© seems more interested in the telling than the tale, and in the actors more than in their actions. But his deft setting up of colourful characters, and slightly less deft meshing of psychology and plot requirements, doesn't always make for narrative tension. The long, fussily narrated opening, in particular, takes nearly 100 pages to get the reader hooked.\\" ReferencesExternal links *John le Carr√© on His New Novel, Our Kind of Traitor - video interview by Democracy Now! *Book review by The Independents literary editor, Boyd Tonkin *Book review by The Scotsmans literary editor, Ian Campbell Category:2010 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Novels by John le Carr√© Category:Thriller novels Category:Novels about the Russian Mafia ","title":"Our Kind of Traitor"},{"id":"29162822","text":"Ptilophora is a genus of moths of the family Notodontidae The genus was described by Stephens in 1828.

Carr,\\" was a Democratic Party politician in the state of Tennessee who served almost 27 years as Tennessee Secretary of State.David R. Sowell, Joseph Cordell Carr, Sr. Papers, Tennessee Historical Society Biography=Early life Joseph Carr was born June 20, 1907, in Cookeville, Tennessee. His father, Sidney Forrest Carr, worked for nine years as a clerk in the Tennessee Secretary of State's office and was a one-term member of the Tennessee General Assembly, representing Putnam County from 1919 to 1921. He also was a campaign manager for U.S. Congressman Cordell Hull. The Carr family moved to Nashville in 1918, and Joe Carr was educated at Montgomery Bell Academy and the Peabody Demonstration School in Nashville. His first experience in state government was serving as a page in the Tennessee State Senate in 1923, when he was 16. His first experience in a political campaign came in 1924, when he was an office boy in the campaign headquarters for U.S. Senate candidate Nathan Bachman. In 1925 he served as a page in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He continued to work on the staff of the state legislature in subsequent years, holding positions as assistant bill clerk, assistant chief clerk, and chief clerk of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Political career In 1932, Joe Carr was one of the founding members of the Young Democratic Clubs of Tennessee, serving as the organization's first secretary. In 1934 he was elected state president of the Young Democrats. In 1940, he was manager for the re-election campaigns of the \\"Coalition Ticket,\\" three Democratic candidates backed by Memphis political boss Edward Crump: Governor Prentice Cooper, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, and Commissioner of Railroads and Public Utilities Porter Dunlap. His service to the party having earned him Crump's support, on January 8, 1941, the Tennessee General Assembly elected Carr to the position of Secretary of State by a unanimous vote. He was to serve in that office longer than any other Tennessee Secretary of State,Past Constitutional Officers, Tennessee Blue Book 2009-2010 serving on three occasions for a total of almost 27 years. His first term in the position ended in May 1944, when he voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II. Governor Cooper appointed Carr's wife, Mary Hart Carr, to fill her husband's unexpired term, making her the first woman to serve as a state constitutional officer in Tennessee. After Carr's four-year term ended in January 1945, Mrs. Carr was elected to a new four-year term by the General Assembly. When Joe Carr returned home in the summer of 1945, Mrs. Carr resigned the seat, and Governor Jim Nance McCord appointed him to take up the job again beginning August 1.Joe C. Carr, Secretary of State, Tennessee Blue Book 1975-1978, page 33 In 1948, incumbent governor Jim Nance McCord lost his bid for renomination to Gordon Browning, a former governor who campaigned for the Democratic nomination as an opponent of Crump. After Browning and his allies gained control of the Tennessee state government, Carr, who was allied with Crump, was replaced as Secretary of State in January 1949, when the General Assembly elected James Cummings to the office. After losing his position in state government, Carr embarked on a short career in the private sector, establishing an insurance business in Nashville. In 1952 he joined Frank G. Clement's gubernatorial campaign as an advisor and staff member. In January 1953, following Clement's election as governor, Carr became chief clerk of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Four years later, in January 1957, the General Assembly returned him to the position of Secretary of State. He held the office for the next 20 years, retiring in January 1977. U.S. Supreme Court case As secretary of state, and thus the official responsible for conducting elections in the state, Joe Carr was the nominal defendant in the famous 1962 U.S. Supreme Court case Baker v. Carr, in which the Supreme Court held that Congressional and legislative districts had to be of substantially equal populations in order to comply with the \\"equal protection\\" provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (the so-called \\"one man one vote\\" decision). Carr's name on the case as defendant was merely ex officio; the General Assembly, not the secretary of state, was responsible for setting the district boundaries. His responsibility was to publish the resulting map and conduct elections accordingly. Final years After Carr's retirement, a bronze bust of him was placed in the Tennessee State Capitol at the direction of the General Assembly and Governor Ray Blanton. He was the first person to be honored in that way during his lifetime.

Description The cluster was formed by four separate galaxy clusters that have been involved in a collision. This is the first time that this phenomenon has been observed. The repeated collisions in MACSJ0717 are caused by a 13-million-light-year-long stream of galaxies, gas, and dark matter, known as a filament, pouring into a region already full of matter. When two or more of the galaxy clusters collide, the hot gas in the interstellar medium slows down, but the galaxies, composed mostly of empty space, do not slow as fast. The speed and direction of each of the clusters involved in the collision can thus be approximated through examining the offset between the galaxies and the gas. Of the four subclusters, A, B, C, D, subcluster B is moving quickly relative to the other three subclusters, which are relatively at rest in relation to each other. The quick moving B exhibits kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ effect for short), the first time this has been observed in an object, instead of statistically. The B subcluster's kinetic SZ effect was discovered due to its lack of a thermal SZ effect, unlike the other three subclusters. MACS J0717 forms one of the largest known Einstein rings, with gravitational lensing distorting the light that reaches us from several adjacent phenomena.Adi Zitrin, Tom Broadhurst, Yoel Rephaeli, Sharon Sadeh: \\"The Largest Gravitational Lens: MACS J0717.5+3745 (z = 0.546)\\", The Astrophysical Journal, 707:L102-L106, 2009 December 10.

According to the Department of Justice, Hong Kong has a large volume of subsidiary legislation. The making of subsidiary legislation is subject to the ambit of administrative law. Definition Subsidiary legislation refers to legislation made under delegated powers granted by other legislation made by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Very often the powers are given to the executive branch, such as a particular government organ. However, not all rules made by the executive are subsidiary legislation. The government may make policy documents in the absence of statutory delegation, although sometimes such documents are authorized by statute. Such documents are not binding in nature and has no strict legal status. On the other hand, subsidiary legislation creates binding rights and obligations. Constitutional basis Subsidiary legislation is authorized by the Basic Law under Article 56 and 62. Control of subsidiary legislation There are concerns that subsidiary legislation may be abused and threaten the powers of the legislature. Therefore, there are methods for controlling subsidiary legislation, the main ones being legislative control and judicial review. Legislative control Legislative control of subsidiary legislation is mainly contained in the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1). Section 28(1)(b) stipulates that no subsidiary legislation shall be inconsistent with the provisions of any Ordinance. Section 28(1)(c) states that subsidiary legislation may at any time be amended by the person making it and in the same manner by and in which it was made. Section 28(1)(e) sets an upper limit on the maximum punishment that can be laid down in subsidiary legislative provisions that create criminal offences. Section 34 of the same Ordinance requires that all subsidiary legislation shall be laid on the table of the Legislative Council at the next sitting after the publication in the Gazette of that subsidiary legislation. In such circumstances, the Legislative Council may, by resolution amend the subsidiary legislation in any manner consistent with the power to make such subsidiary legislation. Section 35 further provides that where any Ordinance provides that its subsidiary legislation shall be subject to the approval of the Legislative Council or other authority, then the subsidiary legislation shall be submitted for approval by the Legislative Council or other authority, and the Legislative Council may by resolution or the other authority may by order amend the whole or any part of the subsidiary legislation. However, it has been held that failure to table does not affect validity of the subsidiary legislation.Auburntown [1994] 2 HKLR 272, 289 It is also possible for the enabling legislation to exempt the requirement of tabling.ESF v Bird [1997] 3 HKC 434, 439 Judicial review Subsidiary legislation is subject to judicial review. One of the main grounds of invalidity of subsidiary legislation is excess of enabling power, which questions whether the subsidiary legislation has gone further than the scope permitted by the enabling legislation. In Water Network Ltd v The Urban Council,[1997] AC 168 the Urban Council had power to issue subsidiary legislation for operation of hawking. Traditionally, there has been two categories of hawking: fixed place hawking and itinerant hawking. Subsidiary legislation was amended so that licenses for itinerant hawkers would no longer be issued, thereby prohibiting such hawking. The Privy Council held, on appeal from Hong Kong, that the word regulate means that while it would be impossible to wholly prohibit hawking of all types, it is permissible to partially prohibit hawking of certain types under parliamentary sovereignty. Therefore, the subsidiary legislation in question was invalid. In Kambo Mercedes & Another v Jenny McElney and Others,[1983] HKLR 308 the courts have power under the Supreme Court Ordinance to make rules governing \\"practice and procedure\\". However, the Rules of High Court, which was a subsidiary legislation made under the Supreme Court Ordinance, conferred power on judges to grant monetary award and holiday pay to amend pleadings so as to add new causes of action, even if the legislation period has expired. It was held the provision concerned was not strong since practice and procedure does not entail that new rights can be created. Nor does the phrase allow interference with existing rights. If a subsidiary legislation is indeed found to be in excess of enabling power, the court must strike it down 2010 constitutional row The Hong Kong government claimed that the Tseung Kwan O landfill would be full by 2013.Country Parks (Designation)(Consolidation)(Amendment) Order 2010 to be gazetted tomorrow.

The Standard. Retrieved on 2010-11-26. On 6 October 2010, Environment Secretary Edward Yau Tang-wah said the government decided to postpone the plan from November 1 to January 1, 2012, to give lawmakers more time to study its implications. On 12 October, Legislative Council President Tsang Yok-sing granted a motion seeking to repeal the order, to be tabled on 13 October. It was agreed by the government and the Legislative Council that the order concerned is a piece of subsidiary legislation. However, the two parties disagreed as to what the legislature can do on a chief executive's order that has been approved by the Chief Executive-in- Council. While the Department of Justice said the repeal would have no legal effect in law, and the designation order would remain in force even if Legco passed the motion to repeal, the Legislative Council legal adviser Jimmy Ma insisted that the legislature has the power to repeal the order to change the park boundary to expand the landfill. The matter centres on the proper interpretation to be given to the word \\"amend\\" and may have to be settled by judicial review if the motion is passed.

The Farm In the farm lives an old widow, Dona Benta (\\"Mrs. Benta\\"), and her two grandchildren, a girl, L√∫cia, referred to only by her nickname \\"Narizinho\\" (roughly \\"Little Nose\\", because of her turned-up nose), and her boy cousin, Pedrinho (\\"Pete\\"); the servant and cook, a black woman named Nast√°cia (\\"Anastacia\\"), and two talking puppets, the rag doll Em√≠lia (animated by some of Doctor Snail's \\"talking pills\\" she somehow \\"ingested\\") and an aristocratic and learned puppet made of corncob, the Viscount of Sabugosa (\\"sabugo\\" means corncob in Portuguese, \\"Sabugosa\\" is a parody of the real Count de Sabugosa). The Viscount always wears a top hat. The farm is home to various talking animals, including the fat pig Rabic√≥ (\\"Short-Tail\\"), the cow Mocha (pronounced \\"Maw-sha\\"), the intelligent donkey Conselheiro (\\"Advisor\\"), and a tender rhinoceros called Quindim (named after quindim, a Brazilian dessert), who fled from a circus and was kept hidden by the children. While in the farm, the children live several adventures in fantasy, with or without the participation of the older ones. The farm was devised as an attempt to sum up widespread characteristics of the Brazilian rural living of its time for educational purposes: Lobato intended to teach children to understand, to enjoy and to be proud of their cultural heritage and tried to do so by creating an entire milieu in which to set his children's stories so that they could all have a common Brazilian feel and background. The major features of the farm were established by the novel A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado (The Girl With the Turned Up Nose), published in December 1920. The stream The nearby stream is usually visited by L√∫cia, where she feeds its fishes with breadcrumbs. After Em√≠lia comes to life, it becomes difficult since the doll constantly astounds the trout with her constant gabble. The stream later reveals itself to be a portal for a wondrous underwater world, the Reino das √Åguas Claras (\\"Clear Waters Kingdom\\"), where L√∫cia creates a bond, particularly to its king, the fish Pr√≠ncipe Escamado (\\"Scaly Prince\\"). The Tucanos A virgin forest that surrounds the farm, the Tucanos are inhabited by several supernatural beings from the Brazilian folklore. It is populated by a family of Sacis, tiny, black and one-legged gnomes who enjoy their time playing pranks on the farmers. They are able to manipulate wind, traveling inside swirls. The ophidian Boitat√° usually leaves the forest to feed itself with cows or oxen. The evil, reptilian witch Cuca lives in a cave inside the Tucanos. At the river, Pedrinho is seduced and almost killed by Iara, before the Saci saves him. At night, the Tucanos are a refuge for the Werewolf (or Lobishomen) and the Headless Mule, both originally ordinary people who suffered from an eternal and grisly curse. The Tucanos village The \\"Arraial dos Tucanos\\" is a nearby village occasionally visited by the farm dwellers. Colonel Teodorico and Elias the Merchant, good friends of Mr. Benta, live there. This setting and its characters have minor participation in the novels, but received later prominence in Rede Globo's television series. Other worlds Using a powerful magic powder, the \\"Pirlimpimpim\\", the children and their living toys manage to actually visit fictitious, non-existent or lost worlds, such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece (where the group intervene in Hercules' twelve labours, befriending him), the Fable and the Grammar worlds. Through the powder, Em√≠lia lands in the End of the World itself, searching for the House of Keys in order to switch down the War key (and consequently World War II). In O Picapau Amarelo, the farm is visited by several fairy tale characters, including Cinderella, Snow White, Red Riding Hood, all of them led by Tom Thumb (a good friend of Em√≠lia's).

Biography  Nephew of the poet Salvatore Di Giacomo, he began to play the drums and cymbals in a band with his brother Pino ‚Äì who played the snare drum (before such band managed to acquire a whole set) throughout the ten years of engagement at the Cinema Sansone, where ‚Äì it being the silent era ‚Äì it provided the soundtrack of films being shown; thus learning the art ‚Äì soon to come in handy ‚Äì to improvise and invent sounds and noises, with the imaginative use of anything he could find that he could strike. After working in the orchestras of Gino Campese, Nello Segurini, Armando Del Conte and Gino Dome, during the Second World War, Gege' di Giacomo was hired by Renato Carosone, on 28 October 1949, together with the Dutch guitarist Peter Van Wood, to become part of the trio that would mark a turning point in the history of Neapolitan song. The first hit record of the trio ‚Äì recorded for Path√© ‚Äì contains \\"Music, music, music\\" played by Renato Carosone and Gege' Di Giacomo and sung by Peter Van Wood (who left in 1952 to pursue a solo career). Gege' Di Giacomo however remained, alongside Carosone who in the meantime had hired other musicians to form his own band, which defined itself completely in the second half of the fifties as the \\"Complesso Carosone\\" (i.e. the \\"Carosone ensemble\\"). Many of the songs were born from Carosone's long collaboration with lyricist Nisa, and the merit of the extraordinary international success of these was also Gege's. On the evening of 13 May 1954 at the Caprice nightclub in Milan during their song \\"La Panse\\", Gege suddenly shouted \\"Canta Napoli! Napoli in fiore\\". This became his battle cry, perfectly adapted to all the songs he performed, most of them narrated in first person such as \\"Pigliate 'na pastiglia\\" (\\"Napoli in farmacia!\\") and \\"Caravan petrol\\" (\\"Napoli petrolifera!\\"). On 5 January 1957 Carosone and his band began in Cuba a phenomenally successful American tour, concluded with a triumphant concert at the Carnegie Hall in New York. After Carosone retirement (on 7 September 1960) Di Giacomo carried on for a while solo, appearing at the 1961 Festival of Naples and in 1962 after forming his own group. Alas, not having had much success, he also decided to bid farewell to showbusiness, just making an appearance beside his friend Renato, after his return to public performances, on 9 August 1975.  Personal life  On his eighty-fifth birthday, the President of the Campania Region, Antonio Bassolino, and the councilor Teresa Amato gave him the Premio Carosone Poggioreale at his home, where he died two years later.

McGivern was a finalist in the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the 2012 Paralympic Games as well as various IPC World and European Swimming Championships. He competes in the S9 classification in his main event, the 100m backstroke retiring after a third place and bronze medal at the IPC Swimming World Championships in Montreal 2013. Personal Laurence was born on 22 September 1992 with various defects in both of his legs which resulted in their amputation, just below the knee. He is now able to walk with the aid of two prosthetic legs. Laurence took to many sports and hobbies, including; Gaelic Football, Athletics, Judo, Trampolining, Irish Dancing and ultimately Swimming. He attended the Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School in Newry, Northern Ireland, refining his sporting abilities and further realising his potential in swimming. He was also heavily involved in academic work and Is a talented musician and performer. McGivern soon joined Newry & Mourne ASC Swimming Club and competed at district, county and regional levels, including various open meets throughout the year. In 2012, after successfully completing A level examinations, he moved to Belfast where he was accepted to study Accounting with French at Queen's University Belfast and then went on to do a MSc in finance. As a student in university he trained with Invictus, one of Ireland's premier competitive swimming clubs and continued to balance academics with his sporting career. He was also elected as Treasurer of Queen's Musical theatre Society (QMTS), where he successfully received funding to produce a musical along with President, Hannah Le Fevre Taylor. Swimming Laurence competed in the International Paralympic Committee's S9 (freestyle, backstroke and butterfly) SB8 (breaststroke) and SM9 (individual medley) classifications; which is said to consist of swimmers with a severe leg weakness, swimmers with slight coordination problems and swimmers with one limb loss. McGivern started swimming when he was still in primary school and after a few years his potential was recognised by Paralympics Ireland. He soon joined Newry & Mourne ASC Swimming Club to develop his talent and as his love for the sport grew, he dedicated more and more time to training, and set a goal to one day compete in the Paralympic Games. He competed at various local and national meets for the first few years of his training, setting and maintaining the current Irish S9 records in all strokes, before eventually qualifying for Senior IPC European and World Swimming championships and even the Commonwealth Games and Paralympic Games. 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships In 2013 Laurence took Bronze in the 100m backstroke at the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships in Montr√©al, Canada. The event saw Ireland's largest ever haul at a Paralympic swimming meet. McGivern was the fourth fastest qualifier going into the final, having swam a time of 1.06.18 in the heat (close to his previous best of 1:05.35 which he swam at the Paralympic Games in London in 2012, in eighth place). He then went on to swim a personal best time of 1.04.75 in the final, finishing ahead of Paralympic Games bronze medallist Xiaobing Liu of China and Australia's Brenden Hall and claiming his first major international medal. 2012 London Paralympic Games After just qualifying at the last second for the S9 100m Backstroke, McGivern represented Ireland at the London 2012 Paralympic Games where he ended up making it through to the final.

The band was established in the city of Parma. Bernardo Lanzetti, leader and vocalist of the band, is best known for his work with Premiata Forneria Marconi and has played in many other progressive rock acts, including neoprogressive band Mangala Vallis. History The first lineup of the band, named \\"Gli Immortali\\" (\\"The Immortals\\") comprised Bernardo Lanzetti (vocals), Gino Campanini (electric guitar), Piero Canavera (drums), Maurizio Mori (keyboards) and Franz Dondi (bass guitar). Of those, Dondi was the most established musician, as he had formerly played in another small band, \\"I Moschettieri\\" (\\"The Musketeers\\") which had released a single and opened for Rolling Stones. At the beginning of the 1970s, Gli Immortali were noticed by members of the PFM (one of most successful italian rock bands of the times), and PFM's manager Franco Mamone adopted Lanzetti's group as well, which had by then changed its name to \\"Acqua Fragile\\". With Mamone's help, Acqua Fragile were hired to open for progressive rock prominent acts such as Soft Machine, Uriah Heep and Gentle Giant. In 1973 the band released a first, eponymous album for independent record label Numero Uno. This debut work was clearly inspired by British progressive rock bands Genesis and Gentle Giant, and had English lyrics, something quite unusual for Italian bands at the time, even more so since the album was not released outside of Italy. Even Lanzetti's voice sounded very much like that of Peter Gabriel. The next album Mass Media Stars (1974) was released in both Italy and the United States, a move that was intended to leverage from PFM's recent success overseas. At about the same time the new keyboardist Joe Vescovi (formerly with The Trip) moved in. Shortly thereafter Lanzetti, leader and vocalist of the band, left to join PFM for their next album Chocolate Kings. The band replaced Lanzetti with Roby Facini (former member of Top 4 and Dik Dik), but this did not revive the success of Acqua Fragile. The band eventually split in 1975. After the breakup, Acqua Fragile members pursued independent projects. Lanzetti has had a relatively successful solo career and later joined neoprogressive group Mangala Vallis. Dondi and Canavera played in several groups (including a Beatles tribute band). Dondi has recently founded a new project, called \\"Acqua Fragile Project\\", as a revival act in honor of Acqua Fragile.

He made his reputation in South Africa, where he worked for the Daily Mail and later for Drum magazine. He was the only photographer to document the massacre at Sharpeville in 1960, and his photographs were used in the trial to prove the victims' innocence. Ian Berry was also invited by Henri Cartier-Bresson to join Magnum Photos in 1962 when he was based in Paris; five years later he became a full member. Early life Berry was born in Preston, Lancashire, England. Photography career He moved to South Africa in 1952, where he soon taught himself photography. He worked under the tutelage of Roger Madden, a South African photographer who had been an assistant to Ansel Adams. After some time as an amateur photographer, Berry began photographing communities and weddings. During this period he met J√ºrgen Schadeberg, also a European immigrant and photographer. Schadeberg was offered a position with the new African Sunday newspaper eGoli but declined, suggesting Berry apply for the position instead. After working there only 10 months, the newspaper closed, and Berry began working for the Benoni City Times, but he soon became more interested in freelance work. Berry returned to Great Britain and traveled for some time but returned to South Africa in the early 1960s and worked for the Daily Mail. Later Tom Hopkinson, previously editor of the British Picture Post, hired Berry to work for Drum magazine. He was in Sharpeville on 21 March 1960, when a peaceful protest turned violent, leading to the deaths of 69 people and the wounding of 178 others by police. There were no other photographs documenting the events, and Berry's were entered into evidence in the court proceedings proving that the victims had done nothing wrong. Berry was invited by Henri Cartier-Bresson to join Magnum Photos in 1962 when he was based in Paris; five years later he became a full member. In 1964 he moved to London and began working for Observer Magazine. He has since traveled the globe, documenting social and political strife in China, Republic of Congo, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Israel, Ireland, Vietnam, and the former Soviet Union.He has contributed to publications including Esquire, Fortune, Geo, Life, National Geographic, Paris-Match, and Stern. Berry's photographs have been exhibited world-wide and some are now included in the Magnum Photos: Photographic Collection at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin.

It was similar in design to the Wright Model R with a 6-60 motor. The Model D could fly 66.9 mph and climb 525 feet per minute, but its excessive landing speed discouraged the Army from ordering more. Development The aircraft was built to fulfill a request by the United States Army for a speed scout. Design The single seat aircraft was made from ash and spruce wood coated with aluminum powder. It used forward mounted finlets (\\"blinkers\\" in Wright terminology) to stabilize the aircraft. It was powered by the last six cylinder engine built by the Wright Brothers with a rubber band drive on the flywheel. The 406 cubic inch engine ran at 1,400 to 1560rpm powering two counterrotating propellers via chains. Operational history Orville Wright considered the Model D ‚Äúthe easiest to control of any we have ever built‚Äù with the exception of the high landing speed. The United States Army acquired two aircraft in August 1912. One of the two was wrecked and rebuilt during trials. On May 3, 1913 the \\"speed scout\\" S.C. no 19 was accepted, and on June 6, 1913 the second aircraft was accepted. Both were not flown regularly and were retired in 1914.

Yungneung is the tomb of Crown Prince Sado and Princess Hyegyeong, while Geolleung houses King Jeongjo and Queen Hyoui. The tombs are part of the UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site of the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty. Yungneung Crown Prince Sado (1735-1762), having been killed by his father King Yeongjo, was buried on Mr Baebongsan in Yangju. In 1789, his body was moved to its current location, then called Hyeollyungwon, by his son King Jeongjo. In 1816, Prince Sado's wife, Princess Hyegyeong, was buried with her husband. In 1899, when Prince Sado and Princess Hyegyeong were posthumously elevated in status and given the titles Emperor Yangjo and Empress Heonyeong, the tomb was also upgraded and renamed Yungneung. The tomb itself features retaining stones around its perimeter and is decorated by capstones featuring prominent carved lotuses, possibly to soothe the spirit of Prince Sado, whom his son believed was killed before reaching his full potential. The tomb is guarded by statues on the downward slope, at the bottom of which sits a shrine, which is in turn led to by a wide worship road. There are two other buildings in the immediate vicinity: a royal kitchen and a shelter for two memorial steles. The memorial road is accessed via a red spiked wooden gateway, which stands a short distance from a circular pond. This, symbolising the wish-granting bead of a dragon, and therefore King Jeongjo's love of his father, is an unusual feature for a royal tomb from the Joseon era. Annual memorial rites are held here on the second Sunday of April. Geolleung On his death in 1800, King Jeongjo was buried on a hill to the east of Yungneung, then called Hyeollyungwon, but on the death of his wife, Queen Hyoui, his body was exhumed and moved to the current site, Geolleung, where the couple were buried together. The tomb matches Yungneung in layout, though with only one stele and without the pond. Memorial rites are performed here on the second Sunday of May each year. Tomb Keeper's House The tomb keeper's house, by the park entrance, consists of two buildings in a walled courtyard containing an old Chinese juniper and a Korean plum yew.

Named for a wartime quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many of the topics were still classified and he was denied access to British war records. The material in the book is predominantly based on oral testimony as well as some American records, declassified toward the end of Brown's research. Critical reception has been mixed, but generally negative. Contemporary historians, such as Charles B. MacDonald, praised the work ‚Äì although some did comment on its length. Modern reviewers have identified inconsistencies or errors in the material, based on later declassified records. Also, some of Brown's personal conclusions have been questioned. Background Memorandum on Bodyguard, dated February 1944 Bodyguard of Lies was Brown's first published book, following his career as a journalist in the United Kingdom and Australia. The work narrates Allied deception strategy on the Western Front for the years of 1943 and 1944. It particularly focuses on Operation Bodyguard; both the operation and the book's title were inspired by one of Winston Churchill's wartime epigrams; \\"In war-time, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.\\"Discussion of Operation Overlord with Stalin at the Teheran Conference November 30, 1943; in Winston Churchill: The Second World War, Volume V : Closing the Ring (1952), Chapter 21 (Teheran: The Crux), p. 338. Brown began researching and writing Bodyguard of Lies in 1961. Most of the material is based on oral testimony from Second World War intelligence personnel, as well as records from the National Archives and declassified American records (although Brown says that most of the book was written before he was able to access the latter, in 1974). Brown wrote Bodyguard of Lies at a time when details of both cryptography and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was resisted by the British and American governments; he was denied access to British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via Freedom of Information requests. Synopsis Insignia for the fictional FUSAG (\\"First US Army Group\\") Bodyguard of Lies opens with an introduction to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. It goes on to document the origins of the London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes with a discussion of how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed. The third section of the book covers Allied deceptions during 1943, in particular Operation Mincemeat. Brown introduces Plan Jael, the early revision of Operation Bodyguard, and follows Bevan's work in creating the deception plan. The fourth section covers the events of early 1944, leading up to the Normandy landings on 6 June. In particular, Brown discusses Operation Fortitude and the fictional First US Army Group, a key part of Bodyguard, calling it \\"the greatest charade in history\\". The final section of the book covers events on and after D-Day, including physical deceptions carried out on the night of the invasion, and the continued impact of Bodyguard in the months after the landings. Critical reception The book received mixed reviews, particularly with regard to Brown's focus on minutiae, which received both positive and negative comment. Later reviewers also criticised the factual basis of the work ‚Äì describing it as containing \\"a multitude of errors of detail\\" ‚Äì with some reviewers rejecting Brown's analysis. One such error that Brown relates was a then-widely held theory that Churchill had known of German intentions to bomb Coventry in November 1940, but that the British leader had hidden the information to avoid giving up the secrets of Ultra (intercepted German communications). By 1976, declassified records showed that the intelligence was in fact more vague than popular myth had suggested. Writing in 1996, reviewer Russell J. Bowen ascribes this to Brown's reliance on secondary sourcing and oral interviews (describing the book as an \\"outstanding example of scholarly investigative journalism applied to the field of oral military history\\"). Hugh Trevor-Roper, writing for The New York Review of Books, was highly critical of the \\"encyclopedic\\" detail in Brown's writing: \\"He piles on the illustrative (or irrelevant) detail. He cannot leave anything out. Every person mentioned must have a potted biography. Every place must be equipped with atmosphere, furniture, associations.\\" Roper also criticised the material, writing that Brown had inserted \\"a novel thesis\\", that Allied deception during the war was controlled by MI6, \\"which, in my opinion, is quite wrong.\\" Some critiques of the book have been positive. A 1976 New Scientist review praised the level of detail, saying that it \\"would ensure a large sale\\". In a letter to the editor in reply, Deputy Chief Historian for the United States Army, Charles B. MacDonald, referred to the book as \\"the most important work on World War II in a quarter of a century.\\" Writing in Military Review, Alexander Cochran noted that the book was one of the first non-memoir accounts of intelligence operations during the war and was unusual (for its genre) in documenting sources. However, he went on to call the book \\"suggestive more than definitive\\". Russell J. Bowen concludes that although the writing and coverage were better than similar books then available, \\"Cave Brown's work fails to escape the common stigma of intelligence narratives: considerable inaccuracy as to detail and occasional lack of validity of interpretation.\\" References=Bibliography    Category:1975 non-fiction books Category:History books about World War II Category:Military deception during World War II ","title":"Bodyguard of Lies"},{"id":"29163160","text":"is a railway station on the Ky≈´dai Main Line operated by JR Kyushu in Kusu, ≈åita Prefecture, Japan.

Club career Pealling attended Haggerston School and was spotted by Arsenal Ladies manager Vic Akers during a five-a-side tournament when she was 13. At the time of her retirement in 2006, Pealling was the club's longest serving player, the record appearance holder and had won the most trophies. She won domestic trebles with Arsenal in 1993 and 2001. Pealling worked as a sports development officer for Camden Council and since 2004 has coached at Hampstead FC. When Jayne Ludlow retired in July 2013, the legendary Welsh midfielder paid tribute to \\"unsung hero\\" Pealling in an interview with the Arsenal website: \\"I should really thank Kirsty because when I was scoring 30 goals a season, it was mostly because of her crosses from the right wing.\\" International career Eighteen-year-old Pealling made her England debut in a 3‚Äì0 Euro 1995 qualifying win in Belgium in November 1993. She also featured in the eventual semi-final defeat to Germany. However, Pealling and Joanne Broadhurst were controversially dropped from the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup squad, with manager Ted Copeland saying \\"They are not international footballers at this level.\\" After a long spell out of international football, Pealling returned as a substitute against Denmark in August 2001. In May 2004 she played the first half of a 1‚Äì0 friendly win over Iceland at London Road, Peterborough.

He is best known for his work on \\"The Naughty Rude Show\\", a comedic look at the sexual lives of young people.  Student Youth Network Anthony was a part of the Student Youth Network. SYN radio broadcasts in Melbourne on the 90.7 FM frequency, as well as internationally, live streaming on the Internet, at the SYN Website. In 2007 he was SYN's first Creative Director.  Early Radio  Porcelain Slap was Anthony's first radio show. He and his co-host Hugh R. Macdonald hosted the sketch comedy show late Sunday nights in 2005. Anthony soon graduated to the station's flagship drive-time show, The Wind Up. During his tenure on the drive show he took part in various publicity stunts including a campaign to put his co-host onto Neighbours. In 2006 Anthony became heavily involved in The Naughty Rude Show, an informal look at sex and relationships that allowed listeners to SMS questions into the studio. The show started rotating young people around in guest-hosting roles to offer a variety of different viewpoints and opinions. In his time at SYN radio Anthony was also involved with popular shows Sketchy at Best, Panorama and Pen Island, as well as the Get Cereal Breakfast Show.  Get Cereal Breakfast Show  Anthony was the first Executive Producer of SYN's new Breakfast Show, Get Cereal. First airing on Monday 26 February 2007, the show featured the same three hosts volunteering five days a week from 6am - a first for the station. The show was designed to showcase the diversity of SYN.  Naughty Rude Television  In 2009 Anthony wrote, directed, produced and anchored a television version of \\"The Naughty Rude Show\\" for Channel 31. The show was produced for and by young people and dealt with taboo sexual topics in a light but respectful manner. The show hit a chord with viewers at a time when Channel 31 was being denied a digital broadcast license. The program was often cited as an example of the relevance of the channel and the necessity to grant it a digital license. Channel 31 was finally granted a digital license in November 2009. \\"The Naughty Rude Show\\" won two Antenna Awards in 2010: one for Best Youth Program which Anthony accepted, as well as Best Female Presenter for host Jackie Doran.  31 Questions and Beyond  Starting in 2012, McCormack served as moderator for the community TV game/comedy show 31 Questions all three seasons it aired. In addition to announcing prizes at the end of the show, McCormack served as a player in skits, writer, editor, and judge, jury, and executioner of all decisions. He also provided a fair amount of comedy. McCormack was known for his catchphrase, \\"YYYYYYYYYeeeeeesssssssssss,\\" in addition to an impressive pair of sideburns. Since 31 Questions, McCormack has been co-host of the Channel 31 political satire show, the Leak. He has also been host of the Leak's spinoff satire quiz show, Quiz Night,\\"The Leak Quiz Night: Episode 1 - Part 1\\", 31 October 2017 since its inception in the fall of 2017.

CCISUA primarily represents member interests in inter- agency bodies that make decisions and recommendations on conditions of service. There are three labour federations serving unions and staff associations in the UN system, the other organisations being FICSA and UNISERV.  Objectives  CCISUA's main objectives are as follows: 1\\\\. To promote the common interest of international civil servants of all categories whose staff unions/associations are members of CCISUA. 2\\\\. To provide a means for staff representative bodies with common concerns to consult with one another both formally and informally with a view to reaching consensus on issues affecting conditions of service and staff welfare. 3\\\\. To permit those staff unions, associations, and other staff representative bodies of the system to address advisory and decision-making bodies with a united voice and in particular to participate actively in the work of ICSC, HR Network, HLCM, CEB, the Pension Board, and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly. 4\\\\. To assist each other in finding solutions to common problems and in monitoring the implementation of decisions affecting the staff both at Headquarters duty stations and in the field. 5\\\\. To cooperate with other staff groups with a view to formally arriving at common positions on matters affecting staff welfare. 6\\\\. To adhere to the spirit of solidarity and support for each member whenever needed. Industrial relations in the UN system Unions and staff associations of the United Nations system are unique because UN staff do not have a single employer: they are employed by the 193 member states. Because they work for an international agency, they are not protected by any national labour legislation or international conventions. Although freedom of association is written into the UN staff regulations, national unions are not recognised, and terms and conditions are negotiated directly with representatives of the member states. The first collective agreement recognised by the UN system was signed with CCISUA affiliate ILO Staff Union in 2000. UN Staff Regulation (SR) 8.1 allows for staff representative bodies to be established at each UN organisation or mission and for those bodies to represent the interests of the staff. Each UN mission or organisation has established its own union or staff association, and these are affiliated to either CCISUA or FICSA. Issues for UN staff UN staff face many of the same issues as workers in national economies, and CCISUA affiliates represent both blue-collar staff - such as security guards - as well as white-collar UN civil servants. CCISUA affiliates do not represent UN Peacekeepers, who are made up of military and police personal contributed by member states. There are a number of industrial relations issues that are peculiar to working within the UN system. The most important of these is perhaps the fact that UN staff are not protected by labour legislation, which means that all conditions need to be negotiated directly with employer representatives. Also of great concern are the dangers to staff working in areas of conflict and other non-secure locations. Many UN staff are killed in the line of duty. Another area of concern is the prevalence of short-term contracts in the UN system, the lack of job security and long-term career development. Affiliation CCISUA shares fraternal links with the wider labour movement through its affiliation to the GFTU, and through the GFTU to the European Trade Union Confederation and the International Trade Union Confederation. Membership Trade unions and staff associations of the following UN and international organisations are affiliated to CCISUA. *UNICEF *International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia *International Criminal Court *International Labour Organization *International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda *United Nations University *United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean *United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia *United Nations Economic Commission for Africa *United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific *United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees *United Nations Industrial Development Organization *UN Nairobi Staff Union *UNOG Staff Coordinating Council (UN Staff Union Geneva) *UN Staff Union New York *UN Staff Union Vienna *World Food Programme Acknowledgements Some information for this article was taken from a Masters thesis by Rick Cottam, President of the ICTY Staff Union.

Job von Witzleben claimed that he was not personally involved in the 20 July Plot and that he was not made privy to its planning. Yet, under the new Sippenhaft laws and after his uncle was executed, he was interrogated by the Gestapo. Though nothing came of the investigation, he was temporarily discharged from the Wehrmacht. He was then recalled and relegated back to the Eastern Front; Witzleben told an interviewer that he was expected to \\"prove himself once more.\\" He was appointed as First Staff Officer, a role roughly equivalent to that of an operations officer, of the 69th Infantry Division on 26 February 1945.The 69.

In early April, the corps' chief of staff informed Witzleben that he is to be flown out of the pocket and face court-martial in Vienna, that would probably result in an execution. Witzleben ordered a radio operator to contact the Soviets. On 9 April, he met with a Soviet delegation which crossed the lines and defected to the Red Army.

Google Energy, the investment firm Good Energies, and Japanese trading firm Marubeni announced that they were investing \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" in the initial development stage of what could become a $5 billion project.Ovide, Shira. \\"Google's Wind Project Got Lift From Vail Ski Trip\\" The Wall Street Journal, October 12, 2010. Accessed October 16, 2010. Financing for the project never lined up, reportedly because the low cost of natural gas made large scale offshore wind uncompetitive.https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060109405 The project continued to move forward as of May 2012 and in January, 2013 with plans to build the first segment off New Jersey. Project description The Atlantic Wind Connection would begin with a first phase that would connect population and power transmission hubs in southern New Jersey and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the site of a proposed offshore wind project with a Power Purchase Agreement.Agreement reached on Delaware Wind Farm The Washington Post, June 24, 2008. Accessed October 16, 2010. Power would be carried with a cable placed in trenches on the seabed offshore. With an estimated cost of $1.7 billion, phase one would begin construction in 2015. The remaining southern connection to Norfolk, Virginia and an extension to Gateway Region of northern New Jersey and New York City would bring total construction costs to $5 billion and could be completed by 2021. The lead partners Google and Good Energies would each own 37.5% of the project, while Marubeni would have a 15% share. The project was proposed to deliver power ashore in southern Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, southern New Jersey and northern New Jersey using of cable as a backbone that could be used by wind power systems built miles off of the Atlantic Ocean coast. Initially the system could be used to transport electricity from southern Virginia, where it is cheap, to the New York City area, where it is comparatively expensive. The system would be able to transmit 6,000 megawatts of power and would allow existing energy supplies in Virginia to be transmitted north, bypassing the congested energy grid that exists in the Northeast, in an area that has been identified as one of the most congested portions of the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor. The system's energy transmission capacity would be a \\"superhighway for clean energy\\" to serve approximately 1.9 million households, equal to 60% of the wind energy generation capacity that existed in the United States as of 2009.Needham, Rick. \\"The wind cries transmission\\", Google, October 11, 2010. Accessed October 12, 2010.Wilgoren, Debbi. \\"Google helps finance 'superhighway' for wind power\\", The Washington Post, October 12, 2010. Once the backbone is constructed, wind farms constructed well off the coast and almost invisible from the shore could be constructed and tap into the backbone. By constructing the cable beyond the limit where states wield authority, the system would be under the federal jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Interior. Initial phase off New Jersey As of January, 2013 a proposal to seek approval for construction of the initial leg off New Jersey was announced. Construction of this phase responds to a need to equalize power costs between southern and northern New Jersey, provide statutorily required renewable energy, and, by limiting the project to one state, simplify regulatory and permitting issues. Construction of the 189 mile project, which would stretch from the vicinity of Jersey City to near Atlantic City, would begin in 2015 if regulatory approval was obtained. On January 17, 2013 Atlantic Wind Connection announced it had selected Bechtel as the EPC contractor and Alstom as technical advisor for the first phase of the development. Studies completed in 2012 concluded that a new marine terminal at the Port of Paulsboro is well suited to become a center for the manufacture, assembly, and transport of wind turbines to be used to further the development of wind power in New Jersey. Opinions The proposed system has been praised by environmentalists and federal regulators, with Jon Wellinghoff, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) calling it \\"one of the most interesting transmission projects that I've ever seen walk through the door\\", saying that the system \\"provides a gathering point for offshore wind for multiple projects up and down the coast.\\" Former FERC chairman James J. Hoecker, who heads a group that represents power transmission system owners called the proposal \\"a necessary piece of what the Eastern governors have been talking about in terms of taking advantage of offshore wind\\" and noted that the system would help average out the variable output of wind farms. Google's director of its green business operations group, Richard L. Needham, called the project \\"an opportunity to kick-start this industry and, long term, provide a way for the mid-Atlantic states to meet their renewable energy goals.\\" Melinda Pierce of the Sierra Club said that she had opposed other power line projects but would support the Atlantic Wind Connection, as \\"These kinds of audacious ideas might just be what we need to break through the wretched logjam\\". The concept of an offshore transmission backbone coordinated with several projects was an item in a speech by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar a week before AWC was announced,Salazar, Ken. \\"Secretary Salazar Promotes Clean Energy, Signs Cape Wind Lease at AWEA Conference\\", United States Department of the Interior, October 6, 2010. Accessed October 16, 2010. and the concept is also a part of the national strategy on offshore wind power.A national offshore wind strategy: Creating an offshore wind energy industry in the United States page 33 U.S. Department of Energy, 7 February 2011. Accessed: 8 February 2011. Challenges However, as the first such project of this nature, it poses significant risks of encountering unexpected technological challenges, bureaucratic backlogs and cost overruns. Virginia politicians have opposed previous proposals that would send low-cost energy out of the state. PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization that covers the area and is the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market, would need to develop a formula to assess its customers for the costs associated with hooking up the new cables, increasing grid capacity and making the system more reliable. Resource area The project would take advantage of the fact that the continental shelf slopes rather gradually in the Atlantic Ocean and that it would not be exposed to the freezing temperatures characteristic of the Great Lakes. The Mid-Atlantic Bight offers the potential of 60,000 megawatts of wind power generating capacity in an area that has relatively little renewable energy potential from other sources. The resource area, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, was identified and mapped in 2006Kempton et al. Large CO2 reductions via offshore wind power matched to inherent storage in energy end-uses, University of Delaware, November 4, 2006. Accessed October 16, 2010. by Willett M. Kempton of the University of Delaware, and again in 2008 in the Journal of Marine Research. Twenty-one years of hourly data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoy anemometers show an extrapolated mean wind speed of 8.3 m/s at 80 m height, giving a capacity factor of 39% for oceanic turbines (36% for coastal). A single offshore site had zero wind 15% of the time. Considering three connected offshore sites in a larger area between North Carolina (34¬∞ N) and Massachusetts (43¬∞ N), zero power occurred 2% of the time. For six connected offshore sites, zero power occurred 0.3% of the time. Baseload fossil fuel generating plants are typically unavailable 6% of the time. The principal difference is that wind power is a non-dispatchable resource, not that it is \\"unreliable\\".

The building was built in 1859 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 26, 1990. Its oldest portion dates to 1859, built to a design by Gridley J. F. Bryant, and was the county's first purpose-built court facility. Later additions in 1895 (designed by Maine architect Wilfred E. Mansur) and 1928 added wings that give the building its present shape. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Aroostook County Courthouse and Jail is a sprawling complex occupying about half of a city block in the center of Houlton, Maine. The original 1859 courthouse is a rectangular brick block, with a bell-shaped mansard roof, and a cupola that now also includes a clock; the latter is an addition made during the 1895 additions to the building, in which the cupola was moved to the new center of the building. The front facade, facing west, has a central entrance pavilion, three bays wide, topped by a gable-on-mansard pediment. The entrance is in the center bay, sheltered by a portico supported by paired columns. Windows on this facade are set in slightly-recessed round-arch openings. The original 1859 entrance faces south (toward Military Street), is framed by pilasters and a segmented-arch pediment. Aroostook County was established in 1839, during a period of heightened tension over the exact location of the border with neighboring New Brunswick. County offices were at first rented in a variety of spaces in Houlton, including the Blackhawk Putnam Tavern, the town's oldest surviving building. In 1858 the county commissioners retained Gridley J. F. Bryant, then working in Boston, to design a courthouse. The building completed in 1859 is now the southernmost part of the complex. In 1895 Wilfred E. Mansur, a Bangor architect, was retained to design an addition, which extended this building to the north, using Bryant's design vocabulary, and moved the cupola to the new center of the building and adding its clock. It also replaced the existing jail, a separate structure standing on the property since at least 1877. At this time Mansur also designed a secondary Aroostook County Courthouse in Caribou.American Architect and Building News 9 March 1895: xiii. Boston. In 1928 a new addition to the north doubled the size of the building, and reoriented it to face toward court street, again relocating the cupola.

The plane, carrying three crew members and twelve scientists, was en route to Anadyr, USSR. Due to strong winds, the pilot decided to divert to Provideniya, USSR, which was fogged in. The aircraft was low on fuel, so the crew chose to divert to Gambell, USA, located 62 miles southeast of Provideniya, USSR, across the Bering Sea. The plane made a straight-in approach, and one of the engines quit shortly before landing due to fuel starvation. Word quickly spread around the community that a Soviet plane had landed, and this prompted villagers to come out to the airfield. There was a friendly meeting between Russians and locals, and souvenirs were exchanged. Some locals banded together to bring space heaters and food for the Russian visitors. The incident took place during the height of the Cold War era. An Alaska State Trooper and members of the Alaska National Guard from Nome were dispatched to provide security for the plane. The Soviet Embassy in Washington was aware of the diversion and contacted the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense and requested fuel for the stranded plane. A U.S. Air Force C-130 plane with fuel bladders took on a load of JP-1 fuel at Anchorage and flew directly to Gambell, where it refueled the plane.

Commissioned by Rochdale's local industrialist and Freemason Albert Royds, the construction of the building was completed to a high and rich specification in 1873, with an \\"enormous\\" cost of around ¬£25,000 (¬£ in ). It is the only known church building in England so overtly dedicated to Masonic symbolism and is therefore unique within English architecture. Art critic Nikolaus Pevsner described the building as \\"Rochdale's temple to Freemasonry, a total concept as exotic as Roslin Chapel in Scotland\\". Because of the building's craftsmanship, design and prevalent Masonic theme, St Edmund's Church was recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building in 1985. The church closed for worship in 2007, and in 2009, The Victorian Society identified the building as \\"unusual and extraordinary\\" but also critically endangered. St Edmund's heritage status was upgraded to a Grade I listing in 2010 in recognition of its unique Masonic architecture and exceptional architectural interest. It has since been acquired by the Churches Conservation Trust. History St Edmund's Church was commissioned by Albert Hudson Royds, an industrialist, banker and Freemason who belonged to Rochdale's prominent Royds family of wool merchants, financiers of the Rochdale Canal. Royds acquired a crossroads at the highest point of Rochdale and commissioned the Manchester- based practice of James Medland and Henry Taylor to design and construct a new church building \\"at a time when Freemasonry in Rochdale was a strong force and its members were stalwarts of the local community\\". The building was constructed between 1870-1873 at a cost between ¬£22,000 (¬£ in ), and ¬£28,000 (¬£ in ), at a time when a suitable parish church could have been built for ¬£4,000 (¬£ in ). Features References to the traditions of Masonry are everywhere at St Edmund's, in the weathervane and lectern in particular. The interior of the church is designed around the geometric form of a cube. A hammerbeam roof springs from the walls and is decorated with the Masonic symbols of pomegranates, lilies and water lilies. The church has an \\"elaborate set\\" of stained glass windows with the Masonic theme on the south side of the building dedicated to building and Freemasonry. The Masonic theme climaxes in Royds Chapel, where the window depicts Nehemiah, Ezra and the Tyler, the guard of a Masonic Lodge, wielding the Tyler's sword. Solomon's Temple is shown with a likeness of Albert Hudson Royds as one of the master masons. In the main body of the church, the lectern features three brass columns all with the symbolic tools of masoncraft engraved on the base. Heritage status Many churches in Rochdale display reference to Freemasonry but none so prominently as St Edmund‚Äôs. The church was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1985. The Victorian Society, the United Kingdom's national charity responsible for the study and protection of Victorian and Edwardian arts and architecture, identified the building as \\"unusual and extraordinary\\" but also critically endangered, placing it among the nation's top-10 endangered buildings. The building was upgraded to a Grade I listed building in September 2010 largely due it being a rare example of Masonic architecture on a church, as opposed to a Masonic Lodge. Nick Bridgland, Heritage Protection Team Leader for English Heritage in northern England said that \\"St Edmunds is unique as it merges the architectural style of Gothic revival with Masonic symbolism to create a building which is not only a successful parish church but also a temple to Freemasonry. The completeness of the Masonic scheme is unparalleled in England and the importance of this building is reflected in its Grade I listing\\".

He was the eldest son of Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow and Lady Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of the Marquess of Huntly who died giving birth to him.Robert Gordon, Genealogical history of the Earldom of Sutherland (Edinburgh, 1813), p. 335. Among his siblings was sister Lady Margaret Livingston, who married Sir Thomas Nicholson, 2nd Baronet. After his death, she married, as his fourth wife, Sir George Stirling, 6th of Keir in 1666. After his death, she married thirdly to her late husband's cousin Sir John Stirling, 8th of Keir on 6 February 1668. His mother was the second daughter of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly and Lady Henrietta Stuart (eldest daughter of Esm√© Stuart, 1st Duke of Lennox). His paternal grandparents were Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow and Lady Helen Hay (the eldest daughter of Andrew Hay, 8th Earl of Erroll). His paternal uncle was James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar. Career He was appointed constable and keeper of Linlithgow Palace on his father's resignation on 15 December 1642.Date is not confirmed by documentation. Charter in favour of George dated 17 June 1640, registered 20 December 1642 (Scottish Records Society, The Binns Papers, 205). His father died between 11 June and 20 December 1648, and his succession to the earldom. On 4 December 1650, George was admitted to the House of Parliament, and his incapability by his accession to the 'Engagement' for the rescue of Charles taken off.Sir James Balfour, Annals, iv. p. 198.

At the Restoration, he was appointed colonel of the Scots Regiment of Foot Guards, and sworn a Privy Councillor.see Dalton's \\"The Scots Army 1661-1688\\" at intro, p xvi On 18 December 1677 he obtained a commission to succeed Sir George Munro, 1st of Newmore as major-general of the forces in Scotland, his principal duty being the suppression of covenanting conventicles. After the defeat of Claverhouse at Drumclog on 1 June 1679, Linlithgow acted very irresolutely. The forces of Claverhouse were directed to return to the main body under him at Stirling, and without daring to risk an engagement, he finally fell back on Edinburgh until assistance could be obtained from England. On the arrival of the English reinforcements the supreme command was transferred to Monmouth. After the battle of Bothwell Bridge Linlithgow, on 25 July, was sent by the council along with Claverhouse to London to advocate the adoption of more severe measures against those who had been in arms. On 10 July 1684, he was appointed justice-general in room of the Earl of Perth,Fountainhall, Hist. Notices, p. 542) but he was deprived of his office at the Revolution. Linlithgow had some connection with the Montgomery plot, but died before its betrayal. Personal life On 30 July 1650, he married Lady Elizabeth Lyon, the widow of John Lyon, 2nd Earl of Kinghorne. Lady Elizabeth was the second daughter of Patrick Maule, 1st Earl of Panmure. Together, they were the parents of two sons and one daughter: * George Livingston, 4th Earl of Linlithgow (d. 1695), who married Hon. Henrietta Sutherland, daughter of Alexander Sutherland, 1st Lord Duffus. * Alexander Livingston, 3rd Earl of Callendar (d. 1692), who married Lady Anne Graham, eldest daughter of James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose and Lady Isabel Ker (widow of Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe and fifth daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton). * Lady Henrietta Livingston, who married Robert Makgill, 2nd Viscount of Oxfuird. After the death of his first wife, he remarried in June 1677 to Agnes (n√©e Wauchope) Scott. Agnes was the widow of goldsmith Alexander Scott of Edinburgh, and daughter and co-heiress of George Wauchope of Edinburgh. After his death on 1 February 1690, he was buried in a family vault on the south side of St Michael's church in Linlithgow, west of Edinburgh. Descendants Following the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, his son-in-law and both of his sons, were accused of being rebels, arrested and imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. They were released only after taking an oath of allegiance to King William III. Through his second son, he was a grandfather of James Livingston, 5th Earl of Linlithgow and 4th Earl of Callendar as his eldest son George died without issue.

It is a blend of traditional musical forms of the Caribbean Region of Colombia, mainly vallenato, with foreign Latin genres such as salsa and merengue, and pop and pop rock. The term \\"tropipop\\" comes from the synthesis of the words \\"tropical\\" and \\"pop music\\" describing the genre's mix of Latin tropical roots with American popular music. Some popular tropipop acts are Fanny Lu, Fonseca, Bonka, Mauricio & Palodeagua, Lucas Arnau and the internationally successful Carlos Vives. History=Early development Since the early emergence of Colombian rock in the 1960s and 1970s, bands like Genesis (Colombian rock band) began to experiment fusing traditional Colombian music with pop rock. In the following decades, rock bands like Aterciopelados continued bringing elements of Colombian folklore into rock music. Carlos Vives & La Provincia Tropipop stylistic origins can be traced back to 1993 when Carlos Vives released the album Cl√°sicos de la Provincia. This very popular album was notable for the use of rock instruments like electric guitars to sing traditional Vallenato songs. Vives' and his band, La provincia, continued experimenting the fusion of vallenato and cumbia with pop, rock and funk in their subsequent albums La Tierra del Olvido and Tengo Fe. For his following album, El Amor de Mi Tierra, Vives hooked up with the successful Cuban American producer Emilio Estefan. Estefan stylized Vives music into a more pop-oriented sound, with less instrumental breaks, more prominent vocal parts, and less dominant vallenato and cumbia elements. Vives continued this sound in his next two albums, gaining a lot of success. It was this stylized fusion style, heard in Vives songs such as \\"Tu Amor Eterno\\", which was later adopted by tropipop artists. Vives' influence and success was so big that it has been said that all the artists that came after him playing fusions of pop rock and vallenato are either \\"imitators or part of the school that he formed\\".As√≠ ve Carlos Vives a sus herederos del 'tropipop' (Vives II parte). Tropipop In the early 2000s, young musicians from Bogota and other big Colombian cities, inspired by Carlos Vives' success began recording fusions of vallenato and pop rock. What a decade before would have been considered experimental, was now mainstream. The group of artists which played this style of fusion began being commercialized under the term tropipop. During the 2000s, tropipop became the most popular music genre in Colombia alongside reggaeton. Furthermore, some artists gained some success internationally. Mauricio & Palodeagua were nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2004 and Bogotan singer Fonseca won one in 2006. Criticism Due to the simplistic nature of the music, and the lack of prominence of Colombian traditional music elements in favour of pop music structures, Tropipop has been criticised by sectors of the public and the media for its lack of originality. For example, it has been said that Tropipop is \\"a cocktail that has a little bit of rock, two drops of accordion, a pinch of cumbia and a singer with a fashioned look\\".Del tropipop a la tropipeste Critics generally agree in saying that Tropipop musicians have not really investigated Colombian folklore in order to include Colombian traditional music in a genuine way. They say that the Colombian elements in tropipop are superficial. Critics usually also give preference to fusions different from Tropipop as the ones made in Carlos Vives' early albums, or the ones played by Sidestepper and Bomba Estereo. However, some critics defend the tropipop artists will to include Caribbean elements in their music.

Painted in the Futurist style, the work centres on a woman on a balcony in front of a busy street, with the sounds of the activity below portrayed as a riot of shapes and colours. The first public display of the painting was in Paris, in 1912, as part of the first Futurist exhibition. It is now housed in the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, Germany. Background Boccioni was one of the founding members of the Futurist movement.Clough, Rosa Trillo; Futurism: The Story of a Modern Art Movement, Greenwood Press (1961). pp. 22-23. Until 1910, the group concentrated primarily on capturing \\"emotion and multiple states of mind\\" using techniques derived from Neoimpressionism style (for example, Severini's The Black Cat or The Obsessive Dancer).Clough, pp. 68-70. After hearing second-hand reports of the innovations of Picasso and Braque, Boccioni and his compatriots adapted their technique to match, incorporating angular lines and intersecting planes as a way of capturing multiple viewpoints in a two- dimensional image.Glueck, Grace; \\"On a Trip Back to Futurism, Women and Settings Merge\\", The New York Times, 3 July 1998. Retrieved 12 October 2010. While this was going on, there was a corresponding shift in what the group was attempting to capture as well. They began to focus more heavily on the physical and the external rather than the emotional and internal.Rye, Jane; Futurism, Studio Vista (1972). pp. 46-48. In 1910, Boccioni began a series of works based on modern urbanism. The first, The City Rises, described the construction of a new city and the sights and sounds of men and horses at work. He described it as a \\"great synthesis of labour, light, and movement.\\"Lista, Giovanni; Futurism, Terrail (2001). p. 50. His later works, such as The Forces of the Street, The Street Enters the House, Simultaneity of Vision, and Street-pavers and A Study of a Woman Among Buildings were elaborations on the same theme. Composition and interpretation The central figure of The Street Enters the House is a woman dressed in blue and white, viewed from behind and above. She looks over her balcony at a busy street scene, a riot of colours, lines, and angles. On the road in front of her, workers lift poles to form the walls of a new building, surrounded by a pile of bricks. On every side of this construction, white and blue houses lean into the street. Two of the balconies are occupied by other figures peering down into the road. A line of horses flies past the foreground. The identity of the woman in The Street Enters the House is the subject of some debate. While several scholars postulate that she was an entirely imagined character, Boccioni had a history of employing the women of his family as models. This has led some to the conclusion that the figure is Boccioni's mother, and use the depiction in The Street Enters the House as evidence of Boccioni's changing view of women in general and mothers in particular.Poggi, Christine; Inventing futurism: the art and politics of artificial optimism, Princeton University Press (2009). pp. 165-169 Antliff, Mark; \\"The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space\\", The Art Bulletin, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Dec., 2000), pp. 730-731. The painting in general showcases Boccioni's evolution from a Neoimpressionist style to one more aligned with the ideals of Cubism, and the catalog description for the piece demonstrates his increasing fascination with scientific terminology. It includes lines such as \\"The principles of Roentgen rays is applied to the work, allowing the personages to be studied from all sides, objects both at the front and the back are in the painter's memory.\\"Tisdall, Caroline; Bozzolla, Angelo; Futurism, Thames and Hudson (1977). pp. 42-43. Boccioni experiments with Cubist techniques as a way of keeping elements in both the foreground and background \\"rushing into the window at the same time\\" He also weaves in references to his earlier works. See for example, the visual pun of the horse's appearance on the woman's buttock when compared with a line from his earlier Manifesto: \\"How often have we seen upon the cheek of the person with whom we are talking the horse which passes at the end of the street.\\" Provenance The Street Enters The House was completed after Boccioni's return from Paris in November 1911.

A prot√©g√© of vitriolic newspaper editor William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, Rule established the Journal (initially called the Chronicle) as a successor to Brownlow's Knoxville Whig. Rule twice served as mayor of Knoxville (in 1873 and 1898), and published the city's first comprehensive history, Standard History of Knoxville, in 1900.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 478-479. Early life Rule was born in rural Knox County, Tennessee, about south of Knoxville, the son of Frederick and Sarah Brakebill Rule. He occasionally attended county schools, but was largely self-educated. In 1858, Rule and his brother, James, opened a general store at the corner of State Street and Cumberland Avenue in Knoxville. By 1860, this store had closed, and William joined the staff of Brownlow's Knoxville Whig, a radical and controversial pro-Union newspaper. On November 10, 1861, in the early days of the Civil War, Rule eluded Knoxville's Confederate occupiers to carry news and messages to Brownlow, who was hiding out in Wears Valley.William Rule, The Loyalists of Tennessee in the Late War (Cincinnati: H.C.

He was elected to his first office, Knox County Court Clerk, in 1866, and was reelected in 1870, but resigned after one year. Editor In 1869, the Whig, which was the only pro-Republican newspaper in the post-bellum South, was sold to Knoxville businessman Joseph Mabry, who attempted to rebrand it as a Democratic Party newspaper. To ensure the survival of Knoxville's pro-Republican newspaper tradition, Rule left the Whig in 1870 and formed the Knoxville Chronicle, which he considered the true successor to Brownlow's paper. When Brownlow returned to Knoxville after his Senate term had ended in 1875, he purchased a half stake in the Chronicle, and the paper was published as the Whig and Chronicle until Brownlow's death in 1877. Rule was first elected Mayor of Knoxville in 1873. He spearheaded a successful initiative to establish a city waterworks, which Knoxville voters approved in June of that year. He also opened a small pox hospital on the outskirts of town, and appointed a board of health.John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, 1900; reprinted by Kessinger Books, 2010), pp. 112, 208-211. Front page of the June 27, 1872, issue of the Knoxville Chronicle During the 1880s, the Chronicle quarreled with the pro-Democratic Knoxville Tribune. On the morning of March 11, 1882, the Chronicle featured an article accusing the Tribune of publishing obscene material. That evening, James W. Wallace, editor of the Tribune, angrily accosted Rule on Gay Street, and demanded he issue a retraction. When Rule refused, Wallace proceeded to loudly issue a \\"formal denunciation\\" of Rule. As Wallace spoke, Rule bashed him over the head with a cane, whereupon Wallace drew a pistol and fired three shots, all of which missed.James B. Jones, Jr., They Couldn't Break the \\"Rules.\\" Violence and Journalism in 1880s Knoxville, Or, Mark Twain was Right. 11 July 2009. Retrieved: 11 October 2010. Both Wallace and Rule were arrested, but no charges were filed, and both editors blamed one another for the incident. Throughout the 1880s, Rule's newspaper (which after a series of ownership changes became the Knoxville Journal) was the mouthpiece for the so-called \\"Houk Machine,\\" a Republican political syndicate headed by Leonidas C. Houk (a former rival of Rule) that dominated East Tennessee politics. In 1887, Rule published a speech, \\"The Loyalists of Tennessee in the Late War,\\" which detailed the actions of East Tennessee's Unionists during the Civil War. During the same period, Rule spoke out against Appalachian stereotypes (which were beginning to take shape), arguing that people from the region had normal levels of intelligence, but suffered due to Southern states' lack of funding for schools.Mark Banker, Appalachians All: East Tennesseans and the Elusive History of an American Region (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2010), pp. 100, 140. On January 29, 1888, another violent incident involving the Rule family took place in Knoxville. After the Journal published an article questioning the competence of Dr. A. T. West, who had been appointed city physician by the Board of Aldermen, West's sons, John and William, confronted Rule's brother, James (who was an editor for the Journal), outside St. John's Episcopal Church, and demanded he reveal the article's author. When Rule refused, the Wests attacked him. Rule was shot through the wrist and stabbed before he managed to draw a pistol and fire blindly, killing John West. In 1900, Rule cowrote and edited the Standard History of Knoxville, the city's first fully comprehensive history. After Rule was again elected mayor in 1898, he sold his ownership stake in the Journal, but continued as the paper's editor.

Selznick, distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, directed by Clarence Brown and starring John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Clark Gable, Helen Hayes, Robert Montgomery and Myrna Loy.Hanson and Gevinson 1993, Volume 3. The picture is based on the 1931 novel of the same name, which won the Prix Femina the same year, by French writer and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. Based on Saint-Exup√©ry's personal experiences while flying on South American mail routes, Night Flight recreates a 24-hour period of the operations of a fictional airline based on A√©ropostale, Trans-Andean European Air Mail. In 1942, Night Flight was withdrawn from circulation as a result of a dispute between MGM and Saint Exup√©ry. Its public re-release had to wait until 2011, when legal obstacles were overcome. Plot In South America, the daunting mountains and dangerous weather have hampered the operations of Trans-Andean European Air Mail, a 1930s-era airline. Charged with delivering a serum to stem an outbreak of infantile paralysis in Rio de Janeiro, Auguste Pellerin (Robert Montgomery) conquers his fears, but is reprimanded by the airline's stern director, A. Rivi√©re (John Barrymore) for coming in late. Determined to make the night flight program work, Rivi√©re sends pilot Jules Fabian (Clark Gable) and his wireless operator on another dangerous flight. The pair are caught in a torrential rain storm and when Madame Fabian (Helen Hayes) comes to the headquarters, she realizes that her husband is overdue. The two airmen, flying blind over the ocean, run out of fuel and choose to jump, but drown. Rivi√©re refuses to quit and orders a Brazilian pilot (William Gargan) to take the mail to Rio, but the pilot's wife (Myrna Loy) pleads with him not to go. Despite the dangers, the night mail is delivered on time. The pilot despairs that his flight only meant that someone in Paris can get a postcard on Tuesday instead of Thursday, but its real value is proven when the serum is also delivered and a child is saved. The mother weeps for joy at her child's bedside, and the scene dissolves to two parachutes floating on the ocean. A ghostly plane appears with Fabian, smiling, at the controls. He soars up into the sky, followed by a host of phantom biplanes; the following words appear on screen: \\"And such is human courage...that men died...so others might live...and so, at last, man's empire might reach triumphant to the sky!\\" Cast * John Barrymore as Managing Director A.

Brown wanted to replace Barrymore, but was not allowed to, being overruled by studio head Louis B. Mayer. Helen Hayes also felt intimidated by Barrymore. When they filmed their scene together, Barrymore refrained from relying on cue cards, because he said that he didn't want to use a crutch in the presence of a real actress.

It is not considered part of mainstream archaeology, or taught in academic institutions. It is difficult to test scientifically, since archaeological sites are relatively abundant, and all of its verified predictions could have been made via educated guesses.Cole, John R. (1978). Anthropology Beyond the Fringe: Ancient Inscriptions, Early Man and Scientific Method. The Skeptical Inquirer 2(2): 62-71. Practitioners of psychic archaeology utilize a variety of methods of divination ranging from pseudoscientific methods such as dowsing and channeling.Feder, Kenneth L. (1980). Psychic Archaeology: The Anatomy of Irrationalist Prehistoric Studies. The Skeptical Inquirer 4(4): 32-43. Some psychic archaeologists engage in fieldwork while others, such as Edgar Cayce (who claims to have had access to ancient Akashic records), exclusively engage in remote viewing. Frederick Bligh Bond's research at Glastonbury Abbey is one of the first documented examples of psychic archaeology and remains a principal case in many discussions of psychic archaeology. Description Psychic archaeology is the use of extrasensory perception to locate sites for archaeological digs, or describe context of artifacts. Psychic archaeology is alluring for several reasons, respective to the type of psychic archaeology employed. For instance, surveying techniques such as dowsing are less costly in terms of time and equipment than conventional noninvasive surveying techniques such as Ground Penetrating Radar or magnetometery surveys. Techniques for locating sites and test pits such as automatic writing and various scrying techniques are easy to perform. Psychic archaeologists claim that many of their techniques address lives of the past directly. Whereas accepted archaeologists make inferences about lives of the past based on material culture, some psychic archaeologists say they have visions of non- material aspects of the lives they study. Methods There are several common methods employed by practitioners of psychic archaeologists including: Dowsing Dowsing rods Dowsing in psychic archaeology can take on many forms. One of the better publicized methods and the subject of psychic archaeologist Karen Hunt's 1981 masters thesis at Indiana University involves dowsing for Electromagnetic Photo-Fields (EMPF) using two L-shaped [Ferrous] coat hangers bent about 17.8 cm from the end as electromagnetic photo sensors. Hunt stated that the electromagnetic photo sensors detect EMPF similar to a proton magnetometer detecting magnetic fields. Crossed dowsing rods indicated the crossing of an EMPF, which are said to be three-dimensional patterns generated by man-made objects left in place for at least six-months. There are other methods of dowsing employed in psychic archaeology with less inherent scientism than EMPF. Often conventional dowsers will offer their services to archaeologist with varying explanation for their methods. Straddling the border of dowsing and channeling is a technique known as map dowsing, in which a medium or psychic dangles a pendulum over a map of the area of a potential dig to divine ideal locations for test pits or excavation. Psychometry Stefan Ossowiecki An example of psychometry in psychic archaeology occurred at 17:45, 22 October 1941 when Professor Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski of the University of Warsaw handed Polish psychic Stefan Ossowiecki a projectile point from the Magdalenian culture. After holding the artifact Ossowiecki stated that it was a spear point from France or Belgium, belonging to round house dwelling people with brownish skin, black hair, short stature, large hands, feet and hips wearing skins. He describes a funeral pyre, burial, and two domesticated dogs. Jeffrey Goodman, author and psychic archaeologist, considers Ossowiecki's psychometry validated for the following reasons: large hipped women are observed in Magdalenian Venus figurines, bone needles associated with Magdalenian culture may have been used to sew skin clothing, and the bearded man on the funeral pyre ‚Äúmay have been one of the bearded Magdalenians who are found represented in Magdalenian cave art.‚Äù Others * Remote viewing * Automatic writing * Precognitive dreaming * Channeling Sites=Chich√©n Itz√° Augustus Le Plongeon, an eccentric explorer who concentrated on Maya sites in the northern Yucatan Peninsula, was an early practitioner of psychic archaeology. In 1877, Juan P√©on Contreras, director of the Museo Yucateco in M√©rida, noted that Le Plongeon's discoveries of sculpture at Chich√©n Itz√° resulted from the application of \\"abstruse archaeological reasoning and... meditation.\\"., p. 131 R. Tripp Evans refers to this as \\"psychic archaeology,\\" noting that Le Plongeon's wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon had an avid interest in mesmerism, s√©ance, and the occult. Helena Blavatsky, a co-founder of the Theosophical Society, regarded the work of the Le Plongeons as proving the validity of \\"metaphysical archaeology.\\"., p. 131 However, professional archaeologists regard Le Plongeon as an obvious crank. Glastonbury Abbey Glastonbury Abbey Glastonbury Abbey was a Catholic religious complex located at Glastonbury, UK until 1539, when it was destroyed by edict of King Henry VIII. According to Frederick Bligh Bond the Abbey was founded in 166 CE, although this founding date is disputed by historians; the commonly accepted date is in the 7th Century when, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle King Ine of Wessex established a minster at Glastonbury. On November 17, 1907 F. Bligh Bond had his friend Captain John Bartlett (Given the Pseudonym John Alleyne in The Gate of Remembrance ) engage in communicating with spirits via Automatic writing for the purpose of learning about Glastonbury Abbey's past. Captain Bartlett's communication with spirits produced two sketches of the abbey's layout signed by \\"Gulielmus Monachus.\\" The layouts showed a chapel to the east of the abbey that was unknown to F. Bligh Bond, he asked that Captain Bartlett's source provide more information about this building. Accordingly, Captain Bartlett wrote that the chapel had been erected by Abbot Beere, completed by Abbot Whiting and named in honor of King Edgar. F. Bligh Bond began excavation at Glastonbury in the summer of 1909. While excavating he demonstrated the accuracy of Captain Bartlett's sketches discovering Edgar Chapel in the location indicated by Captain Bartlett. Bond didn't reveal that he was using psychic powers until 1917, when he had already presented his results. The Church of England officials were so embarrassed that they fired him. Mainstream archeologists are far from nonplussed about the discovery, reminding people that F. Bligh Bond was an expert in medieval church architecture, that most of the site had already been dug out, and that the location of the chapel could be easily guessed from the existing data. Archaeologist Stephen Williams said that \\"Culture is a patterned behavior, and medieval cathedrals are some of the most patterned pieces of construction in our culture... All he had to do was turn to almost any nearby structure, such as Salisbury Cathedral, less than fifty miles to the east, and see its Trinity Chapel behind the main altar and guess that Glastonbury would have one too. Point Cook Point Cook Australia was the location of a psychic archaeological survey by Karen A. B. Hunt M.A. in 1981. Hunt employed dowsing rods to detect Electromagnetic Photo-Fields (EMPF). Hunt mapped the locations of 129 buildings or cultural points including the house, outbuildings, a windmill, a tank stand, the fences and gates of the homestead. While the location of the windmill and tank stand match established facts, skeptic Mark Plummer considers Hunt's survey dubious for several reasons, including architectural style, which he and a team of architects find more indicative of 1870-1900 American architecture than Australian Colonial architecture. In 1985, Hunt declined to participate in a proposed scientifically controlled test of EMPF. Others * Alexandria * Ancient Egypt * Great Sphinx of Giza * Atlantis Validity Advocates of psychic archaeology believe that at best it possesses the power to answer questions about the lives in the past not answerable using the archaeological record, and also to locating prime archaeological sites. They believe that, at worst, psychic archaeologists can locate and excavate important sites that may not be excavated without the motivation of psychic guidance. Skeptics, on the other hand, usually question the existence of psychic abilities, ascribing the occasional apparent successes of psychic archaeology to fallacious thinking on the part of practitioners and cite phenomena such as coincidence, confirmation bias, cherry picking or outright trickery. Skeptics compare psychic archaeologists to psychic detectives. It is difficult to test psychic archaeology empirically, since archaeological discoveries are relatively abundant; anyone can predict the location of a site, using only a bit of archaeological knowledge and common sense. The same applies for finding objects inside an already identified site. Also, some sites, like the Alexandria harbor, are so rich in objects that one can dig in any random place and find at least one object. Predictions about the lifestyle of ancient civilizations can't be verified due to the lack of written records.

The first worker housing building in the country, designed by the architect in 1906, is located in the Zebrastraat. The building, also named the Zebrastraat after its location, remains a private project dedicated to housing, entrepreneurial, and cultural initiatives.  History  The Zebrastraat is located on land formerly occupied by the Ghent Zoo, which opened in 1851. When the zoo closed in 1905, the land was purchased by the city of Ghent, which used the land to create a new neighborhood. In recognition of the previous use of the land, several streets in the area were named after animals that were once housed at the zoo, including Elephant Street (Olifantstraat), Tiger Street (Tijgerstraat), Lion Street (Leeuwstraat) and Zebra Street (Zebrastraat). At the beginning of the 20th century, the textile industry in Ghent was booming, but many workers nevertheless suffered from poor housing conditions. The city council, along with some notable charity organizations, established the Ghent Workers Housing Company (Gentsche Maatschappij Der Werkerswoningen) which built and later rented higher-quality houses for the working class. Their plan to improve housing on the Zebrastraat centered on a building project designed and supervised by Charles Van Rysselberghe, the officially appointed \\"City Architect\\" of Ghent. Since accommodation in the city was very expensive, Van Rysselberghe decided to construct an apartment- styled building with three units on top of each other. This housing project is widely known as the first social housing apartment building in Belgium. The building never had an official name, but it was popularly called \\"The Circle\\" (De Cirk) because of its circular central square. A 4th story was added in the 1930s. By the 1990s, the Ghent Workers Housing Company had evolved into the Ghent Housing Association (Gentse Huisvestingsmaatschappij), but they had trouble maintaining the decaying building. In 2001, the barely inhabited ruins were put up for sale and sold to the Liedts-Meesen Foundation. Between 2002 and 2005, this new owner reconstructed the exterior of the buildings into its original state and design, while profoundly reshaping the interior. It was the beginning of \\"The Zebrastraat project\\". The goal of the new Zebrastraat project is to create an urban climate by combining and mixing art, business, and housing. People can rent short or long term apartments, companies can book meetings or events, and artists can display their performances. In 2012, the Zebrastraat project expanded with the building of \\"New Zebra\\", a brand new extension to the original building, housing several life-size public artworks of artists such as Ned Kahn and Nick Ervinck. Initiatives The projects of the Zebrastraat project concentrated on interactive and experiential digital art. The foundation has favored less well known forms of artistic expression, especially those that reflect technological changes. The first initiative was the exhibition Stippels en Pixels in early 2005, linking new digital art forms with the pointillism of Theo Van Rysselberghe, brother of the original Zebrastraat architect. The success of this exhibition led to follow-up in 2006 with Update, a bi-annual exhibition for interactive and digital art, and to the creation of the New Technological Art Award in 2008. The award is presented to the individual who displays Outstanding Work in the World of Digital Art, after the evaluation by an international jury. The project has also begun naming an \\"Artist of the Month,\\" which allows a promising young artist to present his or her work to a broad and diverse public audience in a non-commercial context. In 2010, a second Update exhibition was organized, in the form of Body Sound, in cooperation with the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The Update events always conclude with an exhibition by an established provincial artist. The Zebrastraat project also owns its own permanent art collection, with works by Nick Ervinck, Panamarenko, Thomas Huyghe and Honor√© d‚ÄôO, among others. In addition to artistic endeavors, the foundation is also engaged in projects promoting diversity and opposing fragmentation between people, such as Habbekrats, a service for disadvantaged young people and for transgressing initiatives.

It was the first institution in the country for \\"colored persons of unsound mind\\". Central State Hospital serves the Greater Richmond Region of Virginia, providing forensic psychiatry and civil admissions ranging from short-term treatment to long-term intensive treatment for the most seriously mentally ill. History=Overview Diversional occupation In 1848, slaves in Virginia could be admitted to private asylums if their owners paid for their treatment, but not all owners could afford it, and whites were always given priority admission. It was also believed that when blacks tried to flee captivity, they were suffering from a mental illness called drapetomania, which Samuel A. Cartwright stated to be a consequence of masters who \\"made themselves too familiar with slaves, treating them as equals\\". The Confederacy established a hospital for wounded soldiers at Howard's Grove in 1862. It was reassigned in 1870 to the treatment of \\"colored persons of unsound mind\\" and was the first to offer treatment exclusively to the black population of Virginia. Dorothea Dix visited the hospital in 1875, during her travels for mental health reform, and donated pictures and musical instruments. Building for chronically ill females In 1885, the patients from Howard's Grove were transferred to a newly built red-brick hospital trimmed with gray granite. It had a central four- storey administration building flanked on either side by a three-story wing containing six wards. This arrangement, which is known as the Kirkbride Plan, was a symbol of moral treatment. The East and West Buildings were built on either side of the main building in 1890 and 1892 to treat more severe cases. The Legislature of 1893 changed the title of state \\"asylums\\" to state \\"hospitals\\" and the lunatic asylum was renamed a state hospital. In 1896, a two-story brick pavilion was built and the hospital became one of the first to care specifically for people with epilepsy. Patients were classified and assigned to wards for the recent and acute, chronic, demented, sick, tubercular, epileptic, criminal and suicidal. The wards for the suicidal were the least furnished. Building for delinquent females Mayfield Cottage was built in 1750 and was the oldest brick residence in the county. The hospital purchased the farm land on which it was built, and used it as a storehouse for many years. In 1904, a one-and-a-half-story chapel was built as a multi- purpose space for religious services, dances, concerts, and graduation ceremonies for the hospital's nursing students. Its simple 80x50 foot Gothic Revival design was conceived by Dr. William Francis Drewry and constructed by G. B. Keeler & Son. Twenty-four fire hydrants were installed and a fire house was built. Drying machinery was purchased for the laundry and an internal telephone system was installed. Workshops were established for carpentry, shoe repair, broom- and mattress-making. These activities were used as occupational therapy. The building for chronic females was built in 1915 for 160 patients along with one for male patients. In 1925, hydrotherapy tubs were installed on the first floor to provide a new form of treatment. From the opening of the hospital until 1915, the supposed causes of psychosis in those admitted included abortion, desertion, emancipation, marriage, masturbation, and typhoid fever. Some of the foods grown on the farm were alfalfa, peanuts, wheat, radishes, pumpkins, okra, watermelon, turkey, and milk. Lodge in woods The building for delinquent and feeble-minded girls was built in 1929 with a 100-foot barred arcade leading to the central building. In 1930, the new medical building was built for 100 beds. More wings were added to it later. The first floor was used for surgery, examinations, dentistry, lectures, x-rays, laboratories, treatment, and drug therapy. The second and third floors were for bedridden patients, so that they were undisturbed by out-patient and ambulatory services downstairs. In 1938 a State Colony for people with epilepsy was established on the grounds of the state hospital and later admitted the mentally disabled. It was renamed a training school and hospital in 1954 and then a training center in 1971. In the 1950s the patient population reached 4,800 with the construction of a maximum security forensic building and geriatric unit. Overcrowding was an increasing problem: the East View ward had 300 patients in one large room, and patients in the criminals' building were sleeping on the floor. The hospital served only African Americans until the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. From 1967 it accepted all races and nationalities. In 1978 Mayfield Cottage was sold to the Caudle family, who moved the structure a mile away to save it from demolition and opened it as a bed-and-breakfast in 1986. Accusations=Sterilization Building for male psychopaths In 1980, around 1,700 patients were sterilized without their consent. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, four of the 7,205 people sterilized in the state of Virginia filed a class-action lawsuit requiring the state of Virginia to notify every patient sterilized between 1924 and 1973 and to pay for operations to reverse the procedure. In 2010 the Central State Hospital Chapel was registered on the National Register of Historic Places as a symbol of the state's unequal treatment of African Americans during the period of segregation. The chapel was de-listed in February 2017 after deferred maintenance resulted in structural failure causing the building to collapse.

Merrily We Go to Hell (1932) - \\"I, Jerry, Take Thee, Joan.\\", The New York Times, June 11, 1932, accessed October 12, 2010. Hall believed the film was wildly funny in stretches, and described the acting by the two leads as \\"excellent\\", but believed the scenes in which March played intoxicated went nowhere, and that the script was lacking. However, despite similar reviews, which often noted that it had been directed by a woman, the film was one of the more financially successful films that year.Mayne, p. 59 Jessie Burns of Script criticised the casting of Fredric March in the film, finding him to be unconvincing, though thought that Adrianne Allen showed her \\"star\\" quality in her portrayal of an otherwise \\"artificial\\" character.

On each round, the each player rolls a set of five colour-coded dice, which then determine how many items the player must take. The items vary in length from 1 to 5 units.

Each truck is 5√ó3 units in surface area and 1 to 4 units high, although part of the surface area might be filled up in advance. The players then do their best to stack their items in the remaining volume in the truck. Any space left vacant counts as penalty points, and any items left over count as double penalty points. The player with the fewest penalty points is awarded 10 points. When every player is finished, the players deduct their penalty points, and a new round begins.

Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, located in Columbia, South Carolina. It was originally constructed in 1936, under the supervision of architect Harold Tatum. The courthouse is named for J. Bratton Davis, a bankruptcy judge first appointed in 1978 who later became Chief Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of South Carolina, and he served in that capacity until 2000. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, having been added to the list on March 2, 1979. History In the summer of 1932, the Postmaster General and Secretary of the Treasury authorized $550,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for the construction of a new courthouse and office building in Columbia, South Carolina. This structure was intended to replace the older Federal Building which had been built in 1875 at 1737 Main Street. The mayor of Columbia began investigating the possible purchase by the city of the old Federal property. The city arranged to exchange the property it owned at the southeast corner of Laurel and Assembly Streets for the Federal Building on Main. The original Federal Building still stands on Main Street as the Columbia City Hall. The U.S. Courthouse was designed by Harold Tatum in 1935. Tatum was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and was one of the few university-trained architects in Columbia. Archibald Brown (possibly representing the Federal Government) was Construction Engineer and James Barnes of Springfield, Ohio was awarded the contract to construct the building. The building was constructed in 1936. Original electric work was done by Miller Electrical Company of Columbia and Jacksonville, Florida. The concrete work was done by Concrete Construction and Supply Company of Columbia. The original construction photos (which can be found in the building manager's office) were done by Sargeant Studios of Columbia. The building was dedicated on January 18, 1937 and originally housed the U.S. District Court, the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and the District Attorney's Office. Architectural description The building's primary significance lies in its architecture rather than its history. Of particular note is the use of poured monolithic concrete as a building material. The use of poured monolithic concrete is common for plain, linear types of buildings (such as warehouses), however it was (and is) unusual for a structure of complex style and detailing to be constructed in this manner. The building is of the Renaissance Revival style, and has a basement, first, second, and third stories, a partial fourth level on the east and west sides and a partial fifth story with mirador rising from the center of the building. The building is of concrete and masonry construction, with steel and wood roof framing. The exterior walls and trim are all concrete. The building features a rusticated base, rusticated quoins, smooth walls and trabeated fenestration accented with various types of pediments. The Federal Building derives much of its significance from the method of construction. The building was constructed of poured monolithic concrete. It was the first building to be constructed this way in South Carolina and one of the first in the country to utilize this method of construction. The front facade is divided into five bays. The central pavilion projects beyond the plane of the facade. It is detailed with six Ionic fluted pilasters which define five bays within the central pavilion. The pilasters support the unenriched entablature and a pediment. The central pavilion divides the front facade into two wings (east and west). The entrance is in the central portion of the building. It consists of three recessed arched openings defined by rusticated voussoirs. Each opening contains a decorative wood fan light. The original wood doors have been replaced with steel ones but the contemporary doors are reminiscent of the original. The concrete platform spans the width of the central pavilion of the building and supports two wrought iron lamposts. The rear facade repeats the pattern of the front. The center portion of the building contains a rectangular plan fourth level. Crowning the fourth level is a fifth octagonal level which formerly housed a weather station and an observatory tower (the mirador). The two side facades are divided into five bays with the central bays defined by engaged pilasters of the Tuscan order. The window heads are more pronounced than those at the front and rear. The fenestration varies at each level. At the first level the windows are eight over eight, double hung, set in a rusticated facade with radiating rusticated voussoirs. The second level openings are detailed with simple molded surrounds except at the central pavilion where the center opening has a broken scroll pediment while the flanking apertures have plain pediments. The center window openings of each end pavilion are detailed with segmented arched pediments and ancons. At the third level, the windows are eight over eight double hung except for the central pavilion where they are twelve over twelve. All the fenestration on the rear (south) facade repeats the pattern of the front except at the third level where the windows are blocked-in at the south side of the courtroom. The interior of the building has had some alteration since construction. Its most notable feature is the third floor courtroom which appears to be in almost original condition.

Gabby's brother-in-law Beef gets Gabby work as a mechanic at the Metropolitan Garage. The shop is a front to a stolen car ring. His brother-in-law Beef, who is otherwise honest, is aware of this. One day, Gabby is sent to pick up Silver, Jenkins's girl friend, whose car has broken down. Both Gabby and Silver start a relationship, after which Silver leaves Jenkins. During a getaway one of car thieves hits Gabby's nephew Buddy, who is in the street driving a toy car. The driver makes it to the garage, and Buddy receives treatment at a hospital. A witness points out the car to Gabby, and he understands it's the car that drove into the garage to be repainted. He investigates and discovers a piece of Buddy's little car in the wheel of the stolen car. When he confronts Beef, Beef gets drunk and confronts Jenkins and the head of the stolen car ring. They kill Beef, making his death look accidental. Photographer Bill Jones gives Gabby a photograph of Beef in the car before the accident, which shows Beef was already dead.

Early career Bisland was born on Fairfax Plantation, St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, on February 11, 1861. During the Civil War, the family fled the homestead prior to the Battle of Fort Bisland. Life was difficult when they returned, and when she was twelve the family moved to Natchez, Louisiana, site of her father's family home which he had inherited.Verdery, Katherine. Elizabeth Bisland Wetmore, in Library of Southern Literature, p.5767-72 (1910) She began her writing career as a teenager, sending poetry to the New Orleans Times Democrat using the pen name B.L.R. Dane.Bradshaw, Jim. Acadiana Diary: St. Mary journalist competed with Bly, The Daily Advertiser, April 2, 2006Bradshaw, Jim. Elizabeth Bisland raced Nellie Bly around world, The Daily Advertiser, August 3, 2008 Once her writing activity was revealed to her family and the paper's editor, she was paid for the work, and she soon went to New Orleans to work for the paper. Around 1887, Bisland moved to New York CityBright Women These: Sketches and Portraits of Some Daughters of the South, The Day, January 2, 1891 and got her first work from The Sun newspaper. By 1889 she was doing work for a number of publications, including the New York World. Among other outlets, she later become an editor at Cosmopolitan magazine and also contributed to the Atlantic Monthly and the North American Review. Journey around the world Elizabeth Bisland on a ship's deck during her around-the-world race against Nellie Bly. In November 1889, the New York World announced that it was sending its reporter Nellie Bly around the world, in a bid to beat Phileas Fogg's fictitious 80-day journey in Jules Verne's novel Around the World in Eighty Days. Catching wind of this publicity stunt, John Brisben Walker, who had just purchased the three-year-old and still- fledgling Cosmopolitan, decided to dispatch Bisland on her own journey.Roggenkamp, Karen S.H. Dignified Sensationalism: Elizabeth Bisland, Cosmopolitan, and Trips Around the World , presented at \\"Writing the Journey: A Conference on American, British, & Anglophone Writers and Writing\\" University of Pennsylvania, June 10‚Äì13, 1999 Six hours after being recruited, Bisland departed westward from New York. Meanwhile, Bly left on a steamer headed to Europe, both on the same day‚ÄîNovember 14, 1889. The journeys were keenly followed by the public, though Bly, sponsored by the more sensationalistic and popular New York World (which mainly ignored Bisland), appeared to get more attention than Bisland and the genteel Cosmopolitan, which only published monthly. Bly, racing against the 80-day benchmark, was unaware of her competition until she reached Hong Kong on December 24. There, an official of the Occidental & Oriental Steamship Company told her that she would be beaten, stating that Bisland had passed through three days prior.Bly, Nellie. Around the World in Seventy-Two Days, Ch. 12 (1890) Ultimately, however, Bly triumphed over Bisland. Critically, while in England, Bisland was told (and apparently believed) she had missed her intended ride, the swift German steamer Ems leaving from Southampton, even though her publisher had bribed the shipping company to delay its departure. It is unknown whether she was intentionally deceived.Abrams, Alan. Gold among the summer's dross, Toledo Blade, September 5, 1993 She was thus forced to catch the slow-going Bothnia on January 18, departing from Queenstown (Cobh), Ireland, ensuring that Bly would prevail.Round Went Nelly, Daily Argus News, January 25, 1890Arrival of Elizabeth Bisland: Although Beaten by Neille Bly She Succeeds in Lowering Phiness Fogg's Record, The Chicago Tribune, January 31, 1890ELIZABETH BISLAND AND NELLIE BLY: The Globe-Trotting Race Between the Two Rapidly Nearing Its End, The Chicago Tribune, January 18, 1890Woman Against Woman: \\"Nellie Bly\\" and Miss Bisland go racing around the world, Aurora Daily Express, November 27, 1889ALL AROUND THE WORLD.; MISS BISLAND NOW ON HER OCEAN VOYAGE TO NEW- YORK, The New York Times, January 19, 1890 Bly, meanwhile, raced across America on a specially chartered train to complete her journey and arrived at her final destination point in New Jersey on January 25, 1890, at 3:51 p.m., for a total travel time of 72 days, 6 hours and 11 minutes (precise time was kept, as the World advertised a contest to guess the exact moment she would arrive). Bisland's ship did not arrive in New York until January 30, so she completed her trip in 76 days, also ahead of Fogg's fictional record.Miss Bisland Arrives: Her Trip Around the World in 76 days, The New York Times, January 31, 1890 Bisland wrote a series of articles for the Cosmopolitan on her journey, subsequently published as a book, In Seven Stages: A Flying Trip Around The World (1891).Bandel, Betty.

(2007) () Later career and personal life Bisland's writing was of a more literary nature than her participation in the world race might indicate (and her writings were a clear contrast from the more swashbuckling style of Bly's writings on her trip). Indeed, her 1929 New York Times obituary failed to even mention the journey, and she focused her writing on more serious topics after the \\"race\\". In 1906, she published the well-received The Life and Letters of Lafcadio Hearn; she had first met Hearn when both were living in New Orleans in the 1880s. Bisland's final book, Three Wise Men of the East (1930), was published posthumously. (note: abstract) Bisland married lawyer Charles Whitman Wetmore in 1891, (stating that Wetmore graduated from Harvard in 1875; other records show he obtained an L.L.B. as well in 1877) though she continued to publish books under her maiden name. The couple constructed a noted summer residence called Applegarth (on Long Island's North Shore) in 1892. Bisland died of pneumonia near Charlottesville, Virginia on January 6, 1929, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, coincidentally in the same cemetery as Bly, who also died of pneumonia in 1922.

Bearing dark green, strikingly glossy leaves and creamy fragrant flowers, it is increasingly cultivated in Southern African gardens as an attractive and strong ornamental tree. It can attain a height of up to 6m. Distribution The Bladdernut has a wide distribution, occurring from Cape Town in the south, to as far north as Ethiopia. It naturally grows in Afro-montane forest and on rocky mountain slopes. Cultivation This decorative little tree is excellent for gardens, with its tidy shape, dark glossy leaves and small red fruits, which start developing from about August to November. If planted alone it makes a good \\"accent plant\\" (especially in small gardens). However, it also makes a very good hedge, as it has lush, dense foliage and responds particularly well to clipping. Lastly, it can be grown as a container plant (It is even used as a bonsai specimen). Diospyros can be grown in the sun as well as in the shade, although it grows taller and thinner in the shade. Once established, it is also relatively drought-resistant. It has sweetly scented flowers, and attracts birds to the garden. Diospyros is dioecious (separate male and female trees), but can easily be propagated from seed, which should first be scratched/scarified before planting. The seed typically germinates in several weeks, and the juvenile trees are relatively slow growing. Pictures File:Diospyros whyteana - small tree.JPGA small specimen, growing in Cape Town.

Plot summary The Hyperboreans have kidnapped Rann, the daughter of Njal, leader of a tribe of Aesir warriors. Soon, Njal leads his men on a raid to rescue her. The young Cimmerian, Conan, participates in their raid. Ominously, the thirty men sent ahead as scouts vanish, and, when the rest reach the enemy stronghold, they witness their comrades being tortured to death on the fortress walls. Conan infiltrates the castle and rescues Rann, while the Aesir travel back to Asgard, pursued by the Hyperboreans. Turning at bay, Njal's men realize that the reanimated corpses of their slain comrades are among those fighting against them. In the ensuing battle, Conan is captured by the enemy.

A provisional government took power after the liberation of the country from German forces on 28 November. Its interim Prime Minister was Secretary-General Enver Hoxha of the Communist Party of Albania. The interim government was to be in existence until the holding of elections and the convening of a Constituent Assembly. The government was led by the National Liberation Movement, which in turn was dominated by the Communist Party. From the outset, the Democratic Government was a Communist state. It sidelined the nationalist Balli Komb√´tar, a task made somewhat easier by its collaboration with the Nazis. King Zog I was effectively dethroned; the Democratic Government barred him from ever returning to the country. The LN√á quickly established fraternal relationships with other Communist countries. Elections were held on 2 December 1945. By this time, the LN√á had transformed itself into the Democratic Front of Albania, which was the only organization to contest the election.

The film's title was typical of the sensationalistic titles of many Pre-Code films.Doherty. pg 103 Adapted from the 1932 novel of the same name buy Jim Tully, the film was inspired in part by I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and was part of a series of films depicting men in chain gangs following the success of that film.Doherty. pg. 162 O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage and is sent to prison.Laughter in Hell, tcm.com, accessed October 12, 2010.Doherty. pg 167 The movie received a mixed review in The New York Times upon its release.Hall, Mordaunt. Laughter in Hell (1933) - A Chain-Gang Melodrama., The New York Times, January 2, 1933, accessed October 12, 2010. Although long considered lost, the film was recently preserved and was screened at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood, CA in October 2012. The dead man's brother ends up being the warden of the prison and subjects O'Brien's character to significant abuse. O'Brien and several other characters revolt, killing the warden and escaping from the prison. The film drew controversy for its lynching scene where several black men were hanged. Contrary to reports, only blacks were hung in this scene, though the actual executions occurred off-camera (we see instead reaction shots of the guards and other prisoners). The New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the scene for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some southern states. Plot O'Brien plays an Irish mine worker, Barney Slaney. Later Barney gets a job as a fireman on the local train for an engineer named Mileaway. He gets married, but finds his wife having an affair with Grover Perkins, a childhood nemesis. Barney loses control and kills them both. He turns himself in and receives a life sentence of hard labor. Barney quickly finds out that the brother of the man he killed, Ed Perkins, will be in charge of his chain gang, and the brother bullies him repeatedly. While the prisoners dig graves, Barney knocks Ed unconscious and drops him into one of the open graves. He then escapes during the ensuing mayhem, in which the warden is killed. He breaks out of the police dragnet, and hides at a farm which recently had a pestilence infection. He meets a woman named Lorraine, and they run away together.

The Motion Picture Herald expressed concern that the events depicted could be very difficult for some African Americans to watch. Writing in New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) Vere E. Johns praised the producers for depicting the scene and in so doing, publicizing the atrocities that were happening in some southern states. Johns also disagreed with the initial reports in the Herald which stated that only blacks were lynched, Johns stated (erroneously) that both blacks and whites were lynched in the picture. Although Universal Pictures released Laughter in Hell with the lynching scene intact, like many American films of the time the film was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. Several censorship boards including New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Chicago removed the lynching scene, allowing only indications that a hanging was about to take place. Reception Mordaunt Hall, writing for The New York Times praised the acting, the characterizations, action sequences, and some of the banter, but was not impressed with the storyline.

He then worked for approximately a year as a clerk for the board of insurance underwriters in California, before returning to UC Berkeley. However, his studies were interrupted this time by World War I. Houston was drafted by the U. S. Army, where he served as the regimental personnel adjutant with the 32nd Division‚Äîthe only African American to hold that position in the entire army. Upon his discharge, he once again returned to UC Berkeley to attend summer school, but left the following fall to become an agent with the National Life Insurance Company in Los Angeles. At National Life, Houston sold insurance to black waiters and cooks at the railroad commissary. In the early 1920s, when William Nickerson, Jr. arrived in Los Angeles to establish a branch of the Texas-based American Mutual Benefit Association, he needed someone with local contacts who had some knowledge of the insurance business. As a result, he hired Houston as his first employee. Houston served as superintendent of agents for the new branch. In 1923, feeling he could make more money at a locally based company than one based out of state, Houston informed Nickerson that he signed a contract with Liberty Building and Loan Association. Houston was replaced by George A. Beavers, Jr., a Georgia-born businessman who was one of the first salesmen hired at the branch. Louis M. Blodgett was the principal figure behind Liberty, who would later start Angelus Funeral Home in Los Angeles in 1925. Houston worked there as a field manager with the difficult task of selling bonds to economically strapped African Americans. He did not stay long with Liberty in the wake of an appealing business opportunity from his former employer. Golden State In 1925, when William Nickerson, Jr. decided to form Golden State Guarantee Fund Insurance Company in Los Angeles he convinced Houston to join him in the new venture. Nickerson asked Houston, who had previously worked with the insurance commission, to meet with them to determine the requirements to form an insurance company in California. They decided to establish the firm under Chapter 6 of the Insurance Code which required that five hundred life insurance policies be obtained and paid for in advance, and that a fund of $15,000 be deposited with the Department of Insurance. Houston, with his financial contacts, was given the responsibility to raise the $15,000 through the sale of fifty dollar certificates. Golden State was granted their license on July 23, 1925. At this time it was very difficult for the approximately 40,000 blacks in California to obtain insurance from white-owned companies at reasonable rates. Starting in a small, one-room office on 1435 South Central Avenue, the initial officers were Nickerson (president), Beavers (vice president) and Houston as secretary/treasurer. In less than three months, the company had already outgrown their cramped offices and moved to a large storeroom on 3512 Central Avenue. Under Nickerson's leadership, Golden State Mutual prospered. The following years were a period of rapid growth and expansion. By 1928, the company had grown to 100 employees and built a new headquarters at 4261 Central Avenue. That same year Golden State joined the National Negro Insurance Association. In 1931, the name was changed to Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. The firm opened its first office outside of California in 1938 when a branch was established in Chicago. Also in 1938, the officers asked the insurance commission to allow them to convert from assessment to legal reserve status. This required a $250,000 fund be deposited with the state, which was completed by 1941. In 1944, Golden State opened an office in Nickerson's home state of Texas. When Nickerson died in 1945, Houston assumed leadership of the company. At that time, Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company was the seventh largest black insurance firm in the United States and the largest black-owned business west of the Mississippi. With Houston at the helm, Golden State Mutual continued its growth and expansion. In 1946, they set up their Funeral Services Division. Three years later, the company opened a new building on the corner of Adams Boulevard and Western Avenue in Los Angeles that was designed by prominent architect Paul Williams. During the 1950s, Golden State expanded operations into Oregon, Washington and Arizona. They also installed electronic data processing systems and began offering mortgage insurance and group insurance. Houston served as president and chief executive officer of Golden State until January 1967, when he became chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Later years In 1970, Houston's two sons, Norman B. Houston and Ivan J. Houston took over active management of the company. The younger Norman, replaced his father as chairman of the executive committee. Ivan would replace the retiring Edgar J. Johnson as president. However, the elder Houston would still serve in various capacities at Golden State Mutual until his retirement in 1977, after which he was named honorary chairman and chairman emeritus. Other business activities Houston also continued to be involved in other business activities. In 1947, he was one of the organizers of Broadway Federal Savings and Loan (later Broadway Federal Bank and served as its chairman of the board for many years. He also was briefly involved in the organization of the National Bank of Los Angeles in 1949, which was the brainchild of H. A. Howard, manager of Broadway Federal. Community activities The first African American to be appointed to the California State Athletic Commission, Houston would later serve as chairman of the commission. Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty appointed him to the 1976 Olympic Games Committee. Houston was also chairman of the management committee of the 28th YMCA in Los Angeles. Death Houston died in Los Angeles on October 20, 1981 just four days after his 88th birthday. In addition to his sons, Houston was survived by his widow, Edythe and a daughter, Elizabeth Jean.

Despite its common name, Kiggelaria africana is not related to the more familiar fruit-producing peach tree (Prunus persica) although the leaves do look similar, if only very superficially. Unlike peach leaves, they are fairly thick and stiff, with a thin coating of fur on the undersides. Appearance A well-shaped, robust, evergreen tree with grey- green leaves. The smooth bark is pale grey in colour and the tree tends to be low-branching. The wild peach is dioecious (having separate male and female trees) and its tiny flowers are bell-shaped and a yellowish colour. The flowers are followed later in the summer by round, green capsules. These split open once ripe and the seeds, which are each covered in a layer of bright orange-red flesh, are eaten and spread by birds. Distribution This tree grows across southern and eastern Africa - from Cape Town in the south, northwards as far as Kenya. It occurs naturally in Afromontane forests as well as by the coast, in bushveld and along rivers. Growing Kiggelaria africana The wild peach is a very tough, hardy and fast-growing tree. It prefers a sunny position (but tolerates shade) and a moderate amount of water. It also survives frost. It naturally forms a large shade tree with a gentle, non- invasive root system, but also makes a good windbreak or hedge. If a conventional \\"tree shape\\" is required, then the shoots that grow from the tree's lower trunk should be removed. A multitude of birds enjoy the tiny red fruits and will consequently be attracted to this tree, as are Acraea horta butterflies. Their caterpillars sometimes eat the tree bare, but this is part of a natural process and the Kiggelaria trees always rapidly regrow their foliage. This tree can easily be propagated from seed. Young plants grow fast and begin flowering after only a year or two.

It first aired on BBC One on 11 August 2003. The episode was written by Howard Brenton, and directed by Sam Miller. In the episode, Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is being framed by thought-to- be-dead CIA agent Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana), as revenge for what happened to his daughter. After its original broadcast, the finale was seen by seven million people, a third of the television audience during its time slot. The episode, particularly due to its cliffhanger, received critical acclaim. Plot The episode begins in Miami, Florida, where three masked men break into the apartment of hitman Michael Karharias (Bruce Payne), who is under house arrest. The head of the group employs Karharias to kill an Englishman, but on the condition that he \\"do it dead\\". The leader then shoots Karharias to death. Later, in London, Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) and CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds) meet at a hotel, where Christine hands Tom a telex from the CIA office where they receive intelligence of Karharias (not knowing he is dead) travelling to London to assassinate a member of the British Cabinet. Because Christine has no clearance reading the file, and that the CIA does not intend to inform MI5 of the threat, Tom appoints a reluctant Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo) and Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) to run a secret operation to intercept the assassin without the knowledge of their superior Harry Pearce (Peter Firth). The trio try, and fail, to apprehend \\"Karharias\\" before the CIA does. Danny later decides to follow Tom as the latter is chasing a lead. There, Danny comes across a fake passport with Tom's picture on it, indicating that he is creating a legend without MI5's knowledge. Harry soon becomes aware of the trio's activities. Tom, meanwhile, follows CIA agent Herb Zeigler (Tomas Arana) to a dead drop, leading to a countryside farm house. The trio are captured. After Danny is beaten, the group take Zoe. In that time, Danny confronts Tom about the legend he is creating, but Tom insists he is not making one. Danny's suspicion is solidified when the masked men act as if Tom was on their side, by letting him go. They sedate Danny and Zoe and leave them to escape when they regain consciousness. They report back to Harry, where they all reluctantly agree that Tom is setting up the legend to escape the country after the assassination; Karharias was found dead in Miami, and there is no record to suggest the CIA even had intelligence of an assassination plot. As this transpires, Tom is tricked into handling a Gepard M1 sniper rifle in order to get his fingerprints on the weapon. Zeigler reveals himself to be Herman Joyce, a legendary CIA agent who has a grudge against Tom. It is revealed that Tom recruited Joyce's daughter Lisa to infiltrate an anarchist group. The mission went wrong and as a result, Lisa is in a mental hospital in Maine. Joyce has been planning to elaborately frame Tom for an assassination. Joyce and his team leave Tom, who runs to a nearby house to report to his team. By this time, he learns that Sir John Stone, the Chief of the Defence Staff, was killed, with a sniper rifle left with his fingerprints on it. Danny, Zoe and Harry arrive at the house to tell Tom that Joyce was killed in a car accident five years ago. No longer believing his innocence, Harry is going to call for back-up, forcing Tom to shoot Harry with a shotgun. Tom later disappears into the North Sea. Production Top Gear, Rupert Penry-Jones and Peter Firth joked that the latter's character was nearly killed off due to punishment for asking the BBC for a pay rise. Writer Howard Brenton found writing the end difficult because the producers knew Matthew Macfadyen would leave the series, but not whether he'd return in the beginning of the third series. He stated that the producers \\"didn't know whether Matthew was going to return to the series or not. We knew there'd be a third series, but we didn't know whether he'd be in it. So I said 'well, is he going to be in it, or isn't he'. And for some times it was, 'oh he's not going to be', so I kill him. And then he said he is gonna be in it, so I unkill him.\\" Because of this, Brenton wrote twelve drafts of the episode. In the end, he wrote a \\"big cliffhanger, in which he could be dead, could be gone forever, or what.\\" The character Herman Joyce was created by Brenton to become a worthy opponent to Tom. Joyce's creation was inspired from the \\"great criminal minds\\" such as Karla from John le Carr√© and Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes. Brenton thought the addition of Joyce would be a fitting end, so that if Tom was defeated, it would be by a master who would later be undone in some way with or without him. Brenton chose the name of an assassin, Mickey Karharias, because \\"Karharias\\" is Greek for Shark; the producers thought that Karharias was a \\"real villain name.\\" Having him killed in the beginning to set up the episode was influenced by The Man Who Never Was. The episode also included Zoe being untrusting towards Tom, because Brenton wanted her to be resentful towards his affair with Dale, and placing allegiance with her rather than his team. In an interview on Top Gear in June 2008, Rupert Penry-Jones and Peter Firth commented on the near-death experiences on the characters. Regarding Harry's shooting, Penry-Jones joked to Jeremy Clarkson, \\"Every time [Peter Firth] asks for more money or five day weeks, they start giving him scenes where he might die.\\" The love scene between Christine Dale and Tom Quinn were one of actress Megan Dodds' favourite to film because she was relaxed. There was a discussion beforehand on how much clothing each of the actors are comfortable with removing. The scenes set in Miami took place in Peckham. Also, one scene where a shop owner props up water from the shelter and almost missing Macfadyen was not in the script, and was shot by accident. However, it was decided the incident would be useful. Broadcast and reception \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" was initially broadcast on Monday, 11 August 2003 on BBC One. The finale was seen by a third of the television audience during its time slot, receiving overnight viewership of seven million. The episode beat Diamonds Are Forever on ITV1, which received 4.6 million viewers in the same time slot. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the finale received final ratings of 7.32 million viewers, making Spooks the sixth most seen broadcast on BBC One, and is the 16th most seen broadcast in total the week it aired. In the \\"Best of Drama\\" viewer polls at BBC Online, the cliffhanger was voted the second in the most \\"Favourite Moment\\" category. The scene was beaten only by the return of \\"Dirty Den\\" Watts in EastEnders. Whilst reviewing the seventh series, Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian's Organ Grinder blog named \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" his \\"favourite Spooks episode.\\" In review of the DVD boxset of the second series boxset, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak reacted very positively to the finale, noting that the drama and intensity of the second series builds until the last episode. Landmann stated, \\"the last thirty or so minutes had me on the edge of my bed, [...] and the last five minutes were so powerful they affected how I felt for the next couple of days; I kept thinking about [Tom Quinn] and the tragic events that happened to him.\\" Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema called the finale \\"chaotic\\", and that the chain of events leading to the ending was \\"extremely well set up.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Series 2, Episode 10 at bbc.co.uk * * Episode 10 at TV.com 2.10 Category:2003 British television episodes ","title":"Smoke and Mirrors (Spooks)"},{"id":"29164435","text":"Rhyacionia adana, the Adana tip moth, is a moth of the family Tortricidae.

The female lays her eggs between needles just above the sheath of the needle fascicle. Newly hatched larvae spin silken cases between two old needles just above the needle sheath. They then enter the needles and mine toward the tip. After new needle growth has started, larvae enter and mine developing shoots. Several larvae may inhabit a single shoot, moving toward the buds and causing shoot death. In mid-June to late July, mature larvae move down the main stem of the tree and pupate in cocoons cemented to the stem just below the soil surface. Shoot death becomes apparent after the insect has pupated.

It was established in the late 19th century as one of the first formal neighborhoods outside of the city center and initially catered to the wealthy of the Porfirio D√≠az era. These early residents built large mansions, many with French influence, and many still remain. Middle class residents moved in soon afterwards, and building and rebuilding over the 20th century has introduced a number of architectural styles. These buildings include some of the first works by Luis Barrag√°n and today 383 are classified as having historic value. In the 1940s and 1950s, the area was home to a number of important theatrical and movie theaters. Most of the movie theaters have since closed, but ten important stage theaters remain, and have performances seven days a week. The colonia is still home to the Jard√≠n del Arte Sunday art market, which has inspired other such market such as the one in the San √Ångel neighborhood in the south of the city. the colonia had been in decline with the abandonment of mansions as wealthier residents left. However, more recently the colonia has seen an upswing in development as young artists and galleries have moved into the area. Many artists have found Colonia San Rafael less expensive, accessible and more dynamic than trendy Colonia Condesa or Colonia Roma. Location The boundaries of the colonia are formed by the following streets: Sullivan and Parque Via on the south, Ribera de San Cosme to the north, Avenida Insurgentes on the east and Circuito Interior Melchor Ocampo on the west. The colonia covers 53 city blocks and 105.32 hectares with approximately 24,000 inhabitants. The colonia is considered highly susceptible to earthquake damage. All these streets join with the Ribera de San Cosme, a hectic corridor that forms the area's northern border. Architecture and landmarks Much of the development of the colonia occurred during the Porfirio D√≠az period (1870s to 1910), when a number of architectural styles were used and mixed. The earliest constructions consisted of elegant private homes of wealthy Mexico City residents. Most of the remaining homes of this type can be found on streets such as Sadi Carnot, Sarapio Rendon, and Rosas Moreno. Many of these are French style mansions, similar to those found in Colonia Roma . Subsequent development and redevelopment has added just about all of the remaining architectural influences of the 20th century. There are houses from the 1920s with geometric decorative features such as that on F. Pimental as well as Art Deco from the 1930s and 1940s on A. del Castillo Street and more modern styles from the 1950s. There are also modern apartment buildings, traditional businesses such as corner stores, Chinese-Mexican cafes, bars and cantinas. Some of the first works by Luis Barrag√°n were realized here. 383 of its buildings have been catalogued for their historic value. There are three churches in the colonia with the most important being the San Cosme Church, which was founded in 1575 by Juan de Zum√°rraga over the ruins of an earlier hermitage dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian. This hermitage was built on what is now the Ribera de San Cosme but then was the country road that connected Mexico City with then-independent city of Tacuba. The church's original purpose was evangelization of the natives of the area, and had a hospital for them. In 1669, the Franciscans converted the site into a charity collection center with the name of Santa Mar√≠a de la Consolaci√≥n. The first stone of the current church was placed three years later in 1672 with a monastery constructed next door. The work was completed in 1675. Later, it became a parish church, as the monks handed both the church and monastery to regular clergy in 1854. This hospital was secularized to a military hospital, but these facilities were soon moved to the old San Pedro and San Pablo College in 1861. The parish church as a large collection of religious and colonial era art and has a Churrigueresque altarpiece from the 18th century. It was declared a national monument in 1931. The Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe Church was built in 1952 in a modern design by architect Francisco J. Serrano. He also built the Teresay Encanto Cinemas on S. Rendon Street, but it was destroyed by an earthquake. Another church is located on San Rafael Street. It has a large radial window and balconies but no towers. The Jardin del Arte, or Art Garden, is a non- profit organization that sponsors the Sunday outdoor art market on Sullivan Street. The association has its own formal rules, such as the one prohibiting the sale of copies of other works. All works sold by participating artists must be originals. The weekly event and organization was founded in 1955, and has spurred other similar market such as the weekend art market in Plaza de El Carmen in the San √Ångel colonia. Currently, the association has as members about 700 painters who exhibit and sell their works. The market takes place on a small park located next to the Monumento a la Madre. Despite the market, the park has suffered serious deterioration over the past 20 years due to crime, nearby prostitution and the proliferation of non-art street vendors. While the homeless and other vendors clear out for the Sunday market, they dominate the park for the rest of the week. The result has been graffiti, garbage, dog waste and playgrounds in poor conditions. In fact, by Sunday, the smell can be strong enough that art vendors need to clean with detergent and pine cleaner before setting up. The Cuauht√©moc borough invested 5 million pesos for cleaning, repairs and the improvement of drainage and lighting, and the homeless were expelled from the park in 2005, but area residents complain that the problems have returned. The colonia is home to two cemeteries, which were built for foreigners. The English cemetery was built in 1824 for Protestants, who were not accepted into Catholic cemeteries. This cemetery was the first of its kind in the country, it was closed in 1926. In 1980, the rest of the remains here were exhumed in order to transform the area into the Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n Cultural Center, conserving the neo colonial chapel by Charles Hall built in 1909 called the Capilla Britannica. The exhumed remains were moved to the Nuevo Pante√≥n Ingl√©s. The area is the colonia's only true park space, with the open air theater housing concerts and art exhibits. Next to the English cemetery is the American cemetery, which contains the remains of U.S. soldiers who died during the invasion of Mexico City during the Mexican American War, especially from the Battle of Molino del Rey and the Battle of Chapultepec . Although it is also closed, each morning, there is a ceremony honoring the unknown soldier. This cemetery is also closed to new burials. Both cemeteries were reduced in size when the Consulado River was encased and the Circuito Interior built. The Universidad del Valle de M√©xico building was a mansion built in 1901 in French style and initially used as a family residence when the area was still the Los Arquitectos colonia. After this family moved out, it became the site of the Junta Central de Conciliacion y Arbitraje in the 1940s. In the 1960s, it began to be rented by the Instituto Harvard, today the Universiad del Valle de Mexico. While much of its interior and facade has suffered changes over the years, the building is considered in good condition. A site on Sullivan Street was most recently the home of the Foro Isabelino, but it hosted several artistic venues. In 1953, German artist Mathias Goeritz established here the experimental museum called ‚ÄúEl Eco,‚Äù which was designed as a space ‚Äúdedicated to emotional culture.) However, two years later the building was converted into a bar due to financial reasons. In the 1960s, it was reopened as the Centro Universitario de Teatro (CUT or University Center of Theatre). The building was demolished in 1967, and in its place, the Lope de Vega Hall, better known as the Foro Isabelino took over for the old CUT. In 1973, it became the site of a university student takeover, by non-theater students demanding space to realize their own productions. When the students succeeded in their demands, they founded two theatrical companies that performed here. The building has since been catalogued as a heritage site by INBA, but theatrical operations were closed down in 1997. Today, the building is abandoned. On Miguel E. Schultz Street is a building that was once a federal jail, which briefly held Fidel Castro and Che Cuevara in 1956 after the Mexican government found out they were preparing to militarily confront the Fulgencio Batista regime in Cuba from Mexican soil. This prison ceased operating sometime in the 1980s. Another abandoned landmark is the mansion located on the corner of Rosas Moreno and Antonio Caso, which used to be the Russian embassy. In the 1980s, it was abandoned then suffered a fire. Today it is a shell with much of its roof caved in. All that remains intact is the pink stone decorative features on its facade. Other important sites in the neighborhood include the Hilario Galguera gallery on Francisco Pimentel Street, the Hotel Plaza on Sullivan Street (built in 1945 by Mario Pani), the Museo Universitario de Ciencias y Arte (MUCA) on Circuito Interior and the Valle de Mexico Masonic Lodge, established in 1945 and currently has 5,000 members. Socioeconomics From its beginning, the colonia has been home to a mix of socioeconomic classes, with small businesses owned by the lower middle class located in grand buildings, which mostly now hold cultural or large business institutions. It is a mix of traditional and modern architecture as the area is in transition. It is a traditional neighborhood filled with mom- and-pop stores, workshops to repair anything from electronics to shoes, small eateries, many cantinas, shops that sell only fresh chicken, Chinese-Mexican cafes, and even men who come around to sharpen knives and collect scrap iron and newspapers. In a number of sections, its streets are filled with people during the day and neighbors can often be seen chatting on sidewalks and in local markets. The main festival of the year has been that of Saints Cosmas and Damian since the beginning of the neighborhood and is celebrated each year on 27 September. It is celebrated with music, fireworks and foods such as pozole, enchiladas with mole sauce, quesadillas with squash flowers and atole. Here rich and poor alike eat and enjoy the events in the same space. Many of the interiors of the old mansions have been remodeled into apartments that average about 90m2 in size with two bedrooms, conserving the original facade. Most, including many artists, who live here are attracted by the area's past charm, reasonable prices and do not want to live far from the city center. Until recently, the colonia was in decline after Line 2 of the Metro and the Circuito Interior arterial road were built in the 1960s and 1970s. This caused many of the colonia's wealthier residents to move out, leaving behind Porfirian era mansions that are either abandoned, invaded by squatters or converted into tenements, despite the fact that 383 buildings in the area have been catalogued as cultural heritage sites. In a number of areas, nearly all of the buildings have been converted for commercial use, leaving the streets empty and quiet at night. During the day, most of its streets are saturated with cars, especially Sullivan, and Sadi Carnot streets, as cars look for ways to get between the Circuito Interior and Insurgentes. The main problems for the colonia today are crime, traffic, prostitution and unregulated street vendors, with the most common crime being car theft, followed by prostitution and robbery. Recently, however, many artists and galleries have begun to move into the area, attracted by historic buildings and lower rents. While it was built as a residential area to those wanting to escape the city, today, some areas of the neighborhood have street vendors who set up shop on sidewalks and streets. These vendors mostly sell food, unlicensed CDs and DVDs, crafts and clothes. Street vendors are most heavily concentrated on the Ribera de San Cosme, especially between Insurgentes and Naranjo Streets. There is an estimated 2,200 street vendors in the colonia with about 500 of them on Ribera de San Cosme alone. They continue to proliferate, blocking sidewalks and even partially blocking roadways especially on Ribera de San Cosme, Serapio Rendon, Miguel E. Schutlz and Rosas Moreno. Another area where vendors congregate during the day is Sullivan Street. Manolo Fabregas Theatre Since the 1940s, the area has been known for its theatres, both live theatres and movie theaters. The area has been called the ‚ÄúBroadway of Mexico,‚Äù as it is home to ten major theaters with show comedic and dramatic plays seven days a week with a seating capacity of over 6,000 people. However, the stage theatre in this area is in decline. In 1999, the Aldama Theater on Rosas Moreno closed, which had operated for 13 years. It was considered one of the most important stage theaters in the city. It was particularly known for the production of Cinderella and others for children. The colonia was home to some of the most important movie theatres in the city in the 1940s and 1950s, when it was popular to spend Sunday afternoon at the matinee, watching movies featuring El Santo, Gast√≥n Santos and Pedro Infante as well as films from Hollywood. These theaters included Cosmos, Veronica, Tlacopan and Naur, all on or near the Ribera San Cosme. Others include Briseno, Roxi and Encanto. One distinctive theater was the Roble, on Paseo de la Reforma, which has marble statues of Greek gods and a theater curtain from Holland. However, almost all of these theaters have closed down or have been converted to other purposes. The most important of these closed movie houses is the Cine Opera, which had seating for almost 4,000 people. The Cine Encanto theater was built by Francisco Serrano and inaugurated in 1937 on Serapio Rend√≥n Street. During its time, it was the only movie house where one could see a film for only three pesos. Its lighting was such as to optimize viewing in the dark. The theater suffered significant damage in the 1957 earthquake, which caused it to be demolished some time later. Sullivan Street and Parque Via are known for prostitution as one of the oldest ‚Äútolerance zones‚Äù where police generally do not interfere. It is the best known of these zones, which also include the La Merced Market area and San Antonio Abad Street. At one point, it was estimated that 200 prostitutes could be found on the streets between 10pm and 5 am Monday to Saturday. In 2004, there were three houses of prostitution on Sullivan Street, but most ply their trade on the streets and in nearby cheap hotels. Prostitution began to move into this area in the 1980s and by the late 1990s, has grown so much that there was an attempt to regulate the activity. In 1997, groups representing the prostitutes and neighborhood residents signed an accord to try and regulate the activities and visibility of the prostitutes. Prostitutes were supposed to stay only on Sullivan Street and Parque Via between the hours of 8pm and 1am, not drink alcohol, carry identification cards and be moderate in the dress in exchange for police tolerance. However, the prostitutes here are well-established, even stating protests against laws they deem detrimental to their welfare. Despite the accord, prostitutes can be found, as far away as Puente de Alvarado and working from as early as 11 am to very early in the morning. A number of established businesses have claimed that the open prostitution hurts their business such as a VIPS restaurant that states that the number of patrons decreases significantly at night. Beginning in 2010 new businesses, art galleries and establishments moved into the area displacing sex workers. History In the pre-Hispanic period, much of this area was covered by Lake Texcoco . However, it also contained the causeway that connected Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) to the city of Tacuba on the lakeshore. It was this path Hern√°n Cort√©s used to escape on La Noche Triste By the 17th century, enough of the lake had dried that the area was covered by farms. It also was the terminus of one of the Mexico City's two main aqueducts, the Santa Fe, that brought in fresh potable water. In 1860, a parcel of land in this area‚Äîthen just outside the city limits‚Äî was subdivided into 60 plots to create the exclusive colonia of Los Arquitectos. Sadi Carno Street was the site of military stables around this same time. Some of the first non-farm elements that were constructed here were ‚Äútivolis‚Äù or recreation gardens with restaurants and other services to cater to those who wished to spend time outside the city. By the end of the 19th century, Mexico City was breaking out of its traditional boundaries westward over former haciendas and ranches. Country homes for the elite were being constructed, which eventually became permanent. To reach these homes and the tivoli gardens, mule-drawn trains were established along what is now Ribera de San Cosme. The first permanent city residents of the area were part of the upper classes that benefitted from the economic policies of Porfirio D√≠az. They were soon followed by shopkeepers and laborers. as well as middle class developed from the rise of industry in Mexico. In 1879, the arches of the Santa Fe Aqueduct, (constructed in 1779) were demolished as lead piping was installed to deliver potable water to many areas of Mexico City. Another major infrastructure project was the construction of the Estacion Colonia rail station, which serviced the newly constructed rail link between Mexico City and the north and west of the country. What is now the Circuito Interior road was the Consulado River and the La Veronica Road. This road has a Baroque fountain that provided potable water to the area but this was demolished in 1879 when lead piping was introduced. Most of the colonia is situated on the former ranch of San Rafael or El Ceboll√≥n. This ranch was sold to developers Enrique Tr√≥n, Le√≥n Signorel and Eduardo Garcia in 1890. These men worked to subdivided and develop the land into a residential neighborhood, which was legally established in 1891. The boundaries of the colonia also include blocks from the old Arquitectos colonia on the east side. It was the seventh developed city neighborhood, and one of the first established outside the historic center. It was one of the new ‚Äúmodern‚Äù colonias in the early 20th century, with a square layout that later colonias copied. Most of the street names were traditional to Mexico City such as Calzada de la Veronica, Ferrocarril de Toluca and Artes e Industria. Some of these were later changed to the names of important people of the early 20th century such as Gabino Barreda, Guillermo Prieto, Ignacio Altamirano, James Sullivan and Thomas Alva Edison. However, it lacked a number of features of the more upscale neighborhoods such as Colonia Condesa such as large parks and traffic medians and circles planted with trees. However, the area attracted a number of famous residents such as Conservative writer and philosopher Lucas Alam√°n, and Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta. The latter had a property that covered an entire city block and doubled as a zoo. Two of Benito Ju√°rez‚Äôs daughters also lived here, in the area where the Cine Opera was eventually built. Since its heyday at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, many of the large homes built here have been replaced, modified or abandoned with many lots subdivided. One reason that the colonia declined was the building of Line 2 of the Metro along Ribera de San Cosme Avenue, making this street a main corridor for the city. This bought in crowds of people, which then led to the construction of stores, hotels and nightclubs, which was often unregulated. This, in turn, caused many of the area's wealthier residents to move out. The Circuito Interior was constructed in 1973. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake did significant damage here, and buildings since then have fallen due to structural damage related to the quake. For the first decade of the 21st century, there have been efforts to conserve the heritage of the colonial, rescuing various historic buildings, and improving the image of the area with the construction of new theaters. However, many of the older buildings in the area have not been catalogued or studied. Transportation=Public transportation The area is served by the Mexico City Metro and Metrob√∫s.

Until the introduction of a logo in 1958, the corporation had relied on its coat of arms for official documentation and correspondence, although this crest rarely appeared onscreen. With the increased role of television for the BBC in the 1960s, particularly after the foundation of ITV, the corporation used its logo to increase viewer familiarity and to standardise their image and content. The logo has since been redesigned a number of times, most recently, in 1997 with the BBC blocks, a logo designed to work across media. From 1958, for this television network, there are five different logos. The first logo of network is used from 1958 to 1963, the second logo is used from 1963 to 1971, the third logo is used from 1971 to 1992, the fourth logo is used from 1988 to 1997, and the fifth and current logo is used from 1997.Hayden Walker, History of BBC corporate logos . TV ARK. Retrieved 20 November 2010. History=Before the logo Before the BBC introduced its logo itself, in the form of the slanted boxes, the BBC used a variety of different symbols with which to represent itself. In printed media and corporation correspondence, it used the BBC coat of arms, while on screen, it used a different logo type. Originally, it used a stylised BBC text on early equipment, not unlike the caption that accompanied the BBC1 COW globe. This logo was rarely seen on screen, with captions containing the words \\"BBC Television Service\\" along with matching clock. In 1932, when the original reception room of the BBC Broadcasting House in London opened, a logo was laid in mosaic on the floor. This logo was merely a stylized entwining of two capital B's, one facing either direction, linked by a C in the centre. This mosaic logo is still visible on the floor today, though the area no longer serves as the BBC's main reception room. 1950s The first 'Blocks' logo with italicised lettering, used between 1958 and 1963. In 1953, Abram Games was commissioned to design an on-air image. Nicknamed the 'bat's wings', it consisted of a rounded brass contraption with a tiny spinning globe in its centre, with large wing-like protrusions flanked by lightning bolts on either side. For BBC Scotland, the globe in the centre was replaced by a lion. The first incarnation of the BBC blocks logo appeared in 1958. It consisted of square boxes with slanted letters, not unlike the first slanted logo seen in the 1960s. 1960s The first slanted logo used between 1963 and 1971. In the 1960s, the main BBC logo consisted of slanted boxes with italicised bold lettering. This was introduced soon after the introduction of ITV in 1955. This type of logo would go on captions at the end of productions as well as on cameras and other equipment used by the BBC. They became important when popular BBC programmes and clips from the BBC archives were being sold to be aired on other networks and channels. It was in the early 1960s that the 'bat's wings' logo ceased to be used. It was superseded by the BBC TV logo within a circle, behind which would appear a map of Britain split into broadcast regions. This set the style for a succession of circular images. On 30 September 1963, the BBC's globe logo first appeared. This was a striped line broken in the middle by a globe, with BBC1 in block letters below it. When it appeared, the continuity announcer would say \\"This is BBC Television.\\" while the globe spun. 1964 saw the creation of BBC1 and BBC2 brands, with the distinctive horizontal stripes across the screen. In April 1964, BBC2 was launched. Its logo was similar to that of BBC1, featuring the distinctive horizontal stripe, but with a large 2 in the centre with the BBC blocks beneath. As part of the publicity campaign for the new channel, artist Desmond Marwood created images of a kangaroo, named Hullabaloo with a baby named Custard in its pouch, to represent the new station. In 1969, when BBC 1 began broadcasting in colour, it introduced the 'mirror globe' logo. This logo show a rotating blue globe superimposed over a flat globe, as on a map. Below the globes there is a line and the words BBC1 COLOUR. The word 'colour' was included to remind viewers still watching in black and white to purchase a colour TV set. 1970s The rounded off and slanted logo that was used between 1971 and 1991. In 1971, a new softer logo was made, rounding off the boxes and making the spaces between the boxes larger. This logo was used on BBC merchandise, as well as the BBC1 idents and the BBC2 clock. More now than ever, merchandise was being branded with the logo, as more productions were being sold via the BBC's American identity, Lionheart Television. Also, records and videos were now starting to be produced and a corporate identity was getting more and more essential to ensuring that the audience knew it was authentic and that the quality programmes they were watching could be attributed to the BBC. The mirror globe began using a more ornate font in 1972. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the BBC1 channel logo used several different fonts, but with each change the logo remained blue. At this time, BBC logos were mechanical models filmed by black-and-white cameras. Colour was added afterwards, electronically, rendering it simple to change the colour as needed. In 1967, BBC2 introduced a logo featuring a blue 2 with a dot in the curve of the 2 and the word COLOUR underneath. In 1979, BBC2 debuted the first-ever computer-generated logo, a 2 flanked by a double line on the side. The symbols appeared on a black background, then disappeared. This logo remained in use until 1991. 1980s The underlined and final slanted logo that was used between 1988 and 1997. In May 1988, the BBC produced yet another new logo. Since the last one was made, a consumer brand was becoming part of nearly every TV station and corporation at the time (and, at ITV, had been so for many years). The BBC needed a strong and unified identity, and a change of said identity was key. Michael Peters was hired to design this all-inclusive BBC identity for the corporation. They modified the then-current logo by sharpening up the parallelogram edges again and set them to an angle of 17 degrees without reducing the size of the spaces between the boxes. They also sharpened up the text to make it match the clarity of the logo itself. The typeface used was Helvetica Neue. Also, under-logo lines were added to the logo for the first time. These lines were coloured blue, red, green to reflect the flags of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland respectively (an \\"English- bias\\" has always been a criticism of the BBC), as well as the three phosphors of colour television. These appeared on the BBC national-region identities from the identities's debut in 1988 and its gradual television debut over the period 1989, 1990 and 1991. Previously, in 1986, the electronically generated BBC2 logo was updated. The number 2 was replaced with the word TWO. The letters were white, 3D letters on a white background with red striping on the T as well as green and blue striping on the W. The word TWO appeared and faded on the white background. The rebrands of both BBC1 and BBC2 in February 1991 were also based on the then-current BBC corporate identity, when these two channels were given a total corporate look, unlike previous ways of branding the channels. BBC Radio Clwyd continued to use this logo until the station was closed in around August 1998 and the logo continued as an in-credit logo. 1990s The current and straight BBC logo since 1997. In the mid-1990s, when employed to rebrand BBC1, Martin Lambie-Nairn suggested that he look into the current logo choice and see what he could do, given that, the BBC at the time was also looking into the BBC brand as a whole. What he noticed, was that the BBC had a system that meant that every service or department had a different logo scheme. It had a BBC logo and the name with character. Lambie- Nairn decided to address this when he took on the project, as with all these logos, the core brand itself was severely weakened. It was also appropriate to look at the way the BBC was branded, as the BBC was about to take off in digital television and the internet, among other different ventures. After seeing a number of problems with the then-current logo, he decided that a new logo was necessary. The logo was technically unsuitable on-screen. When shrunk, it lost the lines underneath and the counters (the sections in the Bs) and also, when in colour on a colour photo, it again disappeared or parts vanished. Also, on a TV or computer, diagonals are difficult to work with as the logos pixelate, and anti-aliasing is required to make the logo work. The previous logo also followed the idea of the slanted boxes, and related the BBC back to the very first logo in the 1950s and 1960s, which was not what the corporation wanted at that time. Technically, the logo never looked comfortable next to the brand and straight letters. Finally, it was expensive to print as stationery would always have four-colour letterheads, and alongside other BBC brands could mean anything up to ten-colour letterheads and stationery. Lambie-Nairn's solution is the BBC logo that has been used on- screen since 4 October 1997. By straightening up the boxes and letters, it removed all the problems associated with diagonals and those associated with disappearing lines. This kept the boxes' shape, so that it would still be familiar with what people know about the BBC. The typeface used is Gill Sans, made by Eric Gill. It was chosen because, it was elegant, robust and has a timeless appeal: the typeface had been created 60 years before and so avoided the typeface looking outdated at a later date. This typeface also eliminated the disappearing counters issue, as the counters of the Bs were much larger. Appropriately, some of Gill's statues adorn the exterior of Broadcasting House. The logo was also designed so that anything could be added after the BBC logo, be it department, corporate, brand, TV, radio, etc. Also, by using this system, everything looked like it came from the same organisation, and it was also easy to add new logos. This system also only used black and white letterheads, meaning a big cost saving to the BBC and the licence fee payer. The only visible issue with the system, was that the logo for the BBC television and radio brands did not reflect their genre or appeal to the tastes of their target audiences. Lambie-Nairn proposed to show this as personality in the idents themselves, and evidence of this can be seen in the idents for BBC One made just after the logo was introduced. The BBC One balloons were made using the new logo, with the personality device in the balloons. The BBC Two idents, the 2s remained the same but with the new logo added underneath. 2000s and 2010s In 2002, the BBC One balloon idents were discontinued, as was the globe. The BBC Two idents that were in use since 1991 had been discontinued shortly before. BBC One's idents were replaced with 'Rhythm & Movement', with dancers from different cultures dancing to various musical styles, with BBC Two replacing their idents with the 'Personality' idents; the same '2' number, in a yellow background and given a 'personality'. In 2006, BBC One Channel Controller Peter Fincham introduced a new series of diverse channel idents, the 'Circle' idents as they became known, involved circles being formed by nature or people and their actions. These lasted for a little over a decade. BBC Two introduced 'Window on the World' idents the following year, which lasted until late 2014 when they were replaced with the revived 1991 set. In 2017, the BBC One Circle idents were replaced by idents under the theme of \\"Oneness\\", including a dance class and a group of swimmers. These idents have been criticised for lacking in creativity. In 2018, the revived 1991 set of the BBC Two idents were replaced by the 'Curve' idents. The current central logo of the BBC is still the BBC Blocks. It is the longest-used logo by the BBC, and as of 25 July 2020, it has been in use for 23 years.

The Doorway to Hell, The New York Times, accessed October 12, 2010. The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993:The Doorway to Hell The film was based on the story A Handful of Clouds, written by Rowland Brown. The film's title was typical of the sensationalistic titles of many Pre-Code films.Doherty. pg 103 It was marketed with the tagline \\"The picture Gangland defied Hollywood to make!\\"Doherty. pg. 154 Plot Louie Lamarr, the ‚ÄúNapoleon of the Underworld‚Äù according to the Chicago newspapers, is a young gang leader who is so successful and ruthless that he becomes the underworld boss of the entire city. He organizes all the gangs in a classic protection racket: They pay him a cut, and he enforces territorial boundaries, makes good on losses, and when someone breaks the rules he punishes them with deadly force. The result is peace on the city streets and huge profits all around. Just about everyone is satisfied except for Rocco who wants the kingpin slot for himself, and Pat O‚ÄôGrady an honest police officer who has known Louie since he was an orphaned street kid. Louie has a young brother, Jackie who goes to a fine military boarding school in a different city. Jackie remembers being destitute and hungry. He is proud of his successful brother but knows nothing of Louie‚Äôs business. Louie meets Doris and immediately falls in love. However, Doris is a gold-digger who is secretly in love with Louie‚Äôs best friend, Mileaway. Louie wants to get out of the rackets while the getting is good. With just one surprise last meeting to say good bye to his associates‚Äîand warn them not to try to find out where he is going Louie and Doris marry and head to Florida, stopping on the way to visit Jackie. They have dinner with the school, sitting at the head of the table with the Major. Louie observes that one of those boys might be as great as Napoleon, and that he has great hopes for Jackie. The Major replies that they are more interested in making them good citizens. When Louie says that war is a grand racket , a big business, the Major says that it is big, but it is ‚Äúcruel and profitless,‚Äù which gives Louie pause. Meanwhile, without the force of Louie‚Äôs dark charisma, and money, behind it, the organization is falling to pieces. Mileaway explains to some of the gangsters that he has besieged Louie with letters and telegrams but he refuses to return: He doesn‚Äôt want Doris or his kid brother mixed up in the rackets. Mileaway does not realize what he has done by revealing Jackie‚Äôs existence. A violent gang war erupts. In Florida, Louie goes off to play golf‚Äîdropping to the ground when a truck‚Äôs tire blows out and then laughing at himself. Mileaway phones, and Doris tells him Louie has become ‚Äúan awful dud.‚Äù He spends five hours a day writing his memoirs. Louie returns to retrieve a forgotten club, and Doris hands the phone to him. He ends by losing his temper with Mileaway and when Doris tells him his friend is right he asks her if she is ‚Äúone of them.‚Äù Has she got so much hoodlum in her that it won‚Äôt come out? In order to force Louie to come back, some of the gangsters try to kidnap Jackie outside an ice cream parlor by telling him that his brother sent them. Jackie is too smart to get in the car. He runs away down the street and is accidentally hit by a truck. The three young cadets who were with Jackie identify the men in the car for O‚ÄôGrady. In Florida, Louie proudly finishes his book; he expects a call from a publisher. The last line is ‚ÄúSo this concludes the life of a gangster and begins the life of a man. Finis.‚Äù A telegram arrives from Mileaway telling Louie to come at once because Jackie has been hurt. The phone rings; the man from the publishing company wants to read the book. Stone-faced, Louie says to Doris ‚ÄúTell him it‚Äôs not done yet.‚Äù In the next scene, Louie goes to a famous plastic surgeon, shows him a snapshot of Jackie and asks if he can fix his brother‚Äôs face. The doctor replies that he would have to see the patient. Louie tells him he is at Morse Brothers Undertaking Parlor. Jackie is buried‚Äîapparently on the school grounds‚Äîwith military honors. His best friend stands by Louie. Swearing revenge on the two men who killed his brother‚ÄîGimpy and Midget, so-called because of his big pot belly‚Äî Louie returns to the city. His plans are threatened by Rocco and by O‚ÄôGrady, who is building a case against the murderers. Louie and Mileaway kill Gimpy and dump his body in front of O‚ÄôGrady‚Äôs stakeout. O‚ÄôGrady comes to warn Louie not to leave town, and they share a drink. Louie admits that money doesn‚Äôt always mean happiness, but on the other hand, he never would have met Doris in the first place if he hadn‚Äôt been rich, and she is the happiest girl in the world. O‚ÄôGrady says nothing as he catches a glimpse in a mirror of Mileaway and Doris holding hands. Louie sends Mileaway and Doris off for the evening so he can deal with the Midget himself. ‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúI could think of a thousand places if you weren‚Äôt married to Louie.‚Äù She takes off her ring and tucks it into Mileaway‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúNow where do you want to go?‚Äù He turns his head toward her, leans down for a kiss and‚Äîfade out. Louie waits for Midget in a dry- cleaners, shades drawn. Midget, who thinks he is getting a payoff, tells his two bodyguards to wait on the street. He goes inside and at a signal from a man watching, a half-dozen drivers jump into their trucks and warm up their engines, revving the motors so they backfire repeatedly. The bodyguards flee. Louie washes his hands at a filthy sink. Three trucks pull away. At 3 am, Mileaway and Doris come to the apartment to find O‚ÄôGrady, who has been waiting there for two hours to arrest Mileaway for killing the Midget. Louie is already in jail. The cops give Mileaway the third degree but he doesn‚Äôt flinch until O‚ÄôGrady mentions ‚Äúthe house in Charleston Street‚Äù (where he and Doris were together). Mileaway signs the confession O‚ÄôGrady has ready. For killing the Midget in self-defense, he will get 5 years and then be able to enjoy his money. On the way to his cell, he stops at Louie‚Äôs cell and tells Louie he will be free soon. Grady tells Mileaway that Louie is being held for Gimpy‚Äôs murder. His confession has not helped his friend. Louie thanks Mileaway for the try and says to O‚ÄôGrady, What a friend! O‚ÄôGrady remains silent. Louie reads an ad in the personals column alerting him to a breakout. He pretends to be sick, knocks out the guard escorting him to the hospital and escapes. He hides out in a dingy room decorated with pictures of his hero, Napoleon‚ÄîOne is titled Napoleon in Exile. He hears a newsboy in the street and calls him up to the apartment. The paper is full of the gang war. He asks the kid to get him some groceries, and when he returns the innocent youth tells him that he met a friend of his, O‚ÄôGrady, who also knows Louie. Louie sends the boy on his way and soon O‚ÄôGrady comes to the door. He is unarmed. He has bad news for Louie: His prison break was engineered by his enemies. Two mobs are outside waiting to blast him. He was safe in jail. O‚ÄôGrady won‚Äôt arrest him now because they don‚Äôt have enough evidence to convict him. But he is a menace to society, and must be dealt with. Louie is sure that Mileaway will take care of Doris when he gets out. O‚ÄôGrady does not disillusion him about them. He leaves, telling Louie he ‚Äòll see him in 30 or 40 years. A waiter arrives from a restaurant around the corner with a last supper from the boys: a steak dinner, complete with a cigar, already lit. Laughing, Louie tosses his gun on the table, adjusts his tie and fedora in the mirror and puts the cigar in his mouth at a jaunty angle. He pauses for a moment in the open doorway, looking at a picture of Napoleon, then closes the door. There is silence and then the last paragraphs of the story appear: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòDoorway to Hell‚Äô is a one-way door. There is no retribution‚Äîno plea for further clemency. The little boy walked through it with his head up and a smile on his lips.

He also temporarily ruled the province of Louisiana in 1803.  Biography = Early Years  Juan Bautista Elgu√©zabal was born in 1741,Pares, Ross (1976). The Governors of Texas. Page 43. though the place of his birth is unknown. In 1795, he was appointed assistant inspector of a Presidio in the Mexican state of Coahuila. A year later in 1796, he was appointed assistant to the Governor of Texas, Manuel Mu√±oz, who had fallen ill and was waiting for approval of his retirement from the king of Spain. Elgu√©zabal became acting governor in August 1797. At this time, he made a detailed inspection into La Bah√≠a (\\"The Bay\\"), a region generally corresponding to the Texas coast on the Gulf of Mexico.  Government of Texas  In July 27, 1799, Elgu√©zabal assumed the position of Governor of Texas in the absence of originally appointed governor Jos√© Irigoyen, who had failed to accept the position. In 1803, Elgu√©zabal was also appointed acting governor of Louisiana, after this territory was sold to the United States. Many citizens of Louisiana sent Elgu√©zabal petitions requesting permission to settle in Texas, partially causing an influx of immigration to the province. Runaway slaves also contributed to this population increase, as Spain declared that any slave who crossed the Sabine River into Texas would automatically be freed. Most of these escaped slaves joined American Indian tribes, but some settled in the East Texas forests. However, it is not to be assumed that slavery was completely banned from the province; for example, certain French and Spanish slaveholders who moved to Texas were permitted to retain their slaves. Elgu√©zabal developed a more liberal policy than the province had held up to that time, improving the living conditions of its inhabitants (previously, the province had a high poverty rate that affected most of its population). He granted the Alabama-Coushatta and Choctaw Native American tribes permission to settle east of the Trinity River, under the autonomy that those tribes had acquired during the tenure of Manuel Mu√±oz, . = Relations with US = The Spanish Commandant General of the Interior Provinces, Nemesio Salcedo, who served under Elgu√©zabal, sent him a letter requesting that Elgu√©zabal order his officials to establish good relations with United States, but to refrain from communication with American officials. Concerned about the threat that the Americans posed to the relatively weak local Spanish forces, Salcedo ordered Ugarte, Commandant of the District of Natchitoches, to inform him about the number of US troops stationed in the district, the existence of militias or regulars in these troops, and the caliber of twenty artillery pieces that the US troops had in the city.JE Townes (2008). Invisible Lines: The Life and Death of a Borderland. Page 125. In August 1800, Pedro de Nava ordered Elgu√©zabal to secretly imprison horse- trader and freebooter Philip Nolan, who was suspected of being an American spy. Commandant Jos√© Vidal (in his charge as Commandant of Concordia, near Natchez), further indicated to Elgu√©zabal that Nolan was leading an armed group of thirty or forty men. However, Vidal was unsuccessful in his attempt to convince the Supreme Court of Mississippi to deny Nolan a passport to Texas.Edward Everett Hale, Hsuan L. Hsu, Susan Kalter (2010). Two Texts by Edward Everett Hale: \\"The Man Without a Country\\" and Philip Nolan¬¥s friends. Page 50. Lexington Books. = First schools in Texas and the end of his term = Between 1803 and 1804, Salcedo wrote another letter to Elgu√©zabal asking to build primary education schools and send teachers to instruct the \\"people of the frontier\\" in basic literacy (reading and writing). Elgu√©zabal ordered the construction of several schools (the first of Texas's schools were established during the Elgu√©zabal's administration) and sent teachers to the province. The teachers monthly obtained one-fourth of a peso for every boy who was enrolled in school (as girls were not permitted to enroll). Schools were established in San Antonio (then capital of the province of Texas) and the presidio of La Bahia del Espiritu Santo by 1804. No schools were built in Nacogdoches until 1805, as the population was very dispersed and the most young boys were employed as ranch hands. It was during this time that Jose Francisco Ruiz became in first schoolmaster in San Antonio.Jones, Oakah L. (September 15, 1996).

He died in office on October 5,1805 in San Antonio.

He was a leading designer of commercial buildings in the City of London. Life Born in St. Laurence Pountney Hill in the City of London, he was the eldest son of the surveyor and architect Edward P. I'Anson (1775‚Äì1853). He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School and at the College of Henri IV in France, and articled to his father at an early age. Subsequently, he entered the office of John Wallen, principal quantity surveyor at that time in the City. At the close of his indentures I'Anson travelled for two years, extending his tour as far as Constantinople. On his return in 1837 he entered into practice, both as assistant to his father and as an independent architect. In 1823, the I'Anson family bought 9, St Laurence Pountney Lane, the house neighbouring their own.No. 9, which still exists, has since been renumbered No.7A Laurence Pountney Hill. See Holder and Phillpotts, 2011. The firm of Edward I'Anson and Sons operated from there from 1850. I'Anson made various changes to the property, including a new roof, and some Venetian-inspired windows. He also acquired the adjoining disused churchyard for use as a garden. In 1861, I'Anson and his wife, Catherine Blakeway, purchased land at Grayshott in Surrey, a village then part of Headley. The family provided a site for the National School established there in 1871, and maintained a close connection to the area. I'Anson's son Edward Blakeway made funds available for the construction of the church, and many of his family are buried and memorialised in its churchyard. Works His first important building in the City was the Royal Exchange Buildings, designed for Sir Francis Graham Moon in 1837. There he made use of concrete for the internal works, an early example of this modern construction method that had previously only been used in experimental or minor projects. This brought him into repute, and obtained for him the chief practice as architect in the City. I'Anson developed a career as a pioneering designer of purpose-built commercial buildings in the City. Those executed by him in the Italian style, such as the buildings of the British and Foreign Bible Society at 146 Queen Victoria Street (1866‚Äì8) were the most successful. His designs in the Neo- Gothic style included the school of the Merchant Taylors' Company at the Charterhouse. I'Anson was surveyor to the Merchant Taylors for many years, and also to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for which he designed a new museum and library. He was responsible for the remodelling of Fetcham Park, Leatherhead, and the restorations of the Dutch Church in Austin Friars and of St. Mary Abchurch. I'Anson was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1840, and was chosen president in 1886. He contributed numerous papers to the Transactions of the institute. He was also a fellow of the Geological Society, and in 1886 became president of the Surveyors' Institution. He was a frequent traveller on the continent, and in 1867 visited Russia. In many of his numerous duties as surveyor, and in some of his architectural works, notably the new Corn Exchange in Mark Lane, he was assisted by his eldest son, Edward Blakeway I'Anson. Death I'Anson died unexpectedly on 30 January 1888, and was buried at All Saints church in Headley, East Hampshire. A portrait of him will be found in the Builder, xxix. 1006. Edward Blakeway I'Anson continued the practice at St Lawrence Pountney Hill.

Marvin Jones Federal Building. It reflects Art Deco architecture and Moderne architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. In addition to its continuous use as a courthouse, it has served as a post office, as a customhouse, and as a government office building.

Significance Built in 1937 and 1938, the building occupies a prominent position in downtown Amarillo, across East Fifth Avenue north of Courthouse Square.General Services Administration page on the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Smaller and less important architecturally than the adjacent Potter County Courthouse, the Jones Building nevertheless gives the Federal Government a tangible presence in the center this city on the plains of North Texas, and demonstrates the concern that existed at the time of its construction for enhancing public places. Built to occupy approximately half of the block bounded by East Fifth Avenue, S. Taylor Street, East Fourth Avenue and S. Fillmore Street, the structure was designed as the United States Post Office and Courthouse. It served both of these functions, and provided additional Federal offices, until 1977 when the Post Office moved its central office out of the building and into its fourth Amarillo location. This building was designed by well-known Texas architect Wyatt C. Hedrick (who had offices in Fort Worth, Dallas, and Houston). Louis A. Simon of the U.S. Treasury Department was the supervising architect and Neal Melnick was the supervising engineer; Algernon Blair of Montgomery, Alabama was the contractor. Julius Woeltz of New Orleans won an important competition to paint the murals on the walls of the Main Lobby. Although not a particularly distinguished design effort by the Hedrick firm, the completed building was nonetheless well-planned and demonstrated of a thorough familiarity of the Federal Government's standard details of the day for post offices and courthouses. Further, the Jones Building can be understood as an example of what is characterized as the American Renaissance Movement, a relatively short-lived period in art and architecture. This strongly nationalistic movement began by identifying with the public art and construction programs of Renaissance Italy, and then adapted European art and architectural styles and symbolism to celebrate American themes. It ceased without finding a distinctive path. After about fifteen years of occupancy, in the mid-1950s the Government extended the mail platform on the north and back side of the building to the west. Other alterations were also effected in the ensuing years, including the provision of paving in place of green space on the east and west sides of the building. In the 1970s, insensitively conceived and executed alterations for air conditioning and renovations to replace the Post Office damaged and obscured large portions of the interior. With plans for two additional courtrooms the historic significance of the Jones Building is limited to its largely intact exterior, a small Main Lobby, the District Courtroom and certain service areas and elements. Architectural description The J. Marvin Jones Federal Building is a three-story concrete structure with a full basement, notable for the straightforwardness and simplicity of its planning and expression. Rectangular in plan, regular and symmetrical in elevation, it combines an organization derived from Classical or Renaissance Revival architecture with details drawn from the Modernistic style of its date of creation. The thirteen bay principal elevation faces Courthouse Square with regularly spaced windows cut into the plane of the light buff limestone clad wall. With a limestone spandrel at the level of the second floor itself, these set-back windows give a rhythm to the primary wall surface that allows it to read like pilasters marching along the facades. Two entries, symmetrically placed in the slightly wider second and twelfth bays, are identified with fluted pilasters that flank the doors and extend vertically approximately forty feet to the head of the third floor windows. On the south-facing elevation as well as the east and west facades the second and third floor windows are combined into a single unit with a glass spandrel window over the intermediate floor structure. Pilasters with simplified capitals rise alongside each jamb from the second story window sills to the heads of the third floor windows. This expression produces the appearance of a two-story building with a principal, upper floor of grander purpose, that of the double-height District Courtroom. The depth and substance of the mottled pink and black Texas granite base and basement wall cladding are obscured by gratings installed in recent years at grade, that block off the recessed areas or light wells around the building. The safety concerns that led to the introduction of these gratings can be relatively simply addressed with minor modifications of the handsome wrought iron railings that surround the building. Security bars can be reintroduced at the basement windows if required. Granite cheek blocks and planters either side of the two sets of steps to the East Fifth Avenue entry doors are carved with reeds and flutes characteristic of the Moderne style of architecture. A wheelchair ramp added in 1992 at the entry to the Main Lobby employs the same Texas granite as the original construction, with less skill in detailing and arrangement. The rear or North side of the building is distinguished from the other sides by its form, its wall material and the former mail platform, extended to the west in 1956. The rectangular footprint of the basement and the first floor is developed into a U-shaped plan with a light court at the rear on the second and third floors. A matte, light cream colored face brick clearly distinguishes this as a secondary or service side. The original purpose of the building, the clarity of its conception, the period of the construction and the skill of the architect are all evident here. Still intact on all facades are the original steel window frames and sashes, of standard manufacture and characteristic of the period of construction. There are however multiple broken lights or glasses in the first floor transom windows. This is the result of back-painting the glass black and installing insulated plywood backup panels, which occurred in the 1976 renovation as a byproduct of lowering ceilings for air conditioning ductwork. This unfortunate renovation also closed the north-facing skylight monitor over the first floor area that once housed the postal work area. The original aluminum and glass entrance doors have also been removed, with their pulls and hardware designed to reinforce the motif stated by the wrought iron railing around the building, and replaced with generic aluminum framed doors. The single light glass transom above these doors has been replaced with an opaque board that serves as a backdrop for the building name. The aluminum eagles survive, perched on their lighting fixture supports at the second floor window sills above each entry, although the custom fixtures are no longer functioning. Over time the building has been surrounded by asphalt parking areas on all sides except the south side, which faces Courthouse Square. As conceived and planted, the building was set with green space on three sides to reinforce the limestone clad principal elevations, with service and vehicular access only on the north side. At present the paving for parking and drives is loosely organized and deteriorated. Although vehicular parking is always valuable, a restoration of the original relationship of the building to the landscape is recommended. Service functions in the paved areas at the rear of the building also need to be analyzed, to avoid potentially dangerous conditions like that presented by the close proximity of the dumpster to the gas meter. On the interior of the Jones Building, there are few spaces still relatively intact. The Main Lobby and the District Courtroom are most notable in this regard; both have elements that are unaltered or largely restorable. The volumes, materials and detailing of these rooms can with minor alterations be brought back to their historic conditions, which demonstrate well the original architectural intentions that generated the building. A large percentage of the elements and details that determine the character of the building are intact in secondary, service areas like stairs and toilet rooms. The corridors and office areas themselves have been diminished in volume and have lost significant portions of their original elements and finishes. On the first floor, key elements like the patterned multi-colored terrazzo floor, the decorative plaster ceiling of the Post Office Lobby and the framework for the skylight monitor above the Postal Work Area are largely intact and recoverable. These assets can be reclaimed if current finishes covering them are removed and the spaces involved are replanned to take advantage of their existence. Gallery Murals by Julius Woeltz at the J.

As an author, he is known for his work with Neil Howe on social generations and for Strauss‚ÄìHowe generational theory. He is also known as the co-founder and director of the satirical musical theater group the Capitol Steps, and as the co-founder of the Cappies, a critics and awards program for high school theater students.  Biography  Strauss was born in Chicago and grew up in Burlingame, California. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969. In 1973, he received a JD from Harvard Law School and a master's in public policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, where he was a member of the program's first graduating class. After receiving his degrees, Strauss worked in Washington, DC as a policy aid to the Presidential Clemency Board, directing a research team writing a report on the impact of the Vietnam War on the generation that was drafted. In 1978, Strauss and Lawrence Baskir co-authored two books on the Vietnam War, Chance and Circumstance, and Reconciliation after Vietnam. Strauss later worked at the U.S. Department of Energy and as a committee staffer for Senator Charles Percy, and in 1980 he became chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Government Processes. In 1981, Strauss organized a group of senate staffers to perform satirical songs at the annual office Christmas party of his employer, Senator Percy. The group was so successful that Strauss went on to co-found a professional satirical troupe, the Capitol Steps, with Elaina Newport. The Capitol Steps is now a $3 million company with more than 40 employees who perform at venues across the country. As director, Strauss wrote many of the songs, performed regularly off Broadway, and recorded 27 albums. During the 1990s, Strauss developed another career as an historian and pop sociologist, examining how generational differences shape attitudes, behaviors, and the course of history. He wrote seven books on social generations with Neil Howe, beginning with Generations in 1991. In 1997, Strauss and Howe founded LifeCourse Associates, a publishing, speaking, and consulting company built on their generational theory. As a partner at LifeCourse, Strauss worked as a corporate, nonprofit, education, and government affairs consultant. In 1999, Strauss received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. This prompted him to found the Cappies, a program to inspire the next generation of theater performers and writers. Now an international program including hundreds of high schools, Cappies allows students to attend and review each other's plays and musicals, publish reviews in major newspapers, and hold Tonys-style Cappies award Galas, in which Strauss acted as MC for the Fairfax County program. Strauss also founded Cappies International Theater, a summer program in which top Cappies winners perform plays and musicals written by teenagers. In 2006 and 2007, Strauss advised creative teams of students who wrote two new musicals, Edit:Undo and Senioritis. Senioritis was made into a movie that was released in 2007. Death  Strauss died of pancreatic cancer in his home in McLean, Virginia. His wife of 34 years, Janie Strauss, lives in McLean and is a member of the Fairfax County School Board. They have four grown children. Work Strauss authored multiple books on social generations, as well as a number of plays and musicals. In 1978, he and Lawrence Baskir co-authored Chance and Circumstance, a book about the Vietnam-era draft. Their second book, Reconciliation After Vietnam (1978) \\"was said to have influenced\\" President Jimmy Carter's blanket pardon of Vietnam draft resisters. Strauss's books with Neil Howe include Generations (1991) and The Fourth Turning (1997), which examine historical generations and describe a theorized cycle of recurring mood eras in American History (now described as the Strauss-Howe generational theory). Generations made a deep impression on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called it the most stimulating book on American history he'd ever read. He even sent a copy to each member of Congress. The Fourth Turning made a deep impression on Steve Bannon, who wrote and directed Generation Zero (2010), a Citizens United Productions film on the book's theory, prior to his becoming White House Chief Strategist. Howe and Strauss also co-authored 13th Gen (1993) about Generation X, and Millennials Rising (2000) about the Millennial Generation. Eric Hoover has called the authors pioneers in a burgeoning industry of consultants, speakers and researchers focused on generations. He wrote a critical piece about the concept of \\"generations\\" and the \\"Millennials\\" (a term coined by Strauss and Howe) for the Chronicle of Higher Education. Michael Lind offered his critique of Howe's book \\"Generations\\" for the New York Times. Strauss also wrote a number of application books with Howe about the Millennials‚Äô impact on various sectors, including Millennials Go to College (2003, 2007), Millennials in the Pop Culture (2005), and Millennials in K-12 Schools (2008). Strauss wrote three musicals, MaKiddo, Free-the-Music.com, and Anasazi, and two plays, Gray Champions and The Big Bump, about various themes in the books he has co- authored with Howe. He also co-wrote two books of political satire with Elaina Newport, Fools on the Hill (1992) and Sixteen Scandals (2002).

Like his competitors, Glass employs \\"customer girls\\" to entertain out-of-town buyers. However, his clients have become tired of his hard-bitten \\"gold diggers\\" and have started taking their business elsewhere. Tommy Nelson (Regis Toomey), one of his salesmen, suggests that they use their stenographers instead. Glass decides to give it a try. When buyer Luther Haines (Hugh Herbert) sees Tommy's secretary and fiancee, Florence \\"Flo\\" Denny (Loretta Young), he wants to take her out. However, Tommy manages to steer him to the curvaceous Birdie (Suzanne Kilborn) instead. Later, with Birdie sick, Tommy reluctantly lets Flo go on a date with another buyer, Daniel \\"Danny\\" Drew (Lyle Talbot). They have a nice time together, but she is shocked when she finds out Danny expects sex. A contrite Danny apologizes and tells her that he has fallen in love with her. He has to go on a business trip, but telephones and writes to her regularly. Meanwhile, Flo's friend, fellow employee and roommate, Maizee (Winnie Lightner), shows her that Tommy is cheating on her with Birdie. She ends their engagement. To keep her self- respect, Flo tells Glass that she will not go out with any more buyers. When he threatens to fire her, she quits. Danny returns and takes Flo to dinner. Then, spotting Haines at another table, he asks her to help convince the last holdout to a merger to sign an important contract, the biggest deal of his life. She is disappointed by his request, but agrees to do it. She goes to dinner with Haines, but cleverly arranges with Maizee to have Haines' wife (Helen Ware) and daughter show up. Haines has to go along with the pretense that he is conducting business, and signs the contract. When Haines later complains about Flo's methods, and claims that she and Tommy are living together, Daniel suspects that she is not as innocent as he believed, so he drives her out into the country to the mansion of his friends. Nobody is home, but he coaxes her inside and tries to force himself on her. Flo tries to get away, but finally stops resisting. However, when she asks him if that is all she means to him, Danny stops before anything happens. She leaves, only to run into Tommy, who had followed the couple. He also believes she is selling herself. Danny, overhearing their conversation, realizes that Flo is innocent, and forces Tommy to apologize. Danny begs her to marry him.

Nugent added: \\"The unfortunate part of it is that the picture has some bright lines and threatens, here and there, actually to become amusing.

The crossing can be reached by New York State Route 30 on the American side and by Quebec Route 138 on the Canadian side. Historically, Trout River was the primary crossing of the Trout River, NY port of Entry. This distinction is due to the fact that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection defines a port of entry as 'any designated place at which a CBP officer is authorized to accept entries of merchandise to collect duties, and to enforce the various provisions of the customs and navigation laws'. This means that the border stations of Fort Covington and Churubusco are facilities of the Trout River Port of Entry. There are several buildings near this crossing that were built prior to the establishment of the US-Canada border in 1842. These include a former duty-free shop and two residences. US Border Facilities at Trout River The Trout River Border Inspection Station is one of seven existing border inspection stations built on the New York - Quebec border between 1931 and 1934.General Services Administration page on the Trout River Border Inspection Station. In 2014 it, along with others around the country built during this period, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architectural Significance US border station at Trout River as seen in 1932Border Stations are associated with four important events in United States history: the imposition of Prohibition between 1919 and 1933; enactment of the Elliott-Fernald Public Buildings Act in 1926 which was followed closely by the Great Depression; and the popularity of the automobile whose price was increasingly affordable thanks to Henry Ford's creation of the industrial assembly line. The stations were constructed as part of the government's program to improve its public buildings and to control casual smuggling of alcohol which most often took place in cars crossing the border. Their construction was also seen as a means of giving work to the many locally unemployed. The Trout River border station is one of the best preserved in New York. While the border stations have all sustained systematic alterations, they have retained, in varying degrees, most of their original fabric. This station is on both exterior and interior a fine example of the building type, its character defining features well-maintained and intact. The building was designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, during the tenure of Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, and constructed from 1931 to 1932. At the time of its construction, Louis A. Simon was Superintendent of the Architectural Section. Border stations were constructed by the federal government in New England along the border with Canada during the 1930s and several common plans and elevations can be discerned among the remaining stations. Trout River shares with the others a residential scale, a Neo-colonial style, and an organization to accommodate functions of both customs and immigration services. History The era of Prohibition begun in 1919 with the Volstead Act and extended nationwide by the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1920, resulted in massive bootlegging along the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In New York, early efforts to control bootlegging were carried out by a small number of Customs officers and border patrol officers who were often on foot and horseback. In many cases New York Custom Houses were a mile or so south of the border and travelers were expected to stop in and report their purchases. The opportunity to remedy this situation and support enforcement of the Prohibition laws was offered by enactment of the Elliott-Fernald Public Buildings Act of 1926 which authorized the government through the Treasury Department to accelerate its building program and began its allocation with $150,000,000 which it later increased considerably. Trout River was west of the so-called Rum Trail which made Route 9 the chief path of entry for bootlegged liquor in upstate New York. Bootleggers however, ran liquor across the border at Trout River and it was a vulnerable spot for smuggling . At the time Prohibition was repealed, the Trout River border inspection station had been in operation for two years. However, the end of Prohibition did not mean the end of smuggling, as the public had developed a taste for Canadian liquor and its bootleggers had discovered the money that could be made smuggling raw alcohol into Canada where prices for it were considerably higher. Trout River continued to operate to interdict this activity. While the seven New York border inspection stations had been designated for construction as early as 1929, land acquisition and the designing and bidding process was stalled at various stages for each of the buildings and their construction took place unevenly over a period of five years. Trout River was the first station to be constructed. It is still in active use. The Trout River Border Inspection Station is one of seven border stations in New York which are eligible for the National Register, having national, state and local significance. The station is associated with three events which converged to make a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history: Prohibition, the Public Buildings Act of 1926 and the mass-production of automobiles. Although this border station was not completed until a year before the repeal of Prohibition, it was planned and built as a response to the widespread bootlegging which took place along the border with Canada and continued to serve as important role after 1933 when smuggling continued in both directions across the border. Conceived in a period of relative prosperity, the Public Buildings Act came to have greater importance to the country during the Depression and funding was accelerated to bring stimulus to state and local economies by putting to work many of the unemployed in building and then manning the stations. Local accounts make clear the number of jobs the station created. Local labor was used to build the station and Trout River residents were appointed customs inspectors. The Trout River Border Inspection Station is associated with the life of Louis A. Simon, FAIA, who as Superintendent of the Architect's Office and then as Supervising Architect of the Procurement Division of the United States Treasury Department was responsible for the design of hundreds of government buildings between 1905 and 1939. During his long tenure with the government, Simon, trained in architecture at MIT, was instrumental in the image of the government projected by its public buildings, an image derived from classical western architecture, filtered perhaps through the English Georgian style or given a regional gloss, but one which continues to operate in the collective public vision of government. Simon was unwavering in his defense of what he considered a \\"conservative-progressive\\" approach to design in which he saw \\"art, beauty, symmetry, harmony and rhythm\\".American Architect and Architecture (August, 1937), vol. 151, p. 51. The border inspection stations do not individually possess high artistic values, but they do represent a distinguishable entity, that of United States Border Stations whose components are nonetheless of artistic value. This station at Trout River is an excellent example of the choice of the Georgian Revival style which was considered appropriate for the upstate New York region. It is also the second most elaborate of the stations. Its construction is of the highest quality materials and workmanship. It has integrity of setting and feeling associated with its function, and has retained the integrity of its materials. Architectural description The Trout River Border Inspection Station in located on the north east corner of the intersection of New York State Route 30 and the Westville Road in a small cluster of buildings which date c.1850 to 1900. The Canada border station is in view on the north while open space surrounds this rural village in all directions. From the north, pavement markings and signage divert cars to the station's three lane inspection bays via an oval, concrete drive. The east facing building is set on a flat, grass covered lot, 57,270 square feet in area, flanked by two mature hemlock trees which appear to be over fifty years old. Public parking is provided on the south side of the building. The red-brick station is an example of Georgian Revival architecture. It was built in a three-part plan composed of a -story center block with two single-story wings on its north and south facades and a three-lane inspection canopy extending from its east facade. The center block is five bays wide with five clapboard-sided, front gable dormers placed on the slate-covered gambrel roof on both east and west elevations. There are two interior end chimneys. Brickwork quoins ornament the building corners with cast-stone keystones and sills at each of the window openings. On the first floor, sash is the original 12/12. On the second floor, the dormer window openings are arched with 8/8 Gothic sash. The center entry has a replacement glass-and-aluminum door. The north and south wings of the building are divided into four arched vehicle bays on the east and four bays of 12/12 sash on the west facade. They are a single bay in width beneath slate-covered hip roofs. Quoins are repeated at the wing corners. On the south wing, the inspection shed, one bay has been converted to a handicapped bathroom which is entered beneath a small wooden hood. On the north wing, the garage, one bay opening has been altered to serve as a pedestrian entry. The flat-roofed inspection canopy which extends to the east in three lanes is topped by a wrought iron railing on three sides and supported by a combination of five original paneled wooden piers and seven replacement metal columns. On the interior of the main block the first floor is divided into a public vestibule and office space by two L-shaped, panelled counters. Separating the immigration offices from the customs offices on each side of the space is a relatively narrow wood stairway to the basement and second floor. Interior finishes throughout the building are largely intact with plaster walls and ceilings, and architrave door surrounds. Flooring on the first level is original red tile set in a concrete border. Linoleum has been added in the offices. The basement is devoted to mechanical rooms with the unusual exception of two room size safes. The second floor is divided into office spaces, with two bathrooms which retain their original pedestal sinks, tile floor and walls and wooden stall partitions. New lighting fixtures have been hung throughout the building. In 1958 the alterations to the canopy supports were made and in 1968 the main entry was replaced, and the accessible bathroom was added. A back-up generator was installed in 1976 in the basement. Canadian Border Facilities at Trout River The Canada border station at the Trout River crossing is a neo-Tudor design. It is a 1 1/2-story, Tudor Revival structure with a gabled roof and dormers. It also has and bell cast eaves supported on heavy brackets. Stucco walls contrast with decorative half timbering that was originally charcoal- colored, is currently painted red. The designation is confined to the footprint of the building. Built in 1933, the CBSA border station at Trout River is among the oldest border facilities still in operation. The Tudor style was used at other border stations such as Beebe and Lacolle. This building was designated by the Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office as a Recognized Federal Heritage Building in 1991.

Plot Tip Toes (Dorothy Gish) and her two partners Uncle Hen (Rogers) and Al (Nelson Keys) have a struggling music-hall act. When they go for auditions, theatre managers are keen on Tip Toes as a solo, but do not want the men. Tip Toes turns down offers to go it alone out of loyalty to her fellows. In deep financial trouble, they decide as a last throw of the dice to book into a suite at a high-class hotel and put the story about that Tip Toes is a sophisticated heiress, while she tries to snag a wealthy gentleman. Tip Toes attracts the interest of a young peer, but the plans of the trio are constantly on the point of being undermined as Hen and Al get into a series of scrapes. Cast * Dorothy Gish as Tip Toes Kaye * Will Rogers as Uncle Hen Kaye * Nelson Keys as Al Kaye * Miles Mander as Rollo Stevens * Dennis Hoey as Hotelier * John Manners as Lord William Montgomery Production A writer was paid ¬£2,000 to do a script but Wilcox threw it out. Paramount contributed only ¬£20,000 of the production cost. Reception Tip Toes was the last in a four- picture deal between Wilcox and Paramount to star Gish in British films. The earlier films (Nell Gwyn, London and Madame Pompadour) had all been relatively favourably received by contemporary critics; however Tip Toes appears to have attracted almost universally negative responses. The Bioscope dismissed it as \\"feeble\\", while Variety accused the film of being \\"not only a libel on Americans, but on American vaudeville and its artists\\". The film lost money. Preservation status No print of Tip Toes is known to survive, and the British Film Institute include it on their '\\"75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films. It is considered of great potential interest to silent cinema historians, not only as a prestige production involving star names, but to assess whether it really was a disastrous misfire justifying its terrible reception, or whether a modern perspective would view the film more kindly.

Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov (transliterated at the time as Trepoff) (15 December 1850 ‚Äì 15 September 1906) was Head of the Moscow police, Governor-General of St. Petersburg with extraordinary powers, and Assistant Interior Minister with full control of the police.Russian Chronology His attempts to restore order were overwhelmed by the revolution of 1905; he retained influence with the Tsar Nicholas II, when appointed as the Commandant of the Imperial Palace.  Life  Dmitri was the second son of General Fyodor Trepov who was involved in the suppression of the January Uprising in 1864 and appointed as the mayor of St. Petersburg. Dmitri was the brother of A. F. Trepov, Vladimir F. Trepov, and F. F. Trepov, Jr. After his education and training in the Corps des Pages, Trepov participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78). After being promoted to head of the police of Moscow, in July, 1877, Alexei Bogolyubov, a Polish inmate, refused to remove his cap before Trepov's father, Fyodor. In response, Bogolyubov was sentenced by Fyodor to be flogged. This occurred at the time of the Trial of the 193, a mass trial of students accused of \\"disobedience\\" and charged with treason. In response to these two acts of barbarism, Vera Zasulich attempted to assassinate Fyodor, shooting at him but only wounding him, after which he retired. Trepov was involved in the 'Third Section', named by Grand Duke Sergei, Governor General of Moscow Governorate. In 1896 he became Chief Police of Moscow, where he took a strong line against student agitators. The year after he was shot and wounded in his leg. A few days after Bloody Sunday (1905), on 12 January 1905 (O.S.), Trepov was appointed in St. Petersburg (then the capital of the Russian Empire) to become Governor General of the Saint Petersburg Governorate with full power to forbid all congresses, associations, or meetings. He took his residence in the Winter Palace. Along with Plehve and Count Ignatyev Trepov promoted a policy of repression and anti-Jewish persecution. He personally edited pamphlets.O. Figes (1996) A People's Tragedy. The Russian Revolution 1891-1924, p. 197. Dmitriy Trepov At the beginning of June 1905 he was appointed Assistant Minister of the Interior under Alexander Bulygin: he appeared to acquiesce in Prime Minister Count Witte's reforms. Trepov, protected by Vladimir Freedericksz, was described by Witte as the unofficial dictator of the country, ruling the government. Trepov allowed students in September the right to assemble on university campuses, and removed the police, but one month later he was urging ‚Äúthe most drastic measures‚Äù to end the strike of railway workers. Trepov ordered provincial police to ‚Äúact in the most drastic manner...not stopping at the direct application of force.‚Äù On 14 October (O.S) he gave orders to ‚ÄúSpare no cartridges and use no blanks‚Äù: the police and the army ignored the order. The police surrounded the University of St. Petersburg, forbade rallies, and threatened to clear the campus by force. Trepov warned the Tsar that order could not be forcibly restored without very heavy bloodshed. A few days later he did sign the October Manifesto, in which his dismissal was one of the demands. Trepov sent in his resignation. There were demonstrations for and against the Manifesto, and street fighting in St. Petersburg between the Black Hundreds and workers. On 26 October (O.S.) the Tsar appointed Trepov without consulting Premier Witte Master of the Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, and had daily contact with the Emperor; his influence at court was paramount. Late June, after the dissolution of the First Duma, he promoted a cabinet with only Kadets, which in his opinion would soon enter into a violent conflict with the Emperor and fail. He secretly met with Pavel Milyukov.Lessons from History: Russia‚Äôs Parliament Turns 105 He opposed to Pyotr Stolypin, promoting a coalition cabinet.Recollections Of A Foreign Minister (1921) Memoirs of Alexander Isvolsky Trepov was a lifelong reactionary/anti reformist, like his father. He strongly believed that autocracy was the only way for Russia. Trepov was subject to many assassination threats - some of those involved stated that he was in fact safe on the streets, as he had been marked for assassination in his own bedroom; two of his nieces were among those who attempted to assassinate him. In early July assassins tried to kill him at Peterhof Palace, but he died of angina pectoris, having trouble with his heart. there are a number of other references there and in The Times References Category:1850 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Imperial Russian politicians Category:Russian police chiefs Category:Russian police officers ","title":"Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov"},{"id":"29164939","text":"InsideCounsel magazineAbout InsideCounsel at InsideCounsel Website is a U.S.-based business-to-business monthly publication.

He was chairman of the JASON Defense Advisory Group from 1966 to 1973, and was active in US government investigations into safety of nuclear reactors. In his 1990 book Technological Risk he warned of the risks of global warming. In 2010, after 67 years of membership, he resigned from the American Physical Society, citing what he saw as \\"the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it‚Äù.https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201011/memberresigns.cfm Career as a physicist Lewis entered New York University in 1940 and graduated in physics. He earned a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley from 1943 to 1944 before joining the Navy, where he served in World War II as an electronics technician. After the war, he returned to the University of California, Berkeley, and earned his Ph.D. in Physics studying under J. Robert Oppenheimer. His focus was high energy physics (cosmic rays and elementary particles). He, along with the other theoretical physics professors at Berkeley, refused to sign the McCarthy era loyalty oath on principle, and in 1950 went to Princeton. Later, when offered reinstatement at Berkeley, he chose instead to accept a position at Bell Labs where he did research on superconducting materials. In 1956 he left Bell Labs to join the University of Wisconsin, Madison to work on solid state physics and plasmas. In 1964, he left to join the University of California, Santa Barbara as a full professor, and later chairman, in their growing physics department. He retired from UCSB in 1991. He wrote a text on the trade-offs between technological advances and risks,H. W. Lewis, Technological Risk, W.W.Norton, 1992 and also authored a popular book on decision making.H. W. Lewis, Why Flip a Coin: The Art and Science of Good Decisions, Wiley, 1997 In 1991 Harold Lewis won the Science Writing Award for his book 'Technological Risk'.AIP Science Writing Award winners Lewis was chairman of the JASON Defense Advisory Group from 1966 to 1973, when he worked on the issue of missile defense. He was a long- term member of the Defense Science Board (DSB), and chaired a 1985 DSB Task Force (with Stephen Schneider) on nuclear winter.Lawrence Badash, 2009, A nuclear winter's tale: science and politics in the 1980s, p. 163. MIT Press, Lewis was active in the field of safety of nuclear power plants. In 1975, he chaired a year-long study of light-water reactor safety for the American Physical Society (APS). Lewis chaired the 1977-1979 Risk Assessment Review for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Views on climate change In his 1990 book Technological Risk, Lewis wrote that \\"all models agree that the net effect\\" of increasing greenhouse gases \\"will be a general and global warming of the earth; they only disagree about how much. None suggest that it will be a minor effect, to be ignored while we go about our business.\\" Reducing the effects, including significant sea level rise, would \\"require global cooperation and sacrifice now, to avert something far in the future, and a conjectural something at that. There is no evidence in human history that is in the cards, but one can always hope.\\" In a letter dated 6 October 2010, Lewis wrote to Curtis Callan, President of the American Physical Society (APS), resigning from the society. Lewis said that he had joined the APS 67 years previously, when it was \\"as yet uncorrupted by the money flood\\" which he said had \\"become the raison d‚Äô√™tre of much physics research, the vital sustenance of much more, and it provides the support for untold numbers of professional jobs.\\" In his view, it was \\"the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist.\\" This letter of resignation was made public, and \\"Lewis was vaulted to celebrity status by conservative and contrarian Web sites and commentators\\". On 12 October, the climate change denialist think-tank The Global Warming Policy Foundation announced that Lewis had agreed to join their \\"Academic Advisory Council\\". On 12 October the APS issued a statement that there was no truth in Lewis's accusations; it pointed out that the vast majority of its membership works in areas not dealing with climate change, and its policy statements were developed in accordance with strict ethical standards. The APS completely rejected Lewis's claims of \\"scam\\" and \\"fraud\\", stating that virtually all reputable scientists were agreed on observations of human caused global warming. In a personal reply, Callan criticized Lewis's disrespectful allegations about colleagues. Responding to complaints Lewis raised alleging rejection of a petition for a Topical Group on Climate Science, Callan said the proposal had been accepted and was being implemented, but unfortunately Lewis had decided to resign rather than participate.

It currently is part of Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus. Significance The Federal Building-U.S. Post Office in Phoenix, Arizona is significant on a local level in two areas: architecture and politics/government. A good example of federal architecture adapted to a regional tradition, in this case the Spanish Colonial Revival, the building was erected during the years 1932 to 1936. Part of an extensive federal building program initiated in the late 1920s, it housed the main post office of Phoenix for over thirty years, as well as the offices of the judiciary and several federal agencies. A few years after opening, murals commissioned by Treasury Department were installed in the lobby. Substantially intact, the Federal Building-Post Office continues to function as a post office branch and its tenants include the United States Tax Court and assorted federal entities. The construction of the Post Office marked Phoenix's rapid growth and its important position as the state capital. Founded in 1870-71, Phoenix had a series of post office facilities until 1913, when the U. S. Treasury Department built the Phoenix Post Office and Courthouse. By 1930, the city had outgrown the building, and Congress appropriated the funds for a new building. The Phoenix Federal Building would be one of the results of the massive federal building program underway at the time, partially in an attempt to combat the deepening Depression. A site was chosen in 1931 and Phoenix architects Lescher and Mahoney were commissioned to design a six-story building that was intended to house all of the federal services in the city. Construction was begun on the foundations. For a variety of reasons, including the unexpectedly high cost of land acquisition, the design for a three-story rather than a six-story building was submitted to the Treasury Department for review. By the time construction bids were again sought, the building had assumed a Spanish Colonial Revival appearance and two story height. The building opened on September 29, 1936 of that year when the post office began operations in its new home. A landmark in central Phoenix, the Federal Building-Post Office was symbolic of the federal presence in the City and a focus of local pride. It continues today in those capacities, although construction of a new post office in 1968 absorbed several of its tenants. The only federal building from the period remaining in the city, the Post Office possesses substantial architectural merit as an example of Spanish Colonial Revival design. Progress of the Pioneer, Crossing the Desert by La Verne Nelson Black Progress of the Pioneer, the Arrival of the U.S. Mail Coach by La Verne Nelson Black Murals In 1938, the Fine Arts Section of the Treasury Department commissioned artists La Verne Black and Oscar E. Berninghaus to paint two murals each to embellish the public space of the office. Communication During the Period of Exploration by Oscar Berninghaus Spanish Explorers and American Indians by Oscar Berninghaus Architectural description The Post Office is located several blocks north of the center of downtown Phoenix. It occupies a large parcel bounded on the east by North Central Avenue, on the north by West Fillmore Street, on the west by North First Avenue, and on the south by the post office driveway and receiving area. It was designed with three principal elevations. While the Fillmore street elevation is technically the front of the building, the east and west elevations are mirror images of each other and contain the public entries. A Spanish Colonial Revival theme, influenced by the proportions and symmetry of the Italian Renaissance, was chosen for the building. In plan, the building consists of a two-story rectangular mass 193 feet wide by 165 feet deep, with a second, smaller rectangular wing, 127 feet by 60 feet, centered on the rear elevation. A tiled hip roof crowns the main wing while the rear wing is flat- roofed. A frieze containing attic vents bands the entire structure. The building has a full basement, illuminated on the principal elevations by large light wells bordered by wrought iron railings. Cement stucco sheathes the exterior above a rusticated concrete plinth which simulates granite in its appearance. Trim is primarily cast stone and concentrated around the entries on the east and west and the end bays on the north, each of which is distinguished by ornate, Classical treatments. Bays are defined solely by the fenestration. The building has a composite type structural system which utilizes steel framing for beams and columns and poured reinforced concrete for floor slabs and fireproofing around the steel. It rests upon three-tiered spread footings of reinforced concrete, large enough to carry additional stories. Foundation walls are of poured reinforced concrete while the exterior walls above the foundation are constructed of brick masonry. Interior walls are generally hollow terra cotta tile. In plan and in architectural character, the three floors of the building are generally quite distinct from each other. The basement is utilitarian, with an L-shaped corridor providing access to various storage, service, and mechanical areas. As the main public level, the first floor contains the most architecturally detailed space, the post office lobby which runs the width of the building. Suites of offices occupy the space north of the lobby while bays of post office boxes and the post office workroom are located to the south. Additional office space is arranged around the generally F-shaped corridor of the second story. Light courts fill in the open spaces of the \\"F.\\" Architectural integrity of the Federal Building-Post Office is generally quite high on the exterior but somewhat impaired on the interior. The most significant alterations include the replacement of the original entry doors; painting of the cast stone exterior trim; installation of wood entry vestibules and new post office box vestibules in the post office lobby; closure of several original post office service window bays; and remodeling of many of the offices. Arizona State University The building currently is part of Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus. It houses such functions as student organizations, counseling services, administrative offices and the ASU Police Department.

Dillon U.S. Courthouse Building is the headquarters for the Buffalo Fire Department and Buffalo Police department and serves as a public safety building. The building had previously served as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Built in 1936, the building was renamed Michael J. Dillon Memorial U.S. Courthouse in 1986 in honor of murdered IRS Revenue Officer Michael J. Dillon. It is located at 68 Court Street. Building history The monolithic U.S. Courthouse in Buffalo, officially rededicated in 1987 in honor of longtime Internal Revenue Service employee Michael J. Dillon, occupies an entire block along Niagara Square, the city's civic center since 1802. Construction of the seven-story sandstone and steel courthouse in 1936 resulted from Buffalo's evolution as one of the country's most important industrial centers, which brought numerous federal agencies to the city. The courthouse concentrated the federal presence in an excellent example of the Art Moderne architecture favored for government buildings funded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs.General Services Administration page on the Michael J. Dillon Memorial United States Courthouse. Federal government facilities had become so overcrowded by 1928 that the citizens of Buffalo pressured Congress for a new building to house all Federal offices in the city. The Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932 authorized the construction of a number of federal buildings, including the Dillon Courthouse. Under the authority of the 1926 Public Buildings Act, the Office of the Supervising Architect was responsible for the design of all federal buildings. Due to economic pressures on small architectural firms during the Depression, local architects received some of these commissions. In January 1933, the Supervising Architect's Office retained two influential Buffalo firms, Green and Sons and Bley and Lyman, to prepare plans for the new courthouse. Because of the unusual shape of the site, the architects created a pentagonal building. The courthouse is a unique example of Art Moderne architecture because of its unusual shape and low-relief carved ornament. Originally planned as a twelve-story building, limited funding reduced its size to seven stories. President Roosevelt dedicated the courthouse on October 17, 1936 ‚Äî his speech emphasizing the vital partnership between the Federal government and local officials in creating public works to overcome the devastating effects of the Depression. In 2004, the Dillon Courthouse was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing element of the Joseph Ellicott Historic District in Buffalo. After completion of Robert H. Jackson United States Courthouse in 2012, Dillon Courthouse became vacant. In 2016 building was acquired by the City of Buffalo. Buffalo paid $1 for the courthouse and allocated $1.9 million for the renovation costs. Architecture The courthouse occupies the entire block bounded by Niagara Street, Niagara Square, Court Street and Franklin Street. This block is irregularly-shaped, and slopes gently to the west-southwest. It is located in the central business district in an area described as the \\"civic center\\" because the courthouse, state office building, City Hall, and City Court, building are all located around Niagara Square. Constructed in 1935, this building is an unusually-shaped example of starved classicism, a style of Federal architecture that was prominent during this period. There are elements of Deco in the details. The courthouse is seven stories in height, not including the penthouse structure. The building rests on a granite base, the height of which varies with the slope of the site. The building appears as a solid geometric mass, with planar walls and sparing detail. The height of the building from the first floor platform to the top of the seventh floor parapet is approximately 105 feet. There are seven bays along Court Street, and ten bays along Franklin Street. These bays create the principal structural grid; however, a secondary grid is created by the diagonal along Niagara Street, which is made up of seven bays. There are five bays along Niagara Square, which is part of the principal grid. All floor plans have the same pentagonal shape; however, the upper two floors are set back from the primary building plane. The building is clad in yellow-grey sandstone panels with cast aluminum spandrel panels and carved sandstone detailing. The windows are organized one above the other in vertical openings in the stone cladding. All windows have galvanized steel sash and frames, and are all either double-hung or fixed-sash with operable awning windows. Detailing is concentrated at the entries, the first-floor level, and building parapets. One of the two main building entries is located at approximately the midpoint of the Court Street elevation. A smooth stone surround projects slightly from the building plane, where the doors and transoms are recessed slightly. The stone surround is capped by a monumental carved eagle and the words \\"United States Court House\\" are incised into the stone above the entry. The entry doors, frames, and transoms are cast aluminum with ornamental grillework and a cast bronze medallion over the center door. The second entry is at Niagara Street, and is identical except there is no entry platform. There are several significant and generally original spaces in the interior. The main lobby, post office lobby and financial lobby link visually on the first floor and are distinguished from each other by ceiling height and columns. The post office lobby has writing desks with ornamental cast aluminum frames, aluminum window frames and details in the post office screen, and lantern light fixtures in each column that match those of the vestibules. The floors are buff terrazzo bordered in dark green marble with matching marble base. At intervals along the main lobby floor are circle and star patterns of colored terrazzo. The walls and columns are clad in travertine, except where the financial lobby has been remodeled. The ceiling in the main lobby has a fretwork molding with floral panels, which are polychrome. All trim is travertine, and at the elevators there are dark green marble pilasters topped by bronze medallions at each end and between each elevator. The light fixtures in the main lobby are drum shaped and have aluminum frames with a star motif. There are four original courtrooms in the building. The main ceremonial courtrooms A and D are on axis, off a common lobby on the 6th floor; courtroom C is on the seventh floor, and the Bankruptcy Court is on the 4th floor. The Bankruptcy Courtroom has wood panel wainscot with molded cap, dark green marble border and base and plaster walls and ceilings. The ceilings have an ornamental plaster cornice with six plaster ceiling medallions, from which are suspended original hexagonal bronze light fixtures. The Courtroom C is on the seventh floor. The walls of this courtroom are covered with wood paneling with elaborate detailing. There is a dark green marble base and wood wainscot with molded cap. The upper panels are vertical grain wood. The judge's bench and jury box have a carved band around the top, and dark green marble base. The solid court rail has the same detailing as the wainscot. The plaster ceiling has a polychrome ornamental band of fretwork motif and two rows of three plaster medallions from which original bowl-shaped bronze light fixtures hang. The ceremonial courtrooms - A and B - on the sixth floor are almost identical. These courtrooms are accented with a dark green marble base which continues around the base of the judges bench. There is wood wainscot with wood moldings and wainscot cap. The wainscot extends around the courtroom and is broken by the entry doors and the panel behind the judge's bench. On either side of the judge's bench, the wall above the wainscot is paneled in wood. There is a fluted wood pilaster at each front corner of the courtroom also topped with carved wood eagles. The courtroom doors are centered in the east wall and are leather-covered panel doors, with bronze stars inserted in each panel. The surround is wood with a pedimented head, a laurel wreath and shield in the pediment. An elaborate ornamental plaster band around the ceiling is composed of alternating squares with stars and flowers. There are six original light fixtures that are drum-shaped. The Judges' Chambers with their wood paneled walls and molded plaster ceilings are also significant. On the fourth floor is the original U.S. Commissioner's Hearing Room, now a law library. This room is elaborately detailed with dark green marble border and base, wood wainscot and ornamental molded cornice with medallions. The elevator lobbies retain the original dark green marble wainscot and door surrounds, and most of the public corridors retain the original terrazzo flooring. With the exception of minor detailing, the tenant spaces have been altered. One significant original finish that is still present in many corridor areas is the hollow metal doors, chair rail, and surrounds throughout the building. The metal was grained to resemble wood, and operable transom hardware was internal. While the exact layouts of the upper floors varies depending on the original uses, the general layout of corridors and offices is very similar. The elevator lobbies line up vertically above the main lobby, with elevators and stairs on the west side, and restrooms located on the east side of the lobbies. There are generally offices around the perimeter of the building with H-shaped or pentagonal corridors just to the interior of the offices. The mechanical and support spaces are centralized.

There is a branch of fiction which specialises in such themes science fiction. In such works, the laws of science are commonly distorted as a form of artistic license.  History  Before the 19th century, new discoveries or developments in science did not uniformly influence society. The average farmer would have no knowledge of a new surgical technique or newly discovered element, and even if they did know about it, they may not understand all the research and mechanisms of it. As industrialization and urbanization rose, people began leaving their homes to go work in the large factories, which had a negative impact on traditional beliefs. The new scientific knowledge was challenging traditional beliefs and bringing up new questions that were never thought of before, and that intrigued the public. One still argued example is the argument of evolution. Even though it had provided somewhat of an answer of where did we come from, it also went against what the church said, and thus became controversial. People started to learn about new ideas and ways of thinking while being exposed to new kinds of people while working. There was a shift, beginning in the 19th century, of scientific and technological knowledge being inserted into people's everyday lives. This was due to knowledge becoming more appealing and accepted by entrepreneurs, who would then publicize those ideas to the public. One example is the development of the lobotomy, and how even though it was a medical procedure, it was ridiculed by many doctors and was seen as controversial within the scientific community. The main reason it was so popular to the public was because it was better than the alternative, mental illnesses that included schizophrenia, depression, compulsive disorders, and many more. As the scientific discoveries improved peoples' lives, it became a more active participant in society to help solve some of humanity's problems. By the mid-19th century, knowledge became more specialized and institutionalized where only those that had spent years studying a topic could fully grasp the theories. As more was discovered within a given field, the more those trying to discover something new had to delve further into a specific field. For example, during the beginning of biological research scientists wanted to understand how animals were related, by creating trees of life to show how they believe each animal is related to one another, this was typically done based on the animal's traits. Now scientists have to focus microscopically to discover something new, like DNA sequences or a new protein that is involved in the complex functions of life. An emphasis in classification encourage scientists to concentrate in a single field. As scientists went deeper into their field, the separation between fields to the point that two scientists from different areas of study wouldn‚Äôt be able to discuss their respective discoveries to one another. This specialization also discouraged average citizens with no specific background in the field from learning about it. Due to the gap between the public and scientific discoveries, people began viewing some of the scientific discoveries as irrelevant since they could neither understand it or see it within their community or lives. For instance, the average person on the street wouldn't know anything about a recently discovered protein, but might know about the stock market trends. Popular science, which is a more simplified and vague version of a given scientific topic, was developed to combat the specificity of the sciences. Usually in the form of written media at the time, this allowed scientific ideas to be presented to the public in a way they could understand it. It became very popular with the public as it made science seem as though it had no boundaries, that anything was possible. From popular science stemmed science fiction, which was constructed from a blend of observations and fantasy and didn‚Äôt need consistency, since it was not truly real. It substituted science for magic since the audience didn‚Äôt necessarily need to know how it did what it did, but rather what it did do. It allowed for imagination to collide with science to form fantasy. Popular response of the sciences continues to be a combination of support and distrust depending on the topic.  Examples = Alternative worlds  Fictional worlds are worlds inhabited by fictional characters. They may be a mirror of the real world with some other-worldly traits, like in The Wizard of Oz, or can be a fictional version of our world in the past, like The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It can also be like the real world but with an alternate history, as in the Eden trilogy by Harry Harrison, where the dinosaurs were never wiped out.  Androids  Sophia, by Hanson Robotics The focus of these is the invention and use of robots that look and act like humans. Today there has been development of some prototype androids, like Sophia that was created by Hanson Robotics, who can interact with humans and engage in sophisticated but limited movement.

The aircraft received serious attention from both Fairchild Aircraft, and Cessna Aircraft in the post World War II aviation boom. Development On a cross-country fuel stop at Hagerstown, Maryland with Wittman's design, the Buttercup, Fairchild engineers expressed an interest in the design and even entered in negotiations for possible production of the aircraft. With the onset of World War II, production plans were shelved, but Fairchild contacted Wittman and proposed that a four-seat version would be marketable. Wittman designed the four-place \\"Big X\\" soon afterward. When Fairchild did not follow up on production offers, Wittman was contacted by Cessna in Wichita, Kansas, to demonstrate the lightweight and strong spring steel landing gear of the Big X. Cessna bought the plane and its production rights in order to use the gear on its new Cessna 195 taildragger. Wittman later produced an updated version in a two-place configuration called the Wittman Tailwind that became a popular homebuilt aircraft. Design The Big X was built in the same manner as Buttercup. It was steel tube fuselage with fabric covering and all-wood wings. The original Big X featured a 130 hp Franklin engine, later upgraded to a 150 hp. Operational history Big X was used as a companion plane and baggage hauler during Wittman's years as an air racer. The original aircraft was rebuilt by Forrest Lovley in 1980.

It spreads over more than 5000 acres of forest on the 'Dummiya' mountain range and is residence to about 150 Buddhist monks. Na Uyana is so named because of the old Ceylon ironwood forest that forms part of the monastery.  History  Stupa of Na Uyana Aranya, surrounded by Ceylon ironwood trees Ancient cave dwellings with BrƒÅhmƒ´ inscriptions, as well as ruins of a small Stupa complex, have been found at Na Uyana which date back to 3rd century BCE. The new stupa of the monastery is built on the location of this complex. One inscription states that King Uttiya has donated his pleasure grove to the Sangha. As Uttiya was the successor to King Devanampiya Tissa, during whose reign Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka, the ancient monastery at Na Uyana seems to have been one of the first in the country established outside Anuradhapura. The ancient monastery was rediscovered by Ven. Wigoda Bodhirakkhita Thera in 1954. Sayadaw U Nandavamsa and Sayadaw U Javana, senior Burmese disciples of Mahasi Sayadaw, visited the monastery in 1956. Ven. Angulgamuwe Ariyananda Thera moved to Na Uyana in 1997 with a group of monks and started a revival that has made it the largest monastery in the Yogasrama Samstha. It is also one of the main international monasteries in Sri Lanka, with about 25 foreign monks. Ven. Nauyane Ariyadhamma Mahathera, the Spiritual Director of Sri Kalyani Yogasrama Samstha, also used to reside at Na Uyana.  Layout  The Dummiya mountain range, home to Na Uyana Aranya. On the right side is the Pansiyagama section, on the center the 'Mountain' and on the left the Matale section. Na Uyana has 4 main sections: Pansiyagama (or Kurunegala), 'Mountain', Matale and Aandagala, each about 30 minutes of a walk apart from the other. Pansiyagama section is the ancient monastery within the ironwood forest and contains the uposatha hall, meditation hall, refectory, library and offices in addition to about 80 kutis (monks' residences). 'Mountain' is the newly developed area on the main hill of the monastery, which has about 80 kutis and the main meditation hall. This area is being reforested. Matale section, which has about 20 kutis and a smaller meditation hall, is situated among grassy hills with less forest cover. Aandagala is a remote, densely forested area in the monastery which is not in direct contact with others, and is reserved for the most austere dhutanga practitioners. There are 4 mud huts in this area, and the occupants must go on almsround to the nearby villages. Meals are provided separately for the first three sections, yet some monks prefer going for alms.  Meditation  The first floor of the meditation hall in the 'Mountain' section Na Uyana is one of the two principal meditation monasteries of the Yogasrama Samstha, along with Nissarana Vanaya. The main meditation method taught is 'Pa-Auk Samatha Vipassana',http://www.nauyana.org/myfiles/Na_Uyana_Monastery_Information_2017_Ver_1.pdf and the senior meditation teacher is Ven. Ariyananda Thera. It was possible to have interviews with Ven. Ariyadhamma Mahathera, while he was there and before he passed away. Practitioners may join the group sittings conducted in the two main meditation halls, or continue on their own in their kutis. The Most Ven. Bhaddanta ƒÄci·πá·πáa, the current Pa-Auk sayadaw, undertook a long-term personal retreat at Na Uyana Aranya in 2007, staying in seclusion and suspending his teaching schedule throughout the year.  Directions  Take the road to Madahapola at the Melsiripura junction (between Kurunegala and Dambulla) on the A6 highway. At the Pansiyagama junction on the Madahapola road, take the road to Galewela. About 1 km on this road is the Na Uyana road, which leads to the monastery.

Biography After studying electrical engineering, he entered television in 1946 with the drama Chambre 34, his directorial debut. On 24 February 1950, he produced the first live French television show by transmitting part of Marivaux's Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard and the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. His first series followed in 1950, Agence Nostradamus, which was also the first series on French television. In 1955, he staged a trial court scripted by Peter Desgraupes and Dumayet Peter (producers of the series). En votre √¢me et conscience was an original series, designed for small-screen drama, taking place entirely in a court where the camera filmed uninterrupted. In 1959, the television drama Les Trois Mousquetaires was adapted by Barma for live transmission, with the role of D'Artagnan played by the young Jean-Paul Belmondo, who would later be known for his roles in √Ä bout de souffle and Classe tous risques. In the early 1960s, he adapted three Shakespeare plays: Macbeth in 1959, Hamlet in 1960 and Othello in 1962 . In 1967, Les Enqu√™tes du commissaire Maigret depicted the popular character Jules Maigret, created by Georges Simenon. Barma oversaw the series until 1981.

In March 2010, SAGE announced more than $100 million in DOE funding and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax credits to build a new facility in Faribault, Minnesota, to mass-produce SageGlass IGUs. The company ultimately decided to withdraw from the government funding program. Shortly thereafter, the company announced a new product that combines electrochromic technology with low U-factor triple-pane window glass construction. On November 10, 2010,French glass and building materials company Saint-Gobain acquired 50 percent of the SAGE with plans to share the two companies electrochromic glass technology and research and development efforts, The companies are also building the world's first large-scale electrochromic glass plant in Faribault, Minnesota.

Dervishi \\"Kryeministrat dhe ministrat shqiptare ne 100 vjet\\" He is thought to have been brought under Ottoman service as a devshirme, but there is also possibility that his Christian parents sent him in the Bayazid II's harem-i hass, where he received a thorough indoctrination in islam in order to advance in career. His first appointment to service outside the palace was as sanjakbey of Kastamuni, and he subsequently became beylerbey of Karaman. L√ºtfi Pasha himself gave these details of his life in the introduction to his Asafname. However, he does not give the dates of his appointments and omits all details of his life before entering the Palace. He may also have served as sanjakbey first of Aydin and then of Yanya (Ioannina), since Feridun Bey mentions a L√ºtfi Bey who served at the siege of Rhodes in 1522 as sanjakbey of Aydin (Feridun Bey, M√ºn≈üe'at al-sel√¢tin, ƒ∞stanbul 1274 AH/1857) and a L√ºtfi Bey who served at the siege of Vienna in 1529 as sanjakbey of Yanya (ibid. I, 573). These references may well be to L√ºtfi Pasha, the future Grand Vizier, since the latter himself stated to have participated in both these campaigns (L√ºtfi Pasha, Tev√¢rih-i 'Al-i Osman, ed. Ali, ƒ∞stanbul 1341/1922‚Äì3, 3). In his book he laid stress on the question of whether the Ottoman sultans who were non-Arab could assume the title of caliph or not. In 941/1534‚Äì5 he became Third Vizier. By this time, he had, by his own account, served in Selim I's wars against the Safavids in Eastern Anatolia and against the Mamelukes in Syria and Egypt. Under Suleiman I, he took part in the campaigns of Belgrade in 1521 and Rhodes in 1522. He became Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire in 1539 after the death of Ayas Mehmed Pasha (who held his position for three years following the execution of Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha). In 1541 he beat his wife, Sah-ƒ± Huban Sultan, a sister of Suleiman, following her complaint of the pasha's overly harsh punishment of an adulteress. The princess divorced him with Suleiman's permission, and the sultan deposed him, naming Hadƒ±m Suleiman Pasha the new Grand Vizier. Works He wrote 21 works mainly on religious topics but also on history, 13 of them written in Arabic and 8 in Turkish. Two of his works are the Asafname, a kind of mirror for ministers, and the Tev√¢ri·∏´-i √Çl-i ‚ÄòOsÃ±m√¢n, dealing with the Ottoman history and including his own experiences in the reign of the sultans Bayezid II, Selim I and Suleyman I.E.

It was released in North America in September 1994, Japan on October 21, 1994 and in Europe in 1995. The game features the Kid Klown, the player character who is tasked with rescuing the Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. Players view gameplay from an isometric perspective as Kid Klown pursues a lit fuse in order to stop it from reaching a spade bomb. The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance and features 11 new levels, four mini-games, and a multi-player mode. The re- release was released in Europe and North America in October 2002, while a release in Japan was planned but ultimately canceled. It was met with mixed reception from critics, who found it to be inferior to other games of its type. The game has a Japan-exclusive sequel Kid Klown in Crazy Chase 2: Love Love Hani Soudatsusen released for the Sony PlayStation in 1996. Gameplay Gameplay of Kid Klown in Crazy Chase Players control the player character Kid Klown as he attempts to rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown does not make it to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage. There are 3 endings to the game: *Good Ending: The player has collected all five Honey hearts and saved Honey from the cage without using a continue. *Average Ending: The player saved Honey, but did not get all five Honey hearts, or did find all five but used a continue. *Bad Ending: The player failed to save Honey. In the Game Boy Advance re-release, the developers added 11 new levels and four unlockable mini-games, as well as a multi-player mode. Development and release Kid Klown in Crazy Chase was developed and published by Kemco for the Super NES and Game Boy Advance platforms. While the Super NES version was first released in Europe in 1995, in North America in September 1994, and in Japan on October 21, 1994, the Game Boy Advance re-release was released in October 21 and 23, 2002 in Europe and North America, respectively. The Game Boy Advance version was first revealed at E3 2001, where Kemco commented that the current build was 60% complete and would be released in Summer 2001 for Japan and November 2001 for North America. Both releases were delayed several times and the Japanese version ultimately canceled. Before release, it was featured at both E3 2002 and the 2002 Tokyo Game Show. Reception Kid Klown in Krazy Chase received mixed reception. It holds an aggregate score of 64.17% on GameRankings based on three reviews. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.375 out of 5. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 7.6 out of 10, summarizing that \\"this one requires a lot of skill and technique, but the various antics and animations (especially on Kidd's enemy) are incredibly lifelike and make this one of the better games around.\\" IGN called the Super NES version overlooked and described it as a \\"zany\\" game that \\"boasts stellar colors and some really frantic animation\\". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell described the video game J.J. & Jeff as a \\"poor man's Plok/Kid Klown in Crazy Chase/Putty Quest/etc\\". Edge compared Let's Tap to Kid Klown due to the similar challenges found in Let's Taps multi-player mode. Nintendo Life's Andrew Donaldson commented that while not a bad game, there's no reason to play it due to a lack of levels and an abundance of games that do what it does better. The Game Boy Advance version was met with similar reception. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.2 out of 5, lower than the Super NES version's score. IGN noted that the Game Boy Advance version \\"gave both good and bad impressions about Kemco's abilities to port SNES to the handheld\\" and that the multi-player mode will get it its \\"dues\\". They gave specific criticism to the early build of Crazy Chase due to the stiff controls and delayed jump. They also criticized the animation for being less fluid than the Super NES version's. GamePros Fennec Fox called the Super NES game \\"semi- obscure\\", while fellow GamePro writer DJ Dinobot criticized the Game Boy Advance's preview build for Crazy Chase for its controls were \\"harder to steer than a 1976 Pinto with a flat tire\\".

An evaluation of school facilities was done by the school system in the 1920s and with the growth in the student population in the 1930s twelve schools, including Pierce, were replaced with newer buildings. The building ceased being a school in 1940. By the end of the 1940s Mast Development Company, a research and development firm, made the building its headquarters. They built an addition onto the back of the building in 1977 that more than doubled the size of the structure. Mast moved out of the building in 1986. The following year the building was converted into Pierce School Mall, an office and retail facility. The back addition was used by a local appliance store as a warehouse. A 2005 plan to convert the building into condominiums faltered. In 2015 a $10 million renovation project to convert the facility into 41 market-rate apartments was begun. The project received historic tax credits and workforce housing tax credits from the Iowa Economic Development Authority. It was completed the following year. Architecture The 1977 addition The Pierce School building was designed by Davenport architect Parke T. Burrows of the local firm Clausen & Burrows. The square block building is two stories high on a raised basement. In the center of each elevation is a projecting pavilion that is capped with a triangular pediment. It is built with red bricks and the basement is faced with large blocks of dressed limestone. The building features a hipped roof with bracketed eaves. It has round arch windows on the main floor and rectangular windows on the second floor and on the basement level. A columned canopy covers the main entrance. The grouping of windows beneath round-arched brick arcades reflect the Richardsonian Romanesque style that was popular in the late 19th century. It is combined with a return to Neoclassicism, which is found in its symmetry of form and massing, the pavilion pediments, and the small windows in deep reveals that form a frieze.

Career Gunter was taken into partnership in 1777 by Domenico Negri who had opened a confectioner's shop in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, in 1757 under the sign of the Pot and Pine Apple.Georgian Index - Gunters In 1797 Gunter was living in New Bond Street, Mayfair, when an incident occurred which showed his nature. A servant of his had stolen and pawned a silver ladle and other goods and was found guilty at the Old Bailey. Her defence was \\"Mr. Gunter has been a worthy master to me, I hope he will be favourable; he always behaved well to me\\" resulted in her receiving a fine of one shilling and six months in the House of Correction, while others convicted of similar crimes were sentenced to seven years transportation.Old Bailey on-line Gunter decided to develop his own farms and market gardens to grow fruit and first became involved in the Earl's Court area - then a prime market garden area in the parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington - when he took a sub-lease of part of Home Field and Great Court Field from a local farmer in 1797. He bought the freehold of these properties in 1799. He also bought Earls Court Lodge which became the Gunters‚Äô family home for 60 years. By 1799 he had also become sole proprietor of Gunter's Tea Shop which became one of the most fashionable Mayfair meeting places. Earls Court Lodge became nicknamed \\"Currant-Jelly Hall\\". In 1805 Gunter purchased some land where Coleherne Road and Redcliffe Square are now situated. By 1807 Gunter had also bought from speculative builder Thomas Smith some land in Great Court Field and the Home Field land. He also bought a large plot from William Boulton where in 1850 his son Robert I Gunter commenced the building of The Boltons, an exclusive residential area still in existence. He was unsuccessful in his bid to buy some land that would have connected his other plots to The Boltons area but carried on acquiring land on a piecemeal basis with more land at Redcliffe Square and the Boltons and in 1812 bought land between the Boltons and Fulham Road. He started building villas on his property between 1808 and 1810 around Earls Court Road and Old Brompton Road, although these were subsequently demolished in later developments.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Since 2019 the building has housed a senior living apartment building. History The building before it was renovated into apartments. Buchanan School was built as School #14 in 1904 when J. B. Young was superintendent. It was one of eight elementary schools that were opened during his 30-year administration. with Its name was changed to Buchanan four years after it opened. When the \\"6-3-3\\" system was adopted by Davenport schools around 1919 Buchanan continued serving its west end neighborhood as an elementary school. It continued in that capacity until 1940. The building sat vacant until 1951 when it was converted for use as a U.S. Naval Training Center. They continued to use the building until 1978 when it sat vacant again. In 1988 it was used for storage for an antique auto parts business. The building has subsequently been vacated again and has deteriorated. In 2014 a proposal was announced to convert the former school building into 18 senior apartments, but funding fell through. By the time financing was secured the building was in a serious state of decline. The roof and the west wall, which were caving in, had to be stabilized. In the renovation process, all of the exterior's original decorative features were kept and repaired. The red clay roof tiles, bricks, and stonework that had deteriorated were replaced. On the interior, the original central staircase, classroom doors, and the open areas in the center of the second and third floors were all retained. The nearly $9 million renovation project, which was about twice the original estimate in 2014, was completed in the summer of 2019. The building, now known as The Naval Station, houses 18 senior living apartments with six units on each floor. Architecture The school building was designed by the Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Burrows. It sits on a full city block that is irregularly shaped by the intersection of the city street grid and Telegraph Road that follows the lower line of the river bluffs at this point. The building's design combines the Colonial Revival and Renaissance Revival styles. The rectangular structure is two stories high on a raised basement. It is built entirely with yellow bricks, however, the bricks on the lower level are laid in such a way as to suggest stone. The building features a hipped roof with bracketed eaves. The south elevation of the building has two entrances framed by round arches. The building has three different window styles. There are segmented windows on the basement level, rectangular windows on the main floor, and round arch windows on the second floor.

His distinctive style is deeply influenced by classic animation, underground comics, skateboarding and 1980‚Ä≤s video games. Over the years, Ledbetter has created an incredible cast of creatures used to anthropomorphize the human condition. With crisp bold lines and a vibrant palette, he mixes irony, social criticism and mischief making his work universal and unmistakable. He earned a degree in Sociology from Humboldt State University in 2001, and despite his lack of formal art training, began his career as a graphic artist in the apparel industry. Working his way up from underground art shows, he‚Äôs been at his craft full-time since 2004 holding art exhibitions in over 10 countries, collaborating with top brands (Nike, Swatch, Sony Music, Kidrobot), exhibiting in museum shows (Andy Warhol Museum, MADRE Museum Italy, Bristol City Museum, Riverside Art Museum), sold work at Christie‚Äôs auction house in New York, and has been featured in The Los Angeles Times, People Magazine, Juxtapoz Magazine and Hi-Fructose Magazine.

Wobogu was originally called Boukary Koutou, but dropped those names on his accession and assumed the name \\"Wobogu\\", meaning elephant. Years of independence Ouagadougou was the main Mossi Kingdom in what is now Burkina Faso, with its origins in the 15th century. The Mossi were a warlike nation with formidable cavalry, who had successfully resisted all past invaders. With the decline of the central state in the 18th century, Yatenga, with its capital at Ouahigouya, had become independent of Ouagadougou, as had other places. During the 19th century there was sporadic warfare among the Mossi. Boukary Koutou's father, ruler of Ouagadougou, died in 1850 when Boukary was a young man. Boukary competed unsuccessfully with his brother Sanum to become ruler but was disallowed due to his youth. After fomenting a civil war against his brother, he was exiled to Banema on the border of the kingdom. There he made a living through slave trading, capturing the slaves in mounted razzias directed at the villages of the Gurunsi people. When Sanum died in 1890, he left no male heir, and all his brothers were in competition for the throne. The elders were reluctant to make Boukary the Mogho Naba, since his rebellion had made him ineligible, but were persuaded when he surrounded their meeting place with soldiers. Although now the principal Mossi ruler, Wobogo was not in full control. At the time of Dr. Francois Crozat's visit in September 1890, the Yako and Yatenga people were engaged in civil war. Wobogo attempted to halt the fighting to avoid giving a poor impression to his European visitor, but was not successful. Character The French explorer Louis Gustave Binger visited the Mossi in 1888. He described Boukary Koutou, whom he found in exile at Bassawarga, as a tall and handsome man in his forties, neatly dressed, with a round face decorated with tattoos and a small goatee. He said of the future ruler \\"His whole appearance denotes intelligence. He seems to be a just man, but firm in his resolutions\\". Binger saw a resemblance to Iamory Ouattara, ruler of the Kong state of Knniara, but said Boukary had much finer features. However, Crozat was not impressed by Wobogo upon meeting him in 1890. He described him in his reports as \\"timid, shaky\\" and living \\"confined to his palace with his servants and wives, not daring to go out\\". Crozat reported that Wobogo \\"spent his time consulting holy men who had him under their control and who used up the resources of the realm to contrive the oddest and most expensive charms in order to allay the ruler's fear that he would be assassinated\\". Crozat reported that Wobogo had a hundred wives, although he did not see this many when he visited since many lived in neighboring villages. Defeat and exile Wobogo ruled at a time when the French and British were taking control of the region, and intensely distrusted both. When the French explorer Parfait-Louis Monteil visited Ouagadougou in 1891, hoping Wobogo would agree to a French protectorate, Wogobo refused to receive him. Monteil was forced to make a hurried departure. In 1894, Wobogo signed a treaty of friendship with George Ekem Ferguson, a Fante representative of the British in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). In 1896, the French invaded Ouagadougou, and when he attempted to resist his town was burned down. The French commander Voulet deposed Wobogo in 1897, replacing him with his brother Sighiri. Wobogo appealed to the British without success. After further fighting, he fled to Zongoiri just across the border in the northeast of the Gold Coast, where he died in 1904.

It is a designated a National Historic Site of Canada, as well as a Provincially Registered Property under the provincial Heritage Property Act. It is located within the Old Town Lunenburg World Heritage Site. The Knaut‚ÄìRhuland House is owned by the Lunenburg Heritage Society, which operates a museum in the house open to the public during the summer. History The house is named for its first two owners. The first owner, Benjamin Knaut, had the house built in 1793. Benjamin was one of the town‚Äôs first sheriffs, a trader and a privateer. The second owner, Conrad Rhuland, was also a trader and ship owner and during the War of 1812 was a privateer‚Äôs prize master. Description The houses' design is British Classicism. The entrance door is framed by sidelights and there is a transom window overhead. All windows are multi - paned six over six and many have the original old glass. The foundation is stone, more than two feet thick, and is built around two chimneys. The frame is post and beam, consisting of hand-hewn timbers. These are \\"numbered\\" with hatch marks suggesting that it was prepared off-site. The interior walls and ceilings were plastered (reinforced with horse hair) and applied to split lath. The floors are pine and there are seven fireplaces. There are original mouldings and wood work in some rooms. There are furnished rooms on the ground floor providing examples of the style of furnishings that would be known to the first two owners. An exhibition called \\"Our Spiritual Heritage\\" contains a display of old Bibles and prayer books, some dating from the time of the \\"Foreign Protestants\\" who came to Lunenburg in 1753. This exhibition contains display panels describing Lunenburg‚Äôs churches, which are amongst the oldest in Canada. There is also a room depicting the craft activities of the 18th and 19th centuries, with among other items a walking wheel, spinning wheels and wool winders.

It is increasingly grown as an ornamental tree in African gardens. Appearance This tree has lush, glossy, bright-green foliage on arching and drooping branches. It is often multi-stemmed and can eventually reach a height of over 15m. The way that the dense foliage droops from the hanging branches gives the tree a willowy appearance. Notsung is unusual in producing its flowers and fruit, not from the tips of its branches like most flowering trees, but from its trunk, exhibiting what is known in botany as cauliflory. This characteristic is also found in other Southern African trees such as Stamvrug. The orange or purple flowers are rich in nectar and bi-sexual. The small, fleshy fruits are edible (but do not taste particularly good). It is a member of the Snapdragon family. Distribution The natural range of this tree extends throughout South Africa, as well as northwards through East Africa as far as Ethiopia. Its natural habitats include deep afro-montane forest, forest fringes, open mountain slopes, gorges and river banks. Like many other trees, in a shady habitat (like deep forest) Halleria lucida grows tall and slender; while it forms a smaller shrub-like tree if grown in the open. Growing Halleria lucida On Table Mountain Tough and easy to grow, Halleria lucida is becoming popular as an ornamental tree for gardens. It is undoubtedly one of the best trees in Africa for attracting birds, but it is usually grown more for its attractive foliage and flowers. It tolerates full sun as well as partial shade and, once established, it can also survive moderate drought. This makes it particularly suitable for growing in mildly arid areas. It is also a relatively fast-growing tree. This is an excellent tree for bringing birds to the garden. Nectivorous birds such as sunbirds are attracted to the bright flowers, and the fruits attract a large range of other birds. The leaves and fruits of Halleria lucida are an important component of traditional African medicine. In addition, it has a function in traditional Zulu religion, as the ceremonial burning of the leaves is believed to counter witchcraft and summon the protective spirits of dead ancestors.

He is the founder and managing partner of the investment firm Thrive Capital, co-founder of Oscar Health, and the son of real estate magnate Charles Kushner. His brother is Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and senior advisor of U.S. President Donald Trump. Early life Kushner grew up in a Jewish family in Livingston, New Jersey. He graduated from Harvard College in 2008, and Harvard Business School in 2011. Career= Early career  During his sophomore year, Kushner was founding executive editor of Scene, a new Brooks Brothers-sponsored student-publication that aimed to be \\"Harvard's version of Vogue and Vanity Fair\\". According to The Harvard Crimson, Scene \\"faced blistering criticism upon its release\\", with students going so far as creating a \\"Scene Magazine is Bullshit\\" Facebook group criticizing it for its \\"completely ludicrous ... skewed portrayal of the Harvard community\\" and \\"lack of models who were minorities\\". In the spring of his junior year, with two graduate students he pooled $10,000 to found social network Vostu, which aimed to \\"fill a void left by online communities in which English is the lingua franca\\", like Facebook. According to Kushner, Latin America was a promising market for a Facebook-alternative and new social networking site because \\"[it was] a place where Internet use is increasing every year, and technology is booming at a rapid pace\\". The year after graduation, he also co-founded a start-up called Unithrive, with the cousin of the president of Kiva who was also a Harvard student. Unithrive was inspired by the peer-to-peer loan model of Kiva, but aimed to \\"ease the crisis in paying for college\\" by matching \\"alumni lenders to cash-strapped students ... who [could] post photographs and biographical information and request up to $2,000\\", interest-free for repayment within five years of graduation. After graduating from Harvard, he started his career in the Private Equity Group at Goldman Sachs, in the Merchant Banking Division, but left after a short stint. Thrive Capital He founded Thrive Capital in 2009, his private equity and venture capital firm that focuses on media and internet investments. Since its founding, Thrive has raised $750 million from institutional investors, including Princeton University. Thrive has raised several capital funds, including Thrive II, which raised $40 million in 2011, Thrive III, which raised $150 million in 2012, and Thrive IV, which raised $400 million in September 2014. As an investor in Instagram, Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round. Valued at $500 million, Thrive soon doubled its money after Instagram was sold to Facebook. For his work with Thrive, Kushner was named to Forbes 30 Under 30, Inc. Magazine's 35 Under 35, Crain's 40 Under 40, and Vanity Fair's Next Establishment. Oscar Kushner is a co-founder of Oscar Health, a health insurance start-up. Founded in 2012, Oscar was valued at $2.7 billion in 2016. As of 2015, the company insured over 145,000 members across four states, and has been named to CNBC's Disruptor 50, Inc. Magazine's Most Innovative Start-Ups, and MM&M; Top 40 Health Care Transformers. Cadre In 2015, Kushner founded a new company called Cadre with his brother Jared and their friend Ryan Williams, with Williams as Cadre's CEO. Cadre is a technology platform designed to help certain types of client, such as family offices and endowments, invest in real estate. Personal life Kushner started dating model Karlie Kloss in 2012.

It is situated to the west of the Hindsford Brook, an ancient boundary between the townships of Atherton and Tyldesley cum Shakerley, and east of the Chanters Brook in the ancient parish of Leigh. History Historically in Lancashire, Hindsford developed in the middle of the 19th century when large cotton mills were built on both sides of the Hindsford Brook in Hindsford and Tyldesley by James Burton and Sons. Rows of terraced housing were built for the influx of workers, many from Ireland. Field Mill, Lodge Mill and Westfield Mill were on the Hindsford bank. Lodge Mill and Westfield Mill closed in the 1920s but the site of Atherton Mill was used by Ward and Goldstone who made electrical items. The Fletchers owned a coal mine at Chanters Colliery from the 1850s but coal had been mined in that area for centuries. The company became Fletcher, Burrows and Company in 1874 and in 1875 the company who owned Atherton Collieries employed a Dutch architect to design cottages for the workers in the coal mines. The colliery had access to a dozen seams including the Arley mine at 1,832 feet, it closed in 1966. There was a brickworks at Swan Island. Religion Many Roman Catholics from Ireland came to work in the mills and collieries of Atherton and Tyldesley. One was John Holland of the Tyldesley Coal Company who provided the materials to build Sacred Heart Church on land donated by Lord Lilford. The church was consecrated by Bishop Goss of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool in 1869. The parish church in Atherton built a mission church at Swan Island in 1873. Hindsford became an independent parish in 1884 and in 1889 the foundation stone for St Anne's Church was laid. The church was completed in 1901 and cost ¬£9,000.

The film is adapted for the screen, by Adrian Alington, from his own, topical novel These Our Strangers, dealing with the experiences of a group of wartime evacuee children from London, sent to safety in a rural village, and their interaction with the host community. Of the juvenile actors involved, Fowler (making his screen debut here aged 15) and Cole (then 16) would go on to very successful adult careers, while Angela Glynne and Stanley Escane had more modest careers for the next decade or so. Synopsis On the outbreak of the Second World War, a group of six children from the East End of London are evacuated to the village of Payling Green. The boisterous pair Charlie and Ern are lodged with the local vicar and proceed to torment, mock and terrorise his sensitive and delicate son. They then get involved in petty-thieving and vandalism, before being taken under the protective wing of a local female novelist with progressive social views. Sisters Liz and Maud are placed with a pair of old-fashioned and stern spinster sisters and chafe under the constrictions of the discipline imposed on them. They become increasingly unhappy until they are taken in by the local Earl, who discovers Liz's singing talent and proposes to sponsor her to train professionally. Liz's parents are called to visit and her father at first bridles at the interference of a member of the gentry in his daughter's life, before being brought round to the view that her talent should be nurtured.

Contemporary reviews commended the film for exploring a timely subject which had not previously been tackled on screen, and gave it a generally sympathetic reception. However comments suggest that rather than aiming for a documentary- realism feel, Comfort fell back on an uneasy mixture of obvious pathos and broad comedy. Kine Weekly said it had \\"some good moments and a certain amount of child psychology, but it hardly presents a good case for evacuation\\". The Daily Film Renter labelled it \\"commendable popular entertainment\\", while Cinema praised \\"sympathetic direction...(which) cleverly sets wartime atmosphere and..a convincing picture of reactions of parents, children and hosts\\", but felt the film faltered badly in its later stages by \\"resorting to frank slapstick\\". Another trade reviewer complimented the film as a whole, but felt that it \\"made no attempt to solve the problems with any profound searchings\\" and its overall tone was \\"more burlesque than life\\".British Film Makers: Lance Comfort, McFarlane, Brian.

His former teacher Heusler wrote repeatedly to his friend Wilhelm Ranisch that he seemed \\"no longer entirely sane\\" and that he seemed to have developed \\"an unhealthy ambition, not to say megalomania\\".Klaus D√ºwel and Heinrich Beck, ed., Andreas Heusler an Wilhelm Ranisch: Briefe aus den Jahren 1890-1940, Basel: Helbing & Lichtenhahn, 1989, , cited in Fritz Paul: nicht mehr im vollen Besitz seiner Geisteskr√§fte; krankhaften Ehrgeiz, um nicht zu sagen: Gr√∂√üenwahn. According to Mees, pp. 175-76, Heusler \\"had come to the conclusion by 1933 that Neckel had simply gone mad\\". Neckel's research focused on early Germanic studies and Old Norse. He published the standard German edition of the Elder Edda. Continuing the approach of Jacob Grimm and of Heusler, he saw all Germanic sources, regardless of period or geographic location, as contributing to the picture of a unified Germanic culture.Reallexikon pp. 47-48, quoting: Die germanische Gesellschaft von F√ºrsten, Bauern und Sklaven, die wir aus den Sagas so genau kennenlernen [...], sie ist die germanische Gesellschaft der Zeit Attilas, der Zeit des Arminius und schon fr√ºherer Zeiten, die √ºberall wesentlich dasselbe Gesicht zeigte. - \\"The Germanic society of lords, farmers and slaves which we come to know so well from the sagas . . . , that is the Germanic society of the time of Attila, the time of Arminius and even earlier times, which everywhere evinced essentially the same features\\". This culture he believed ethically superior to the medieval Christianity which overtook it, particularly in its respect for women. Heusler and others have considered conflict between ideologues within the Nazi regime, specifically between the Amt Rosenberg, the Ministry and the Ahnenerbe, at least partly to blame for his banishment to G√∂ttingen.Zernack, \\"'Wenn es sein mu√ü, mit H√§rte'\\", p. 178.

It is notable for pioneering the use of mouse-controlled aiming in a first-person shooter. Synopsis The storyline for CyClones is set in the closing of the 20th century, when wars and pollution devastated many countries in the world and led to a policy of isolation for many governments. During this period, episodes of mass hysteria became widespread, and reports of increased UFO sightings and abductions abounded. A number of \\"E.T. Phobics\\" joined to create the Advanced Ideas Corporation (A.I.). Partially funded by the U.S. military, the corporation began operating in secret laboratories as the millennium came to a close. The Corporation was eventually able to discover and examine a downed alien ship, confirming suspicions of alien activity on the planet. Jubilation over the discovery was short-lived, however, as three days later, the aliens attacked. The attack began with surgical strikes against earth's satellite and missile- control centers. A remarkable discovery about the alien invasion was that most of the invaders were cloned from human tissuesamples, genetically engineered, and then cybernetically enhanced. These humanoids were then dubbed \\"CyClones\\" at the time the aliens attacked, A.I. had begun work a prototype of a weapon it dubbed the \\"HAVOC Unit\\". Built by combining human technology and alien technology recovered from the alien ship, the HAVOC project resulted in the production of a cybernetically-enhanced fighter with superior combat capabilities, which the U.S. government intended to use to sabotage the main alien operations and locate the main base of operations for the aliens, in order to destroy their leader and cause enough disarray in the enemy forces to allow for their defeat by conventional armies. Gameplay The player controls the \\"HAVOC unit\\" in a series of missions given by the Earth government to confront and push back the alien invaders and their clone servants. The gameplay follows the standard first-person shooter formula set by Doom the year before, requiring the player to navigate several levels while fighting enemies and activating switches or seeking keys to gain access to different areas. Several missions have specific objectives that must be met before the player is allowed to continue and instructions on what to do next may be displayed on-screen when the player enters a certain area. The enemies encountered include the CyClones humanoids, as well as several robotic and alien creatures. Some enemies are stationary, such as floor or ceiling turrets, and hazards such as explosive barrels are also included. The player can find medikits and \\"mech-kits\\" (which serve as armor) in order to ensure their survivability, as well as acquire several weapons which are either human or alien in origin. Later in the game it is possible to acquire an alien suit which grants access to even more powerful weapons, as well as a jetpack that allows the player to fly around the stage. The most remarkable aspect of CyClones' gameplay is the aiming system. Unlike Doom and most other first person shooter games of the era, CyClones implemented a mouse aiming system, featuring a movable aiming reticle, and allowed players to look up and down, and to jump. The aiming system allows the player to fire their weapon at whatever position they point at in the screen, allowing for significant more accuracy than what the vertical autoaim system employed by most other shooters allowed for. Also unlike Doom, items are picked up not by walking over them but by clicking on them with the mouse. In addition, it is possible to use the mouse to operate the HUD on the screen, in order to for example use an inventory item, switch to another weapon or access the map screen. This control system is very similar (but somewhat less clumsy) than what was later used by the game System Shock. Development Development for CyClones started in early 1994, when Raven Software's developers split in two teams: one working with id software's Doom engine to create a fantasy game which later evolved into Heretic, while the other team started on a project that was to use the engine from ShadowCaster to create a futuristic first-person shooter game for Strategic Simulations. However, the ShadowCaster engine had by then become dated, especially when compared to Doom, and so Raven produced a new in-house engine, developed mainly by Carl Stika. The engine was nicknamed \\"Steam\\" and offered significant improvements over the Wolfenstein 3D-derived ShadowCaster engine, such as moving platforms, catwalks, sloped floors, and transparent textures. However, the engine was still limited to 90-degree wall geometry, akin to Rise of the Triad and some other shooters of the period. The game was originally released on floppy disks, featuring a MIDI soundtrack, but was later re-released on a CD in \\"multimedia enhanced\\" edition, featuring redbook audio soundtrack and a full motion video (FMV) cutscene that introduces the game and its story.

The Diploma Plus model has been implemented in five geographical regions across the United States. History Diploma Plus was developed by Commonwealth Corporation in 1996 as a response to the alarmingly high drop out rate and barriers to post-secondary success for urban youth of color, and the inadequate supply of high quality alternatives to traditional high schools. In 2003, Diploma Plus became part of the Association for High School Innovation, formerly the Alternative High School Initiative. Since its launch in 1996, Diploma Plus has grown from a 100-student pilot at two sites in Boston, MA to an organization that, in 2009‚Äì10, enrolls over 3,400 students at 29 alternative high schools across the country. Operating model Each Diploma Plus school is required to implement Four Essential components: #A performance based system that includes competency-based assessment and performance-based promotion #A supportive school culture that intentionally creates positive relationships among students, staff and parents/families #A Future Focus that provides post-secondary education preparation, career preparation and civic engagement opportunities #Effective internal and external capabilities to successfully implement the DP model.Diploma Plus (2009) \\"The Diploma Plus Paths to Success \\". Accessed October 2010 Diploma Plus schools are generally much smaller in size and generally serve students who are beginning to age out of the traditional school system. Rather than grade levels, Diploma Plus students are placed into and promoted through three phases: foundation, presentation and plus. In each phase, students learn content and skills at an appropriate level, regardless of their age or previous credit accumulation.Steiny, Julia; \\"Diploma Plus approach specializes in educating dropouts\\", The Providence Journal, February 14, 2010. Accessed October 2010 Most sites in the Diploma Plus Network offer a three- to four- year program or study, and are either small, alternative high schools run by districts or are charter schools. Other Diploma Plus sites are district- supported alternative programs or programs implemented by community colleges in partnership with local school districts that serve students for shorter periods of time. Diploma Plus schools have the autonomy to uniquely design experiences that work for its student population's specific needs. An American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research report on the use of innovation in schools highlights this characteristic saying, \\"this means changing schedules, allowing for early-release time for working students, and using different kinds of teachers--all of which run up against traditional state and district rules\\".Hess, Frederick; \\"The Transformative Promise of \\"Greenfield\\" Schooling Removing Barriers to Innovation Is the First Step in Creating an Environment in Which Innovation Can Flourish\\", American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. February 1, 2010. Accessed October 2010 Educational impact More than 83% of DP students are African American or Latino/Hispanic; more than 74% are eligible for the federally subsidized meal program. Students are accepted regardless of prior academic record, conduct, or socioeconomic background. When compared to schools with a similar student population, Diploma Plus schools tend to have higher attendance rates, retention rates and passing rates on state tests. According to Vicki L.

History  In 2010, the WFMT celebrated its 25th anniversary. The seeds for the development of the World Federation of Music Therapy were sown during the second World Congress of Music Therapy in Buenos Aires in 1976. A group of American, European, and South American music therapists met and started to develop a plan for unity and standards in the international arena of music therapy. Among the ten founding members were Rolando Benenzon (Argentina), Giovanna Mutti (Italy), Jacques Jost (France), Barbara Hesser (USA), Amelia Oldfield (UK), Ruth Bright (Australia), Heinrich Otto Moll (Germany), Rafael Colon (Puerto Rico), Clementina Nastari (Brazil), and Tadeusz Natanson (Poland).

Outside forests they are also commonly encountered along stream banks and in gullies. Distribution Fully grown Rapanea melanophloeos in native afro-temperate forest near Cape Town. The natural range of this stately tree is from Cape Town in the south, to Zambia in the north. In the Eastern Cape it is sometimes found alongside its smaller coastal relative, Rapanea gilliana. Despite its common name it is not a close relative of the familiar Beech tree of the northern hemisphere, and it is actually more closely related to the Rhododendrons. Description Rapanea melanophloeos is a dense, graceful, evergreen tree. Its leaves, stalks and berries often have a purple or maroon color. This tree is usually dioecious (male and female flowers on different trees) and birds are attracted by its tiny, dark purple berries. The specific name 'melanophloeos' means 'black bark' and resulted from a mistaken identification of the source tree as Swartbas (Diospyros whyteana). Cultivation Rapanea melanophloeos tree in Harold Porter National Botanical Garden. Rapanea melanophloeos is cultivated as an ornamental tree and screening shrub in gardens, and as a potted bonsai specimen. It is hardy and grows well in windy areas and near the coast. Once established, the plant is reasonably drought tolerant and has low maintenance needs. The plant sends up suckers from its roots that eventually become new trees, and so is best not planted adjacent to paving. Rapanea grows easily from seed.

Historically within Lancashire, it is situated to the south west of Atherton town centre on the B5215, the old turnpike road from Bolton to Leigh. The settlement was built as a model pit village by the owners of Atherton Collieries. History John Fletcher of Bolton, a member of a family with mining interests, came to Atherton in 1768 to sink two shafts. Ralph Fletcher was part-owner in the Ladyshore Colliery. The pits developed and Fletcher, Burrows and Company's Atherton Collieries was formed in 1870, owning all the coalmines in the town. Howe Bridge Colliery employed 460 men in 1954. In 1908 the Howe Bridge Mines Rescue Station opened on Lovers Lane. It was the first mines rescue station in Lancashire. Transport The station at Howe Bridge was originally named Chowbent and, in common with other stations on the Manchester to Wigan Line, was opened by the London and North Western Railway on 1 September 1864. South Lancashire Tramways built a tram shed, power station and offices in 1901 on the north side of Leigh Road. It was taken over by Lancashire United Transport who built a bus depot on the south side Leigh Road on the site of the closed Howe Bridge Colliery pithead. Religion A school and mission opened at Howe Bridge in the Atherton parish in 1869. St Michael and All Angels Church was built in 1877 as a result of the late Victorian urbanisation which occurred when the small settlement on the road from Atherton to Leigh became a pit village when deep mining began at Howe Bridge Colliery. The church was designed by Paley and Austin of Lancaster, and the ¬£7,000 cost was given by John Fletcher. Landmarks Between 1873 and 1875, Fletcher, Burrows and Company, owners of the local collieries, built a model village on Leigh Road, comprising terraced cottages, shops, Atherton Collieries Village Club and a bath house for their employees. This Victorian village on either side of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area.

The former grade school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 2005. History The building was built from 1897 to 1898 as School #11 when J. B. Young was superintendent. By 1898 the Davenport school district had twelve school buildings and a new school was being added every year. The district served more than 5,800 students with a staff of 142 teachers. with The name of the building was changed to Taylor School in 1908. The \\"6-3-3\\" system was adopted for Davenport Schools in 1919 and Taylor continued to serve its central Davenport neighborhood as an elementary school. It later served as a school for students with intellectual disabilities in the district before it closed. The building had sat empty for most of the 1990s and 2000s. A renovation process to convert the building into senior housing began in 2005. The plan included building an addition as well as renovating the old school building. Financial problems plagued an earlier attempt to develop the project. Construction began again on the project in May, 2010 by the Renaissance Realty Group of Chicago and the $11 million renovation was completed in June, 2011. The building is now known as The Taylor Renaissance, and features forty-one rental units for people 55 and above. Architecture The Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Burrows designed the building in the Colonial Revival style. The square block building is two stories high on a raised basement. It is built with red bricks and the basement is faced with large blocks of dressed limestone. The building features a hipped roof with bracketed eaves. The windows in the building are grouped in round-arched arcades. The arched main entrance is covered by a simple canopy with columns in the simplified Doric order.

It was declared redundant on 29 December 1975, and was vested in the Trust on 26 July 1979. The church has Norman origins, belonging to Amesbury Priory in 1179, with the earliest parts of the existing building dating from the late 12th and early 13th century, however there have been several alterations since, including the renewal of the roof of the nave in 1603 funded by Giles Tooker. Sir Stephen Fox became the lord of the manor in the late 17th century and paid for the rebuilding of the chancel and redecoration. A gallery was added in 1637 but has since been removed. In 1853 the chancel was rebuilt and the whole church restored by Thomas Henry Wyatt, including the erection of the gabled porch. The walls of the nave and chancel have a chequerboard pattern of flint and sandstone.

The four walls of a movie theater give the term its name. Companies engaging in this practice were common in the United States during the late 1960s and 1970s; one of them was the Utah-based Sunn Classic Pictures.  Overview  Four wall distribution is termed after the four walls of a movie theater. In this process, a film company spends at least one or two weekends renting a movie theater from the facility's owner (for a flat fee), and paying for every seat. The company receives all of the box office revenue, while the theater keeps sales from popcorn and concessions. By contrast, ticket sales are shared between theaters and distributors on normal releases. Use of the four-wall technique has been generally uncommon, except during the late 1960s and 1970s when a host of U.S. companies engaged in this method. They tended to operate in states such as Utah, Oregon, Florida and Texas, but this practice was not utilized in major markets like New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. An early entrant in this field was American National Enterprises (ANE), which was set up in 1965 by three Utah residents--Russel Niehart, Robert Crosier and Frank Olson. One of the distributor's first releases was Alaskan Safari, a 1968 nature documentary whose viewership exceeded over 5.5 million patrons over a five-year run. Rayland Jensen handled distribution of the film; in 1971, at the request of employees from the Schick razor company, he and other ANE members established their own outlet, Sunn Classic Pictures. Like its predecessor, Sunn also specialized in four-walled releases, among them a 1973 re-issue of Chariots of the Gods; 1974's The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams; 1976's In Search of Noah's Ark; and 1977's The Lincoln Conspiracy. In addition to Sunn, various other companies like Doty-Dayton of Utah and Pacific International Enterprises of Oregon practised four-wall engagements. The process was also used by animation company Filmation for its 1974 release of Journey Back to Oz, via a partnership with Seymour Borde. Also in 1974, the Walter Reade Theater in New York City held a four-wall run of Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones, a concert film from Dragonaire Inc. Filmmaker Tom Laughlin used the four-wall technique for his film, Billy Jack, after accusing its distributor Warner Bros. for improperly handling the movie. As recently as the 1990s and 2000s, examples of four-walled releases included the films of Warren Miller; 1992's Brother's Keeper, by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky; and the annual short- subject anthology Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation. Filmmaker Joe Camp expressed concern over the four-wall movement and told Variety magazine in 1977: \\"It has become an industry-caused thing, but the G rated classification has to some degree become 'if it's G, it can't be for me'.\\" Camp observed that four-wall companies had saturated the market for G-rated product; in response to the lowered-down quality of their films, he created the 1974 family film Benji. Four wall distribution has copyright implications; a film distributed through four wall distribution, and no other method, may classify as an unpublished work. Because of this, Deep Throat, a pornographic film distributed exclusively through four-wall distribution during its theatrical release, did not officially become published until it was released on home video over a decade later; had the film been distributed traditionally, it would have immediately lapsed into the public domain for lack of a copyright notice (such a notice has been included on all home video releases).

Consumer website orders are shipped in insulated boxes by overnight courier. History  D'Artagnan was founded in 1985 by Ariane Daguin and George Faison. Their partnership was formed while working together at a charcuterie shop in New York City. There they met a farmer with the first domestically-raised foie gras in the United States. He was looking for distribution for his product, which the charcuterie shop declined. Daguin and Faison founded D‚ÄôArtagnan to distribute it themselves.\\"The duck stops for D'Artagnan's Ariane Daguin\\" (February 17, 2010) The Star-Ledger D‚ÄôArtagnan originally sold whole lobes of raw foie gras to the chefs of New York City. At the time the only foie gras available to restaurants was canned product imported from Europe. D‚ÄôArtagnan's product line quickly expanded to include game meats and heritage breed poultry, organic chicken, heritage turkey, grass-fed beef, humanely-raised veal and pork, pheasant, quail, squab and prepared products like p√¢t√©, dry-cured sausages, smoked duck breast and duck prosciutto. D‚ÄôArtagnan was an early proponent of humanely raised, antibiotic and hormone-free organic meat. The company sources from small farmers and creates cooperatives of farms where possible, to ensure that animals are raised in humane conditions. They procure meats from small family farms that are committed to humane, sustainable free-range, antibiotic and hormone free methods of animal husbandry.

Edible Manhattan, No. 6 July/August 2009 D‚ÄôArtagnan's line of products became more available to the consumer public when it began selling items to major grocery stores Balducci's and the Food Emporium in 1996. \\"There is no reason you should be brutal to animals when you don't have to,\\" Daguin was reported saying, \\"This is the first time ever I saw pigs being killed and not shrieking, because they didn't realize it.\\" In February 2002, D‚ÄôArtagnan opened a restaurant and retail shop, D‚ÄôArtagnan the Rotisserie, which served Gascon specialties, including foie gras burgers, cassoulet, duck confit, Armagnac, and the wines of the Southwest region of France. A retail area sold D‚ÄôArtagnan prepared products such as p√¢t√©s and terrines. William Grimes reviewed D‚ÄôArtagnan the Rotisserie in The New York Times, and gave the restaurant two stars, saying: \\"D‚ÄôArtagnan has the real thing.

Function  Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation, such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes, beta II and beta III. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells, whereas in basophils, alpha-tryptases predominate.

The novel won the Man Booker Prize. Plot synopsis Julian Treslove, a professionally unspectacular former BBC radio producer, and Sam Finkler, a popular Jewish philosopher, writer and television personality, are old school friends. Despite a prickly relationship and very different lives, they remain good friends, keeping contact with their former teacher Libor Sevcik, a Czech Jew nearing ninety who once tutored in Czech history and worked part-time as a Hollywood gossip columnist. Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and Treslove's chequered and unsuccessful record with women qualify him as an honorary third widower. They dine together at Libor's grand apartment in central London: it is a sweetly painful evening of reminiscences. At 11:30 pm that night, Treslove is attacked while walking home. It seems he is mugged by a woman who hisses the phrase \\"You Ju\\" at him. After much cogitation, Treslove believes what the assailant meant was \\"You, Jew\\", sparking a long-running obsession with all things and people Jewish ‚Äì which he refers to as \\"Finkler\\". Treslove gets into a relationship with Hephzibah, the great-grandniece of Libor, and is haunted by his adulterous affair with Tyler, Finkler's deceased wife. In the meantime, Finkler joins an \\"ASHamed\\" organization which favours the Palestinians over the Israelis over their land disputes. The novel coalesces into an ending that brings together the disparate narrative strands amongst the three central male characters. Critical response Chairman of the judges and former Poet Laureate Andrew Motion said, \\"The Finkler Question should not be seen as something that was 'relentlessly middle-brow, or easy-peasy' because it was comic. It is much cleverer and more complicated and about much more difficult things than it immediately lets you know.

He was married to Johanna Magdalene of Saxe- Weissenfels in 1730.  Early life  Jacob Kettler was Ferdinand Kettler's father and Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg was the subject's mother. He was introduced to this world on November 1, 1655, in Jelgava, Latvia. Therefore, he is Latvian. He and his family were held captive by the Swedes in Riga. They were moved to Ivangorod, then part of Swedish Ingermanland, and held there between 1658 and 1660 (a total of two years). After the death of his father, Jacob Kettler, in 1682, the duchy passed to Ferdinand's older brother, Frederick Casimir Kettler. Frederick was in the Polish army, where he reached the rank of Lieutenant-General and participated in many battles against the Ottoman Empire. After Frederick's death in 1698, his widow and Ferdinand became guardians of the minor heir, Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler, and ruled the duchy in his name.  Later life  When the Great Northern War started in 1700, Ferdinand fought in battles near Riga. After his defeat in the Battle of Daugava, he fled to Danzig, where he stayed until his death. The council of the duchy (Landtag) under Swedish occupation refused to recognize Ferdinand as duke. Meanwhile, Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler had married Anna of Russia. When Friedrich Wilhelm died, he left Ferdinand as the last heir to the throne of Courland from the House of Kettler. However, Ferdinand was reluctant to return, and the duchy was instead ruled by Anna of Russia, who acted as regent. In 1725, the Council of the Duchy elected Maurice de Saxe as the new duke. However, he soon left Courland because of friction with the Russian imperial administration. In 1730, Ferdinand, then 75 years old, married young Johanna Magdalene of Saxe-Weissenfels. That same year, Anna of Russia became tsarina of the Russian Empire. The Council of the Duchy finally recognized Ferdinand as duke. However, in 1736, the King of Poland, August III, in a private meeting, offered the throne of Courland to Ernst Johann von Biron. Biron was Anna's lover and had great influence on state affairs. Ferdinand died in Danzig, Poland, on May 4, 1737. He had no children. A month later, the Council of the Duchy elected Ernst Johann von Biron as the new Duke of Courland and Semigallia.

Function  Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. There is uncertainty regarding the number of genes in this cluster. Currently four functional genes - alpha I, beta I, beta II and gamma I - have been identified. And beta I has an allelic variant named alpha II, beta II has an allelic variant beta III, also gamma I has an allelic variant gamma II. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils, alpha-tryptases predominant.

She married the future William V, Landgrave of Hesse- Kassel in 1619 and became Landgravine upon his ascension to power in 1627. In 1637, military defeats forced her and William V into exile in East Frisia. Later that year, she became regent for their son William VI upon her husband's death. Through skillful diplomacy and military successes in the Thirty Years' War, she advanced the fortunes of Hesse-Kassel and influenced the Peace of Westphalia that brought the conflict to an end. She handed over an enlarged landgraviate to her son when she abdicated upon his majority in 1650. However, her health had deteriorated over the course of the war, and she died soon after her abdication in 1651. Early Life Amalie Elisabeth was born in 1602 to Philip Louis II, Count of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg and Countess Catharina Belgica of Nassau. Her mother was a daughter of William the Silent, making Amalie Elisabeth the niece of her contemporary Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. Through her mother's numerous siblings, Amalie Elisabeth was also related to many of the other noble houses of Europe. These included the Reformation- minded Wittelsbachs in Heidelberg, where she lived for a while with her aunt, Countess Louise Juliana of Nassau, and her husband Frederick IV, Elector Palatine. After the early death of her father in 1612, she returned to Hanau. She later stayed with her relatives in the Netherlands. In 1618, when Amalie Elisabeth was 16, the Defenestration of Prague triggered a revolt in Bohemia, beginning the conflict that would come to be known as the Thirty Years‚Äô War. At the time she was engaged to Albrecht Jan Smi≈ôick√Ω von Smi≈ôice, one of the six Bohemian nobles at the Defenestration of Prague who threw the Emperor's representative from a window. However, Albrecht Johann Smi≈ôick√Ω died later that year, before the couple could be married. There was a quarrel between Amalie Elisabeth and his heirs over his inheritance, which came to an end when the Habsburgs confiscated it in 1621. Soon after the death of Albrecht Johann Smi≈ôick√Ω, Amalie Elisabeth was engaged to William of Hesse-Kassel. This betrothal was part of a larger effort by William‚Äôs father Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, to build alliances with other anti-Habsburg states. Landgravine  Amalie Elisabeth married William of Hesse-Kassel in 1619. They had their first child, Agnes, in 1620, and would go on to have 12 children together. During the first years of their marriage, William‚Äôs father Landgrave Maurice was facing serious internal and external challenges to his authority. Many of these challenges would remain unresolved until Amalie Elisabeth became regent. In 1604, the ruling family of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Marburg had died out, and the will of its last Landgrave stipulated that its territory should be divided between Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel and Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, provided they both agreed to preserve the Lutheran faith. However, in 1603 Maurice had converted to Calvinism and he later attempted to convert his half of the Marburg inheritance to his new faith. Louis V, a devout Lutheran, thus challenged Maurice‚Äôs right to the inheritance, taking the case to the Aulic Council. Maurice had little reason to think the court would find in his favor, as Calvinism was not one of the legally recognized religions of the Empire. He began forming alliances with anti-Habsburg states, joining the Protestant Union in 1609. In 1623, the Aulic Council ruled in favor of Louis V and awarded Hesse-Darmstadt the entire inheritance and further financial reparations. In 1624 Louis V, who had established connections with the Catholic League, moved to enforce his claim, with Imperial General Tilly occupying Marburg and southern Hesse-Kassel. Landgrave Maurice tried desperately to raise a force to expel Tilly and prevent the annexation, but he was opposed from within Hesse-Kassel by the Landgraviate‚Äôs estates, composed of representatives from the local towns and nobility. No new taxes could be levied without the approval of the estates, and because they opposed Maurice‚Äôs foreign policy goals they prevented him from raising an army. After years of fruitless struggle, in 1627 the estates forced Maurice to abdicate to his son William. William now became Landgrave William V, with Amalie Elisabeth as his Landgravine. From the beginning of his reign, William V desired to reverse the humiliating settlement forced on Hesse-Kassel by the Emperor and the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. His anti- Imperial sentiments were further enflamed by the issuing of the Edict of Restitution in 1629, which strengthened Imperial authority and directly threatened his religion. In 1630, when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded to oppose the Emperor, William V became the first German prince to officially ally with Sweden. Initially, the war went well for the allies, with William V and the Swedes achieving many victories. As the war continued William V began to receive subsidies from France. The allies also eventually occupied several territories in Westphalia, which Gustavus Adolphus granted to William V in lieu of subsidies. These subsidies and territories gave William V an independent source of revenue, preventing the Hessian estates from obstructing his war effort as they had his father‚Äôs. When William V was away on military campaigns, Amalie Elisabeth ran affairs in Hesse-Kassel on his behalf. The Imperial and Spanish troops' victory against Sweden in the 1634 Battle of N√∂rdlingen led many German princes to desert Sweden and sign the Peace of Prague with the Emperor. However, because he was excluded from the general amnesty and because the Peace of Prague did not protect the rights of Calvinists, William V was one of the few princes who refused to make peace. Instead, he signed an alliance with the French, who now officially joined the war on the side of the Swedes. On the 13th of June 1636 William V liberated the city of Hanau, Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs birthplace, from a siege by Imperial troops. Despite this success the Peace of Prague had decisively shifted the balance of the war in the Emperor‚Äôs favor, and military defeats soon left Hesse-Kassel itself under attack by Imperial armies. These defeats forced William V, Amalie Elisabeth, and their 8 year-old son and heir William to withdraw to the territory of East Frisia, which had been recently occupied by William V‚Äôs forces. During this flight, William V and Amalie Elisabeth had to leave their young daughters Amelia, Charlotte, Elisabeth and Louise behind in Kassel. William V soon fell ill, and on October 1st, 1637, he died in Leer, East Frisia, at age 36. His will named Amalie Elisabeth as regent for their still underage son, now William VI. The most important instrument of power he left his wife was his army, which had been able to flee to Frisia. Regency Engraving of Countess Amalie Elisabeth  Consolidation of Power  William V's will stipulated that Amalie Elisabeth should rule at the head of a regency council composed of the former members of his royal council. However, the Landgravine quickly enforced her own authority and diminished the influence of the other regency council members. She accomplished this by frequently flattering the councilors and shaming them when they did not eagerly obey her. She also physically separated them by sending them on frequent diplomatic missions across Europe. Another tactic she used to great effect was delaying decisions when the councilors pushed her to do things she did not wish to do. She even delayed the official establishment of the regency government, thus leaving the councilors‚Äô authority in question. Amalie Elisabeth also moved quickly to secure control over her late husband‚Äôs army. In 17th century Europe, it was considered highly unusual for a female ruler to hold authority over military matters. As a result, after her ascension both Charles Louis, Prince Palatine, and William V‚Äôs half-brother Landgrave Frederick of Hesse- Eschwege asked to be given command of Hesse-Kassel‚Äôs armies. Amalie Elisabeth rebuffed both advances, telling the Prince Palatine that he should not approach her while he had no lands, funds, or allies, and forcing Landgrave Frederick to accept her authority. Although she was determined to retain control over the army, she did allow its command to remain in the hands of her late husband‚Äôs top general, Peter Melander, Count of Holzappel. Retaining Melander was not without risk, as he was notoriously greedy and self- interested, so his defection was always a possibility. Amalie Elisabeth managed to retain Melander‚Äôs loyalty with the help of the French Court, which, fearing Melander‚Äôs defection to the Imperialists, offered him generous amounts of money and new titles. One of the Landgravine‚Äôs first actions as regent was to order the army and the inhabitants of the territories still under her control to swear an oath of loyalty to her young son William VI, further solidifying her power. Amalie Elisabeth faced unique threats to her legitimacy because she was a woman. Many in 17th century Europe considered government by women to be unjustifiable under any circumstances, but there were some exceptions. For example, in 1559 John Calvin wrote that ‚Äúthere were occasionally women so endowed, that the singular good qualities which shown forth in them, made it evident that they were raised up by divine authority.\\" Throughout her reign, Amalie Elisabeth asserted that she was one such woman, repeatedly claiming that God had placed her in this position and it was her responsibility to carry out his will. She also stressed her role as a widow and mother to reinforce her legitimacy, refusing any course of action which would violate her late husband‚Äôs intent or compromise her son‚Äôs inheritance. Amalie Elisabeth also continued her husband‚Äôs efforts to limit the power of the Hessian estates. Because she retained the territories occupied by her husband and eventually renegotiated subsidies from the French, she maintained sources of revenue independent of the estates. As a result, she was able to overlook the estates‚Äô hostility towards her government and rebuff their repeated calls for peace. She was also able to dismiss the grievances of the estates when they were presented to her upon her return to Hesse-Kassel. Diplomacy Amalie Elisabeth inherited a desperate situation from her husband. Although she held East Frisia and other territories in Westphalia, the countryside of Hesse-Kassel was under Imperial occupation and its fortresses were under siege. The situation deteriorated further in late October 1637, when Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt, son of Landgrave Louis V, announced that the Emperor had declared the late William V an enemy of the Empire, annulled his will, and appointed George II as imperial administrator of Hesse-Kassel. The situation within Hesse-Kassel was so desperate that Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs councilors and the Hessian estates opened negotiations with George II at Marburg and urged the Landgravine to accept whatever terms were necessary to achieve peace. However, George II refused to offer any concessions and demanded Hesse-Kassel‚Äôs unconditional submission to the Emperor. He also demanded very harsh terms for his own benefit, such as further territorial concessions to Hesse-Darmstadt, control over her regency government, and that the Hesse-Darmstadt line supplant Hesse-Kassel‚Äôs as the senior Hessian house. Amalie Elisabeth concluded that the terms were intolerable and unjust and repeatedly refused to ratify the agreement, against the advice of her councilors. Events soon vindicated her repeated refusals to make peace, as in 1638 the French and Swedish armies, along with Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, defeated and captured an Imperial army at the Battle of Rheinfelden. This victory allowed Hessian General Peter Melander to successfully negotiate a cease-fire with the Imperial forces in the region. With her position quickly improving, Amalie Elisabeth sought a better settlement than the terms offered by Landgrave George II. To this end she and her councilors appealed to the other German princes, arguing that George II‚Äôs stubbornness and unreasonable demands were preventing a settlement from being reached. As more princes were convinced by this argument, and as the French and Swedish continued to gain momentum, the Emperor decided to revoke George II‚Äôs authority over the negotiations and appointed the Elector of Mainz to conclude the treaty.The Elector of Mainz was one of the princes whose lands in Westphalia were occupied by Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs forces, so he sought to make peace as quickly as possible. The Elector offered more generous terms, including no further territorial or political concessions to Hesse-Darmstadt and official recognition of the right of all Calvinist princes to practice their religion. Amalie Elisabeth was delighted by these terms and agreed to ratify the treaty. The Emperor, however, refused to ratify it, as the legalization of Calvinism was not a concession he was willing to accept. While she was negotiating with the Emperor for a separate peace, Amalie Elisabeth also negotiated with France. After the death of William V, the French feared that Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs regency was unstable and could collapse, so they halted all subsidy payments to Hesse-Kassel. Although French agents had since reported that the Landgravine had a firm grip on power, by early 1639 the subsidy payments had still not resumed. She thus requested that the subsidies be renewed and increased and that the alliance between France and Hesse-Kassel be restored. In the ensuing negotiations, Amalie Elisabeth used her gender to her advantage by portraying herself as an unfortunate widow faced with a desperate situation and in dire need of help from the French court. She also stressed Hesse-Kassel‚Äôs importance to the allied cause, claiming that if she were to fall France and Sweden would not be able to defeat the Emperor. In addition to these tactics, she strengthened her negotiating position by making her negotiations for peace with the Emperor public, signaling to the French that she would make a separate peace if they did not agree to her terms. The French eventually agreed to her demands, and in August 1639 they signed the Treaty of Dorsten, renewing the alliance and granting her a greater subsidy than her husband had received. Over the next decade of war, the alliance between France and Hesse-Kassel would remain firm, and Amalie Elisabeth would maintain amicable ties with the French court. Her efforts also earned her the admiration of the First Minister of France, Cardinal Richelieu, who wrote in 1637 that the Landgravine ‚Äúdefended herself with courage, not least by the force, as by the justice of her cause.\\" Thirty Years' War After renewing Hesse-Kassel‚Äôs alliance with France, Amalie Elisabeth rejoined the war on the allied side. She soon agreed to support a joint allied offensive and in 1640 ordered General Peter Melander to link up with the armies of France and Sweden. Melander, however, did not support rejoining the war against the Emperor and strongly objected to serving under the Swedish Field Marshal Johan Ban√©r, who had been given overall command of the allied army. In July 1640 Melander returned to Kassel and offered his resignation. Amalie Elisabeth, having had enough of Melander‚Äôs criticisms of her leadership, accepted the resignation. Peter Melander would later become a general in the Imperial army and fight against Hesse-Kassel. Over the remaining course of the war, the Landgravine chose several other men to command her armies, including Count Kaspar von Eberstein and Johann von Geyso. Amalie Elisabeth remained allied with France and Sweden and committed the army of Hesse-Kassel to their cause until the end of the war. In 1641 Hessian troops fought alongside the French and Swedish armies. winning a pyrrhic victory in the Battle of Wolfenb√ºttel. In January 1642, Hessian forces assisted the French army under the Comte de Gu√©briant in winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Kempen, strengthening the allied position along the Rhine. Later that year, the Swedish attempted to relieve a Hessian force under siege in Dorsten, where Amalie Elisabeth had once held court, but they were too late, and Dorsten fell to Imperial forces in September. Two Hessian cavalry regiments fought alongside Swedish Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson‚Äôs forces at the Second Battle of Breitenfeld in October 1642. The battle was a major victory for the allies, leaving the Habsburg Hereditary lands vulnerable and further turning the tide of the war. Hessian forces were also present at the last battle of the Thirty Years‚Äô War, which took place at Wevelinghoven in 1648. In this battle, Hessian, French, and Swedish forces under Johann von Geyso defeated an Imperial army under Guillaume de Lamboy. In addition to committing troops to the major campaigns of the war, Amalie Elisabeth also launched initiatives to increase the size of her children‚Äôs inheritance. For example, in 1641 the last count of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg died without a male heir and a succession struggle ensued between many different claimants. Amalie Elisabeth had a great deal of influence in Hanau-M√ºnzenberg because it was the county of her birth, her husband had liberated it from Imperial siege in 1636, and its government owed money to Hesse-Kassel. One claimant, Count Friedrich Casimir of Hanau-Lichtenberg, offered to allow the territory to revert to Hesse-Kassel if his line ever lacked a male heir in exchange for Amalie Elisabeth supporting his claim. She accepted the deal and in 1643 Count Friedrich Casimir won the succession struggle with her help. Thereafter if the Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg ever died without a male heir, Hanau-M√ºnzenberg would belong to Hesse-Kassel, which eventually took place in 1736. Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs most significant initiative was her campaign to reclaim the Marburg inheritance lost to Hesse-Darmstadt by her late father-in-law. In October 1643, she re-asserted Hesse-Kassel‚Äôs claim to the territory, using the opinions of legal experts to show that the 1627 treaty conceding it was both illegal and forced. In 1645, she went a step further by launching an invasion and occupying Marburg and the rest of the disputed territory. This was the start of the Hessenkrieg, or \\"Hessian War,\\" which would be waged throughout the later stages of the Thirty Years‚Äô War. Initially, the experienced army of Hesse-Kassel was easily able to defeat the meager forces Landgrave George II was able to muster. However, George II requested aid from the Imperialists, and the Emperor and the Elector of Bavaria sent a force under Peter Melander to assist him. Amalie Elisabeth called upon her French and Swedish allies to support her, and the main focus of the war shifted to the conflict in Hesse. In 1647 Melander managed to retake the city of Marburg, but the city‚Äôs fortress held out and Melander‚Äôs army began to run out of supplies. In December of that year a cannonball from the fortress seriously injured Melander, and in January 1648 his army retreated from the territory. Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs forces re-occupied Marburg, and George II was forced to come to terms. In April of that year, both Hessian houses signed an agreement in which Amalie Elisabeth received most of the disputed territory, including the valuable city of Marburg.  Peace of Westphalia  In 1642, diplomats laid plans to host a general peace conference between the Emperor, the French and the Swedish in the Westphalian cities of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, although the negotiations would not begin for several more years. Once they began all the princes of the Empire were invited to attend the congress, with Catholic princes joining the French at M√ºnster and Protestant princes going to Osnabr√ºck with the Swedes. Because Amalie Elisabeth was one of the few German princes remaining at war with the Emperor, she sent diplomatic delegations to both M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck. Throughout the negotiations the Landgravine instructed her diplomats to pursue an uncompromising strategy to achieve her demands. This strategy did not endear her to any of the other princes, as her demands were far more ambitious than they had expected and many thought she was being unreasonable. In addition to negotiating with the princes of the Empire, Amalie Elisabeth also had to repeatedly ensure that her French and Swedish allies would not abandon her demands in favor of their own. One of Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs most ambitious demands was a formal change in the structure of the Holy Roman Empire. Her husband, the late Landgrave William V, had been a staunch opponent of the Habsburg emperors‚Äô attempts at centralization and believed that every Imperial prince should enjoy the same rights. Amalie Elisabeth thus sought to achieve her husband‚Äôs goal of stripping the Emperor and the Electors of their power over the Empire by formalizing an aristocratic interpretation of the Imperial constitution. This goal was also supported by the French, the Swedes, and a few German princes, the most prominent of which was the Elector of Brandenburg. However, these allies were prevented from working together by other disputes. Sweden and Brandenburg both claimed the territory of Pomerania, so the Imperial negotiator mediated the dispute, awarding Sweden half of Pomerania and compensating Brandenburg with lands elsewhere. As a result of this mediation, both parties agreed to drop their demands for changes to the constitution of the Empire. Without their support, Amalie Elisabeth was unable to achieve all of her constitutional goals. Although a complete re-interpretation of the Imperial constitution did not occur, Amalie Elisabeth and her allies did achieve important concessions on this issue. The Peace of Westphalia confirmed that every Imperial Prince had the right to make alliances and take up arms independently. The most important issue for Amalie Elisabeth was the question of religion. Throughout the conference she repeatedly demanded that Calvinism be given the same legal status within the Empire as Catholicism and Lutheranism. She faced strong opposition on this issue, both from the Emperor‚Äôs delegates and from those of the Lutheran princes, who were not inclined to make common cause with their fellow protestants. However, this was not an issue she was willing to compromise on, as she had repeatedly refused to make peace in the past without explicit protections for her religion. Eventually her hardline stance won out, and the delegates agreed to grant Calvinists the same rights enjoyed by Catholics and Lutherans since the Peace of Augsburg. Amalie Elisabeth also advanced the interests of Hesse-Kassel throughout the conference. She initially demanded territorial concessions from the princes whose lands in Westphalia she occupied. These demands were strongly opposed by many other princes, so she eventually agreed to drop them in exchange for 600,000 Reichsthalers in reparations payments. Although she did not achieve these territorial demands, she did gain recognition of her acquisition of the Marburg inheritance and several smaller territories such as Hersfeld Abbey and parts of the County of Schaumburg. In addition, the Landgravine successfully negotiated an amnesty going back to 1618 for herself and all other princes outside the Habsburg hereditary lands. With the help of Sweden and France, she also secured a compensation payment to demobilize her army, the only German territory to do so. In total Amalie Elisabeth achieved many of her objectives and wielded significant influence on the Peace of Westphalia, despite being the ruler of a minor German state. In the Treaties of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, there are a full 15 paragraphs specifically addressing the affairs of Hesse-Kassel and Amalie Elisabeth.  Death  Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs efforts during the war and the burdens they brought with them had a lasting impact, and her health had steadily deteriorated through the war. In September 1650, she declared her intention to abdicate and transfer power to her son William VI, who had turned 21 earlier that year. On the 5th of October, she held an extravagant abdication ceremony, attended by her advisors and the Hessian estates, at which William VI was officially granted control over the court. Before her abdication, Amalie Elisabeth had overseen the marriage of her daughter Charlotte to Elector Charles Louis of the Palatinate. In March 1651, she and her daughter Elisabeth traveled to Heidelberg to visit the newly married Electress Charlotte and her husband. While she was there, she suffered a severe bout of rheumatism in her foot and had to have part of it amputated in a painful surgery. Amalie Elisabeth returned to Kassel completely exhausted and with her condition much deteriorated. Four weeks later, on August 8th, 1651, Amalie Elisabeth died in her sleep in Kassel. She was buried in the Martinskirche cemetery on September 30th.  Legacy  Amalie Elisabeth was remembered fondly among Calvinists for her efforts to preserve the Reformed faith in the Holy Roman Empire. When she visited Heidelberg in 1651, she was praised by the city‚Äôs inhabitants, who called her a second Deborah. In his 1901 book Women of the Reformed Church, James Isaac Good calls her both a ‚ÄúReformed Deborah‚Äù and a ‚ÄúReformed Joan of Arc.\\" Her first biography was likely written by Christian Gottfried K√∂rner and appeared as an appendix to the Representation of the Thirty Years War by Friedrich Schiller. Amalie Elisabeth was one of only four women accepted into King Ludwig I's Walhalla hall of fame during his lifetime (There are twelve women present today). Her bust was carved by Christian Friedrich Tieck. Although Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs reign was remembered for generations, modern scholarship on the Thirty Years‚Äô War often pays little or no attention to her or her accomplishments. The foremost English-language biography on her is The Iron Princess: Amalia Elizabeth and the Thirty Years' War, written by Dr. Tryntje Helfferich and published in 2013. In her book, Dr. Helfferich argues that Amalie Elisabeth‚Äôs role in the Thirty Years‚Äô War has been marginalized in modern works ‚Äúlargely because she was a woman, for her role in the Thirty Years War rivaled that of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, Cardinal Mazarin, or even King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.\\"Bust in the Walhalla by Christian Friedrich Tieck Issue *Agnes (1620‚Äì1621) *Moritz (1621‚Äì1621) *Elisabeth (1623‚Äì1624) *Wilhelm (1625‚Äì1626), Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Kassel *Emilie (1626‚Äì1693), married in 1648 to Henri Charles de La Tr√©moille (1620‚Äì1672) *William VI, Landgrave of Hesse- Kassel (1629‚Äì1663), married in 1649 to Margravine Hedwig Sophie of Brandenburg (1623‚Äì1683) *Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (1627‚Äì1686), married 1650‚Äì1657 (div.) to Charles I Louis of the Palatinate (1617‚Äì1680) *Philipp (1630‚Äì1638) *Adolf (1631‚Äì1632) *Karl (1633‚Äì1635) *Elisabeth (1634‚Äì1688), Princess-Abbess of Herford *Luise (1636‚Äì1638) References - Category:1602 births Category:1651 deaths Category:17th-century women rulers Category:Countesses of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg Category:House of Hesse-Kassel Category:Landgravines of Hesse-Kassel Category:German people of the Thirty Years' War Category:North Hesse ","title":"Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg"},{"id":"29167943","text":"Philip P.

First published in 1947, the book is known for its meticulous study of metrical verse and for its examples of Winters' system of ethical criticism. The collection consists of three books of critical essays that Winters had written earlier. The first, Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry, is Winters' revised doctoral dissertation on the classification and analysis of poetic structures. The second, Maule's Curse: Seven Studies in the History of American Obscurantism, is a study of seven prominent American novelists and poets of the 19th century. The third, The Anatomy of Nonsense, is a study of several prominent writers associated with modernism. The book also contains three general essays that are crucial to understanding Winters as a critic and poet: the Foreword to the whole collection, \\"Preliminary Problems,\\" which is in effect the introduction to The Anatomy of Nonsense, and \\"The Significance of 'The Bridge,' by Hart Crane, or 'What Are We to Do with Professor X?'\\". Though he started his poetic career in the early 1920s as a free-verse imagist, by late in that decade Winters had become a modern classicist, of a sort.Wisdom and Wilderness 92 He argued that poets should use metrical verse more often in their compositions. He also argued that poems should have rational structures and favor discursive language rather than the loose, associationist structures and styles favored by the moderns, which emphasize the emotions and personal expression.Revolution and Convention 203 As is explained in these essays, Winters considered the moderns the literary descendants of Romanticism.In Defense of Reason 52 __TOC__  Content  The study of the structure of modern poetry in Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry is complex and challenging. Winters presents an elaborate and unique classification system of structures and methods, with an assessment of each kind of structure or approach to help readers understand how poets write in the modern age. In the course of his discussion, Winters also lays out his moral theory of literature, along with his close study of metrical verse and his unusual and difficult theory of free verse, in which he first composed his poetry. Maule's Curse: Seven Studies in the History of American Obscurantism offers erudite short studies and appraisals of the writing careers, work by work, of James Fenimore Cooper (moderately favorable), Nathaniel Hawthorne (moderately favorable), Herman Melville (strongly favorable), Edgar Allan Poe (sharply unfavorable), Emily Dickinson (favorable, with qualifications), Henry James (favorable, with qualifications), and the little-known American poet Jones Very (favorable), who was a friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Winters' evaluations of these writers and their works are sometimes unusual, if not eccentric. The third work in the collection, The Anatomy of Nonsense, offers short, crisp, but detailed overviews and interpretations of the writings of Henry Adams (moderately unfavorable), T.S. Eliot (unfavorable), and Wallace Stevens (favorable, with qualifications). In addition, this section contains an essay on American critic and poet John Crowe Ransom that serves as Winters' defense of his own critical concepts, which Ransom had judged to be wrongheaded. The collection is so diverse that it is difficult to characterize in summary. Winters was opposed to the ascendant Romantic theory of literature, as he understood it. He strove to foster a particular kind of classicism in literature, his own brand of stately, polished, rational, discursive poetry (as well as controlled, stately fiction) that emphasizes ideas and concepts. Across this collection he also reveals his growing penchant for rating individual works of literature and for the centrality of literary evaluation to criticism, as well as his nascent interest in revising the canon of literature to conform to his ideas of classical greatness, or near perfection in poetry. (Winters uses the term, great, frequently in these writings, and elsewhere, to refer to artworks that he judges to be nearly perfect literary achievements of one kind or another.)Yvor Winters: Bibliography 28-39 The three general essays in critical theory mentioned in the introduction are crucial to understanding Winters' general theory of literature and his misgivings about and opposition to Romanticism. In the \\"Foreword,\\" Winters gives a lengthy and learned summation of his theory of poetry, which he calls the moral theory of literature. Winters contrasts this theory with his explications of the didactic, hedonistic, and Romantic theories, which he holds to be the three main critical strands of thought in western literary criticism.Revolution and Convention 202 In the \\"Preliminary Problems\\" essay, found in The Anatomy of Nonsense, he gives a trenchant, painstakingly logical, step-by-step summary of the criteria he uses in evaluating poems and assessing their greatness, particularly precise diction that subordinates emotion to conceptual content and rational structure.Yvor Winters: Bibliography 40 In the concluding \\"Bridge\\" essay, also found in The Anatomy of Nonsense, Winters examines the literary and psychological dangers facing poets who push Romantic ideas to what Winters believed to be their logical limits, one of whom was, in his judgment, Hart Crane. (\\"The Bridge\\" referred to is a famous poem by Hart Crane, with whom Winters briefly corresponded about poetry shortly before Crane's death in 1932.) The essay considers Crane as a disciple of Walt Whitman, whose romantic concepts of life and literature Winters discusses at some length.Wisdom and Wilderness 77  Style  Yvor Winters' memorable prose is highly polished, formal, and exacting. He was a fine stylist and a strikingly scrupulous interpreter of literary artworks. He was often and sometimes still is mistakenly considered one of the New Critics because of his many careful readings of individual works of poetry, fiction, and drama. But, unlike the New Critics, his close reading was performed in the service of his moral theory of literature.Yvor Winters: Bibliography 1-5 In Defense of Reason also features Winters' acerbic comments in opposition to, and sometimes strongly disapproving of, various writers and critics usually held in high esteem in modern literary culture. For such comments he has been often called \\"brutal,\\" which, however, appears to be an exaggeration. Winters wrote like most other hard-hitting critics who waged battle in the critical wars surrounding the New Criticism in the middle of the 20th century.New Criterion, Vol. 15, June 1997, p. 27  Comments  *The irony is that his criticism could have been produced only in America and nowhere else in the world; it is as distinct a product of American life, though in the opposite direction, as any number of items of our popular culture. In its wrongheadedness, idiosyncrasies, rancorous eccentricities, and provincialism, it takes its place in the long line of that pathetic and peculiarly American phenomenon: the wandering off of superior gifts into private byways. *Winters stands in the peculiar position of a critic who uses the methods of analysis of the New Critics but rejects their evaluation of major trends in 20th-century poetry, in particular their high evaluation of Eliot's work. Winters often enough seems dogmatic and limited in his evaluations, but his analyses of poems are always perceptive and his theories, if not acceptable, have the virtue of being challenging. *Still there is no question of the soundness of many of Winters' judgments or the rightness of his desire that art be moral. The views have influenced various excellent writers and critics. Among them stand Robert Lowell, J. V. Cunningham, John Williams, Ann Stanford, N. Scott Momaday, Donald Davie, Wesley Trimpi, and Janet Lewis. Winters' belief that, run on whim and emotion, art would become directionless gains credibility from much of the poetry currently published. Under a banner of cultural pluralism, views are developing neither within the canon of a writer nor across canons, and, as with the weather in places, a reader has only to wait a few moments if he doesn't like what he now has. *Perhaps Winters' most striking and durable achievement is his account of the morality of poetic meter (In Defense of Reason, pp. 103‚Äì52, The Function of Criticism, pp. 81‚Äì100). The identity of a poetic line or of a whole poem, its \\"soul,\\" inheres not primarily in ideas or images but in the way it moves. Rhythm sounds at once in the \\"sensual ear\\" and in the \\"mind's ear\\" and in itself constitutes a mode of consciousness that facilitates certain mental operations and precludes others.Terry Comito, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism, 1994. *Of [modern poet- critics], Yvor Winters, perhaps, has fallen furthest. This is a great shame, for it is just Winters‚Äôs brand of seriousness and his emphasis on logic and reason in poetry that contemporary verse sorely wants. The current neglect may have as much to do with the notorious critic‚Äôs crabbed, sometimes contradictory and dogmatic style. Winters‚Äôs stern call for a \\"moral poetry\\" was provocative, while his more cracked judgments earned him the opprobrium of many who, like Stanley Edgar Hyman in The Armed Vision (1947), saw Winters as \\"an excessively irritating and bad critic of some importance.\\"David Yezzi, \\"The seriousness of Yvor Winters,\\" The New Criterion, June 1997. *The essay on [Henry] James shows a comparable power for summoning up characteristic particulars that suggest qualities of the whole work, as does the marvelous evocation of the psychology of Henry Adams, whose great history Winters champions as a major work in our literature. Very few critics have Winters' ability to vivify in prose the range of their reading ‚Äî all of Cooper, Melville, James, and Adams, for examples ‚Äî and the tone of his essays sometimes reflects the irritation and strain of an essentially self-taught man, an artist of the first rank, who explored American literature before it became a specialized field of study. The concerns of these central essays are drawn out, as variations on some themes, in the subsequent essays on Ransom and Crane, works of great rigor and insight.Kenneth Fields, \\"Introduction,\\" In Defense of Reason, 3rd edition, 1987.

Cedar is a term locals use for the Utah juniper tree. Because of its archaeological significance, the site was designated a State Historical Monument in 1970 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Edge of Cedars Indian Ruin in 1971. In 1974, the Utah Navajo Development Council donated the site to the Division of Utah State Parks and Recreation. Shortly thereafter the Utah Legislature enabled the establishment of Edge of the Cedars State Park as a museum of Indian history and culture. The museum opened in 1978.

Viewers were given an in depth look into the headlines that matter in the world of music. Hosted by Andrew Alba, Melissa Hetu and Barry Taylor, the show explored musical trends and events from indie rockers to the latest chart toppers. Aux Weekly aired on Aux. During its run, Aux Weekly was the only music-magazine program airing in Canada and became a staple for artist interviews and performances.  Location  The first season of the show was shot on location in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. During the shows second season, locations expanded to cities across Canada, The United States and overseas.  History  Aux Weekly was launched in October 2009 on AUX TV the channel. The show began as a one-hour, host- centered, music-magazine program, produced by Mel Francombe. The show originally contained host segments, music videos, interview packages, 420 Snack, in-studio performances and a recap of the week's music news. These segments became staples of the show in one form or another for the series' run, but the show quickly was changed to a thirty-minute format as music videos were dropped. By episode 16 of the first season, Jordan Delic took over as producer, and the show slowly streamlined its content. Host segments were reduced, a new intro and graphics were created, and segments were changed. The focus on the show modified to concentrate more on artist and band interviews and performances, as opposed to extended host segments. For the second season the show was given a facelift, with new graphics and theme song by The Arkells in \\"Pullin' Punches.\\" Host segments were dropped entirely, and replaced with more interview and performance segments. The shows weekly news segments was enlarged to quickly round up of the week's biggest music stories. Shows generally featured six packages, five interviews and one performance, which would take place in a different, unexpected location.

The Haast-Hollyford road or Haast-Hollyford Highway is a long-standing proposal to link Haast via the Hollyford Valley to Milford Sound and Te Anau in the South Island of New Zealand. Proposals for this road have been mooted since the 1880s. Proposals for the road have been suggested since the 1870s. The road was originally seen as the only land access to the port of Jackson Bay from the Otago goldfields, but it has never been possible to cross the Main Divide to Lake Wakatipu. A road has, however, been constructed north from Lake Te Anau to Milford Sound, which is a major tourist route, and most more recent proposals have focussed on extending this road north. The South Island Local Bodies Association regularly passed remits from the 1950s through to the 1980s in support of a road but the Ministry of Works, a government department responsible for road building during that period, repeatedly stated that such a road was not a priority for funding. Pros and cons of a Haast-Hollyford road One of the reasons for constructing the road is to relieve tourism congestion at Milford Sound. Currently, most tourists come from Queenstown and this results in a peak of activity in the middle of the day. The final stretch of the current road from the Hollyford Valley to Milford Sound is also subject to many closures during winter, significantly reducing tourist numbers around Te Anau. Construction of a Haast-Hollyford road would also give tourists an opportunity of seeing far more of the South Island within the same given time. A Haast- Hollyford route would significantly reduce the length of road tourists would travel if they were journeying between Fiordland and the West Coast. A purpose-built scenic drive designed to minimise environmental damage and maximise tourist enjoyment would put Haast only from Milford Sound; the distance at present is . One proposal has the road 198 km long. There is significant opposition to these proposals, however, as any road would have to pass through unspoilt land of significant natural beauty; the area is within Fiordland National Park, part of the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage area. Environmentalists strongly oppose construction of the road. An estimated cost for the construction of the road is NZ$300 million, and it is widely acknowledge that the proposed road would likely be a toll road. The high cost of constructing the road is given as a reason for putting it on an indefinite hold. Furthermore, the $300 million is disputed by opposers to the road. For example, Federated Mountain Clubs has obtained cost assessments from two independent roading engineers, both of whom estimate the construction cost to be at least $1 billion. Geography The planned routes for the proposed road pass through an area that has had very little in the way of human impact. The area is covered with beech and podocarp forest that has never been logged. There are a number of rivers and lakes along the proposed route. One of the proposed routes would go through Fiordland National Park and Mount Aspiring National Park as well as the Awarua Point Conservation Area, and would follow the Hollyford Track (a tramping track in the Hollyford Valley). History of road proposals=Nineteenth century Photolithographed at the General Survey Office, Wellington NZ August 1884. Map of the proposed road to link the settlements of Martins Bay and Jacksons Bay Otago provincial leaders identified the need for a road between Otago and South Westland's goldfields in 1865, and sent surveyor Vincent Pyke to explore. Pyke came back with an idea for a Clyde-Haast railway that was never fulfilled but provided some basis for a road to Wanaka, which opened 100 years later. A Haast-Hollyford road was considered key to further Westland development. The road's history forms a not-so-small chapter in the story of West Coast settlement in the 1870s, promoted by then Prime Minister Sir Julius Vogel. In 1876 Duncan Macfarlane, the Government agent at Jackson Bay, and Gerhard Mueller, Westland's chief surveyor, focused on the alpine route in 1876 and 1884 respectively. Some construction occurred at the northern end in 1885, and again in 1891. Mueller and James McKerrow drew up a topographical plan of the area between the Jackson and Hollyford Rivers in 1884, showing the proposed route between Lake Wakatipu and Jacksons Bay. This was published in the appendices to the journal of the House of Representatives 1884 Volume 1 Page 73, now held at National Archives. Two years later, Mueller proposed a road from the Cascade Plateau to the junction of the Pyke and Hollyford Rivers. A full survey and plan of the 47-mile stretch was completed about this time. By 1898 there was a metalled horse-track between the Cascade and Barn Bay. 1901‚Äì1945 Little was done on the planned road until the Great Depression, when it was seen as a possible unemployment relief work scheme. By April 1931 about 200 men were employed on the Milford Road, and over the course of 18 months, of road were completed. In April 1934, a preliminary survey of the mountain country through which the Milford Road would pass was completed. By June, an announcement that the Government had decided to complete the Eglinton Valley Road through to Milford Sound was made. The road had by now reached Marian Corner, where the route meets the valley of the Hollyford River. The crossing of the main divide between the Hollyford River and Milford Sound basin was the most difficult and costly part of the undertaking, and necessitated the driving of a long tunnel. It was generally considered that the Gertrude Saddle was the most favourable point at which to cross the divide, but the tunnelling required on this route was found to be nearly in length, whereas it was possible to pass under the Homer Saddle with one tunnel of in length. J.H. Christie and T. Evans, the Town Clerk of Hokitika, made a report and assessment for the Public Works Department of the proposed Haast Pass road in 1935. The report sparked the new Labour Government to approve the road from Bruce Bay to the Haast Pass, and also a road from Haast to Hollyford as part of the same project. Christie said that a road from the Arawhata River to the Upper Hollyford was estimated to cost ¬£175,000. By 11 April advance workers on the Te Anau-Milford Sound Road had reached the 58-mile peg, approximately from the eastern entrance to the tunnel. By November, preparations were complete for the driving of a tunnel through the Homer Saddle at a height of above sea level. The work was expected to be slow but uneventful, with the bore passing through scree at both ends and solid granite in between. Power for the work's 12 compressed air drills was supplied by a hydro-electric plant situated about six miles from the scene of operations. Tunnelling was all done from the Southern end, as it was impossible to transfer materials and plant to the Cleddau Valley section. It was estimated that the road from Te Anau to Milford Sound would be completed by late 1937. Later the same year J. Collins, New Zealand Trade Commissioner and representative of the Tourist and Publicity Department in Canada and the United States, stated that if the proper facilities were provided for travellers, the road to Milford would be travelled by 25,000 tourists during the summer season. A large number of those to visit the road would be New Zealanders, but if its attraction were given proper publicity abroad it would attract thousands of tourists from overseas. He advised that provision should be made, if possible, for air-strips. The lower Hollyford end of the Haast‚ÄìHollyford road was started heading north from the Marian Corner in August 1936. Work was also started on the route the following month in South Westland, with the idea of providing relief work for the unemployed. Work was abandoned due to the necessities of the war effort in October 1940. This drew an end to work on the road until the 1960s. 1946‚Äì1975 Alice McKenzie's 1947 book Pioneers of Martins Bay: Life in New Zealand's Most Remote Settlement recorded the settlers' desire for a road over the Haast‚ÄìHollyford route. An appendix to the book by Dr F. G. Hall-Jones noted that settlers suspected Otago's provincial leaders would not support the road because it would lead directly from the Wakatipu goldfields to the Jackson Bay harbour and on to Australia, leaving Dunedin merchants \\"far out of the picture\\". In 1961, the Labour Department made funds available for the employment of seasonal workers on the southern section of the road along the Hollyford Valley, which reached the Humboldt Falls (originally known as High Falls) where work continued until 1967. Only normal maintenance work has been carried out since, though from 1968 Westland County Council began building a road south towards the Hollyford Valley, eventually reaching Cascade Valley. T.C.H. Mouatt made another report on the feasibility of a Haast‚ÄìHollyford road in 1964, stating that \\"the route is an obvious and desirable roading possibility\\". The following year Prime Minister Keith Holyoake opened the Haast Pass road. He stated at the time that he hoped to return to Westland in 10 years‚Äô time to open a completed Haast‚ÄìHollyford road. In 1973, plans were made to mine high-grade asbestos from the Red Hills. Mackley and Graham Ferguson were employed by American mining company Kennecott Utah Copper Ltd and Cassiar Explorations Ltd, a Canadian company, to build a haul-road from the foot of the Red Hills to Big Bay. To get the machinery to Big Bay, it was driven through from Cascade Valley. Between June and October two bulldozers, a Caterpillar D8H and an International TD20 along with two support tractors, fuel sledges, a bunk-house, and cook-house traversed the country along the coast to the west end of the Pyke Gorge. Due to a fall in value of asbestos plans for the mine were abandoned. The Ferguson brothers retraced their tracks, arriving back at the Cascade Valley in December. 1976‚Äì2000 Further feasibility reports and engineering appraisals were made in 1976 by Ministry of Works engineer R.C. Holland, and in 1987 by Westland County manager Jon Olsen. The latter report estimated the cost of a road at $40 million. A further costing of the original inland route was done by McDermott Miller in 1989. This put the cost at $70 million. Later the same year the New Zealand Tourist and Publicity Department report, \\"Haast-Hollyford Road Reconnaissance\\" estimated the cost at $101.1 million. The campaign for a road was bolstered by the move to name the South Island west coast as a World Heritage Site. A visit to the area in 1989 by conservationist Dr David Bellamy. Bellamy said that the road should be restarted as \\"travellers should have access to an area people have fought hard to preserve as a World Heritage Site\\". Minister of Tourism Jonathan Hunt, pledged support for a \\"World Heritage Drive\\", saying that he and then Minister of Conservation Philip Woollaston were in favour of the link, and that the proposal was on its way to the Parliamentary select committee for economic development. In 1990, 2.6 million hectares of land ‚Äî almost 10% of New Zealand's total land area ‚Äî was designated as the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage area. This area includes four national parks (Westland Tai Poutini, Aoraki / Mount Cook, Mount Aspiring and Fiordland), as well as the land beside and in between them. At the opening of the new Milford Sound terminal building in 1992, New Zealand Minister of Tourism John Banks said \\"‚Ä¶. the completion of the Lower Hollyford‚ÄìWest Coast Road is the only safe logical step to increase tourism into this area‚Ä¶.\\" Further encouragement for reconsidering a road option came from former Minister of Tourism Rob Talbot. Civil engineers Duffill Watts & King prepared a report on the preferred coastal route the following year, estimating a total capital cost of $85 million. Southland and Westland District Councils, McConnell Dowell and several members of parliament suggested that a coastal route could be open by 1997. Southland's Mayor Frana Cardno said the road would be a major tourist attraction in its own right. New proposals were detailed in an article in the Fiordland Focus which suggested that the proposed road would shorten the journey from Milford to Haast from five hours to two hours. The plan incorporated a number of new features, and favoured financing it from non-governmental sources, partly through making it a toll- road. The proposed road was designed to conform to high environmental standards. In 1994, the Southland Times ran a series articles on the proposed road, written by Les Hutchins, a conservationist and tourism operator. Hutchins noted that the road over Wilmot Pass and the Milford Road were evidence that a link could be put through with minimum damage to the environment. He said there was no doubt the road would be of tremendous value to international and domestic tourism, and also noted the positive effect the proposed road would have on dangerous congestion problems on the Milford Road. In August, the Southland and Westland District Councils gave their support to the link and began investigating its feasibility as a toll road using private funding. A toll of $20 per user was mooted. Both councils recognised the environmental value of the region and the need for any construction to be carried out to strict standards. On 30 August, representatives from both District Councils and the construction firm McConnell Dowell met the Ministers of Tourism and Conservation, and following that meeting suggested a feasibility study be prepared (study to cost $360,000) and a public consultation process started. In preparation for this the Westland District Council surveyed the road line down the Cascade Valley as far as Barn Bay in 1997, in a failed attempt to legalise that section of road. On 20 September 2000, Nelson businessman Fred Willetts proposed in the Nelson Mail that a World Heritage Drive including both a Karamea‚ÄìCollingwood road and a Haast‚ÄìHollyford road would bring unlimited opportunities to New Zealand, opening up tourism opportunities and employment for the country. Each road was estimated to cost around $130 million. Since 2000 In April 2001, a tabloid publication was circulated via daily newspapers in the South Island by backers of the plan for both the Haast-Hollyford and Karamea-Collingwood links. The publication was widely criticised by environmental groups, including Fish and Game New Zealand, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand and the Green Party. Prior to the 2002 general election, the Leader of the Opposition Don Brash and others were given a reconnaissance helicopter flight over the full length of the route; all were very receptive to the concept and proposal. In 2004, Ted Loose, Chairman of Environment Southland, said in an editorial that \\"since [a Haast-Hollyford road] was first mooted, progress has been stymied by people purporting to care about the social, economic, and ecological effects of building a road through a National Park. And all the while, problems associated with congestion at, and on the road to Milford have been escalating.\\" The re-elected Mayor for Southland District, Frana Cardno, said in an editorial to the Southland Times on 9 October that the suggestion of the Haast‚ÄìHollyford road needed to be revived. In 2005, the Department of Conservation called for submissions on a new conservation plan. The old plan had said a road through the Hollyford Valley was ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù. Over 800 submissions were put received on many issues, but a large proportion (over 500) were in support of a link road. Submissions to the Westland District Council 2009-2019 Long Term Council Community Plan in 2009 supported the opening of the road. The Council passed a motion confirming their support for the proposed road and allocated $100,000 towards the gravelled road from Jackson Bay to the Cascade River. In 2010, Christchurch businessman Earl Hagaman commissioned a report (the Octa Report) suggesting a toll road could be built for $225‚Äì315 million. Hagaman, founder of the Scenic Circle Hotels chain, argued the road would be of national significance, boosting the $21.7 billion tourism industry and significantly reducing driving time to Milford Sound. Minister of Economic Development Gerry Brownlee met with the Westland and Southland district councils and with Hagaman, saying \\"I'm personally supportive of [a road] but it's not something that the Government is actually considering at the present time.\\" The Ministry of Economic Development briefly considered a new proposal for the road the same year, but did not see any net gain from an economic viewpoint. In 2012 the property arm of the Westland District Council had signed a Memorandum of Understanding to build a toll road and is proceeding with the drafting of resource consents. In 2013 it was revealed that Westland District Property Limited (the property arm of Westland District Council) would receive a $1 million success fee if consents for the road were granted. Westroads (Westland District Council's roading arm) were awarded a $30m contract to upgrade the section of the road between Arawhata and the Cascade.Lyell, Rebekah.

Origins In the aftermath of the June‚ÄìSeptember 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Amin Gemayel, convinced that a strong and unified national defense force was a prerequisite to rebuilding the nation, announced plans to raise a 60,000-man army organized into twelve brigades (created from existing infantry regiments), trained and equipped by France and the United States.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 123. In late 1982, the 7th Infantry Regiment was therefore re-organized and expanded to a brigade group numbering 2,000 men, most of whom were Maronite Christians from the Akkar and Koura Districts of northern Lebanon, and Shia Muslims and Druzes from the Chouf District, which became on June 20, 1983, at Scout City ‚Äì Batroun, the 7th Infantry Brigade. Emblem The Brigade's emblem is characterized by an Arabic numeral (7) symbolizing victory, with a green cedar tree set in the middle and symbol of persistence, both encircled by a rampart representing an historical fortress with the motto \\"all for Lebanon\\" written in Arabic script. The black background is a symbol of endurance. Structure and organization The new unit grew from an understrength battalion comprising three rifle companies to a fully equipped mechanized infantry brigade, capable of aligning a Headquarters' (HQ) battalion, an armoured battalion (74th) equipped with Panhard AML-90 armoured cars, AMX-13 light tanks (replaced in the late 1980s by T-55A tanks donated by Iraq),Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), p. 53. M48A5 main battle tanks, three mechanized infantry battalions (71st, 72nd and 73rd) issued with M113 and AMX- VCI armored personnel carriers,Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), p. 56. plus an artillery battalion (75th) fielding US M198 155 mm howitzers. The Brigade also fielded a logistics battalion, equipped with US M151A2 jeeps, Land-Rover long wheelbase series III, Chevrolet C20 and Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups and US M35A2 2¬Ω-ton military trucks. Initially headquartered at the Nohra Shalouhi Barracks near Batroun, in 1983 the brigade was commanded by the Druze General Nadim al-Hakim, who was concurrently the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) Chief-of-Staff,O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 131‚Äì132. later replaced by Colonel Issam Abu Jamra (former commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade), who was in turn succeeded by Col. Faris Lahud, formerly the head of the Brigade's logistics battalion. In 1989, the latter was replaced by Col. Sami Rihana, previously the commander of the 9th Brigade. Combat history=Lebanese Civil WarThe Mountain War 1983-1984= During the Mountain War in early September 1983, 7th Brigade's units were deployed at Achrafieh and Hadath in Beirut, and at Dahr al-Wahsh facing Aley in the Chouf District southeast of the Lebanese Capital, where they faced the offensive of the main anti-government Druze militia, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP).Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), p. 86. Close to the end of the battle for Souk El Gharb on September 24, Gen. al-Hakim fled into PSP/PLA- held territory but he would not admit he had actually defected. The Brigade's 72nd battalion positioned at Dahr al-Wahsh was driven out from the Chouf by the Druze PSP/PLA militia and forced to withdraw to East Beirut in February 1984. That same month, the Brigade's predominately Shia Muslim 97th Battalion deserted en bloc to the Shi'ite 6th Infantry Brigade and the Amal Movement militia.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 137.Nerguizian, Cordesman & Burke, The Lebanese Armed Forces: Challenges and Opportunities in Post-Syria Lebanon (2009), pp. 56-57.Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), p. 87. =The post-Chouf years 1984-1990= By 1987, the 7th Infantry Brigade was composed of 1,700 men under the command of Colonel Faris Lahud. A contingent of the Brigade was stationed in the Byblos District, north of Beirut. This contingent was regarded as loyal to former President and leader of the Zgharta Liberation Army (ZLA) militia Suleiman Frangieh, whose feudal seat, Zgharta, is a few kilometers southwest of Tripoli.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 155. Consequently, the central government equipped this contingent with light weapons only. The brigade's headquarters was relocated to Amsheet, just north of Jounieh. Units at Amsheet were well equipped with US-made M48 tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers but were regarded as being under the sway of Lebanese Forces militia' Supreme Commander Samir Geagea, who maintained there his retinue.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), pp. 223-224. During General Michel Aoun's Liberation War in 1989-1990, the 7th Brigade led by Colonel Sami Rihana put a spirited defense of Madfoun and Kfar Abida in the Batroun District on 13-14 August 1989, inflicting heavy losses on attacking Syrian Army armored columns and later on September 13, the Brigade's units positioned at Mneitra were subjected to heavy mortar fire by the Syrians. To contradict false rumors that some units from both the 7th Brigade and the 2nd Brigade were preparing themselves to defect to Syrian-controlled territory and launch an assault on Madfoun, Chebtin and Sghar, Col. Rihana placed the former Brigade on full alert and issued a general mobilization order of all the unit's armored, infantry, and artillery formations held in reserve at Amsheet barracks and at Madfoun. On January 16, 1990, following a chilling of relations between Gen. Aoun's interim military government in East Beirut and the Lebanese Forces militia Command in Amsheet, the former instructed the 7th Brigade to conduct night security patrols with their military vehicles in the region of Byblos, Amsheet and Nahr Ibrahim to help maintain order. The post-civil war years 1990-present Upon the end of the war in October 1990, the 97th Battalion was returned to the 7th Brigade, which was re-integrated into the structure of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).

Design and Development Stars & Stripes 87 was built in 1986.Conner p. 46 She was the culmination of the team‚Äôs 12 Meter design advances, the fifth boat in the Sail America Foundation stable, and the third of the new boat designs by Britton Chance Jr., Bruce Nelson and David Pedrick.Conner p. 42 In 1983 the Cup had been lost to a wing keeled boat that was markedly quicker in stays than Liberty. It was known that the course for the Cup in 1987 would have an increase in the number of legs, going from six legs to eight. There had been no change made in the course length to be sailed, thus the distance of each leg was shorter. Most believed this would place a greater premium on design trends established in Australia II, a boat which could turn fast and accelerate out of a tack quickly. Conner chose not to follow the common reasoning. His direction to the design team was to create a boat built for straight ahead speed. Conner believed pure boat speed would be the most important factor for success in the heavy seas and strong winds expected at Gage Roads off Fremantle.Conner p. 49 The boat designed was framed longitudinally rather than transversely, making the boat stiffer and stronger without a corresponding weight increase. The keel had a bulbous lead. A pair of wings extended off the aft-most third of the keel. The boat's snub nose entry was not the most aesthetic of designs, but the result was a fast, heavy air boat.Conner p. 48 John Marshall, Conner's mainsheet trimmer on board Liberty in the '83 campaign, was made design team coordinator. Marshall was essential to the team's success during the testing and tuning phase. Stars & Stripes 87 was competitive in 10 to 12 knots of wind, and excelled in winds of 16 knots and more.Fisher p. 17 Sea Trials and Selection Dennis Conner sea trialed the boats against each other in the Pacific waters of Hawaii, taking advantage of the steady 18 to 25 knot trade winds off Waikiki (33 to 46 km/h, or 21 to 29 mph).Conner p. 32 The in-house competition between boats was intense, particularly between the 86 and 87 boats, with Stars & Stripes 87 receiving the nod for the trip to Australia. The 85 boat was taken as well as a trial horse against which changes made to the 87 boat could be measured. Louis Vuitton Cup Stars & Stripes 87 was a clear contender from the start of the 1987 Louis Vuitton Cup regatta, winning 11 of 12 races in the first round robin, including the only round robin victory of any boat over Kiwi Magic (KZ 7). The second round was a period of concern. Conner's boat was optimized for heavy airs, and suffered from a shortage of sails for lighter breezes. When a spell of Easterlies settled over Western Australia she was caught out of her element and dropped a disappointing four races. She lost to Tom Blackaller and USA in 5 to 10 knot winds, and the following day to the Kiwis, even though the breeze had picked up to 22 knots. On the ninth day she lost again to the British team White Crusader in 4 to 6 knot breezes, and the following day to Canada II, which she had led around the final mark but was caught out when the breeze died away.Fisher, p. 108 Aided by between-round changes to her keel winglets and the more consistent presence of the \\"Fremantle Doctor\\" in late summer, the third round saw her come to form, with significant improvement in her upwind performance. The final round robin she lost twice, to the top boat Kiwi Magic and to the always competitive USA. Coming into the Louis Vuitton Cup finals she was the second highest point scorer, and was set on a collision with longtime rival Tom Blackaller, and USA. Finals Form Dennis Conner believed his effort with Liberty reached her maximum speed potential too early during the 1983 Cup defense.Lester p. One of the goals of the Stars & Stripes 87 camp was to increase boat speed throughout the campaign to peak going into the finals. All boats competing underwent changes during the challenger and defender series, some successful, some not. Changes made on Stars & Stripes 87 consistently resulted in steps forward in boat speed. This was largely thanks to Marshall, whose technical, sailmaking and organizational skills enabled him to coordinate a great deal of technical information.Fisher, p. 16 The greatest increase occurred with the re-working of the boat's keel between the second and third round robins. Close competitor Tom Blackaller felt the boat had found a increase in Velocity made good when sailing to windward as she entered the third round robin.Fisher, p. 50 The final tweak was the application of a drag reducing shark skin like riblet covering, applied to the hull just prior to the challenger finals. Louis Vuitton Cup Semifinals and Finals KZ 7 was the top qualifier of the round robins, followed in the points competition by Stars & Stripes 87, USA and French Kiss. In the Challenger semi-finals KZ 7 easily defeated French Kiss 4-0, with none of the races closely contested. A far more spirited competition occurred between Stars & Stripes 87 and USA, with USA leading all of the first race till the final mark. In the end though Tom Blackaller couldn't quite find the speed he was looking for, and the result was Stars & Stripes 87 winning the semi 4-0. Tactitician Tom Whidden offered the following on the team's progress: \\"The low point was when we lost those four races in November and we really didn't set our boat up very well for that. The high point was beating Blackaller, four-zip. That was quite an accomplishment because he was extremely fast.\\" Going into the Louis Vuitton Finals, Kiwi Magic was the favorite. She was clearly a fast boat in both light and heavy air, had beaten Stars & Stripes 87 twice, and had won an incredible thirty- seven of thirty-eight match races. But Stars & Stripes 87 was showing her best form of the regatta, particularly in heavy winds above . The first two races were similar, with Stars & Stipes going out to an early lead in the opening beat to the first windward mark, and then holding that lead throughout the remainder of the race, holding ground on the downwind legs and extending it on the beats. The third race started out much as the previous two, with both boats taking a long tack out to the left hand side of the course in what Dennis Conner termed a \\"speed test\\". Stars & Stripes 87 reached the mark first, rounding the first windward mark 26 seconds ahead. Shortly thereafter a snap shackle failed causing the spinnaker to drop into the sea. The Kiwis closed the gap, gibing back and forth across Conner's stern until they achieved what they were looking for, an inside overlap on the bottom mark. Having gained right of way the Kiwis were able to slide ahead on the turn at the mark. Once there the Kiwis proved a very difficult boat to get past. On the second beat to windward they covered every move of the blue hulled boat, keeping Conner at bay with a tight cover. The two reaching legs did not allow room to get around a competitor, which brought the boats to the third beat to windward. This was one for the record books. Conner threw 55 tacks along with two false tacks in an effort to break away. The New Zealanders covered each move in one of the most exhausting and tense beats to windward in America's Cup history. The result was a win for the Kiwis, and a match series now close with Stars & Stripes up by a race, 2-1. The fourth race saw fortune make a complete change. Now it was KZ 7 that experienced a number of uncommon structural failures, all of which snowballed by the actions of the skipper and crew, culminating in Kiwi Magic blowing her backstay in an abrupt gibe. The race was lost to Stars & Stripes 87 by 3 minutes 38 seconds. The fifth race was extremely competitive. Stars & Stripes 87 took the initial lead on the first windward leg as she had in the first four races, but on the second beat to windward her Number 6 genoa blew to pieces, giving the Kiwis a chance to close down the gap and overtake Stars & Stripes 87. All hands went forward to clear the wreckage, and then bring to deck and hoist the Number 7 genoa, completing the task before Kiwi Magic could slip by. From there on Stars & Stripes 87 held on to the slimmest of leads throughout the next four legs. Rounding the final mark she held a six-second advantage with the Kiwis applying steady pressure, but here Dickson made one of the rare mistakes of his summer and struck the mark while rounding. The infraction required KZ 7 to come about and round again. The resulting time loss ended all hope the New Zealanders had of overtaking Stars & Stripes 87 in the final beat. Stars & Stripes 87 took the series, four races to one. Syndicate head Michael Fay summed up the New Zealander's effort: \\"We did the best we could. We couldn't beat the other guy on the day, and we've got to shake his hand and say 'Well done' because that's what happened. They did a very good job and they beat us.\\" Added helmsman Chris Dickson: \\"The best boat won. Thirteen years beat thirteen months experience.\\" Following the completion of the race, Gianfranco Alberini, Commodore, Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, the Challenge Club of Record responsible for organizing the challenger selection process had at last completed his responsibilities. \\"We have concluded today two hundred and twenty three races. It was quite an historic performances, and I think it will go down in the Guinness records. Two hundred twenty three races, very successful selecting the two best yachts for the finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup, and the best challenger for the America's Cup 87.\\" America's Cup The America's Cup was entered into with much hope for the defender Kookaburra squad. The Kookaburra's were the upstarts, beating out Australia IV and the Alan Bond syndicate with the help of a late round keel modification that finally gave Kookaburra III a clear edge in speed. After racing intensely for months the defense of the Cup was at hand. Though the first race was raced in light airs, thought to be Kookaburra's best conditions, Stars & Stripes 87 reached the first mark ahead. She led throughout the race, never being seriously threatened. This first test between the two boats was a harbinger of more to come. It was clear Stars & Stripes 87 had the edge in sailing to windward, even in light air, and could hold her own on the downwind legs. The Fremantle Doctor returned after the first match, and with the heavy winds came an even greater difference in boat speeds. The Aussies gave a great effort, but they simply lacked the boat speed to stay with Stars & Stripes 87, which showed a consistent twenty second advantage on each beat to windward. She won the series in a four-race sweep.Fisher, p. 248 Stars & Stripes 87 was not a light weather boat, nor was she as quick in stays as either Kiwi Magic or Kookaburra III, but in the heavier winds off Fremantle she could outpace any challenger in straight-line sailing to windward. She was equally able to foot for pace to escape a windward cover, or point higher to power away from an opponent on her windward quarter. Though both Kiwi Magic in the challenger finals and Kookaburra III in the America‚Äôs Cup were sailed aggressively, the edge in boat speed held by Conner allowed him to overpower his competitors in a series of long drag races to the first windward mark. The challenger finalists and cup defenders were unable to engage him in a tactical race, where the quicker Kiwis and Kookaburras held the advantage. Said Conner: \\"It's a difficult problem when you have a boat like Stars and Stripes that won't play the match racing game. When we don't tack and we don't cover, it's pretty hard for them to be aggressive and exploit the fact that they do tack better and maneuver better.\\"Fisher, p. 68 Conner believed his Stars & Stripes 87 held a increase in upwind speed over Liberty, the 12 Meter he had sailed in defense of the cup in 1983. This represented a remarkable increase in boat speed, and enabled Conner and his team aboard Stars & Stripes 87 to recapture the America‚Äôs Cup Trophy. Stars & Stripes 87 was the final 12 Meter to win the America's Cup, and as such she represented the zenith in 12 Meter design. Stars & Stripes 87 is currently berthed in St. Maarten http://www.12metre.com where she can be sailed for hire as a 12 Meter match race boat against Canada II and True North.

History  In the past, stone from the nearby quarry was being loaded onto trains here. The narrow-rail line for this purpose was built in 1924. On 21 May 2012 a 41-year-old woman died when she stumbled at the first platform when crossing the lines, falling down under a passing train. The accident caused seven trains to be delayed for a total time of 201 minutes.

History =Founding and early years In the year 1900, a pipeline salesman by the name of W.S. Porter convinced the presidents of the five largest companies in the Kern River Oil Field of California to enter into an agreement to turn over their oil interests to form a new company in exchange for stocks and bonds for the appraised value of their properties. The presidents of the companies were: W. G. Kerckhoff for Reed Crude Oil Company; Burton E. Green for Green-Whittier Oil Company; Charles A. Canfield for Canfield Oil Company; M. H. Whittier for Kern Oil Company; John A. Bunting for San Joaquin Oil & Development Company. Securing agreements from 34 other oil companies in the area the Associated Oil Company was incorporated on October 7, 1901 and on January 1, 1902 began actively producing and marketing crude oil. The Standard Oil Company and the Southern Pacific Railroad acquired an interest in Associated Oil for the purposes of transporting their own oil to the San Francisco Bay Area where it would be refined and marketed; jointly, the Southern Pacific needed fuel for its railroad steam engines. The Matson's Pacific Oil and Transportation Company was acquired in 1905, which included the Coalinga-Monterey pipeline and a refinery at Gaviota, California including other marine facilities. Subsidiaries In 1907, the Associated Pipe Line Company was formed as a subsidiary of the Associated Oil Company with the Southern Pacific Company providing property along its railroad tracks which ran from the Bakersfield Kern River oil fields to Port Costa, California later being shipped to China and other parts of the world. The Southern Pacific Company attained the controlling interest of the Associated Oil Company's stock. The Kern River Oil Field (purple) in south-central California. Other oil fields are shown in gray. There was a fast-growing market on the Pacific for petroleum distillates as well as crude oil and since the high gravity crude oil from the San Joaquin Valley required some sort of refining to make fuel usable for locomotives and ship burners, the Associated Oil Company decided to construct a topping plant called the Avon Refinery (now the Golden Eagle Refinery) in 1913. Until then the company had produced and marketed fuel oils only and with the completion of the refinery were launched into the manufacture of gasoline and kerosene. Also in 1913, unfavorable commuting conditions prompted the Associated Oil Company to build a company town called the Avon Village and by 1920 consisted of 65 cottages, a one-room schoolhouse, worker's bunkhouse, a dining hall and a clubhouse that included an indoor swimming pool, auditorium and a two-lane bowling alley which serves today as the Refinery Museum. A branch of the United States Post Office was established and named the Associated Post Office. Associated purchased the Amoroco Terminal in 1923 from the American-Oriental Refining Company (AMORCO) and consisted of a topping plant, storage tanks, a wharf, pipelines and pumping equipment. The next year a clarifying plant and an Edeleanu liquid dioxide plant, the first in the United States, were constructed at the Avon Refinery. The quality of the oils treated was so excellent that it prompted the U.S. Navy to purchase these lubricants exclusively from the Avon Refinery for many years. By 1925 the Avon Refinery became the first West Coast refinery to produce gasoline with tetraethyl lead additive and in 1926 the tanker ship S.S. McKittrick received the first crude receipt at the Amorco Wharf. The Southern Pacific Company bought the terminal in 1929 to construct a new railroad drawbridge a year later. Associated Oil service station from 1927, restored and moved to History Park at Kelley Park in San Jose, California In 1926, the Associated Oil Company stock owned by the Pacific Oil Company,Walker's Manual of Pacific Coast Securities, 1927 which was formed by Southern Pacific Company to handle their oil interests, was sold to a new holding company, the Tide Water Associated Oil Company, which also acquired the Tide Water Oil Company at the same time. Standard Oil of New Jersey, the largest stockholder in Tide Water at the time, later formed a holding company, Mission Corporation, to hold the stocks of Tide Water and Associated. Beginning in 1934, Associated Oil Company commissioned a series of photographs to be taken to record the progress of construction on the Golden Gate Bridge and San-Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge projects. The projects were of special interest to the Associated Oil Company because they provided Flying A Gasoline and Cycol Motor Oil almost entirely for the projects. Formation into Tidewater Associated Oil Company Getty acquired control of the Mission Corporation in 1937. The previous year, the Tide Water and Associated companies were dissolved to form the Tidewater Associated Oil Company.Walker's Manual of Pacific Coast Securities, 1937 Across the West Pacific service stations became \\"Associated Flying A\\" while stations in the East became \\"Tydol Flying A\\".

Characteristics indicate that these constructions were sedentary establishments. Lifestyles and social characteristics follow the Mesoamerican model. It is estimated that the site was abandoned around year 1000 CE. During the first millennium CE, Mesoamerica had its greatest boom. Sedentary groups inhabited the arid plains of Northern Mexico. Around the year 1000 CE, for unknown reasons sedentary groups left the region, so returned to the nomad cultures of the desert territory. This impacted the Mesoamerican environment: it is known (oral and pictorial tradition of the Postclassic) that there were frequent migrations from the North for 500 years before the Spanish invasion. As well as the claimed northern roots of the Toltec, Aztec and Pur√©pecha. Barajas may have been an intermediate point of these migrations. Northern Mexico has been studied by Pedro Armillas (1964, 1969), Braniff (1989, 1994). More recent archaeological has been made by France, with research periods in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Occupation Recent research shows that the area was occupied during the Epiclassical period (650‚Äì950 CE). Epoch during which the inhabitants were sedentary groups (farmers) and became an important population of the Baj√≠o. It is estimated that sedentary groups began the occupation of the area from the Mid-Classical Mesoamerican period (450‚Äì650 CE) and sites were abandoned in the late 10th century, in a generalized manner, a phenomenon consistent with the fall of northern Mesoamerica. Some traces indicate that sites were visited sporadically by the late Postclassical hunters of Pur√©pecha artifacts. Settlement and Social Organization  During the area apogee, hundreds of structures of various types and sizes were built, used andesite slabs for construction. Widely available in the area, was used for the construction of their religious and housing structures. The similarity of structures on neighboring hills was observed. This architectural feature indicates that sites in the area were part of a similar complex. Housing areas provide an indication of life in the Epiclassical. The majority of the inhabitants lived in rectangular houses, with interior spaces often divided in several rooms. The high slab walls, built on a terrace, with roofs built with perishable materials. Among the houses were free spaces, often with changes made by terraces, which were probably used for agriculture. The ruling class rooms were large and more complexes part of the housing units. The Site The zone includes approximately 15 different surrounding sites, among these are: Nogales The \\"Nogales\\" presumably was the main civic-ceremonial center, because it includes the most complex and monumental structures. Structures A1, A2 and A3 were excavated. Detected five levels of successive occupation by the abundant ceramic, radiocarbon dating allowed establishing a chronological sequence. This site was discovered in the early 1980s. Its constructors built a fortress in the north of the Protohistoric Pur√©pecha Kingdom (Zepeda 1988, S√°nchez Correa 1993). The architectural features of Nogales allow the assumption of an occupation during the epiclassical and early Postclassical period (700‚Äì1000 CE), it is suspected that Nogales could be related to the San Antonio site from Carupo (Michoacan) which presents at least one of the buildings with similar impressive buildings of the Chalchihuites culture (Faug√®re - Kalfon 1991, 1996). This last finding indeed raised an identity problem for the occupants of the Barajas massif and in general, the phenomena observed there. Group A Nogales Structures A1 y A2. Residential structures Group B Nogales, non-domestic buildings: a small altar was discovered (B4) located at the center of a ceremonial place ornamented with three impressive pyramidal structures. Group G Nogales, G9. A study was performed of funerary practices and biological characteristics of the massif populations. Investigation of structure G9 offered interesting information. It is a small artificial terrace that supports the damaged vestiges of a tile construction. The terrace fill had burials associated with Barajas phase: more or less complete remains of five primary funerals were discovered in 4 square meters. The best preserved funeral had the remains of an adult woman buried in a hole in dorsal decubitus with legs in extended position. This woman was buried with the bones of another adult (secondary probably), as well as a rich offerings consisting of ten ceramic vessels, an adornment made of small conch pearls were found at the waist and a plug, cut in the form of a token. Y√°cata El Angel The H2 structure has large buildings. These had divisions and several rooms. They were built around inner courtyards. They were normally associated with a structure whose central atrium was likely used as meeting space and funerals. Occasionally had a closed courtyard. Group C Y√°cata El √Ångel: patio and associated articles. El Moro Group D El Moro. Concentration of small wells built from slabs, extensively used. Casas Tapadas Group A Casas Tapadas. Excavated two small parts of structures, probably residential buildings, an underground structure was found. Los Toriles Some study work focused on the defensive site of the Toriles, the door in the wall was partially refurbished. Occupation Phases  Nogales Phase. 450‚Äì500 to 750 CE. Barajas Phase. 750 to 950 CE. Early Postclassical. 950 to 1100 CE. Late Posclassical. 1400 to 1521 CE. Early research carried out on the site and its surroundings have allowed obtaining an overview of the occupation of this area of the Lerma Valley. Firstly, the results confirm assumptions about the main Barajas occupation between 750 and 950 of our era, i.e. in an Epiclassical chronological position. Also show that the Barajas phase occupation was preceded and followed by well identifiable though modest occupations. In this context, the importance and the relative brevity of Barajas occupation raises many questions. The represented demographic expansion does not appear to be explained by the natural increase of previously present groups; it is tempting to consider a migratory phenomenon resulted in the colonization of the massif previously uninhabited. This migration could also result from people living nearby, in the form of consolidation or relocation of the habitat. It may correspond also to wider movements (as might be assumed by the appearance of ceramics, from the Altos de Jalisco region types). These two hypotheses are not incompatible.

Origins In the aftermath of the June‚ÄìSeptember 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Amin Gemayel, convinced that a strong and unified national defense force was a prerequisite to rebuilding the nation, announced plans to raise a 60,000-man army organized into twelve brigades (created from existing infantry regiments), trained and equipped by France and the United States.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 123. In late 1982, the 8th Infantry Regiment was therefore re- organized and expanded to a brigade group numbering 2,000 men, of whom 80% were Maronite Christians from the Akkar District of northern Lebanon, with the remaining 20% were Sunni Muslims, which became on January 1, 1983, the 8th Infantry Brigade. Emblem The Brigade's emblem consists of the following elements: *The Arabic numeral (8): represents the number of the Brigade. *The Cedar: symbolizing the immortality of Lebanon. *The Sword: symbolizing the firm right in confronting the enemy. *A lightning at the base: symbolizing the execution with lightning speed. *Armor: symbolizing the immunity in defending the country. *The Laurel: symbolizing the laurel that only grows amongst rocks at the highest mountain peaks, indicating the strength and steadiness of the Brigade. Structure and organization The new unit grew from an understrength battalion comprising three rifle companies to a fully equipped mechanized infantry brigade, capable of aligning a Headquarters' (HQ) battalion, an armoured battalion equipped with Panhard AML-90 armoured cars, AMX-13 light tanksZaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), p. 59. (replaced in the 1990s by T-55A tanks donated by Syria) and 34 US M48A5 main battle tanks (MBTs),Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), pp. 61-62.Kassis, 30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon (2003), p. 18. three mechanized infantry battalions (87th, 83rd and the other battalion designation is unknown) issued with 90 US M113 armored personnel carriers (APC)Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), pp. 56; 62. and an artillery battalion (85th) fielding eighteen US M114 155 mm howitzers, including a battery of twelve French Hotchkiss-Brandt TDA MO-120-RT-61 120mm towed heavy mortars. The brigade also fielded a logistics support battalion, equipped with liaison and transport vehicles such as US M151A2 jeeps, Land-Rover long wheelbase series III, Chevrolet C20 and Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups, plus US M35A2 2¬Ω-ton (6x6) military trucks. The Brigade's Headquarters was located at Rihaniyeh, in the Baabda District of East Beirut, whilst its units were stationed in the environs of the Ministry of Defense complex at Yarze, also located at Baabda. Combat history=The Lebanese Civil WarThe Mountain War 1983-1984= In 1983, Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) positions in the southern suburbs and western part of Beirut were occupied by the Druze. The 8th Brigade was deployed to recapture these positions by force. During this period, with the sudden withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from Mount Lebanon to the Southern Lebanese region, the pro-Syrian fighters mainly composed of Palestinian and Druze militias supported by Syrian army tanks and artillery stormed the Christian villages in the Bhamdoun and Chouf Districts, forcing their inhabitants to flee the atrocity while seeking refuge in the Christian town of Deir el-Kamar. The 8th Brigade was once again deployed to the Souk El Gharb ridge, to block the advancement of the pro-Syrian militias from reaching deeper into the Christian zones and threatening the ministry of Defense in Yarze, as well as, the Presidential Palace in Baabda. The 8th Brigade fiercely defended a 15 miles front, turning back numerous attempts to take over the remainder of the Christian zones. From 1983 through 1984, the 8th Brigade bore the brunt of the battles against Druze militias in Suq al Gharb and against leftist militias in West Beirut,Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 223. instigated by the Syrian government to promote its control over Lebanon amid the failure of Lebanese-Israeli peace talks. =The post-Chouf years 1984-1988= In June 1984, all parties agreed on an ultimate cease-fire, in order to form a national government. General Michel Aoun was named Army Commander; Colonel Salim Kallas, who achieved an outstanding performance as deputy chief of staff of the 8th Brigade, was appointed the new Brigade Commander. From 1984 to 1985, in the wake of a political Lebanese crisis, the Syrian government tried to impose constitutional amendments by using the pro-Syrian militias to infiltrate the lines of the autonomous Christian zones. The 8th Brigade's mission was to halt the Syrian government involvement and to stop pro-Syrian militias' attacks by defending the Christian zones. During the War of the Camps in May 1985, the 87th Infantry Battalion from the 8th Brigade supported their Shi'ite colleagues of the 6th Brigade and the Shia Muslim Amal militia against the pro-Arafat Palestinian camp militias in the battle for the control of the Sabra and Shatila and Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camps in West Beirut.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 158.Joe Stork, \\"The War of the Camps, The War of the Hostages\\" in MERIP Reports, No. 133. (June 1985), pp. 3‚Äì7, 22. On 15 January 1986, the 8th Brigade was ordered to contain the schismatic internal fighting inside the Lebanese Forces upon the signature of the so-called \\"Tripartite Accord\\" in Damascus by Elie Hobeika, the commander of the Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces militia, Walid Jumblatt of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party/People's Liberation Army (PSP/PLA), Nabih Berri of the Shia Muslim Amal Movement militia and the Syrian government. The deputy chief of the Lebanese forces Samir Geagea opposed the agreement and led a coup to remove Elie Hobeika from his command. Elie Hobeika conceded to hand over his authority to Samir Geagea and to leave the Christian zones. The 8th Brigade strived to safely remove Elie Hobeika and his men from their headquarters in East Beirut to the Ministry of Defense in Yarze, in order to be deported to the Christian town of Zahle in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley. After ten days of Elie Hobeika's deportation, fighters from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) militia supported by Syrian Army tanks and field artillery devastated the Lebanese Army positions on the Hills overlooking Bikfaya, the home town of President Amine Gemayel, in the Northern Matn district. The 8th Brigade was ordered to swiftly counterattack and block the SSNP militiamen from progressing deeper towards Bikfaya. After three days of fierce fighting, the Brigade stemmed the advance, restored the Army defensive lines, and drove the SSNP fighters back to their original positions in the Dhour El Choueir village. From 1986 to 1988, the 8th Brigade was once again deployed on the Souk El Gharb Front to face the resurging Druze PSP/PLA militia's hostilities backed up by Syrian Army tanks and artillery. The confrontation evolved into a costly war of attrition that placed a great strain on President Gemayel's government to accept a Syrian-mediated political deal. In November 1988, President Amine Gemayel's term in office ended without the election of a new President. Gemayel relinquished his authority to a transition government formed of the members of the \\"Army Supreme Military Council\\" headed by General Michel Aoun as Prime Minister. The Eight brigade was the strongest, best equipped, best trained, and most elite unit in the Lebanese Arm. It was regarded as loyal to the president and the government. it consisted of 2,000 men, about 80 percent of whom were Christians from the northern region of Akkar, with the remaining 20 percent Sunni Muslims. It included a mechanized battalion equipped with ninety US-made armored personnel carriers, an armored battalion with thirty-three US-made M-48 tanks, and an artillery battalion equipped with eighteen field artillery pieces. It was stationed at the Presidential Palace at Baabda and at the Ministry of Defense in the Yarze section of Beirut. =The Liberation War 1989-1990= On 14 March 1989, the internal political challenge to elect a President reached its climax, the Syrian threat widened its assault by striking hard on urban Christian-held areas. To halt the growing Syrian interference, General Aoun declared a \\"Liberation War\\". The 8th Brigade was charged to face any Syrian new involvement in the Christian zones. The fighting was disrupted by periods of calmness and a series of failed cease-fire and endless negotiations for peace settlements. In August 1989, in the midst of this restive period, the Army Command decided to pull out the 8th Brigade from the Souk El Gharb Front. On 13 August 1989, following three days of continuous Syrian shelling to suppress Lebanese Army defenses and its military facilities, large numbers of heavy-equipped Druze PSP/PLA fighters and leftist militias attacked the Souk el Gharb Front. The Druze PSP/PLA militia, reinforced by Soviet T-55A tanks and supported by heavy artillery, occupied the high ground of \\"Keyfoun's Fortress\\" and penetrated other parts of the Souk El Gharb Front while attempting to descend the ridge towards the Presidential Palace. The 8th Brigade was redeployed to restore the lines and to push out the Druze PSP/PLA's advancement. After a severe daylong battle, the Druze were demoralized by the on rushing 8th Brigade's infantry troops and armored units. The Druze fighters were \\"routed\\" in full flight out of the occupied areas and at five o'clock in the evening their defeat was total. Local and international Newspapers, Radio and TV stations blared out the news of this battle as a great victory for General Salim Kallas and his brave soldiers. =The Elimination War 1989-1990= In January 1990, upon the election of Elias Hraoui for Presidency according to the Taif Agreement, a struggle arose inside the Christian autonomous zones. Samir Geagea commander of the Lebanese forces intended to overthrow the antagonistic rival Prime Minister General Michel Aoun for refusing the Taif Agreement. In support of Prime Minister Michel Aoun, the 8th Brigade took control of the Southern and Northern parts of the Matn District from Samir Geagea's LF militia forces. As a result of the retreat of the Lebanese Forces to the Keserwan District, the 8th Brigade deployed its troops to defensive positions on a 30-mile separation front between the Northern Matn and the Keserwan. =The 13 October 1990 offensive and the end of the civil war= On 13 October 1990 the Syrian Army, given an international green light, invaded the last of the autonomous Lebanese zones controlled by Prime Minister General Michel Aoun in order to end his \\"Rebellion\\" and to put in office President Elias Hrawi. The latter was elected in November 1989, under the terms of the Taif Agreement signed and ratified by the Lebanese Parliament in an uncommon session held in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to end the Lebanese Civil War. Following the Syrian invasion, a political transition occurred, with Elias Hrawi assuming his full presidential authority, whilst General Aoun was exiled to France and General Salim Kallas was removed from his command on 16 November 1990. In conclusion, from 1983 to 1990, the 8th Brigade made its reputation in mounting offensive operations based on mobility, speed and surprise. The 8th Brigade won its fame in a string of victorious battles, where it suffered numerous casualties. General Salim Kallas proved great professional field experience and assertive skills in leading his troops to success. Throughout his command, his strategy was to maintain the Sovereignty, protect the integrity and bring peace to the Homeland. The post-civil war years 1990-present Upon the end of the war in October 1990, the 8th Brigade was re-integrated into the structure of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).

The mineral was found in an exposed ore dump, on the property of Consolidated Rambler Mines Limited near Baie Verte, Newfoundland. The mineral was first characterized by Ernest Henry Nickel, a mineralogist with the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources in Australia, in 1973. Cuprospinel is an inverse spinel with the formula CuFe2O4, where copper substitutes some of the iron cations in the structure. Its structure is similar to that of magnetite, Fe3O4, yet with slightly different chemical and physical properties due to the presence of copper. Structural properties Cuprospinel, like many other spinels has the general formula AB2O4. Yet, cuprospinel is an inverse spinel in that its A element, in this case copper (Cu2+), only occupies octahedral sites in the structure and the B element, iron (Fe2+ and Fe3+), is split between the octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the structure. The Fe2+ species will occupy some of the octahedral sites and there will only be Fe3+ at the tetrahedral sites. Cuprospinel adopts both cubic and tetragonal phases at room temperature, yet as temperature is elevated the cubic form is most stable. Magnetic properties CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were characterized as superparamagnetic materials with saturated magnetization of Ms=49 emu g‚àí1, remnant magnetization (Mr = 11.66 emu g‚àí1) and coercivity (Hc = 63.1 mT). The magnetic properties of CuFe2O4 have correlated the size of particles. Particularly, the decreasing in saturated magnetization and remanence correspond to the decreasing in the size of CuFe2O4, whereas the coercivity increases. Solid phase synthesis Spinel CuFe2O4 was synthesized by solid phase synthesis at high temperature. In a particular procedure for this type of synthesis, the stoichiometric mixture of Cu(CH3COO)2¬∑ and FeC2O2 was ground together and stirred in solvent. After evaporation of the solvent, the powder was heated in a furnace at constant temperature around 900 0C in air- atmosphere environment. Then the resulting mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature in order to obtain stable spinel structure. Hydrothermal Synthesis Hydrothermal method is widely known as an effective way to synthesize spinel oxide, especially for cooper iron oxide. Typically, NaOH was added dropwise to a solution of Fe3+(Fe(NO3)3 or Fe(acac)3) and Cu2+ (Cu(NO3)2 or CuCl2) in triethylene glycol at room temperature with constant stirring until a reddish-black precipitate formed completely. The resulting mixture was placed in an ultrasonic bath to mixing it well, followed by heating in a furnace at high temperature. Final products were then washed in diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol and deionized water, and then dried under vacuum to obtain oxide particles. Uses Cuprospinel is used in various industrial processes as a catalyst. An example is the water‚Äìgas shift reaction: : H2O(v) \\\\+ CO(g) ‚Üí CO2(g) \\\\+ H2(g) This reaction is particularly important for hydrogen production and enrichment. The interest of cuprospinel arises in that magnetite is a widely used catalyst for many industrial chemical reactions, such as the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process, the Haber‚ÄìBosch process and the water-gas shift reaction. It has been shown that doping magnetite with other elements gives it different chemical and physical properties; these different properties sometimes allow the catalyst to work more efficiently. As such, cuprospinel is essentially magnetite doped with copper and this enhances magnetite's water gas shift properties as a heterogeneous catalyst. Recyclable catalyst for organic reactions Recent years, various research towards the heterogeneous catalytic ability of CuFe2O4 in organic synthesis have been published ranging from traditional reactions to modern organometallic transformation. By taking advantages of magnetic nature, the catalyst can be separated simply by external magnetism, which can overcome the difficulty to separate nano-scaled metal catalyst from the reaction mixture. Particularly, only by applying magnetic bar at the outer vessel, the catalyst can easily be held at the edge of container while removing solution and washing particles. The obtained particles can be readily used for the next catalyst cycles. Moreover, the catalytic site can be exploited in either cooper or iron center because of the large-surface area of nanoparticles, leading to wide scope to apply this material in various types of reactions. Catalyst for Multi-component reaction (MCR) Nano CuFe2O4 was utilized as a catalyst in one-pot synthesis of fluorine containing spirohexahydropyrimidine derivatives. It was also observed that the catalyst can be reused five times without significant loss in catalytic activity after each runs. In the reaction, iron plays a vital role in coordination with carbonyl group in order to increase the electrophilic property, which can facilitate the reaction condition and increase reaction rate. One-pot synthesis of fluorine containing spirohexahydropyrimidine derivatives. Adapted from . Another example for MCR utilizing CuFe2O4 was published in a research towards the A3 coupling of aldehydes, amine with phenylacetylene to give the corresponding propargylamines. The catalyst can be reused three times without remarkable reduce in reaction yield. A3 coupling of aldehydes, amine with phenylacetylene. Adapted from . Catalyst for C-O cross coupling Pallapothula and coworkers demonstrated CuFe2O4 is an efficient catalyst for C-O cross-coupling between phenols and aryl halides. The catalyst exhibited superior activity in comparison with other nanoparticles oxides such as Co3O4, SnO2, Sb2O3. Moreover, the catalyst can benefit in applying C-O cross-coupling on alkyl alcohols, leading to widening scope for the transformation. :C-O cross-coupling between phenols and aryl halides. Adapted from . Catalyst for C-H activation Nano CuFe2O4 catalyst was demonstrated its activity for C-H activation in Mannich type reaction. In the mechanistic study, the copper play a significant role in both generate radical from TBHP and activate C-H from substituted alkyne. In this reaction, iron center was considered as a magnetic source and this hypothesis was proved by the experiment, in which magnetic Fe3O4 had been used but failed to catalyze reaction in the absence of copper center. :C-H activation in Mannich type reaction. Adapted from . Other reactions CuFe2O4 can also be applied for C-C cleavage Œ±-arylation between acetylacetone with iodobenzene. The phenylacetone product was obtained with excellent yield at 99% and 95% selectivity observed for principal product compared to 3-phenyl-2,4-pentanedione as the byproduct. The XRD results were observed that crystal structure of catalyst remained unchanged after the sixth run while catalytic activity slightly decreases at 97% conversion in the final run. In this reaction, the mechanistic study showed the catalytic cycle started from CuII to CuI and then oxidized to CuII by aryl iodine. Arylation between acetylacetone with iodobenzene. Adapted from . The role of copper has been further emphasized in the coupling reaction of ortho-arylated phenols and dialkylformamides. It was observed that there was a single-electron oxidative addition of copperII to copperIII through a radical step, then transformed back to copperI by reductive elimination in the presence of either oxygen or peroxide. Catalyst can be reused 9 times without significant loss in catalytic activities. Coupling reaction of ortho-arylated phenols and dialkylformamides. Adapted from . Synergistic effect of catalytic activity Notably, synergistic effect was demonstrated for the case of CuFe2O4 in Sonogashira reaction. Both Fe and Cu center contribute to catalytic activity of the transformation between aryl halide and substituted alkynes. The product was obtained with 70% yield in the presence of Nano CuFe2O4, while only 25% yield and <1% yield observed when using CuO and Fe3O4 respectively.

It is the tenth volume of Roberts's SPQR series, featuring Senator Decius Metellus. Plot summary Senator Decius Metellus has returned from his military expedition to Cyprus, having concluded a successful campaign against local pirates and gathered enough booty to pay off his outstanding debts and finance his campaign for praetor. He is campaigning in the Forum when a young aristocrat loudly denounces him for alleged fraud and theft while in office on Cyprus, and boldly threatening to prosecute him for said acts. A minor scuffle breaks out, before the young man is dragged away. Later, the young man is found gruesomely murdered, and suspicion falls on Decius. To his consternation, his family inform him that, although the charges are unlikely to stick, they can nevertheless delay his election for at least a year. Decius, thinking hard, realizes that the young man may have been a virtual nobody, but could recite a pedigree that would virtually guarantee him popular support - claiming descent from Scipio Africanus and the Gracchi, among others. This means that the young man was likely the figurehead of a conspiracy. The exact aim of the conspiracy is unclear, but Decius reasons that someone must be aiming at reducing the Caecilia Metelli's voting bloc in the Senate (as Decius concedes, he himself is not that important). Decius consults Sallustius, who gives him a small lecture about the Republic's political landscape: for generations, the great aristocratic families of Rome have been slowly shrinking, more dependent on adoption to sustain their numbers, and gradually losing their hold on the highest offices of state which they consider to be their birthright. Now, with Caesar's power, wealth, and popularity growing on a daily basis, these aristocrats are being pushed to increasingly desperate lengths. Sallust confides that he was a guest at several dinner parties at which schemes were discussed to seize control of the State; the young man was to have been the figurehead, and popular support was supposed to have been further mobilized by proposing a mass cancellation of debts. Of course, Sallust dismissed the scheme as hare-brained.

The conspiracy which Decius uncovers and thwarts is symptomatic of these ills: amateurishly planned, poorly executed, and born of a blinkered, reactionary mindset. Decius is profoundly depressed: he has always loathed and mistrusted Caesar as ambitious and unscrupulous, yet he cannot deny that he is far smarter and more capable than almost anyone in the Senate.

Joditz lies in the valley of the Saale, ten kilometers north- west of the town of Hof. The village has 345 inhabitants (as of January 2010) and contains a parish church. The area of the parish includes the hamlets Joditz, Lamitz, Saalenstein, Scharten, St√∂ckaten and Siebenhitz. At the centre of the village is St John's Evangelical Lutheran Church. It was first mentioned in 1365 and has been the parish church since 1561. The present structure was built in 1704. The pulpit, altar, organ case and baptismal font (the last no longer extant) were by the Hof sculptor Johann Knoll. The altarpiece depicts the birth of Christ, and is flanked by statues of Moses and John the Baptist. The altar is surmounted by three cherubs with the arms of the former patron families, and the pulpit is decorated with figures of the four evangelists. The church was renovated in 2002/2003. Jean Paul Joditz was the childhood home of the Wunsiedel-born writer Jean Paul, whose father was pastor from 1765 to 1776. In his autobiography he described the importance of the small town in his upbringing and his later literary work; he tells not only of his childhood joys, but also of the great superstitious fears he harboured, such as the fear of village ghosts. :Let not the poet place his birth and first years in a capital city, but wherever possible in a village, or at greatest a little town. The abundance and over-stimulation of a large city are, to the weak and excitable soul of a child, a meal made out of dessert, a drink of aqua ardens, and a bath of mulled wine. The character of the village schoolteacher Maria Wutz of Auenthal (in Jean Paul's eponymous idyll) is thought to be based on an inhabitant of Joditz. The Jean Paul Museum in Joditz keeps the memory of the writer and his childhood spent in Upper Franconia. In an idyllic rural setting, which includes the old rectory garden, the visitor can examine manuscripts, early prints, first editions, engravings, drawings and other documents. The museum is a private initiative, run by Eberhard and Karen Schmidt. Bibliography * August Gebessler. Stadt und Landkreis Hof, M√ºnchen 1960. S.43-45. * Die Johannes-Kirche zu Joditz.

She served on the North America and West Indies Station and surveyed parts of the Australian coast before being sold at Hong Kong in 1889. Design=Propulsion The first 6 ships had a 2-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine provided by Robert Napier and Sons and rated at 200 nominal horsepower, driving a single screw. Sylvia and Nassau were completed as survey ships and were powered by 150 nhp Humphreys and Tennant engines, and Myrmidon, the last of the completed Cormorants, received a more powerful 200 nhp Humphreys and Tennant engine. Armament The main armament, which was principally intended for shore bombardment, was originally designed with two 68-pounder and two 32-pounder muzzle-loading smoothbore guns. They were finished, however, with a single 7-inch/110-pounder Armstrong breech-loading gun and a 68-pounder muzzle- loading smoothbore gun. A pair of broadside 20-pounder Armstrong breech- loading guns were also fitted. The 68-pounders were later replaced by a pair of 64-pounder muzzle-loading rifled guns. Sail plan In common with all other Royal Navy wooden screw gunvessels, the Cormorants were rigged as barques, that is with three masts, with the fore and main masts square rigged, and the mizzen fore-and-aft rigged. Construction The first 6 ships were ordered from commercial yards (Money Wigram & Son, C J Mare & Co and J Scott Russell). A further batch of 4 ships (including Myrmidon) were ordered on 5 March 1860 and the final batch of 3 (Pegasus ‚Äì Guernsey) on 25 March 1862. The first completed ships had a draught of , exceeding the intended by a considerable margin. Since gunvessels were intended to work in shallow water while bombarding the shore, work on the later two batches was suspended. Sylvia, Nassau and Myrmidon were suspended in 1862 or 1863, but were resumed, being finished as survey vessels.Preston claims that Myrmidon was completed as a survey vessel; Winfield states only that she was a survey vessel by 1888. She was launched on 5 June 1867Bastock, p.91. and commissioned in October 1867. Operational service Myrmidon commenced service on the North America and West Indies Station. She served on the Australia Station from 14 March 1885 and undertook hydrographic surveys along the Australian coastline until she left the Australia Station in 1888. In April 1887 she was involved in a collison with the troopship HMS Tyne near Sydney. Fate She sailed to Hong Kong and was sold in April 1889 for ¬£3000. Her eventual fate is unknown.

Cobb character, the man \\"squeezed out by both big business and excessive labour demands and gansterism... also fettered by being Jewish, of which he was proud but also sub consciously angry since it interfered with his complete freedom due to the survival of some brands of anti-Semitism.\\"Aldrich p 14 Aldrich added that Lee J Cobb \\"was one of the sore points on that film. He had an old, long standing relationship with Harry Cohn; Cobb and I did not get along. He's a very strong willed actor - a wonderful actor but... That could have been a wonderful picture. It just ran out of guts in the middle.\\"Aldrich p 35 Aldrich said Cobb \\"didn't want to be a rough father. He didn't want to have people dislike him. And it was necessary for him to be a tough, miserable son of a bitch, not a good guy. So everyday someone or other would want me to soften the script.\\"Aldrich p 64 According to Sherman, \\"Aldrich and the producer were not getting along\\" and \\"neither one of them were getting along with Harry Cohn\\". Cohn asked Sherman to do \\"one or two scenes and I couldn't turn him down.\\" Sherman says Cohn then asked him to finish the picture. \\"I didn't know what the hell was going on,\\" said Sherman. \\"I re-shot, I would say, about seventy percent of the picture in about ten days time.\\" \\"That was a strange experience,\\" said Aldrich. \\"I don't remember another occasion of a guy getting fired for wanting to shoot the picture he'd been assigned. Usually, if you're fired, it's for wanting to change the script.\\"Interview with Robert Aldrich Greenberg, Joel. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 38, Iss. 1, (Winter 1968): 8. Aldrich says he never saw the final film but was told \\"about half or two thirds of it is mine\\". He may have seen it later because he said Sherman made it \\"very quiet and very mild; it became a love story, also about a father who wanted give his business to his son, all that bullshit.\\" Aldrich went on to sue Columbia for not financing Storm in the Sun, a film he wanted to make. The case settled out of court.AUDREY HEPBURN WEIGHS FILM ROLE: Actress Is Uncommitted on Offer to Star in 'Diary of Anne Frank' for Fox Gene Kelly Takes Over Of Local Origin By THOMAS M. PRYOR New York Times 1 May 1957: 41. Despite the firing Aldrich admired Cohn. \\"I think he ran a marvellous studio... I think he did it as well as anybody could do it... He wasn't in the money business he was in the movie business.\\" Aldrich says he had a chance to do other work for Cohn before the latter died but didn't go and \\"always regretted it.\\" See also * List of American films of 1957 ReferencesNotes * External links  * Category:1957 films Category:1957 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English- language films Category:Film noir Category:Films about the labor movement Category:Films directed by Vincent Sherman Category:Films directed by Robert Aldrich Category:Films scored by Leith Stevens Category:Films set in New York City ","title":"The Garment Jungle"},{"id":"29169461","text":"Popcycle was a Serbian pop rock band from Beƒçej, formed as a faction of the popular Serbian band Eva Braun.  History = Formation, rise to prominence (1994-1996)  The first signs of the band existence were noted in the magazine Ritam (Rhythm) on early Summer of 1994, where the rock journalist Bojana ≈Ωikic described the band as \\"Gordon Gano meets Stipe and Buckley\\". The band was formed by Eva Braun members Milan Glava≈°ki (guitar, vocals) and Ljubomir Rajiƒá (drums), who, having performed as a cover band under the stodgy name Gervasius Twinkleminkleson (the name of an Alan Ford comic book character), were joined by Goran Obradoviƒá (bass). While awaiting for the Eva Braun magnum opus, the album Pop music, featuring the song \\"Kopija\\" (\\"The Copy\\"), a hit song originally written for Popcycle, and dissatisfied with the atmosphere within group, the three focused their creativity on Popcycle, frequently performing live and gaining a loyal fan base. After the July 1996 performance at the Belgrade SKC rooftop, the original Eva Braun lineup disbanded. At the time, Popcycle recorded a promotional video for the song \\"Orbitalna putovanja\\" (\\"Orbital travellings\\"), a science fiction mini film directed by Uro≈° Stojanoviƒá, presenting the band to a wider audience. The band also signed a contract with Automatik Records through which the band their debut EP Orbitalna putovanja, released during the Summer of 1996, composed of five songs. The entire release featured Ljubomir Rajiƒá recording the keyboard sections on all tracks beside the drums. Being a conceptual release, united with the band inspiration with space as the main lyrical theme, the band wanted to present an authentic release influenced by the Beatles EP Magical Mystery Tour and the Idoli eponymous EP.  Lineup change, disbandment (1996-1999)  After the EP release, in October of the same year, the band was joined by a keyboard player and backing vocalist Nata≈°a Katiƒá, a former Mary Poppins member, becoming a quartet following the Suede influences. The new lineup had their first live appearance at the Serbian Independence Day movie premier, performing a cover version of the R.E.M. song \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\". The following year, the band entered the Belgrade Do-re-mi studio from February 9 until March 21 and made recordings produced by Predrag Pejiƒá and featuring guest appearances by De≈æe Molnar (saxophone), ≈Ωeljko ƒêurƒëevac (harmonica), Bela Farka≈° (saxophone), Vladimir Ne≈æiƒá (trombon) and Dragan Kozarƒçiƒá (trumpet). The material appeared on the debut album, Popcyclopedia, released by Automatik Records on May 1997. Composed of fourteen songs, including the tracks \\"Vilenjaci\\" (\\"The Elves\\"), for which a promotional video was recorded directed by Aca Iliƒá, \\"Vrli novi dan\\" (\\"Brave New Day\\") and \\"Ona zna\\" (\\"She Knows\\"), the band presented their vision of pop music combined with esoteric lyrics, influenced by at the time popular britpop music, which was praised by both the audience and the critics. During the same year, the song \\"Devojka iz svemira\\" (\\"A Girl From Outer Space\\"), originally released on Orbitalna putovanja, appeared on the various artists compilation Ovo je zemlja za nas?!? (This Is The Land For Us?!?), released by Radio BOOM 93 and B92. Two years later, in 1999, two songs from the second studio album, \\"Vilenjaci\\" (\\"The Elves\\") and \\"Leptiri\\" (\\"The Butterflies\\"), appeared on the Automatik Records various artists compilation Recordings. During the same year, the band recorded a cover version of the Split band Fit song \\"Zaboravit ƒáu sve\\" (\\"I Will Forget Everything\\"), originally released on the 1988 album Daj mi ruku (Give Me Your Hand), for the B92 various artists cover album Korak napred 2 koraka nazad (A Step Forward 2 Step Backwards). The recording, co-produced by the band with Jan ≈†a≈° and Du≈°an ≈†evarliƒá, featured guest appearances by producer ≈†evarliƒá and Veliki Prezir frontman Vladimir Kolariƒá on backing vocals. This was the last recording the band had made, as Popcycle disbanded due to Glava≈°ki and Obradoviƒá's return to Eva Braun.  One-off reunion (2007)  On May 4, 2007, the band reunited for a one-off show at the Milan Glava≈°ki solo concert, held at the Beƒçej club Penny Lane, performing their well-known songs, including \\"Dorian Gray\\", \\"Digitalni san\\" (\\"Digital Dream\\"), \\"Jo≈° malo\\" (\\"A Bit More\\"), \\"Od mene\\" (\\"From Me\\"), and \\"Orbitalna putovanja\\" (\\"Orbital Travellings\\").
