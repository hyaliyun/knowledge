These areas are the heartland of rugby league. The sport is also popular in Cumbria where the amateur game is particularly powerful. Name Within its Northern heartlands, rugby league is often referred to as \\"rugby\\", a term that in the rest of England would normally refer to rugby union, and occasionally as \\"football\\", which even in the North of England normally refers to association football.BBC ‚Äì Voices ‚Äì The Voices Recordings History Batley (left) vs St. Helens (right) =Foundations= Rugby has long been popular in the North of England and by the 1880s the region's clubs had come to dominate. The game was popular amongst working class people, unlike the clubs in Southern England whose players belonged to the middle or upper class. Rugby competition at the time did not allow paying players any wages; the working class players felt they could not afford time off to train and play, nor could they afford to miss work through injury sustained whilst playing. The principle of amateurism, and issues of class ensured that the Rugby Football Union would not countenance professional rugby. In August 1895, representatives of the northern clubs met at the George Hotel, Huddersfield to form the \\"Northern Rugby Football Union\\" (NRFU). The NRFU was initially vehemently anti- professional, allowing only payments for time missed from other employment. A thriving amateur scene also soon developed, as local amateur clubs wished to maintain links with their \\"Northern Union\\" neighbours. The Northern Union made reforms to the laws in 1897 and again in 1906 in an effort make the game more exciting. This resulted in Northern Union football becoming a sport in its own right rather than a form of rugby union. The sport spread outside England and soon international matches began to be played. The first international match was played in 1904 as England was beaten 9‚Äì3 at Central Park, Wigan by \\"Other Nationalities\\" (largely Welsh players). This was followed by a tour of Britain by New Zealand in 1907. New Zealand met Great Britain in Great Britain's first ever Test match at Headingley, Leeds on 18 January 1908. The same year the first Australian Kangaroos tourists visited Britain. In 1910 the first British tour to Australia and New Zealand took place. The Challenge Cup began in 1897 with Batley beating St Helens to win the first title. The final was first broadcast by BBC radio in 1927. The Wembley tradition was started in 1929 when Wigan beat Dewsbury 13‚Äì2 at the first Rugby League Challenge Cup to be held at Wembley. Rugby league continued to be played throughout the 1914‚Äì15 season, however, the loss of players to the First World War, a government ban on professionalism and reduced attendances forced all major competitions to be replaced by regional competitions. The NRFU became the Rugby Football League in 1922. The 1930s saw a series of failed attempts to introduce rugby league football to London. During the Second World War professional rugby league was again discontinued, normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel. =Post-war= In 1948 the first televised rugby league match was played when Wigan's 8‚Äì3 Challenge Cup Final victory over Bradford Northern was broadcast to the Midlands. In another first this was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, King George VI, who presented the trophy. Several attempts were made to expand the game outside the heartlands, a Southern Amateur Rugby League being formed in 1949, however only Cumberland and southern areas of the West Riding of Yorkshire proved receptive with teams being founded in Workington, Whitehaven and Doncaster. Nonetheless the game survived, and continued to maintain popularity in its home regions. The introduction of regular internationals as other countries took up the sport provided a fillip. Rugby league experienced a surge in interest following the end of the Second World War. Large crowds came to be the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in 1949‚Äì50, when over 69.8 million paying customers attended all matches. The 1953‚Äì54 Challenge Cup Final replay between Halifax and Warrington, held at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, drew 102,575 paying spectators with an estimated 20,000 others getting in free after a section of fencing collapsed. The boom had begun to subside by the early 1960s; rugby league now had to compete against television and other new forms of entertainment and attendances began to fall. David Attenborough, then controller of BBC2, made the decision to screen games from a new competition the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy in 1965. It proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since. Attendances fell even further in the 1970s. Britain won the Ashes for the last time in 1970, with a 2‚Äì1 series win in Australia. The foundation of the Universities and Colleges Rugby League in 1969 and the British Amateur Rugby League Association in 1973 was a response to the need to develop the game below professional level. =1980‚Äì1990= Leeds playing at the 2008 Boxing Day friendly against Wakefield Trinity at Headingley, Leeds In June 1980, Fulham F.C. announced the formation of a rugby league team, with the primary intention of creating another income stream for the association football club. The Rugby Football League was keen to expand outside the heartlands and accepted the new club (now known as London Broncos). This was not the first rugby league club to be based in London‚Äîthree London-based clubs had come and gone in the 1930s. However unlike the past ventures the new team survived despite several moves and name changes, and as London Broncos are currently playing in the top division of the game in the U.K. The 1982 Kangaroos won all their tour games for first time ever, they became known as \\"The Invincibles\\". This was the time when the gap between English and Australian rugby league became apparent and has never been fully closed. The All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group was formed in 1987 to support the sport of rugby league and tackle the key issues facing the game in Parliament. Ian McCartney MP was the first chairman and David Hinchliffe MP the secretary. In 1987 a \\"free gangway\\" between the two codes of rugby at amateur level was introduced but individual cases of discrimination continued, resulting in the Sports (Discrimination) Bill, which was introduced by David Hinchcliffe in 1994. In the mid 1980s Wigan began an era of domination of English rugby league that would end only with the formation of Super League. By 1995 they had won the Challenge Cup a record eight consecutive times and the league title for a record seven consecutive times. The traditional Origin series between Yorkshire and Lancashire was abandoned in 1989. Although the matches had provided a good test for selecting players for the full England and Great Britain sides, the crowds had been poor and the games had little attraction for the rest of the country. The series was revived again in 2001 before being abandoned in 2003. The Combined Services Rugby League (CSRL) was formed in 1994 after the official recognition of rugby league by the armed services, since then rugby league has been the fastest growing army sport. The rival code rugby union went professional in 1995 and, as a result, other restrictions on rugby league were relaxed by the Rugby Football Union. This opened up the possibility of expanding the game into areas where it had never been played before as it allowed rugby league clubs to groundshare with rugby union clubs and for union players to try out the other code without fear of persecution. =1995‚Äìpresent: Summer era= The final home Test for Great Britain against New Zealand in 2007 In 1995, the fallout from the Super League war hit Britain, and the game underwent massive re-organisation. A new elite league, Super League was formed, and the sport switched from a winter to a summer season. Super League has largely been a success as the value of its TV contract and top tier game crowd attendances and have both grown year upon year since 2001. The Rugby League Conference was founded in 1998 with the aim of providing regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the 'heartland' of rugby league. It began with fourteen teams, but within nine years had grown to eighty-eight clubs spread throughout England and the rest of Britain. Governing bodies =Rugby Football League= The Rugby Football League (RFL) is the governing body for the sport in England. Previously, before the emergence of Wales Rugby League, Scotland Rugby League and Rugby League Ireland the RFL had control over the whole United Kingdom. The RFL are affiliated with the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) and the Rugby League European Federation (RLEF). The Community Board is made up of representatives of the RFL, BARLA, Combined Services, English Schools Rugby League and Student Rugby League. =British Amateur Rugby League Association= British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) are responsible for amateur rugby league chiefly in the sport's north of England heartlands. Though many Rugby League Conference teams are affiliated to BARLA, the Conference itself is not a BARLA organisation. The top division under their control is the National Conference League, with regional leagues including the North West Counties and Pennine leagues. BARLA selects an international team consisting of amateur players, the BARLA Lions. This team tours many parts of the rugby league world, and have competed in the Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament. =Armed Forces= Rugby league was recognised as a military sport in 1994. The Combined Services Rugby League (CSRL) is the co-ordinating group for the Army Rugby League, Royal Navy Rugby League and the Royal Air Force Rugby League. Each constituent body organises its own competitions at unit and formation level. Players are fed into representative teams to represent each of the services, and the best players are selected to represent the Combined Services. =Women's Amateur Rugby League Association= The Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (WARLA) is the governing body of female rugby league in the United Kingdom; it currently falls under the Rugby Football League association which oversees its running and management. It was originally established in 1985 and was recognised by the RFL in its first year. =Touch Rugby League= Touch rugby is governed by the ETA who are supported by the Federation of International Touch and are affiliate members of the Rugby Football Union. They are not affiliated to the RFL or BARLA. During the early months of 2010, Tony Fretwell set up Great Britain Teachers' Rugby League for qualified teachers who were interested in playing representative rugby league. Teachers' Rugby League are supported by the NASUWT teaching union and the Rugby League Foundation. Open age competitions 2017 Super League Grand Final between Castleford Tigers and Leeds Rhinos, hosted at Old Trafford =Super League= Super League is the top league for the game in Europe; eleven of the twelve teams are based in England. It is the only full-time professional rugby league competition operating in the Northern Hemisphere. The French team Paris Saint-Germain competed in the first Super League season but folded in 1999. French presence was re-established in 2006 when Catalans Dragons were admitted to Super League. In 2009, Super League added Celtic Crusaders from Wales, which renamed themselves Crusaders Rugby League after that season; that team effectively folded after the 2011 season. The winner of the league is awarded the League Leaders' Shield whilst the overall winner of Super League is determined by play-offs and a grand final. The winner of the Super League plays the winner of the Australian NRL competition in the World Club Challenge. =Championship and League 1= Below Super League, there are the Championship and League 1. The Championship currently has 12 clubs and League 1 has 16. The 2015 season marked the return of a promotion and relegation system between Super League and the Championship; from 2009 through to 2014 promotion between the Championship and Super League had been on a licensed, or franchised, basis. Promotion and relegation between the leagues now known as the Championship and League 1 has long existed, including during the 2009‚Äì14 period. Following the 2014 season, the professional leagues underwent a major reorganisation. Super League and the Championship were both reduced from 14 clubs to 12, and League 1 was expanded from nine clubs to 14. The season structures of both Super League and the Championship were radically changed, and that of League 1 was more modestly changed. Wales became represented in the Championships starting in 2010 with the entry of South Wales Scorpions into League 1 and North Wales Crusaders in 2012. Toulouse Olympique of France played in the Championship in the past, and returned to the British league system in 2016, initially playing in League 1 and now in the Championship. The Toronto Wolfpack from Canada joined League 1 in 2017 and won the title in its inaugural season, thereby earning promotion to the Championship for 2018. All other clubs in both divisions are based in England, and of these, only London Broncos of the Championship and Newcastle Thunder, London Skolars, Gloucestershire All Golds, Hemel Stags, Coventry Bears and Oxford Rugby League of League 1 are based outside the heartlands. =Challenge Cup= The Rugby League Challenge Cup remains as a knock-out competition, though entry has now been expanded to make it a pan-European tournament bringing in teams from France, Canada and the rest of the UK; Russian teams have previously featured. Amateur teams also have the chance to participate in the Challenge Cup and have been victorious over several Championship sides. =National Conference League= BARLA administer different amateur competitions which traditionally ran throughout the winter in the heartlands but have mostly switched over to a summer season. The leading competition is the National Conference League which consists of four divisions (Premier Division, Division One, Division Two and Division Three) of up to 14 teams each. Other major amateur leagues include the Yorkshire Men's League, North West Men's League, Pennine League, Cumberland League, Barrow & District League and the Hull & District League. Teams from these regional leagues can apply for election to the National Conference League if they meet minimum criteria. The Rugby League Conference, which ran until 2011, was mostly composed of teams outside the heartlands. It has subsequently been replaced by a series of regional leagues across England, Scotland and Wales. Successor leagues in England include: Conference League South, Midlands Rugby League, North East Rugby League, South West Rugby League, East Men's League, South Premier, London & South East Men's League. =Defunct competitions= At various times English clubs have either competed in a national Championship with a Second Division and sometimes a Third Division as well or had separate county leagues for Yorkshire and Lancashire. There were also county cups for Yorkshire and Lancashire between 1905 and 1993. The Regal Trophy and BBC2 Floodlit Trophy were two other knock-out tournaments. A Trans-Pennine Cup was played for a short-time but it was replaced by the National League Cup. The Rugby League Charity Shield was a one-off match at the beginning of each season between 1985 and 1995. It was contested by the Champions and the holders of the Challenge Cup. The rugby union county championship was continued as a rugby league County Championship after the 1895 great schism. Teams representing Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumberland / Cumbria and sometimes Cheshire and Northumberland & Durham took part in the championship. This continued as the Rugby League War of the Roses played between Yorkshire and Lancashire. The Championship Cup was a cup competition for the Championship and Championship 1 (now League 1). Player awards The main two awards are the Lance Todd Trophy which is awarded to the Man-of-the-Match in the Challenge Cup Final whether on the winning or losing side and the Man of Steel Award which is the annual award for the best player in Super League. The Albert Goldthorpe Medal is an award that has been created by Rugby Leaguer & League Express to honour the leading players in Super League. The Rugby League World Golden Boot Award is given to the international player of the year, as determined by a ballot of international rugby league writers and broadcasters. Until 2007, this was accompanied by the RLIF Awards which rewarded the best referee, coach, developing nations player, international newcomer, captain and a team of the year. Derbies Many of the professional teams are separated by only a few miles but not all matches between teams from the same traditional county are considered derbies. There has been some debate as to whether St. Helens versus Wigan or Bradford versus Leeds is the biggest derby in English rugby league but there is only one same city derby in the Super League ‚Äì Hull F.C. v Hull Kingston Rovers. Some of the teams involved no longer play in the same league and so derby games are either arranged as pre-season friendlies or take place as part of the Challenge Cup. Junior rugby league Rugby league is played at a school level in many schools in the heartlands; recently it has been introduced into some schools outside the traditional areas in particular in London and Hertfordshire. The RFL uses two modified forms of rugby league created by ARL Development in Australia. Mini league (known as mini footy in Australia) is played by all children up to Year 4 of Primary School. It is designed to provide children with a safe environment, a firm knowledge of the laws of rugby league and a chance to practice the skills such as tackling, passing and common defensive and attacking tactics. Players up to and including Year 6 of Primary School play mod league. Mod league is a bridge between mini league and full contact rugby league. On completion of mod league, players make a move to full international rugby league laws. The Champion Schools tournament is a national competition for secondary schools. In the 2005/06 academic year over 1,200 teams and 20,000 players competed in the Champion Schools tournament, making it the largest rugby league competition in the world. Eighty percent of participants are new to rugby league. The growth of the Champion Schools tournament led to the creation of the Carnegie Champion Colleges competition for Years 12 and 13. The regionally based competition was introduced in 2008 and started in January.\\"Carnegie Champion Schools\\" , The Rugby Football League, 13 May 2007 British Amateur Rugby League Association runs the Gilette National Youth League as well as the Yorkshire combination, Hull Youth and Junior and London Junior League. Super League and National League teams run academy sides to develop young talent. Players under the age of 21 years are eligible to play for the senior academy, the rules also permit three players over the age of 21 to play in academy matches. Junior academies are the second tier in the Youth Development system. Only players under the age of 18 years are eligible to play for the junior academy; no players over the age limit are allowed to play. Some of the better junior academy players may get experience in the senior academy and it is not uncommon for some players to play regularly in both junior and senior academies. Student Rugby League Although the game remains close to its working class origins, changes in social demographics and attitudes have allowed many working-class people to attend university where they have continued their association with the game. The Student Rugby League was founded in 1967 when a team was created at Leeds University by Andrew Cudbertson, Jack Abernathy and Cec Thompson, other teams soon joined in areas of the United Kingdom which lay outside of the games traditional heartlands. The first university game was between Leeds and Liverpool in 1968. A year later the Universities and Colleges Rugby League was formed after student pioneers fought hard to get the sport recognised in higher education. The first Oxford versus Cambridge University match took place in 1981. The varsity match has \\"discretionary full blue\\" status. The game is now played in over 70 universities. Rugby league in universities has been an important vehicle for expansion of the game as players from outside the heartlands often first began to play at university level. Many continue to play after leaving university and this has led to the creation of teams in non-traditional areas such as London Skolars and Gloucestershire All Golds. Derivatives of rugby league London Griffins Winners 2006 Sheffield IMBRL 7s Rugby league sevens is particularly popular with pub teams drawn from the regulars at a pub; it is often difficult for a single public house to form a full squad of 13 players and 4 substitutes. Rugby league nines is the more common form of the shortened version of the game. The Carnegie Floodlit Nines, Middlesex 9s and the York International 9s are three of the best known rugby league nines tournaments in England. The York nines began in 2002 and the Middlesex nines a year later. All three competitions feature professional and amateur teams from England as well as teams from abroad. Touch Rugby is administered by Rugby Football League through a product known as Play Touch Rugby League. Try Tag Rugby are the RFL's official Tag Rugby League partners, running leagues in London, Yorkshire and the Thames Valley. Wheelchair rugby league was first introduced to England in 2005. The first competitive league began in 2009. Masters Rugby League which uses modified rules to allow older players to continue playing has only recently arrived in England and is not widely played. Stadiums There a 36 stadiums in stadiums considered to be rugby league stadiums, most of these are shared with association football teams. The largest club venue is the Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford Bulls, and has a capacity of 27,500. There is no national stadium for rugby league in England, however Wembley Stadium, Old Trafford, Olympic Park, and Elland Road are most commonly used for home England matches. Wembley is also the venue of the Challenge Cup Final, and Old Trafford the venue of the Super League Grand Final. The Super League's Magic Weekend is used to promote rugby league to a wider audience. The Millennium Stadium, Murrayfield, Etihad Stadium, St James' Park, and Anfield have all be used to host the event. Popularity English rugby league fans during the 2008 Rugby League World Cup Rugby league is one of a number of sports vying for second place to Association football in England. Historically, rugby league has been the second biggest spectator sport in England with 6.8 million spectators attending the 1948‚Äì1949 English season. The MORI Sports Tracker consistently reports that rugby league interests around 15% of British adults. It was the fourth most popular team sport in the February 2005 list behind football, cricket and rugby union; 12% of British adults watched it regularly. Rugby league is most popular in its traditional heartlands and, in those areas, interest in the sport can rival that of association football. Many large towns with rugby league traditions do not have football teams as a result of the monopoly on local interest: these towns include, Keighley, Castleford, Dewsbury, Batley and Wakefield. The regions in which rugby league is played most are Cumbria, where the amateur version has a high participation rate, former traditional Lancashire regions Merseyside and Greater Manchester, Yorkshire and Cheshire. There is also significant schools participation in London. Many of the professional and semi-professional teams are connected by the M62 motorway and so the term \\"M62 corridor\\" is sometimes used to refer to the area where rugby league is most popular. An old survey from 1994 showed that back then, sixty per cent of people regularly attending rugby league lived in only four postal districts along the M62. The sport has since launched several expansion teams in the south. Cougar Park in 2007: Keighley versus Featherstone Rovers Fifty per cent of viewers who watch rugby league on Sky Sports live in the South of England. Over 40% of active rugby league supporters are female. At the beginning of the 2006 season there were between thirty and forty female-only rugby league clubs running in England, not including clubs that have teams of both sexes. The majority of these clubs are located in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Rugby league has for much of its history been banned in the armed forces and in many schools and universities, further stifling growth. These barriers have largely been dismantled since professionalisation of rugby union. In 2004 the Rugby Football League reported 62,463 registered players (this is a UK-wide figure). However, in 2008, the RFL noted that there were only 2,000 registered club players aged 30 or over. In contrast, with centralisation and streamlining efforts in regard to the governance of the sport throughout the UK since 2004, the inclusion of Rugby League players from the British Amateur Rugby League Association, the Rugby League Conference, plus the Student Rugby League and the Military Rugby League, the Rugby Football League as at 2011, now reports a player registration rate nearing 300,000. This figure rivals the participation rate for the sport in Australia. The 2006 Super League generated the highest weekly average attendance in the 11-year history of the competition. The average weekly attendance for the regular season stood at 9,026, generated by an aggregate attendance of 1,516,342 supporters. This is an increase on the 2005 season average of 8,887. The attendances are not evenly spread between clubs within Super League; whilst the best supported team, Leeds with average gates of 15,683, a couple of clubs failed to attract averages of above 5,000. Crowds at matches below the top flight can exceed 3,500, however most of the clubs in this division have attendances lower than this. Although attendances outside Super League can be quite low, many of the teams play in small towns and the attendance figures represent a large percentage of the local population; as far down as amateur level. An example is Saddleworth Rangers which represents a largely rural area to the East of Oldham towards the Pennines; however the club's stadium contains a covered seated stand and triple figure support for home games. =Current trends= The success of Super League in England and the return of competitive international matches with Australia and New Zealand have seen growth for the sport. The ending of discrimination against rugby league resulting from professionalism in rugby union led to an increase in numbers in the amateur game, with many rugby union amateurs keen to try out the other code. In 2004 the Rugby Football League was able to report a 94% increase in registered players in just two years, whilst attendance figures for Super League matches rose 8% from the 2003 season. The annual Champion Schools competition from 2003 onwards has increased the number of school teams from 300 to 1,500 and the participation levels to 25,000 from 6,000. Though these figures include participants from Wales. The number of participants involved in the 2011‚Äì12 Carnegie Champion schools tournament was a record 30,713 players across 1819 teams making it the largest rugby league competition in the world. Whilst rugby union was officially an amateur sport, many rugby union players came to play rugby league. In recent years this trend has reversed and some rugby league players have crossed codes to play union. Expansion by the governing body, the Rugby Football League sees continual growth in the south of England, notably the London area, which now boasts three professional clubs. These are, London Broncos, London Skolars and Hemel Stags. One of the prime vehicles for expansion has been the Rugby League Conference, a set of competitions for clubs in those development areas. Rugby league and diversity Rugby league has had a tradition of being inclusive and for some notable firsts in terms of black participation. Professional black players first took to the professional rugby league pitch prior to the First World War. George Bennett became the first black player to play for Great Britain while it was another 44 years before Viv Anderson became the first black footballer to play association football for England. Clive Sullivan became the first black captain of the Great Britain team in 1972, 21 years before Paul Ince became the first black captain of England's association football team. Roy Francis was the first black coach of a leading club, almost half a century before the top flight of English association football would have a black British manager, a milestone also achieved by Ince (on 22 June 2008). Ellery Hanley earned the distinction of being the first black coach of any British national sporting team when he took charge of Great Britain in the home Ashes series of 1994. In 1997 the Rugby Football League launched a thirteen-point action plan aimed at tackling racism and encouraging the development of rugby league in Asian and black communities. Despite the sport being popular in West Yorkshire and the North West, which both have large South Asian communities, the sport has little following amongst South Asian communities. The British Asian Rugby Association (BARA) was set up in 2004 to encouraging participation in rugby among British Asians. In 2012, the Rugby Football League were awarded the Stonewall Sport Award in recognition of their work in embracing inclusivity and tackling homophobia. They also became the first UK sporting organisation to make the top 100 employers in the Stonewall Index that measures attitudes towards lesbian, gay and bisexual staff. Media =Publications= In 1989 George Moorhouse's At the George was shortlisted for the inaugural William Hill Sports Book of the Year. There are two weekly rugby league newspapers, Rugby Leaguer & League Express with around 23,000 subscribers and League Weekly with around 11,000 subscribers. In and around the heartlands, these publications are stocked in newsagents but in the rest of England they are only available via subscription. There are also two monthly magazines, Rugby League World and Forty-20, which can be bought throughout the UK. The Rugby League Journal appears quarterly. =Television= BBC Sport own the rights to broadcast a highlights package called the Super League Show which is broadcast commonly on the Monday night on BBC One, however only in the North West England, Yorkshire and North East England BBC television regions. Since 2008 however it has been repeated on BBC Two nationally as well as the regional broadcast on BBC One. End of season play-offs are shown across the whole country in a highlights package. The BBC covers the Rugby League Challenge Cup from the rounds in which the top clubs enter with the final attracting over 4 million viewers. The Challenge Cup final is considered by government to constitute a \\"listed event\\" which must be shown by a free-to-air channel available to at least 95% of the UK population. Sky has the rights to show live Super League games; one or two live matches are broadcast often fronted by Mike Stephenson and Eddie Hemmings. Live Super League broadcasts regularly rank amongst the top 10 most watched programmes in a week on Sky Sports with more than 250,000 viewers. Highlights are shown on Boots N' All which is shown on Sky Sports and is rebroadcast on the Internet. Sky also hold the rights to show the Rugby League Tri-Nations live, whilst highlights are shown on BBC Sport. Premier Sports shows 150 live games from Australia's National Rugby League. Five matches from the 2011 Student Rugby League Super 8 were televised live on Premier Sports. The Australian State of Origin series is currently shown on Sky. The current TV rights deal for Engage Superleague is worth approximately 50 million pounds over 3 years, beginning from 2009. =Radio= BBC Radio Five Live and BBC Five Live Sports Extra carry commentary from a selection of Super League matches each week, while BBC local radio also broadcasts throughout the season. *BBC London 94.9 covers London Broncos and London Skolars. *BBC Radio Cumbria report on Barrow, Whitehaven and Workington Town throughout the season as well as the local amateur scene throughout their season on The Rugby League Show. *BBC Radio Humberside broadcasts both Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers matches on The Oval Ball and does simultaneous broadcasts when games clash. *BBC Radio Leeds covers Leeds, Hunslet, Keighley, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Batley, Dewsbury, Castleford, Wakefield Trinity and Featherstone Rovers. *BBC Radio Sheffield covers Sheffield Eagles and Doncaster *BBC Radio York cover York City Knights *BBC Radio Manchester covers Wigan, Warrington, Leigh, Oldham, Salford, Swinton and Rochdale Hornets. *BBC Radio Merseyside gives live commentary of St. Helens, Widnes and Warrington.

The plot revolves around Alf Scodger‚Äôs attempts to outwit his overbearing wife. As a consequence, he accidentally discovers a talent for rugby and turns out for his local Yorcaster club against Lancastrian rivals Oldcastle.Rugby Reloaded ‚Äî Tony Collins The 1963 film, This Sporting Life, is set around the life of a professional rugby league footballer, Frank Machin, whose romantic life is not as successful as his sporting life. The film stars Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, Alan Badel and William Hartnell. It is considered to be one of the last major films of the British New Wave or \\"Free Cinema\\" movement. Many of the scenes in This Sporting Life were filmed at Wakefield Trinity's Belle Vue stadium and include some Trinity players and coaching staff (Ken Traill) in the background. The highly acclaimed play, Up 'n' Under was made as a film in 1998. As a comedy set in the north of England that features a bunch of losers, it has been compared to The Full Monty and Brassed Off. The film stars Samantha Janus, Gary Olsen, Neil Morrissey, Brian Glover, Griff Rhys Jones and Tony Slattery. The play was recently revived on stage with England rugby union star Gareth Chilcott in the Gary Olsen role. The film follows the story of an inept pub team in a rugby league sevens competition. =Plays= The Changing Room is a 1971 play by David Storey, set in a men's changing room before, during and after a rugby league game. It premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in 1971. The 1973 Broadway production, directed by Michael Rudman, won several awards including the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for Best Play and the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor for John Lithgow. Trinity Tales or The Road to Wembley, loosely based on Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, was performed by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company in 1975. It was later adapted into a television series and shown on BBC2. Up 'n' Under is a comedy by English playwright John Godber, first staged at the Hull Truck Theatre in 1984. It won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy that same year. The sequel, Up 'n' Under II, followed in 1985. Mick Martin's play Broken Time is the first dramatic treatment of the historic events that led to the 1895 great schism. National teams =England= The current England team jersey On 5 April 1904, England played their first game, losing 9‚Äì3 to Other Nationalities in a 12-a-side match at Wigan. With the exception of the 1995 World Cup, matches involving England were not deemed to have Test status, which applied only to the full Great Britain side. Usually the nation of England was represented by Great Britain in international tournaments, but for the 1975, 1995, 2000, 2008, 2013 and 2017 World Cups, England, along with other Home Nations, took part in their own right. However, unlike Great Britain, an England side has never won the World Cup. Between 1935 and 2004 they also competed in the European Nations Cup. In recent years they had come to dominate this tournament, and in 2005 they withdrew to level the playing field. They also took part in the World Sevens (2002, 2003). England currently take part in the Rugby League Tri-Nations and play an International Origin series against overseas players based in the Super League. There has also been an England A and England \\"Lionhearts team selected since 2002. The England A team is selected from up and coming players who are not yet ready for selection in the Great Britain team. England Lionhearts are selected from players in the Rugby League Conference. They compete against Wales A, Scotland A \\"Bravehearts\\" and Ireland A \\"Wolfhounds\\" each year in the Amateur Four Nations competition. =Great Britain= The Great Britain side is also referred to as \\"the Lions\\" or \\"the British Lions\\". At international level the Women's Great Britain side is commonly referred to as the Great Britain Lionesses. England has historically provided the vast majority of players for the Great Britain team, one of the major national teams playing rugby league. They compete against Australia for the Ashes, and New Zealand for the Baskerville Shield. The first Great Britain game took place on 18 January 1908 when they beat New Zealand 14‚Äì6 at Headingley. Great Britain took part in the 1954, 1957, 1960, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1977, 1985‚Äì1988 and 1989‚Äì1992 World Cups. They won a total of three World Cups; in 1954, 1960 and 1972. Great Britain also played in the 1999, 2004, 2005 and 2006 Tri-Nations against New Zealand and Australia. Although Great Britain never won the Tri- Nations, they finished top of the table in 2005 but lost to Australia in the final. In 2007 Great Britain was replaced by separate England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales teams; thereafter, Great Britain will only play on special occasions and tours.

He was formerly senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center and is one of the more prominent advocates for a strict system of federal gun control in the United States. Biography His father was born in Mexico but emigrated to the United States in his teens, becoming a career soldier but spending most of his time in the military as a bandleader. Tom Diaz is a graduate of the University of Florida and the Georgetown University Law Center, where he was an editor of the Law Journal. He has been in private and government practice since 1972. He was a gun enthusiast and NRA member until while working as a Congressional staffer he did research on gun legislation and interviewed victims of gun violence. Mr. Diaz was counsel to the Congressional House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice from August 1993 to January 1997. During that time, he was the lead Democratic counsel in the House on firearms and terrorism, but worked on a range of other issues. Diaz was assistant managing editor of The Washington Times from 1985 to 1991. From 1991 to 1993 he worked at a think tank specializing in international organized crime and counter-terrorism. From 1993 to 1997 he was the lead Democratic counsel on counterterrorism and firearms issues for the Crime Subcommittee of the U.S. House of representatives, helping to conduct fact- finding hearings and write key antiterrorism and gun control legislation. He was also the lead Democratic counsel during 10 days of intensive House hearings in 1995 on the events at the Branch Davidian church in Waco, Texas in 1993. Views Diaz has written numerous monographs on the proliferation of firearms in the United States and on the impact of the easy availability of specific classes of firearms on gun crime, death and injury in the United States. He has appeared on numerous television and radio media outlets, has been written about and quoted in print media, and his op-eds have been widely published. He has charged that the gun industry uses claims of increased lethality to increase sales. David Corn wrote: :In his book Making a Killing: The Business of Guns in America, Tom Diaz, a former NRA member and competitive shooter who became a gun control activist, shows that the gun industry in recent years responded to flat sales by producing increasingly deadly guns. But the gun culture‚Äîcentered on a device that enables lethal violence ‚Äî is not part of the right‚Äôs \\"culture of death.\\" He has also pointed to the way the NRA and gun industry use violent movies and images of death to promote firearms, claiming that the NRA's National Firearms Museum exhibits weapons used in notorious on-screen murders. He claims the NRA promoted concealed carry laws to help sell additional smaller firearms to people. He has been the backing behind the campaign to ban rifles chambered in .50 BMG. Diaz is known for his public policy stances that eschew the incremental political approach taken by others in the gun control community, such as Americans for Gun Safety and the American Hunters and Shooters Association. For example, Diaz openly stated that the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban would not have any impact on violent crime statistics and that it only affected cosmetic features on semi-automatic firearms.

He works for Wizards of the Coast, where he has designed several award-winning supplements and adventures for the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) roleplaying game. He is the author of several sci-fi and fantasy novels, including several Forgotten Realms books, and the 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide. Biography Wyatt grew up in Ithaca, NY where he attended Ithaca High School, graduating in 1986.The Bulletin: Ithaca High School 20th Reunion 1986/2006. July 1, 2006. Pg. 29. Archive copy at Scribd. He had been playing role-playing games since the late 1970s, beginning with the first Basic D&D; set: \\"I remember pretending to be a wizard in my backyard before I picked up the basic set... I used the monster statistics in the D&D; books to give us wizards something to fight in our primitive backyard live-action roleplaying game.\\" After high-school he attended Oberlin in Ohio as a religion major and graduated in 1990. He went on to receive a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary in New York City, in 1993. He was married soon after. In 1994 Wyatt began his working career as the minister of two small United Methodist churches in southeastern Ohio. While working as a minister Wyatt began writing in his spare time for Dragon magazine, starting with material for TSR's Masque of the Red Death setting. By 1996, Wyatt decided to change his career path: \\"While I was in the ministry, I started submitting adventures to Dungeon magazine... I found that my D&D; work was a source of freedom and energy when ministry was more life-draining for me. When I started getting adventures and articles accepted, it was so exciting that it became clear that D&D; would never again be just a hobby for me.\\" The same year he moved to Wisconsin in hopes of getting a full-time job at TSR, which did not immediately work out, but he kept writing material as a freelance author. Wyatt produced work for roleplaying games such as West End's Hercules and Xena, although he felt that \\"D&D; has always been my one true love in the gaming world... despite junior high flings with other game systems.\\" He continued to have material published in Dragon and Dungeon. In 1998 he moved to Berkeley, California, and in 2000 to the Seattle/Tacoma area of Washington state. Wizards of the Coast ultimately hired him in January 2000 to work on the D&D; game full-time; his first assignment was Monstrous Compendium: Monsters of Faer√ªn, of which he wrote two-thirds. His other early works for Wizards of the Coast included The Speaker in Dreams (a core adventure on the original Adventure Path, following The Sunless Citadel and The Forge of Fury), Defenders of the Faith, the monsters chapter in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, and numerous articles in Dragon and Dungeon. Wyatt wrote Oriental Adventures (2001), a setting book that Wizards had in process for over a year, and which offered new rules for Oriental realms, some of them specific to the world of Rokugan. He wrote City of the Spider Queen and co-authored numerous roleplaying game products, including Magic of Incarnum, Sharn: City of Towers, Draconomicon, The Book of Dragons, and Book of Exalted Deeds. Eberron was introduced with the Eberron Campaign Setting (2004), produced by Keith Baker alongside Wyatt and Bill Slavicsek. Early in 2005, Slavicsek organized a team to work on some early designs for a fourth edition of D&D;, which was headed up by Rob Heinsoo and also contained Collins and Wyatt; Heinsoo, Collins, and Wyatt formed the core fourth-edition team. Wyatt was on the SCRAMJET team, led by Richard Baker, and including Matt Sernett, Ed Stark, Michele Carter, Stacy Longstreet, and Chris Perkins; this team updated the setting and cosmology of D&D; as the fourth edition was being developed. He wrote the D&D; novels In the Claws of the Tiger (2006), Storm Dragon (2007), Dragon Forge (2008), Dragon War (2009), and Oath of Vigilance (2011). As of April 2016, he has left Dungeons & Dragons and now works on the writing and creative aspects of Magic: The Gathering. Honors Wyatt received Origins Awards in 2003 for City of the Spider Queen and in 2005 for the Eberron Campaign Setting, which he co- authored with Bill Slavicsek and Keith Baker. His other notable works include Oriental Adventures (for which he won an ENnie Award in 2002), Draconomicon, the Draconic Prophecies series, and Magic of Incarnum.

It breeds from Panama through Colombia, Venezuela and the Guianas to Bolivia and Brazil. It also occurs on Trinidad. This species is found in forests and the edges of mangrove swamps. The nest is a shallow cup of roots, bark and grass built in a tree. The typical clutch is two cream-coloured eggs marked with rufous and lavender. The adult forest elaenia is 12.7 cm long and weighs 12.2g. The head has a blackish crown with a partly concealed white or pale yellow central stripe, a weak whitish supercilium and white eyering. The upperparts are olive-green, and the brown wings have yellow feather edging and two yellow wing bars. The throat is whitish and the breast is greenish-yellow shading to yellow on the belly. The long narrow bill is black above and pink-based below. Sexes are similar. M. g. trinitatis, the subspecies endemic to Trinidad, is larger and has duller upper parts than mainland forms. Forest elaenias are seen alone or in pairs, perched inconspicuously or catching insects and spiders in higher levels of the foliage. They also frequently eat berries. They have a sharp pitch-weep call.

Overview Italian journalist and writer (1925‚Äì1996) wrote, \\"Je mehr B√ºrger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen\\" (\\"The more citizens with civil courage a country has, the fewer heroes it needs\\").  Contemporary use  Civil courage has been referred to by psychologist Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of bravery, carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one's own position. This is because this civil courage is often punished since it entails risks and almost ensures ostracism not only from a group that the courageous individual belongs but also from society. In this way, it is distinguished from altruistic behavior and other forms of courage. In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. This is demonstrated in the case of whistleblowers, who do not necessarily risk their lives but their action could lead to years in prison. There are those who associate civil courage to the concept of non-violence attributed to Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. and cited such association as the cause why it faded as a model of conduct due to the perception that it is uninteresting and boring.

Transdermal preparations of estrogen are metabolized differently than oral preparations. Transdermal estrogens avoid first-pass metabolism which allow transdermal preparations to contain a range of lower doses of estrogen, and thus potentially reduce the risk of blood clotting and stroke. An estrogen patch is applied directly to the skin, preferably near the lower abdomen, hips, or buttocks, and is changed once or twice per week. For women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, it is often suggested that they take progestin in addition to an estrogen patch in order to protect the endometrium of the uterus. Although it is uncommon, it is possible that women who have undergone a hysterectomy be recommended to take progestin as well. Transdermal estrogens are not recommended for all women; there are important precautions and side effects that should be considered before use.  Medical uses  = Menopause = An estrogen patch may be recommended for women experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of menopause, such as vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy. During menopause, the ovaries stop producing estrogen which causes estrogen levels to fall. The sudden change in estrogen levels may cause vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes. Research suggests that the estrogen patch can relieve both the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms by increasing estrogen levels. An estrogen patch may also be used to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy, another symptom of menopause associated with the sudden change in estrogen levels. = Hypoestrogenism = Hypoestrogenism, or estrogen deficiency, may suggest menopause is approaching for middle aged women. Other causes of hypoestrogenism are excessive exercise, restrictive diet, underactive pituitary gland, ovarian failure, Turner Syndrome, and kidney disease. Symptoms of hypoestrogenism may include pain during sex, irregular periods, mood swings, hot flashes, breast tenderness, headache, depression, fatigue, weak bones, and an increase risk of urinary tract infections. Estrogen therapies, including the use of an estrogen patch, can be used to alleviate these symptoms by increasing estrogen levels to a normal state. Premenopausal women may be recommended to take progestin with estrogen therapy. = Prevention of osteoporosis = Estrogen patches may be effective in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Research suggests that estrogen patches can significantly increases bone mineral density and reduce risks of fractures in postmenopausal women by raising estrogen levels and avoiding first-pass metabolism. There is evidence that the combination of an estrogen patch with a progestin pill can improve bone mineral density in young, premenopausal amenorrheic athletes, and may be more effective than an oral estrogen with progestin.  Patches with progestin  Taking progestin in addition to an estrogen patch should be considered for women who have not undergone a hysterectomy to regulate the thickness of the endometrial lining and reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Hysterectomized women rarely need progestin, however it may be considered if a history of endometriosis exists. There are different types of delivery systems of progestin that can be used in addition to an estrogen patch, including pills, injections, and patches. Research has suggested that estrogen plus progestin therapy may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, breast cancer, blot clots, and dementia in postmenopausal women. Taking the lowest effective dose of both estrogen and progestin may reduce risks. Administration Sandoz Estradiol Transdermal System with oral progestin Depending on the brand, patches are applied to the skin once or twice weekly. Patches should be placed on clean skin where hair and moisture is not present. Preferred areas of application include lower abdomen, hip, and buttocks. Patches should never be applied to the breasts. To reduce the risk of the patch detaching from the skin and skin irritation, skin care products, sun exposure, damaged skin, and tight-fitting clothing should be avoided where the patch is placed.  Side effects  Headache, breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding, spotting, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, hair loss, fluid retention, vaginal infections, skin irritation are some common side effects that may occur while using an estrogen patch. More severe, but less common side effects may include heart attack, stroke, blood clotting, dementia, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, increased blood pressure, increased blood sugar, gallbladder disease, liver issues, abnormal thyroid hormone levels, and tumors in the uterus. Seeing a health professional regularly, taking progestin, having pelvic and breast exams, lowering blood pressure, and lowering cholesterol may reduce the likelihood of developing severe side effects while using an estrogen patch.  Precautions  Women that have experienced vaginal bleeding post menopause, certain cancers, stroke, heart attack, blood clotting, or uncontrollable bleeding, and women who are pregnant or allergic to ingredients in estrogen patches should not use an estrogen patch as serious adverse effects may occur. Brand names Estrogen patches are available in multiple brand names in different countries. Some patches are available with a progestin such as levonorgestrel or norethisterone acetate.

History The town was founded under the name of El Zapallar on 25 April 1907, although the measurement and division of the terrain was not properly finished until 2 July 1913. Its progress was slow due to the lack of communications, which began only in 1917 when Juan Godoy opened a precarious bus line that linked El Zapallar with the provincial capital Resistencia, 120 km away. By 1924 El Zapallar had 5,000 inhabitants and was the head town of the Toba Department. It had a police station, a court, a civil registration, a social club, and mail and telegraph services. That year the El Zapallar Agricultural Cattleman Association was established. The Quijano railroad line also contributed to the growth of the town, by connecting it to Lapachito. A Development Commission was created by decree of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen in 1928. In 1934 the town was turned into a municipality, which was renamed General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n in 1955. Communications The area is crossed southwest to northwest by National Route 90, asphalted, which links it to Resistencia, and also by the Provincial Routes 3 and 7, which cross it respectively from east to west and from east to southwest.

He was a right-handed batsman and bowled part-time right-arm medium pace and twice captained Yorkshire, in the 2003 and 2009 seasons. He is the younger brother of the rugby league and union coach, Damian McGrath. Anthony is currently Head Coach at Essex CCC. In 2019 Essex, with Anthony at the helm became double champions, the first time this has ever been achieved by any club. Essex CCC won the T20 Blast competition and the County Championship within a week. England McGrath made his Test match debut for England against Zimbabwe at Lord's on 22 May 2003. He made 69 in his debut innings and took 3/16. In the second Test against Zimbabwe, McGrath scored his second half-century by making 81. His third Test was against South Africa and he made 34. In his fourth and final Test match he made a disappointing 4 and 13, and took 1/40 before being dropped from the team. Yorkshire McGrath made his debut in 1995 and was capped in 1999. He spent a year as captain in 2003 before stepping down to concentrate on his international career. He had a successful 2006 season hitting 1,293 first-class runs at an average of over 60. But he became disillusioned by the direction the club was taking after it only narrowly avoided relegation from County Championship Division One. It was only after Darren Gough's appointment as Yorkshire captain, and the major signings of Jacques Rudolph and Younis Khan that McGrath became convinced Yorkshire shared his ambitions and he decided to stay.McGrath agrees to stay with Tykes BBC Sport 2 March 2007 He then declared himself delighted with the new situation at Yorkshire and hoped to stay for as long as possible. After a slow start to the season, perhaps due to the off season situation, McGrath hit 135 not out in the opening Roses match of 2007, a one-dayer played at Old Trafford, and consecutive centuries against Durham (Friends Provident Trophy) and Kent (County Championship). His excellent form continued as he reached a personal milestone in the rain-affected Championship match with Warwickshire at Edgbaston, scoring 188 not out on 16 July 2007. He was appointed as captain for the 2009 season, but stepped down from leading the side in late 2009, as he felt the pressures of the job were affecting his form. Oddly, that season he increased his career best tally to 211, again scored against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. McGrath had a more successful season in 2010 scoring 1,219 first-class runs and, in doing so, passed the thousand runs mark for the third time. He also scored important runs in both the 40 and 20-over competitions. However, knee injuries and sciatica occurred in the next two seasons, which restricted his effectiveness. McGrath retired from professional cricket following the conclusion of the 2012 season. After retirement he worked as a coaching consultant for Yorkshire, and in February 2016 was appointed assistant head coach at Essex, assisting his former Yorkshire colleague Chris Silverwood McGrath was appointed the position of head coach at Essex in November 2017.

Mary River cod are one of Australia's most endangered freshwater fishes and are notable for being the most northerly of the four Maccullochella cods found or once found in coastal river systems of eastern Australia. Description The Mary River cod is a large fish recorded up to almost 40 kg and 120 cm in the early years of European settlement, but now are mostly less than 5 kg and 70 cm. Very similar in appearance to Murray cod and eastern freshwater cod, they are a striking looking, golden-yellow to dark green or brown, deep-bodied fish with dark green to black mottling. Curiously, Mary River cod have a slightly shorter, thicker caudal peduncle (tail wrist) than the other cod species. Conservation The Mary River Cod is listed as Endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and is estimated to only occur in less than 30% of its historic range. Mary River Cod are subject to the usual story of woe. Incredibly abundant at the time of first European settlement, they were grossly overfished with nets, lines and explosives by the early European settlers and, as with other Maccullochella cods, were even used as pig feed. This overfishing, combined with the massive siltation of their habitats by land clearing, destruction of riparian vegetation and cattle trampling river banks, and dams and weirs blocking migration, rapidly caught up with this large, slow-growing, long-lived Maccullochella cod species, as it has with all its close relatives. Outside of a few stocked Queensland impoundments- upstream of the walls of Cressbrook, Hinze, Maroon, Moogerah, North Pine, Somerset and Wivenhoe Dams and lakes Dyer (Bill Gunn dam) and Clarendon- the fish is a no take species and any caught should be carefully released. A strict bag limit of one fish with a minimum size of 50 cm applies to the stocked impoundments. Classification Taxonomically, Mary River cod were originally described as a subspecies of the Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii based on studies of muscle proteins and enzymes. As of 2010, after studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, Mary River cod have been raised to full species status.Nock C.J., Elphinstone M.S., Rowland S.J. and Baverstock, P.R. (2010).

He led the Cougars for five seasons, from 2003 through 2007, and was fired on November 26. Early life and career Born in South Bend, Indiana, Doba grew up in New Carlisle and graduated from New Carlisle High School in 1958. He played halfback and defensive back for two years at Ball State College in Muncie before hip injuries derailed his college football career. After graduating from Ball State, he started his coaching career at Goshen High School in Indiana as an assistant. After two years there, he worked as the head coach at Angola High School for two years, then went back to Goshen High for three years as the head coach. During this time, he earned a master's degree from Western Michigan University in physical education. His high school coaching career ended with a six-year stay at Mishawaka High School in Indiana, where he led his 1974 team to the big school state championship game. Moving to the college ranks, Doba became an assistant to Lee Corso at Indiana University for six years, coaching linebackers for five years and quarterbacks/wide receivers for one. He moved to Purdue University to work as the outside linebackers coach for three years and the tight end/tackles coach for one year. He left Purdue to become defensive coordinator at The Citadel in South Carolina, his first job outside the state of Indiana. He left The Citadel after two years to join the staff of new head coach Mike Price at Washington State University in Pullman.  At Washington State  In 1989, Doba became the linebackers coach at Washington State under Price. In 1991, he became a defensive assistant. In 1994, he became defensive coordinator and also reclaimed his linebackers coaching job. After Price left Washington State for the University of Alabama at the end of the 2002 season, Doba was named head coach, and took office immediately following the Rose Bowl. In his first season as head coach in 2003, Doba led the Cougars to a 10‚Äì3 record, with a Holiday Bowl win over Texas and a #9 final ranking. He shared the Pac-10 Coach of the Year award in 2003 with Pete Carroll of USC. The Holiday Bowl win was a high point of Doba's tenure and was one of the top wins in WSU history. His teams won three of five Apple Cup rivalry games against Washington, in 2004, 2005, and 2007. Unfortunately, the Cougars slumped after their sterling 2003 season, and Doba was unable to put together another winning team. Their 42‚Äì35 victory in the 100th Apple Cup in 2007 was not enough to save Doba's job. It was announced that Doba would not return for the 2008 season after compiling a 5‚Äì7 record for the 2007 season, the Cougars' fourth straight non-winning season. (WSU was 6‚Äì6 in 2006, but not invited to a bowl game.) He departed with an overall record of 30‚Äì29 () and was 17‚Äì25 () in conference play. Personal Doba and his late wife, Judy, were married for over forty-three years and had three children, a son and two daughters. Judy Doba died on April 21, 2006, after a four-year battle with ovarian cancer. Doba was inducted into the Mishawaka Hall of Fame in 1986, and later inducted into the Indiana Hall of Fame in 2001. He left Pullman and returned to the Midwest to be closer to his children and grandchildren, and resides in southwestern Michigan at Birch Lake, near Vandalia.

It is a basic tool in descriptive geometry. The projection is called orthographic if the rays are perpendicular (orthogonal) to the image plane, and oblique or skew if they are not. Overview Parallel projection terminology and notations. The two blue parallel line segments to the right remain parallel when projected onto the image plane to the left. A parallel projection is a particular case of projection in mathematics and graphical projection in technical drawing. Parallel projections can be seen as the limit of a central or perspective projection, in which the rays pass through a fixed point called the center or viewpoint, as this point is moved towards infinity. Put differently, a parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with an infinite focal length (the distance between the lens and the focal point in photography) or \\"zoom\\". In parallel projections, lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space remain parallel in the two-dimensional projected image. A perspective projection of an object is often considered more realistic than a parallel projection, since it more closely resembles human vision and photography. However, parallel projections are popular in technical applications, since the parallelism of an object's lines and faces is preserved, and direct measurements can be taken from the image. Among parallel projections, orthographic projections are the most realistic, and are commonly used by engineers. On the other hand, certain types of oblique projections (for example cavalier projection, military projection) are very simple to implement, and are used to create quick and informal pictorials of objects. The term parallel projection is used in the literature to describe both the procedure itself (a mathematical mapping function) as well as the resulting image produced by the procedure.  Properties  Two parallel projections of a cube. In an orthographic projection (at left), the projection lines are perpendicular to the image plane (pink). In an oblique projection (at right), the projection lines are at a skew angle to the image plane. Every parallel projection has the following properties. * It is uniquely defined by its projection plane Œ† and the direction \\\\vec v of the (parallel) projection lines. The direction must not be parallel to the projection plane. * Any point of the space has a unique image in the projection plane Œ†, and the points of Œ† are fixed. * Any line not parallel to direction \\\\vec v is mapped onto a line; any line parallel to \\\\vec v is mapped onto a point. * Parallel lines are mapped on parallel lines, or on a pair of points (if they are parallel to \\\\vec v). * The ratio of the length of two line segments on a line stays unchanged. As a special case, midpoints are mapped on midpoints. * The length of a line segment parallel to the projection plane remains unchanged. The length of any line segment is shortened if the projection is an orthographic one. * Any circle that lies in a plane parallel to the projection plane is mapped onto a circle with the same radius. Any other circle is mapped onto an ellipse or a line segment (if direction \\\\vec v is parallel to the circle's plane). * Angles in general are not preserved. But right angles with one line parallel to the projection plane remain unchanged. * Any rectangle is mapped onto a parallelogram or a line segment (if \\\\vec v is parallel to the rectangle's plane). * Any figure in a plane that is parallel to the image plane is congruent to its image.  Orthographic projection  A parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with a hypothetical viewpoint; i.e. one where the camera lies an infinite distance away from the object and has an infinite focal length, or \\"zoom\\". Various projections and how they are produced Orthographic projection is derived from the principles of descriptive geometry, and is a type of parallel projection where the projection rays are perpendicular to the projection plane. It is the projection type of choice for working drawings. The term orthographic is sometimes reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes of the object are parallel with the projection plane (or the paper on which the orthographic or parallel projection is drawn). However, the term multiview projection is also used. In multiview projections, up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes. Sub- types of multiview orthographic projections include plans, elevations and sections. When the principal planes or axes of an object are not parallel with the projection plane, but are rather tilted to some degree to reveal multiple sides of the object, it is called an axonometric projection. Axonometric projection (not to be confused with the closely related principle of axonometry, as described in Pohlke's theorem) is further subdivided into three groups: isometric, dimetric and trimetric projection, depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal. A typical (but not obligatory) characteristic of axonometric pictorials is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical. Oblique projection Comparison of several types of graphical projection. The presence of one or more 90¬∞ angles is usually a good indication that the perspective is oblique. In an oblique projection, the parallel projection rays are not perpendicular to the viewing plane, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees. In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings. In an oblique pictorial drawing, the displayed angles among the axes as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique projections include military, cavalier and cabinet projection.  Analytic representation  If the image plane is given by equation \\\\Pi:~\\\\vec{n}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{x}-d=0 and the direction of projection by \\\\vec v, then the projection line through the point P:~\\\\vec p is parametrized by :: g:~\\\\vec x = \\\\vec p+t\\\\vec{v} with t\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. The image P' of P is the intersection of line g with plane \\\\Pi; it is given by the equation ::P':~\\\\vec{p}' = \\\\vec p + \\\\frac{d-\\\\vec p\\\\cdot\\\\vec{n}}{\\\\vec{n}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v}}\\\\;\\\\vec{v} \\\\ . In several cases, these formulas can be simplified. (S1) If one can choose the vectors \\\\vec n and \\\\vec v such that \\\\vec{n}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v}=1, the formula for the image simplifies to :::\\\\vec p' = \\\\vec p + (d-\\\\vec p\\\\cdot\\\\vec{n})\\\\;\\\\vec{v} \\\\ . (S2) In an orthographic projection, the vectors \\\\vec n and \\\\vec v are parallel. In this case, one can choose \\\\vec v = \\\\vec n ,\\\\; \\\\vec n=1 and one gets :::\\\\vec p' = \\\\vec p + (d-\\\\vec p\\\\cdot\\\\vec{n})\\\\;\\\\vec{n} \\\\ . (S3) If one can choose the vectors \\\\vec n and \\\\vec v such that \\\\vec{n}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v}=1, and if the image plane contains the origin, one has d=0 and the parallel projection is a linear mapping: :::\\\\vec p' = \\\\vec p - (\\\\vec p\\\\cdot\\\\vec{n})\\\\;\\\\vec{v}=\\\\vec p-(\\\\vec v\\\\otimes \\\\vec n)~\\\\vec p = (I_3-\\\\vec v\\\\otimes \\\\vec n)\\\\;\\\\vec p \\\\ . (Here I_3 is the identity matrix and \\\\otimes the outer product.) From this analytic representation of a parallel projection one can deduce most of the properties stated in the previous sections.

TNRL estimate that there are roughly 1,500 players playing rugby league in Tonga for 2007.TNRL.com =History= Rugby League first came to the islands in 1986, with first international competition in the Pacific Cup in 1986 and it was held at Rarotonga and won by the NZ Maori. After early promise the game took a turn for the worse during the Super League war, which not only affected the elite competitions in Europe and Australia but also the game in the Pacific Islands. This was followed by a fall in revenue from the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, and the banning of cigarette sponsorship in Tonga almost saw the game disappear. Although, it didn't and the game was brought back for the TNRL domestic competition in 2006. In 2007, schools started to play and in 2008, had more divisions. The National Team Since Tonga began competing in international Rugby League it has participated in the Pacific Cup (since 1986), World Sevens (1994‚Äì2003), World Cup (since 1995), Superleague World Nines (1996,1997), Superleague Oceania Tournament (1997), Papua New Guinea Fiftieth Anniversary Competition (1998) and Pacific Rim (2004) competitions.

History There has been a long history of Fijian rugby union players making their mark in rugby league, most notably in the 1960s when Joe Levula and Laitia Ravouvou joined Rochdale Hornets and became household names in the English competition. However, rugby league was only introduced in Fiji in 1992. The man who was responsible for its introduction and who went on to become General Manager in those early years was Mr Culden Kamea. In consultation with the then Australian Rugby League (ARL), Mr Kamea was instrumental in the formation of the first Fiji team that took part in a sevens tournament in Sydney, unknowingly knocking over the Canberra Raiders in one of Fiji team's first ever games. That team was made up of some of the unknown players who were part of the all conquering Fiji rugby union sevens team that had won the Hong Kong sevens tournament 3 years in a row (1990‚Äì92). Players included Alifereti Dere, Pauliasi Tabulutu, Acura Niuqila and Noa Nadruku. Other players who transitioned to rugby league included Niko Baleiverata, Etuate Waqa, Ratu Orisi Cavuilati, Iosefo Bele, Pio Nakubuwai, Luke Erenavula, Kaiava Salusalu, Kalaveti Naisoro, Nemani Matirewa, Filimoni Seru, Ili Toga and boxer Aisea Nama. Players who were also part of the early Bati teams included those already playing in Australia such as Livai Nalagilagi, Jo Rabele, Manoa Thompson and James Pickering. The game has grown in popularity and is played in most of the main rugby playing provinces of Fiji. Its first ever President was the then Major General Sitiveni Rabuka whose stewardship did wonders for the game in those early years. The Bati recorded some notable victories in its first few years including over France (1994), The British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) team (1994), South Africa (1995 World Cup) and a New Zealand development team. The national team is known as 'Bati' (pronounced mmBarty) which is the Fijian word for 'Warrior'. The Crest has the words 'Noqu Kalou Noqu Vanua' which is Fijian for 'My God My Land'. Popularity The competition consists of 12 teams divided between East and West conferences. Once the Grand Final is played, a Super 6 competition takes place among the best players from the FNRL. In September a State of Origin type competition is played with East against West.http://www.fijirugbyleague.com/ The administration of rugby league in Fiji has focused more on building the skills base of their players to the levels of the larger rugby league nations rather than those they're used to playing in the Pacific Cup or Pacific Rim Championship.

With the introduction of rugby league into a small number schools and the formation of youth rugby league in Scotland it has seen juniors being signed to Super League clubs. History In 1895, there was a schism within the game of rugby in neighbouring England which saw the sport of rugby divided. Rugby union remained amateur and rugby league permitted payments to players. However, no such split took place in Scotland where the clubs continued to play rugby union. 14 Scottish players would cross over and play rugby league in England before amateurism was abandoned. The history of rugby league in Scotland goes back to 1909 when the touring Australian team drew 17‚Äì17 with a Northern Rugby Football Union representative side at Celtic Park, Glasgow. A further match against the Australians followed at Tynecastle, Edinburgh in 1911, again an 11‚Äì11 tie. After this the Rugby Football League largely gave up on expansion north of the border. Nonetheless, a number of Scottish rugby union players, particularly from the Border region, moved south to play for English clubs. The numbers were not nearly so great as with Welsh players (see Rugby league in Wales), and a Scottish national team was never seriously considered, though Scots did feature for Other Nationalities and were eligible for Great Britain. Probably the most famous figure in Scottish rugby league during this period was Dave Valentine, who captained Great Britain to World Cup victory in 1954. In 1989, a Scotland students side was formed at the University of Aberdeen, and this proved to be the catalyst for the formation of a number of other clubs. The national team first played in 1995, and a domestic league followed in 1997. In 2000 and 2002 the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final was held at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, the home of the Scottish Rugby Union. In 2000 Bradford Bulls defeated Leeds Rhinos 24‚Äì18, and in 2002 Wigan Warriors beat St. Helens 21‚Äì12. Both ties were played in front of over 60,000 spectators, by far the biggest rugby league events ever held in Scotland. Governing body Scotland Rugby League is the governing body for rugby league in Scotland overseeing development and participation at all levels of the sport. Competitions =Senior= The Scottish National League comprises four teams: Aberdeen Warriors, Ayrshire Storm, Easterhouse Panthers and Edinburgh Eagles. Any of these clubs can apply to play in the Rugby Football League, the highest tiers of rugby league in Great Britain, however none have currently chosen to do so. =Junior= The Saltire Schools Cup is a nationwide Scottish schools competition for boys and girls from S1‚ÄìS4 school age groups. The National Youth League is competed for at under-17 and under-15 level. Popularity Rugby league is a contracting sport in Scotland largely caused by the reduction in funding from the RFL, attracting stagnating interest. In addition to the four clubs in the Scottish National League, there are a small number of other clubs. The majority of the clubs are based in and around Glasgow, and Glasgow City Council provide funding for junior teams. Media There are two weekly rugby league newspapers, Rugby Leaguer & League Express and League Weekly, and two monthly magazines, Rugby League World and Thirteen Magazine. These cover the sport worldwide and across the UK. These publications are usually only available by subscription in Scotland.

The governing body of the game in Wales is the Wales Rugby League. There is a long but sporadic history of rugby league in Wales. Over the decades many hundreds of players have \\"gone north\\" to play for the leading English clubs. Consequently, the national side, nicknamed the Dragons, have often been a very strong force in the international game. History Rugby football was an increasingly popular sport for Wales in the 1890s, and particularly in the south where its popularity surpassed that of association football. The Welsh coal miners shared the same working class ethos of the miners from the northern counties of England. The impending schism of 1895 tore apart the English rugby union and in the early 1900s, the shock waves were being felt in rugby worldwide, though there was little desire in Wales to embrace professionalism. Amateurism in Wales was seen as a means of holding together a community in which there were expectations by the public on their sportsman to not turn their back on international rugby. The Welsh took pride in the position rugby gave them in the sporting world, and therefore the Welsh Rugby Union saw little attraction in turning professional. Nonetheless, many Welsh players signed for English clubs. The Northern Union's administrators began to ponder the possibilities of international competitions against an English representative side. The first attempt met with a lack of public interest, and the first scheduled Northern Union international, also became the first postponed Northern Union international. It was rescheduled for the 5 April 1904. The team opposing England was labelled Other Nationalities and consisted of Welshmen and a few Scots. The Other Nationalities proved too strong, defeating the English 9 - 3. In 1905, England gained back some credibility with a 21 - 11 win. In 1907 a professional version of the \\"All Blacks\\" rugby team from New Zealand (nicknamed the All Golds by Australian press) toured England in what became the first set of international games played under the new NU rules. The All Golds had not played under the Northern Union rules and underwent a week of intensive training. The first Wales international league game took place at Aberdare on 1 January 1908 played against the All Golds. Wales went on to defeat New Zealand 9-8, the winning try scored by former Wales rugby union international Dai Jones. In 1907, the Welsh Northern Union was formed in Wrexham, but the Northern Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the South of Wales and the WNU soon folded. In 1907 two Welsh clubs Ebbw Vale RLFC and Merthyr Tydfil RLFC joined the Northern Union and also competed in the Challenge Cup. In the 1908-09 season, there were sufficient numbers of Welsh clubs to run a separate Welsh League section of the competition, alongside the Northern Union's Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues. The Welsh League lasted only two seasons before folding in 1910 after most of the competing teams disbanded. In 1926, the RFL formed a Welsh commission in an attempt to convert rugby union clubs to rugby league. From 1949 to 1955 a Welsh league was run by the Welsh commission but it was disbanded due to lack of interest and finance. Founder members were Neath, Cardiff, Llanelli, Bridgend, Ystradgynlais, Aberavon, Amman Vale and Blaina. Harsh economic times in the 1980s meant that rugby union players such as Jonathan Davies and Scott Gibbs \\"went north\\" to play professional rugby league in order to earn a living. This flow of players was halted when rugby union became professional in 1995. With the Rugby League Conference‚Äôs growth throughout England, the RFL and its WRL arm set up an amateur club, the Cardiff Demons who joined the Central South Division of the Rugby League Conference in 2001. The Demons, who were mainly made up of former players from the university UWIC rugby league club, were quite successful and instantly saw interest from other parts of Wales grow. In 2002, two former students of Swansea University decided to set up a local club called the Swansea Bulls, now Swansea Valley Miners, with a view to playing friendly matches against the Demons and other touring clubs. Peter Thomas and Gareth Jones, both former Welsh Student RL team members, started an amateur team out of the Morriston R.F.C. ground with a mixture of university and local union players. Junior teams soon started playing league and one team, coached by Neville Price, was coached by the Bradford Bulls team coaches on a weekend tour. The following year, the RFL decided to expand, letting in six more open-age sides to form the Welsh division of the Rugby League Conference with North Wales Coasters playing in one of the English divisions. With the traditional venue of Wembley being rebuilt, the Rugby League Challenge Cup was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Wales Rugby League achieved governing body status in 2005 and employed its first professional chairman, Mark Rowley, in 2006. Crusaders joined National League Two in 2006. They played against Brisbane Broncos in the Bulmers Original Cider Challenge at the Brewery Field on Thursday 15 February 2007, losing with a scoreline of 6-32. They achieved promotion to National League One in 2007. The Rugby Football League (RFL) took an entire round of Super League matches to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on the weekend of 5‚Äì6 May 2007. This was called Millennium Magic. Welsh professional clubs Celtic Crusaders (black) are the only Welsh club to have competed in the Super League, having done so between 2009 and 2011. There have been various attempts to introduce professional rugby league to Wales throughout the 20th century. Merthyr Tydfil and Ebbw Vale joined for the 1907/08 season; followed closely behind Aberdare, Barry, Mid-Rhondda and Treherbert joined in 1908/09. The 1908/09 season saw the first Welsh League, played alongside the Northern Union League. Aberdare, Barry, and Mid-Rhondda dropped out after that season, with Treherbert following the next year. Merthyr Tydfil lasted until 1910/11, and Ebbw Vale was the last of these to leave, after 1911/12. The next Welsh club was Pontypridd, who joined in 1926/27; only to dropped out after 8 games of the 1927/28 season. A Cardiff club participated in the 1951/52 season, but disbanded after that season. Following the example of Fulham F.C. (who founded the RL team that is now London Broncos), Cardiff City F.C. decided to enter a team for the 1981/82 season. The Blue Dragons, as they were known, shared Ninian Park with the Bluebirds until the 1983/84 season, when the club went into liquidation. They were then moved to Bridgend for the 1984/85 season, where they placed on the bottom of the table, and were expelled after the season for failing to obtain a home ground. Another attempt to establish a professional rugby league club was made in the 1990s. South Wales finished 6th in the Second Division in 1996, and, because of small crowds, withdrew from the league before the following season. There are now two professional rugby league clubs in Wales. The Crusaders Rugby League team, based in Wrexham, played in the Super League competition up until 2011. After going into administration they have become North Wales Crusaders. The second club is llanelli-based West Wales Raiders established in 2017 following the demise of the South Wales Ironmen side which were based in Merthyr Tydfil. Both teams currently play in the League 1 competition in 2018. Governing body The Rugby Football League were the governing body for rugby league in the UK. They were formed as the Northern Rugby Union in 1895. In 1907, the Welsh Northern Union was formed in Wrexham, but the Northern Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the South of Wales, which is the heartland of Welsh rugby union, and the WNU soon folded. In 1926, the newly renamed RFL formed a Welsh commission in an attempt to convert rugby union clubs to rugby league. The Wales Rugby League was formed in 1995 and recognised at that time as the governing body of rugby league in Wales by the Rugby Football League, the British Amateur Rugby League Association and the Welsh Sports Council. It employed its first professional chairman, Mark Rowley, in 2006. Wales became the 12th full member of the Rugby League International Federation following a meeting of the Federation board in Melbourne in May 2010. Competitions and League System =Senior= Club rugby league in Wales is played in a full British league system operated by the Rugby Football League. The South Wales Conference and North Wales Conference are the highest tier exclusive Welsh division of the league system and are currently 5th tier in the league pyramid. Wales currently has two professional clubs who compete in the RFL, North Wales Crusaders and West Wales Raiders. =Junior= Wales's junior competition is the Welsh Conference Junior League. In 2011 there was a North Wales Under 12 league. In the Conference Youth League there were two Welsh sides: North Wales Crusaders and CPC Bears. Popularity In the early 21st century rugby league gained in popularity in Wales. Matches between teams in the Welsh Premier division generally draw crowds of around 300 spectators. During the reconstruction of Wembley stadium the Challenge Cup final was played at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and one year a reported 15,000 tickets were sold in Wales out of an overall attendance of around 70,000. The record attendance for any rugby league game in Wales was set in 2005 with 74,213 attending the Challenge Cup final in Cardiff. =Media= BBC Sport own the rights to broadcast a highlights package called the Super League Show which was first broadcast in Wales in 2008.

It was first released on July 9, 2004. Like its predecessors, Windows CE 5.0 is marketed towards the embedded device market and independent device vendors. Windows CE 5.0 is billed as a low-cost, compact, fast-to-market, real-time operating system available for x86, ARM, MIPS, and SuperH microprocessor-based systems. Windows CE 5.0 builds on previous Windows CE releases in its adoption of shared source. Since 2001, Microsoft has been steadily expanding the available Windows CE source tree with embedded system developers. Windows CE 5.0 is the most open Microsoft operating system to date, though not all of the system is available under shared source agreements. Developers have the freedom to modify down to the kernel level, without the need to share their changes with Microsoft or competitors.

History Rugby league was established in Italy prior to the 1950s, during which they played a host of other European teams. Jean Galia's efforts in the mid-1930s to persuade his fellow countrymen in France to adopt rugby league soon attracted the attention of a trainee commercial lawyer and rugby union player in Turin, Vincenzo Bertolotto. But an exhibition game suggested for Rome did not materialise. But after the Second World War, discontent with the policies of the Italian rugby union in refusing to strengthen their game to put it on a level with France, led to thoughts of alternatives and the Italian Rugby League was launched in 1950 after several years of talks between then RFL secretary, Bill Fallowfield, and a group of Italian rugby union dissidents. The first game in Italy, an exhibition match in Turin by two French sides, was attended by over 4,000 fans. A local resident, Dennis Chappell, once of Wakefield helped to foster the \\"rebels\\", among them one Vincenzo Bertolotto, then an elder statesman of Italian rugby at 38 years old. Together, they organised a six-game tour to England and Wales which included a game against a \\"South Wales 13\\" at the Brewery Field in Bridgend, future home of Celtic Crusaders. Around 2,500 attended to see South Wales win comfortably 29-11 with Ystradgynlais' Les Lewis notching a hat-trick of tries. The Italians went on to lose all of their matches but on returning home, a Turin-based side joined the French league. The 1950s were a high point in international rugby league, after which a few European teams would lose interest. Despite playing host to the World Champions twice in 1960 when Australia defeated Italy 37-15 in Padua and defeated Italy again 67-22 at Treviso, by 1962 the game had died out due to pressure on players from the Italian Rugby Union threatening to ban anyone caught playing rugby league. It would be left to two pioneering Australians to get the game back up and running when international rugby league began to expand again in the late 1990s. In January 1960 at the end of their 1959‚Äì60 Kangaroo Tour, the Australian national rugby league team played two internationals against an Italian representative team. The first game, played on 23 January at the Stadio Euganeo in Padua in front of 3,500 curious fans, saw the Kangaroos defeat Italy 37‚Äì15.1960 Italy vs Australia game 1 The second game played the next day at the Stadio Omobono Tenni in Treviso, saw Australia win 67‚Äì22 in front of 3,105 fans.1960 Italy vs Australia game 2 Italian rugby league national team was revived in 1995 in Australia through the passion of a couple of enthusiasts by the names of Domenic (Mick) Pezzano and John Benigni. Both, were determined to have a rugby league team representing their origins compete again on the world stage, with a team formed with athletes from Australia and some from Italy. This dream was soon realised when the Italian team was invited to play in the 1995 World Sevens, which was Italy's first game since the 1960s. Pezzano coached the Italian team in the 1995 Coca-Cola World Sevens in Sydney and 1996 Super League Nines in Fiji. Other Coaches of the Italian National Team have been; David Riolo, David Penna, Craig Salvatori, Carlo Napolitano, Cameron Ciraldo and Leo Epifania. Italy went on to record their first win, in their first year and play many other international tournaments such as the Super League World Nines and the 1997 World Sevens to name a few. There were also a number of one-off international appearances against a Lebanese Sevens team, a Lebanese 13 a side team in a promotional match for the Mediterranean Cup and in 2004 when Italy played Greece in Sydney.

The first game played at Marsa in 2005 by a largely Australian-Maltese touring team from the East-coast of Australia. The Maltese team opened with a successful 366 victory over England Lionhearts and featured one local Maltese player, Robert Bonavia. History The Maltese Rugby League Association (MRLA) was formed in April 2004 at the Russian Club in Strathfield, Australia. Malta made their international debut on 25 September 2004 when they defeated British Defence Forces at Melita Stadium, Sydney, Australia. *Score: Malta won 78-0 *Crowd: 120 Malta's first rugby league international played on home soil was on Saturday October 2005 against England Lionhearts at Marsa Sports Complex, Marsa. *Score: Malta won 36-6 *Crowd: 500 The first domestic rugby league match in Malta was on Saturday 13 October 2007 between San Giljan Dragons and Birkirkara Warriors at Floriana Stadium.

The MRL is an Affiliate Member of the Rugby League European Federation (RLEF) and recognised by the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF). The MRL is also a member of the Kunsill Malti ghall-iSport (KMS) - the national organisation responsible for supporting, developing and promoting sport throughout Malta and Gozo. The organisation was formed in 2008 following the merger of the now defunct Maltese Rugby League Association (formed 2004 in Australia) and the local Kumitat Nazzjonali ta Rugby League f‚ÄôMalta (2006), in a move that was designed to homogenise Maltese rugby league‚Äôs structure and further its European dimension. Full European integration occurred in 2011 when the remaining Australian-based Directors resigned, paving the way for locals to take their place. A nine-person Board oversees MRL policy, with an operations manager from each club responsible for the day-to-day running of the sport. Competitions In October 2007 the first domestic rugby league competition, the Malta Rugby League Nines, was contested with fixtures at Floriana Stadium, Floriana. Participating teams were the San Giljan Dragons, Mosta Titans, Sliema Broncos, Qormi Sharks, Birkirkara Warriors and the Siggiewi Storm along with the British Royal Logistics Corps. A Malta selection were crowned champions after defeating the Royal Logistics Corps in the final. Between 2009 and 2010, the MRL Championship took place with only four games played between \\"North\\" and \\"South\\". There is also a Wheelchair rugby league championship and an MRL Academy. Popularity The match against England Lionhearts was partly the catalyst for continued rugby league development on the Maltese Islands and has helped set up a domestic competition within Malta. A crowd of approximately 750 were in attendance for the first rugby league match in Malta played at Matthew Micallef St John Athletic Stadium, Marsa. The MRL's Australian links lie in the form of Maltese Heritage Rugby League that enables the foundation to promote the legacy across Australia, promoting and developing rugby league within the Maltese community. Maltese Heritage RL has teams catering for 12-year-olds through to seniors, via Academy, U16s, U18s and the Open Age Maltese Heritage RL team. The national team The Malta national rugby league team is made up of local rugby league players from Malta and Heritage players from England and Australia. The team is nicknamed the Knights.

The Russian Association of Rugby League Clubs (ARLK) is the governing body of rugby league in Russia. History Soviet delegation attended Dewsbury's 1973 English Championship win and suggested that exhibition games be held in Eastern Europe to gauge interest. Rugby league returned in the late 1980s thanks largely to the efforts of Edgar Taturyan (there are different spellings of his name due to problems converting Cyrillic script to the Latin alphabet). Edgar Taturyan helped develop the new game with players from Moscow's rugby schools and supervised the game's expansion outside of the capital. Early success for Russian rugby league came in the form of one of the Locomotive Rugby Football Club's junior team of 1987 which was sent to England to compete in a series of matches. Despite being expected to lose every game to their far more experienced opponents, the youngsters won all five of their matches. This proved that Russia could take to rugby league as well as any other country. Taturyan's work allowed rugby league to become established; more importantly it was established before the onset of the chaos that accompanied the dissolution of the USSR, which would have made it nearly impossible to establish a new sport in Russia after 1991. Luckily by that time the Russian Rugby Football League (RRFL) had already been established. Mr Maslov, at the time a member of the Russian Rugby Union (RRU), watched a game of rugby league on BBC TV and was instantly converted. With that, Maslov and his friend and President of the Russian Rugby Union, Edgar Taturyan, formed the RRFL. Russian Rugby Football League After the initial formation of the RRFL many of Maslov and Taturyan's RRU associates changed allegiances and joined the administration of Russia's new fledgling sport. Prior to the commencement of the RRFLs inaugural rugby league championship in 1990, 3 teams, Moscow Magicians, Leningrad and Tiraspol were sent to England to learn the finer points of rugby league. On the teams' return all three took part in the first RRFL championship, between the 3 teams which had toured England as well as those based in Kazan, Alma-Ata and Krasnoyarsk. Two of the 3 initial teams went on to play in the inaugural final, which was staged in Tiraspol, Moldova. The occasion attracted in excess of 5,000 spectators. The next season saw a dramatic increase in the number of teams competing in rugby league with the national competition expanding to 7 teams from all over the country. The teams which competed in 1991 were Moscow Magicians, Tiraspol, Moscow Spartak, Red Arrows, Lions of St Petersburg, Kazan, Stars of Asia and Moscow Bears. It was Tiraspol's year as they beat the Magicians 26‚Äì16 in the final played in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. In May 1991, York and Fulham RLFC toured Russia. Following Tiraspol's RRFL final win in 1991, the Moscow Magicians took a stranglehold on the domestic competition for the next 4 years winning as many titles. It was then the turn of Strela Locomotive for 2 years, followed by the Kazan Arrows who have become the most successful team in Russian history. From the early formation of the league to 1993 the competition was going strong with junior participation on the rise and teams of Kazakhstan and Georgia trying to gain admittance to the league. =Challenge Cup history= Kazan Arrows and Moscow Locomotive made history in December 2001 by becoming the first Russian teams to feature in the Rugby Football League Challenge Cup, one of the most prestigious international rugby league tournaments in the world. Since 2001 Russian clubs have travelled to England to take part in the tournament. Moscow club Dinamo entered the cup in the 2nd round of the 2004 competition and became the first Russian team to achieve victory in any match of the challenge cup since the Russians' first appearance in 2001. The same year Locomotive joined Dinamo when entering the competition in the 3rd round. =Cross roads of 2005= One of the best years for the game in Russia had to be 2004, thanks mostly to Akhmet Kamaldinov, then president of the RRFL. Kamaldinov also took on role of financier to not just the federation, but the game of rugby league in Russia, providing money, referees' kit and development work for the league and equipment for all of the RRFL clubs as well as funding and organising major international events such as the Victory Cup. The game in Russia which had achieved steady gains since his arrival with junior numbers up and the national league looking strong. Only weeks after an internal row between the Dinamo and Locomotive clubs in Moscow led to the exit of national coach Bob Bailey, there now seemed to be pressure from Locomotive on Kamaldinov's presidency of the RRFL. Locomotive were of the opinion that they and not Kamaldinov should run the RRFL. The 29 January 2005 was pencilled in as the day that would decide Kamaldinov's future with the RRFL. On word of the unrest in Russia, the RLEF representative flew out to the 29 January meeting in an effort to restore harmony in the RRFL. The meeting ended badly and unfortunately led to Kamaldinov's and Vladmimir Dolgin's resignations from the RRFL as president and chairman respectively. Following Kamaldinov's departure it was feared he would leave rugby league altogether; in what could have been the crushing blow to the game in Russia, Kamaldinov withdrew all support for the game as financier to the federation, its clubs and even went as far as to move club Dinamo to a rugby union sevens league. Despite all that happened early in the year, the RRFL went ahead with its annual championship, including the youth world cup, which was thought by many not to go ahead. The jury is still out as to whether or not rugby league in Russia can survive its latest crisis. Competitions until 2008 =Russian Championship= The Russian Championship (or Russian Super League or Championship of Russia) consisted of 6 teams in the 2008 season: *Locomotive ‚Äì Moscow *Arrows ‚Äì Kazan *Vereya ‚Äì Moscow Region *Crystal ‚Äì Rostov-on-Don *Kosmos ‚Äì Moscow Region *Legion ‚Äì Kharkiv (Ukraine) Dinamo Moscow and St Petersburg Nevskaya Zastava started the season but failed to complete it.

However Russian teams have not played in the challenge Cup since 2009 due to the funding crisis in Russian Rugby League.  The Crisis of 2009 and 2010 =Olympic Status of Rugby Union Sevens and the expulsion of Rugby League from the State Register of Sports of Russia= By mid-2009 the three major clubs of Russian Rugby League had moved over to Rugby Union as a result of government pressure to achieve results in rugby union sevens, newly designated as an Olympic Sport. These clubs were Kazan Arrows, Dinamo Moscow and the champions for the past eight years, Lokomotiv Moscow.Rugby League World June 2010 pages 62‚Äì66 Russian Ministry of Sports order number 21 dated 20 January 2010 expelled the Rugby League from the State Register of Sports of Russia.

Mr Eremin, the board members and employees of the RRLF are currently investigating the potential for the continuation of Rugby League in Russia with various government, civic and sports organizations, in particular the ministry of Sports and Rugby Union of Russia. After the turmoil of the RRLF losing clubs and players, Edward Taturian has now caused a split with the Rugby League Federation, to potentially form an Association of Rugby League Clubs. =The Association of Rugby League Clubs of Russia (ARLKR)= 2010 began with no clear framework or competition, within this context the old figurehead Taturyan established the Association of Rugby League Clubs of Russia (ARLKR) seemingly independent of the RRLF. The following clubs joined the ARLKR association: #Nevsky Gate #Vereyskaya Bears #Threshers #North Moscow #Nara #Otradnoe #Spartak-Losinka. (In 1991, Edgard Taturian, the former coach of the Soviet Rugby team, split from the Russian rugby union and took over some teams to found the Russian Rugby League. The game grew and became known as the Russian Rugby League Federation.) Current domestic competition Rugby league is now played domestically in conferences. North, Central and South. At the conclusion of each conference's fixtures, the top teams enter into the national championship. Popularity Rugby league has over 2,000 active participants in Russia. The game has grown steadily since its formation in the 1980s despite no Government assistance and a reliance on a passionate group of volunteers.

The first rugby league match in Serbia was held in Belgrade on November 26, 1953, between French students and Selection Provence. The game was part of an attempt by the French Rugby XIII Federation to stimulate interest in the sport in Serbia. The first rugby league club formed in Serbia was Partizan, on November 1, 1953, followed a couple of months later by Radniƒçki. The two teams played their first match on April 26, 1954, with Partizan winning 21-11. In 1961, the Yugoslav national team played their first and only match against a French amateur XIII, with the team going down 13-0. Whilst rugby league was played in Serbia, Croatia played the rival code of rugby union and Yugoslav authorities demanded that Serbian clubs switch to rugby union to unite Yugoslavia under one form of rugby football in 1964.Cotton, p17 Rugby league officially returned to Serbia in 2001, with the formation of the Serbian Rugby League Federation at meeting held in Kru≈°evac.

The National Team The National Team, which has represented Serbia, has competed in the Rugby League Mediterranean Cup in both 2003 and 2004 and had shown great improvement on the second occasion. In 2005 they also participated in a three-way qualification tournament for the Rugby League European Nations Cup with the Holland and Georgia. In 2006 Serbia participated in a four-way Rugby League World Cup qualifications/ENC B tournament with Russia, Georgia and Holland. During July 2006, the Serbian U-19 national team participated in the U-19 European Nations Cup in Northern Catalonia.

They won Czech Republic in Prague and their captain Radoslav Novakoviƒá lifted the Slavic Cup. The Serbian team played without Serbian origin players from UK or Australia. On October 28, 2006, Serbia played Greece in Athens an historic match as it was the first Rugby League match on Greek soil. Greece was at an advantage in this match, as 10 out of their 17 players were Australian-based Greeks. Although Serbia lost the match 44-26, they played well against a team that included much more experienced players. The Serbian players said it was an honour to play against Salford City Reds player Michael Korkidas. However, this did not stop the Serbian players from being as physical as possible against Korkidas. This match was watched by 250 spectators in Athens. The low crowd was due to Greek Rugby Union trying to stop the game from being played, it was not advertised. Belgrade hosted the first U16 European Nations Cup from 27 June to 3 July. Serbian boys made great upset by beating Russia 22-10 in the first match of their pool. In the second round, England (later winners of the Cup) won Serbia 46-0 and in 3rd place playoff Serbia lost to European Celts 22-20.

He was also one of three nominees for the award of Best Emerging Nations Player at the Rugby League International Federation awards in Sydney on November 20, 2006. This award was won by St George Illawarra Dragons' Wes Naiqama, who represented Fiji. UK-born player of Serbian origin (and also Serbian RL international) Luka Simeunoviƒá lifted the English U-21 Senior Academy Cup as captain of the Halifax R.L.F.C. Academy team. He is one of the most successful Rugby League players with Serbian roots, alongside his older brother James, and he is a member of Halifax 27-men squad. In March 2007, Serbian Rugby League national team have beaten the British Prison Service 44-24 and won Belgrade Trophy. In 2007, some Serbian players have their sights set on breaking into the French Elite League, while others may be headed for Russia or England.

History The history of rugby league in Georgia began in 1991 when a Georgian player was recruited by a Russian rugby league club. In 1993 a rural Georgian rugby union club team defected to the Russian Rugby League. The club and all of its players were banned from playing rugby union in the future. Despite these previous endeavours rugby league was effectively unknown in Georgia until late 2004 when a French-based rugby enthusiast Paata Tsintsadze established the Georgian National Rugby League Federation (GNRLF). In June 2004 the GNRLF was incorporated, and recognised by the State Sports Ministry. Nodar Andghuladze was the first Chief Executive Officer and David Kilassonia the coaching manager. Tsintsadze presented to the European Federation his proposal and plans for the GNRLF after which it was agreed that the GNRLF be recognised as the governing body for the sport in Georgia. Furthermore, Georgia became active participants in the European Federation's meetings and activities from then on. Early in 2005, the GNRLF team set the ambitious goal of sending the national team, which had not yet been played a game, to the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. On 5 September 2005 the GNRLF were told that official observer status of the GNRLF would be withdrawn with immediate effect and given to the new Georgian Rugby 13 (GR13) organisation. Despite of RLEF's decision to recognize the newly founded GR13F instead of the former GNRLF as official observers of the code in Georgia, the latter showed reluctance in handing over the under 16 matters to the GR13. This ultimately meant that Georgia were unable to attend the youth world championship. Governing body The governing body for rugby league in Georgia was the Georgian Rugby League Federation. It was founded in 2004 by former France rugby union player, Paata Tsintsadze. National team The Georgia national rugby league team represented Georgia in international rugby league tournaments. The national squad was entirely from Georgian-based rugby union players. Despite there having been no domestic rugby league the team attracted relatively large crowds for international matches, in the range of 10,000 spectators. However, they were expelled from the 2008 Rugby League World Cup qualifiers for forfeiting a game in Russia, due to their players playing rugby union at the time and subsequently stopped playing the game and were expelled from the Rugby League International Federation and Rugby League European Federation.

In 2013 rugby league was introduced to Kenya once more by Glenn and Caroline Jamieson with a real emphasize in youth rugby league. History The catalyst for the attempt to introduce rugby league into Kenya came from Eddie Rombo, a former Kenyan rugby union player, who went on to play rugby league with British side Leeds Rhinos. After retiring from the sport, Rombo announced his intention to return to his native land and establish rugby league. In 2000, he did so, with the backing of a Kenyan businessman named Eric Murungi. Teams were formed, coaching sessions undertaken and a website set up. However the efforts came to nought, and no rugby league game was ever played. In 2013, after seeing many of Kenya's youth missing the opportunity to participate in sport, Kenyan Caroline Jamieson along with husband Glenn Jamieson set up programs aimed at developing youth rugby league in Kenya, concentrating on the least fortunate.

There has been three dynasties of rugby league in South Africa that attempted to establish a thriving rugby league. Not all attempts were in the interest of South Africans; rather an interest in financial windfall. Others took to the townships and promoted the league at the grass roots, which saw some of the most successful periods of rugby league in South Africa. The game has changed over 50 years of involvement in South Africa and today is played by a small number of teams in 3 competitions, the Rhino Cup, Protea Cup and Western Province Rugby League which is administered by the South African Rugby League. The National Team The South African national rugby league team is called the Rhinos. In addition to the national team, a representative team of South Africans living in the United Kingdom was formed in 2004 called the Wild Dogs (now defunct). History Rugby league in South Africa has a long and turbulent history, consisting of no less than three administrations over 40 years that attempted to establish the game of rugby league in South Africa. None, certainly the earlier attempts, were very successful. The first attempted expansion of the code into South Africa was primarily put together by the English and encouraged by the French for the purpose of expanding the game into new nations, that would inevitably bring more tests to the English and French shores, ensuring a lucrative future. At least, that was the plan; however it was not to be, the South African public did not take to the sport and the expansion plans were stopped prematurely causing a third scheduled match in London to not be played. The second attempted expansion was a strange double act in the 1960s consisting of two separate factions, known as the National Rugby League and South African Rugby League. Each fought for their own survival until the RLIF laid down the law that saw the NRL effectively shut down and its clubs moved to the SARL. All was looking good for SARL until a South African representative team toured Australia and were embarrassingly beaten. In 1991 the South African Rugby Football League was established to promote amateur rugby league. 1998's World Club Challenge between the British and Australian champions was mooted as a showpiece fixture at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. However this didn't eventuate. From 2009 there were two South Africans playing in Australia, Jarrod Saffy who plays for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, Allan Heldsinger who plays for the Redcliffe Dolphins. In 2010 the Sydney Roosters have signed South African rugby union junior JP Du Plessis. The NRL plan to sign more South Africans in the future.http://www.leaguehq.com.au/news/lhqnews/storm-looks-to-south-african- talent/2009/07/29/1248546769075.html So far the Sydney Roosters have signed four South African rugby union players and Peter O'Sullivan stated he will bring them all on a bus back to Bondi the Melbourne Storm have also recruited players from the country.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/south- africa-raids-wont-stop/story-e6frexnr-1225769311736 In 2011 a host of changes were implemented by the remaining clubs, the first of which was to elect a representative board and establish a Commercial Entity to take the sport forward. The result is a new National Club Championship as well as several international tours next year. The South African Senior Side also played in the Rugby League World Cup Qualifier in 2011 and will hope to build in 2012 towards a strong showing in the 2012 and 2013 international seasons. The South African Students will be competing in the Rugby League Students World Cup in July 2013 in England.http://www.rlfowc2013.com/student National Club Competition There are currently three competitions in South Africa, the Rhino Cup, the first division, consisting of 4 teams, the Protea Cup, the second division, consisting of 8 and the Western Province Rugby League, the third division, consisting of 8 teams. The competition started in 2009 with only four teams from all provinces, with the Ermelo Tomahawks winning. In 2010 and 2011, the Rhino Cup was held with the Middelburg Tigers and the TUKS Reds coming out the victors. In 2012, there was no Cups held, instead, there were derby matches on different provinces; Western Cape, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng. In 2013, the Rhino Cup was reinstated and the Protea Cup and the Western Cape Cup was added as well. The TUKS Rugby League took the Rhino and Protea Cups in the 2013-14 season.

The platform was developed starting in 1953 under an Office of Naval Research (ONR) contract to Hiller Aircraft, and flew successfully beginning in 1955.  Design and development  The original concept had been developed by Charles H. Zimmerman in the late 1940s. Further development followed, both by Hiller Aircraft and the De Lackner Company. There were two main models, the ONR model 1031-A-1, and the somewhat larger VZ-1 Pawnee model produced in 1956 for the U.S. Army. Three of each model were built as prototypes. Neither of the variants was put into production. The smaller ONR model used two Nelson H-59 piston engines, coupled to the propellers by a modified helicopter transmission built by the Industrial Power Division of Hall-Scott. The larger Pawnee model used three of those engines and had an extended duct area. The Pawnee had ineffective \\"kinesthetic control\\" and instead had the operator seated on a platform controlling the flight with conventional helicopter controls.  Testing and evaluation  Due to aerodynamic effects in the duct within which the propellers rotated, the platform was dynamically stable, even though the pilot and center of gravity of the platform were fairly high up. In testing, the prototypes flew well, but the U.S. Army judged them to be impractical as combat vehicles as they were small, limited in speed and only barely flew out of the ground cushion effect. Two of the six prototypes are known to survive; both are ONR 1031-A-1 models. One is located at the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California, the other is at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\\"Hiller Model 1031-A-1 Flying Platform.\\" Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

The code was first introduced to Canada in the 20th century, but the game struggled to survive in a competitive sporting market. By the end of the century, rugby league had disappeared completely from Canada. The game was re- introduced to Canada in the early 21st century with the formation of a national team. The start of an amateur domestic competition saw rugby league grow. In 2017, professional rugby league arrived in Canada with the Toronto Wolfpack joining the predominantly British and French Rugby Football League system in the third tier League 1. History Games related to rugby football have been played in Canada since the 19th century, with the first Rugby Union being established in 1861. However, the rugby league made little headway into the country, where rugby union and later Canadian football were the dominant field sports. In 1928 the Great Britain Lions, Britain's national rugby league team, visited Canada on their way home from a tour of Australia and New Zealand. According to the Imperial Rugby League Board, a domestic competition using rugby league rules was held in Canada the following year.http://www.canadarugbyleague.com/history/index.php?pageid=1000019 From the late 19th century Canadian unions adopted rule changes, generally similar to changes made in the United States, which created the sport known as Canadian football. Through the 20th century football gained in popularity, displacing other codes. With support declining, the Nova Scotia Rugby Union, which governed the sport in Nova Scotia and the Maritimes, decided to adopt the rugby league code in hopes of saving rugby from the incursion of Canadian football. The switch was first discussed in 1945, but the lack of a rule book precluded any action. The switch was finally agreed upon in 1946, and the switch was made the following season.http://www.canadarugbyleague.com/history/index.php?pageid=1000018 With the exception of Halifax schools, which had adopted football, all competitions in the Maritimes, ‚Äì the senior level, Maritime, high school, and university competitions ‚Äì made the switch to rugby league. Unlike most rugby league competitions, the NSRU continued to be recognized by the Canadian Rugby Football Union, and all players remained amateur. Though attendance and participation increased in the first year, it did not last, and football continued to increase in popularity throughout the Maritimes. The universities all switched to football by 1955, and the senior league shrank to just four teams. Rugby league continued to be played in many Nova Scotia high schools until 1959, and was still played elsewhere in the Maritimes into the 1960s, but disappeared thereafter. =Revival= In the 1980s interest in amateur rugby league returned, and in 1986 a new competition, the Tri-Counties Rugby League, was established. Four teams competed in its first year, three from Canada, and one from the U.S., the New York-based Adirondacks club. Later, the Canada national rugby league team was formed, and participated semi-regularly in international competition from 1987‚Äì2000. The team competed in the 2000 Emerging Nations Tournament, but afterward went dormant as the governing body folded. Thereafter Canada's rugby league participation dwindled, though there were two regional rugby league nines tournaments as recently as 2003, one in Ontario and one in Manitoba. In 2010, a new organization, Canada Rugby League, was formed with the intention of reviving the national team and building a new domestic competition. Under the CRL the national team played international games several times in 2010, including the American National Rugby League's annual \\"War at the Shore\\" event, hosting the Colonial Cup, and competing in the Rugby League Atlantic Cup in Jacksonville, Florida. Two domestic teams, the Toronto City Saints and the St. Catharines Bobcats, were established, and are set to be joined by two new teams in 2011. Super League teams St Helens R.F.C. and Salford City Reds have also formed partnerships with Canadian rugby league, and Rugby League Review, one of the leading rugby league magazines around the world came on board as a sponsor of Canadian rugby league. Setanta Sports will broadcast rugby league matches in Canada. Canada won its first international match of the revival era on July 31, 2011 defeating Jamaica 40-10 in Markham, Ontario. In 2016, the 2025 Rugby League World Cup was jointly awarded to Canada and the United States. In 2017, Toronto Wolfpack began play in League 1, the third tier of the British/European rugby league system.http://www.loverugbyleague.com/news_21086-off-the-record-rugby-league- transfer-gossip-25.html They won the League 1 title in their inaugural season, earning promotion to the second-level Championship for 2018. In June 2019, a group of 19 \\"older\\" Rugby League players and 2 supporters made up from around the world, toured to Toronto in Canada to introduce \\"Masters Rugby League\\" to the Canadians. Masters is a modified version of the game of Rugby League and players must be over 35 years of age to play. With no upper age limit, older and players of any ability are all welcome. The Masters format was first played in New Zealand in 1992. By 2004 it was introduced to Australia and to the UK in 2008, France in ca: 2011 and again in 2016, Ireland was next in early 2019). Masters players from traditional Rugby League areas such as Lancashire, Cumbria and Yorkshire joined with players from the less traditional Rugby League areas, such as: The Midlands, London, The South East and The North East of England. With two players Joining from the Southern Hemisphere, (New Zealand and Australia) the tour party was a truly International mix of players from ages 36 to 77, touring under the name ‚ÄúSouth London Silverbacks Masters‚Äù. So with support from The Toronto WolfPack, and some very hardworking and dedicated Rugby League volunteers in Canada, who managed to form two teams as opposition (Toronto Wolfpack Masters and the Ontario Greybeards Masters), the tour went ahead. Two Masters games were played at the Lamport Stadium in Toronto and the tourists were also guests at Barrie High School, spending the day helping Toronto Wolfpack staff with a Rugby League skills day. This tour has ‚ÄúSown the seeds of Masters RL‚Äù in Canada and thanks go to all who volunteered, helped and sponsored the three teams involved. Hopefully Rugby League, Masters and all the other variants of Rugby League will be introduced and/or continue to grow in popularity in Toronto, Canada and North America. Club competition There are currently three (known) domestic competitions in Canada, the Ontario Rugby League Competition, the British Columbia Rugby League Competition and the Alberta Rugby League Competition. In addition to fully domestic leagues, the Toronto Wolfpack began play in the British rugby league system in 2017, initially in League 1. They were promoted to the Championship at the end of the season. After two years in the Championship they were promoted to Super League at the end of the 2019 season. A second Canadian team, the Ottawa Aces, were added to the RFL League system, starting in League 1 in 2021.

She was initially loved by her husband Emperor Cheng, but she eventually lost favor, and as a result of the machinations of her eventual successor, Empress Zhao Feiyan, she was deposed. After she was removed, she tried in vain to regain a measure of dignity by conspiring with her husband's cousin Chunyu Zhang (Ê∑≥‰∫éÈï∑), but that conspiracy would eventually lead to her being forced to commit suicide.  Family background and marriage to then-Crown Prince Ao  Empress Xu was the daughter of Xu Jia (Ë®±Âòâ), the Marquess of Ping'en and the brother of Emperor Xuan's first wife Empress Xu Pingjun, who was the mother of Emperor Yuan. Emperor Yuan frequently grieved for his mother because she was murdered while he was still young by Huo Guang's wife Xian (È°Ø), so he resolved to marry a daughter of the Xu clan to his son, Crown Prince Ao (ÂäâÈ©Å), and he eventually decided on his cousin. When the young couple got married, then- Crown Prince Ao loved his wife dearly. However, they had no children; then- Consort Xu miscarried a male child while her husband was crown prince, and would miscarry a female child when she later became empress, but she would have no births. She was described to have been, unlike even most noble women of the time, well-learned in literature and formal writing.  As empress  In 33 BC, then-Consort Xu's father-in-law Emperor Yuan died, and her husband Crown Prince Ao succeeded to the throne as Emperor Cheng. In 31 BC, he created her empress. He favored her greatly, but also had another favorite, Consort Ban, who also was childless. Because both the empress and Consort Ban lacked children, Emperor Cheng's mother Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun became concerned, and she encouraged him to take on more and more concubines in the hopes of producing an imperial heir, but none would come. Because of the relatively exclusive status that Empress Xu had with regard to Emperor Cheng's affection, the officials also began to become concerned about the lack of an imperial heir. In 28 BC, the Confucian scholar and astrologer Liu Gengsheng (ÂäâÊõ¥Áîü, later named Liu Xiang ÂäâÂêë) submitted a report that suggested that Empress Xu's power be reduced and that the emperor spread his affection to other concubines. In response, Emperor Cheng reduced the budget of the empress' palace. She filed a formal objection with her husband, to which he made a formal reply in the form of an edict upholding the reduction in expenditures. Nevertheless, it did not appear that their relationship was severely strained. However, a decade later, Empress Xu would meet her downfall. Circa 19 BC, when Emperor Cheng was visiting Princess Yang'a (ÈôΩÈòøÂÖ¨‰∏ª), he became enamored with her dancing girl Zhao Feiyan (Ë∂ôÈ£õÁáï) and her sister Zhao Hede (Ë∂ôÂêàÂæ∑) and made them his concubines, and they were favored over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BC, the Zhao sisters falsely accused Empress Xu and Consort Ban of witchcraft; Empress Xu was deposed and put under house arrest in a subsidiary palace. Consort Ban was spared after successfully pleading her case, but she did not wish to return to the same environment and instead became a lady in waiting for Empress Dowager Wang.  After removal as empress  Empress Xu was presumably still given the proper supplies as a former empress, but was distressed about the loss of her status and her freedom. Circa 10 BC, she nade an attempt to better her situation. At that time, her sister Xu Mi, after the death of her husband Han Bao (ÈüìÂØ∂), the Marquess of Long'e, carried on an affair with Emperor Cheng's powerful cousin Chunyu Zhang, who was well-trusted by Emperor Cheng and considered a possible successor to their uncle Wang Gen as the commander of the armed forces. Empress Xu asked her sister to ask Chunyu to intercede on her behalf, and she gave Chunyu many gifts. Her intent was to regain her freedom and again become an imperial consort‚Äîshe was initially not hopeful of regaining her empress status. Chunyu, in order to continue to get gifts from her, deceived her and told her that he would try to have her made \\"left empress\\" ‚Äîi.e., returned to empress status in an inferior role to Empress Zhao. Chunyu had no actual intentions to help her, however. Chunyu himself was in trouble, however, in 8 BC. Wang Gen was ill at the time, and there was speculation that Chunyu would succeed him. Wang Gen's nephew Wang Mang (ÁéãËéΩ), who also wanted to succeed Wang Gen, obtained information about Chunyu's corruption and reported the information to Wang Gen and Empress Dowager Wang, who became so angry that she had Emperor Cheng expel Chunyu from the imperial court and be returned to his march. Chunyu, before he left the capital, gave his horses and luxurious carts to his cousin Wang Rong (ÁéãËûç)‚Äîthe son of his uncle Wang Li (ÁéãÁ´ã), with whom he had a running feud. Wang Li, happy with Chunyu's gift, submitted a petition requesting that Chunyu be allowed to remain at the capital‚Äîwhich drew Emperor Cheng's suspicion because he knew of the feud between Wang Li and Chunyu. He ordered Wang Rong be arrested, and Wang Li, in his panic, ordered his son to commit suicide‚Äîwhich in turn caused Emperor Cheng to become even more suspicious. He therefore had Chunyu arrested and interrogated. Chunyu admitted to how he had deceived Empress Xu and received bribes from her, and he was executed. In the end, Emperor Cheng forced Empress Xu to commit suicide.

The addition of white light will cause a desaturation of the monochromatic source, as perceived by the human eye. However, a less intuitive effect of the white light addition that is perceived by the human eye is the change in the apparent hue. This hue shift is physiological rather than physical in nature. This variance of hue as a result of the addition of white light was first described by the English chemist and physicist Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney in 1909, although the date is commonly reported as 1910. A white light source is created by the combination of red light, blue light, and green light. Sir Abney demonstrated that the cause of the apparent change in hue was the red light and green light that comprise this light source, and the blue light component of white light had no contribution to the Abney effect.W. de W. Abney. ‚ÄúOn the Change in Hue of Spectrum Colours by Dilution with White Light.‚Äù Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character. 83.560 (1909): 120‚Äì127.  Chromaticity diagrams  Chromaticity diagrams are two-dimensional diagrams that plot the projection of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) XYZ color space onto the (x, y) plane. The X, Y, Z values (or tristimulus values) are simply used as weightings to create new colors from the primary colors, much in the same way that RGB is used for creating colors from primaries in televisions or photographs. The x and y values used to create the chromaticity diagram are created from the XYZ values by dividing X and Y by the sum of X, Y, Z. The chromaticity values that can then be plotted are dependent upon two values: dominant wavelength and saturation. Since luminous energy is not included, colors that differ only in its lightness are not distinguished on the diagram. For instance, brown, which is just a low-luminance mixture of orange and red, will not appear as such.Introduction to Chromaticity Diagrams and Color Gamuts The Abney effect can be illustrated on chromaticity diagrams as well. If one adds white light to a monochromatic light, one will obtain a straight line on the chromaticity diagram. We might imagine that the colors along such a line are all perceived as having the same hue. In reality, this does not hold true, and a hue shift is perceived. Correspondingly, if we plot colors that are perceived as having the same hue (and only differing in purity) we will obtain a curved line. In chromaticity diagrams, a line that has constant perceived hue must be curved, so that the Abney effect is accounted for.Widdel H., Lucien D. Color in Electronic Displays. Springer (1992): 21‚Äì23. The chromaticity diagrams that have been corrected for the Abney effect are therefore excellent illustrations of the non-linear nature of the visual system.K. Mantere, J. Parkkinen, and T. Jaaskelainen. ‚ÄúSimulation of white- light adaptation characteristics with use of nonlinear neural principal component analysis‚Äù. Journal of the Optical Society of America. A 14 (1997): 2049‚Äì2056. Also, the Abney effect does not disallow any and all straight lines on chromaticity diagrams. One may mix two monochromatic lights and not see a shift in hue, thereby suggesting a straight-line plot for the different levels of mixture would be appropriate on a chromaticity diagram.Fairchild, M. Color Appearance Models. Wiley Interscience (2005): 117‚Äì119.  Physiology  The opponent process model of the visual system is composed of two chromatic neural channels and one achromatic neural channel.Kulp, T., Fuld, K. ‚ÄúThe Prediction of Hue and Saturation for Non-spectral Lights.‚Äù Vision Res. 35.21 (1995): 2967‚Äì2983. The chromatic channels consist of a red‚Äìgreen channel and a yellow‚Äìblue channel and are responsible for color and wavelength. The achromatic channel is responsible for luminance, or white‚Äìblack detection. Hue and saturation are perceived due to varying amounts of activity in these neural channels consisting of axon pathways from retinal ganglion cells. These three channels are tied closely to reaction time in response to colors. The achromatic neural channel has a faster response time than the chromatic neural channels under most conditions. The functions of these channels are task- dependent. Some activities are dependent on one channel or the other, as well as both channels. When a colored stimulus is summed with white stimulus, both the chromatic and achromatic channels are activated. The achromatic channel will have a slightly slowed response time, since it must adjust to the different luminance; however, despite this delayed response, the speed of the achromatic channel response time will still be faster than the speed of response of the chromatic channel. In these conditions of summed stimuli, the magnitude of the signal emitted by the achromatic channel will be stronger than of the chromatic channel. The coupling of faster response with higher- amplitude signal from the achromatic channel means that reaction time will most likely depend on the luminance and saturation levels of the stimuli. The customary explanations for color vision explain the difference in hue perception as elemental sensations that are inherent to the physiology of the observer. However, no specific physiological constraints or theories have been able to explain the response to each unique hue. To this end, both the observer‚Äôs spectral sensitivity and relative number of cone types have proven to not play any significant role in perceiving different hues.Shevell, S. K. ‚ÄúRelating cone signals to color appearance: Failure of monotonicity in yellow/blue.‚Äù Visual Neuroscience. 18.6 (2001): 901‚Äì906. Perhaps the environment plays a larger role in the perception of unique hues than the different physiological features across individuals. This is supported by the fact that color judgments can vary depending on differences in the color environment across long periods of time, but these same chromatic and achromatic judgments are held constant if the color environment is the same, despite aging and other individual physiological factors affecting the retina.Mizokami Y., Werner J., Crognale M., Webster M., ‚ÄúNonlinearities in color coding: Compensating color appearance for the eye‚Äôs spectral sensitivity‚Äù. Journal of Vision. 6 (2006): 996‚Äì1007.  Colorimetric purity  The saturation, or degree of paleness of a color, is related to colorimetric purity. The equation for colorimetric purity is: . In this equation, equals the luminance of the colored light stimulus, is the luminance of the white light stimulus to be mixed with the colored light. The above equation is a way of quantifying the amount of white light that is mixed with the colored light. In the case of pure spectral color, with no white light added, equals one and equals zero. This means colorimetric purity would equal one, and for any case involving the addition of white light, the colorimetric purity, or the value of , would be less than one. The purity of a spectral color stimulus can be altered by adding white, black, or gray stimulus. However, the Abney effect describes the change in colorimetric purity by the addition of white light. In order to determine the effect that changing the purity has on the perceived hue, it is important that purity be the only variable in the experiment; luminance must be kept constant.  Hue discrimination  The term hue discrimination is used to describe the change in wavelength that must be obtained in order for the eye to detect a shift in hue. An expression defines the required wavelength adjustment that must take place. A small (< 2 nm) change in wavelength causes most spectral colors to appear to take on a different hue. However, for blue light and red light, a much larger wavelength shift must occur in order for a person to be able to identify a difference in hue.  History  The original article describing the Abney effect was published by Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A in December 1909. He decided to do quantitative research following the discovery that the visual observations of color did not match the dominant colors obtained photographically when using models of fluorescence. A color-measuring apparatus commonly used in experiments in the 1900s was used in conjunction with partially silvered mirrors to split one beam of light into two beams.W. de W. Abney. ‚ÄúMeasurement of Colour Produced by Contrast‚Äù. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. 56.0 (1894): 221‚Äì228. This resulted in two beams of light parallel to one another having the same intensity and color. The beams of light were projected onto a white background, creating patches of light that were squares. The white light was added to one of the patches of colored light, the patch on the right. A rod was inserted in the path of the two beams so that there would be no space in between the colored surfaces. An additional rod was used to create a shadow where the white light scattered onto the patch that was not to receive addition of white light (the patch on the left side). The amount of white light added was determined as one half of the luminosity of the colored light. The red light source, for example, had more white light added than the yellow light source. He began using two patches of red light, and in fact, the addition of white light to the light patch on the right caused a more yellow tone than the pure red light source. The same results happened when the experimental light source was orange. When the light source was green, the addition of white light caused the appearance of the patch to become yellow- green. Subsequently, when white light was added to yellow-green light, the patch of light appeared primarily yellow. In a mixture of blue-green light (with a slightly higher percentage of blue) with white light, the blue appeared to take on a reddish hue. In the case of a violet light source, the addition of white light caused the violet light to take on a blue tint. Sir Abney hypothesized that the resulting change in hue that occurred was due to the red light and green light that were components of the white light being added. He also thought that the blue light that also comprises the white light beam was a negligible factor that had no effect on the apparent hue shift. Sir Abney was able to prove his hypothesis experimentally by matching his experimental values of percentage composition and luminosities of red, green, and blue sensations to the calculated values almost exactly. He examined the percentage composition and luminosity found in the different spectral colors as well as the white light source that was added.  A new take on the Abney effect  While the nonlinearity of neural color-coding, as evidenced by the classical understanding of the Abney effect and its use of white light to particular wavelengths of light, has been thoroughly studied in the past, a new method was undertaken by researchers at the University of Nevada. Rather than adding white light to monochromatic light, the bandwidth of the spectrum was varied. This variation of bandwidth directly targeted the three classes of cone receptors as a means of identifying any hue shifts as perceived by the human eye.Webster, M., Mizokami, Y., Werner, J., & Crognale, M. A. ‚ÄúHue constancy across changes in spectral purity and a functional theory of the Abney Effect‚Äù. Journal of Vision. 5.12 (2005):36, 36a. The overall goal of the research was to determine whether the appearance of color was affected by the filtering effects of the spectral sensitivity of the eye. Experiments showed that the cone ratios signaled a hue was adjusted so as to produce a constant hue that matched the central wavelength of the light source. Also, the experiments conducted essentially showed that the Abney effect does not hold for all changes in light purity, but is limited very much to certain means of purity degradation, namely the addition of white light. Since the experiments undertaken varied the bandwidth of the light, a similar albeit different means of altering the purity and therefore hue of the monochromatic light, the nonlinearity of the results displayed differently from what had traditionally been seen. Ultimately, the researchers came to the conclusion that variations in spectral bandwidth cause postreceptoral mechanisms to compensate for the filtering effects imposed by cone sensitivities and preretinal absorption and that the Abney effect occurs because the eye has, in a sense, been tricked into seeing a color that would not naturally occur and must therefore approximate the color. This approximation to compensate for the Abney effect is a direct function of the cone excitations experienced with a broadband spectrum. Miscellaneous facts A patent for a color printer that claims to compensate for the Abney effect was published in 1995.Color printing method and apparatus which compensates for Abney effect. The Abney effect must be taken into account when designing the cockpit for modern fighter planes. The colors viewed on the screen become desaturated when white light strikes the screen, so special considerations are made to counteract the Abney effect. A wide array of spectral colors exist that can be made to exactly match a pure color by adding various levels of white light.Pridmore, R. ‚ÄúBezold‚ÄìBr√ºcke effect exists in related and unrelated colors and resembles the Abney effect.‚Äù Color Research and Application. 29.3 (2004): 241‚Äì246 It remains unknown whether the Abney effect is a resulting phenomenon that occurs by chance during color perception or the effect plays a deliberate function in the way the eye codes for color.

Sea spray contains both organic matter and inorganic salts that form sea salt aerosol (SSA). SSA has the ability to form cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and remove anthropogenic aerosol pollutants from the atmosphere. Sea spray is directly (and indirectly, through SSA) responsible for a significant degree of the heat and moisture fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean, affecting global climate patterns and tropical storm intensity. Sea spray also influences plant growth and species distribution in coastal ecosystems and increases corrosion of building materials in coastal areas.  Generation  = Formation = Connection between sea foam and sea spray formation. The dark orange line indicates processes common to the formation of both sea spray and sea foam. When wind, whitecaps, and breaking waves mix air into the sea surface, the air regroups to form bubbles, floats to the surface, and bursts at the air-sea interface. When they burst, they release up to a thousand particles of sea spray, which range in size from nanometers to micrometers and can be expelled up to 20 cm from the sea surface. Film droplets make up the majority of the smaller particles created by the initial burst, while jet droplets are generated by a collapse of the bubble cavity and are ejected from the sea surface in the form of a vertical jet. In windy conditions, water droplets are mechanically torn off from crests of breaking waves. Sea spray droplets generated via such a mechanism are called spume droplets and are typically larger in size and have less residence time in air. Impingement of plunging waves on sea surface also generates sea spray in the form of splash droplets . The composition of the sea spray depends primarily on the composition of the water from which it is produced, but broadly speaking is a mixture of salts and organic matter. Several factors determine the production flux of sea spray, especially wind speed, swell height, swell period, humidity, and temperature differential between the atmosphere and the surface water. Production and size distribution rate of SSAs are thus sensitive to the mixing state. A lesser studied area of sea spray generation is the formation of sea spray as a result of rain drop impact on the sea surface . = Spatial variation = In addition to the local conditions that influence sea spray formation, there are also consistent spatial patterns in sea spray production and composition. Because sea spray is generated when air is mixed into the ocean, formation gradients are established by turbulence of the surface water. Wave action along coastal shorelines is generally where turbulence is greatest, so this is where sea spray production is the highest. Particles generated in turbulent coastal areas can travel horizontally up to 25 km within the planetary boundary layer. As distance from shore decreases, sea spray production declines to a level sustained almost exclusively by white caps. The proportion of the ocean surface area that is turbulent enough to produce significant sea spray is called the white cap fraction. The only other production mechanism of sea spray in the open ocean is through direct wind action, where strong winds actually break the surface tension of the water and lift particles into the air. However, particles of seawater generated in this way are often too heavy to remain suspended in the atmosphere and usually are deposited back to the sea within a few dozen meters of transport. =Temporal variation = During winter months, the ocean typically experiences stormy, windy conditions that generate more air inundation into the sea and therefore more sea spray. Calmer summer months result in lower overall production of sea spray. During peak primary productivity in the summer, increased organic matter in the surface ocean drives subsequent increases in sea spray. Given that sea spray retains the properties of the water from which it was produced, the composition of sea spray experiences extreme seasonal variation. During the summer, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can constitute 60-90% of sea spray mass. Even though much more sea spray is produced during the stormy winter season, the composition is nearly all salt because of the low primary production. = Organic matter = The organic matter in sea spray consists of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and even microbes themselves, like bacteria and viruses. The amount of organic matter in sea spray depends on microbiological processes, though the total effect of these processes is still unknown. Chlorophyll-a is often used as a proxy for primary production and organic matter content in sea spray, but its reliability for estimating DOC concentrations is controversial. Biomass often enters sea spray through the death and lysis of algal cells, often caused by viral infections. Cells are broken apart into DOC that is propelled into the atmosphere when surface bubbles pop. When primary productivity peaks during the summer, algal blooms can generate an enormous amount of organic matter that is eventually incorporated into sea spray. In the right conditions, aggregation of the DOC can also form surfactant or sea foam.  Climate interactions  At high winds the droplet evaporation layer (DEL) influences the surface energy heat exchange of the ocean. The latent heat flux of sea spray generated at the DEL has been cited as an important addition to climate modeling efforts, particularly in simulations assessing air/sea heat balance as related to hurricanes and cyclones formed during high wind events. During the formation of whitecaps, sea spray droplets exhibit the same properties as the ocean surface, but rapidly adapt to surrounding air. Some sea spray droplets immediately reabsorb into the sea while others evaporate entirely and contribute salt particles like dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to the atmosphere where they can be transported via turbulence to cloud layers and serve as CCN. The formation of these CCN like DMS have climate implications as well, due to their influence on cloud formation and interaction with solar radiation. Additionally, the contribution of sea spray DMS to the atmosphere is linked to the global sulfur cycle. Understanding total forcing from natural sources like sea spray can illuminate critical constraints posed by anthropogenic influence and can be coupled with ocean chemistry, biology and physics to predict future ocean and atmospheric variability. The proportion of organic matter in sea spray can impact reflectance, determine the overall cooling effect of SSAs, and slightly alter the capacity for SSAs to form CCN (17). Even small changes in SSA levels can affect the global radiation budget leading to implications for global climate. SSA has a low albedo, but its presence overlaid on the darker ocean surface affects absorption and reflectance of incoming solar radiation. = Enthalpy flux = The influence of sea spray on the surface heat and moisture exchange peaks during times of greatest difference between air and sea temperatures. When air temperature is low, sea spray sensible heat flux can be nearly as great as the spray latent heat flux at high latitudes. In addition, sea spray enhances the air/sea enthalpy flux during high winds as a result of temperature and humidity redistribution in the marine boundary layer. Sea spray droplets injected into the air thermally equilibrate ~1% of their mass. This leads to the addition of sensible heat prior to ocean reentry, enhancing their potential for significant enthalpy input. =Dynamic effects= The effects of sea spray transport in the atmospheric boundary layer is not yet completely understood . Sea spray droplets alter the air-sea momentum fluxes by being accelerated and decelerated by the winds . In hurricane-force winds, it is observed that there is some reduction in the air/sea momentum flux . This reduction in momentum flux manifests as saturation of air/sea drag coefficient. Some studies have identified spray effects as one of the potential reasons for the air/sea drag coefficient saturation. It has been shown through several numerical and theoretical studies that sea spray, if present in significant amounts in the atmospheric boundary layer, leads to saturation of air-sea drag coefficients.  Ecology  = Coastal ecosystems = Salt deposition from sea spray is the primary factor influencing distribution of plant communities in coastal ecosystems. Ion concentrations of sea spray deposited on land generally mirror their concentrations in the ocean, except that potassium is often higher in sea spray. Deposition of salts on land generally decreases with distance from the ocean but increases with increasing wind speed. Salt deposition from sea spray is correlated with a decrease in plant height and significant scarring, shoot reduction, stem height decrease, and tissue death on the windward side of shrubs and trees. Variation in salt deposition also influences competition between plants and establishes gradients of salt tolerance. While the salts within sea spray can severely inhibit plant growth in coastal ecosystems, selecting for salt-tolerant species, sea spray can also bring vital nutrients to these habitats. For example, one study showed that sea spray in Wales, UK delivers roughly 32 kg of potassium per hectare to coastal sand dunes each year. Because dune soils leach nutrients very quickly, sea spray fertilization could be very influential to dune ecosystems, especially for plants that are less competitive in nutrient-limited environments. = Microbial communities = Sea spray containing marine microorganisms can be swept high into the atmosphere where they become aeroplankton. These airborne microorganisms may travel the globe before falling back to earth. Viruses, bacteria, and plankton are ubiquitous in sea water, and this biodiversity is reflected in the composition of sea spray. Generally speaking, sea spray has slightly lower concentrations of microbes than the water it is produced from. However, the microbial community in sea spray is often distinct from nearby water and sandy beaches, suggesting that some species are more biased towards SSA transportation than others. Sea spray from one beach can contain thousands of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Nearly 10,000 different OTUs have been discovered in sea spray just between San Francisco, CA and Monterey, CA, with only 11% of them found ubiquitously. This suggests that sea spray in every coastal region likely has its own unique assemblage of microbial diversity, with thousands of new OTUs yet to be discovered. Many of the more common OTUs have been identified to the following taxa: Cryptophyta (order), Stramenopiles (order) and OM60 (family). Many have even been identified to genus: Persicirhabdus, Fluviicola, Synecococcus, Vibrio, and Enterococcus. Scientists have conjectured a stream of airborne microorganisms circles the planet above weather systems but below commercial air lanes.Living Bacteria Are Riding Earth‚Äôs Air Currents Smithsonian Magazine, 11 January 2016. Some of these peripatetic microorganisms are swept up from terrestrial dust storms, but most originate from the marine microorganisms in sea spray. In 2018 a team of scientists reported that hundreds of millions of viruses and tens of millions of bacteria are deposited daily on every square meter around the planet.  Chemical resistance  Sea spray is largely responsible for corrosion of metallic objects near the coastline, as the salts accelerate the corrosion process in the presence of abundant atmospheric oxygen and moisture. Salts do not dissolve in air directly, but are suspended as fine particulates, or dissolved in microscopic airborne water droplets. The salt spray test is a measure of material endurance or resistance to corrosion, particularly if the material will be used outdoors and must perform in a mechanical load bearing or otherwise critical role. These results are often of great interest to marine industries, whose products may suffer extreme acceleration of corrosion and subsequent failure due to salt water exposure.

In the U.K., the Contracts Act of 1999, the Digital Economy Act 2010, and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act of 2013 opened the door to revisions of the established practices in the area of publishing contracts which are currently underway.Owen, Lynette (Ed.). Clark's Publishing Agreements: A Book of Precedents. Haywards Heath, West Sussex: Bloomsbury Professional, 2013. Therefore,  Types of music publishing agreements  It is important for music authors, producers and publishers to understand the legal rights associated with publishing contracts.Petty, Shannon and Robert Graff. ‚ÄúA Song in my Heart, and Money in my Pocket‚Äù A Songwriter‚Äôs Primer on a Sample Publishing Contract. Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, Business Council of Greater Philadelphia, 2005-2008. Accessed on 31 January 2014. The common music publishing contracts are: (1) Single Song Agreement: A single song deal is an agreement between the writer and the music publisher in which the writer grants certain rights to a publisher for one or more songs. In single song deals, the writer is paid a one-time recoupable advance.Music Publishing Contracts. Songstuff Site. Accessed on 31 January 2014. (2) Exclusive Song Writer Agreement (\\"ESWA\\") / \\"Publishing Deal\\": Under the ESWA or \\"staff writer\\" contract, the songwriter generally grants all of the songwriter's share of the income to the music publisher. The writer's services are exclusive to the music publishers for a specified period of time. Thus, any compositions written within that period belong to the music publisher. These deals are usually offered to writers with some degree of success. Because the writer has a track record of writing hits, the publisher feels confident that it will recoup its investment. In return for signing away exclusive rights to some or all the writer's songs, the writer gets paid by the publisher a negotiated advance against future royalties. The advance amount naturally depends on the writer's bargaining power and on the competition in marketplace, if any. Under a staff writer deal, the writer is paid on a weekly or quarterly basis. An ESWA can be either tied to a record contract, or independent of a record contract. (3) Co- publishing Agreement (\\"Co-pub\\"): The co-publishing (\\"co-pub\\") deal is perhaps the most common publishing agreement. Under this deal, the songwriter and the music publisher are \\"co-owners\\" of the copyrights in the musical compositions. The writer becomes the \\"co-publisher\\" (i.e. co-owner) with the music publisher based on an agreed split of the royalties. The songwriter assigns an agreed percentage to the publisher, usually (but not always), a 50/50 split. Thus, the writer conveys _ of the publisher's share to the publisher, but retains all of writer's share. In a typical \\"75/25 co-pub deal,\\" the writer gets 100% of the songwriter's share, and 50% of the publisher's share, or 75% of the entire copyrights, with the remaining 25% going to the publisher. Thus, when royalties are due and payable, the writer/co-publisher will receive 75% of the income, while the publisher will retain 25%. -To Understand Deeper \\"In royalty payments, there‚Äôs a writers share and a publisher‚Äôs share. To make things easy, let‚Äôs say each share is worth 100%. So the writer has a pie chart of 100% and the publisher has a pie chart of 100%. If there are multiple writers on the track, then they will split the shares accordingly, 50/50 or 25/25/25/25 if there were 4 writers. After the writers share is calculated, you can calculate the publisher‚Äôs share or vice versa. A record label would usually own 100% of an artist‚Äôs publishing rights, but if you enter into a co- publishing deal, then the label would only get 50% of your publishing. To break it all down, if an artist negotiated a 50/50 split for publishing, and retains 100% of the writers share, then the artist would get half of the publisher‚Äôs share and 100% of the writers share. This would be equal to 75% of the total royalty payment. If you publish your own music, this means you get to keep 100% of your royalties...\\" (4) Administration Agreement (\\"Admin\\"): An administrative agreement takes place between a songwriter/publisher and an independent administrator, or between a writer/publisher and another music publisher. In an \\"admin deal,\\" the songwriter self-publishes and merely licenses songs to the music publisher for a term of years and for an agreed royalty split. Under this agreement, the music publisher simply administers and exploits the copyrights for another publisher/copyright owner. Only the most popular songwriters can even consider asking for an admin deal. Under this coveted arrangement, ownership of the copyright is usually not transferred to the administrator. Instead, the music publisher gets 10-20% of the gross royalties received from administering and exploiting the songs for a certain period of time and for a certain territory. (5) Collection Agreement: A collection agreement is like an admin deal where the writer retains the copyrights, except that the publisher does not perform exploitation functions; like an accountant or business manager, it merely collects and disburses available royalty income. (6) Sub-publishing Agreement: These are basically music publishing deals in foreign territories between a US publisher and a publisher in a foreign territory. They are like admin or collection deals (with no ownership of the copyrights being transferred to the subpublisher), but limited to one or more countries outside the US.

During this time the Chancery Standard, a form of London- based English became widespread and the printing press regularized the language. Between the 1470s and the middle of the following century there was a transition to early Modern English. In literary terms, the characteristics of the literary works written did not change radically until the effects of the Renaissance and Reformed Christianity became more apparent in the reign of King Henry VIII. There are three main categories of Middle English literature, religious, courtly love, and Arthurian, though much of Geoffrey Chaucer's work stands outside these. Among the many religious works are those in the Katherine Group and the writings of Julian of Norwich and Richard Rolle. After the Norman conquest of England, Law French became the standard language of courts, parliament, and society. The Norman dialects of the ruling classes mixed with the Anglo-Saxon of the people and became Anglo-Norman, and Anglo- Saxon underwent a gradual transition into Middle English. Around the turn of the thirteenth century, Layamon wrote in Middle English. Other transitional works were popular entertainment, including a variety of romances and lyrics. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in Parliament and courts of law. Early examples of Middle English literature are the Ormulum and Havelock the Dane. In the fourteenth century major works of English literature began once again to appear, including the works of Chaucer. The latter portion of the 14th century also saw the consolidation of English as a written language and a shift to secular writing. In the late 15th century William Caxton printed four-fifths of his works in English, which helped to standardize the language and expand the vocabulary. Early period After the Norman conquest of England, the written form of the Old English language continued in some monasteries but few literary works are known from this period. Under the influence of the new aristocracy, Law French became the standard language of courts, parliament, and polite society. As the invaders integrated, their language and literature mingled with that of the natives. The Norman dialects of the ruling classes became Anglo-Norman, and Old English underwent a gradual transition into Middle English. Political power was no longer in English hands, so the West Saxon literary language had no more influence than any other dialect. Middle English literature is written, then, in the many dialects that correspond to the history, culture, and background of the individual writers. While Anglo- Norman or Latin was preferred for high culture and administration, English literature by no means died out, and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language. Around the turn of the thirteenth century, Layamon wrote his Brut, based on Wace's twelfth century Anglo-Norman epic of the same name. Layamon's language is recognisably Middle English, though his prosody shows a strong Old English influence remaining. Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment, including a variety of romances and lyrics. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in Parliament and courts of law. Early examples of Middle English literature are the Ormulum, Havelock the Dane, and Thomas of Hales's Love Rune. The Mercian dialect thrived between the 8th and 13th centuries and was referred to by John Trevisa, writing in 1387:Elmes, Simon (2005) Talking for Britain: a journey through the nation's dialects . London: Penguin Books (Word 4 word: the voices survey \\\\ BBC). > \\"For men of the est with men of the west, as it were undir the same partie > of hevene, acordeth more in sownynge of speche than men of the north with > men of the south, therefore it is that Mercii, that beeth men of myddel > Engelond, as it were parteners of the endes, understondeth better the side > langages, northerne and southerne, than northerne and southerne > understondeth either other‚Ä¶\\" Not much lyrical poetry of the thirteenth century remains, and even fewer secular love poems; \\"Foweles in the frith\\" is one exception. Late period A page from the Auchinleck Manuscript which contains a large collection of Middle English poetry It was with the fourteenth century that major works of English literature began once again to appear; these include the so-called Pearl Poet's Pearl, Patience, Cleanness, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; Langland's political and religious allegory Piers Plowman; John Gower's Confessio Amantis; and the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, the most highly regarded English poet of the Middle Ages, who was seen by his contemporaries as an English successor to the great tradition of Virgil and Dante. Far more manuscripts of the Prick of Conscience than any other Middle English poem survive, however.James H. Morey (ed.),Prik of Conscience, TEAMS Middle English Texts Series (Kalamazoo, MI: Medieval Institute Publications, 2012) The Kildare Poems are a rare example of Middle English literature produced in Ireland, and give an insight into the development of Irish English. The latter portion of the 14th century also saw not only the consolidation of English as a written language, taking over from French or Latin in certain areas, but a large shift from primarily theological or religious subject matter to also include that of a more secular nature. Vernacular book production saw a growth in the number of books being copied, both secular and religious. Thus, the latter portion of the 14th century can be seen as one of the most significant periods in the history of the English language.Penn, Stephen (2005) ‚ÄúLiteracy and Literary Production‚Äù in Chaucer: an Oxford guide, ed. Ellis, Steve (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 113-130 The reputation of Chaucer's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him, though Lydgate, Thomas Hoccleve, and Skelton are widely studied. At this time the origins of Scottish poetry began with the writing of The Kingis Quair by James I of Scotland. The main poets of this Scottish group were Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, and Gavin Douglas. Henryson and Dunbar introduced a note of almost savage satire, which may have owed something to the Gaelic bardic poetry, while Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid is one of the early monuments of Renaissance literary humanism in English. It was a vibrant time for religious drama as well: many morality plays and miracle plays were produced, and some scripts survive today. Sidrak and Bokkus is another example of late Middle English literature. =Caxton and the English language= In the late 15th century the first English printer, William Caxton, printed four- fifths of his works in English. He translated a large number of works into English; Caxton translated 26 of the titles himself. Caxton is credited with printing as many as 108 books, 87 of which were different titles. However, the English language was changing rapidly in Caxton's time and the works he was given to print were in a variety of styles and dialects. Caxton was a technician rather than a writer and he often faced dilemmas concerning language standardisation in the books he printed. (He wrote about this subject in the preface to his Eneydos.Caxton's Chaucer - Caxton's English) His successor Wynkyn de Worde faced similar problems. Caxton is credited with standardising the English language (that is, homogenising regional dialects) through printing. This facilitated the expansion of English vocabulary, the development of inflection and syntax and the ever-widening gap between the spoken and the written word. However, Richard Pynson, a Frenchman who started printing in London in 1491 or 1492 and who favoured Chancery Standard English, was a more accomplished stylist and consequently pushed the English language even further toward standardisation.

His highest score was 253 and his best bowling was 7/63, both against South Australia in the 1964-65 season. In the domestic Sheffield Shield competition he played 91 matches, scoring 5,602 runs at 39.73 and taking 110 wickets at 32.81.

Swanton, Swanton in Australia with MCC > 1946‚Äì1975, p.135, Fontana/Collins, 1975 :E.W. Swanton Walters made his debut in Test cricket on 10 December 1965 at the Gabba against England in the 1965-66 Ashes series and quickly developed a reputation as a batsman who could 'make things happen' with a moment of brilliance on an important occasion. He scored 155 in his first Test innings and another century in his second Test. He was not at his best in the subsequent tour of England, averaging only 25.68 in 18 matches there, but elsewhere he was a quick-scoring batsman. Walters was denied an opportunity to tour South Africa in 1966-67 when he was conscripted to two years of National Service training, although effectively being exempted from Vietnam service in order to pursue his professional, cricketing career in Australia, and it wasn't until 1968 that he returned to the test arena. In the 1968-69 series against the West Indies, Walters was injured and unavailable for the first Test match, but in the remaining four Tests he scored a Bradman-like 699 runs, at an average of 116.5, with a highest score of 242 (in the process he became the first player to score a century and a double century in a single Test). In 1969-70 he showed a weakness against the South African fast bowlers Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, ducking while leaving his bat upright like a submarine periscope.David Frith, Pageant of Cricket, p.505, The Macmillan Company of Australia Ltd, 1987 This weakness was exploited by England's John Snow in the 1970-71 Ashes Series, who repeatedly sent down fast, short-pitched balls against Walters. Even so, Walters made 205 not out for New South Wales against the tourists, 112 in the First Test and three fifties thereafter, but few runs in between, making 373 runs (37.30) in the series. Walters starred in an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by Gary Sobers that toured in 1971-72 as a replacement for the politically-unacceptable South Africans, scoring 355 runs in four matches at an average of 71.00, with two centuries. He famously hit a century in a session at the WACA against England in 1974, where he hit Bob Willis for six from the last ball of the day to bring up his ton. He missed the entire series when Australia beat West Indies 5-1 in Australia in 1975-76 due to an injury, but was soon back in the side. His 250 against New Zealand in 1977 is the highest by any batsman in the number six position. Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced \\"Golden Arm\\" broke many partnerships and yielded 49 Test wickets at 29.08.Ian Chappell, Austin Robertson and Paul Rigby, Chappelli Has the Last Laugh, pp.10-11, Lansdowne Press, 1980, He wore the large sideburns popular in the 1960s and ‚Äò70s and when not on the field was seldom seen without a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth. He was also famous for his laconic humour.Ian Chappell, Austin Robertson and Paul Rigby, Chappelli Has the Last Laugh, Lansdowne Press, 1980 The Doug Walters Stand at the Sydney Cricket Ground (opened 1985, demolished 2007) was named after him. There is currently a bar in the Victor Trumper Stand named after him. He was a Channel Nine cricket commentator in the 1987/88 season. In 1988, he wrote One for the Road which is a combination of stories and anecdotes from his early and later cricketing days. He later co-wrote a book, The Entertainers, with Mark Waugh in 1999.

R. Myers High School is located in Taber, Alberta, Canada. Founded in 1950, it is the town's only public high school. Students at W.R. Myers range from grade 9 to grade 12. Taber's middle school, D.A. Ferguson, shares a Cafeteria and a band room with W.R. Myers. The school has about 480 students and 50 staff members both teachers and others. W.R. Myers has had a large success in Sports and Music, creating a name for itself in Western Canada. The Basketball team and the WR Myers Fighting Rebels Football team has brought much success to the school. The school is widely known for the shooting that took place on April 28, 1999 leaving 1 student dead and a second wounded. History The new Taber High School opened its doors to students September 1950. Grades 10-12 moved into twenty classrooms equipped with a science lab, Two Home Economics rooms, one for homemaking the other for sewing, and Industrial Arts room with a small theatre, and a cafeteria with a kitchen. The structure, which cost about $200,000 to build, was to house 450 students. In 1960 a Junior High wing and fine arts room, dubbed the \\"Lemon Squeezer\\" was constructed on the north end of the high school. The addition included two large gymnasiums, one for the Junior High grade 7-8 classes and one for the Senior High, a library and an office. At the time the new Junior/Senior High complex was named W.R Myers School in honour of Walter Ray Myers, a 27-Year school trustee. It was at this time that classes in the junior high school became departmentalized with one home room teacher and other individual teacher's instructing specific courses such as one for Math and one for Social, etc. For nearly twenty years W.R Myers School saw little change except for a few cosmetic improvements and additions. Two air force hangars were moved just east of the school after World War II. One had three grade one classes in it, the other was the auditorium/gymnasium. Later, the grade one building became the industrial Arts shop. When the new gyms were completed at the Myers complex one of the hangars was moved to Cranford to be used as a community hall. A permanent Industrial Arts wing was added to the high school, and the air force hangar became a maintenance shop for the Taber School Division. Soon a Home Economics wing was added. It ran parallel to the Industrial arts wing. It was two story additions with a library; a visual aids room and business education classrooms. In the early 1970s, an Integrated Occupations Program for Junior and Senior High students was organized to accommodate students wanting to learn a trade rather than go to university. Students were being bussed from out-lying areas and there were many graduates working through their programs. In 1981, the two schools split, the north end becoming Taber Junior High for grades 7-9 and grades 10-12 becoming W.R. Myers High School. With unexpected death of Junior High Principal, Donald A. Ferguson in 1985, the name was changed to D.A Ferguson Junior High. It was at that time that grade 6 classes were moved from the central school because of overcrowding. By 1990, the grade 9 classes were moved to the high school and by 1994 D.A Ferguson had become D.A Ferguson Middle School housing grades 6-8, with W.R. Myers housing grades 9-12. The school got a completely modern look when it underwent renovations. This included adding administration space, new library space that would be used for junior and senior high students, and an enclosed concourse hall along the east side of the school, a new ornamental fa√ßade at the entrance, and other changes to better utilize the school's space. By 2002 courses in multimedia were introduced after cable wiring was installed. The school gained notoriety after the April 28, 1999 W. R. Myers High School shooting, only eight days after the Columbine High School massacre. A 14-year-old former student of the school entered the school and shot two students, killing one and wounding another.CBC News.

It was written by the singer, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, and co- produced by the former two. It was released as a CD single in the United States on September 4, 2001. \\"U Got It Bad\\" is an R&B; ballad that, according to MTV, incorporates \\"digi-coustic\\" guitars, a \\"slow-burning bass line\\" and \\"sex funk\\" drums. The lyrics notably contain some quick direct allusions to other soul music ballads, mainly Maxwell's \\"Fortunate\\" and Prince's \\"Adore\\". \\"U Got It Bad\\" topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for one week before being replaced for four weeks by Nickelback's \\"How You Remind Me\\". \\"U Got It Bad\\" then returned to number one, going on to stay atop for five consecutive weeks. With the song and previous single \\"U Remind Me\\", Usher was the only solo male act of 2001 to have a number-one hit on the Hot 100. The accompanying music video features TLC's Chilli as Usher's love interest. Background and writing \\"U Got It Bad\\" was written by Usher, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan- Michael Cox. It was produced by the former and co-produced by the latter. Recording was done by Brian Frye and mixing by Dupri and Phil Tan, at Southside Studios, Atlanta, Georgia in 2000. John Horesco IV provided mixing assistance, William \\"Billy\\" Odum performed the Guitar and Usher provided all vocals. The lyrics to the song were, according to Dupri, inspired by a true story. He and Usher were in the studio trying to record some music for the album, but Usher was continually distracted by a girl he had brought into the studio. Following an argument, the girl left. A while later, they started on talking on the phone, which prompted Dupri to kick Usher out of the studio telling him, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do this [session] later on. You got it completely too bad right now. You got it bad.‚Äù This ignited the inspiration for the song, and once Usher had left, Dupri started writing its lyrics, with the notion that it was going to be a big hit. Once Usher had returned to the studio, Dupri shared the story of the song with him. Talking to Complex, Dupri stated that \\"U Got It Bad\\" is another \\"Nice & Slow\\", saying that he produced the song as he wanted to re-produce a track similar to the latter in terms of success, for Usher's 8701 (2001). Composition and release \\"U Got It Bad\\" is an R&B; ballad. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, it is written in the key of D major and has a metronome of 66 beats per minute. Usher's vocal range spans from the low note of F#4 to the high note of A5. The song is actually a semitone lower in the key of D-flat major, which would have the vocals span from F4 to Ab5. \\"U Got It Bad\\" is a slow jam, that makes use of \\"digi-coustic\\" guitars, a \\"slow-burning bass line\\" and \\"sex funk\\" drums. Usher's vocals \\"floats and runs\\" between the song's melody's, before intensifying when entering the chorus. The Neptunes produced track, \\"I Don‚Äôt Know,\\" was initially intended as the album's second single. Rapper P. Diddy was to direct its music video in Los Angeles in July 2001. The song was receiving radio play prior to the release of 8701 first single \\"U Remind Me\\". However, Usher instead released \\"U Got It Bad\\" as the album's second single, as it presents his own unique sound, \\"If you wanna know what a Usher record is, then [\\"U Got It Bad\\" is] it,\\" while using both Michael Jackson and Bobby Brown as examples of artists who \\"solidified\\" their music through their own unique music. \\"U Got it Bad\\" was released as a CD Single in the US on December 18, 2001. Reception \\"U Got It Bad\\" won the 2002 Teen Choice Love Song award. In 2003, the song won an ASCAP Award for Publisher of the Year. Chart performance \\"U Got It Bad\\" topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week of December 15, 2001, becoming Usher's third number-one song on the chart. It was his second Hot 100 number one from 8701 after \\"U Remind Me\\", which reached the position in July of the same year. \\"U Got It Bad\\" marked the first time he obtained two consecutive number one hits. In December 2001, Usher became one of the few Arista acts to have more than one Hot 100 number one hit, with Whitney Houston having eleven, Barry Manilow and Milli Vanilli with three, and Monica and Juelz Santana with two. \\"U Got It Bad\\" was also atop the Hot 100 Airplay chart that week, with an audience impression of 135 million. The following week, the song was replaced by Nickelback's \\"How You Remind Me\\", moving it to number two. Nickelback's single remained number one for four consecutive weeks, before being replaced by \\"U Got It Bad\\" on the week of January 8, 2002, which went on to top the Hot 100 for five weeks. On the same week, the song broke the record for the highest audience impression on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, previously held by Alicia Keys, with 149,858,700 listeners. The song's popularity helped 8701 rise from number twenty-three to eight on the US Billboard 200 on the week of October 11, 2001. Music video TLC member Chilli co-starred as Usher's love interest in the video. A music video for \\"U Got It Bad\\" was directed by Canadian filmmaker Little X. Co- starring TLC member Rozonda \\"Chilli\\" Thomas as the female leaad, the video starts with Usher tossing and turning in bed, troubled by the thought of his ex-girlfriend (Thomas). After awakening, he turns on the TV, only to see his ex, a celebrity on her own, on every station. The video proceeds to introduce flashbacks of happier times between the two, suggesting that he still longs for his ex. In his desperation to find her, he braves the rain, bursting into her trailer to apologize to and reconcile with her. However, this is revealed to be his imagination, and instead of opening the door of the trailer, he walks away ashamed. Disgusted, he makes his way home and lies in his bed, alone. At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Male Video and Best R&B; Video.

Frick led the opposition to the proposed changes which, however, were subsequently approved by the electorate.

Compare manager. Business managers drive the work of others (if any) in order to operate efficiently and (in the case of for-profit companies) to make a profit. Compare: They should have working knowledge of the following areas, and may be a specialist in one or more: finance, marketing and public relations. Other technical areas in which a business manager may have expertise include law, science, and computer programming. In some circumstances, business managers even have oversight over human resources. Role profile In many businesses, the role may be established to relieve the owner of responsibility, in order to focus on specific aspects of company expansion. Typically, the business manager and the owner work may work in synergy to ensure successful running of business. Having a specialization in a particular field, such as sales, marketing, public relations or finance aids in efficiency, yet despite the usual academic qualities of a business manager, business managers also develop personal qualities that are helpful in performing the role efficiently. A social skill of a business manager is the ability to understand and know what each of their subordinate employee's tasks are and how to work with each employee in working toward successful completion of such tasks. A business manager should be willing to accept constructive criticism from employees, develop social skills, be organized, honest and able to take good decisions. A good business manager should be willing to work along his or her employees in order to create a better work environment. Examples in industry In the music industry, a business manager is a representative of musicians or recording artists or both, whose main job is to supervise their business affairs and financial matters. The role largely originated from Allen Klein, who represented numerous performers, helping them to both invest their incomes wisely and to recover unpaid (or underpaid) royalties and fees. Business managers commonly have an overlapping presence in both the entertainment and sports industries, as illustrated by business manager Barry Klarberg, who represents entertainer Justin Timberlake as well professional athletes C.

For a seed to be used in a pseudorandom number generator, it does not need to be random. Because of the nature of number generating algorithms, so long as the original seed is ignored, the rest of the values that the algorithm generates will follow probability distribution in a pseudorandom manner. A pseudorandom number generator's number sequence is completely determined by the seed: thus, if a pseudorandom number generator is reinitialized with the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of numbers. The choice of a good random seed is crucial in the field of computer security. When a secret encryption key is pseudorandomly generated, having the seed will allow one to obtain the key. High entropy is important for selecting good random seed data.Web's random numbers are too weak, researchers warn If the same random seed is deliberately shared, it becomes a secret key, so two or more systems using matching pseudorandom number algorithms and matching seeds can generate matching sequences of non-repeating numbers which can be used to synchronize remote systems, such as GPS satellites and receivers. Random seeds are often generated from the state of the computer system (such as the time), a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator or from a hardware random number generator.

The fineness of its blade allows it to cut more delicately than a power jigsaw, and more easily than a hand coping saw or fretsaw. Like those tools, it is capable of creating curves with edges, by pivoting its table. The scroll saw's name derives from its traditional use in making scrollwork, sculptural ornaments which prominently featured scroll-head designs. Advantages While somewhat similar to a band saw, a scroll saw uses a reciprocating blade rather than a continuous loop. Like a hand coping saw, the scroll saw's blade can be removed and placed through a pre-drilled starting hole, allowing interior cutouts to be made without an entry slot. Also, the fineness in both width and tooth count of a scroll's blade permits significantly more intricate curves than even the narrowest gauge band-saw blade. The majority of scroll saws offer a small light on a flexible arm that illuminates the work area and a dust blower nozzle to keep the work space clear while working. Table-tilting enables angled cuts to be made precisely and easily. Variable-speed support allows even finer control over cuts when working with delicate materials or when making intricate cuts. Size Scroll saws are classified according to the size of their throat, which is the distance from the blade to the rear frame of the saw. The throat depth determines how large a piece of wood can be cut. Smaller saws have a throat of as little as , while commercial saws can approach . Before the era of computer automation, industrial saws were sometimes used to make even larger objects by hanging the top mechanical linkage from the ceiling, thus providing an arbitrarily deep throat. Scroll saws vary in price from under $100 to close to $2,000. The more costly saws are more accurate and easier to use, usually because they minimize vibration, though this is dependent in part upon design and frequency, with many models offering no vibrations in some frequencies, and increased vibration in others. Uses Scroll sawing is a popular hobby for many woodworkers. The tool allows a substantial amount of creativity and requires comparatively little space. In addition, many scroll saw projects require little more than the saw itself, reducing the investment in tools. A drill is required for interior cutouts, preferably a drill press for finely detailed work. Scroll saws are often used to cut intricate curves and joints, a task they can complete quickly and with great accuracy. They can also be used to cut dovetail joints and are a common tool for thicker intarsia projects. When a fine blade is used, the kerf of a scroll saw is almost invisible. Along with band saws, jigsaws, and now recently seen chainsaws, scroll saws are used with modern intarsia. Scroll saws are comparatively safe. In particular, inadvertent contact between the blade and the operator's fingers or limbs is unlikely to result in serious injury, due to a smaller blade and relatively slower speed compared to tools such as a table saw. Mode of operation There are several types of scroll saws. The most common design is the parallel arm, in which a motor is attached near the back of the arms and the two arms always remain parallel to each other. The C-arm variant uses a solid \\"C\\" shaped arm, with the blade being mounted between the two ends of the \\"C\\". The parallel link type, used by Hawk, Excalibur, and DeWalt, has rods in the upper and lower arms that are \\"pushed\\" by the motor to move short (about 4 inches, or 100 millimetres) articulated arms which hold the blade. The rigid arm scroll saw was popular until the 1970s but is no longer made. It has a single-piece cast iron frame. The blade is attached to a pitman arm on the bottom, which pulls the blade down. A spring in the upper arm pulls the blade back up again. This design has a significant weakness in that the tension on the blade changes with every stroke; modern scroll saws are all \\"constant tension\\" designs. Blades Hand-operated scroll saw, around 1900 With the exception of blades made for very light duty saws, typical scroll saw blades are five inches long. The major types are: * Skip tooth (or single skip tooth) which have a tooth, a gap, and then another tooth; * Double skip tooth (two teeth, a gap, then two teeth); * Crown or two-way, which have teeth facing both up and down so that the blade cuts on both the down-stroke (as with all other blades) and the up- stroke; * Spiral blades, which are essentially regular flat blades with a twist, so that teeth project on all sides; * Metal cutting blades made of hardened steel; * Diamond blades (wires coated with diamond fragments), for cutting glass. * Pin end blades are generally a bit thicker and are made to use on scroll saws that require pin end blades which are generally older, less expensive or made for entry level scrollers. Most newer higher-end scroll saws do not accept pin end blades. Blades come in many weights, ranging from #10/0 (for making jewelry‚Äîabout the size of a coarse hair) to #12, which is similar to a small band saw blade. Another variation is called a reverse tooth blade. On reverse tooth blades, the bottom 3/4\\" of the teeth are reversed (point up). This arrangement helps to reduce splintering on the bottom edges of the cut. However, it does not clear sawdust out of the cut as well as a regular blade, so cutting is slower and produces more heat. This heat reduces blade life and makes scorching of the workpiece more likely. Reverse tooth blades are especially useful when cutting softwood and plywood such as Baltic birch. The latest variation is called \\"ultra-reverse\\". These blades are configured with 4‚Äì5 teeth down and then one up, repeated through the length of the blade. The blade clears dust very well and leaves a much cleaner back (very few \\"fuzzies\\"). These blades' sizes range from #1 through #9.  Further reading  * Jensen, Laurits: Billedsk√¶rerbogen, 1986, .

(commonly referred to as BRS Aerospace, or simply BRS) is a manufacturer of aircraft ballistic parachutes. The company was formed in 1980 by Boris Popov of Saint Paul, Minnesota, after he survived a fall in a partially collapsed hang glider in 1975. As a result, Popov invented a parachute system that could lower an entire light aircraft to the ground in the event of loss of control, failure of the aircraft structure, or other in-flight emergencies. Popov was granted a U.S. patent on 26 August 1986 for the so-called Ballistic Recovery System (BRS) - patent US 4607814 A. The company has two divisions: BRS Aviation and BRS Defense. History BRS was founded in 1980 and introduced its first parachute model two years later in 1982, with focus on the ultralight aircraft market. The company recorded its first successful aircraft and crew recovery in 1983: Jay Tipton of Colorado. In 1998 BRS collaborated with Cirrus Design (now called Cirrus Aircraft) to develop the first recovery parachute system to be used on a line of type certified aircraft: the Cirrus SR20, followed by the Cirrus SR22 in 2001. The companies named the design the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), and made it standard equipment on all 7,000+ Cirrus SR aircraft. In 2002 BRS received a supplemental type certificate to install their parachute system in the Cessna 172, followed by the Cessna 182 in 2004 and the Symphony SA-160 in 2006. In response to the economic recession of 2008 and associated falling orders, the company announced in November 2008 that it would lay-off 25% of its workforce for an indefinite time period. Products =Ballistic rescue parachutes= Components A small solid-fuel rocket is used to pull the parachute out from its housing and deploy the canopy fully within seconds. Typically on ultralight installations the rocket is mounted on the parachute container. On larger aircraft installations the rocket may be remotely mounted. Over the years the BRS systems employed have been improved and updated and the current version is the BRS-6. This has a separate rocket installation that can be removed from the parachute so that the parachute can be sent for re-packing without the problems of trying to ship the rocket along with it. Typically the parachute requires repacking every six years and the rocket requires replacing every 12 years. Rescues completed The first ballistic recovery parachutes were on the market in 1982, and the first deployment was in 1983. Between then and April 2007, over 225 people were aboard 201 aircraft which deployed BRS parachutes; most of whose lives were presumably saved by those parachute deployments. As of February 2018, the company's website states that 376 lives have been saved. Development According to the company, it has provided more than 30,000 parachutes for various light and microlight aircraft as of 2017. On 18 July 2008 BRS announced that its new 5000-series canopy had completed compliance testing to ASTM International standards. This new parachute system is intended to provide a recovery capability for much larger aircraft, including very light jets and other light pressurized aircraft. Initial applications may include the Diamond D-Jet, which is currently suspended, and the Lancair Evolution. As of 2008, FAA certification was being pursued to allow installation on certified aircraft. =Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS)= See also *Air safety References External links * * AVweb news article about a 2004 deployment * Youtube video of BRS and Cirrus on How Do They Do It? in 2009 * 2015 Flying magazine article Category:Companies traded over-the-counter in the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Aerospace companies of the United States Category:Companies established in 1980 ","title":"Ballistic Recovery Systems"},{"id":"2503309","text":"Little Fuzzy is a 1962 science fiction novel by H. Beam Piper, now in public domain. It was nominated for the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel. The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient, and features a mild libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty. The book was followed by a sequel, Fuzzy Sapiens (original title The Other Human Race) published in 1964, the same year that Piper committed suicide. In the wake of Piper's suicide, rumor spread of a lost \\"second sequel\\"; in 1981, at the behest of Ace Books, William Tuning produced the critically acclaimed Fuzzy Bones. Ace also hired Ardath Mayhar in 1982 to write Golden Dreams: A Fuzzy Odyssey, which tells the events of Little Fuzzy from the viewpoint of the Fuzzies (or Gashta, as they call themselves). Later, Piper's lost manuscript was discovered, and published in 1984 as Fuzzies and Other People. Wolfgang Diehr wrote or co-wrote three sequels, published by Pequod Press: Fuzzy Ergo Sum (2011), Caveat Fuzzy (2012), and Fuzzy Conundrum (2016, with well-known Piper historian John F. Carr). In 2011, John Scalzi published Fuzzy Nation, which he described as a \\"reboot\\" of Piper's original.\\"The Super Secret Thing That I Cannot Tell You About, Revealed: Introducing Fuzzy Nation\\", post on Scalzi's blog \\"Whatever\\", April 7, 2010 Plot summary Protagonist Jack Holloway lives a solitary life in a wilderness of planet Zarathustra, itself \\"owned\\" by the Chartered Zarathustra Company (under Victor Grego), which installed basic services and colonial outposts initially, and now reaps the benefits of new discoveries, such as the valuable \\"sunstones\\" mined by Holloway until he befriends a tiny, golden- furred humanoid that he names \\"Little Fuzzy\\". Little Fuzzy brings his family/tribe to meet Holloway and the lot of them promptly adopt Holloway as well. Upon discovery that the Fuzzies' intelligence may qualify them as a sapient species, the Company moves against them. The reason for such an action, which if carried through to conclusion would be genocide, is that such a discovery would turn the planet a protected aboriginal zone, install a proper government there, and deprive the Chartered Zarathustra Company of its complete control of the resources there. Leonard Kellogg, one of Grego's staff, kills a Fuzzy and provokes a court case to decide whether the Fuzzies are sapient. In the midst of the proceedings, the Terran Navy commander reveals that his people have been studying Fuzzies, and prove that Fuzzies have at least the mental capacity of a ten-year-old human child. They also show that the \\"yeek\\" noises made by the Fuzzies are merely the human-audible edge of the Fuzzies' voices and that their normal speaking range is in the ultrasonic; and tell the court that they have developed an elementary Fuzzy grammar and dictionary. As a result, the charter of the Chartered Zarathustra Company is invalidated, and Kellogg commits suicide in his cell. Chief Justice Frederic Pendarvis officially rules that the Fuzzies are sapient beings, and Holloway is reunited with his Fuzzy family. The second book, Fuzzy Sapiens, deals with the newly charterless Zarathustra Company and its gradual cooperation with the planet's new governor to ensure chaos does not take over the planet, while the Fuzzies attach themselves to individual human guardians including members of the Company staff. Victor Grego, one of the villains of the first book and the manager of the CZC, finds a Fuzzy in his private apartment in the Company tower, adopts him, names him Diamond, and become a firm supporter of the Fuzzies. This enables the Company to cooperate with the new planetary government headed up by naturalist Ben Rainsford and work with the Native Affairs Commission headed up by Jack Holloway. It becomes clear that criminals are using the irregular status of the government and of the Company to attack it and steal sunstones. With the help of the Fuzzies, the thieves are thwarted. There is also further exploration into the biology of the Fuzzies, and it is established that the Fuzzies may be in a biological dead end, doomed to extinction without aid from the humans. The third book, Fuzzy Bones by William Tuning, suggests that the remarkable affinity of all Fuzzies for the survival ration \\"Extraterrestrial Type Three\\" (a.k.a. \\"Extee 3\\", \\"estefee\\", or \\"hoksu-fusso\\", meaning \\"wonderful food\\") does not coincide with the composition of Zarathustran soil, a contradiction of Garrett's Theorem. A third significant Fuzzy character is developed called Starwatcher. Little Fuzzy, Diamond, and Starwatcher become the clear leaders in working with humans. Among other things, an alien spaceship is discovered on Beta Continent, and evidence that the Fuzzies are not in fact native to Zarathustra emerges, which raises a variety of legal and philosophical questions. Tuning introduces a number of memorable characters, including Christiana Stone, Grego's Fuzzy-Sitter-in-Chief; Reverend Thomas Aquinas Gordon, aka \\"The Rev;\\" Master Gunnery Sergeant Philip Helton, TFMC; and Liana Bell, a CZC scientist invited by the researchers of Holloway's Fuzzy Institute to join them in their research. Golden Dream by Ardath Mayhar fits with these three books in terms of the general plot and relationships. Essentially, it is Little Fuzzy told from the point of view of the Fuzzies rather than that of the humans. After these two official sequels, the original third book by Piper himself, Fuzzies and Other People, offers an alternative future wherein Little Fuzzy himself is separated from Jack Holloway and introduces a band of Fuzzies led by Wise One to the combined society. It explores the deepening relationships between the characters already introduced in Piper's first two books, and shows how the Fuzzies fit in with the humans on Zarathustra.

After an initial activity as a painter, in the 1940s and 1950s he became one of the major collectors of contemporary Italian abstract art, developing a deep relationship of patronage and friendship with the artists. This experience has its pinnacle in the exhibition Modern painters of the Cavellini collection at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome in 1957. In the 1960s Cavellini resumed his activity as an artist, with an ample production spanning from Neo-Dada to performance art to mail art, of which he became one of the prime exponents with the Exhibitions at Home and the Round Trip works. In 1971 he invented autostoricizzazione (self-historicization), upon which he acted to create a deliberate popular history surrounding his existence. He also authored the books Abstract Art (1959), Man painter (1960), Diary of Guglielmo Achille Cavellini (1975), Encounters/Clashes in the Jungle of Art (1977) and Life of a Genius (1989). Biography Guglielmo Achille Cavellini was born in Brescia on 11 September 1914. His parents were from Tuscany, coming from two small villages over Pontremoli, in the Lunigiana. After the marriage and the birth of their first daughter Adele in 1900, they moved to Switzerland where the father worked as a bricklayer, then became a hawker in Lombardy. They lived for some time in Arona, on the Lake Maggiore, where in 1911 their son Mario was born. Then they moved to Brescia, where they opened a store called Bazar 33. In 1918 Adele died from the Spanish flu. Cavellini studied for nine years at the Cesare Arici Jesuit college. At 16 years he started the Istituto tecnico, but he was forced to interrupt his studies to help his parents in the store. Since his childhood he drew and painted, mainly landscapes. In 1935 he met Lisetta, his first girlfriend and future wife. In 1938 in Cortina d'Ampezzo he befriended the painter Domenico Mucci, who gave him painting lessons. In 1941 Cavellini was conscripted in the Second World War, and was sent to an anti-aircraft base in Bergamo. On 11 August 1941 he married Lisetta, then was dismissed from the army because of a peptic ulcer. On 10 September 1942 his daughter Mariella was born, and then Cavellini went back to the army until the end of the war. From 1945 to 1948 he drew and painted frequently. In the same period he visited the Feroldi collection, which included The Disquieting Muses by Giorgio De Chirico, the Lying Nude by Amedeo Modigliani, and works by Giorgio Morandi, Henri Rousseau, Andr√© Derain, Alfred Sisley and Paul C√©zanne. He also visited Venice, where he painted landscapes, and Burano, where he met the painter Filippo De Pisis. At the Procuratie, in front of the Tempest by Giorgione, he met artist Emilio Vedova. Vedova proposed to organize an exhibition in Cavellini's house, with the help of painter Giuseppe Santomaso and art critics Giuseppe Marchiori and Marco Valsecchi. =The collector= The exhibition was successful, and many young artists contacted Cavellini to ask him to show their works. Among them was Renato Birolli, whom Cavellini befriended and from whom he acquired the 86 Drawings of the Resistance and the painting The Woman and the Moon. In December of the same year Birolli and Ennio Morlotti traveled to Paris on a scholarship of the French government. In June 1947 Cavellini met them in Paris with his wife, and there he visited the main museums of the city (the Louvre, the Petit Palais, the Jeu de Paume), the art galleries and the studios of artists Gino Severini, √ìscar Dom√≠nguez, √âdouard Pignon and Henry Adam. He was disheartened by the comparison to the great artists of the past and present, so he decided to abandon painting and work full-time on his commercial activity and on his collection. In the same year he acquired two paintings by Renato Guttuso, and in March 1948 he traveled to Rome because one of his paintings was exhibited at the Rome Quadriennale in the National Gallery of Modern Art in Valle Giulia. There he met Guttuso, whom he befriended, and art critic and historian Lionello Venturi who had just returned to Italy after his exile during Fascism. Venturi recognized the importance of Cavellini's work and in 1953 published an article about him in the daily newspaper La Stampa. Because of his sudden popularity, Cavellini's father and his brother, who was president of the chamber of commerce of the province of Brescia, asked him to avoid contact with artists because they were afraid they might be communists. Despite this Cavellini kept collecting art and visiting artists in Rome in the weekends, especially the home of Guttuso and his studio in the park of Villa Massimo. There he met the artists of the Group of Eight (Afro Basaldella, Antonio Corpora, Giulio Turcato, Alberto Burri, Corrado Cagli, Giuseppe Capogrossi, Pietro Consagra, Nino Franchina, Leoncillo Leonardi and Mimmo Rotella) and acquired many of their works, among them Sacco e nero 3 by Burri. At the following Rome Quadriennale Cavellini bought numerous works by abstract artists like Franchina, Consagra, Corpora and Capogrossi. At the end of 1949, and then again in 1951, he traveled to Paris to acquire works by Hans Hartung, Maurice Est√®ve, Alfred Manessier, Jean Ren√© Bazaine, Gustave Singier, Pierre Tal-Coat, Jean Le Moal, L√©on Gischia and G√©rard Ernest Schneider. Meanwhile, the family store enjoyed great success and expanded, changing its name from Bazar 33 to Grandi Magazzini 33. On 4 February 1946 Cavellini's son Piero was born. In 1950 his brother moved and he was left the entire family villa, which was restructured by architect Mario Baciocchi. Part of the house was transformed into a true art gallery, which was set up by graphic designer AG Fronzoni The house-gallery was inaugurated with the participation of seven artists from the Group of Eight, art critic Giuseppe Marchiori and writer Giancarlo Fusco. In the spring of the same year the gallery was also visited by Katherine Dunham and Josephine Baker. In February 1953 Cavellini travels to Milan to meet Atanasio Soldati, the father of Italian abstract art, shortly before his death, and he acquired two of his paintings. He started to receive the interest of art critics and museum managers, meeting Lionello Venturi, Giulio Carlo Argan, the director of the Louvre, Georges Salles, and museologist Georges Henri Rivi√®re. The magazine XX Siecle, edited by Gualtieri di San Lazzaro, published a long article about Cavellini written by professor Argan. In February 1954 Cavellini traveled to Paris where he met San Lazzaro, acquired paintings by Jean Ren√© Bazaine and Raoul Ubac and met Joan Mir√≥ and gallerist Aim√© Maeght. With the help of San Lazzaro he bought a painting by Alberto Magnelli and 16 drawings by Jean Fautrier. Then he visited the studios of Gerard Ernest Schneider, Jean-Michel Atlan, Jean Dubuffet, Victor Brauner, L√©on Gischia and Andr√©-Pojet. Thanks to Gildo Caputo, director of the Galerie de France, he was able to meet Alfred Manessier and acquire his work Ce qui √©tait perdu. In Paris he met by chance Italian designer Bruno Munari. In 1955 Cavellini's gallery was visited by German art historian Werner Haftmann and by the founder of documenta Arnold Bode, who asked him to contribute to the exhibition. While in Kassel he bought a burning by Alberto Burri. In the same year Cavellini's gallery was visited by art historians Vittorio Viale and Palma Bucarelli, and then by poets Eugenio Montale, Salvatore Quasimodo, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Beniamino Joppolo and French painter Maurice Est√®ve. In January 1956 he went back to Paris where he met San Lazzaro and bought a painting by Serge Poliakoff. He also met Lucio Fontana in his studio in Milan and acquired from him one of his holes, a painting by Osvaldo Licini and one by Asger Jorn. In 1957 Palma Bucarelli asked Cavellini to exhibit at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome, which she managed. The exhibition, titled Modern Painters of the Cavellini Collection, consisted of 180 works and was inaugurated on 24 May 1957 at the presence of Italian Minister of Education Pietro Campilli. The exhibition received positive reviews from, among others, art critics Lionello Venturi, Giulio Carlo Argan, Giuseppe Marchiori and Guido Ballo, and also by Francesco Arcangeli, Attilio Bertolucci, Enrico Crispolti, Maurizio Calvesi and Alfredo Mezio. At the start of 1958 the exhibition moved to La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland, then to Kunsthalle in Basel and finally to Germany at the Staatliche Kunsthalle in Baden-Baden and at the Landolins museum in Esslingen am Neckar. =Abstract Art and Man Painter= On 2 June 1958 Cavellini published his first book Arte astratta (Abstract Art), printed by Giampiero Giani and presented at the Venice Biennale. The book participated in the Viareggio Prize, reaching the final selection. Abstract Art was positively reviewed by Elda Fezzi, Guido Ballo, Giorgio Kaisserlian, Duilio Morosini, Angelo Dragone and Rosanna Apicella. Some pages of Cavellini's diary were published by Alfredo Mezio on the magazine Mondo, directed by Mario Pannunzio. In the summer of the same year he traveled to London with his daughter Mariella, and there he met painter John Latham and bought some of his works. In the same period he visited the exhibitions by Yves Klein at the Apollinaire Gallery in Milan, those by Arman and Shusaku Arakawa at the Arturo Schwarz Gallery in Milan, the group exhibitions by Luciano Pistoi and Michel Tapi√© in Turin and the ones set up by Attilio Codognato in Venice. At one of those exhibitions he met Christo, who then visited Cavellini's home. On 31 May 1960 Cavellini published his second book Uomo pittore (Man Painter), that included his diary and his correspondence with Renato Birolli, who had died on 3 May 1959. In January 1961 Cavellini went back to Paris where he met Georges Mathieu, Jean Fautrier. On 16 and 23 April 1961 he published on L'Europeo his report of the two meetings. In Paris he also met Pierre Alechinsky, Philip Martin and Hisao Domoto. He was also visited in Brescia by Italian painter Tancredi Parmeggiani, who would commit suicide a few years later. In 1960 the Venice Biennale focused on arte informale, awarding Jean Fautrier and Hans Hartung. Cavellini visited the Biennale and met artists Renato Guttuso, Alberto Burri, Emilio Vedova and Luigi Nono. =The artist= In the summer of 1962 Cavellini decided to resume his activity as an artist, initially with dadaist works. He experimented with materials such as imprints of leaves, enamel, blotting paper, collages, toilet paper, razor blades. In 1965 he exhibited a dozen works at the Apollinaire Gallery in Milan. With the help of Giovanni Fiorini he created homages to Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Giorgio Morandi, Joan Mir√≥, Fernand L√©ger and Giorgio De Chirico. He also composed mosaics of painted wood, which he transformed in enormous stamps. Then he started to destroy his works, dissect them and put them in small caged. He also burned his works, creating the Carboni (Carbons), i.e. carbonizzate partly painted with bright colors. At the 1964 Venice Biennale Cavellini made contact with pop art. In the same year the Comune of Brescia decided to exhibit the artworks it owned at the Gallery of Modern Art in Santa Giulia. Cavellini was asked to contribute with some works from his collection, and he deposited 70. The exhibition was inaugurated on 15 November 1964. The contract would last seven years, then Cavellini would take back the works because of poor storage conditions and the missing promotion on the part of the Comune. In October 1965 he travelled to Russia with his son Piero and numerous artists and prominent figures including the Soviet Minister of Culture Yekaterina Furtseva. In 1965 with the advent of arte povera Cavellini met Michelangelo Pistoletto and Giulio Paolini, and acquired works by Mario Merz, Giovanni Anselmo and Gilberto Zorio, and then Luciano Fabro, Piero Gilardi and Jannis Kounellis. In this period Cavellini commissioned the first portraits of himself to authors Renato Birolli, Wolf Vostell, Mario Ceroli, Claudio Costa and Mimmo Rotella. Even American artist Andy Warhol went to Cavellini's house and made a portrait of him. James Collins made a video-portrait. They were followed by the French Bernar Venet and Ben Vautier, by the visual poets Emilio Villa, Ugo Carrega and Ketty La Rocca, and then by Claudio Parmiggiani, Aldo Spinelli, Michele Zaza, Fernando De Filippi, Adriano Altamira, Carlo Pittore and E.F. Higgins III. In 1966 Cavellini made his first trip to the United States, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City, he made a performance by attaching hundreds of pins to his suit. In 1967 his daughter Mariella was married, and for the occasion Cavellini made an exhibition with works of Piero Gilardi, Arman, Allen Jones, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney, Alan Davie, Alberto Burri and Lucio Fontana. He was photographed with the artworks by Danilo Allegri. The following year he made an exhibition with his drawings in the Sturm Palace in Bassano del Grappa. For the first time some of his works, specifically a few of his Carboni, were bought by a collector. In 1970 he decided to promote his art through a series of exhibitions in Italy: first at the Toninelli Gallery in Milan, then in Como at the Salotto Gallery, then in Turin at the Triade Gallery, in Trieste at the Lanterna Gallery, in Florence at the Flori Gallery, and finally in Rome at the Toninelli Gallery. However, the exhibitions were not successful. =The autostoricizzazione= In 1971 Cavellini coined the term autostoricizzazione (self-historicization), upon which he acted to create a deliberate popular history through self-promotion. He made 16 Manifesti (Posters) for the exhibition that he imagined would take place in 2014 in the most important museums of the world to celebrate the centennial of his birth. In the same year he met Rina Majoli, director of the Cenobio-Visualit√† Gallery, who decided to exhibit the Posters. With the help of fellow artist Sarenco, Cavellini was able to repeat the exhibition at the Aktionsgalerie in Bern and then at the art fair in Basel, where he added some Carbons to the Posters. At the inauguration in Basel on 23 June 1972 there were no visitors. In this period Cavellini also created the first Francobolli (Stamps) that showed his portraits: first that by Mario Ceroli, then those by Mimmo Rotella, James Collins and Andy Warhol. He also made seven self-portraits which he transformed into stamps to celebrate his centennial, and he also exhibited them at the Segnapassi Gallery in Pesaro. He also created 25 covers for the books that the most important people of the past and present time would have written about him: *Saint Augustine, The Confessions of Cavellini *Dante Alighieri, The Divine Cavellini *Giulio Carlo Argan, History of the Art of Cavellini *Charles Baudelaire, Les fleurs du Cavellini *Marcus Tullius Cicero, Orations for Cavellini *Charles Darwin, The Evolution of Cavellini *John the Evangelist, The Apocalypse of Cavellini *Sigmund Freud, Psychopathology of the Life of Cavellini *Galileo Galilei, Discourses on Cavellini *Leonardo da Vinci, Treatise About the Painting of Cavellini *Nikolai Lobachevsky, New Principles of Cavellini *Immanuel Kant, Critique of Cavellinian Reason *Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Prince Cavellini *Mao Zedong, Pensieri di Cavellini *Karl Marx, Il capitale di Cavellini *Henry Miller, Tropic of Cavellini *Moli√®re, Imaginary Cavellini *Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Cavellini *Omero, Odyssey of Cavellini *Ovid, Metamorphosis of Cavellini *Saint Paul, Letters to Cavellini *Jean Paul Sartre, The Nausea of Cavellini *William Shakespeare, Achille *Giorgio Vasari, Life and Works of Cavellini The 25 Books were exhibited in Milan at the Cenobio-Visualit√† Gallery at the beginning of 1973. Then Cavellini wrote an encyclopedia article dedicated to himself, telling his story until the year 2014. He translated the article into four languages and started writing it everywhere: on canvas, sheets, clothes, umbrellas, cardboard and so on. He also wrote it on a white linen suit, which he often wore. He also created 24 Letters written to him by Vincent Van Gogh. In 1973 his works were exhibited at the Bertesca Gallery in Genoa, and then at Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara. At this exhibition he met photographer Michelangelo Giuliani, who took pictures of him with the suit, the hat, the tie and the umbrella showing his story. =The Exhibitions at Home= At the end of 1973 Cavellini began making works of mail art with the 25 Letters, a letter of thanks to each one of the authors who had written books about him, with translations in English, French and Spanish. He printed a catalog of the letters and mailed it to museum and gallery directors, art critics and the most famous artists. That was the first Mostra a domicilio (Exhibition at Home). In January 1974 he exhibited the 25 Books at the Cenobio-Visualit√† Gallery in Milan. Then he created the 25 Visits by famous historical figures, in which he was photographed wearing the suit with his story and a wooden helmet showing the name of the person. He also made new self-portraits, both drawn and photographic. One of them was composed of 330 pictures of his face, each showing a different expression. One of the famous \\"self-historicizing\\" works by Cavellini, for an imaginary exhibition at Doge's Palace in Venice for the centennial of his birth Emilio Villa visited Cavellini in 1974 and convinced the Visual Arts Center of Naples to exhibit the 25 Letters, the exhibition was inaugurated on 10 October. Cavellini made a photomontage showing his exhibition at the Royal Palace of the city, and he used it as a postcard. The same he did with the Duomo di Milano, the Doge's Palace in Venice and the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara. He also printed circular stickers with the colors of the flag of Italy, promoting his imaginary exhibition in Venice. Since then he included the stickers in every work of mail art. At the end of 1974 Cavellini made a new \\"Exhibition at Home\\" titled Cimeli (Relics), which contained documents and photographs from his life. Through Corrado Cagli he met art critic Mario Verdone, who warned him that many Italian artists were criticizing his supposed arrogance. The Relics were praised by George Brecht, Ben Vautier and Marinus Boezem, and Genesis P-Orridge re-elaborated them to create a new work of art. In the same year Cavellini made a new postcard with his decalogue: # Do not self-historicize. # Do not make Posters and Stamps to celebrate your centennial. # Do not make Exhibitions at Home. # Do not burn, do not destroy, do not empty your failed works; do not propose them again; do not dissect those by famous artists. # Do not publish your book of Relics while alive. # Do not write letters of thanks to the great of all time who wrote a book about you. # Do not write letters to the famous artists of the past. # Do not make lists that include your movement among those that contributed to the renewal of modern art. # Do not expose banner of your celebrative exhibitions over the entrance of museums. # Do not publish your past, present and future story; do not write it everywhere (on personal clothes, the human body, fabrics, columns, etcetera). =Encounters/Clashes in the Jungle of Art= In 1975 Cavellini made a new Exhibition at Home with the Analogies: photographs of Vincent Van Gogh and Marcel Duchamp, the encyclopedia entry about Michelangelo, the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci and then Robert Rauschenberg, Jackson Pollock, Vassily Kandinsky, Jean Dubuffet, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Mao Zedong, Richard Nixon, Andy Warhol, each one of them compared to equivalents about Cavellini. The young Marina Abramoviƒá shows interest in Cavellini's work, and Dutch journalist Ger Van Dyck published an interview of Cavellini together with those of Joseph Beuys, Jacobo Borges and Andy Warhol. The interview was made on 22 May 1975 and it was shown at the international videotape congress organized by the CAYC of Buenos Aires at Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara by Argentine architect Jorge Glusberg. In the same year Cavellini published the book Encounters/Clashes in the Jungle of Art. He became interested in conceptual art (Allan Kaprow, Daniel Buren, Dennis Oppenheim, Joseph Kosuth, Dan Graham, Peter Hutchinson, Bill Beckley, Jean Le Gac), and in Milan he bought La d√©construction de l'art by Ben Vautier, a work composed of 167 different paintings. The work represented France at Europalia, an exhibition organized by the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium. Cavellini also visited Vautier in Nice, then went to Paris where he met Daniel Templon and Catherine Millet. In 1975 Cavellini made a new self-portrait, a photomontage of himself on the throne of the Persian Shah, which he also used for a stamp. In September 1975 he exhibited his works twice in Brescia, first at the Banco Gallery and then at the Nuovi Strumenti Gallery managed by his son Piero. He was also invited at the Art Festival in Middelburg, Netherlands, and there he exhibited the 24 Letters written to him by Vincent Van Gogh. He went to Middelburg with photographer Ken Damy, then the exhibition moved to Bruxelles and finally to Antwerp. In October 1975 he exhibited in Poland at the Wsp√≥≈Çczesna Gallery of Warsaw and then at the Sztuki Wsp√≥≈Çczesnej Gallery in Krak√≥w. At the end of the year he wrote his story on a rag of cloth in eight languages. Ken Damy made a videotape in which his students got enveloped in the rag and took it around the streets of Brescia. Cavellini also wrote his story on the body of Marco Lucchetti, documenting his performance through photos and videos. Meanwhile, he also made another Exhibition at Home, writing 25 Letters to masters of painting including Cimabue, Piet Mondrian, Paul C√©zanne, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. The December 1975 edition of the Rizzoli-Larousse encyclopedia included an entry about Cavellini. In 1976 Cavellini made a new Exhibition at Home, publishing his diary of the previous year. At the beginning of 1976 art critic Hans Mayer set up an exhibition about the artist in D√ºsseldorf, which was then replicated in Paris, Brussels and Basel. Luciano Inga Pin, director of the Diagramma Gallery of Milan, brought the Mayer exhibition into his gallery, and in this occasion Cavellini again wrote his story on the body of Marco Lucchetti, in front of critics Gillo Dorfles and Filiberto Menna. The Panorama magazine published a picture of Cavellini during the performance, then Paolo Mosca, director of the Italian edition of Playboy, decided to publish an interview of the artist and on that day Cavellini writes the story on the body of a Playboy model. He then mailed 200 copies of the magazine as a work of mail art. On 9 April 1976 he traveled to Belgrade, Serbia to participate in the inauguration of an exhibition at the Students' Cultural Center. In the same year he was also visited by Eugen DrƒÉgu≈£escu who was working for the Treccani encyclopedia. In 1976 Cavellini managed to obtain a letter of invitation to the Venice Biennale and wrote his name in place of that of the artist, then mailed a letter to the president of the Biennale Commission Carlo Ripa di Meana declining the invitation because he disagreed with the way the event had been organized. The two letters were published on the April 1976 issue of Flash Art. The art book by Albert Skira published a picture of Marco Lucchetti wearing clothes with Cavellini's story written on them. Dutch magazine Miroir and German magazine Pardon published articles about him. Three new solo exhibitions were made in Poland, and one in the Netherlands, and Cavellini was also selected for numerous group exhibitions. He started to gain more popularity. He received a letter from Elke Koska and Ha Schult, German artists. Camillo Capolongo invited him to participate in an exhibition in Naples, Nola and Pomigliano, which was then replicated in Milan at the Castello Sforzesco. Art critic Sara Breitberg, working for the Tel Aviv Art Museum, published an article about Cavellini in an Israeli newspaper, and Orna Panfil from the University of Tel Aviv founded a Center for Cavellinian Research. Italian artist Luciano Bartolini mailed Cavellini a map of Florence showing the road from his home to the Belvedere, during which he had read the 25 Letters. Then he sent him a blank book, and Cavellini replied by filling it with his stamps. This gave him the idea for a new series of works called Andata-ritorno ('Round Trip'), which he made with Bill Gaglione from San Francisco and then many other artists. Art magazines like Egozine, Onderlangs, Vile and Hid published articles about Cavellini, and the book Identit√§t, Realit√§t, Fiktion = Identit√©, r√©alit√©, fiction by Marie- Luise Schumacher, included pictures of the Venice Doge's Palace photomontage made by the artist, his Posters, his meeting with Andy Warhol and also his Last Supper. The Parachute Center for Cultural Affairs of Calgary, Alberta, Canada exhibited Cavellini's works. The ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Museum in Poland was the first to acquire one of his works. However, Cavellini enjoyed no success in Italy, for instance the critic Achille Bonito Oliva, who visited him with Giuseppe Recchia, did not show any interest in his art, and Filiberto Menna and Alberto Boatto judged him negatively. Disappointed, the artist prepared the stamp Nemo propheta in patria. In 1976 Cavellini wrote to Willi Bongard, director of the Art Aktuell magazine, asking to be inserted at the head of a list of the best artists in the world, explaining that his latest Exhibitions at Home had been shown in 10,600 locations, including the most important museums in the world that tacitly accepted the catalogs. Not receiving any reply, he decided to publish the list himself. In February 1977 Franco Farina, director of Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara, invited Cavellini to the inauguration of a space dedicated to the production of videotapes, performances and theater. On 15 April Cavellini made a performance there. Then he participated in the art fairs of Bologna and Basel, and also in documenta in Kassel. Here he met Eberto Carboni, Judith Hoffberg, Gippo Toninelli and Willi Bongard. American magazines File and Art Rite published articles and photographs of him.

The Canadian magazine Virus, the American Tabloid Art and Egozine, and also the German Haute Kunst published articles about him. Canadian artist Vincent Trasov visited Cavellini's home and shot a 19-minute video in which Cavellini made art performances with Colosio and Luchetti. The video was shown on Canadian television on 1 March 1978 and in the United States in September of the same year. On 15 October 1977 art critic Giuseppe Marchiori wrote a letter to Cavellini in which he called him \\"the most famous Italian artist in the world\\". However, the artist kept being ignored in Italy, as he was not present in the catalog of the Bologna art fair, he was not invited an important exhibition about Italian art from 1960 to 1977 at the Galleria Civica in Turin, and he was never listed in the Bolaffi Arte magazine. In 1977 Italian journalist Romano Battaglia dedicated a chapter of his book Vivono fra noi (They Live Among Us), in which he presented a series of unusual people, to Cavellini. He also interviewed him on his television program TG L'una, and during the program Cavellini showed Battaglia his works and wrote on the bodies of Colosio and Luchetti. Marco Nozza published on Il Giorno the article \\"Cavellini teases people\\", confusing the two \\"living works\\" with Cavellini's children Mariella and Pietro. The Bolaffi National Catalog of Modern Art no. 14, edited by critics Renato Barilli, Carlo Bertelli, Maurizio Calvesi, Mario De Micheli, Giuseppe Marchiori and Nello Ponente, coordinated by Paolo Levi, made no mention of Cavellini. However, Sandra Orienti praised his book on Il Popolo, Luigi Serravalli wrote about it on Adige and Luciano Spiazzi did the same on Bresciaoggi. In an interview to Fotografia italiana in November 1977, Andy Warhol called Cavellini \\"my favorite Italian artist\\". In 1977 Italian journalist Toti Carpentieri wrote about Cavellini in a newspaper published in Lecce, then interviewed him for the national television network RAI, asking him for a forecast on the following year's developments in art. Cavellini replied that art was dead and it was useless to make art in the traditional way, that Italy was a provincial nation and Italians were worthless pretentious people. The Gazzetta del luned√¨ newspaper published an article titled \\"The Extraordinary Cavellini\\". On 7 March 1978 the newspaper Il Lavoro published an article by art critic Germano Beringheli titled \\"Cavellini's Schizophrenia\\".

Thus began the period (briefly interrupted from 1803 to 1806) of British control of the Cape, and subsequently much of Southern Africa. The historical remnant of the Battle of Muizenberg is a site on the hillside overlooking False Bay that holds the remains of a defensive fort started by the Dutch in 1795 and expanded by the British from 1796 onwards. Cannons from that era are mounted at \\"Het Posthuys\\", the Muizenberg Park and on the station platform. The railway from Cape Town, which for twenty years stopped at Wynberg, was extended to Muizenberg in 1882. Muizenberg started as a place for holiday homes for the rich after the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand in 1886. Muizenberg Municipality was established in 1895. It merged with Kalk Bay in 1897. In 1910 a library opened next to the Natale Labia, and a year later a post office opened. In 1911 the first pavilion, a wooden one, was built. Buildings The famous architect, Sir Herbert Baker, designed his house \\"Sand Hills\\" on Atlantic Road, was the architect for \\"Vergenoegd\\" further along the same road, and designed \\"Coel an Mar\\" on Main Rd. Many of the buildings in Muizenberg date from the resort town's heyday and are built in the art deco style. At its peak the Muizenberg beachfront attracted masses of holiday-makers and the beach in front of the pavilion earned the name \\"The Snake Pit\\". It boasted a large Jewish population that attended the synagogue in Camp Rd. The community is celebrated in a book called \\"The Stetl by the Sea\\". =Rhodes Cottage= Rhodes' Cottage is a small house on the seafront that Cecil Rhodes bought as a holiday cottage and this was where he died in 1902. The house is preserved as a museum dedicated to Rhodes' life and is open to the public. =Het Posthuys= Het Posthuys is one of the oldest buildings in South Africa,ArteFacts originally erected in February 1673: a year before the Castle in Cape Town was occupied. It was built by the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC), originally as a three- roomed signal station, and used as a military observation post, and subsequently used as a toll-house to levy a tax on farmers passing by to sell their produce to ships lying in Simon's Bay. One of the early postholders was Sergeant Muys (meaning \\"mouse\\"), from whom Muizenberg (formerly Muysenbergh and Muys Zijn Bergh (Muys' mountain) before that) gets its name. After a varied career as a police station, stables, brothel, hotel and private house the building was identified for what it was in the 1980s and restored with funds from Anglo American Corporation. The house is cared for by the Muizenberg Historical Conservation Society and contains a small collection of photos and items of interest relating to early days in Muizenberg. It is open to the public. =Casa Labia= The Muizenberg Battle site flanks the home of the first Italian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to South Africa, Prince Natale Labia. Originally called \\"The Fort\\" after the site of the battle, it now bears the name Casa Labia and is a restaurant, conference centre and music venue. The house was built by skilled Italian artisans and houses part of the Labia family's extensive art collection. Behind Casa Labia lies the grave site of Abe Bailey, one of South Africa's early and important mine magnates. The graveyard is maintained by the Muizenberg Historical Conservation Society. One of the few houses on the sea side of the railway line, is the thatched cottage owned by Bailey and called Bailey's Cottage. This is owned by the South African Navy. =Pavilion= There have been three pavilions built in Muizenberg - the first was a wooden one built in 1911. The next had bathing cubicles, a tearoom, and a 900-seat theatre, built in 1929. This was demolished in 1970, and a third one, still standing, was built. Present day View towards Muizenberg from Rondevlei in Grassy Park. The white tower in the center is the Cinnabar Building. The mountains to the right are part of the Table Mountain National Park featuring Muizenberg Peak, with 507m the highest point above Muizenberg. Muizenberg has a fine, long beach that in effect stretches all the way round the top of False Bay to the Strand, a distance of over 20 km. False Bay, known for its population of White Sharks, also has a shark watch service that operates from Muizenberg, signalling alerts when sharks come in proximity of bathers at the main beach and surfers at Surfer's Corner. Above Muizenberg there is a line of steep cliffs that is very popular as a venue for rock climbing. However, certain parts of the cliff are off-limits to climbers when birds nest on the ledges. The Zandvlei estuary enters the ocean in Muizenberg. The estuary is one of the most important estuaries for fish spawning on the coastline and is home to the Imperial Yacht Club and Peninsula Canoe Club. =Educational establishments= Muizenberg houses one of the False Bay College campuses in the Cinnabar Building, a high- rise apartment tower. The college, a Public Further Education and Training Institution (FET), was established in September 2002 when the South Peninsula College (established 1970) and the Westlake College (established 1954) were merged.Falsebay College Muizenberg is also home to the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), a pan-African centre for education and research in mathematical sciences. Agatha Christie, famous author and playwright, wrote that after nursing duty she would daily take the train to Muizenberg to go surfing.

The line's western terminus is a junction with the CSX (former Louisville and Nashville Railroad) main line in Birmingham, Alabama, near CSX's Boyles Yard. The eastern terminus is Guntersville, Alabama, near the Tennessee River. The parent company of the ATN is OmniTRAX, a major operator of American and Canadian short lines. The route is a combination of the remnants of three former lines: the Seaboard Air Line's (SAL) Atlanta-Birmingham main line from Birmingham to Wellington, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;) former Mineral Belt line from Birmingham to Gadsden, and the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&StL;) line (ex-Tennessee and Coosa Railroad) from Guntersville to Gadsden, which once went further north to Huntsville using a car ferry over the Tennessee River. All of these lines eventually fell under the ownership of CSX. CSX abandoned the L&N; line south of Wellington, where it crossed over the SAL main line, to Anniston, Alabama. Later, the SAL main line was abandoned from Wellington to Cedartown, Georgia. The portion of the former L&N; line from just west of Ivalee, Alabama (near the junction with the NC&StL; line) through Oneonta to Birmingham was sold to a quarry owner along the line who intended to operate it as an independent shortline. Almost all of the line was later abandoned, leaving an L-shaped line from Birmingham to Guntersville. CSX operated this as the Alabama Mineral Subdivision. In 2004, CSX leased the line to OmniTRAX, which gave the line its current name. According to OmniTRAX, there are more than three dozen online customers. The line includes a short branch to Ivalee, Alabama which serves a Tyson Foods feed plant; this branch is a stub of the former L&N; line to Birmingham. The ATN interchanges with CSX Transportation at Boyles Yard, and with Norfolk Southern (former Southern Railway) at Alabama City. The ATN also serves the Port of Guntersville.

The temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, the demon Ravana, king of Lanka, was injured and worshipped Shiva where the temple is currently located. Ravana offered his ten heads one after the other as a sacrifice to Lord Shiva. Pleased with this act, Shiva proceeded to descend to the Earth to cure Ravana.

Devotees collect water from the river in their kanwars and walk 109 km up to Baba Baidyanath temple at Babadham, reciting Bol Bam on the way. On reaching Babadham, the kanwarias first take a dip in the Shivaganga to purify themselves and then enter the Baba Baidyanath temple, where the Ganges water is offered to the Jyotirlingam. This pilgrimage continues during the whole of Shravan for 30 days, from July‚ÄìAugust. This is the longest religious fair in the world.

The network is headquartered at the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center in Quezon City, with additional offices and production facilities in 25 major cities including Baguio, Naga, Bacolod, Iloilo, Cebu, and Davao. ABS-CBN is colloquially referred to as the Kapamilya Network; this branding was originally introduced in 1999 and was officially introduced in 2003 during the celebration of its 50th anniversary. ABS-CBN is the largest media company in the country in terms of revenues, assets, and international coverage. ABS-CBN is the first and oldest television broadcaster in Southeast Asia and one of the oldest commercial television broadcasters in Asia. It has also been the leading television network in the Philippines with advertising revenues of 21.2 billion pesos for the fiscal year of 2015. ABS- CBN's first-ever television broadcast was on October 23, 1953, as Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) on DZAQ-TV, just 3 months after the first broadcast of Japan's NHK General TV and Nippon Television. It is also the first television network in Southeast Asia to broadcast in color, the first television network in the Philippines to formally launch a digital terrestrial television service, and the first broadcast television network in the Philippines to formally launch in high-definition. The flagship television station of ABS-CBN is DWWX-TV (ABS-CBN TV-2 Manila). As such, the network is also referred to informally as Channel 2 or Dos (sometimes used in the Filipino language to mean the number two) even if the network is seen in other channel numbers elsewhere in the country. The network operates across the Philippine archipelago through the ABS-CBN Regional division which controls 80 television stations. Its programs are also available outside the Philippines through the global subscription television channel The Filipino Channel (TFC) which is available in over three million paying households worldwide as well as terrestrially in Guam through KEQI-LP. Since 2011, the network has been on test broadcast for digital terrestrial television using the Japanese standard ISDB-T in select areas in the Philippines. It also partnered with KANTAR Media Inc. the ratings provider of ABS-CBN and other media entity. On October 3, 2015, ABS-CBN started to broadcast in high-definition through its affiliate direct-to-home cable and satellite television providers. ABS-CBN was issued a cease-and-desist order by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and Solicitor General Jose Calida on May 5, 2020, after the NTC refused to renew the network's franchise license earlier in February 2020. After meeting controversy and national outcry over the initial NTC refusal, ABS-CBN was initially allowed to operate under a temporary license, with support from both senate and congress. Investigations by various government offices showed that the company had no deficiencies or issues. There are allegations that the NTC refusal over the franchise renewal was based on the network's critical news coverage of President Rodrigo Duterte's administration. The franchise license expired on May 4, 2020, and a day later, ABS-CBN officially signed off in the evening. This was the second time the network went off-air after the declaration of martial law by Former President Ferdinand Marcos on September 23, 1972. On July 10, 2020, the House Committee rejected the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN. As a result, the network is forced to cease the operations of some of its businesses and laid off its workers on August 31, 2020. Kapamilya Channel was then set up as a replacement of its main terrestrial channel which can be seen via cable, satellite and online. On October 10, 2020, A2Z Channel 11 was launched as the network's temporary terrestrial channel space which is a blocktime agreement between ABS-CBN Corporation and ZOE Broadcasting Network. History =Early years= James Lindenberg, the owner of BEC and an American engineer, was the first to apply for a license to the Philippine Congress to establish a television station in 1949. His request was granted on June 14, 1950, under Republic Act No. 511. Because of the strict import controls and the lack of raw materials needed to open a TV station in the Philippines during the mid-20th century, Lindenberg branched to radio broadcasting instead with the sign-on of experimental radio station DZBC. Judge Antonio Quirino, brother of former President Elpidio Quirino, also tried to apply for a license to Congress, but was denied. He later purchased stocks from BEC and subsequently consummated the controlling stock to rename the company from BEC to Alto Broadcasting System (ABS). DZAQ-TV began commercial television operations on October 23, 1953; the first fully licensed commercial television station in the Philippines. The first program to air was a garden party at the Quirino residence in Sitio Alto, San Juan. After the premiere telecast, the station followed a four-hour-a-day schedule, from six to ten in the evening. On June 16, 1955, Republic Act No. 1343 signed by President Ramon Magsaysay granted Manila Chronicle owner Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and former Vice President Fernando Lopez, a radio-TV franchise from the Congress and immediately established Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) on September 24, 1956, which initially focused only on radio broadcasting. On February 24, 1957, Lopez invited Judge Quirino to his house for breakfast and ABS was bought under a contract written on a table napkin. The corporate name was reverted to Bolinao Electronics Corporation immediately after the purchase of ABS. With the establishment of DZXL-TV 9 of CBN on April 19 (or July), 1958, the Lopez brothers controlled both television channels in the archipelago, culminating in the first wave of expansion. In 1961, BEC launched the nation's first regional and provincial television station in Cebu City. In 1966, ABS- CBN was among the most advanced broadcasting facility of its kind in Asia. Full-color broadcasts began in 1971 (8 hours a day) on ABS-CBN 2 with the availability of more color television sets around Manila and neighboring municipalities and cities. =Martial Law era= The ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center in Diliman, Quezon City, the headquarters of ABS-CBN When then- President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, the station was forced, along with its regional stations and other television networks, to shut down, and the company was seized from the Lopez brothers. Its newly built headquarters was renamed as the \\"Broadcast Plaza\\", and it became the home of the three TV stations that were controlled by the Marcos regime. The first TV station that took over the facility was the Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS-9 (later renamed as Radio Philippines Network or RPN-9 in 1975), after its headquarters and studios at Roxas Boulevard (which ironically previously used by ABS-CBN before moving to Broadcast Center and sold to KBS-9) was destroyed by fire on June 6, 1973. KBS-9 was owned by Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto and was the only TV network that was never shut down by the government in the wake of martial law declaration. In 1974, Benedicto-owned Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation or BBC-2, with call sign changed to DWWX-TV, and the state-run Government Television or GTV-4 (later renamed as Maharlika Broadcasting System or MBS-4), with call sign changed to DWGT-TV, soon also took over the Broadcast Plaza. Both TV stations were previously used by ABS-CBN during the pre-Martial Law era. BBC and RPN were relocated to the Broadcast City compound in Old Balara, Quezon City (along with then-sister station Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation or IBC) in 1978. =Reestablishment= As the People Power Revolution (commonly known as EDSA Revolution) broke out in early 1986, and Marcos' grip on power debilitated, the reformists in the military contended the broadcasting network would be a vital asset for victory. Thus, at 10 am on February 24, 1986, they attacked and took the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center that was then the home of MBS-4 and the long hibernation of the station ended in March. After Marcos was deposed, the newly created Presidential Commission on Good Government returned the network and its flagship station Channel 2 to the Lopezes but not Channel 4 in June 1986. On September 14, 1986, ABS-CBN went back on the air with the TV special, \\"We're back!!\\",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NONo_Fvduy0 broadcasting from what used to be their main garage at the revived Broadcast Center in the pre- Martial Law days. In January 1987, the network was forced to share space in the building that was rightfully their own with the government TV station Channel 4 (until January 22, 1992). At the time, money had been scarce while resources were limited; offices were used as dressing rooms and other equipment such as chairs, tables, and phones were in short supply. Nine years after the revival on March 30, 1995, Republic Act No. 7966 signed by President Fidel Ramos granted ABS-CBN its legislative franchise for the second time. =2000s and the 2010s= During the historic presidential election of 2010, in response to the first automation of the election in the country, ABS-CBN utilized a technology from Orad Hi Tech Systems Ltd. that utilizes the principles of augmented reality. The technology uses real-time image processing system for live broadcasts of 3D computer-generated imagery against a real set or background. ABS-CBN also utilized what was probably the biggest touch screen display to be used in a Philippine television show. A new set dubbed as the \\"WAR\\" (Wireless Audience Response) room was specifically designed for the said election coverage. The coverage of ABS-CBN became the third top trending topic worldwide on the social networking site Twitter. In 2018, ABS CBN won 30 awards during the 16th Gawad Tanglaw awards and also won 34 awards during the 32nd Star Awards for Television for their good TV programs and personalities. Also in December of the same year, ABS-CBN inaugurated its new state-of-the-art sound stages studio complex called Horizon IT Park located at San Jose del Monte, Bulacan which was on par with Hollywood standards. The Phase 1 of the project includes its first two sound stages each sized of 1,500 square meters, with the first stage was named for its chairman emeritus, Eugenio Lopez III who visioned of the new studios, The EL3 Stage. The complex also includes backlots, facilities for its production and post-production, and offices. The studios will be used for its upcoming teleserye The Faithful Wife and its reality singing competition show, Idol Philippines, using the name as \\"Idol City\\". =2020: COVID-19 pandemic, franchise renewal issue and shutdown= On March 10, 2020, in the wake of the World Health Organization-declared COVID-19 pandemic that had also spread across the Philippines, as well as President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration of state of public health emergency after the first local transmission of the coronavirus was confirmed, ABS-CBN announced that it would temporarily suspend its admission of studio audience in tapings for its game, talk, variety and reality shows, including Magandang Buhay, It's Showtime, ASAP Natin 'To, Banana Sundae and the second season of the Philippine version of South Korean game show I Can See Your Voice, to provide safety and well-being to its artists, crew and production teams. The aforementioned shows would, however, continue to air in production without a studio audience. Then, on March 15, 2020, ABS-CBN temporarily suspended production of its entertainment shows, after the entire Luzon was put under a enhanced community quarantine (partial lockdown). Among the prime time shows affected included Pamilya Ko, FPJ's Ang Probinsyano, Make It with You (later canceled without completing its story in June 2020) and A Soldier's Heart, which were all put on hold from March 16 until May 2020. The network aired reruns of some teleseryes and other programs including 100 Days to Heaven, May Bukas Pa, On the Wings of Love, The Legal Wife, Got to Believe, Walang Hanggan, Wildflower, Wansapanataym, iWant Originals Series, Tubig at Langis, Your Face Sounds Familiar Kids Season 1, Pilipinas Got Talent Season 6, Bayani, Hiraya Manawari and Sine'skwela. On May 5, 2020, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order against the network, forcing it to suspend operations for all of its physical broadcasting channels (with the exception of Cine Mo!, Yey!, Kapamilya Box Office [KBO] through a blocktime agreement with the AMCARA Broadcasting Network in Metro Manila, Laguna, Iloilo and some portions of Baguio and the cable channels run by the Creative Programs subsidiary of the company). This was following the expiration on May 4 of the network's congressional franchise that permitted it to broadcast. The franchise was in the process of renewal, but had however been delayed due to the extension of the enhanced community quarantine to May 15, 2020, 11 days after the scheduled expiration. The network went off-air at exactly 7:52 pm (PST) of May 5. On June 4, 2020, ABS-CBN announced on TV Patrol that the cable-and-satellite channel Kapamilya Channel launched on June 13, serving as the interim replacement of ABS-CBN terrestrial network, and thus resuming the production of ABS-CBN's drama and live entertainment shows and the airing its entertainment, educational and current affairs programming, along with films. Like the ABS-CBN network, the Kapamilya Channel was also live streamed on the iWant streaming service and the programmes aired on that channel are also available on-demand via iWant. On June 30, 2020, the NTC issued an alias cease and desist order to ABS-CBN to stop its digital TV transmission on AMCARA Broadcasting Network's DWBM-TV (channel 43) in Metro Manila (later expanded to Laguna, and some portions of Baguio and Iloilo City on July 1) as well as a cease and desist order to stop Sky Cable Corporation's direct broadcast satellite service Sky Direct. On July 10, 2020, members of the House of Representatives, particularly the Committee on Legislative Franchises, voted 70‚Äì11 to deny the franchise application of ABS-CBN, citing several issues on the network's franchise. Only about 12.94% of the Congress voted for franchise renewal. Its President and CEO, Carlo Katigbak said the company remains committed to the public service, with hoping to find other ways to pursue their mission. A Social Weather Stations survey released following the rejection of the network's franchise renewal, showed that an overwhelming majority (75%) of all Filipinos want the network back. =2020-present: Blocktime with ZOE TV= On October 6, 2020, ABS-CBN Corporation announced that they will air its shows and movies back on Free TV via the new \\"A2Z\\" channel starting October 10, 2020. It is a blocktime agreement between the media conglomerate and ZOE Broadcasting Network. ABS-CBN Regional ABS-CBN Regional (formerly Regional Network Group) serves as the regional network division of ABS-CBN. It is responsible for simultaneously airing most of the shows seen on ABS-CBN's flagship station in the provinces, all stations (Cebu, Bacolod and Davao) were reopened 16 years ago in 1988 after the network's hibernation due to Martial law in September 1972 aside from Manila's flagship station, which reopened after the People Power Revolution in September 1986. ABS-CBN Regional has several stations in each region outside Mega Manila to ensure nationwide coverage. The local stations also produce their own newscasts which air prior to TV Patrol and other local programming which air on Sundays. The launch of the local game show Kapamilya Winner Ka! (now renamed as Kapamilya, Mas Winner Ka!) in the Visayas and Mindanao, Bagong Morning Kapamilya in North Luzon (Baguio and Dagupan), the 17th local TV Patrol in Southern Tagalog (Region IV-A), and the 18th local TV Patrol in Palawan (IV-B; the network had an affiliate station), provided more relevance to regional audiences. On April 15, 2011, RNG launched ChoosePhilippines, a new website aimed to promote tourism in the Philippines by sharing photos and stories of the most extravagant places, culture, and arts of the Philippine island. Programming The majority of the programs shown on the network are created by ABS-CBN Corporation's Entertainment division. ABS-CBN Entertainment Group was responsible for original programs ranging from musical and variety shows, showbiz, lifestyle, comedy talk shows, comedy, gag shows, and sitcoms. Original and adapted telenovelas and drama anthologies are produced by Dreamscape, Star Creatives and other production drama units created by ABS- CBN, while news, public service, and documentary programs are produced by ABS- CBN News and by other independent production outfits.

Digital transition =Digital terrestrial television= Office of the Ombudsman building ABS-CBN Corporation initially applied for a license from the National Telecommunications Commission to operate a digital terrestrial television service in the country back in 2007. ABS-CBN planned to utilize multiplex to offer ABS-CBN, S+A, and 5 additional specialty TV channels. The conglomerate was expected to spend at least 1 billion pesos annually for the next 5 years for its DTT transition. ABS-CBN utilized UHF channel 51 Manila (695.143 MHz), later UHF Channel 43 (647.143 MHz), for test broadcasts in the DVB-T format. ABS-CBN was expected to begin digital test broadcasts in January 2009. In June 2010, the NTC announced that it would formally adopt the Japanese standard ISDB-T for digital broadcasting and issued a circular commanding all the country's television networks to switch- off their analog services on December 31, 2015, at 11:59 p.m. Philippine Standard Time (UTC+8). But due to delay of the release of the implementing rules and regulations for digital television broadcast, the target date was moved to 2023. In April 2011, the conglomerate announced further details about its DTT plans, which would offer ABS-CBN and Studio 23 (currently S+A). In addition, four new channels which will be exclusively available to its digital users will be offered once the digital broadcast start. The specialty TV channel lineup will include one news channel, one youth-oriented channel, an educational channel, and a movie channel. The conglomerate was also planning to utilize the 1seg (one segment) broadcast standard for handheld devices.Exclusive: The ABS-CBN Digital TV retrieved October 18, 2013 In September 2014, ABS-CBN soft-launched its DTT service started selling ISDB-T receivers in selected barangays in Metro Manila under Sky TV+ brand.

Controversies and scandals Throughout the years, ABS-CBN has been involved in several controversies and scandals involving its talents, employees, and programs. =2004 copyright infringement with GMA= On July 22, 2004, during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia), live breaking news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other television stations in the Philippines. GMA Network used audio-video coverage from Reuters, which GMA Network subscribed to. During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of the live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor ABS-CBN. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of Republic Act 8293 (or the Intellectual Property Code) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to ABS- CBN Corporation. The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter. =Wowowee scandals and incidents= Two major incidents involving ABS-CBN have involved the network's variety show Wowowee. The first incident was a demand for tickets to a one-year anniversary episode of the show at the PhilSports Arena in 2006 caused a deadly stampede killing 76 people. Over a year later in August 2007, the show became entrenched in another scandal involving the possibility of a new game on the show being rigged as evident by a \\"mechanical glitch\\" which occurred during an episode, which grew greater after Eat Bulaga! host Joey de Leon and Wowowee host Willie Revillame started exchanging attacks on-air against each other during their respective and competing shows. The incident later led to a probe by the Department of Trade and Industry led by senator Mar Roxas (which was jokingly suggested by Joey during a speech he made on Eat Bulaga! in reference to the Hello Garci scandal, dubbing it \\"Hello Pappy\\"). =AGB Nielsen TV ratings scandal= In late 2007, ABS-CBN and GMA Network accused AGB Nielsen Philippines of tampering with the ratings during their 2007 ratings surveys. On January 8, 2008, Quezon City regional trial court (RTC) junked ABS-CBN's case against AGB Nielsen, saying it was prematurely filed. =Writ of Amparo= On January 22, 2008, Asia-Pacific Director Jacqueline Park of the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) supported the petition for writ of amparo filed by the ABS- CBN Broadcasting Corporation's 11 employees (led by Ces Ore√±a-Drilon) with the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of journalists' arrests concerning the failed Manila Peninsula rebellion. It stated: \\"We support employees from ABS- CBN in standing up for their democratic rights to work free from harassment and intimidation, especially from government officials and authorities.\\" Meanwhile, the Supreme Court required the respondents to file comment to the amparo petition within 10 days. Further, Harry Roque, National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP)'s lawyer announced its filing of a class lawsuit for injunction with damages (Article 33, New Civil Code of the Philippines) against the Philippine National Police, among others. =ABS-CBN vs. Willing Willie copyright case= ABS-CBN demanded 127 million pesos from their former reality show star, Willie Revillame, citing copyright infringement due to stark similarities in Revillame's show, Willing Willie on TV5, and ABS-CBN's Wowowee.\\"ABS-CBN files P127-M copyright case vs. 'Willing Willie'\\", \\"ABS-CBN\\", November 25, 2010 ABS-CBN listed 5 acts of plagiarism allegedly committed by Willing Willie in their complaint as follows: #Willing Willies opening song and dance number was similar to that of Wowowee's #\\"BIGA- Ten\\" and \\"Big Time Ka,\\" both segments from the shows involved, bear similar names. #\\"Willie of Fortune\\" and \\"Willtime Bigtime\\" are segments from both shows which resemble each other. ABS-CBN claimed that Willtime Bigtime resembled its show as it also showcases contestants relaying their personal stories before proceeding to play a singing/trivia game. #April \\"Congratulations\\" Gustilo was one of several backup dancers from Wowowee who also appear in Willing Willie. #Other striking similarities ABS-CBN claimed are found in Willing Willies set design, stage, studio viewers' seats lay-out, lighting angles and camera angles. A 25-page ruling later on dated May 22, 2015 junked the case against Revillame, declaring it moot. After the Quezon City RTC demanded a 400 million peso bond from Revillame to answer any further damage the network might sustain, it was later discharged. Revillame signed a contract with GMA network two days prior to the ruling, to work on a new show entitled, Wowowin. =2020 franchise renewal controversy= Since April 2017, ABS-CBN came under fire by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte due to the network refusing to air his 2016 presidential campaign ads in favor of a smear ad paid for by-then vice presidential candidate Antonio Trillanes. However, according to the country's Commission on Elections spokesperson James Jimenez, the controversial ad was well within Election Law, under \\"Partisan Political Activity\\" Duterte publicly stated that he will oppose the 25-year franchise renewal of ABS-CBN; former Laguna governor E.R. Ejercito wholeheartedly supported Duterte's plan. Opposition lawmakers as well as labor groups objected to Duterte's stand on ABS-CBN as the franchise non-renewal will compromise the employees of the network; stating that the blocking of the franchise renewal had no merit. Opposition groups also claimed that the non- renewal of the franchise violates press freedom. Under Philippine law, broadcasting networks requires a congressional franchise (Republic Act) to operate television and radio stations for 25 years; absence of one will lead to suspension of such operations. ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, which was approved by the virtue of Republic Act No. 7966 (granted last March 30, 1995), was set to expire on May 4, 2020 because the franchise will become effective fifteen (15) days after its publication on Official Gazette on April 19, 1995.\\"ABS-CBN franchise to expire on May 4, 2020 ‚Äì DOJ\\" CNNPhilippines.com February 24, 2020. At least 12 lawmakers has filed their own versions for a new franchise of the network.

December 4, 2019. Retrieved on December 15, 2019. On February 24, 2020, the CEO of the network apologized to President Rodrigo Duterte for not airing his political advertisements during his 2016 polls, which Duterte accepted, and the Congress finally made its decision to tackle their franchise renewal. During a Senate Hearing on the same day, public services panel chair Grace Poe stated they were to tackle ABS-CBN's compliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise. The conclusion was that there was no breach of laws or franchise terms. On May 5, 2020, the National Telecommunications Commission issued a cease and desist order to stop the network's broadcast, including its radio stations DZMM and MOR, following the expiration of its broadcast franchise the day before. The cease and desist order covers 42 television stations operated by ABS-CBN across the country, including Channel 2, 10 digital broadcast channels, 18 FM stations, and 5 AM stations. The network subsequently signed off following the airing of news program TV Patrol. Along with the order, NTC wanted to recall ABS-CBN's assigned frequencies. ABS-CBN explained that it would not be in public interest to have the frequencies recalled, as this would hinder their ability to immediately restart broadcasts in the event a new franchise was granted. Additionally, there were fresh measures in the Congress to grant provisional franchise, which later rolled into a series of hearings to grant a fresh 25-year franchise. NTC was told to refrain from carrying out the recall by the Congress. On July 10, 2020, members of the House of Representatives, voted 70‚Äì11 to deny the franchise application of ABS-CBN, citing several issues on the network's franchise. A Social Weather Stations survey, released following the rejection of the network's franchise renewal, showed that majority (75%) of Filipinos want the network back.

It is thought to have been instrumental in setting in motion forces that eventually caused Finnish independence.  Origins  Valhallaorden began as an offshoot of an obscure Swedish quasi-masonic secret society called La Constance, created to bolster loyalty to the Swedish Constitution of 1772. However, the Swedish counterpart withered quickly, while the Valhalla society took root in the Suomenlinna () fortress. In addition to the originating lodge in Sweden, they had a lodge known as The Cabin of the Holy Axel based in Turku.  Historical context  Walhalla-orden was not unique to its period in Sveaborg; quite the contrary, besides a masonic lodge and Walhalla-orden, there were a number of similar societies including a British-inspired secret society of kirvesmiehet called Saint Charles' Cabin and another unconnected society called Brothers of February the Seventeenth. On the frivolous side, there was also a secret society called the Hypotenuse Society, which was primarily oriented around marathon drinking. Every shot of punch was registered as a working in the meeting minutes.  Name  The Walhalla-orden originally was preceded by a lodge taking the name of an early ancestor of J√§gerhorn, namely Rutger Ingesson, who according to legends inspired by the Song of Roland was a crusader knight in the troops of Erik the Holy. In fact there was a brief time during which St. Erik's lodge was the Finnish locus of activities.  Symbology  The Walhalla-orden drew its symbology from Gothic revivalist notions of ancient Scandinavian roots, and the lodges for instance were called by a more archaic Scandinavian name. Even though the initiation ceremonies centered on a five-part play expressing the history of the creation of the Swedish nation in allegorical fashion, the symbolic organizational structure was entirely Finnish without reference to Swedish counties or emblems.  Development  The society began on a strict loyalist foundation and stayed nominally in support of the constitution, but after a short time its membership became primarily composed of officers stationed there who had a grievance with Gustav III. The members were bound by oath to keep their conversations frank and confidential, and took that obligation seriously. Therefore, it is almost certain that many seditious matters were broached, in one form or another. This assumption is supported by the fact that nearly all of the people implicated in the Anjala conspiracy, including its leadership, were members of it.  Activities  Though only few fragments of encrypted correspondence remain, and the archives were burned to protect the members later implicated in what the crown considered to be nefarious plots, such as the Anjala conspiracy, it is thought that the meetings of the Walhalla-orden may have been the first discussions in which Finnish independence was proposed as a serious idea. Indeed, in the society, people floated the idea of Finland becoming a protectorate of Russia.

Dhanbad Municipality is the chief town and the headquarters of the district. In the year 1991, Bokaro District was constituted by carving out Chas Sub-division of Dhanbad district and Bermo Subdivision of Giridih District. The early history of the greater part of the Chotanagpur Plateau is shrouded in mystery and that of Dhanbad district is particularly so. Details of even later periods are difficult to trace as the present district formed but a small and insignificant part of Manbhum. In the Settlement Report for Manbhum (1928) it has been stated that no rock inscriptions, copper plates or old coins were discovered and not a single document of copper plate or palm leaf was found in course of the Survey and Settlement operations. The oldest authentic documents produced were all on paper and barely even a hundred years old. In view of these circumstances the District Gazetteer for Dhanbad (1964) merely reproduces the chapter on history in the Settlement Report of 1928 which pertains to the entire district of Manbhum. It was a small village of the erstwhile district of Manbhum which had its headquarters in Purulia (now in West Bengal). Manbhum in turn, derived its name from Raja Man Singh, who was gifted this territory by Emperor Akbar, following his victory in a certain battle. The district being extremely vast and far-flung soon got divided into Birbhum, Manbhum and Singhbhum, for administrative purposes. However, on 24 October 1956 Dhanbad was declared a District on the Recommendation of the State Reconstitution Commission vide notification 1911. Its geographical length, extending from north to south, was 43 miles and breadth 47 miles, stretching across east to west. In 1991 a part of Dhanbad was sliced away from Bokaro district, diminishing thereby its total area to 2995 km2. Earlier, the district was split into two sub ‚Äì divisions ‚Äì Dhanbad Sadar and Baghmara. The former incorporated 6 blocks, while the latter had four and together they enclosed 30 Nagar Palikas, 228 Panchayats and 1654 villages. The then vastness of the district called for two police headquarters, based at Bokaro and Dhanbad respectively. Meanwhile, the district as its stands today, has only one sub-division called the Dhanbad Sadar. There are presently, 8 blocks here viz. Jharia, Baghmara, Dhanbad, Nirsa, Govindpur, Baliapur, Tundi, and Topchanchi. The blocks in turn have 181 panchayats and 1348 villages. As per the 1991 Census, the total population of the districts stands at 19,49,526 of which the number of males have been recorded as 10,71,913 along with 8,77,613 females. There are of hillocks and of forests. It is about 500‚Äì1000 feet above Sea level. Its soil is, by and large lateritic in nature. The district is currently a part of the Red Corridor. Geography The district is bounded on the west by Giridih and Bokaro on the north by Giridih and Dumka and on the east and south by Purulia district of West Bengal. It is situated in the state of Jharkhand and lies between 23¬∞37'3\\" N and 24¬∞4' N latitude and between 86¬∞6'30\\" E and 86¬∞50' E longitude. =Natural divisions= The district can be divided into three broad natural divisions, namely, (I) the north and north western portions consisting of the hilly region, (ii) the uplands containing coal mines and most of the industries and (iii) the remaining uplands and plains lying to the south of the Damodar river consisting of cultivable flat lands. The north and north western division is separated for the entire length by the Grand trunk road. In the western middle part of the district are the Dhangi hills, situated in the strip falling between the Grand trunk road in the north and the Grand chord line of the Eastern Railway. In the south, these hills extend from Pradhankhanta to Govindpur, reaching a maximum altitude of 1,256 feet at Dhangi. Further north, a branch of the Parasnath hill runs through Topchanchi and Tundi, the highest point of 1,500 feet being reached at Lalki. The southern part of the district is largely undulating land. The general slope is from west to east, the direction followed by the two major rivers, Damodar and Barakar. =Rivers= The Damodar is the most important river of the Chotanagpur plateau. It rises in Palamu and flows eastward between the plateaus of Ranchi and Hazaribag. It is joined by the Bokaro, the Konar and the Barakar rivers. The Damodar enters Dhanbad district at its confluence with the Jamuria, a stream which marks the western boundary of Dhanbad with Hazaribagh District. Further east, the Damodar is joined by the Katri River which rises in the foot hills below Parasnath and traverses through the Coal- field Area. The Damodar flows for about 77 km through the district being joined by the Barakar at its eastern border near Chirkunda. The Panchet dam extending to roughly 6 km is built on river Damodar. The hydel station there generates 40,000 kW. Sunset at Maithon Dam The Barakar, which forms the northern boundary of the district, traverses about 77 km in the district. It flows in south westerly direction up to Durgapur and then south till it joins the Damodar near Chirkuda. The Maithon dam is located on this river about 13 km off its confluence with the Damodar. Attached to it is the Maithan Power Station with a generating capacity of 60,000 kW. Among other small rivers in the district are Gobai, the Irji, the Khudia besides the river Katri. =Climatic conditions= The climate of the district is characterised by general dryness. It is very pleasant during the cold weather from November to February. Thereafter the climate becomes warm. It remains hot until the monsoon breaks towards the middle of June. With the setting in of rains, the temperature falls and humidity rises; July to October are the rainy months. July and August are the wettest months. The average rainfall during July is 287 mm and that in August 445 mm. The average annual rainfall in the district is approximately 1300 mm. Economy In 2006 the Indian Government named Dhanbad one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 21 districts in Jharkhand currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). Demographics According to the 2011 census Dhanbad district has a population of 2,684,487, roughly equal to the nation of Kuwait or the US state of Nevada. This gives it a ranking of 148th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001‚Äì2011 was 11.91%. Dhanbad has a sex ratio of 908 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 75.71%. At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 26.8% of the population in the district spoke Hindi, 25.2% Khortha, 17.95% Bengali, 8.70% Santali, 8.47% Urdu, 5.19% Magahi and 4.46% Bhojpuri as their first language.2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue See also *Manaitand References External links * Official district government website * Dhanbad Portal Category:Districts of Jharkhand Category:Coal mining districts in India Category:1956 establishments in India ","title":"Dhanbad district"},{"id":"2503423","text":"Striga, commonly known as witchweed, is a genus of parasitic plants that occur naturally in parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is in the family Orobanchaceae. Some species are serious pathogens of cereal crops, with the greatest effects being in savanna agriculture in Africa. It also causes considerable crop losses in other regions, including other tropical and subtropical crops in its native range and in the Americas. Description Witchweeds are characterized by bright-green stems and leaves and small, brightly colored and attractive flowers.Sand, Paul, Robert Eplee, and Randy Westbrooks. Witchweed Research and Control in the United States. Champaign, IL: Weed Science Society of America, 1990. They are obligate hemiparasites of roots and require a living host for germination and initial development, though they can then survive on their own. The genus is classified in the family Orobanchaceae, although older classifications place it in the Scrophulariaceae.For example, Integrated Taxonomic Information System as of 16 Sep 2007 The number of species is uncertain, but may exceed 40 by some counts.Witchweeds - beautiful but deadly, in The Horticulturalist, Vol. 21-4, October 2012 Hosts and symptoms Although most species of Striga are not pathogens that affect human agriculture, some species have devastating effects upon crops, particularly those planted by subsistence farmers. Crops most commonly affected are corn, sorghum, rice and sugarcane. Three species cause the most damage: Striga asiatica, S. gesnerioides, and S. hermonthica. Witchweed parasitizes maize, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, legumes, and a range of weedy grasses.Johnson, Annie. New South Wales. Witchweed. 2005. http://www.wyong.nsw.gov.au/environment/Weeds_category_one_Witchweed.pdf It is capable of significantly reducing yields, in some cases wiping out the entire crop. Host plant symptoms, such as stunting, wilting, and chlorosis, are similar to those seen from severe drought damage, nutrient deficiency, and vascular disease.Agrios, George N. Plant Pathology. 5th ed. London: Elsevier Academic Press, 2005. Lifecycle Photo of plant roots with connected Striga plant Each plant is capable of producing between 90,000 and 500,000 seeds, which may remain viable in the soil for over 10 years.United States. Witchweed: A Parasitic Pest. District of Columbia: USDA, 2011. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/2011/witchweed_parasitic_pest.pdf Most seeds produced are not viable. An annual plant, witchweed overwinters in the seed stage. Its seeds germinate in the presence of host root exudate, and develop haustoria which penetrate host root cells. Host root exudate contain strigolactones, signaling molecules that promote striga seed germination. A bell-like swelling forms where the parasitic roots attach to the roots of the host. The pathogen develops underground, where it may spend the next four to seven weeks before emergence, when it rapidly flowers and produces seeds. Witchweed seeds spread readily via wind and water, and in soil via animal vectors. The chief means of dispersal, however, is through human activity, by means of machinery, tools, and clothing. = Haustorium Development = Once germination is stimulated, the Striga seed sends out an initial root to probe the soil for the host root. The initial root secretes an oxidizing enzyme that digests the host root surface, releasing quinones. If the quinone product is within the appropriate concentrations, a haustorium will develop from the initial root. The haustorium grows toward the host root until it makes contact with the root surface, establishing parasitic contact in relatively short order. Within 12 hours of initial haustorium growth, the haustorium recognizes the host root and begins rapid cell division and elongation. The haustorium forms a wedge shape and uses mechanical force and chemical digestion to penetrate the host root, pushing the host cells out of the way. Within 48‚Äì72 hours, the haustorium has penetrated the host root cortex. Finger-like structures on the haustorium, called oscula (from Latin osculum, \\"little mouth\\") penetrate the host xylem through pits in the membrane. The oscula then swell to secure their position within the xylem membrane. Striga sieve tubes develop along with the oscula. Shortly after the host xylem is penetrated, Striga sieve tubes develop and approach the host phloem within eight cells. This eight cell layer allows for nonspecific nutrient transport from the host to the Striga seedling. Within 24 hours after tapping the host xylem and phloem, the Striga cotyledons emerge from the seed. Environment Temperatures ranging from in a moist environment are ideal for germination. Witchweed will not develop in temperatures below . Agricultural soils with a light texture and low nitrogen levels tend to favor Striga's development.California Department of Food and Agriculture. Witchweed. http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/ipc/weedinfo/striga.htm Still, witchweed has demonstrated a wide tolerance for soil types if soil temperatures are favorably high. Seeds have been shown to survive in frozen soil of temperatures as low as , attesting to their aptitude as overwintering structures. Soil temperature, air temperature, photoperiod, soil type, and soil nutrient and moisture levels do not greatly deter the development of witchweed. These findings,while limited to the Carolinas in the United States, seem to suggest that the pathogen could successfully infect the massive corn crops of the American Midwest. Management Management of witchweed is difficult because the majority of its life cycle takes place below ground. If it is not detected before emergence, it is too late to reduce crop losses. To prevent witchweed from spreading it is necessary to plant uncontaminated seeds and to clean soil and plant debris off of machinery, shoes, clothing, and tools before entering fields. If populations are low, hand weeding before seeds are produced is an option. Striga in the United States has been controlled through the use of several management strategies, including quarantines imposed on affected areas, control of movement of farm equipment between infected and uninfected areas, herbicide application, and imposed \\"suicidal germination\\". For the latter, in fields not yet planted in crops, seeds present in the soil are induced to germinate by injecting Ethylene gas, which mimics the natural physiological response tied to host recognition. Because no host roots are available, the seedlings die. Unfortunately, each Striga plant can produce tens of thousands of tiny seeds, which may remain dormant in the soil for many years. Thus, such treatments do not remove all seeds from the soil. Moreover, this method is expensive and not generally available to farmers in developing nations of Africa and Asia. Another method called trap cropping involves planting a species in an infested field that will induce the Striga seeds to germinate but will not support attachment of the parasite. This method has been used in sorghum plantations by planting Celosia argentea between the sorghum rows. Cotton, sunflower and linseed are also effective trap crops. Planting silverleaf (Desmodium uncinatum) inhibits striga seed germination and has worked effectively intercropped with maize. Increasing nitrogen levels in the soil, growing striga-tolerant varieties, trap-cropping, and planting susceptible crops harvested before witchweed seed is produced, are proven anti-striga tactics. Coating maize seeds with fungi or a herbicide also appears to be a promising approach. An example is TAN222, the \\"striga-resistant\\" maize variety which is coated with the systemic herbicide imazapyr, to which it is resistant. Any striga seeds sprouting when this maize is in the seedling stage are poisoned when their haustoria embed in the seedling's roots.\\"Controlling Witchweed in Sub-saharan Africa.\\" Web. 7 Dec 2010. Several sorghum varieties have high levels of resistance in local conditions, including 'N-13', 'Framida', and 'Serena'.\\"Purple Witchweed.\\" Infonet-biovision. N.p., 14 Sep 2009. Web. 7 Dec 2010. <>. 'Buruma', 'Shibe', 'Okoa' and 'Serere 17' millet cultivars are considered to be resistant in Tanzania. Some maize varieties show partial resistance to witchweed, including 'Katumani' in Kenya. In a number of rice cultivars, including some cultivars of NERICA (New Rice for Africa), effective pre- and post- attachment resistance mechanisms have been identified. 'StrigAway'‚Ñ¢ herbicide-resistant, herbicide impregnated maize has been shown to reduce the seed bank of striga by 30% in two seasons.  Importance  Maize, sorghum, and sugarcane crops affected by witchweed in the United States have an estimated value well over $20 billion. Furthermore, witchweed is capable of wiping out an entire crop. In fact, it is so prolific that in 1957 Congress allocated money in an attempt to eradicate witchweed. Because of Striga, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture established a research station and control methods. Through infestation mapping, quarantine, and control activities such as contaminated seed destruction, the acreage parasitized by witchweed has been reduced 99% since its discovery in the United States. APHIS has even offered cash rewards those who identify and report the weed, and encourages landowners to check their own acreage. Parasitizing important economic plants, witchweed is one of the most destructive pathogens in Africa. In fact, witchweed affects 40% of Africa's arable savanna region, resulting in up to $13 billion lost every year. Striga affects 40 million hectares (98,842,153 acres) of crops in sub-Saharan Africa alone. The witchweed infestation is so bad in parts of Africa, some farmers must relocate every few years.Samarrai, Fariss. \\"U.Va. Scientists Identify Gene for Resistance to Parasitic 'Witchweed'.\\" UVaToday. N.p., 27 Aug 2009.

History The territory covered by the present district was earlier known as Chatra sub-division of Hazaribagh district. This district came into existence in 1991.  Administration  = Blocks/Mandals = Chatra district consists of 12 Blocks. The following are the list of the Blocks in Chatra district: Member of Parliament: Sunil singh Member of Legislative Assembly (Chatra): Jay Prakash Singh Bhokta Member of Legislative Assembly (Simaria): Ganesh Ganjhu =Ancient period= In ancient period, the area covered by the present district and adjoining areas were ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya empire during Ashoka's reign ( BCE). Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chotanagpur region, directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley. =Medieval period= During Muhammad bin Tughluq's reign, the territory which comprises the present district came in contact with the Delhi sultanate. Later, it became a part of the Bihar Subah of the Mughal empire. Daud Khan, the Mughal Subahdar of Bihar, during the reign of Aurangzeb occupied Kothi near Pokhri Fort on 5 May 1660, without much opposition, and then he moved towards the fort of Kunda which had a very strong fortification as it was situated on a hilltop. This fort was finally occupied by him and was completely destroyed on the 2 June 1660. Later, Kunda Fort was under the possession of the Raja of Ramgarh. In 1734, Aliwardi Khan advanced towards Kunda after defeating the rebel Zamindars of Tikari (Gaya). He mounted an attack on Chatra Fort and demolished it. =British rule= The British East India Company came in contact with this region for the first time in 1769. Raja Rammohan Roy, worked as a serestadar at Chatra from 1805‚Äì06 and stayed both at Chatra and Ramgarh while in office. The most important battle fought between the insurgents and the British in Chotanagpur during the rebellion of 1857 was the \\"Battle of Chatra\\". This decisive battle was fought on 2 October 1857, near Phansi Talab. It lasted for an hour in which the mutineers were completely defeated. 56 European soldiers and officers were killed whereas 150 revolutionaries were killed and 77 were buried in a pit. Subedar Mangal Pandey and Nadir Ali Khan were sentenced and hanged to death on the 4 October 1857 on this very spot. The European and Sikh soldiers were buried in a well along with their arms and ammunitions. An inscriptive plaque which is still extant states: > \\"56 men of Her Majesty's 53rd Regiment of foot and a party of Sikhs were > killed at Chatra on October 2nd 1857 in action against mutineers of the > Ramgarh Battalion. Lieutenant J. C. C. Daunt of the 70th Bengal Native > Infantry and sergeant D. Dynon of the 53rd regiment were awarded Victoria > Cross for conspicuous gallantry in the battle, in which the mutineers were > completely defeated and lost all their four guns and ammunitions. At the same time, another inscription on the bank of the Phansi Talab immortalises the two revolutionary subedars, namely, Mangal Pandey and Nadir Ali Khan. Independence movement The independence movement in this district gathered momentum in 1921. One of the most significant events of the Quit India Movement in 1942, was the escape of Jai Prakash Narayan along with six other from The Hazaribagh Central Jail on 9 November 1942 (the night of festival of Diwali). Jai Prakash Narayan came to Tatra (a village in this district )where he was at the home of panchkodi dubey, and then proceeded towards Sherghati en route to Varanasi. The notable participants in the independence movement from this district include Chotanagpur Kesri, Babu Ram Narayan Singh, and Babu Shaligram Singh. =Post-independence= The district is currently a part of the Red Corridor.

Divorced, he hires a woman with a young granddaughter as his housekeeper and devotes himself to his new job. One day, while he is out at work, his housekeeper shows her daughter his house. It is Lola, who decides she wants to know this interesting man and soon attracts his attention under her real name, Marie-Luise. Unaware of her night job or that Schuckert is her daughter's father, von Bohm proposes to her, but she warns him off. When he is finally taken to the brothel, he discovers the truth about her. In the meantime von Bohm has been collecting evidence of Coburg's widespread corruption, including building permits masterminded by Schuckert, and decides to put a stop to it, but nobody is interested.

Loewe's companies became involved in the production of armaments, employing famous designers and creating notable guns. Manufacturing Loewe was born as Louis Levy in Heiligenstadt, Germany into a Jewish family. He set up Ludwig Loewe Commanditgesellschaft auf Aktien f√ºr Fabrikation von N√§hmaschinen A.G. in 1869 to produce sewing machines. In 1872 an agreement was reached with the German army to produce rifles for them. For this he set up a separate armaments company Ludwig Loewe & Company (also known as Loewe & Company). Armaments Loewe's armaments company was famous in that it held a controlling interest in Waffenfabrik Mauser and so was able to reap financial success from the C96 pistol when Loewe's own Borchardt semi-automatic pistol, designed by employee Hugo Borchardt, was not selling well. Ludwig Loewe & Company also employed Georg Luger, the inventor of the Luger pistol (as well as the associated gun cartridges). After Loewe's death After Loewe died in Berlin his younger brother Isidor Loewe took over the running of the company. The name of the main company was eventually changed to Gesellschaft f√ºr Elektrische Unternehmungen Ludwig Loewe & Co. A.G.. This 'Loewe Group' of companies had three main products: electricity, machinery, and armaments. In 1896, Ludwig Loewe & Cie obtained a majority interest in the Karlsruhe-based Deutsche Metallpatronenfabrik. In the same year, it was decided to merge the ammunition production of Deutsche Metallpatronenfabrik with Loewe's firearms branch in Berlin, creating a new company of which Loewe remained the owner: Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM).  Ludwig Loewe and DWM  Ludwig Loewe and his younger brother Isidor founded the world's largest machine tool and weapons empire in the years previous to the outbreak of WWISeherr-Tho√ü, Hans Christoph Graf von, \\"Loewe, Ludwig\\" in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 15 (1987), S. 77-78 [Online-Version]; URL: https://www.deutsche- biographie.de/pnd117166839.html#ndbcontent Loewe's company, DWM owned or was associated with, among others, the Hungarian Weapons and Machine Manufacturing Co.in Budapest, in Belgium, the Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre (FN) in Herstal and Pieper in L√ºttich, and the British Vickers Sons & Maxim Ltd. where the third Loewe brother Sigmund (1854-1904) was Managing Director. Loewe obtained a share majority in Mauser/Oberndorf in 1887 and the metal cartridge manufacturer Maschinenfabrik Lorenz in Karlsruhe was added in 1889. Eventually, DWM encompassed the total German weapons production with the exclusion of Krupp and Thyssen with over 11,000 employees.  Growth of the company and German industrialization  In 1896 Loewes consolidated their weapons manufacturing interests in the newly founded holding company, Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) in Berlin. Their father had been a cantor and religious teacher with the Jewish community in the small Thuringian town of Heiligenstadt (Eichsfeld).Seherr-Tho√ü, Hans Christoph Graf von, \\"Loewe, Ludwig\\" in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 15 (1987), S. 77-78 [Online-Version]; URL: https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd117166839.html#ndbcontent After a commercial apprenticeship, Ludwig came to Berlin in 1858. He started as a wool merchant, dealing on commission. He then changed to repairing and dealing in machinery. In 1869, this led to the foundation of the Ludwig Loewe & Co.KG (Limited Joint Stock Partnership) with Ludwig Loewe as sole partner. The Company was established in the Berlin District of Neuk√∂lln to produce household sewing machines. Realizing that he could not compete with more precisely made and cheaper machines imported from U.S.A., he travelled to the US with his brother Isidor in 1870, leaving his company in the hands of his chief engineer Eduard Barthelmes. On his return, he started production of a new model, based on Barthelmes design, but manufactured on American precision machinery. The import of American machine tools led to the development and manufacture of lathes, grinders and milling machines and other machine tools. Together with Barthelmes, whose career had begun in the traditional Suhl weapons factories, Loewe began mass production of light weapons on his own precision, high volume machines. After the German victory in the Franco- Prussian War and German unification in 1870, Loewe was able to increase the capital of his company by contracting to manufacture Mauser 71 rifle parts for the Royal Prussian Arsenal in Spandau. In 1896/98, due to further expansion, the company moved to new premises in the district of Moabit and the present day neo-gothic, model factory complex was built in 1907‚Äì1917 with the help of American engineers. Loewe's intention was to create optimal working conditions necessary for high precision mass production. Loewe also provided modern housing, health and educational facilities for his employees. With the French introduction of smokeless nitro-cellulose gunpowder, Bismarck ordered the development of a rifle with a smaller calibre for the new nitro ammunition to be issued to the armed forces of all the German States. The first batch 88 rifle3 was to be manufactured by Loewe, as no other manufacturer was equipped with the necessary precision machine tooling. In 1889, Loewe was commissioned to manufacture 300 000 of the new rifles and deliver complete sets of production machinery to the state arsenals in Danzig, Spandau, Erfurt and Amberg. Both the new 88 rifle and German nitro-cellulose gunpowder turned out to be deficient and unreliable, leading to a large number of fatal accidents. This resulted in the \\"Jewish Carbine Affair\\" (Judenkarabiner Aff√§re). Hermann Alwart, an extreme nationalist, published an anti-Semitic pamphlet accusing Loewe of a Jewish conspiracy against the German Armed Forces. The pamphlet was suppressed with the help of Bismarck and the case was resolved in court where Alwart was convicted of slander.Die Deutschen Milit√§rgewehre und Maschinenpistolen 1871‚Äì1945, Hans Dieter G√∂tz, Motorbuch Verlag,  Ludwig Loewe's politics  Even though antisemitism, xenophobia and anti-Catholicism were widespread throughout Prussia, Frederic the Great (1712-1786) had established a measure of tolerance based on the principle of the utility of the individual for the aims of the Prussian state (\\"Religions must be tolerated and regulation must be limited to ensure that no harm is inflicted on others.\\" The King's marginal note on the \\"Immediate Report of the Clerical Department for Catholic Schools and Proselytizing\\"). Loewe's friends and acquaintances included the socialist leader Ferdinand Lasalle and the right wing politician and Bismarck's friend Walther Rathenau who, as Director for Raw Materials was responsible for organizing the war economy during WWI. Loewe was politically active as a member of the Berlin City Council. In 1877 he was elected to the Prussian House of Representatives for the Progressive Party. In 1878 he became a member of the Reichstag. Loewe's special interest was in education and DWM was instrumental in founding the Berlin Technical University. After Ludwig's death in 1886, his brother Isidor was the sole Director of the Company. His experience in banking and finance was central to the rapid expansion of the Company, diversifying into electrical engineering and motor transport.  Post WWI: The Quandt Group  The German defeat in WWI and the implementation of Allied restrictions on the production of military weapons left DWM with few alternatives. Small scale production of household goods. In 1922, DWM was re-named Berlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke and all production in the Moabit factory was terminated and ownership of the company passed to the Quandt Group. When Ludwig Loewe & Cie. merged with the Gesellschaft f√ºr Elektrische Unternehmungen in 1929, its ownership of DWM was transferred to a group of investors working with G√ºnther Quandt (the 'Quandt Gruppe' or 'Quandt Group'). In 1938 members of the Loewe family were expelled from the boards as part of a plan to minimize Jewish influence on German businesses.50 Jahre Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken Aktiengesellschaft1939, VDI-Verlag GmbH, Berlin The Gesellschaft f√ºr Elektrische Unternehmungen merged with AEG in 1942, the remainder of Loewe was named Loewe Werkzeugmaschienen AG of which AEG was owner. In 1946 the Loewe workshops took their old name \\"Ludw. Loewe & Co. AG\\". With some 400 workers they produced screwdrivers, ovens, gravecrosses and ploughs. The company joined forces with a group of other industrial companies in 1967 under the group name DIAG (Deutsche Industrieanlagen GmbH), today part of MAN Ferrostaal Industrieanlagen GmbH. Loewe and his faith Loewe suffered antisemitism, which also affected his family. A number of family members died in Nazi concentration camps, but some managed to escape to USA. His estate was later claimed by the Nazi government in the 1930s, and a claim was made against this action later on by his descendants.http://www.crt- ii.org/_awards/_apdfs/Ludwig_Loewe.pdf A single claimant was awarded 162,500 Swiss francs restitution by the Claims Resolution Tribunal.

He was a cofounder of the Acmeist movement. He was husband of Anna Akhmatova and father of Lev Gumilev. Nikolay Gumilev was arrested and executed by the Cheka, the secret Soviet police force, in 1921. Early life and poems Nikolay was born in the town of Kronstadt on Kotlin Island, into the family of Stepan Yakovlevich Gumilyov (1836‚Äì1910), a naval physician, and Anna Ivanovna L'vova (1854‚Äì1942). His childhood nickname was \\"Montigomo,\\" the Hawk's Claw.\\"Gumilyov's Magic Wand\\". Mikhail Sinelnikov. Moscow News (Russia). CULTURE; No. 15. April 18, 1996. He studied at the gymnasium of Tsarskoe Selo, where the Symbolist poet Innokenty Annensky was his teacher. Later, Gumilyov admitted that it was Annensky's influence that turned his mind to writing poetry. Nikolay Gumilyov, Anna Akhmatova and their son Lev Gumilev, 1913 His first publication were verses I ran from cities into the forest () on September 8, 1902. In 1905 he published his first book of lyrics entitled The Way of Conquistadors. It comprised poems on most exotic subjects imaginable, from Lake Chad giraffes to Caracalla's crocodiles. Although Gumilyov was proud of the book, most critics found his technique sloppy; later he would refer to that collection as apprentice's work. From 1907 and on, Nikolai Gumilyov traveled extensively in Europe, notably in Italy and France. In 1908 his new collection Romantic Flowers appeared. While in Paris, he published the literary magazine Sirius, but only three issues were produced. On returning to Russia, he edited and contributed to the artistic periodical Apollon. At that period, he fell in love with a non-existent woman Cherubina de Gabriak. It turned out that Cherubina de Gabriak was the literary pseudonym for two people: and Maximilian Voloshin. On November 22, 1909 he had a duel with Voloshin over the affair. Gumilev married Anna Akhmatova on April 25, 1910. He dedicated some of his poems to her. Poem by Gumilyov about Akhmatova, music and performance by Larisa Novoseltseva On September 18, 1912, their child Lev was born. He would eventually become an influential and controversial historian. Travel to Africa Portrait of Gumilev at African background by Olga Della-Vos-Kardovskaya, 1909 Like Flaubert and Rimbaud before him, but inspired by exploits of Alexander Bulatovich and Nikolay Leontiev, Gumilyov was fascinated with Africa and travelled there almost each year. He explored, helping development of Ethiopia, sometime hunted lions, and brought to the Saint Petersburg museum of anthropology and ethnography a large collection of African artifacts. His landmark collection The Tent (1921) collected the best of his poems on African themes, one of them \\"Giraffe\\"., poem by Gumilyov, with English translation, music and performance by Larisa Novoseltseva Guild of Poets In 1910, Gumilyov fell under the spell of the Russian Symbolist poet and philosopher Vyacheslav Ivanov and absorbed his views on poetry at the evenings held by Ivanov in his celebrated \\"Turreted House\\". His wife Akhmatova accompanied him to Ivanov's parties as well. Dissatisfied with the vague mysticism of Russian Symbolism, then prevalent in the Russian poetry, Gumilyov and Sergei Gorodetsky established the so-called Guild of Poets, which was modeled after medieval guilds of Western Europe. They advocated a view that poetry needs craftsmanship just like architecture needs it. Writing a good poem they compared to building a cathedral. To illustrate their ideals, Gumilev published two collections, The Pearls in 1910 and the Alien Sky in 1912. It was Osip Mandelstam, however, who produced the movement's most distinctive and durable monument, the collection of poems entitled Stone (1912). According to the principles of acmeism (as the movement came to be dubbed by art historians), every person, irrespective of his talent, may learn to produce high-quality poems if only he follows the guild's masters, i.e., Gumilyov and Gorodetsky. Their own model was Th√©ophile Gautier, and they borrowed much of their basic tenets from the French Parnasse. Such a program, combined with colourful and exotic subject matter of Gumilev's poems, attracted to the Guild a large number of adolescents. Several major poets, notably Georgy Ivanov and Vladimir Nabokov, passed the school of Gumilev, albeit informally. War experience When World War I started, Gumilyov hastened to Russia and enthusiastically joined a corps of elite cavalry. He fought in battles in East Prussia and Macedonia. For his bravery he was invested with two St. George crosses (December 24, 1914 and January 5, 1915). His war poems were assembled in the collection The Quiver (1916). In 1916 he wrote a verse play, Gondla, which was published the following year; set in ninth-century Iceland, torn between its native paganism and Irish Christianity, it is also clearly autobiographical, Gumilev putting much of himself into the hero Gondla (an Irishman chosen as king but rejected by the jarls, he kills himself to ensure the triumph of Christianity) and basing Gondla's wild bride Lera on Gumilev's wife Akhmatova (or maybe Larissa Reysner). The play was performed in Rostov na Donu in 1920. During the Russian Revolution, Gumilyov served in the Russian Expeditionary Force in France. Despite advice to the contrary, he rapidly returned to Petrograd. There he published several new collections, Tabernacle and Bonfire, and finally divorced Akhmatova (August 5, 1918), whom he had left for another woman several years prior. The following year he married Anna Nikolaevna Engelhardt, a noblewoman and daughter of a well-known historian. Execution In 1920 Gumilyov co-founded the All-Russia Union of Writers. Gumilev made no secret of his anti-communist views. He also made the Sign of the Cross in public and didn't care to hide his contempt for half-literate Bolsheviks. On August 3, 1921, he was arrested by the Cheka on charges of participation in a nonexistent monarchist conspiracy known as the \\"Petrograd military organization\\".Shentalinsky, \\"Crime Without Punishment\\", p. 286. On August 24, the Petrograd Cheka decreed execution of 61 participants of the case, including Nikolai Gumilev. They were shot on August 26 in the Kovalevsky Forest (the actual date was established only in 2014; previously it was thought he died on August 25). Maxim Gorky, his friend and fellow writer, hurried to Moscow and appealed to Lenin, but was unable to save Gumilev. Legacy Gumilyov's execution placed a stigma on Anna Akhmatova and on their son, Lev Gumilev. Lev was arrested later in the purges of the 1930s and spent almost two decades in the Gulag.Poems of Akhmatova, 1973, Staney Kunitz and Max Hayward, pub. Houghton Mifflin, pp. 15, 16. Despite Gumilyov's execution by the Cheka, Gondla was again performed in Petrograd in January 1922: \\"The play, despite its crowd scenes being enacted on a tiny stage, was a major success. Yet when the Petrograd audience called for the author, who was now officially an executed counter-revolutionary traitor, the play was removed from the repertoire and the theatre disbanded.\\"Donald Rayfield, \\"Gondla,\\" in Neil Cornwell and Nicole Christian (eds), Reference Guide to Russian Literature (Taylor & Francis, 1998: ), pp. 375-76. In February 1934, as they walked along a Moscow street, Osip Mandelstam quoted Gondla's words \\"I am ready to die\\" to Akhmatova, and she repeated them in her \\"Poem without a Hero.\\"Omry Ronen, An Approach to Mandel'≈°tam (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 302-03. Cultural influence Although banned in the Soviet times, Gumilev was loved for his adolescent longing for travel and giraffes and hippos, for his dreams of a fifteen-year-old captain\\" His \\"The Tram That Lost Its Way\\" is considered one of the greatest poems of the 20th century. *The Russian progressive rock band Little Tragedies used the poetry of Gumilyov in many of their songs, and had four albums which were entirely based on Gumilev's poetry (The Sun of the Spirit, Porcelain Pavilion, Return, Cross).http://littletragedies.com/GIsolo.htm * In 2016 an English translation of his verse drama Gondla was published by the Irish poet and diplomat Philip McDonagh and a production toured in Ireland.

It was founded in 1999. The band became well known for its hit Rakkautta ja piikkilankaa in 2004. The band's lyrics are in the Finnish language. All members are from the town of H√§meenkyr√∂, except the bassist Teemu Rajam√§ki, who is from Ikaalinen. Originally they called themselves 'Pincenez' but they did not get much positive feedback about it, so they renamed their band 'Uniklubi', a Finnish word that means 'Dream Club'.  Members of the band  * Jussi Selo (Born: January 21, 1985 in Tampere, Finland) - vocals * Janne Samuli Selo (Born: April 16, 1980) - guitars * Pasi Viitala (Born: March 6, 1983) - electronic guitar * Teemu Rajam√§ki - bass guitar * Antti Matikainen - drums Teemu Rajam√§ki left the band on March 19, 2012. This was announced on the band's homepage.  History  The band was founded in 1999 by Jussi and Pasi. The name \\"Uniklubi\\" didn't exist at the time; they went by the name Pincenez (type of glasses without spectacles; it's a French word). The first songs they played were covers of their favorite bands, in English. However, as they began writing their own songs, Jussi felt more confident with his mother tongue, Finnish. They eventually changed the name to Uniklubi (\\"dream club\\"), which has no significance for them, really. By playing their first gigs, they earned some money they used to go into studio and record their first demo-tapes. While recording the first album \\"Rakkautta Ja Piikkilankaa\\" (Love and Barbed- Wire) the drummer left the band. Antti Matikainen replaced him and has been part of Uniklubi ever since. The first single was \\"Rakkautta Ja Piikkilankaa\\". It was voted by YleX as the most popular song of the year. The album got into the charts (Top 4) and Uniklubi got their first important award: They won an Emma Award (Newcomer of the year). \\"Rakkautta Ja Piikkilankaa\\" reached platinum in Finland (They sold more than 30,000 copies of the album). Other releases of \\"Rakkautta Ja Piikkilankaa\\": Kylm√§√§, N√§iden T√§htien Alla and Totuus. The second album, \\"Keh√§\\" (Circle) was released on November 2 and the album entered the charts at number one. It stayed in the charts for more than 20 weeks in the Top20 and even the first release of the album \\"Kaikki Mit√§ M√§ Annoin\\" (All that I gave) entered the charts at number one. The second release was \\"Kiert√§√§ Keh√§√§\\" and entered the charts at number ten. During summer 2006, the singer was diagnosed with a bump on his vocal cords, after losing his voice repeatedly during concerts. The band had to cancel a tour in Germany, which would have been their first outside Scandinavia, for Jussi to undergo throat surgery. Everything went fine, and the few gigs performed during the Christmas holidays were marked by a beautiful, new clear voice. The band entered studios again at the beginning of 2007, and have already released their first single, \\"Vnus\\", in May, along with the track \\"Aurinkoni\\" (My Sun) as a b-side. The new album, titled \\"Luotisade\\" (Bullet Rain) was released in August 2007. On March 4, 2009 the band released a new album titled \\"Syv√§√§n valoon.\\" The first single from the album was \\"Polje\\". They later released \\"Kukka\\" as the new single. During the summer 2010 Uniklubi had several gigs added with the unique group of musicians. They had one pianist, two violinists, altoviolinist and cellist. On September 22, Uniklubi released their fifth studio album titled \\"Kultakalat\\" (Goldfishes). On 31 September the band started their album release tour which will last out until the late summer of 2011.  Related bands  Like many other Finnish bands, Uniklubi can easily be linked to other groups, whether by friendships or collaborations. Jussi Selo, singer for Uniklubi, has previously sung for Lovex, as well as guest backing vocals on some of Negative's tracks. More recently, he participated with backing vocals to the cover of Queen's \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\", interpreted by Negative's Jonne Aaron, Sir Christus and Larry Love, Jann Wilde and Rose Avenue's Jann Wilde and Dead By Gun's Christian. Ville Liimatainen, younger brother of Jonne, also contributed to the backing vocals. In Bloodpit's 2007 video \\"Wise Men Don't Cry\\", Jussi played a vengeful brother, alongside Antti Anatomy of Negative. He has also sung backing vocals on several songs for Finnish rock band, Sisu. Janne Selo previously sang for the band Bitch So Sweet, a quartet he left as Uniklubi took more of his time. He also replaced Entwine's guitarist for 5 concerts in their spring tour in Germany.

The wilderness consists of on the east side of the continental divide in the Wind River Range. Originally set aside as a primitive area in 1932, in 1984 the Wyoming Wilderness Act was passed securing a more permanent protection status for the wilderness. The wilderness is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season. Popo Agie Wilderness The Popo Agie Wilderness is a primarily sub-alpine and alpine region with the minimum elevation of . Twenty mountains exceed , with the highest being Wind River Peak at . Perhaps the most visited area within the wilderness and the entire Wind River Range is the Cirque of the Towers due to the impressive granitic mountains and sheer cliffs which attract climbers from all over the world. Overuse has led to camping restrictions within the wilderness, especially in the proximity of Lonesone Lake which is located in the Cirque of the Towers. The wilderness spans a section of the southern Wind River Range. Over 300 lakes and several tributaries of the Wind River are located in the wilderness. Rare reports of wolves have been documented and are considered to be from the wolf recovery efforts commenced in the late 20th century in Yellowstone National Park to the north. Additionally, reports of grizzly bears have been documented but they too are rare. Black bears, moose, elk, and pronghorn are the more commonly sighted megafauna. Trumpeter swans, bald eagles, hawks, and falcons inhabit the wilderness, especially near lakes and streams. Eight species and subspecies of trout, including a few found only in the Yellowstone region exist as well. The forest is dominated by lodgepole pine and Douglas fir, Engelmann Spruce, and subalpine fir at higher elevations up to the tree line. The closest town is Lander, Wyoming. Access into the wilderness from the north via the Wind River Indian Reservation requires obtaining a permit before entering.

It is named for Antoine Soulard and Julia C√©rre Soulard. Antoine Soulard first began to develop the land given to him by his father-in- law, Jean-Gabriel Cerr√©. Soulard was a surveyor for the Spanish government and a refugee from the French Revolution in the 1790s. One of the oldest communities in the city, Soulard is today a largely residential neighborhood whose many businesses include restaurants, bars, and the North American headquarters of Anheuser-Busch, which houses the St. Louis Brewery. Half of the neighborhood north of Lynch Street is composed mostly of row homes and small apartments with the Anheuser-Busch Brewery and headquarters occupying most of the land south of Lynch. Many of its houses date to the mid- to late-19th century. Soulard also has several historic churches. Many of its bars host live music, especially the blues and jazz bands for which the city is known. The barrelhouse blues piano player James Crutchfield lived in the neighborhood from 1984 until his death in 2001, and performed in many of the nightclubs. The district hosts regular pub crawls. There are various neighborhood groups, including the Soulard Restoration Group and the Soulard Business Association, that organize events, keep the neighborhood clean and safe, and publish a newspaper, The Soulard Renaissance. 1921 drawing of Soulard Market by Marguerite Martyn It is home to Soulard Farmers Market, the oldest farmers market west of the Mississippi.

It has been said St. Louis hosts the second-largest Mardi Gras party in the country. A neon sign commemorating Soulard Mardi Gras 2006 Like the New Orleans celebration, the Soulard version features several parades during the Mardi Gras season. On the second Sunday before Mardi Gras, there is a family-oriented pet parade dubbed \\"Krewe of Barkus\\", which features people and costumed pets. The parade is followed by the informal Wiener dog races. On the Saturday evening before Fat Tuesday, the more adult-oriented flesh-for-beads parade occurs, although there have been various attempts to reserve a family section at one end of the route. The east-west streets of Soulard, Geyer, Allen and Russell, and others are crowded with people from 7th to 12th Street. Several VIP tents are available for admission by fee and usually a national recording artist performs for free on a main stage, usually on 7th St. In recent years, the parade has been moved just north of Soulard to downtown St. Louis.

Gameplay  The aim of the game is to race others to the enzone and win with the highest score. Obstacles on the board ensure that the winner is not known until the very last roll of the dice or last play of the cards. Outcomes are determined by a combination of dice play, card play and good strategy. The game starts by the counters being placed in the starting grid and both sets of cards being placed on the board. Who goes first is quickly determined by a roll-off with one die. Players roll all six dice to start their turn, attempting to score as many points as possible without zouching (a scoreless roll). If a player does zouch they lose their entire breakscore for that turn but they have the choice of taking a zouch card. The zouch cards include both good and bad cards. Certain cards will give the player extra points or possible future advantage while others will create a challenge which if the player succeeds in they are rewarded. If a player has a good run in the game and scores with all six dice, they then have the choice of taking a boomer card. Boomer cards are mostly good. Remembering the game cards that have already come out is important, particularly when a cards pile is low and the stakes are high. Once a player is no longer willing to risk their breakscore, they sit and move their counter. If they then land on an occupied square, they zap that player, and that player goes back. Avoid the game board squares. As the game rages with players being zapped and cards being used to advantage, positions on the board can change radically. The game is almost finished once one of the players lands in the enzone. To finish, all the other players have one last-ditch turn to catch up with the other player. The winner of the game is the player on the highest board square in the enzone at the end.

History The Advocate began publication on 7 October 1887 as a weekly broadsheet newspaper, under the ownership of founder Arthur \\"Advocate\\" Smith. Five years later, it became a twice-weekly publication, and in 1898, the paper purchased their first typewriter. In 1933, Smith died, and was replaced by his son Arthur Fleming \\"Tod\\" Smith.

In 1974, the newspaper was purchased by Western Newspapers Ltd., a subsidiary of Consolidated Press Group, controlled by the Packer family. The next year, Mike Pritchard was appointed as editor, and continued in that role until 1990. In 1976, the newspaper changed to a weekly publication, released Wednesdays. In 1982, a move to develop the paper into a regional newspaper called The Valley Advocate with a wider-circulation proved unsuccessful. The paper was given away free outside of Scone, but local residents were still required to pay twenty five cents to buy a copy. In 1984, the Scone Advocate banner was restored, with a new publication date of Thursday (which is still the case today. Also in that year, the Packer-controlled Regional Publishers Pty. Ltd. was merged with Upper Hunter Newspapers, owned by the McClintock family of Muswellbrook, to form Upper Hunter Publishers Pty. Ltd. This led to the paper being published off-site in Muswellbrook, with its commercial printing division sold to a private company in 1986. In 1987, Rural Press Limited purchased Regional Newspapers' group of publications, including the Advocate, and printing moved again, this time to the Maitland Mercury site. In 1990, Anthony \\"Tony\\" Newman takes over from Pritchard as editor for the next two and a half years. In 1991, the newspaper launched its first complimentary magazine for that year's Scone Horse Week. A succession of female editors soon followed, with Annella \\"Nella\\" Powell taking control in 1993, and Rhonda Turner in 1994. In 1996, the Advocate was compiled on site for the first time using the Quark Xpress system, replacing the Atex system that had to be accessed in Muswellbrook. In 1997, the publication began to use colour on a regular basis for the first time starting on 4 December. The Advocate acquired a digital camera in 2000, and also launched their website that year. Also in 2000, Rural Press sold off the Advocate's long-time headquarters to local businessmen, and moved into rented premises in 2001. Turner resigned as editor in 2002, and since then a number of journalists have worked at the Advocate. In 2005, the printing facilities were moved, this time to Tamworth at the Northern Daily Leader site. In 2007, Fairfax Media acquired Rural Press in an agreed merger, while locally, the paper's Macintosh computers were replaced with PCs. The paper celebrated its 120th anniversary in October with the discovery of old film footage from the first few months of transmission of NBN Television, which looked at the operations of a local newspaper. National attention The newspaper drew national media attention for its coverage of a gruesome murder in Aberdeen in the late 1990s, particularly from the ABC program Media Watch in 2000.http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s123304.htm The newspaper was criticized by the program, local readers and the victim's family for its graphic coverage. The editor at the time, Rhonda Turner, defended the newspaper and its reporting of the incident. Prior to this, the newspaper's articles had appeared as part of the game show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush.

Career  Miller began work as a journalist in 1983 for WNEW, a local New York City television station. From 1985 to 1994, he worked as an investigative journalist for WNBC, another local New York television station. During his tenure at the station, he conducted several interviews with John Gotti. From 1994 to 1995, he served as deputy police commissioner of New York City, where he was the chief spokesman for the NYPD,John Miller Named Assistant Director of FBI Office of Public Affairs, FBI National Press Office, August 23, 2005. a move that some of his colleagues considered \\"going over to the dark side.\\" He was hired at the request of then Commissioner William Bratton. Miller worked as an ABC News correspondent beginning in 1995. Using an al-Qaeda agent in London as an intermediary, Miller was able to make contact with Mohammed Atef to request an interview with Osama bin Laden in May 1998. Miller was instructed to travel to Islamabad, Pakistan, and was escorted over the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to meet bin Laden in a camp near Kandahar. He asked bin Laden questions that were translated into Arabic by an al-Qaeda translator, but bin Laden's answers were not translated, so Miller was not immediately aware of what bin Laden was saying during the interview. During his tenure at ABC, Miller also covered the September 11, 2001 attacks, where he sat alongside Peter Jennings for the duration of the day listening in to radio conversations from the FBI, FDNY and NYPD, informing Jennings and viewers of their content. In January 2002, Miller took the post of co-anchor with Barbara Walters of the ABC News program, 20/20. In January 2003, he left ABC News to rejoin Bratton, who by then was at the Los Angeles Police Department. Miller served as the police department's Bureau Chief for the Counter-Terrorism and Criminal Intelligence Bureau, which included the Major Crimes Division, and the Emergency Services Division and the Special Investigations Section (SIS). While there, Miller launched Project Archangel which included the Automated Critical Asset Management System (ACAMS), among other platforms, and which has been adopted by other cities and states for ongoing risk-assessment of potential terrorist targets. Miller was also one of the original designers of the Los Angeles Joint Regional Intelligence Center (JRIC), which combines intelligence and analysis for the LAPD, LA Sheriff, and the FBI. In September 2005, Miller became the Assistant Director for Public Affairs at the FBI in Washington, D.C. In this position, he was tasked with overseeing the FBI's internal and external communications, including relations with the news media and handling of fugitive publicity, community relations, and other communications support. Miller also established an Employee Communications Unit to build stronger internal communications to the bureau's 31,000 employees. Among his collateral duties was to serve on the Strategic Execution Team (SET) to establish performance measurement standards for intelligence operations across the FBI's 56 field offices. The system, adapted from the CompStat process used by major police departments, was overseen by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller. In 2011, Miller left his position at the FBI to work as a senior correspondent for CBS News. In 2013, he reported in the \\"Inside the NSA\\" episode of 60 Minutes which was criticized for justifying the organization's spying on American citizens. In December 2013, Miller announced that he would be resigning from CBS in order to take a position as the Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence & Counterterrorism with the NYPD. Miller rejoined William Bratton, who had earlier been announced as the new NYPD Commissioner by Mayor Bill de Blasio. =Awards and honors= Miller's journalistic awards include two Peabody Awards, a DuPont-Columbia Award, 2014 Winners and nine Emmys. =Memberships and affiliations= He is a member of the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

In 1976, he wrote The Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency. He had multiple roles as a writer, broadcaster, environmentalist, agrarian, smallholder and activist; a rebel against: consumerism, industrialisation, genetically modified organisms, cities, motor cars; an advocate for: self-reliance, personal responsibility, self- sufficiency, conviviality (food, drink, dancing and singing), gardening, caring for the Earth and for the soil. Early life Seymour was born in Hampstead, London, England; His father was Albert Angus Turbayne, a skilled bookbinder and designer. His parents separated and his mother, Christine Owens, remarried and the family moved to the seaside town of Frinton-on-Sea in north-east Essex. It was however surrounded by agricultural land, and the life led by those on the land and in small boats laid a foundation for his later vision of a simple cottage economy with farming and fishing providing the essentials of life. After schooling in England and Switzerland, he studied agriculture at Wye College, In 1934, at the age of 20, he went to Southern Africa where he held a succession of jobs: a farmhand and then manager of a sheep farm, a deckhand and skipper of a snoek fishing boat operating from Namibia (then South-West Africa) along the Skeleton Coast, a copper mine worker in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia), and a worker for the government veterinary service. Whilst in Africa he spent some time with bushmen where he gained friendship and an insight into the life of hunter gatherers. 1939 to 1951 At the start of World War II in 1939, Seymour travelled to Kenya where he enlisted in the Kenya Regiment, and was posted to the King's African Rifles. He fought against Italian troops in the Abyssinian Campaign in Ethiopia. The regiment was then posted to Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) and afterwards to Burma, where allied forces were fighting against Japan. For Seymour the war ended on a low note; he expressed his disgust when the Allies used fission bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On his return to Britain after the war Seymour worked for a while on a Thames sailing barge 'Cambria', skippered by Bob Roberts, operating around the south and east coasts of England, where he picked up the folk songs of a disappearing occupation. After working as a labour officer for the War Agricultural Executive Committee finding agricultural work for German prisoners of war who had still not returned home, he started writing and broadcasting on the BBC Home Service. He travelled overland to India for the BBC, gaining experience of the Subsistence agriculture still common in eastern Europe and Asia. His experiences on that journey led to his first book, The Hard Way to India, published in 1951. The Smallholdings Seymour was living aboard a Dutch sailing smack when he married Sally Medworth, an Australian potter and artist in 1954. In this they travelled around the waterways and rivers of England, journeys later described in Sailing through England. As their first daughter grew older they felt that a land-base would be more suitable. They leased two isolated cottages on of land near Orford in Suffolk. These 5 acres are still called Seymour's Bit by the current owner. The manner in which they developed self-sufficiency on this smallholding is recounted in The Fat of the Land (1961). At the end of the 1960s, Seymour, along with other radical voices like Herbert Read, Edward Goldsmith, Leopold Kohr and Fritz Schumacher, provided a stream of articles for the journal Resurgence edited from 1966‚Äì1970 by John Papworth. In 1964 the family moved to a farm near Newport, Pembrokeshire. The 1970s saw Seymour's publication rate reach its peak. In 1973 John and Sally wrote Self-Sufficiency and in 1976 The Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency was published. Appearing shortly after the publication of E.F. Schumacher's Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered (1973) and The Good Life's first showing on British television (1975), the sales of the book exceeded all expectations. It was also set to establish the reputation of two young publishers, Christopher Dorling and Peter Kindersley who had commissioned and edited the work. In addition to self-sufficiency he wrote four guide books in the Companion Guide series. John also made many television programmes: an early series followed the footsteps of George Borrow's Wild Wales (1862). In the early 1980s he spent three years making the BBC series Far From Paradise (with Herbert Girardet) which examined the history of human impact on the environment. His farm in Wales welcomed visitors seeking guidance on the smallholder's life, a project which continued when he moved to County Wexford in Ireland. Here in 1999 he was taken to court for destroying a crop of GM sugar beet. For the last years of his life, he lived back on his old Pembrokeshire farm with his daughter's family. He died there on 14 September 2004 and is buried in the top field in an orchard that he planted. Legacy His obituary in the Guardian said: :John was as much at home in the humblest house on a hillside, as in the manor house of landed gentry. He was like a force of nature, always willing to listen, always interested in learning about new - or very old - ways of working the land. He was a one-man rebellion against modernism ...

Pertec's most successful products were hard disk drives and tape drives, which were sold as OEM to the top computer manufacturers, including IBM, Siemens and DEC. Pertec manufactured multiple models of seven and nine track half-inch tape drives with densities 800CPI (NRZI) and 1600CPI (PE) and phase-encoding formatters, which were used by a myriad of original equipment manufacturers as I/O devices for their product lines. In the 1970s, Pertec entered the computer industry through several acquisitions of computer producers and started manufacturing and marketing mostly minicomputers for data processing and pre-processing. This split up Pertec into two companies. Pertec Peripherals Corporation (PPC), which remained based in Chatsworth, California, and Pertec Computer Corporation (PCC), which was located at 17112 Armstrong Avenue, in Irvine, California. Pertec and MITS Close up of the Altair 8800B. Currently on display at the Living Computer Museum in Seattle, Washington. Pertec bought MITS, the manufacturers of the MITS Altair computer, for US$6.5 million in 1976. This purchase was motivated mainly by the ownership of the Microsoft BASIC sources and general license that Pertec erroneously assumed to be included in the deal. They also acquired iCOM, makers of micro peripherals, in the same year. They believed that these acquisitions would change them from selling computers mostly for hobbyists, to selling them for small businesses. Pertec changed their name, after the acquisition of MITS, from Pertec Corporation to Pertec Computer Corporation to \\"be more reflective of the company's present position and to clearly state our future direction\\". As a result of the acquisition, Pertec became involved in the manufacturing of microprocessor-based computers. Their first models were expanded versions of the Altair models, typically coupled to the existing disk-drive range. Despite initially good sales, the Altair's 8080 CPU was becoming increasingly outdated, so Pertec decided to retire the Altair as well as the MITS name itself. In 1978, the company launched the first of its own designs, the PCC-2000. This was based on two Intel 8085 series microprocessors: one of which was given over to I/O control. Being a high end machine, it was intended to be the core of what would now be described as a workgroup. The machine was intended to support four \\"dumb\\" terminals connected via RS-232 serial lines, in addition to its internal console. The basic machine had twin 8-inch floppy drives, each capable of storing 1.2 megabytes and could link to two Pertec twin 14-inch disk drives, giving a total of 22.4 megabytes of storage, which was a very large amount for the time. The system was generally supplied with a multi-user operating system called MTX, which included a BASIC interpreter that was similar to Business Basic. The PCC-2000 was also available with MITS DOS or CP/M. In the UK, several systems were run under BOS. Unfortunately, the PCC-2000 was too expensive for the market and was never a great success. Pertec Business Systems =Pertec/MITS 300= Pertec/MITS 300/55 Business System. Currently on display at the Living Computer Museum in Seattle, Washington. The MITS 300 was the first product built and released by the Pertec after their acquisition of MITS in 1977. They produced the 300/25 and the 300/55. Both were fully integrated systems that included both hardware and software in one package. The 300/25 used Pertec floppy diskette drives and the 300/55 added Pertec DC-3000 14-inch hard disk. The system consists of the MITS 2nd generation Altair 8800 (or Altair 8800b) computer with hard drive controller and MITS datakeeper storage system. The complete 300/55 business system sold for $15,950 and included the Altair 8800b with 64k of dynamic RAM, a CRT terminal and a desk. The system was designed to handle a variety of business applications including word processing, inventory control and accounting. This system was prone to overheating and had a very short life span. The new system allowed for MITS peripherals including Altair Floppy Disc, Altair Line Printer, Teletypewriter, and the Altair CRT terminal. The printer was a bidirectional Mits/Altair C-700 that could print 60 characters/second and 26 lines/minute. =Pertec PCC-2100= Pertec's primary line of computer products was aimed at the key-to-disk minicomputer systems that were used as front-end data processors for the IBM 360/370 and similar systems. This line was opened in the first half of the 1970s by the Pertec PCC-2100 data entry system, which was essentially different from the PCC-2000 mentioned above. The system was able to serve up to 16 coaxial terminals, two D3000 disk drives and one T1640 tape drive. =Pertec XL-40= Pertec XL-40, introduced in 1977, was a more successful successor of Pertec PCC-2100. The XL-40 machine used custom 16-bit processors built from the TI3000 or AMD2900 slices, up to 512 KB operating memory and dedicated master-capable DMA controllers for tape units, floppy and rigid disk units, printers, card reader and terminals. The maximum configuration came in two different versions. One featured four T1600 / T1800 tape units (manufactured by Pertec), two floppy disk units (manufactured by IBM or Pertec) and four D1400 / D3400 rigid disk units (4.4, 8.8, 17.6 MB formatted capacity, manufactured by Pertec or Kennedy). The other one featured two large capacity disk units (up to 70 MB formatted capacity, manufactured by Kennedy or NEC), one line printer connected through long-line interface (DataProducts LP600, LP1200, B300, Printronix P300, P600), four station printers connected through coaxial cable (Centronics), one card reader (Pertec), four SDLC communication channels and 30 proprietary coax terminals (Model 4141 with 40x12 characters or Model 4143 with 80x25 characters). The system was mainly used for key-to-disk operations to replace the previously popular IBM card punches and more advanced key-to- tape systems manufactured for example by Mohawk Data Sciences (MDS) or Singer. In addition to the basic key-to-disk function, the proprietary operating system, called XLOS, supported indexed file operations for on-line transaction processing even with data journaling. The system was programmed in two different ways. The data entry was either described in several tables that specified the format of the input record with optional automatic data validation procedures or the indexed file operations were programmed in a special COBOL dialect with IDX and SEQ file support. System maintenance operations were performed in a protected supervisor mode; the system supported batched operations in the supervisor mode through the use of batch files that specified operator selections. The operating system interacted with the user through a series of prompts with automatic on-screen explanations and default selections, probably the ultimate user-friendliness achievable in text-only human-computer interaction. The XL-40 was also marketed by Triumph-Adler in Europe as TA1540, the beginning of a relationship that would eventually see a merger of the two companies. =Pertec 3200= Pertec's final in-house computer design was a complete departure, the MC68000-based Series 3200. The primary operating system was an in-house developed multi-tasking, multi-user operating system, but it could also run Unix. As with the XL40, Triumph-Adler marketed the system in Europe under their own brand with the model name MSX 3200 (There were four models, eventually, in the Triumph-Adler series: 3200, 3220, 3230 and 3240). The key to disk application from the XL40 was re- implemented on the 3200. The other main application was a BASIC language driven database, similar to the ones used by MAI Basic Four or Pick operating system. These BASIC database business systems would be purchased by outside companies that bundled the PCC 3200 with their software to provide a complete small business package (accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, inventory, sales tracking, taxes, etc.) customized for specific businesses. The 3200 was extremely advanced for the time, being intended to support up to 32 users, all using intelligent Z80-based terminals, each of which could optionally run CP/M attached to the 3200's high speed coax cable. Later an ISA bus to 3200 coax interface was made for the PC, and this allowed the usage of PC's as smart terminals for the 3200 or as networked systems running MS-DOS. It was the first Pertec product to support the emerging \\"Winchester\\" standard for miniature hard disks. Eventual fate Soon after the introduction of the 3200, Pertec Computer Corporation was purchased by Triumph-Adler. Later PCC was acquired by Scan-Optics in February 1987. During the transition from systems based on custom-made CPUs to CPUs made by Intel and Motorola, prices for these systems dropped dramatically, but without an offsetting increase in demand, and eventually companies such as PCC slowly dwindled away to small remnants of their peak days in the mid-1980s, or were bought out by larger companies. Pertec's PPC magnetic tape interface standard of the early 1970s rapidly became an industry-wide standard and is still in use by tape drive manufacturers today. Similarly, its PERTEC disk interface was an industry standard for pre-Winchester disk drives of the 1970s.

It has a population of about 1,500, measured at the 2011 census as 1,804. It lies north of the A47 road east of Leicester, and runs directly into the built up area of Thurnby and Bushby to the south. For local government the village forms part of the district of Harborough, and constitutes a civil parish. Rail transport The Thurnby and Scraptoft railway station (which connected to the Great Northern Railway) closed to passenger traffic in the mid-1950s. Seaside excursions and freight continued to use the line until around 1964, and in the early part of 1965 the track was lifted and the bridge across the road on Station Road was demolished.  Road transport  Services through, to or from Scraptoft were run by Ernest Jordan of Halstead near Tilton-on-the-Hill in the early years of the 20th century. Hincks of Hungarton also ran services until c1930 when the company was taken over by the \\"Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd.\\" (B.M.M.O.), known as Midland Red. The 'BMMO' ran a service for many years through to Hungarton numbered originally 599, later renumbered to 598 (1968), 649 (1978) and finally 149 (1980) and for a period (1957-1964) was extended on to Twyford and John 'O Gaunt Station as an X64. This replaced the discontinued train service which had run previously, known as the workers' service. The Hungarton service was maintained until around 1981. A school service numbered S21 was operated for a few years in the later 1960s / early 1970s as a mornings only Scraptoft Green - Somerby Road School run. Oddly, no return afternoon facility ever existed. BMMO also ran its more regular services into Leicester originally numbered L29 from around 1930 - renumbered 93 (1972) and 79 / 89 (1980) also until 1972 a Service L15 to Oadby, Wigston and Enderby. Into the mid 1980s and 1990s a more frequent mini-bus service was established by the successor of BMMO, renamed Midland Fox in the de-regulation era, numbered M2, later 52, the high frequency being attributed to the Leicester Polytechnic / De Montford University Scraptoft Campus site, however the campus has since closed and been replaced with a housing development and the current service is being operated by Arriva Midlands as a Service 56 on a much reduced frequency, with no services in the evenings or on Sundays. Other operators known to have run services were Nesbit Bros. Coaches of Somerby which ran a Tuesdays only service to Melton Mowbray commenced in 1976 for approx. 10 years, also Fosse Travel ran a Market Harborough weekly shopper. Since the 1980s a variety of infrequent services from the Rutland area to Leicester have passed through Scraptoft operated by Blands of Cottesmore, Paul James Coaches, Skinners of Saltby, Kinchbus, Barton Transport, Abu & Sons, Arriva Fox County and Mark Bland Travel. More recently, since the spring of 2006 the 'Rural Rider' network now covers Scraptoft and much of the sparsely populated East Leicestershire area. This network is now facing replacement with a taxi operated demand responsive service provided by Leicestershire County Council. This, it has been announced, will commence during May 2015.  Facilities  =Shops= The current newsagents on Main Street (2010) was once an inn, called the \\"Pear Tree\\". The village has a small Co-operative food store, and adjacent Post office. These shops serve the passing traffic of the outlying villages to the east and north-east, most of which lack shops although a few still have public houses. During the mid-1970s there was a short-lived cafe on Main Street, called 'The Bambi Cafe'. The premises later became a greengrocers/florists, and then a private dwelling. A garage/filling station and a hairdressing salon were also located on Main Street, both of which are now gone and replaced by private dwellings. A public house called 'The White House' is located on Scraptoft Lane and is constructed of Ketton stone from Normanton Hall in Rutland, demolished around 1926. The property was bought by the Northampton Brewery Company and became a hotel in 1950.From: 'Scraptoft', A History of the County of Leicestershire: Volume 5: Gartree Hundred (1964), pp. 287-292. URL: Date accessed: 29 October 2010. It was bought by the JD Wetherspoon group in 2010. =Community facilities= Much of the village is a conservation area. The village has a Green, which at one time had the traditional red telephone box and adjacent pillar box. Over the years, with safety improvements due to increased traffic, the area has altered to become little more than a road junction. The Village Institute, or Village hall, is located by this junction and is used for community events. An open space recreation area, known as the Edith Cole memorial park, which has an Eevee spawn, is located opposite the All Sai nts Church, Pok√©mon Stop, on Church Hill. About a mile to the north-east of the village, on the road to Keyham, is the newly established 'Scraptoft natural burial ground'. History Scraptoft Hall Scraptoft was recorded in the Domesday Book as Scrapentot, part of Gartree wapentake. It was held by Coventry Abbey, and had increased in value from 2 shillings at the time of the Norman Conquest to 40 shillings in 1086. The village is the site of various historic buildings including Scraptoft Hall, which is a Grade II* listed building. The Hall and its grounds were for many years used as a campus of De Montfort University and its predecessors, but this facility was closed in 2003. The grounds of the house have been proposed for development as a brown field housing site. =Quorn Hunt= The Quorn Hunt at one time met regularly throughout the fox hunting season on Fridays in the village, at the Nether Hall, built in 1709. The Hunt would move off and hunt fox coverts along Covert Lane to the east of the village towards Ingarsby. Sport The village is host to the Scraptoft golf course, and is also host to a number of sports teams at Covert Lane, including Jimmies Rugby Club. It is also home to Aylestone St James RFC. There is also a beginners running/jogging club, Scraptoft Joggers. Education Scraptoft does not have a school. Village children attended Thurnby St. Lukes School until the late 1960s when Thurnby Somerby Road (Fernvale) School was opened, from there they went on to Manor High School (Oadby) or Gartree High School and Beauchamp College at Oadby.

Early life  Jaswant Singh of Marwar died at Jamrud in December 1678. His two wives were pregnant but, there being no living male heir, the lands in Marwar were converted by the emperor Aurangzeb into territories of the Mughal empire so that they could be managed as jagirs. He appointed Indra Singh Rathor, a nephew of Jaswant Singh, as ruler there. Historian John F. Richards stresses that this was intended as a bureaucratic exercise rather than an annexation. There was opposition to Aurangzeb's actions because both pregnant women gave birth to sons during the time that he was enacting his decision. In June 1679, Durgadas Rathor, a senior officer of the former ruler, led a delegation to Shahjahanabad where they pleaded with Aurangzeb to recognise the older of these two sons, Ajit Singh, as successor to Jaswant Singh and ruler of Marwar. Aurangzeb refused, offering instead to raise Ajit and to give him the title of raja, with an appropriate noble rank, when he attained adulthood. However, the offer was conditional on Ajit being brought up as a Muslim, which was anathema to the petitioners. The Six Sons of Maharaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur on a Visit Posthumous Portrait of Maharaja Ajit Singh of Marwar, 1762. Brooklyn Museum. The dispute escalated when Ajit Singh's younger brother died. Aurangzeb sent a force to capture the two queens and Ajit from the Rathor mansion in Shahjahanabad but his attempt was rebuffed by Durgadas Rathor, who initially used gunfire in retaliation and eventually escaped from the city to Jodhpur along with Ajit and the two queens, who were disguised as men. Some of those accompanying the escapees detached themselves from the party and were killed as they fought to slow down the pursuing Mughals. The Dhaa Maa (wet nurse) of Infant prince Ajit Singh of Marwar, Goora Dhaa (The Sainik Kshatriyas Gehlot Rajput of Mandore) put her beloved son on the royal bed Instead of Ajit Singh and put the sleeping prince Ajit into a basket and smuggle him with others out of Delhi. Aurangzeb deigned to accept this deceit and sent the child to be raised as a Muslim in his harem. The child was renamed Mohammadi Raj and the act of changing religion meant that, by custom, the imposter lost all hereditary entitlement to the lands of Marwar that he would otherwise have had if he had indeed been Ajit Singh.  Exile  Continuing to play along with the deceit, Aurangzeb refused to negotiate with representatives of Ajit Singh, claiming that child to be the imposter. He sent his son, Muhammad Akbar, to occupy Marwar. Ajit Singh's mother, who was a Sisodia, convinced the Rana of Mewar, Raj Singh I, who is commonly thought to be her relative, to join in fighting against the Mughals. Richards says that Raj Singh's fear that Mewar would also be invaded was a major motivation for becoming involved; another historian, Satish Chandra, thinks that there were several possible alternatives, including Singh seeing an opportunity to assert Mewar's position among the Rajput principalities of the region. The combined Rathor-Sisodia forces were no match for the Mughal army, Mewar was itself attacked and the Rajputs had to retire to the hills, from where they engaged in sporadic guerrilla warfare. For 20 years after this event, Marwar remained under the direct rule of a Mughal governor. During this period, Durgadas Rathore carried out a relentless struggle against the occupying forces. Trade routes that passed through the region were plundered by the guerrillas, who also looted various treasuries in present-day Rajasthan and Gujarat. These disorders adversely impacted the finances of the empire. Aurangzeb died in 1707; he was to prove the last of the great Mughals. Durgadas Rathor took advantage of the disturbances following this death to seize Jodhpur and eventually evict the occupying mughal force.N.S. Bhati, Studies in Marwar History, page 6  Takes charge of Marwar  After consolidating his rule over Marwar, Ajit Singh grew increasingly bold as the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah had marched south. He formed an alliance with Sawai Raja Jai Singh II of Amer and set upon capturing his ancestral lands which had been occupied by the Mughals. The Rajput kings started raiding Mughal camps and outposts, several towns and forts were captured, the biggest blow for the Mughals was however the capture of Sambhar which was an important Salt manufacturing site.Thelen, Elizabeth M. (2018). Intersected Communities: Urban Histories of Rajasthan, c. 1500 ‚Äì 1800 (PDF) (Thesis). University of California, Berkeley. Pg.37 In 1709 Ajit Singh made plans to conquer Ajmer and destroy the Muslim shrines and Mosques, however Jai Singh II was afraid that the destruction of Muslim shrines would lead to the wrath of the Mughal emperor after he had returned from the Deccan. Ajit Singh however ignored Jai Singhs advise and led his army towards Ajmer, ending the Rathor-Kachwaha alliance. Ajit Singh laid siege to Ajmer on 19 February, the Mughal garrison led by Shujaat Khan negotiated with Ajit Singh by offering him 45,000 rupees, 2 horses, an elephant and the holy town of Pushkar in exchange for sparing the shrine and the mosques. Ajit Singh agreed to the terms and returned to his capital.Thelen, Elizabeth M. (2018). Intersected Communities: Urban Histories of Rajasthan, c. 1500 ‚Äì 1800 (PDF) (Thesis). University of California, Berkeley. Pg.37-38 In June 1710 Bahadur Shah I marched to Ajmer with a large army and called Ajit Singh to Ajmer, he was joined by Jai Singh II. The rebellious Ajit Singh was finally pardoned and was formally accepted as the Raja of Jodhpur by the Mughal emperor.The Cambridge History of India, Volume 3 p. 322 In 1712 Ajit Singh was given more power with his appointment as Mughal governor of Gujarat.Richards, The Mughal Empire, p. 262 Role in deposition of Farrukhsiyar In 1713 the new Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Ajit Singh governor of Thatta. Ajit Singh refused to go to the impoverished province and Farrukhsiyar sent Husain Ali Braha to bring Ajit Singh into line, but also sent a private letter to Ajit Singh promising him blessings if he defeated Husain. Instead Ajit Singh chose to negotiate with Husain, accepting the governorship of Thatta with a promise for a return to Gujarat in the near future.Richards, The Mughals, p. 166 One of the other conditions of the peace agreement was the marriage of one of the daughters of the Jodhpur Raja with the Mughal emperor, Ajit Singh agreed Marry His Daughter to Farrukhsiyar But Instead, He Married His Daughter's Maid To The Mughal Emprepor On The Advice Of The Jat King Churaman. Ajit Singh used this marriage as a political tool, giving him enough time to forge alliances against the emperor. Ajit Singh later took his revenge by making an alliance with the Sayyid brothers against Farrukhsiyar. Ajit Singh and his allies, besieged Farrukhsiyar in the Red Fort and after a night-long battle entered the palace grounds, at first Qutb-Ul-Mulk tried to stop Ajit Singh from entering, upon which the enraged Ajit stabbed him to death and told his Rajput and Pathan soldiers to arrest Farrukhsiyar. The emperor was caught hiding in the harem with his mother, wives and daughters, he tried to resist but was caught and dragged to a small room in Tripoliya gate, where he was tortured and blinded with a needle. The old Mughal officials cried for mercy and Raja Jai singh of Jaipur and Nizam-Ul-Mulk of Hyderabad did send threats but none of them took any action. Rafi-Ud-Darjat was chosen from the princes and Ajit Singh and the Nawab took his hand and placed him on the peacock throne.  Final days  Jai Singh II advised Abhai Singh to kill his father Ajit Singh as Muhammad Shah had sworn to avenge Farrukhsiyar by destroying Jodhpur. Abhai Singh either out of greed or to save his country from destruction, made plans to kill his father with the help of his brother Bakht Singh. The deed was done in 1724 and Abhai Singh succeeded as the new Maharaja of Marwar.Vir Vinod The practice of sati was common among Rajput nobility in the region: 63 women accompanied Maharaja Ajit Singh onto the funeral pyre.

The poem describes the events of the Finnish War (1808‚Äì1809) in which Sweden lost its eastern territories; these would become incorporated into the Russian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Finland. Description V√•rt Land. The first part of Ensign St√•l was first published in the revolutionary year 1848, the second in 1860. It shaped Finnish identity and was later given out free during the Winter War to raise patriotic spirit. The first chapter of the poem also became the national anthem of Finland. The name of the title character, \\"St√•l\\", is Swedish for steel, a typical example of a so-called \\"soldier's name\\". These were names, often consisting of simple words for traits or traits related to the military or nature, given to Swedish soldiers by their commanders, and many of Runeberg's characters have them: Dufva, Sv√§rd and Hurtig ('pigeon', 'sword' and 'quick') are other examples The poems of Ensign St√•l feature several officers who fought in the Finnish War, including marshals Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor and Johan August Sandels, generals , Carl Johan Adlercreutz, and Georg Carl von D√∂beln, and Colonel Otto von Fieandt. Among the most famous characters is the simple but heroic rotesoldat Sven Dufva. The organisations Lotta Sv√§rd and the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Organization (\\"Lottorna\\") were named after the character in the poem of the same name. From its publication to the mid-twentieth Century, The Tales of Ensign St√•l was staple reading in both Finnish and Swedish schools. It shaped the later image of the war and of some of its real-life protagonists. Admiral Carl Olof Cronstedt is mainly remembered today for his treacherous surrender of the fortress of Sveaborg. The Russian general Yakov Kulnev, on the other hand, is described positively as a chivalrous and brave soldier and ladies' man. Ensign St√•l was translated into Finnish by a group led by fennoman professor Julius Krohn in 1867. Later translations were made by Paavo Cajander in 1889 and Otto Manninen 1909. Albert Edelfelt drew the illustrations between 1894‚Äì1900. Due to the dated language, a new translation was issued in 2007. It raised some controversy, in particular due to the new wording of the poem V√•rt Land, the national anthem of Finland.

The most common type, also known as candidemia, candedemia, or systemic candidiasis, is caused by Candida species; candidemia is also among the most common bloodstream infections of any kind. Infections by other fungi, including Saccharomyces, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus, are also called fungemia. It is most commonly seen in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients with severe neutropenia, cancer patients, or in patients with intravenous catheters. It has been suggested the otherwise immunocompetent patients taking infliximab may be at a higher risk for fungemia. Diagnosis is difficult, as routine blood cultures have poor sensitivity.Finding the ‚ÄúMissing 50%‚Äù of Invasive Candidiasis: How Nonculture Diagnostics Will Improve Understanding of Disease Spectrum and Transform Patient Care, Cornelius J.

Many symptoms may be associated with fungemia, including pain, acute confusion, chronic fatigue, and infections. Skin infections can include persistent or non-healing wounds and lesions, sweating, itching, and unusual discharge or drainage. Risk factors Pathogens The most commonly known pathogen is Candida albicans, causing roughly 70% of fungemias, followed by Candida glabrata with 10%, Aspergillus with 1% and Saccharomyces as the fourth most common. However, the frequency of infection by C. glabrata, Saccharomyces boulardii, Candida tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis is increasing, perhaps because significant use of fluconazole is common or due to increase in antibiotic use. Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) yeast that can cause invasive infections and is associated with high mortality. It was first described in 2009 after being isolated from external ear discharge of a patient in Japan. Since the 2009 report, C. auris infections, specifically fungemia, have been reported from South Korea, India, South Africa, and Kuwait. Although published reports are not available, C. auris has also been identified in Colombia, Venezuela, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom. Treatment Neutropenic vs non-neutropenic candidemia is treated differently. An intravenous echinocandin such as anidulafungin, caspofungin or micafungin is recommended as first-line therapy for fungemia, specifically candidemia. Oral or intravenous fluconazole is an acceptable alternative. The lipid formulation amphotericin B is a reasonable alternative if there is limited antifungal availability, antifungal resistance, or antifungal intolerance.

The Wool Exchange Building in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England is a grade I-listed building built as a wool-trading centre in the 19th century. The grandeur of its Gothic Revival architecture is symbolic of the wealth and importance that wool brought to Bradford. Today it is a Waterstones bookshop as well as a cafe.  Design history  It was built between 1864 and 1867. The commission to design the building was given great importance in Bradford and John Ruskin was invited to give his advice.The lecture which Ruskin gave in Bradford has been published, for example, in Unto this last and other writings. Penguin Classics In the lecture, Ruskin famously declared 'I do not care about this Exchange - because you don't'. Ruskin argued that good architecture could only emerge from a pious, paternalistic society and that the Exchange represented the worst form of exploitative capitalism.http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/traffic.html There was a competition to design the building: entries included one from Norman Shaw, but it was won by the local architects Lockwood and Mawson. The foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston. The architectural style employed is Venetian Gothic with some Flemish influence in the tower. Ruskin was dismayed by the use of a Gothic revivalist style in that it imitated the aesthetic but not the spiritual conditions of Medieval society. He had expressed similar displeasure after the construction of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in a Gothic revivalist style in 1861. The accompanying photograph shows the architectural detail of the tower and arcading well, but the light is not strong enough for the contrasting stone colours to emerge. When the building was listed in 1963, the interior of the hall was officially described as follows: > \\"The main hall is still used as a Wool exchange and has finely detailed > lofty hammer-beam roof with wrought iron work decoration. The hall is > surrounded by tall polished granite columns with foliate capitals and there > is an outer south aisle arcade with good naturalistic foliage carving. > Lively wrought ironwork balcony and staircase balustrade.\\" English Heritage > Archive. The \\"good, naturalistic foliage carving\\" and all other architectural carving (except the figures by Tolmie at the entrance) was carved by Mawer and Ingle of Leeds.Leeds Times, Saturday 08 June 1867 p5 col.6: Bradford, Another statue for Peel Park \\"Messrs. Mawer and Ingle, sculptors, Leeds, whose artistic excellencies have been proved in the carvings adorning our new Exchange\\"  Trading practices  Hammerbeam roof interior; now over Waterstones. The trading on the Exchange was by verbal contract only, each party keeping a separate note of the price, quantity and delivery date. Members only (holding tickets authorised by the Committee, usually sponsored by an employing firm) were allowed on the trading floor, but there was a walk around the floor where freelance salesmen and independent traders were allowed to wait in an attempt to catch a member's eye and close a deal \\"off floor\\". \\"Off floor\\" you took your chance on the wool delivered being up to sample; all \\"on floor\\" deals involved the wool being delivered via the conditioning house on Canal Road where the wool was checked for quality (staple length) and dry weight, since adding water was a favourite swindle. To be a member - to \\"have a ticket\\" - was a social distinction in the old wool-trading Bradford.  Spinks' restaurant  Almost as socially important as the Exchange itself was Spinks' restaurant (with its trademark Egyptian sphinx embossed on all the cutlery), which was in a semi-basement below the building. There were two public rooms: the Restaurant, which served a \\"Plated Menu\\", and the Buttery, which served a full \\"Silver Service\\" menu. The menus were almost identical and came from the same kitchen, just the style of service differed. In practice, almost as much trading and networking went on in these two rooms as on the floor upstairs. Since the restaurant was open to the public, not just to members, the place was a centre for Bradford business life in general.  The building today  interior - Wool Exchange, Bradford, now a Waterstones The building has not been used for trading wool since the early 1970s. Waterstones uses the ground floor area for book sales. The best views of the interior are available from the coffee shop on the mezzanine floor. Modern plate-glass windows on this side of the building let in plenty of natural light: something that was lacking in the old days of wool-trading. For more than 15 years, coffeehouse chain Starbucks occupied the space on the mezzanine floor. However, in February 2013, they closed this branch, with Waterstones replacing it with their own 'Caf√© W' brand which opened in March 2013.Call for action after bleak week of shop closures Telegraph & Argus.Former Starbucks above Waterstones reopens as bookshop's own coffee shop Telegraph & Argus. As well as Waterstones and Caf√© W, the building currently hosts a newsagent, pizza restaurant, panini shop, employment agency and the Exchange Ale House. The exterior has sculptures of various heroes of the textile industry such as Joseph Marie Jacquard and also explorers and politicians. The building stands opposite Arndale House, which was built on the site of the Victorian Swan Arcade, the former workplace of J B Priestley which was controversially demolished in 1962.

Bipin Tripathi was a prominent socialist activist, environmentalist and a journalist from Uttarakhand. When he was on a hunger strike with a demand for the establishment of Degree College at Dwarahat, Almora he had lost sizeable weight but was still determined to continue his hunger strike till death or till the accomplishment of his demand. At that time he was working as an Owner Editor of Dronanchal Prahari, a fortnightly paper which he used to publish from Dwarahat. Early life Bipin Tripathi was born on 23 February 1945 in village Dairi of Dwarahat, Almora district to Mathura Datt Tripathi and mother name was Kalawati Devi. He had his Primary and secondary education at Mukteshwar, Nainital district. He passed his Intermediate from Dwarahat and went to Haldwani for pursuing the course of Electrical Diploma. Social and Environmental activism  After he graduated from Kumaon University in 1967 he threw his lot to the cause of the Samajwadi Andolan. He was highly influenced by the thoughts of socialist leader Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia. He fought for the landless villagers of Terai of Nainital district from 1965 to 1969. In 1968-69 he started publication of a fortnightly newspaper Yuvjan Mashal and worked for the achievement of the people‚Äôs demands. He led many public agitations highlighting various demands. In 1970 held the State Level Conference of the Yuvjan Sabha. During this period he was arrested by the state government of Uttar Pradesh for the first time. After his release, he came back to Dwarahat. In 1971 he started his fortnightly paper Dronanchal Prahari. He also fought against the loot of forests by mafias and businessmen like Star Paper Mill, Lalkuan through his paper, with the result that a case was filed against him in the press council. He was among the frontrunner of the forest movement in uttarakhand. In 1974, along with other activists, he opposed forest aution in Nainital and was arrested with other 18 activists, this protest provoked demonstration throughout the region. In 1974 under his leadership, the biggest fight of Chipko movement, for saving Chacharidhar forest, was fought against Saharanpur paper mill, where they successfully saved the forest. In 1975 during Emergency he went to Jail for more than 22 months. Political career Tripathi was a founder member of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal along with Dr. D. D. Pant, Indramani Badoni and Kashi Singh Airy Hari Dutt Bahuguna. The party was founded on 26 July 1979 at Nainital. Tripathi was essentially a democrat, committed to the struggles of the Highlanders of Uttarakhand. He was one of the staunch stalwarts who stood for the establishment of Uttarakhand and he successfully worked for the achievement of this goal. He became a member of the 1st Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the year 2002 in the newly formed Uttarakhand State. He devoted himself for the cause of the development of Uttarakhand. He continued his fight with redoubled vigour and enthusiasm. Death He died on 30 August 2004 at the age 59. At the time of his, he was also the President of the State Unit of the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal. After his death his son Pushpesh Tripathi was elected as MLA from Dwarahat assembly constituency, who is trying to tread the path which his father had shown.

If financial distress cannot be relieved, it can lead to bankruptcy. Financial distress is usually associated with some costs to the company; these are known as costs of financial distress. Cost A common example of a cost of financial distress are bankruptcy costs. These direct costs include auditors' fees, legal fees, management fees and other payments. Cost of financial distress can occur even if bankruptcy is avoided (indirect costs). Financial distress in companies requires management attention and might lead to reduced attention on the operations of the company. Another source of indirect costs of financial distress are higher costs of capital as usually banks increase the interest rates if a state of financial distress occurs. Options for relieving financial distress If high debt burden is the cause of financial distress, the company can undergo a debt restructuring. If operational issues are the reason for the distress, the company can negotiate a payment holiday with its creditors and improve operations to be able to service its debt.

Grey and his party were forced to walk through the area after their boats were lost. On 11 April, Grey discovered and named the Arrowsmith River, after John Arrowsmith the English cartographer. The next Europeans in the area were government Assistant Surveyor Augustus Charles Gregory and Francis Thomas Gregory (both attached to the department of the Surveyor- General) and their brother Henry Churchman Gregory, on a public-private funded expedition to search for new agricultural land beyond the settled areas. They camped at Eneabba Springs, east of Eneabba on 14 September 1846, while returning to Perth from the Irwin River. In 1870 the first settler, William Horsley Rowland, arrived from Greenough. He took up a 3,000 acre lease at Eneabba Springs and survived by shepherding, trapping horses and pigs and living on wild game. The area around Eneabba (also known as the Eneabba sandplain) was opened up for agricultural purposes in the 1950s for a large group of model farms comprising the Eneabba War Service Land Settlement Project. This in turn initiated the need for a town to be developed. The town was gazetted on 27 January 1961. The name of the town means \\"ground spring\\", from the aboriginal name of Eneabba Springs, the site of Rowland's original homestead.

In fault-tolerant design, MTTR is usually considered to also include the time the fault is latent (the time from when the failure occurs until it is detected). If a latent fault goes undetected until an independent failure occurs, the system may not be able to recover. MTTR is often part of a maintenance contract, where a system whose MTTR is 24 hours is generally more valuable than for one of 7 days if mean time between failures is equal, because its Operational Availability is higher. However, in the context of a maintenance contract, it would be important to distinguish whether MTTR is meant to be a measure of the mean time between the point at which the failure is first discovered until the point at which the equipment returns to operation (usually termed \\"mean time to recovery\\"), or only a measure of the elapsed time between the point where repairs actually begin until the point at which the equipment returns to operation (usually termed \\"mean time to repair\\"). For example, a system with a service contract guaranteeing a mean time to \\"repair\\" of 24 hours, but with additional part lead times, administrative delays, and technician transportation delays adding up to a mean of 6 days, would not be any more attractive than another system with a service contract guaranteeing a mean time to \\"recovery\\" of 7 days.

Examples include :\\\\sqrt{5-2\\\\sqrt{5}\\\\ }, which arises in discussing the regular pentagon, and more complicated ones such as :\\\\sqrt[3]{2+\\\\sqrt{3}+\\\\sqrt[3]{4}\\\\ }.  Denesting Some nested radicals can be rewritten in a form that is not nested. For example, :\\\\sqrt{3+2\\\\sqrt{2}} = 1+\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,, :\\\\sqrt{5+2\\\\sqrt{6}} = \\\\sqrt{2}+\\\\sqrt{3}, :\\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} = \\\\frac{1 - \\\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\\\sqrt[3]{9}} \\\\,. Rewriting a nested radical in this way is called denesting. This is not always possible, and, even when possible, it is often difficult. Two nested square roots In the case of two nested square roots, the following theorem completely solves the problem of denesting. If and are rational numbers and is not the square of a rational number, there are two rational numbers and such that :\\\\sqrt{a+\\\\sqrt{c}} = \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{y} if and only if a^2-c~ is the square of a rational number . If the nested radical is real, and are the two numbers :\\\\frac{a+d}2~ and ~\\\\frac{a-d}2~,~ where ~d=\\\\sqrt{a^2-c}~ is a rational number. In particular, if and are integers, then and are integers. This result includes denestings of the form :\\\\sqrt{a+\\\\sqrt{c}}=z\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{y}~, as may always be written z=\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{z^2}, and at least one of the terms must be positive (because the left-hand side of the equation is positive). A more general denesting formula could have the form :\\\\sqrt{a+\\\\sqrt{c}} = \\\\alpha+ \\\\beta\\\\sqrt{x}+\\\\gamma\\\\sqrt{y}+\\\\delta\\\\sqrt x\\\\sqrt y~. However, Galois theory implies that either the left-hand side belongs to \\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt c), or it must be obtained by changing the sign of either \\\\sqrt x, \\\\sqrt y, or both. In the first case, this means that one can take and \\\\gamma=\\\\delta=0. In the second case, \\\\alpha and another coefficient must be zero. If \\\\beta=0, one may rename as for getting \\\\delta=0. Proceeding similarly if \\\\alpha=0, it results that one can suppose \\\\alpha=\\\\delta=0. This shows that the apparently more general denesting can always be reduced to the above one. Proof: By squaring, the equation :\\\\sqrt{a+\\\\sqrt{c}} = \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{y} is equivalent with :a+\\\\sqrt{c}=x+y\\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{xy}, and, in the case of a minus in the right-hand side, :, (square roots are nonnegative by definition of the notation). As the inequality may always be satisfied by possibly exchanging and , solving the first equation in and is equivalent with solving :a+\\\\sqrt{c}=x+y\\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{xy}. This equality implies that \\\\sqrt{xy} belongs to the quadratic field \\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt c). In this field every element may be uniquely written \\\\alpha +\\\\beta\\\\sqrt c, with \\\\alpha and \\\\beta being rational numbers. This implies that \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{xy} is not rational (otherwise the right-hand side of the equation would be rational; but the left-hand side is irrational). As and must be rational, the square of \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{xy} must be rational. This implies that \\\\alpha=0 in the expression of \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{xy} as \\\\alpha +\\\\beta\\\\sqrt c. Thus :a+\\\\sqrt{c}=x+y +\\\\beta\\\\sqrt{c} for some rational number \\\\beta. The uniqueness of the decomposition over and \\\\sqrt c implies thus that the considered equation is equivalent with :a= x+y\\\\quad \\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{xy}=\\\\sqrt c. It follows by Vieta's formulas that and must be roots of the quadratic equation :z^2-az+\\\\frac c4 = 0~; its ~\\\\Delta = a^2-c = d^2 > 0~ (‚â†0, otherwise would be the square of ), hence and must be :\\\\frac{a+\\\\sqrt{a^2-c}}{2}~ and ~\\\\frac{a-\\\\sqrt{a^2-c}}{2}~. Thus and are rational if and only if d=\\\\sqrt{a^2-c}~ is a rational number. For explicitly choosing the various signs, one must consider only positive real square roots, and thus assuming . The equation a^2=c+d^2 shows that . Thus, if the nested radical is real, and if denesting is possible, then . Then, the solution writes :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sqrt{a+\\\\sqrt{c}}&=\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{a+d}2}+\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{a-d}2},\\\\ \\\\sqrt{a-\\\\sqrt{c}}&=\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{a+d}2}-\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{a-d}2}. \\\\end{align}  Some identities of Ramanujan  Srinivasa Ramanujan demonstrated a number of curious identities involving nested radicals. Among them are the following: : \\\\sqrt[4]{\\\\frac{3 + 2 \\\\sqrt[4]{5}}{3 - 2 \\\\sqrt[4]{5}}} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt[4]{5} + 1}{\\\\sqrt[4]{5} - 1}=\\\\tfrac12\\\\left(3+\\\\sqrt[4]5+\\\\sqrt5+\\\\sqrt[4]{125}\\\\right), : \\\\sqrt{ \\\\sqrt[3]{28} - \\\\sqrt[3]{27}} = \\\\tfrac13\\\\left(\\\\sqrt[3]{98} - \\\\sqrt[3]{28} -1\\\\right), : \\\\sqrt[3]{ \\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\frac{32}{5}} - \\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\frac{27}{5}} } = \\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\frac{1}{25}} + \\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\frac{3}{25}} - \\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\frac{9}{25}}, : \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\ \\\\sqrt[3]{2}\\\\ - 1}= \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\frac{1}{9}} - \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\frac{2}{9}} + \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\frac{4}{9}}. Other odd-looking radicals inspired by Ramanujan include: : \\\\sqrt[4]{49 + 20\\\\sqrt{6}} + \\\\sqrt[4]{49 - 20\\\\sqrt{6}} = 2\\\\sqrt{3}, : \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{2}+ \\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right)\\\\left(5 - \\\\sqrt{6}\\\\right) + 3\\\\left(2\\\\sqrt{3} + 3\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\right)} = \\\\sqrt{10 - \\\\frac{13 - 5\\\\sqrt{6}}{5 + \\\\sqrt{6}}}.  Landau's algorithm  In 1989 Susan Landau introduced the first algorithm for deciding which nested radicals can be denested. Earlier algorithms worked in some cases but not others. In trigonometry In trigonometry, the sines and cosines of many angles can be expressed in terms of nested radicals. For example, : \\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{60}=\\\\sin 3^\\\\circ=\\\\frac{1}{16} \\\\left[2(1-\\\\sqrt3)\\\\sqrt{5+\\\\sqrt5}+\\\\sqrt2(\\\\sqrt5-1)(\\\\sqrt3+1)\\\\right] and : \\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{24}=\\\\sin 7.5^\\\\circ=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{2-\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt3}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{2 - \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt3}{\\\\sqrt2}} . The last equality results directly from the results of . In the solution of the cubic equation Nested radicals appear in the algebraic solution of the cubic equation. Any cubic equation can be written in simplified form without a quadratic term, as :x^3+px+q=0, whose general solution for one of the roots is : x=\\\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\\\over 2}+ \\\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\\\over 27}}} +\\\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\\\over 2}- \\\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\\\over 27}}}. In the case in which the cubic has only one real root, the real root is given by this expression with the radicands of the cube roots being real and with the cube roots being the real cube roots. In the case of three real roots, the square root expression is an imaginary number; here any real root is expressed by defining the first cube root to be any specific complex cube root of the complex radicand, and by defining the second cube root to be the complex conjugate of the first one. The nested radicals in this solution cannot in general be simplified unless the cubic equation has at least one rational solution. Indeed, if the cubic has three irrational but real solutions, we have the casus irreducibilis, in which all three real solutions are written in terms of cube roots of complex numbers. On the other hand, consider the equation :x^3-7x+6=0, which has the rational solutions 1, 2, and ‚àí3. The general solution formula given above gives the solutions :x=\\\\sqrt[3]{-3+\\\\frac{10\\\\sqrt{3}i}{9}} + \\\\sqrt[3]{-3-\\\\frac{10\\\\sqrt{3}i}{9}} . For any given choice of cube root and its conjugate, this contains nested radicals involving complex numbers, yet it is reducible (even though not obviously so) to one of the solutions 1, 2, or ‚Äì3.  Infinitely nested radicals  = Square roots = Under certain conditions infinitely nested square roots such as : x = \\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\cdots}}}} represent rational numbers. This rational number can be found by realizing that x also appears under the radical sign, which gives the equation : x = \\\\sqrt{2+x}. If we solve this equation, we find that x = 2 (the second solution x = ‚àí1 doesn't apply, under the convention that the positive square root is meant). This approach can also be used to show that generally, if n > 0, then : \\\\sqrt{n+\\\\sqrt{n+\\\\sqrt{n+\\\\sqrt{n+\\\\cdots}}}} = \\\\tfrac12\\\\left(1 + \\\\sqrt {1+4n}\\\\right) and is the positive root of the equation x2 ‚àí x ‚àí n = 0\\\\. For n = 1, this root is the golden ratio œÜ, approximately equal to 1.618. The same procedure also works to obtain, if n > 1, : \\\\sqrt{n-\\\\sqrt{n-\\\\sqrt{n-\\\\sqrt{n-\\\\cdots}}}} = \\\\tfrac12\\\\left(-1 + \\\\sqrt {1+4n}\\\\right), which is the positive root of the equation x2 + x ‚àí n = 0\\\\. Ramanujan's infinite radicals Ramanujan posed the following problem to the Journal of Indian Mathematical Society: : ? = \\\\sqrt{1+2\\\\sqrt{1+3 \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\cdots}}}. This can be solved by noting a more general formulation: : ? = \\\\sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{\\\\cdots}}}}. Setting this to F(x) and squaring both sides gives us : F(x)^2 = ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{\\\\cdots}}}, which can be simplified to : F(x)^2 = ax+(n+a)^2 +xF(x+n) . It can then be shown that : F(x) = {x + n + a}. So, setting a = 0, n = 1, and x = 2, we have : 3 = \\\\sqrt{1+2\\\\sqrt{1+3 \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\cdots}}}. Ramanujan stated the following infinite radical denesting in his lost notebook: :\\\\sqrt{5+\\\\sqrt{5+\\\\sqrt{5-\\\\sqrt{5+\\\\sqrt{5+\\\\sqrt{5-\\\\sqrt{5+\\\\cdots}}}}}}}=\\\\frac{2+\\\\sqrt{5}+\\\\sqrt{15-6\\\\sqrt{5}}}{2}. The repeating pattern of the signs is (+,+,-). Vi√®te's expression for  Vi√®te's formula for , the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is :\\\\frac2\\\\pi= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt2}2\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt2}}2\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt{2+\\\\sqrt2}}}2\\\\cdots. = Cube roots = In certain cases, infinitely nested cube roots such as : x = \\\\sqrt[3]{6+\\\\sqrt[3]{6+\\\\sqrt[3]{6+\\\\sqrt[3]{6+\\\\cdots}}}} can represent rational numbers as well. Again, by realizing that the whole expression appears inside itself, we are left with the equation : x = \\\\sqrt[3]{6+x}. If we solve this equation, we find that x = 2\\\\. More generally, we find that : \\\\sqrt[3]{n+\\\\sqrt[3]{n+\\\\sqrt[3]{n+\\\\sqrt[3]{n+\\\\cdots}}}} is the positive real root of the equation x3 ‚àí x ‚àí n = 0 for all n > 0\\\\. For n = 1, this root is the plastic number œÅ, approximately equal to 1.3247. The same procedure also works to get : \\\\sqrt[3]{n-\\\\sqrt[3]{n-\\\\sqrt[3]{n-\\\\sqrt[3]{n-\\\\cdots}}}} as the real root of the equation x3 + x ‚àí n = 0 for all n > 1\\\\. = Herschfeld's Convergence Theorem= An infinitely nested radical \\\\sqrt{a_1 + \\\\sqrt{a_2 + \\\\dotsb}} (where all a_i are nonnegative) converges if and only if there is some M \\\\in \\\\mathbb R such that M \\\\geq a_n^{2^{-n}} for all n.

Moreover, the sequence \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{a_1 + \\\\sqrt{a_2 + \\\\dotsc \\\\sqrt{a_n}}}\\\\right) is monotonically increasing. Therefore it converges, by the monotone convergence theorem.  Proof of \\"only if\\"  If the sequence \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{a_1 + \\\\sqrt{a_2 + \\\\dotsc \\\\sqrt{a_n}}}\\\\right) converges, then it is bounded.

The space separates two of the meninges, the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. These cisterns are filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Structure Although the pia mater adheres to the surface of the brain, closely following the contours of its gyri and sulci, the arachnoid mater only covers its superficial surface, bridging across the gyri. This leaves wider spaces between the pia and arachnoid and the cavities are known as the subarachnoid cisterns. Although they are often described as distinct compartments, the subarachnoid cisterns are not truly anatomically distinct. Rather, these subarachnoid cisterns are separated from each other by a trabeculated porous wall with various-sized openings. Cisterns There are many cisterns in the brain with several large ones noted with their own name. At the base of the spinal cord is another subarachnoid cistern: the lumbar cistern which is the site for a lumbar puncture. Some major subarachnoid cisterns: * Cisterna magna also called cerebellomedullary cistern - the largest of the subarachnoid cisterns. It lies between the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata. It receives CSF from the fourth ventricle via the median aperture (foramen of Magendie). The cisterna magna contains: # The vertebral artery and the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) # The ninth (IX), tenth (X), eleventh (XI) and twelfth (XII) cranial nerves * Pontine cistern. Surrounds the ventral aspect of the pons. It receives CSF via the paired lateral apertures. It contains: # The basilar artery and the origin of the anteroinferior cerebellar artery (AICA) # The origin of the superior cerebellar arteries # The sixth (VI) cranial nerve * Interpeduncular cistern. It is situated at the base of the brain, between the two cerebral peduncles of midbrain and dorsum sellae and continuous below with the pontine cistern and superiorly with the chiasmatic cistern. It contains: # The optic chiasm # The bifurcation of the basilar artery # Peduncular segments of the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) # Peduncular segments of the superior cerebellar arteries # Perforating branches of the PCA # The posterior communicating arteries (PCoA) # The basal vein # The third (III) cranial nerve, which passes between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries * Cerebellopontine angle cistern. It is situated at the cerebellopontine angle ‚Äì the lateral angle between the cerebellum and the pons. It contains: # The seventh (VII) and eighth (VIII) cranial nerves # The anteroinferior cerebellar artery (AICA) # The fifth (V) cranial nerve and the petrosal vein * Superior cistern - It is situated dorsal to the midbrain. Thin, sheet-like extensions of the superior cistern that extend laterally about the midbrain, connecting it to the interpeduncular cistern. Ambient cistern may also refer to the combination of these extensions and the superior cistern. It is composed of a supratentorial and an infratentorial compartment. It contains: # The great cerebral vein # The posterior pericallosal arteries # The third portion of the superior cerebellar arteries # Perforating branches of the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries # The third portion of the posterior cerebral arteries : Its supratentorial portion contains: # The basal vein # The posterior cerebral artery : Its infratentorial portion contains: # The superior cerebellar artery # The fourth (IV) nerve * Crural cistern. It is situated around the ventrolateral aspect of the midbrain. It contains: # The anterior choroidal artery # The medial posterior choroidal artery # The basal vein * Carotid cistern. It is situated between the carotid artery and the ipsilateral optic nerve. It contains: # The internal carotid artery # The origin of the anterior choroidal artery # The origin of the posterior communicating artery * Insular/Sylvian cistern. It is situated in the fissure between the frontal and temporal lobes. It contains: # The middle cerebral artery # The middle cerebral veins # The fronto-orbital veins # Collaterals to the basal vein * Cistern of lamina terminalis. It is situated just rostral to the third ventricle.

Along with James Paris Lee, Mannlicher was particularly noted for inventing the en-bloc clip charger- loading magazine system. Later, while making improvements to other inventors prototype designs for rotary-feed magazines, Mannlicher, together with his prot√©g√© Otto Sch√∂nauer, patented a perfected rotary magazine design, the Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer, which was a commercial and military success. Life A scion of a long-established bourgeois family descending from Most () in Bohemia, Mannlicher was born in the German city of Mainz, where his father served as a k.k. official in the Austrian garrison at the Confederation Fortress. He returned to the Josefstadt district of Vienna with his parents in 1857, and after receiving his Matura high-school exam attended the Vienna University of Technology. He started his professional career in 1869 as an employee of the Austrian Southern Railway company and worked as an engineer at the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway company until 1887. Mannlicher had early turned his interest to weapons technology, particularly breech-loading repeating rifles. His ambitions were fueled by the Austrian defeat in the 1866 Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz, which he traced back to the inadequate equipment of the Imperial and Royal Army. In 1876 he travelled to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia to study numerous construction designs and afterwards drafted several types of repeating rifles with tubular magazines. In 1885-1886 he patented the \\"Mannlicher System\\" of a breechblock on a bolt action basis, which was adopted as a service rifle by the Austro-Hungarian Army and several other armed forces. Mannlicher joined the Austrian Arms Factory company at Steyr in Upper Austria, which under the name of Steyr Mannlicher soon became one of the largest weapon manufacturers in Europe. The model Mannlicher M1895 was widely used by the Austro-Hungarian Army up to World War I. In 1887 Mannlicher was awarded the 3rd class of the Order of the Iron Crown (Austria), he also received the Prussian Order of the Crown and the officier medal of the French Legion of Honour. On 14 December 1892 Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria vested him with the title of Ritter von (loosely translated to: 'knight of') due to his earlier ennoblement. In 1899 he was given a lifelong appointment to the Austrian Upper House (√ñsterreichisches Herrenhaus) of the Imperial Council parliament. Mannlicher's successful designs during his lifetime were his bolt- action rifles, both military and sporting, in both turn bolt and straight-pull actions. Mannlicher also developed several innovative semi-automatic handgun designs in the last decade of the 19th century. A measure of how far ahead of his time he was can be seen by looking at his experimental designs of semiautomatic rifles, developed at a time when ammunition was not suitable to function properly in such a weapon. Mannlicher began development in 1883 of an automatic rifle firing the 11mm Austrian Werndl, a black powder cartridge.Walter H. B. Smith, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Military Service Publishing Co., 1947, pp. 155‚Äì62 According to WHB Smith in \\"Mauser, Walther and Mannlicher Firearms\\" the Mannlicher 1885 became the inspiration for the M1 Garand and the Mannlicher 1900 with the 'short-stroke piston' became the inspiration for the M1 Carbine. Mannlicher's automatic rifle designs Mannlicher introduced several automatic rifle designs that were unsuccessful, but ahead of their time. He introduced fundamental principles that were used by later designers, often successfully. Mannlicher's Model 85 semi automatic rifle used his recoil operated action originally developed in 1883; it anticipated the recoiling barrel system used later in designs like the German MG 34 and MG 42 machineguns, and the M1941 Johnson machine gun. The Model 85 would have fit the same tactical role as the American BAR or British Bren of World War II fame. The Model 91 semi-automatic rifle was designed to use the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge and the Model 88 rifle clip. Like the Model 85 it was a recoil operated action like the later Remington Model 8 and M1941 Johnson rifle. Mannlicher designed two semi-automatic rifles both called Model 93, one based on his turn-bolt rifle and the other based on his straight-pull rifle. The rifles had a recoil spring housing behind the bolt and the bolt locking lugs were angled, so the bolt started turning on firing, essentially a hesitation lock or delayed blowback much like the later Thompson Autorifle utilising the Blish lock. In this system there was no recoiling barrel nor gas piston as with other rifle-caliber autoloading designs, so the mechanism was simple, but ejection of fired cartridge casings was so fierce as to be hazardous to bystanders. The Model 95 semi-automatic rifle was gas operated using a slide with the cocking handle on its side and gas piston at its front to operate the bolt, with the recoil spring operating on the slide. Loading was with the Mannlicher packet clip of cartridges inserted into the magazine from the top. These features were also used in the later U.S. M1 Garand rifle. The Model 1900 semi-automatic rifle was also gas operated but used a short stroke piston with a camming lug that engaged the bolt to open it. The bolt was then carried to the rear by momentum with the recoil spring operating on the bolt. The US M1 carbine used a short stroke piston to impart momentum to a slide that opened the bolt, combining features introduced in the Mannlicher Model 95 and Model 100.Walter H. B. Smith, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Military Service Publishing Co. 1947. Model 85 pp. 155‚Äì62; Model 91 pp. 163‚Äì69; Model 93 turning bolt pp. 170‚Äì77; Model 93 straight-pull pp. 178‚Äì84; Model 95 pp. 197‚Äì203; Model 1900 pp. 232‚Äì39. The Model 1905 used a short recoil action with a tilting locking block. This was same principle Mannlicher used in his 1901 pistol-caliber carbine. However, for the rifle he scaled it up to 8mm Mauser, the standard German military rifle cartridge. The rifle also used a Sch√∂nauer rotary magazine, and sights copied from the Mauser Gewehr 98. Although his company patented the design in 1905, Mannlicher's death in 1904 ended any further development of the design.

The riot ended with minimal casualties.  Riot  In the early 18th century, the city of Boston had very little arable land, and most grain had to be imported from surrounding areas or from abroad. It was common practice for the larger local grain merchants to hoard grain to drive up local prices, and to sell local grain in more lucrative foreign markets such as Europe or the sugar plantations of the West Indies. On top of this, Queen Anne's War (1702‚Äì1713) interfered with foreign trade. By 1709, Boston was experiencing a serious food shortage and skyrocketing bread prices. The hardest hit were the working poor. Since they did not own land, and were therefore not allowed to vote, governmental indifference to their needs left violence as the only effective recourse. A percentage of the poor began an uprising against the government. In April 1710, a group of men broke the rudder of a cargo ship belonging to merchant Andrew Belcher, to stop its cargo of wheat from being shipped away and sold abroad. The next day, about 50 men attempted to force the ship's captain ashore, intending to loot the ship of its grain. They were arrested, but popular support for their cause resulted in them being released without charges. In October 1711, a fire in Boston left over 100 families homeless, leading to a second riot. In May 1713, a mob of more than 200 rioted on Boston Common, protesting high bread prices. As well as attacking Belcher's ships, the mob \\"broke into his warehouses looking for corn, and shot the lieutenant governor when he tried to interfere.\\"Zinn, Howard. _A People's History of the United States_. 1st Harper Perennial edition, HarperCollins. New York, NY. 1995, p. 51  Results  After the Boston Bread Riot, acts were passed prohibiting exports of grain in time of shortage, fixing grain and bread prices at more reasonable levels, and establishing a public granary. These measures somewhat alleviated the immediate shortage; however, food shortages and the attendant rioting and looting recurred in Boston throughout the American Revolution and into the early 19th century.

Structure The cerebellar tentorium is an arched lamina, elevated in the middle, and inclining downward toward the circumference. It covers the top of the cerebellum, and supports the occipital lobes of the brain. Its anterior border is free and concave, and bounds a large oval opening, the tentorial incisure, through which pass the cerebral peduncles. It is attached, behind, by its convex border, to the transverse ridges upon the inner surface of the occipital bone, and there encloses the transverse sinuses; in front, to the superior angle of the petrous part of the temporal bone on either side, enclosing the superior petrosal sinuses. At the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone the free and attached borders meet, and, crossing one another, are continued forward to be fixed to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes (respectively) of the sphenoid bone. To the middle line of its upper surface the posterior border of the falx cerebri is attached, the straight sinus being placed at their line of junction. Clinical significance Brain tumors are often characterized as supratentorial (above the tentorium) and infratentorial (below the tentorium). The location of the tumor can help in determining the type of tumor, as different tumors occur with different frequencies at each location. Additionally, most childhood primary brain tumors are infratentorial, while most adult primary brain tumors are supratentorial. The location of the tumor may have prognostic significance as well. Since the tentorium is a hard structure, if there is an expansion of the volume of the brain or its surrounding matter above the tentorium, such as because of a tumour or bleeding, the brain can get pushed down partly through the tentorium. This is called herniation and will often cause an enlarged pupil on the affected side, due to pressure on the oculomotor nerve. Tentorial herniation is a serious symptom, especially since the brainstem is likely to be compressed as well if the intracranial pressure rises further. A common type of herniation is uncal herniation. Calcifications within the cerebellar tentorium are relatively common in elderly people; they seem to rarely cause symptoms.https://radiopaedia.org/articles/normal-intracranial-calcifications; retrieved 04-07-2018 Additional images File:Falxcerebri.jpgDura mater and its processes exposed by removing part of the right half of the skull, and the brain.

Located between Ayer Rajah Avenue and Portsdown Road underneath Fusionopolis Place within one-north, this is the only MRT station to have a name that starts with an uncapitalised letter and includes a hyphen. The station takes its name from the one-north business park, a reference to Singapore's latitude being (slightly over) one degree north of the equator. The station is nestled within the basement of Fusionopolis, a research and development complex comprising retail outlets and serviced apartments. History As part of the survey, one-north was originally named 'Portsdown'. The options involve 'one-north', 'Portsdown' and 'Ayer Rajah'. In the end, one-north was selected in January 2006. Construction began on 12 March that year. The station was opened on 8 October 2011, along with Stages 4 and 5 of the Circle line. The significance of the name one-north is probably from the fact that Singapore is one-degree to the north of the equator, and also for the fact that the station is close to many Quaternary Industries like Biopolis and Fusionopolis. In addition, it is located between Portsdown Road (bus service 191) and Ayer Rajah Avenue (bus service 91), but it is not near to Mediapolis.

The MCA arises from the internal carotid and continues into the lateral sulcus where it then branches and projects to many parts of the lateral cerebral cortex. It also supplies blood to the anterior temporal lobes and the insular cortices. The left and right MCAs rise from trifurcations of the internal carotid arteries and thus are connected to the anterior cerebral arteries and the posterior communicating arteries, which connect to the posterior cerebral arteries. The MCAs are not considered a part of the Circle of Willis.Moore KL, Dalley AR. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 4th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Toronto. Copyright 1999. . Structure Middle cerebral artery Middle cerebral artery and its branches (patient has a hypoplastic A1 segment and an absent PCOM, resulting in a purely MCA angio from internal carotid artery injection) The middle cerebral artery can be classified into 4 parts: *M1: The sphenoidal segment (stem)http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Neuro/neurovasc/navigation/mca.htm, so named due to its origin and loose lateral tracking of the sphenoid bone. Although known also as the horizontal segment, this may be misleading since the segment may descend, remain flat, or extend posteriorly the anterior (dorsad) in different individuals. The M1 segment perforates the brain with numerous anterolateral central (lateral lenticulostriate) arteries, which irrigate the basal ganglia. *M2: Extending anteriorly on the insula, this segment is known as the insular segment. It is also known as the Sylvian segment when the opercular segments are included. The MCA branches may bifurcate or sometimes trifurcate into trunks in this segment which then extend into branches that terminate towards the cortex. *M3: The opercular segments and extends laterally exteriorly from the insula towards the cortex. This segment is sometimes grouped as part of M2. *M4: These finer terminal or cortical segments irrigate the cortex. They begin at the external margins of the Sylvian fissure and extend distally away on the cortex of the brain. The M2 and M3 segments may each split into 2 or 3 main trunks (terminal branches) with an upper trunk, lower trunk and occasionally a middle trunk. Bifurcations and trifurcations occurs in 50% and 25% of the cases respectively. Other cases include duplication of the MCA at the internal carotid artery (ICA) or an accessory MCA (AccMCA) which arise not from the ICA but as a branch from the anterior cerebral artery. The middle trunk that exist in parts of the population, when present provides the pre-Rolandic, Rolandic, anterior parietal, posterior parietal and the angular artery for irrigation instead of the upper and lower trunks. The branches (ramus) of the MCA can be described by the areas that they irrigate. =Frontal lobe= *Lateral frontobasal (orbitiofrontal): This artery branches out anteriorly, superiorly and laterally to vascularize the inferior frontal gyrus. It \\"competes\\" in size with the frontal polar branch of the anterior cerebral artery *Prefrontal arteries: These arteries fan out over the insula and exit to the cortex via the medial surface of the frontal operculum. The arteries fan superiorly over the pars triangularis and vascularize the inferior and middle frontal gyrus. Near the superior frontal gyrus these arteries anastomose with branches from the pericallosal artery of the anterior cerebral artery. *Pre-Rolandic artery (precentral): The artery extends out on the medial surface of the operculum and supplies the posterior parts of the middle and inferior frontal gyri as well as the lower parts of the pre-central gyrus. This artery branches once or twice and is relatively invariant across anatomies. *Rolandic arteries (central): The artery extends out and exits from the central portion of the operculum then passes inside the central sulcus. This artery bifurcates in 72% of individuals and irrigates the posterior pre-central gyrus and the inferior portion of the post-central gyrus. =Parietal lobe= *Anterior parietal: This artery usually originates from the anterior or middle MCA trunk. In some cases it branches from the rolandic artery or from the posterior parietal artery. It extends the length of interparietal sulcus and descends slightly posteriorly. *Posterior parietal: Emerges from the posterior end of the Sylvian fissure and extends first posteriorly, and then anteriorly along the posterior of the parietal lobe. It also branches to the supramarginal gyrus. *Angular: The angular artery is a significant terminal branch of the anterior or middle trunk of the MCA. It emerges from the Sylvian fissure and passes over the anterior transverse temporal gyrus and usually divides into two branches. One of the branches supplies the angular gyrus while the other supplies the supramarginal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, and the parietooccipital arcus (sulcus). *Temporooccipital: The longest cortical artery, it runs posteriorly opposite to the center of the operculum. Upon its exit from the Sylvian fissure, it runs parallel to the superior temporal sulcus and supplies the superior and inferior occipital gyri. This vessel anastamoses with the posterior cerebral artery and may exist as one or two arteries, 67% or 33% of the time, respectively. =Temporal lobe= *Temporopolar: The artery extends from the sphenoidal segment of the MCA via the inferior surface of the operculum and supplies the polar and anterior lateral portions of the temporal lobe. The vessel can be identified in 52% of normal angiograms *Anterior temporal: This artery extends in the similar fashion as the temporopolar artery and vascularizes the same regions. *Middle temporal: This artery extends from the Sylvian fissure opposite to the inferior frontal gyrus and supplies superior and middle portions of the middle temporal lobe. It can be identified in 79% of angiograms. *Posterior temporal: This artery extends out and away from the operculum and turns in a step-wise manner first inferiorly then posteriorly into the superior temporal sulcus then to the middle temporal sulcus. This vessel supplies posterior portion of the temporal lobe and is the origin of several perforating arteries that irrigate the insula. It is readily identifiable in most radiograms. Function Areas supplied by the middle cerebral artery include: * The bulk of the lateral surface of the hemisphere; except for the superior inch of the frontal and parietal lobe (anterior cerebral artery), and the inferior part of the temporal lobe. *Superior division supplies lateroinferior frontal lobe (location of Broca's area i.e. language expression) *Inferior division supplies lateral temporal lobe (location of Wernicke's area i.e. language comprehension) *Deep branches supply the basal ganglia as well as the internal capsule MCA occlusion site and resulting Aphasia *Global ‚Äì trunk of MCA *Broca ‚Äì anterior branch of MCA *Wernicke ‚Äì posterior branch of MCA Clinical significance =Occlusion= Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery results in Middle cerebral artery syndrome, potentially showing the following defects: # Paralysis (-plegia) or weakness (-paresis) of the contralateral face and arm (faciobrachial) # Sensory loss of the contralateral face and arm. # Damage to the dominant hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere) results in aphasia i.e. Broca's area or Wernicke's # Damage to the non-dominant hemisphere (usually the right hemisphere) results in contralateral neglect syndrome # Large MCA infarcts often have d√©viation conjugu√©e, a gaze preference towards the side of the lesion, especially during the acute period.

He married a local woman and got two sons, Pierus and Amathus; two cities, Pieria and Amathia in Macedonia were founded or named after them\\". The rare name of his mother Thyia, has been corrupted in transmission to Aithria or Aithyia through the phrase \\"kai Thyias, and Thyia\\".

Hammond, based on the passage of Hellanicus, as well on the Thessalian Magnes being brother of Macedon, suggested that the Macedonian language is an Aeolic Greek dialect.Alexander the Great: a reader By Ian Worthington Page 20 (2003) Jonathan M.

(see also Osiris-Dionysus deity). Diodorus relates:Diodorus 1.18. Translation by Charles Henry Oldfather. Read the whole passage in translation by Edwin Murphy ‚ÄúNow Osiris was accompanied on his campaign, as the Egyptian account goes, by his two sons Anubis and Macedon, who were distinguished for their valour. Both of them carried the most notable accoutrements of war, taken from certain animals whose character was not unlike the boldness of the men, Anubis wearing a dog‚Äòs skin and Macedon the fore-parts of a wolf; and it is for this reason that these animals are held in honour among the Egyptians. Macedon his son, moreover, he left as king of Macedonia, which was named after him.‚Äù Makedon has taken the place of the Egyptian wolf-god of Lycopolis, WepwawetBurton, Anne.

In one instance Wepwawet also appears as the son of Osiris: \\"I am Wepwawet, the heir of Senwy, the son of Osiris.\\" and in later traditions Makedon is mentioned as a son of the were-wolf Lycaon. =Son of Lycaon= According to Apollodorus,Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 3.96. but not present in the list of Pausanias or Hyginus, Macednus is the tenth of the fifty sons of Lycaon king of Arcadia. The closest brother to him by region is Thesprotus. In the story of Pindus and the Serpent by Claudius Aelianus, Makedon is the son of Lycaon king of Emathia, \\"after whom the land was called Macedonia no longer preserving its ancient name\\". Eustathius, summarizing the genealogies, relates: \\"Emathion son of Zeus and Electra preceding the birth of Makedon son of Aeacus\\" (instead of Lycaon).A History of Macedonia: 550-336 B.C By Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri√®re Hammond, Guy Thompson Griffith v. 2 (1979) Page 39 Strabo just called him archaios hegemonStrabo, VII, fr.11 (old chieftain), and Pseudo-Scymnus,Periegesis 620 g√™gen√™s basileus (earth-born king).

Finally, in the version of Lycaon king of Emathia, Pindus is a son of Makedon, who gave his name to Pindus, where he died, a river of Doris, a region in central Greece. It is unclear whether these localities represent pre- or post- Macedonian elements, since Emathia and Pieria are older toponyms than Macedonia. Anachronism is not infrequent in later mythic traditions. (Cf. Boeotus, reported as father of autochthon Ogyges) Name =Classical form= In Greek sources, the noun is mostly attested as (Maked√¥n) with two exceptions: the poetic form (Mak√™d√¥n) in Hesiod with long medial vowel serving the metrical feet of dactylic hexameter and (M√°kednos) or latinicized Macednus with barytonesis and apophony in Apollodorus. The recessive accent is reminiscent of two Macedonian barytonized personal names, (Ko√Ænos) and (B√°lakros) (Attic/Greek adjectives:koin√≥s, phalakr√≥s), but whether Maked√¥n or M√°kednos is the original spelling presumably cannot be proven. Moreover, the suffix -dnos, either as the \\"Dorian Makedn√≥n ethnos\\" of Herodotus or makedn√≥s, a rare poetic epithet denoting tall, seems not to be attested in epigraphy, or used by Macedonians themselves. In Latin sources the noun is Macedo. As adjectives the Latin Macedo and Greek (Maked√¥n) denote foremost a Macedonian man. They also appear, mostly during the Roman era, as personal male names (cf.Macedonius) See also *Macedonia (ancient kingdom) *Ancient Macedonians *Ancient Greece *Hellen *Vergina Sun *Kings of Macedon References Category:Deucalionids Category:Kings in Greek mythology Category:Mythology of Macedonia (ancient kingdom) Category:Children of Zeus ","title":"Makedon (mythology)"},{"id":"2503762","text":"Claude Aubrey Akins (May 25, 1926 ‚Äì January 27, 1994) was an American character actor with a long career on stage, screen, and television. He was best known as Sheriff Lobo on the 1979‚Äì1981 television series B. J. and the Bear, and later The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo, a spin-off series. Early years Akins was born in Nelson, Georgia, and grew up in Bedford, Indiana, the son of Maude and Ernest Akins. Film reference works said he was born in 1918, making his age at death 75; however, Akins' son said his father was 67 at the time of his death, and he is listed as Aubrey Akins in the 1940 Census, age 13. He served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps in World War II in Burma and the Philippines. After the war, he graduated in 1949 from Northwestern University, where he had majored in theatre and became a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Film career As a film actor, Akins first appeared in From Here to Eternity (1953). He appeared as a seaman and shipmate of Lee Marvin's in The Caine Mutiny (1954). He portrayed prisoner Joe Burdette in Rio Bravo (starring John Wayne, Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin, and Angie Dickinson), Naval Lt. Commander Farber in Don't Give Up the Ship (starring Jerry Lewis), Sgt Kolowicz in Merrill's Marauders, Rockwell W. \\"Rocky\\" Rockman in The Devil's Brigade, the Reverend Jeremiah Brown in the movie Inherit the Wind (1960), outlaw Ben Lane in Comanche Station that same year, Seely Jones in A Distant Trumpet (1964), and the gorilla leader Aldo in Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973), the last original Apes movie. He had a small part in The Sea Chase with John Wayne. He appeared with Yul Brynner and Robert Fuller in the film Return of the Seven (1966) (also called Return of the Magnificent Seven and The Magnificent Seven 2), and also appeared in the movie Seasons of the Heart (1993). Television Akins was cast in a large number of television series, including The Adventures of Superman (episode number 69, \\"Peril by Sea\\"), in which he plays a villainous conspirator, Crusader, and I Love Lucy in which he portrays himself. Much of his work was on Westerns, including Frontier, My Friend Flicka (three times), Boots and Saddles, Northwest Passage, The Restless Gun (four times), Sheriff of Cochise, Wagon Train (four times), Overland Trail, Frontier Circus, The Tall Man, The Rebel, The Big Valley, Daniel Boone, The Legend of Jesse James, Death Valley Days, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre (four times), The Rifleman (three times), Rawhide (seven times), Gunsmoke (10 times), Bonanza (four times), The Alaskans (twice) and The Texan (twice). He appeared once on Richard Diamond, Private Detective, Empire, Laredo (\\"The Treasure of San Diablo\\"), the syndicated series, Pony Express (in \\"The Story of Julesburg\\" with Sebastian Cabot and James Best), and The Oregon Trail, with Rod Taylor. He was cast as Jarret Sutton in \\"Escape to Memphis\\" (1959) and as Beaudry Rawlins in \\"Duel on the River\\" (1960) on Darren McGavin's NBC series, Riverboat. Akins played a rodeo clown convicted of armed robbery in \\"Killer on Horseback\\", an episode of the NBC anthology series Star Stage, which became the pilot episode for the syndicated police drama State Trooper, starring Rod Cameron. The episode was later broadcast on the regular series as \\"Rodeo Rough House\\". Beverly Garland also appeared in the episode as Nellie Austin, a sharpshooter. Akins and Garland much later appeared together in the 1963 episode \\"The Chooser of the Slain\\" on the ABC/Warner Bros. Western series, The Dakotas. Among Akins' four appearances on NBC's Laramie with series stars John Smith and Robert Fuller was the role of former Sheriff Jim Dark in the episode \\"Queen of Diamonds\\" (September 20, 1960), with Julie London as Dark's estranged wife, a card dealer using the name \\"June Brown\\". Dark had foiled a robbery by the Reeves brothers, one of whom was killed, but his right hand was severely injured, and he could no longer handle a gun. June avoided her husband for his own protection when the outlaw brothers pursued them. Clem Reeves was portrayed by Tony Young, later cast as \\"Cord\\" in the short-lived Gunslinger series on CBS. Ultimately, the gang was captured, and the Darks were reconciled, leaving Laramie by stagecoach. Akins was featured in In the Heat of the Night, and two episodes of the original CBS series The Twilight Zone (\\"The Little People\\" and \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\"). He also guest-starred in three episodes each of Combat! (fourth and fifth seasons) and The Untouchables. He appeared on Rod Cameron's early syndicated series, City Detective, Meet McGraw with Frank Lovejoy, the ABC/WB drama, The Roaring 20's, and Police Story. Akins' other early appearances included a role as a policeman on Alfred Hitchcock Presents in \\"Place of Shadows\\" (1956) and \\"Reward to Finder\\" (1957).

In 1965, Akins played El Supremo in \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" episode, \\"The Very Important Zombie Affair\\". In 1967, Akins played Lt. Finch in The Lucy Show episode, \\"Lucy Meets the Law\\", as he interrogates Lucy as a grand larceny suspect. Lucy is eventually cleared of the crime when the actual redhead confesses to it.

Dr. Kirk's sister Lucrezia was played by Barbara Eden. He played a kidnapper in a 1964 episode of The Fugitive. In 1965, he was featured in an episode of Kraft Suspense Theatre, playing a German infiltrator who went unsuspected. Also that year, Akins gave a memorable performance as the head of an Irish immigrant family in The Big Valley (\\"The Brawlers\\"). Claude Akins had an earlier role in the first season of Barnaby Jones; episode titled \\"Murder Go-Round\\". Before his signature character Sheriff Lobo, Akins appeared as owner-operator trucker Sonny Pruitt in NBC's Movin' On, from 1974‚Äì76, with Frank Converse. Akins starred in over 40 episodes of Movin' On, plus a made- for-TV movie \\"In Tandem\\". He also starred as a Nashville police detective, named Stoney Huff, in a short-lived, hour-long crime drama (cancelled after four episodes) in April 1977 called Nashville 99. Akins' best-known role of Sheriff Elroy P. Lobo had begun as a recurring character on the television series B.J. and the Bear. After becoming a recognizable name in the late 1970s, Akins did testimonial TV commercials for PoliGrip, Rollins Truck Leasing, and AAMCO Transmissions. Akins found work in the late 1980s lending his voice talents to the work safety instructional video series, Safety Shorts, in which he expounded the virtues of workplace safety to thousands of industrial employees, offering lessons on the importance of lockout/tagout procedures, personal protective equipment, and the MSDS documentation process. Akins made a golfing video with Ron Masak, entitled Tom Kite and Friends. Death Akins died of stomach cancer in Pasadena, California. Legacy The Claude Akins Memorial Golf Classic, a six-person scramble-format golf tournament, takes place at Otis Park Golf Course in Bedford, Indiana, in August or September of each year. Proceeds from the event go to the Akins Scholarship and the Bedford Recreation Foundation Scholarship, given every year to a graduating senior at Bedford North Lawrence High School, as well as many projects involving recreation and improvements.

It is located in the Rhubarb Triangle. History Although earlier remains, such as Roman coins and pottery, have been found in the area, the current settlement dates from after the Domesday Book's compilation in 1086. Pottery has played an important role in Wrenthorpe's history, building from the presence of a few potters in the 15th century, to a thriving cottage industry that peaked in the 17th century, before declining over the course of the 18th. Such was the scale of pottery production, the village became known as \\"Potovens,\\" attributed to the kilns used to fire finished pottery. Reminders of this heritage can be found in local names, such as \\"Potovens Lane\\" and the remains of pottery and clay tobacco pipes that can be found in the soil. As the potteries declined, coal mining, already present on a smaller scale providing fuel for the potters' kilns, expanded to meet the needs of the Industrial Revolution. Agriculture also grew more important to the area. During the 19th and early 20th century rope and woollen textile production joined coal and agriculture as Wrenthorpe's major industries, both disappearing over the course of the 20th century. Rhubarb forcing houses were built in Wrenthorpe, contributing to West Yorkshire's extensive Rhubarb growing industry. Education Wrenthrope is served by two state primary schools, Wrenthorpe Primary School and Jerry Clay Academy. Both are pyramid schools of Outwood Grange Academy in nearby Outwood. There are two co- educational independent schools in the village: Silcoates School which provides an education for pupils aged 2 to 18 and Hall Cliffe Primary School, which is a specialist day school for pupils aged 5 to 13 years, based at the old Sunny Hill House School site. Recreation and sport Wrenthorpe Park has facilities including hard tennis courts, a bowling green, children's playground, football pitch and car parking. Park paths connect with the neighbouring village of Alverthorpe through Alverthorpe and Wrenthorpe Meadows, a Local Nature Reserve with managed hay meadows and wetland areas. A smaller recreation ground with a football pitch, is located in the centre of the village on Wrenthorpe Lane. Wrenthorpe Cricket Club's senior teams compete in the Central Yorkshire Cricket League. Wrenthorpe Cricket Club equalled the record of consecutive Heavy Woollen cup final victories, with four wins in a row. The feat was previously done 120 years ago by Dewsbury & Saville CC. The club has junior teams ranging from under-9s to under-17s. Wrenthorpe Rangers are a local football club with junior teams from U6 through to U18s and open age teams that compete in the Wakefield Sunday league. The New Pot Oil pub hosts an open age team which competes in the same league. The 2013‚Äì2014 season was the most successful season for Wrenthorpe Rangers as they completed the league and cup double with a penalty shootout victory in the final of the cup over local rivals, the New Pot Oil.http://wakefieldanddistrictsundayleague.pitchero.com Wrenthorpe Badminton Club offers both social and competitive play, with teams in the Castleford & District League and the Barnsley & District League. It also provides junior coaching for 10- to 16-year-olds.

Professor Lassen mentions them as the name of the people of Kutch of Gujarat state. They appear in the Ganapatha of Panini of 5th Century B.C. K K Das Gupta has attempted to show that they existed even in Brahmana period. They were enterprising people having prosperous trade and commerce. Their capital was Kotesvara or Kachchhesvara. Mahabharat Chapter 52. A. Cunningham has also mentioned about them in the archaeological survey report V page 155 and also his book Ancient Geography of India at page 254. Kotesvara was a celebrated place of pilgrimage on the western shore of Kachh, close to Indus and to the great ocean. It is on the bank of Kori branch of Indus. There was a temple of Shiva in the middle of city. The meaning of Kotesvara is 10 million Ishvara. It is the name of Shiva. Audumvara like other tribes namely Sibi, Mujavats and Mahavrises were worshipers of Shiva, whereas Aryans worshiped Vishnu in the earliest times. Kotesvara is now only a small village and the temple Kotesvara is still there and worshipped. Kachh is also called Rann of Kachh. The word Rann is evidently a corruption of Irana, which means a salt land (Amarkosha). It is the Eirinon of the periplus of the Erythraean sea. There was another place Audumvara in Punjab which is the present city Pathankot. It was also known as Pratishsthana. It is on Jalandhar Jammu road about 80 km before Jammu. It was also known as Dahmeri, Dhamari, Dhammeri etc., which is apparently a corruption of Sanskrit name Audumvara of the country and tribe, whose coins have been found in Kangra (In Himachal Pradesh), Pathankot, Ropar and Hoshairpur (Punjab). From the coins of 200 B.C. ‚Äì 48 A.D. it appears that for some time Audumvara were under Indo-Greek and after that under Kusanas. The Prakrit legends Aduinvarisa ‚Äì ‚Äòof the Audumvara‚Äô appears on the copper coins and pieces of Audumbara tribe in Punjab. The word Audumvara refers either the people connected to the Fig tree, Audumvara or where the tree was grown in abundance. It appears that a section of Audumvara tribe migrated to Gujarat, may be due to internal conflict or some aggression. In course of time these people merged into local population.

It is the UK's largest girl-only youth organisation. Girlguiding is a charitable organisation. Within Girlguiding, participants take on adventurous activities, such as climbing, canoeing, sailing and orienteering and have the opportunity to get involved in camps and international events, including girl-only festivals and overseas development projects. In local groups ‚Äì called 'units' ‚Äì girls complete badges and challenges that cover topics from circus skills, stargazing and scientific investigation, to first aid, camping and community action. Each year, the organisation publishes the Girls' Attitudes Survey, which surveys the views of girls and young women on topics such as body image, career aspirations and mental health. Girlguiding is also a campaigning organisation, having supported the No More Page 3 campaign and lobbied the government on sexual harassment in schools, women's political representation and media sexism. Guiding began in the UK in 1910, when Robert Baden-Powell, founder of The Scout Association, established a separate organisation for girls.http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4280000/newsid_4284600/4284663.stm The Guide Association was a founding member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) in 1928. Girlguiding is supported by around 100,000 volunteers. History Girl Guides in camp, 1930 Following the origin of the Boy Scouts in 1907 many girls took up Scouting. In 1909, a number of Girl Scouts attended the Boy Scout Rally in Crystal Palace Park The girls told Robert Baden Powell that they wanted 'to do the same thing as the boys'. Guiding was introduced to respond to the demand. In 1910 Robert Baden-Powell formed the Girl Guides and asked his sister Agnes to look after the Girl Guides organisation. A few years later Baden-Powell's new wife Olave became involved and, in 1918, was appointed Chief Guide. The name Guides was chosen from Baden-Powell's military background, \\"Guides\\" had operated in the north- west frontier in India, their main task was to go on hazardous expeditions. These men had particularly influenced Baden-Powell as they continued training minds and body even when off duty. As a result, Baden Powell decided Girl Guides would be a suitable name for the pioneering young women's movement he wished to establish. In 1914 Rosebuds were established for girls aged 8‚Äì10, this name was later changed to Brownies. Two years later in 1916 the first Senior Guide groups were formed, in 1920 these groups became Rangers. 1943 saw the establishment of the Trefoil Guild for members over 21 (now 18) who wished to remain a part of the movement but couldn't remain active with a unit. The section for the youngest members of the association, Rainbows, was introduced in 1987 for girls aged 5‚Äì7 (4‚Äì7 in Ulster). In 1936 the then Girl Guides Association was one of the founding members of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS), which was created with the aim of promoting and supporting youth development work across England. Girlguiding has remained a member of NCVYS ever since. In 1964, a \\"Working Party\\" was established to review and update the whole programme of the association; their 195-page report was published in 1966 under the title Tomorrow's Guide. These recommendations were implemented in 1968 and included new uniforms, badges and awards across all the sections of the association. Land, Sea and Air Rangers were merged into a single Ranger Guide Service Section. Programme Girls are organised into sections by age. These are Rainbows, Brownies, Guides and Rangers. =Rainbow Guides= Rainbow Guides or Rainbows are aged from 5 to 7 year old, except in Northern Ireland where girls can join from age 4. Activities are organised around six core areas: Know myself, Be well, Express myself, Take action, Have adventures, Skills for my future. In the UK the girls used to wear a tabard in one of the colours of the Rainbow, now the newer uniform is worn. There is a baseball cap, cycle shorts, hoodie, jogging bottoms, and polo shirt to choose from. Each girl makes a promise on joining a Rainbow unit and must be able to understand and want to make this promise. This Promise is a simpler version of the one all members make. Rainbows can also receive other badges for activities that they attend (possibly with other units), and other activities they complete within their unit, maybe after a themed half term. During 2008, a special challenge book Olivia's Favourites was produced to commemorate the 21st Birthday of the section and a badge was produced. At the end of the Rainbow programme, as the girls get ready to move on to the Brownie section, girls undertake the personal Pot of Gold Challenge. =Brownie Guides= Brownie Guides or Brownies are from seven to ten years old. Brownies work from within six core themes: Know myself, Be well, Express myself, Take action, Have adventures, Skills for my future. Brownies can choose to work on meeting activities, skills builders and Interest badges . Brownies units are no longer called Packs but simply called Units. Units are divided into Sixes, small groups of girls who work together. Sixes are traditionally named after fairies e.g. Gnomes, Leprechauns; however, many Units have adopted the new naming style, woodland animals. Each six has a leader called a 'Sixer' and a 'Second'. The adult leader in charge was traditionally called Brown Owl with other leaders being named after different owls. However, these days, some units still stick to the Owls ‚Äì although the variety of owls has increased much but most have a variety of themes including flowers, Winnie the Poo characters, gems or even stars. Brownies have mix and match clothing based around the colours of yellow and brown. Items include baseball caps, gilets, cycle shorts, hoodies, leggings, long-sleeved tops, short sleeved tops, skorts, trousers and a sash. Brownie packs may also wear neckers. =Guides= Guides are from 10 to 14 years old. Guides work with six core themes: Know myself, Be well, Express myself, Take action, Have adventures, Skills for my future. Guides can choose to work on meeting activities, skills builders and Interest badges. They take part in indoor and outdoor activities that challenge them to do their best. Guides choose and plan most of their own activities, which can include themed evenings and trips. Guide units meet regularly, usually once a week during school terms. There are often other opportunities for Guides to take part in special activities and events throughout the year. Many Guide units go away on holiday, to camp or on overnight sleepovers. Guides work in small groups between 4 and 8 called a patrol. Patrol names vary between different units but include flowers, like rose and poppy, animals, like panda and parrot and famous landmarks, like pyramids. Each patrol is run by a patrol leader who is assisted by her patrol seconder. The Patrol Leader can be elected by her patrol, elected by the whole unit or chosen by the leadership team. The Patrol Leader is given extra assistance from the leader team to develop her Leadership skills. =Rangers and Young Leaders (previously known as Senior Section)= For girls between 14 and 18 years old, there are a variety of schemes and groups to choose from. * Young Leaders work with Rainbows, Brownies or Guides. They can work towards the Young Leadership Qualification as well as other Rangers opportunities. * Rangers meet together to plan and carry out activities, they may work towards any opportunities available to Rangers members. * Duke of Edinburgh's Award Participant: a Rangers member who has chosen to focus on the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. * Lone Ranger: a Rangers member who is working on part of The Rangers programme, but is not part of a standard unit. She may belong to a Lone Unit with other Lone members with support from Leaders who deliver the programme remotely. * Peer Educator: (Previously known as In4mer) anyone who has undergone the Girl Guiding peer education training and continues to run Peer Education sessions * Student Scout and Guide Organisation (SSAGO) Member: For members who are studying at higher education (such as a university or college). * Appointment Holder * Innovate ‚Äì an annual residential event of varying location across the UK which offers Rangers members an opportunity to voice their concerns and brainstorm new ideas for the future of Girlguiding. With the new program Rangers have new badges in the same vein as the younger sections. This group choose to wear a hoodie, jacket, polo shirt, or smart shirt. Rangers Awards and Qualifications * Young Leader Qualification * Chief Guide's Challenge * Commonwealth Award * Queen's Guide Award * Residential permits * Adult Leadership Qualification * The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Uniform The Girlguiding uniform has evolved over the years, from its first design by Baden-Powell and his sister: long dresses, neckerchiefs (like the Scouts) and wide hats. The previous uniform was designed by Ally Capellino in 2000. There are no compulsory trousers, but girls in guiding wear what is appropriate for the activities. Promise All members of Girlguiding make a promise upon joining. The current promises for each section are: Rainbows: I promise that I will do my best, to think about my beliefs, and to be kind and helpful. Brownies, Guides, members of The Senior Section and Leaders: I promise that I will do my best; To be true to myself and develop my beliefs, To serve the Queen and my community, To help other people and To keep the (Brownie) Guide Law. =History of the Promise= In 1994, the promise was changed from 'To do my duty to God' to 'To love my God', in order to accommodate different faiths, and the word 'God' was allowed to be replaced with a faith's own word for their god (e.g. Allah). Some do not feel they are able to make a promise that mentions god, particularly atheists and this has attracted criticism from the National Secular Society. In 2013 a nationwide consultation of the promise was carried out by Girlguiding. This took the form of a questionnaire with 44,000 respondents being asked for opinions on each line of the promise (not just 'Love my God'), and gave a number of options of different wordings. Effective from 1 September 2013, the words 'to be true to myself and develop my beliefs' replaced 'to love my God', and the words 'to serve the Queen and my community' replaced 'to serve the Queen and my country'. The rewording has been criticised by some Christian organisations. Brownie Guide Law A Brownie Guide thinks of others before herself, and does a good turn every day. Guide Law for Guides, The Rangers and Leaders # A Guide is honest, reliable and can be trusted. # A Guide is helpful and uses her time and abilities wisely. # A Guide faces challenges and learns from her experiences. # A Guide is a good friend and a sister to all Guides. # A Guide is polite and considerate. # A Guide respects all living things and takes care of the world around her. Administrative structure in the UK For effective administration of Girlguiding, the UK is split into smaller areas. At the top level there are ten Countries and Regions. The Countries are: * Girlguiding Scotland * Girlguiding Ulster * Girlguiding Cymru * Girlguiding BGIFC = British Guides in Foreign Countries The Regions are: * Girlguiding Anglia * Girlguiding London and South East England (known as LaSER) * Girlguiding Midlands * Girlguiding North East England * Girlguiding North West England * Girlguiding South West England (includes the Channel Islands, etc.) Countries and Regions are split into Counties. These in turn are split into Divisions. Divisions are split into Districts. In some areas with few members, County, Division or District level may be omitted because effective communication occurs without it. Each area is led by a Commissioner. Girlguiding outside the United Kingdom Girlguiding is also active outside the United Kingdom. In nine British overseas territories, there are branch associations with slightly different Guiding programmes adapted to the local conditions. Most of the branch associations use different uniforms or lighter textiles. Branch Associations are active in * Anguilla * Bermuda ‚Äì Girlguiding Bermuda * British Virgin Islands * Cayman Islands * Falkland Islands * Gibraltar * Montserrat * Saint Helena & dependencies * Turks & Caicos Islands More details can be found in The Branch Association Members website. British Royal Family in Guiding Guiding in the UK has had a long association with the British Royal Family, in 1920 Princess Mary, daughter of George V became President of the Association, 1937 saw Princess Elizabeth, who would go on to be Queen Elizabeth II become a Guide, and Princess Margaret become a Brownie. Princess Elizabeth joined the 1st Buckingham Palace Unit, whose first meeting was held on 9 June. She became the Second of Kingfisher Patrol, and was enrolled by her Aunt Princess Mary, Association President, on 13 December. At the start of World War II the company was closed, and the Queen and Princess Margaret were attached to a Balmoral Company. In 1942 the Buckingham Palace company reopened at Windsor, the Queen became Patrol Leader of Swallow Patrol. In 1943 the Queen became a Sea Ranger undertaking usual activities including gaining her boating permit and taking out the Queen Mother in a dinghy. She became Chief Ranger of the British Empire in 1946. When she married Lieutenant Mountbatten two of her bridesmaids were former members of the Buckingham Palace company. In 1952 when she ascended the throne she became the association patron. When Princess Mary died Princess Margaret became the new President in 1965. In turn on the death of Princess Margaret, the Countess of Wessex, wife to Prince Edward became President in 2003. The highest award in Guiding, the Queen's Guide award was created in 1946, this is now presented by the Association President. Centenary celebrations Girlguiding celebrated its centenary in 2009. The historic maze at Crystal Palace was re-opened on 5 September, remembering the 1909 Crystal Palace Scout Rally. The Centenary Camp was held from 31 July‚Äì7 August 2010 at Harewood House. The tall ship Lord Nelson made a 100-day voyage around the coast of the UK to celebrate the centenary. The Lord Nelson set sail from Glasgow on 7 June 2010. She has called at Oban, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Boston, London, Chatham, Portsmouth, Falmouth, Milford Haven and Whitehaven. At each port she took on new crew, many of whom had never sailed before.

Madron is named after Saint Madern's Church. Its annual Trafalgar Service commemorating the death of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson was started on 27 October 1946, following a local tradition that his death was first announced on British soil in the Union Hotel, Penzance. Geography It is a large rural parish on the Penwith peninsula north of Penzance, bounded by the parishes of Sancreed and St Just to the west, by Zennor and Morvah to the north, by the sea and the parish of Paul in the south and by the parishes of Gulval and Penzance to the east. Madron village is centred on an elevated site approximately two miles (3 km) northwest of Penzance town centre.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The main villages and hamets are Tredinnick, Lower Ninnes, New Mill, Newbridge and Tregavarah. The population was 1,466 at the 2001 census,2001 UK Census rising to 1,591 at the 2011 census. The parish church is in the churchtown and is dedicated to St Madron (or Madrona) (in local dialect \\"Maddern\\"). History Trembath Cross Boscathnoe Cross Evidence of early medieval habitation at Madron is in the form of one or two inscribed stones. One was found in the wall of the village church and has since been removed; the inscription consists of a cross and legible text, but its meaning is not clear. The other inscription was reported by R. A. Stewart Macalister in 1949 as being 'built into the N. wall of the N. aisle, west of the entrance door' of the church, but has not been seen since; Elisabeth Okasha speculates that Macalister may have seen the inscription in another church, and misremembered its location.See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 178‚Äì84 Arthur Langdon (1896) records eight stone crosses in the parish, of which one is in the churchyard and one is at Heamoor. The others are at Boscathnoe, Boswarthen, Parc-an-Growse, Trembath Cross, Trengwainton Carn, and Tremethick or Trereiffe.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard Madron was recorded in the Domesday Book. It was within the Manor of Alverton, an area that in the Anglo-Saxon and medieval period formed much of what is now the southern part of west Penwith. The church itself was once under the control of the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem and was known by the Cornish name of Landithy, a name which is still used in parts of the village today. Madron Well was, until the 18th century, the principal source of water for the nearby town of Penzance and Madron Church was the mother church of Penzance. =Admiral Lord Nelson= The news of the death of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson following the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 was received first in Britain by the arrival of HMS Pickle en route to Falmouth under the command of Lieut. John Richards Lapenotiere in Mount's Bay. It is believed a fishing vessel from Penzance passed the news to the shore which was formally announced from the balcony of the Assembly Rooms (now the Union Hotel) in Chapel Street, Penzance. Since the mother church of Penzance was at Madron, the mayor of Penzance took up a procession which made its way to Madron where a memorial service was held and the Nelson banner was paraded for the first time. On it was the epitaph \\"Mourn for the brave, the immortal Nelson's gone. / His last sea fight is fought, his work of Glory done\\". Storms in the English Channel meant that Nelson's body did not arrive by sea in London until January 1806. However, subsequent literature on the Union Hotel and Madron Church makes no mention of these events, and it is not recorded in the borough records or the Royal Cornwall Gazette, the only Cornish newspaper at that time.Pool, P. A. S. (1974) The History of the Town and Borough of Penzance. Penzance: Corporation of Penzance. A tradition of an annual Trafalgar Service, held to commemorate the death of Nelson, was begun on 27 October 1946, when so many people attended that the service was relayed outside. These services continue to this day. The Trafalgar Fields housing development was so named to reinforce the links with Nelson. =Penzance Workhouse= The Penzance Union Workhouse once stood within the parish. The Penzance Poor Law Union was formed on 10 June 1837 and the population that fell within the Union at the time of the 1831 census was just under 40,000. The workhouse was built in 1838. Designed by George Gilbert Scott and William Bonython Moffatt, it was intended to house four hundred paupers and cost ¬£6,050 to build. It was in use until 1948 when the National Health Service came into being. Madron today Church Road, Madron Madron memorial garden Landithy Hall, which opened in 1909, contains the community rooms and tea rooms where guests can stay the night and hosts many village events. It is here that Madron Parish Council holds the majority of its meetings, the other venue being Trythall School, near New Mill, as well as at St. Maddern's Primary School, below the church in Madron. Madron Feast Week is from the first Sunday in Advent. The Western Hunt traditionally meets at Madron on Feast Monday and also on Boxing Day. The village has a Garden of Remembrance for the dead of both World Wars. The local community radio station is Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 FM. =Local government= For the purposes of local government Madron elects its own parish council. From 1894 to 1934 it formed Madron Urban District. Under the 1934 restructure of local government the then Penzance Borough Council made representation to include the village of Madron within its boundaries but due to strong local resistance this move was defeated, most of the parish becoming part of West Penwith Rural District The nearby settlement of Heamoor (until 1934 part of the parish) was included within the revised boundaries of the borough and remains part of the parish of Penzance to this day. =Schools= Madron Primary School Madron Daniell's Endowed School was built by George Daniell in 1710 (his family were Lords of the Manor of Alverton for part of the 17th century. The school is next to the parish church with a view over Penzance and Mount's Bay and has a cottage for the headmaster on site. The school was extended from the original two classrooms to its current size in the late 1960s. It has subsequently been renamed St Maddern's Church of England School. =Playing field= The village has a King George V Playing Field which is home to Madron Football Club. Previously it has been home to Madron Cricket Club and the Penzance & Newlyn Rugby Club 2nd XV. =Buildings and gardens= Madron Well Clouties tied to a tree near Madron Well The nearby Madron Well is an example of a Cornish Celtic sacred site, which is renowned for its healing properties. A May Day tradition, which was still being observed in 1879, was for many young folks (mainly girls) to head from Penzance before sunrise, to perform a ceremony, to learn the number of years they have to wait before they get married. Two grass stems or straw, each about an inch long were fastened together with a pin and dropped into the water. Any rising bubbles denote the number of years before they get married. The ceremony was no longer held on May Day, but on a Sunday, because the girls work during the week. A tradition at this site persists to this day whereby people attach pieces of rag (clouties) to the nearby bushes as a symbol of appeasement to the spirits within the well site (see also Clootie well). According to The Cornishman newspaper this tradition was no longer carried out in 1879. Until the 18th century it was the only source of water for Madron and Penzance. Madron Baptistry A short distance away is the ruined well-chapel (also known as Madron Baptistry), which has been dated to the 6th century, but is likely to have even earlier foundations. The building measures 7 metres by 5 metres and has no roof, and it is not known if it ever had a roof. Ivy and wild roses creep over the walls and ferns grow from between the granite blocks. It is a classical site for the nationally scarce, Cornish moneywort (Sibthorpia europaea). Spring water, from the same source as the original well, is fed into a stone basin in the south-western corner. A low altar stone may be seen against the eastern wall, and stone seats line the walls.

Babcock, a trustee of the Ophir Mine, part of the Comstock Lode silver mining boom in Nevada, and solved one of the Comstock mines' most critical engineering needs.Online Nevada Encyclopedia, Philip Deidesheimer, accessed May 4, 2014 =Comstock Lode= Square set timbering Deidesheimer invented a system, now known as square set timbering, using heavy timber \\"cubes\\" as supports for underground mining tunnels and shafts, that enabled skilled miners to open three-dimensional cavities of any size. In large openings, the cubes could be filled with waste rock, creating a solid pillar of wood and rock from floor to roof (\\"back\\" in miner's terminology). Deidesheimer created the square set timbering system for the Comstock Lode's Ophir Mine in Virginia City, Nevada, in 1860.Grant H. Smith (1943). The History of the Comstock Lode. The system, which was inspired by the structure of honeycombs, enabled mining of the large silver orebodies of the Comstock Lode, which were in very weak rock‚Äîin miner's terms, \\"heavy ground\\". Deidesheimer refused to patent the innovation,http://www.bitofhistory.com/WebPages/NVWeb/SquareSetTimbering.html Square Set Timbering which was easily the most important mining innovation of 1860.Rodman W Paul (1963). Mining frontiers of the Far West, 1848‚Äì1880. p. 64. . ; Ophir Mine As was common with the Comstock mines, the rock in the Ophir Mine was soft and easily collapsed into the working stopes (cavities where ore is extracted). In addition, the presence of clay that would swell greatly upon exposure to air caused great pressures that the mine timbering of that day could not hold back. The square set timbering method devised by Deideshimer slowed the swelling action long enough for ore extraction, though with time and decay the timbering was crushed by the enormous pressures found in the Comstock mines. Deidesheimer was made superintendent of the Ophir Mine by mine owner William Sharon in early 1875. He was bankrupted by speculation in mining stocks in 1878. =Other mines= In 1866 Deidesheimer designed and supervised the construction of the Hope Mill and smelter for the St. Louis and Montana Mining Company, to process silver ore from nearby mines in Granite County, Montana.Montana Mining History Association: History of Philipsburg and Granite, Montana The town that formed around the Hope Mill was named Philipsburg, in honor of Philip Deidesheimer.Don Spritzer (1999) Roadside History of Montana, Missoula, Montana: Mountain Press, , p.220-222. After the decline of the Comstock mines in the late 1870s, Deideshimer continued his successful mining engineer career at the Young America Mine in Sierra City, California, where he was one of the five mine owners made rich over the five years of good production at that mine. In media The development of his square-set timbering method was fictionalized in \\"The Philip Deidesheimer Story\\", a 1959 first-season episode of the American television series Bonanza, in which John Beal portrayed the title character.\\"The Deidesheimer Story\\", Bonanza Booomers Philip Deidesheimer was the subject of the NPR radio program The Engines of Our Ingenuity in episode 1901 and was inducted into the (USA) National Mining Hall of Fame.National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum ‚Äì Leadville, Colorado, minerals, gems, history See also *Drift mining *Shaft mining *  References  Underground mining Category:American mining engineers Category:German mining engineers Category:German Jews Category:Hessian emigrants to the United States Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:People from Darmstadt Category:People from Virginia City, Nevada Category:People from Granite County, Montana Category:1832 births Category:1916 deaths Category:19th-century German engineers Category:20th-century German engineers Category:Engineers from Hesse ","title":"Philip Deidesheimer"},{"id":"2503804","text":"The list of presidents of the Royal Society of Canada is a list of all the past and present presidents of the Royal Society of Canada. * 2017‚Äì2019 Chad Gaffield * 2015‚Äì2017 Maryse Lassonde * 2013‚Äì2015 Graham Bell * 2011‚Äì2013 Yolande Gris√© * 2009‚Äì2011 Roderick A.

It is notable for its extremely large Polish immigrant and Polish American community. Before the Polish settled, Port Richmond was first discovered by Jacques Lafayette, a famous pirate in the 1700s. The neighborhood is also home to a large Irish American community and sizable German and Italian communities as represented in the various churches and organizations. In more recent years, a sizable Albanian community has moved in. The Richmond Zip Code is 19134 and 19125. The neighborhood is bounded by the Castor Avenue to the northeast, York Street to the southwest, I-95 and the Delaware River to the southeast, and Trenton Avenue to the northwest. While some people dispute the western boundary of the neighborhood, stating either Aramingo Avenue or Frankford Avenue, general consensus among residents on either side of Trenton Avenue or the railroad is that those east of it claim Port Richmond and those west of it claim Kensington. While some have referred to Port Richmond as Richmond, there is an area named Richmond, not colloquially used often, that refers to the most northeast section of the neighborhood. Adjacent neighborhoods are Bridesburg to the northeast, Juniata to the north, Harrowgate and Kensington to the west, Fishtown and Olde Richmond to the south. History = Colonial and coal eras = Colliers at Port Richmond circa 1875 In colonial times, most of today's Port Richmond was owned by Anthony Palmer, the founder of Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood. Palmer put together various parcels of land starting around 1704. He named the estate he built \\"Hope Farm,\\" and in 1729 sold this estate to William Ball. Palmer then purchased the old Fairman Mansion estate which bordered on the south of \\"Hope Farm\\" and built his town of Kensington. Over time some manufacturing began at the southern end of \\"Hope Farm\\" and this area became known as Balltown. There were glass and textile concerns located there during the later part of the 18th century. During the 1800s, with the advent of the steam engine aboard ships, Port Richmond was a major terminus for colliers who received coal from the Reading Railroad facility at the port, and transported it to steam ships at other locations. Colliers, as well as other merchant and military ships, continued to visit Port Richmond for coal until after World War I when coal-burning steam engines on ships were replaced by more modern oil and diesel engines. = Early 20th century = Allegheny Avenue looking west from Richmond Street Salmon Street, a typical area side street Port Richmond, at the beginning of the century, was a working-class neighborhood, and most workers simply walked to their nearby workplaces with lunch pail in hand. Cars were not common and those who had them stored them in stables. Stables for horses and cars were located in various parts of the area. Streets‚Äîunlike now‚Äîwere generally free of parked vehicles, allowing hucksters and other vendors space to easily proceed down the narrow side streets with their horse and wagon on a daily basis. European immigrants arrived in large numbers and lost no time in scrimping and working long hours to earn sufficient money to purchase modest row homes, such as those along Chatham Street. Usually, the only heat in such homes was provided by a coal- fired range in a tiny kitchen. Some comfort could be had in the fact that these homes contained tiny rooms, generally two downstairs and two upstairs, and were easy to keep warm from the heat of the kitchen range. Such homes were generally twelve feet wide, and the entire length of the house was about twenty four feet. Cellars consisted of plain dirt floors. The fact that the homes were row homes, which were joined together by common walls, helped them retain heat during cold winter spells. Only the fronts and backs of each home presented themselves to the coldness of winter. Why the cellars along Chatham Street, for example, contained dirt floors is not entirely clear, unless it was because the cellars were used simply for wood or coal storage or because cement was not a widely used product at the time. A ton of coal sold at the time for about four or five dollars and would be sufficient for the entire winter. However, most people bought coal by the bucket from a street peddler who came by daily in his horse-drawn carriage. The outsides of these homes consisted of wooden steps and brick sidewalks. Since this type of housing was of economic construction, the bricks in the sidewalk were laid in a crosshatch pattern in sand. When bricks were used in construction of the walls of the house, the mortar mix was made from lime and sand. Chatham Street homes were constructed in the late 19th century. Later, row homes in Port Richmond were generally sixteen feet wide and contained a cemented cellar, a coal-fired heater, and an upstairs bath for a total of for a total of five or six rooms. Such newer homes, like those on Almond Street, for example, increased in size as prosperity improved for the residents. These homes were palatial when compared with Chatham Street homes, and contained a coal-fired furnace that provided central heat. They generally consisted of three bedrooms and a bath upstairs, and also a living room, dining room, and a kitchen downstairs. (See the Salmon Street photo for examples of this type of row home.) Port Richmond residents were frugal and bought produce from the many street vendors who came by daily with their horse-drawn carts, loaded with fresh vegetables from nearby farms, located not very far away. Housewives could buy cabbage, cucumbers, potatoes, apples, and other vegetables by the bushel and store or preserve them for the winter. Gas mains were installed in the neighborhood by the city of Philadelphia, and gas was metered into each home for cooking and illumination. The meter was in the basement, and required someone in the household to occasionally feed it coins to keep the gas flowing. On Port Richmond sidewalks, tall gas lamps illuminated the streets. During each evening a lamplighter would come by to light the street lamps by igniting them with a very long device he held up in his hands.The Challenge of the Times, by Tom Bojanowski, 1992, privately published. =Wars= , the first modern battleship was built at Cramp Shipyard in 1891 Port Richmond played a major maritime role in American wars from the American Revolution and onward through World War II. The William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, established in 1830 and located nearby, provided skilled work for local workers, who built the battleships and the for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the late 19th century. The shipyard, and others in the area, also built surface ships during the American Civil War‚Äîsuch as ‚Äîand during World War I, and World War II when Cramps' workforce employed 18,000 skilled workers. During World War II, Port Richmond contained numerous docks and wharves for the loading and unloading of war cargo. In addition, the riverside area contained numerous ancillary facilities, such as warehouses, workshops, and offices. The Reading Railroad had used the port as a terminus for the transfer of coal, and, during the war, railroad service remained a vital function of the port, for its ability to quickly transfer goods to and from the port. The old Orinoka Mills in Richmond, was used as a training and wartime production facility in association with Mastbaum during the war. Today, the port is smaller than it was in World War II, although some marine services still remain, such as the Tioga Marine Terminal at Tioga and Delaware Avenue. =Railroad derailments= Frankford Junction in Port Richmond is an important point on the Northeast Corridor rail artery, as well as being the site of several major rail accidents. On September 6, 1943, the northbound Congressional Limited, a nonstop Pennsylvania Railroad passenger train, bound from Washington, D.C., to New York City, derailed near Port Richmond, killing 79 people and injuring 117 others. On May 12, 2015, at the same site, an Amtrak train derailed. Culture The Lithuanian Music Hall on Allegheny Avenue in Port Richmond Port Richmond is a vibrant neighborhood with a deep and proud cultural history encompassing several centuries. Stores, some located down side streets, are small and numerous because of the nature of the existing row home architecture where row homes and homefronts have been converted to use as stores. However, many of these stores and drinking establishments offer food, drink and charm which is unique to the neighborhood. Many Port Richmond homes have been refurbished and are now occupied increasingly by younger people, who no longer walk to work at the once bustling Port Richmond docks or to the tanneries and looms of their predecessors, but are employed in various parts of the city of Philadelphia, returning home in the evenings to the comfort of their picturesque neighborhood. Unfortunately, as the narrow side streets are a product of the horse-and-buggy era, car parking is a problem. The Russell H. Conwell School, George L. Horn School, John Paul Jones Junior High School, James Martin School, Thomas Powers School, Richmond School, and Francis E. Willard School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. = Polish heritage = St. Adalbert Church on Allegheny Avenue. There are many Polish delis and restaurants throughout the neighborhood, evidence of the Polish ethnic background of the neighborhood. The neighborhood continues to attract Polish immigrants. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries when immigration was at its peak in Philadelphia, Polish people settled on farms in Port Richmond. Soon, the Polish population increased massively, which produced rowhomes with their notable marble steps, and creation of Saint Adalbert Church, which was built in Polish Cathedral style. Today, there are a number of restaurants and stores in the area of Richmond Street and Allegheny Avenue that cater to the Polish-American community. The Krakus Market on Richmond Street offers a large selection of Polish and Eastern European foods, including a variety of kiebasy, Polish canned goods, Polish newspapers and various types of Polish pastries, such as Babka, Chrusciki and Paczki. Philadelphia‚Äôs award-winning Polish American String Band which marches in the Mummers Parade down Broad Street on New Year‚Äôs Day, sometimes marches and struts through the neighborhood, as on Port Richmond‚Äôs Memorial Day celebration. A half-dozen blocks west on Allegheny from Richmond Street, there is an ancient park, Campbell's Square, where neighborhood children play and where special community events are sometimes held. Despite its strong Polish roots, where even now, many still speak the language in ordinary conversation, the area has also served other nationalities, such as the Lithuanians. In addition to the area's Polish ethnicity, Lithuanians‚Äîwho have historically always been strongly linked with the Polish nation‚Äîhold their festivals and dances, as well as catered affairs for the community, at the Lithuanian Dance Hall on Allegheny Avenue, just a few blocks west of Richmond Street. The Lithuanian Music Hall is currently the home of the Theatre Company of Port Richmond, a community theater providing entertainment to the community since 1984. Demographics Port Richmond is largely a working-class Polish American community, and has been so for decades. As of the 2010 Census, Port Richmond was 76.7% non Hispanic white, 14.7% Hispanic of any race, 5.8% non Hispanic black, 1.8% Asian, and 1.1% all other. A more recent US Census estimate released in 2014 for the year 2013., indicates that the Port Richmond community is much more diverse. For example, zip code 19134 with 60,000 inhabitants, has 23,000 Puerto Ricans and 5550 Polish Americans. Zipcode 19125 has 1400 Polish Americans. In Port Richmond, as in every old ethnic enclave in Philadelphia, demographic change is occurring at a rapid pace.US Census Bureau: American Factfinder 2009-2013  Principal thoroughfares  The main thoroughfares of Port Richmond are Allegheny Avenue, running east/west, Richmond Street and Aramingo Avenue, both running north/south. Allegheny Avenue is the location of the largest Catholic church in the area Nativity B.V.M. as well as Our Lady Help of Christians Church. Their children, along with St. Adalbert's attend Our Lady of Port Richmond Regional Catholic School. Richmond Street, south of Allegheny Avenue, runs parallel to Interstate 95 and contains a large number of Polish shops which serve the local Polish community. Krakus supermarket is shown in the photo at right. Syrenica, a Polish restaurant, is located across the street from Krakus. Italian and Polish bakeries bake fresh bread and various traditional pastries and meats. A small luncheon restaurant called \\"Kitty's\\" (formerly \\"Rats\\") features a collage of pictures that splash the walls with the history of the neighborhood. It is located on the corner of Salmon and Somerset streets. Port Richmond is also historically noted for the trolley tracks that run down Richmond Street (see photo at top of page) along the Delaware River. The trolleys have recently been restored and are running again. Center City Philadelphia, with its metropolitan stores and historic tourist attractions, is not that far away. There is a southbound entrance to Interstate 95 on Allegheny Avenue, a half block east of Richmond Street, and I-95 will quickly take you to Center City Philadelphia, areas of South Philadelphia or the Philadelphia International Airport. On the other hand, to see the dynamic structures of Old City, Philadelphia, a drive to center city could be made south on Richmond Street and continuing on south on Delaware Avenue, providing a wonderful view of what remains of the ship terminals that once made the Port of Philadelphia a bustling seaport. The Port Richmond Trail is part of the East Coast Greenway. Religion Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church opened in 1882, and two others later opened: St. Adalbert in Philadelphia and Our Lady Help of Christians. On July 1, 2019 St. Adalbert and Nativity BVM, along with Mother of Divine Grace Parish and Saint George Parish, merged into a single congregation. St. Adalbert was chosen as the parish church of the merged Nativity BVM, which was renamed St. John Paul II Parish. Education Richmond Branch The School District of Philadelphia operates public schools. Our Lady of Port Richmond Regional School was established in September 2008 by the merger of Nativity B.V.M, Our Lady Help of Christians, and St. Adalbert. Each of the predecessor schools had enrollments of about 200. The 2008 economic downturn prompted the schools to merge. There were 545 students in the merged school in 2008, but the continued economic malaise resulted in declining enrollments. By 2016 enrollment was at about 400 and recovering.

The parish includes the hamlets of Elcombe and Shadwell. The village is situated in a wooded valley in the Cotswold escarpment, on the B4066 road between Dursley and Stroud. The placename (recorded as Euuelege in the Domesday Book) probably signifies 'clearing in a yew wood'. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Shadwell, Elcombe and Bencombe, all to the south of the village of Uley, and the hamlet of Crawley to the north. The population of the civil parish is around 1,100, but was much greater during the early years of the industrial revolution, when the village was renowned for producing blue cloth.  History  Uley, with Uley Bury rising behind it, as seen from Bencombe The Romans built a temple at West Hill, near Uley, on the site of an earlier prehistoric shrine. Following the laying of a water main pipe there in 1976, many discoveries were made including numerous Roman writing tablets or lead curse tablets from the temple area. These writing tablets appear often to relate to theft, and here the mention of animals and farm implements is a regular theme. There is an ongoing, online project to catalogue all those found at West Hill. Other remains from this temple, including a fine stone head of Mercury, can now be seen in the British Museum. There were significant Roman villas nearby at Frocester, Kingscote, and Woodchester, and there is a little-known Roman villa beneath Cam Peak on the road into Dursley. St Giles's Church near the village green was designed by the 19th-century architect Samuel Sanders Teulon. His building replaced an earlier church dating back to Norman times, which had in its turn replaced a Saxon church. The nearby church of the Holy Cross at Owlpen also has Saxon origins: the church there was rebuilt in 1828 by Samuel Manning and enlarged and decorated in 1876 by James Piers St Aubyn. There were also non-conformist chapels at South St and Whitecourt until the early 1970s. The village was once famous for its large number of pubs (around 14), lately reduced to a single hostelry (The Old Crown). Until the 1970s there was also a butcher's shop and a petrol station, these were subsequently replaced by antique shops and occasional restaurants, and now only a small village shop remains. St Giles' church and the Old Crown pub, from the village green The area surrounding Whitecourt appears to have some considerable historical significance, with long associations to the Osborne family and a possible Roman road transecting from Kingscote to the East via Bencombe, crossing the Ewelme brook close to the previous mill buildings opposite Stouts hill and then transiting what is now Lampern View before exiting west towards Cam/Coaley; elements clearly visible just uphill of Bencombe (as the road veers 90 degrees to the north) and to the West opposite the entrance to Angeston Grainge/Nursery (where it enters the wood as a paved and walled causeway. The increased mechanisation of agriculture in the area (arable on top of the escarpment, sheep on it and cattle in the valleys) led to a gradual decline during the inter-war periods and this led to the construction of three local authority housing estates - South Street, Lampern View and Raglan Way. However, increased mobility following the construction of the M4 and the Severn Bridge in the mid-1960s, together with an influx of skilled/managerial/professional workers following the establishment of such facilities as the Berkeley power station, led to a steady gentrification of the village, witnessed by the construction of substantial detached homes, for example at Court Gardens, South Street and Green Close. Economy Uley Brewery was established in the 1980s, in a Grade II listed building that had been part of the 1833 Price Brewery which closed at the end of the 19th century. The brewery was purchased and refitted by current owner Chas Wright, complete with custom-made brewing vessels. The brewery is situated above a natural spring, and uses Maris Otter barley malt (sourced from Tuckers Maltings, Newton Abbot), Fuggles and Goldings hops, and a traditional method of top fermentation. Its range of ales includes Old Spot Prize Ale, a 5% abv old ale, and Uley Bitter, a 4% abv cask bitter.  Amenities and surrounding locality  The following amenities and attractions are available in and around the village: * North of the village is a Neolithic burial mound known as Hetty Pegler's Tump or Uley Long Barrow. * Uley's only remaining pub, the Old Crown, is situated on the village green, opposite the church. * The Prema Arts Centre, founded in the 1970s, is located in a former Baptist Chapel in the village and offers educational courses in the arts and crafts, musical evenings, workshops, cultural events and evening classes in many subjects. * Uley CofE VC primary school has around 100 pupils. Uley Primary School can be found in Woodstock Terrace. The school was rated 'good' by Ofsted and 'outstanding' by SIAS, both in 2012. * A Reading Room (Library) burned down in the mid-1960s and has not been replaced. * An ancient Iron Age hill fort called Uley Bury lies just above the village. The Cotswold Way, a popular trail path, runs close by. * Downham Hill lies just to the west: it is known locally as 'Smallpox Hill' because of the smallpox isolation facility that stood on the top of the hill many years ago. It is believed to have been one of the earliest isolation hospitals in England. Masonry from the buildings remains visible at the site. Near the summit of the hill lie the remains of an ancient tower-like cottage built in the reign of king Edward III, around the time of the Black Death, in 1346. * To the east is Owlpen Manor, a Tudor manor house connected with the arts and crafts movement, mainly built from the mid- fifteenth to early seventeenth centuries, but dating back to Saxon times. It was repaired by Norman Jewson in 1925‚Äì6, after one hundred years of neglect. Today it is a home of the Mander family. * Stouts Hill, a neo-Gothic country house just outside the village, was the birthplace of the Gloucestershire historian, Samuel Rudder, and of the distinguished Persian scholar Edward Granville Browne. Built for the Gyde family, from the 1770s it was a seat of the Lloyd-Baker family, who in the 20th century let the house as a preparatory school. It included amongst its alumni Mark Phillips, Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, but closed down in 1979.  People  * Brigadier Mike Dauncey lived in the village until his death in August 2017. * Richard Clyburn invented an early adjustable spanner.  Trivia  * In 1837, Moses Bendle Garlick, a weaver from Uley, migrated to Australia and settled just north of what is currently Adelaide; he named the settlement Uleybury. * During the 1920s, Miss Edna Cunningham, brought a baby gorilla to Uley. John Daniel, as the gorilla was known, lived and was raised as a normal child by Miss Cunningham. When John Daniel grew too large, he was sent to the USA. Without the company of Miss Cunningham, John Daniel fell sick and died. Upon his death he was stuffed and can still be seen today in the Natural History Museum, New York.

Medically assisted drug therapy treatment is indicated in patients who are opioid dependent or have a history of opioid dependence. Methadone is a schedule II (USA) opioid analgesic, that is also prescribed for pain management. It is a long-acting opioid that can delay the opioid withdrawal symptoms that patients experience from taking short-acting opioids, like heroin, and allow time for detoxification.Ilene Anderson, Thomas E Kearney (January 200) ‚ÄúUse of Methadone.‚Äù Medicine Cabinet. Retrieved November 11, 2018. In the United States, by law, patients must receive methadone under the supervision of a physician, and dispensed through an opioid treatment program certified by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration.Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (09/28/2015) ‚ÄúMethadone‚Äù. Retrieved November 11, 2018 Regulation and policy In the United States, there are approximately 1500 methadone clinics that are federally certified opioid treatment programs. There are generally two types of methadone clinics, public and private. The public clinics are generally cheaper to attend. However, there is usually a waiting list due to limited funding. The private clinics are more expensive to attend but usually have either a short or no waiting list. In many parts of the United States, methadone clinics are few and far between, which presents problems for addicts seeking methadone treatment who live far from a clinic. The greatest concentrations of clinics are in California, Maryland, New York, and New Jersey. All methadone clinics must register as an accredited opioid treatment program with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration and renewed yearly or every three years based on accreditation time-frame awarded. Additionally, methadone clinics must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration before methadone can be dispensed. While not restricted to adults, this treatment method is generally not considered for people under the age of 18. Methadone clinics in the United States operate under strict regulations by state and federal laws. Before entering treatment, a patient must be given adequate information to provide informed consent about starting treatment. This information includes reasons for treatment and recommendation, the side effects and risks of treatment, and rules that must be followed to receive methadone treatment. After a physician ensures that the patient voluntarily chooses to receive treatment through a consent form, treatment planning can begin. The patient must show current addiction to an opioid, using accepted medical criteria such as those listed in the DSM-5 and have evidence that he or she became addicted at least 1 year before admission for treatment.‚Äú42 CFR 8.12 - Federal Opioid Treatment Standards.‚Äù Legal Information Institute, Legal Information Institute, Retrieved November 1, 2018 Prior to administration of treatment, a clinical evaluation is required asking about drug use history, co-occurring disorders, and impact of abuse on life, along with providing information about the treatment goals and guidelines. A medical evaluation is also given in the form of a urinalysis test, a review of past and current health history, and a test for certain conditions which are known to be prevalent in addict populations, such as HIV, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. The medication is monitored by nursing staff and is prescribed by a physician. As of 2013, due to the strict changes in receiving prescription pain medication as well as decreases in prescription abuse, the requirements to be accepted into methadone clinics have changed in areas such as New York State. Use of methadone clinics Methadone clinics can provide methadone for on-site administration. Additionally, some methadone clinics can provide oversight of treatment, observed dosing, consultation services, urine drug test, naloxone distribution, mental health services, primary care services, and HIV and HCV services. Although not required by regulation at this time in the United States, people are usually encouraged to attempt other types of treatment methods prior to entering methadone treatment programs. Since its use beginning in the 1960s, methadone is still the preferred choice of treatment at the clinics, and is often part of other protocols.The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) provides the protocol of how to treat addiction with recommended options including medication assisted treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and medical detox. Other than methadone, newer medications with fewer side effects including buprenorphine and naltrexone have been introduced, relieve drug cravings, block opioid effects, and avoid physical dependence. CBT is an individualized treatment plan that allow therapists to explore patterns of maladaptive substance use to help generate alternative behavior skills. Medical detox ensures safety and comfort by providing long-term monitoring until the symptoms of withdrawals are over.\\"What to Know About Methadone Clinics.\\" American Addiction Centers, Retrieved November 1, 2018 An important part of treatment for addiction is counseling. Methadone clinics are only for recovering addicts from opioids. Clinics require attendance at counseling groups as well as individual counseling contacts. It is generally accepted that the more intensive the counseling contacts the individual is willing to submit to, the higher the success rate of the program. Also, an integral part of counseling is on preventing the exposure and transmission of HIV. Clinics should be able to provide or refer patients to various services: community resources, vocational rehabilitation, education, employment, and prenatal-care. There is no set guideline for duration of methadone treatment, however, longer treatments are associated with better outcomes. Patients receiving methadone treatment in a closed setting should be assisted when transferring to a community-based setting. Patients who voluntarily decide to stop methadone treatment should speak to their provider to discuss why they want to stop and other treatment options. Effectiveness While methadone clinics are generally considered to be effective treatment options for patients addicted to opioids, especially when other interventions have failed, there is controversy surrounding the placement of methadone clinics. There is a perception that the presence of the clinics attracts crime to surrounding areas. However, one study by the University of Maryland School of Medicine found that is not the case, crime rates do not increase when a methadone clinic is opened. A 2004 GAO study notes that placement of clinics can impede recovery and exacerbate relapse: ‚ÄúAlthough these clinics are intended to help those in need of rehabilitation, patients who seek treatment must navigate their way to and from the clinics in an environment in which illegal sales of narcotics are daily occurrences. The efforts of patients who are seeking rehabilitation, and clinic professionals who serve them, are significantly undermined by this criminal activity that surrounds them.\\" See U.S. Gov‚Äôt Accountability Office, GAO-04-946T, Drug Rehabilitation Clinics: Illegal Drug Activities Near Some District of Columbia Clinics Undermine Clinic Services and Patient Rehabilitation 4 (2004) Between 70-90% of patients who discontinue methadone maintenance will relapse. The high relapse rate may be partially due to the severity of cases seen at methadone clinics, as well as the long-term effects of opioid use. Some patients will be on methadone for the rest of their lives, which generates criticism regarding the effectiveness of the clinics. Supporters argue that the clinics aim not just to eliminate narcotic addictions, but also to help people function in their lives. Methadone clinics may decrease the use of emergency rooms by patients addicted to opioids According to a 2009 Cochrane review, methadone maintenance treatments decreased the likelihood that heroin dependent patients would use heroin, but did not change crime or mortality rates. However, the bulk of the current research supports the hypothesis that methadone clinics do in fact reduce overdose and substance-related crime. https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45682955/j.1360-0443.2005.01050.x20160516-31435-tbd2wi.pdf?response- content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DFour-year_follow- up_of_imprisoned_male_h.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm;=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz- Credential;=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190716%2Fus- east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date;=20190716T173805Z&X-Amz- Expires;=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders;=host&X-Amz- Signature;=cf998f93c204fadbf4f1b99a27eabf8b10f0ab759ebd1c5d957f2bd5434b94d8 https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/files/Spotlight-on- Opioids_09192018.pdf  References Category:Substance dependence Category:Drug rehabilitation Category:Clinics ","title":"Methadone clinic"},{"id":"2503909","text":"ADM-160B, Air Force Armament Museum. The ADM-160 MALD (Miniature Air-Launched Decoy) is a decoy missile developed by the United States. Overview =DARPA MALD program= The Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) program was begun in 1995 by DARPA as an effort to develop a small, low cost decoy missile for use in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses. Teledyne Ryan (acquired by Northrop Grumman in 1999) was granted a development contract for the ADM-160A in 1996, and the first test flight took place in 1999. The evaluation program was finished by 2001. The US Air Force planned to acquire several thousand of ADM-160A's, but in 2001 this was reduced to at most 150 for a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program. In January 2002, the USAF cancelled the program because the drone didn't have enough range and endurance to meet the service's requirements or to perform other missions.Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 6.0 Decoys The ADM-160A carries a Signature Augmentation Subsystem (SAS) which is composed of various active radar enhancers which cover a range of frequencies. The SAS can therefore simulate any aircraft, from the B-52 Stratofortress to the F-117 Nighthawk. The missile has folded wings to allow more compact carriage. On launch the wings unfold and a TJ-50 turbojet propels the missile on a pre-determined course which is composed of up to 100 different waypoints. An inertial navigation system with GPS support keeps the MALD on course. Although pre-programmed before the aircraft leaves the ground, the course can be modified by the pilot at any point up to launch. =New USAF competition= In 2002, the USAF renewed its interest in an air- launched decoy and started a new industry-wide competition for a variant with greater endurance. The contract for a new MALD was awarded to Raytheon in Spring 2003. The Raytheon ADM-160B is similar in configuration to the ADM-160A, but has a trapezoidal fuselage cross section and is larger and heavier. It is powered by a Hamilton Sundstrand TJ-150, a more powerful variant of the TJ-50. The first ADM-160B was delivered in Spring 2009.U.S. Air Force accepts first delivery of Raytheon Miniature Air Launched Decoy In 2010 an \\"operationally significant quantity\\" of the drones were delivered to the Air Force. The USAF currently plans to procure about 1,500. In 2008 a contract for a jamming variant MALD-J was awarded to Raytheon.

Dubbed the \\"World's Fastest Freight Train,\\" the all-TOFC (trailer-on-flatcar, or \\"piggyback\\") and COFC (container- on-flatcar, or container) train ran about 2200 miles between Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California on a 40-hour schedule.  Overview  The brainchild of company president John Shedd Reed, the Super C (led by a pair of EMD FP45s) made its first run on January 17, 1968, covering the distance in a record-breaking 37¬Ω hours averaging 58.2 miles-per-hour (93,6 km/h). The second test train did the ride even faster in 34¬Ω hours averaging 63.7 miles- per-hour (108.4 km/h). For an added fee of $1,400 per trailer shippers were guaranteed fast delivery. Santa Fe tried high-speed freight operations on its Illinois Division in late 1966. By year's end, passenger-geared GE U28CG locomotives took 19 piggyback cars from L.A.'s Hobart Yard to Chicago in 61 hours. On June 8, 1967 a joint run using New York Central's Flexi-Van container cars traveled from New York City to Los Angeles in 54 hours, 21 minutes. The Super C carried high-priority items such as auto parts and electronic components; the United States Post Office soon became a consistent customer. It was allowed 79 mph. Train length varied from one to 15 or 20 cars. In the end, too few shippers chose to pay for 40-hour delivery, especially considering that a standard TOFC load arrived in 15 hours more. The final blow came in 1976 when the Santa Fe lost its mail contract to a joint venture of the Chicago and North Western Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad that could deliver at lower cost on a 50-hour schedule. The Super C completed its last trip on May 20, 1976.

He is a guitarist, the bandleader, and the main songwriter for thrash metal band Exodus and was a member of Slayer from 2011 to 2019, replacing Jeff Hanneman following his death in May 2013. Biography =Career= Exodus After guitarist Tim Agnello left Exodus in 1981, Holt joined the band and has been the main songwriter and the most senior member of the group ever since. Following Kirk Hammett's 1983 departure from Exodus to join Metallica, Holt kept the band going and for many years, he and Rick Hunolt were referred to as the Exodus' \\"H-Team\\" guitar players. Holt is the only member of Exodus who has played on every album. Slayer On February 12, 2011, it was announced that Holt would be temporarily filling in for Jeff Hanneman in the band Slayer. Holt also played with Slayer for the Big 4 Concert in Indio, California on April 23, 2011, as well as Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas on November 6, 2011. Holt was later confirmed to be a permanent member of Slayer, following Hanneman's death on May 2, 2013, and stayed with the band until their split, following the conclusion of their 2018‚Äì2019 farewell tour. He also recorded guitar tracks on Slayer's 2015 album Repentless, but did not have any writing contributions on the album, except for guitar solos. =Other work= In October 2008, Holt released an instructional guitar video called \\"A Lesson in Guitar Violence\\". He also produced Warbringer's second album, Waking into Nightmares. In 2019 he was included on \\"Cheapside Sloggers\\", a song on Volbeat's Rewind, Replay, Rebound. Equipment Holt performing in 2012 Holt endorses ESP Guitars as of September 2014 and has a signature version of the Eclipse model, ending his relationship with Schecter Guitar Research, where he previously had various signature models. He has also used Ibanez, B.C. Rich, Jackson Guitars, Bernie Rico Jr., and Yamaha guitars. For amplification, he currently uses a Marshall Silver Jubilee in Slayer and an ENGL Savage 120 in Exodus as well as a Kemper Profiling amp. In the past, he has used a modified Marshall JCM800, Mesa Boogie Mark III, Marshall JVM, Peavey Triple XXX, and ENGL Savage 120. Before using the Silver Jubilee, DSL100H and Marshall JVM amps with Slayer, Holt made use of Jeff Hanneman's touring rack. Musical influences Holt's main guitar influences are Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Angus Young, Tony Iommi, Uli Jon Roth, Matthias Jabs and Ted Nugent. His favorite bands include Venom, Mot√∂rhead, Black Sabbath, early Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Personal life Outside of music, Holt enjoys foreign and period films. According to Holt, the track \\"War Is my Shepherd\\" on the album Tempo of the Damned is a treatise of America's \\"pro-God\\" and \\"pro-war\\" stance and how he feels the two beliefs are incompatible with each other. Holt endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, stating, \\"I used to have a lot of respect for McCain, but he realized after the dirty defeat that he suffered at the hands of George W. Bush in the South Carolina primary in the (2000) election that he can only get elected if he plays the Karl Rove tactic b.s. He's doing it. It's just one debunked lie after the other. He's the kind of guy who will tell you the sky is red, you look up and it's blue, and he won't admit he's wrong. He's playing dirty politics. Palin is just terrifying, the thought of this lady being a heart attack away from having the nuclear codes. She's crazy and she's dumb.\\" In the 2004 election, Holt vouched for John Kerry, but conceded that \\"they're all dirty crooks, all politicians. But at least (Kerry) wasn't a coward. He fought in Vietnam whereas George W. Bush Jr. was a draft dodger.\\" In 2017, he referred to President Donald Trump as a \\"serial liar\\" and an \\"embarrassment to this country, this world, and everyone living in it.\\" Holt is an atheist. In October 2017, he became a vegan. On December 17, 2018 his father Billie Charles Holt (born July 6, 1933) died. On March 18, 2020, Holt began exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. By March 31, 2020, he had tested positive for the disease, although by then he had already recovered.

Social representation theory is a body of theory within social psychology and sociological social psychology. It has parallels in sociological theorizing such as social constructionism and symbolic interactionism, and is similar in some ways to mass consensus and discursive psychology. Origin and definition The term social representation was originally coined by Serge Moscovici in 1961,Moscovici, S. (1961). La psychanalyse, son image et son public. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. in his study on the reception and circulation of psychoanalysis in France. It is understood as the collective elaboration \\"of a social object by the community for the purpose of behaving and communicating\\".Moscovici, S. (1963). Attitudes and opinions. Annual Review of Psychology, 14, 231-260. They are further referred to as \\"system of values, ideas and practices with a twofold function; first, to establish an order which will enable individuals to orient themselves in their material and social world and to master it; and secondly to enable communication to take place among the members of a community by providing them with a code for social exchange and a code for naming and classifying unambiguously the various aspects of their world and their individual and group history\\".Moscovici, S. (1973). Foreword. In C. Herzlich (Ed.), Health and illness: A social psychological analysis (pp. ix‚Äìxiv). London/New York: Academic Press. In his study, Moscovici sought to investigate how scientific theories circulate within common sense, and what happens to these theories when they are elaborated upon by a lay public. For such analysis, Moscovici postulated two universes: the reified universe of science, which operates according to scientific rules and procedures and gives rise to scientific knowledge, and the consensual universe of social representation, in which the lay public elaborates and circulates forms of knowledge which come to constitute the content of common sense. Moscovici's pioneering study described how three segments of French society in the 1950s, i.e. the urban-liberal, the Catholic, and the communist milieus, responded to the challenge of psychoanalytic ideas. Moscovici found that communication processes, the contents, and their consequences differed across the three social segments. Moscovici identified propaganda as the typical communication of the communist milieu, whereby communication is ordered systematically emphasising incompatibility and conflict. The intention is to generate negative stereotypes. Propagation was the typical form of the Catholic segment, identified as didactic and well-ordered but with the intention to make limited concessions to a subgroup of Catholics with affinities to psychoanalysis, and simultaneously, to set limits to the acceptance within the established orthodoxy of the Church. Diffusion was typical of urban-liberal milieus, whereby communication was merely intended to inform people about new opportunities, with little resistance to psychoanalysis. Anchoring and objectification Moscovici described two main processes by which the unfamiliar is made familiar: anchoring and objectification. Anchoring involves the ascribing of meaning to new phenomena ‚Äì objects, relations, experiences, practices, etc. ‚Äì by means of integrating it into existing worldviews, so it can be interpreted and compared to the \\"already known\\".H√∂ijer, B. (2011). \\"Social Representation Theory\\", Nordicom Review, 32, 3‚Äì16 In this way, the threat that the strange and unfamiliar object poses is being erased. In the process of objectification something abstract is turned into something almost concrete. Social representations, therefore, are depicted as both the process and the result of social construction. In the socio-cognitive activity of representation that produces representations, social representations are constantly converted into a social reality while continuously being re- interpreted, re-thought, re-presented.Wagner, W. & Hayes, N. (2005). Everyday Discourse and Common-Sense: The Theory of Social Representation. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.Jovchelovitch, S. (2007). Knowledge in Context: Representations, community and culture, London: Routledge. Moscovici's theorisation of social representations was inspired by √âmile Durkheim's notion of collective representations. The change from collective representations to social representations has been brought about by the societal conditions of modernity.Alexander, J. C. (1995). Fin de Si√®cle Social Theory. London: Verso. Interpretation and developments Social representations should neither be equated with relatively stable collective representations, nor should they be confused with individual, cognitive representations. This has been elaborated by several authors who contributed to the theory: Gerard Duveen and Barbara Lloyd emphasized the articulation of the individual and the collective in micro-genetic processes of socialization,Duveen, G., & Lloyd, B. (Eds). (1990). Social representations and the development of knowledge. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Wolfgang Wagner theorized about the role of action and social interaction in the construction of social representations,Wagner, W. (1996). Queries about social representation and construction. Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 26, 95-120.Alison, C., Dashtipour, P., Keshet, S., Righi, C., et al. (2009). 'We don‚Äôt share! The social representation approach, enactivism and the fundamental incompatibilities between the two'. Culture and Psychology, 15(1), 83-95. and Sandra Jovchelovitch proposed to regard social representations as a space in- between, at the cross-roads between the individual and society that is the public sphere, that links objects, subjects and activities.Jovchelovitch, S. (1996). In defence of representations. Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 26, 121-136. Most authors agree that social representations are dynamic elements of knowledge that depend on social conflict and dispute to originate and that have a history of elaboration and change over time. Bauer & Gaskell integrate this view in their formal model relating three elements: subjects, or carriers of the representation; an object, activity, or idea that is represented; and a project of a social group within which the representation makes sense.Bauer, M.W. & Gaskell, G. (1999). Towards a Paradigm for Research on Social Representations. Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 29(2), 163-186. This conceptualisation is known as the toblerone model of social representations. There have been various developments within the field since Moscovici's original proposition of the theory. Jean-Claude Abric and his colleagues have explored the structural elements of social representations, distinguishing between core and peripheral elements in terms of the centrality and stability of certain beliefs. This approach has come to be known as the central nucleus theory.Abric, J.C. (Ed). (1994). Pratiques sociales et representations. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France Saadi Lahlou explores the relations between social representations and behavior, focusing on eating representations and consumer behaviour.Lahlou, S. (1995). Penser Manger, Paris, PUF. Other important developments have been made by Caroline Howarth in linking Social identity theory with the theory of social representations,Howarth, C. (2002). Identity in whose eyes?

Two of the classic works in the realm of this theory include Moscovici's own seminal work on representations of psychoanalysis in France, and Denise Jodelet's exemplary study of the social representation of madness.Jodelet, D. (1991). Madness and Social Representations. London: Harvester/Wheatsheaf. However, the theory is far from being a settled doctrine as it attracts ongoing debate and controversy from both social representationists and other theorists.Voelklein, C., & Howarth, C. (2005).

The social representation approach, enactivism and the ground for an intrinsically social psychology. Culture & Psychology, 13(1), 5-27. The theory is less known in the United States, partly because much of Moscovici's original work has been published in French.

United States, which was formed in 1982 by the former Green on Red drummer Van Christian and David Seeger, who had been in the original line-up of the Giant Sandworms (who later became Giant Sand) as well as The Pedestrians, a band credited with having performed the first punk rock show in Tucson. Other artists who recorded or performed with the band included members of Green on Red and the Sand Rubies, John Convertino and Joey Burns, later of Calexico, Chuck Prophet, Rainer Ptacek and longtime drummer Tommy Larkins, who currently plays with Jonathan Richman, famously appearing with him as half of the two-man Greek chorus in There's Something About Mary. Christian himself also performed with The Band of Blacky Ranchette (an occasional project of Giant Sand's Howe Gelb) and was in the original lineup of The Friends of Dean Martinez. Naked Prey's aggressive, distorted sound was characterized as \\"rough-edged country rock\\" and \\"folk-distorto-rock\\" and the band was credited with helping to pioneer the guitar-heavy \\"Desert Rock\\" sound associated with Tucson in the 1980s and 1990s. The band was also associated with the vaguely psychedelic Paisley Underground scene out of Los Angeles. In 1984 Naked Prey recorded their first record, produced by Dan Stuart of Green on Red for the Down There label of Steve Wynn (Dream Syndicate). Two subsequent releases were on Los Angeles- based independent label Frontier Records. Though they never achieved commercial success, they, like many Tucson bands, acquired a substantial following in Europe. The band broke up in the late 1990s, but Christian re- unites Naked Prey from time to time for occasional performances.

While the residential area (close to Penilee to the west and directly adjoining North Cardonald to the east, primarily consisting of cottage flats) is wholly within Glasgow, the greater part of the industrial estate on the other side of the Inverclyde Line railway tracks falls under the jurisdiction of neighbouring Renfrew, although uses a Glasgow postcode. History =World War II shadow factory= Montrose Avenue, Hillington Industrial Estate With the developing political situation in Europe in the mid-1930s, the British Government set up a plan to treble the output of the British aircraft industry. Under a plan managed by the Air Ministry, the Shadow factory plan was managed by industrialist Herbert Austin, with the aim to create nine new factories, and invest in enabling existing motor vehicle manufacturing plants to expand capacity and make the switch to aircraft production more easy. Rolls-Royce were key to the plan, and specifically production of their Merlin engine. Having developed a new facility themselves in Crewe, production director Ernest Hives was looking for a northern-based greenfield site with easy transport access, an available skilled workforce, and a local authority willing to build the required associated housing: Rolls had been let down in Crewe, and didn't want to repeat the experience. With its ready-built housing areas, easy access to the Glasgow to Paisley railway line, and in need of commercial activity, Hillington proved an opportunity not to be missed. The Air Ministry funded the factory construction, with the facility opening in 1937. The industrial estate was opened in 1938 by HM Queen Elizabeth, and was the first of its kind in Scotland. The first Merlin engines were produced two weeks before the start of World War II. By 1943, output had reached 400 engines each week, with production peaking at 100 engines in one day, and 1,650 a month. By the end of the war, the plant had manufactured 23,500 new engines during the war, 14% of the total Merlin production worldwide. =Post war= Taken over by Rolls-Royce themselves directly on 1 April 1947, the factory initially repaired and overhauled both Merlin and Griffon engines as well as producing spare parts. Increased requirement for the Avon turbojet for the Korean war meant that it switched totally to fanjet production, and in 1965 became a specialist compressor component manufacturing facility. The factory closed in December 2005, with all production moved to either the new facility at Inchinnan next to Glasgow Airport, or the redeveloped East Kilbride plantEnd of era for Rolls-Royce plant, BBC News, 15 December 2005 (which itself closed little over a decade later).

His rebellion was swiftly crushed, and he himself was executed. History Gellius Maximus was the son of Lucius Gellius Maximus, who had served as a doctor to Emperor Caracalla's doctor. For his services, Lucius Gellius Maximus received the rank of provincial procurator, making him the chief financial officer of his province. He himself did not achieve senatorial rank, but only the equestrian rank of procurator. In the year of Gellius Maximus' revolt, 219 AD, several other usurpers arose as well, using a variety of justifications for their legitimacy. Among them were Seius Carus, by virtue of aristocratic heritage, Elagabalus (who would go on to be emperor), Alexianus, and Castinus, by virtue of their relationship (or claimed relationship) to an imperial family, and Verus, by virtue of his military strength. Gellius Maximus likewise used his military strength as a justification for imperial legitimacy. Before his revolt, Gellius Maximus was a senatorial tribune (second-in-command of the legion) of Legio IV Scythica legion. During his command of IV Scythica, his troops captured Diadumenian, the son of the previous emperor, Macrinus. After this success, an unnamed centurion in IV Scythica won the gratitude of Elagabalus for his command, whereas Gellius Maximus was ignored, and remained in his command at Zeugma. His being ignored by Elagabalus may have inspired his revolt. He revolted in Coele-Syria, in 219 AD. His revolt was crushed rapidly due to the decisive action of the legate of the Legio XVI Flavia Firma, who had been stationed at the nearby city of Samosata, and whose name is only partially preserved, with the ending of his name being recorded as \\"atus\\".

Dean Park is located 43 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Western Sydney region. History Dean Park takes its name from the Dean family. William 'Lumpy' Dean (1776‚Äì1854) received two grants of land of 100 and 50 acres in 1817, and later a third one of 50 acres, beside Eastern Creek.Sharpe 2000: 33 His family owned the Bush Inn on the Western Highway. Dean Park is home to William Dean Public School named in honour of the Convict originally granted the land. The suburb was originally planned and developed in the early 1980s. Some of the street names are aboriginal in origin such as Yarramundi Drive. It is said that other street names take on the names of the original site developers, the Hoyle brothers (Nathan, Kenneth and Wayne). Population At the 2016 census, there were 3,227 residents in Dean Park. 58.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were Philippines 8.6% and India 3.9%. 57.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tagalog 5.9%, Arabic 5.3% and Hungarian 3.5%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 36.7%, No Religion 13.3% and Anglican 11.9%.

During NOE flight, geographical features are used as cover, exploiting valleys and folds in the terrain by flying in, rather than over, them. This keeps below enemy air defence radar coverage, avoiding being silhouetted against the sky. Other, mostly older terms include \\"ground-hugging\\", \\"terrain masking\\", \\"flying under the radar\\" and \\"hedgehopping\\". Purpose NOE is used to minimize detection by hostile aircraft, AWACS surveillance and control systems, ground-based radar, or attack targets. A high-flying aircraft can be detected by defense systems at long range, giving an air defense system time to react, alerting SAM and AAA missile systems and fighter aircraft. Using NOE flight, the approach may be undetected; the aircraft \\"pops up\\" to attack the target and then turns to escape before the enemy can respond. Doppler radar has the potential to detect NOE flight, but the incoming aircraft has to be within radar range in the first place, and low flight minimizes this possibility by using hills and mountains to break the line of sight (terrain masking), defeating terrestrial air defense radar and in rough enough terrain also airborne early warning. Sensors for NOE Most NOE flying is done during the day using visual reference by pilots who are experienced in low flying. Data from a radar altimeter or terrain-following radar system is also used, the latter enabling low flying in adverse weather where it would not be possible by visual reference and manual pilot control. At night, a night-vision device may be used. Helicopter NOE flying Helicopter following a river to enable low level flight The lowest NOE flying is by helicopters because they have lower speeds and more maneuverability than fixed-wing aircraft, particularly fast- jets. Helicopters can fly at treetop levels or even below the height of surrounding trees where there are clear areas (such as in river gullies),Helicopters at War - Blitz Editions, Bookmart Limited, 1996, flying under wires (such as electricity cables) rather than over them. Attack helicopters can hide behind trees or buildings, \\"popping up\\" just enough to use their (rotor mast-mounted) radar or other sensors and then minimally exposing themselves to launch weapons. The required altitude depends on the type of terrain, such as low vegetation or low buildings, tree canopy layer of less than , presence of tall buildings or concrete pylons with heights of up to international standard, or emergent tree layer canopy and lattice steel electricity pylons to being present. Over populated areas with tall radio transmission towers, an altitude of AGL applies. In May 2011, four U.S. military helicopters evaded the Pakistani air defense system during the Osama bin Laden mission. Officials in Pakistan attributed the failure to detect the aircraft to their use of nap-of-the-earth flying techniques.http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/pakistan-military-caught-in- the-crossfire/article1991627.ecePakistan military caught in the crossfire - Baqir Sajjad Syed Dawn, The Hindu, May 5, 2011 Height above ground level Height above ground level (AGL) in NOE and low flying generally vary with the aircraft speed, aircraft maneuverability and the ruggedness of the terrain. Helicopters are capable of flying with no more than a few feet of clearance below the helicopter's skids or wheels. Fast jets are more constrained and at a typical low-flying speed of 450 knots (800 km/h), 200 feet (60 m) is not unusual and 50 feet (15 m) is possible in relatively flat terrain. Power wires are a danger to all aircraft flying at low level and \\"wire strikes\\" are common, such as the Cavalese cable car disaster. Special maps are produced that plot the routes of these wires but these are difficult to keep up-to- date, especially for foreign/enemy countries. Pilots are trained to scan for the pylons or power-poles that support these wires, because they can be seen at a distance where the wires themselves cannot.

Housing Housing in Dharruk is almost entirely low density in nature and is a mixture of private residential development and former NSW Housing Commission estate; most homes in the suburb were built between the late 1960s and the mid 1970s. The Housing Commission properties were erected in the north eastern portion of the suburb (in the vicinity of Dawson Public School); however, the majority of housing in Dharruk consists of slightly newer homes built by private residential development companies in the 1970s. As elsewhere in NSW, many of the former Housing Commission properties have been transferred to private ownership. The 2016 Australian census indicated that 30% of occupied private dwellings in Dharruk were rented while approximately 65% were owned outright or in conjunction with a mortgage. Commercial area While there are limited commercial and retail outlets within Dharruk, the suburbs of Emerton, Plumpton, and Mount Druitt are all in very close proximity and offer access to a wide range of supermarkets, banks, and department stores. Schools Chifley College's Mount Druitt campus is located within Dharruk. Formerly Mount Druitt High School (established 1969), it is named for Ben Chifley, Australian Prime Minister of Australia from 1945 to 1949. Nearby is Dawson Public School (established 1972).

Playing career Born in Maesteg, Bowen first played for Northampton Town. He had only played 12 times for Northampton before catching the eye of Pat Whittaker, son of Arsenal manager Tom Whittaker. He was duly signed by Arsenal in the summer of 1950 as an understudy to Joe Mercer at wing half. He made his debut against Wolves on 24 March 1951, but only made a handful of appearances between 1951 and 1954, when Mercer finally retired due to injury. Arsenal won the old First Division in 1952‚Äì53 but he only made two league appearances all season. In 1954‚Äì55 Bowen became a regular in the Arsenal side, and would continue to be for the rest of the decade. In the meantime, Bowen had also made his debut for Wales, in a friendly against Yugoslavia in September 1954. Bowen went on to win 19 caps for Wales, and was the team's captain for their 1958 FIFA World Cup campaign; Wales drew all three of their group matches and qualified for the quarter-finals, where they were beaten 1‚Äì0 by Brazil, the goalscorer being a 17-year-old Pel√©. Along with goalkeeper Jack Kelsey, Bowen was the first Arsenal player to play in a World Cup. Bowen's spell at Arsenal coincided with a lack of success at the club, so he did not win any major domestic honours. However, he did play for a London XI in the 1955‚Äì58 final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (forerunner of the UEFA Cup), losing 8‚Äì2 on aggregate to FC Barcelona, and was Arsenal captain in his final two seasons. In all he played 162 matches for the club, scoring twice. Managerial career In 1959, Bowen returned to Northampton Town as player- manager. Bowen would manage the Cobblers for eight years, and became known as a canny manager who signed quality players despite a tight budget. He steered Northampton from the Fourth Division to the First in just five seasons. However, the club spent only one season (1965‚Äì66) at the top, before being relegated. Bowen left Northampton in 1967, after a second successive relegation, though he rejoined the club for a second stint as manager between 1969 and 1972, by which time they had returned to the Fourth Division. He presided over the club's famous 8‚Äì2 FA Cup defeat at the hands of Manchester United, in which George Best scored six times. In the meantime, he had also been manager of Wales between 1964 and 1974, although the side never did reach the heights it had when he was a player. Wales however did gain a 1‚Äì1 draw away to England in the 1974 World Cup qualifiers, a result that would prove costly to England. Bowen continued to stay with Northampton, serving as general manager, secretary and finally as a club director before retiring. He also had a sideline in journalism and bookmaking during his managerial career and was a summariser for ITV alongside commentator Hugh Johns for their coverage of the 1966 World Cup final. Personal life He died in Northampton in 1995, at the age of 67. The North Stand of Northampton's Sixfields Stadium is named in his honour, as is a residential street in Duston. His son Keith also became a footballer.

Originally a native of the Mediterranean region, it is now grown commercially in several parts of the world for birdseed. This large, coarse grass has erect, hairless stems, usually from tall. The ligule is prominent and membranous, long and rounded at the apex. The gradually tapering leaf blades are long, wide, flat, and often harsh on both surfaces. The compact panicles are erect or sometimes slightly spreading and range from long with branches long. Single flowers occur in dense clusters in May to mid-June or August. Inflorescences are green or slightly purple at first, then become tan. The seeds are shiny brown. The seed is used as bird food and is generally mixed with rapeseed and other seeds that cheapen it. It should be kept in a dry place and away from vermin. Industrially, a flour made from seed is employed in the manufacture of fine cotton goods and silk stuffs. Canary seed output in 2006 Phalaris canariensis resembles Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass), a perennial forage crop and a wild grass. Although heads of both crops are panicles, Phalaris canariensis heads resemble club wheat. In the Canary Islands, Italy and North Africa, Phalaris canariensis is used as food. In certain parts of Mexico, such as Valle de Bravo, it is prepared and sold by street food vendors as a much appreciated form of atole.

Assisted by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, he reports to the Minister for Home Affairs. The post was created with the passing of the Police Act in 1857, in response to calls for a full-time dedicated police officer to helm the police force in response to escalating cases of violent crime in Singapore during that period. Thomas Dunman thus became the first police commissioner, and the first full-time superintendent of police, with a salary of 800 rupees per month. When the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Malacca, Penang) became a Crown Colony in 1867, the role of the police commissioner was expanded to include that of the entire Straits Settlements, with the title changed to that of Inspector-General of Police. This lasted until the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in 1942, before the post was restored as the Commissioner of Police in 1946 with the return of the British and the gradual instatement of local rule.

As \\"Vadim Shevtsov\\", he was later the head of the Ministry of State Security of Moldova's pro-Moscow separatist state of Transnistria between 1992 and 2012. He is a Russian and Transnistrian citizen and was for many years wanted by the law enforcement agencies of Latvia and Moldova. He is no longer wanted by the Latvians however due to their statute of limitations on the type of crime he was alleged to have committed. In July 2014, Antyufeyev became one of leaders of Ukraine's pro-Russia secessionist rebels. Life and career Antyufeyev was born in Novosibirsk, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. In 1974, he graduated from a police academy in Minsk, Byelorussian SSR. He is a former Soviet OMON special police major and Riga police deputy chief of criminal investigation. He served as Riga OMON commander in 1990‚Äì1991. In August 1990, Antyufeyev was one of the organizers of a meeting of the Latvian MVD where some 80% of the Latvian police force made a decision not to recognize the Popular Front of Latvia government and follow the Constitution of the Soviet Union instead. These police forces would later be involved in the KGB-led failed pro-unity coup attempt in January 1991. For these actions the Latvian government accused Antyufeyev of \\"crimes against the state\\" in August 1991. He says he fled to Moscow two hours before he was to be arrested. In Russia, Antyufeyev was assisted by Viktor Alksnis, on whose recommendation he traveled to Tiraspol to take part in the Transnistrian independence movement in September 1991. Adopting a new name, \\"Vadim Shevtsov,\\" Antyufeyev played a key role in forming the internal affairs and security organizations of the Transnistrian government, especially the Ministry of State Security, which he headed. Shevtsov's real identity was revealed by Aleksandr Lebed in 1997. In 2003 Antyufeyev defended a doctoral thesis on \\"Russia's Geostrategy in the Southwest\\" at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. In 2004, the prosecutor of Moldova indicted Antyufeyev for crimes against the Moldovan state and freeing an officer accused of several assassinations. That same year, Vladimir Antyufeyev was declared persona non grata by the European Union. He married Galina Antyufeyeva, a deputy in the Transnistrian Supreme Soviet and head of the committee on legislation. Antyufeyev has stated: \\"We pose a real problem to Moldova. My life's purpose is to save this land [Transnistria] for Russia.\\" In early 2012, he was dismissed by the incumbent president Yevgeny Shevchuk and a criminal investigation was launched against him, alleging abuse of power, misappropriation of public funds and destruction of documents. Antyufeyev based himself in Moscow in 2012. He said he worked on security in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Crimea. In July 2014, he appeared in eastern Ukraine as the \\"deputy prime minister\\" of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). The DPR head Alexander Borodai met him in Moscow and put him in charge of the rebel security forces (taking over from Alexander Khodakovsky), internal affairs, and courts of justice.

There is a potentially infinite number of such compounds. Some of them are unstable and have not been isolated, but the derived anions and organic groups are present in stable salts and esters. The most important ones ‚Äî in biology, geology, industry, and chemical research ‚Äî are the phosphoric acids, whose esters and salts are the phosphates. In general, any hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom is acidic, meaning that the ‚ÄìOH group can lose a proton leaving a negatively charged ‚Äì group and thus turning the acid into a phosphorus oxoanion. Each additional proton lost has an associated acid dissociation constant Ka1, Ka2 Ka3, ..., often expressed by its cologarithm (pKa1, pKa2, pKa3, ...). Hydrogen atoms bonded directly to phosphorus are generally not acidic. Classification The phosphorus oxoacids can be classified by the oxidation state(s) of the phosphorus atom(s), which may vary from +1 to +5. The oxygen atoms are usually in oxidation state -2, but may be in state -1 if the molecule includes peroxide groups. =Oxidation state +1= * Hypophosphorous or phosphinic acid, (or ), a monoprotic acid (meaning that only one of the hydrogen atoms is acidic). Its salts and esters are called hypophosphites or phosphinites. =Oxidation state +3= * Phosphorous or phosphonic acid, (or ), a diprotic acid (with only two acidic hydrogens). Its salts and esters are called phosphites or phosphonates. =Oxidation state +4= * Hypophosphoric acid, (or ‚Äì). All four hydrogens are acidic. Its salts and esters are hypophosphates. =Oxidation state +5= The most important members of this group are the phosphoric acids, where each phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms, one of them through a double bond, arranged as the corners of a tetrahedron. Two or more of these tetrahedra may be connected by shared single-bonded oxygens, forming linear or branched chains, cycles, or more complex structures. The single-bonded oxygen atoms that are not shared are completed with acidic hydrogen atoms. Their generic formula is Hn‚àíx+2PnO3n‚àíx+1, where n is the number of phosphorus atoms and x is the number of fundamental cycles in the molecule's structure. These acids, and their esters and salts (\\"phosphates\\") include some of the best-known and most important compounds of phosphorus. Orthophosphoric acid, . The simplest member of this class is * Phosphoric acid proper, also called orthophosphoric or monophosphoric acid, (or ), a triprotic acid. It forms orthophosphate salt and esters, commonly called phosphates. The smallest compounds of this class with two or more phosphorus atoms are called \\"oligophosphoric acids\\", and the larger ones, with linear ‚ÄìP‚ÄìO‚Äì backbones, are \\"polyphosphoric acids\\"; with no definite separation between the two. Some of the most important members are: * Pyrophosphoric acid, (or ‚ÄìO‚Äì), with four acid hydrogens. Forms pyrophosphates. * Triphosphoric or tripolyphosphoric acid, (or ‚ÄìO‚Äì‚ÄìO‚Äì), with five acidic hydrogens. Forms triphosphates or tripolyphosphates. * Tetraphosphoric acid, (or (‚ÄìO‚Äì)2‚ÄìO‚Äì), with six acidic hydrogens. Forms tetraphosphates. Thebackbone may be branched, as in * triphosphono phosphoric acid, or P(O)(‚Äì)3, a branched isomer of tetrapolyphosphoric acid. The tetrahedra may be connected to form closed ‚ÄìP‚ÄìO‚Äì chains, as in * Trimetaphosphoric, or cyclo-triphosphoric acid, (or , (‚ÄìP(O)(OH)‚ÄìO‚Äì)3), a cyclic molecule with three acidic hydrogens. Forms the trimetaphosphate salts and esters. Metaphosphoric acid is general term for phosphoric acids with a single cycle, (‚ÄìP(O)(OH)‚ÄìO‚Äì)n, whose elemental formula is .

H. Lawrence; Lawrence conceived the idea for the novel while visiting Mexico in 1923, and its themes reflect his experiences there. The novel was first published by Martin Secker's firm in the United Kingdom and Alfred A. Knopf in the United States; an early draft was published as Quetzalcoatl by Black Swan Books in 1995. The novel's plot concerns Kate Leslie, an Irish tourist who visits Mexico after the Mexican Revolution. She encounters Don Cipriano, a Mexican general who supports a religious movement, the Men of Quetzalcoatl, founded by his friend Don Ram√≥n Carrasco. Within this movement, Cipriano is identified with Huitzilopochtli and Ram√≥n with Quetzalcoatl. Kate eventually agrees to marry Cipriano, while the Men of Quetzalcoatl, with the help of a new President, bring about an end to Christianity in Mexico, replacing it with Quetzalcoatl worship. The novel received negative reviews. Commentators have characterised it as fascist and an attack on Christianity, and seen it as expressing Lawrence's fears about the decline of the white race and belief in women's submission to men. It has also been interpreted as an expression of his personal political ambition and as having homoerotic aspects. Critics have disagreed about its literary merit. Some have found it inferior to his other work, but others have considered it his greatest accomplishment as a novelist, an assessment shared by Lawrence himself. The novel received attention in Mexico, where its early reception was positive, and it was praised by the poet Octavio Paz. However, this response was later displaced by Mexican post- revolutionary nationalism and post-colonial studies. The Plumed Serpent has been compared to works of Lawrence such as the novels Kangaroo (1923) and Lady Chatterley's Lover (1928) and the essays Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays (1932), as well as to the work of the poet T. S. Eliot. Plot Note: this description of the plot is based on the version of the book published as The Plumed Serpent, not the version published as Quetzalcoatl. Shortly after Easter, a group of tourists visiting Mexico, including Kate Leslie, an Irishwoman, and her cousin, Owen Rhys, an American, attend a bullfight in Mexico City. Leslie is thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the fight, but later leaves in disgust, after witnessing the violence suffered by a horse and a bull. As she leaves, she encounters Don Cipriano, a Mexican general, and invites him to meet her. Later, at a party in Tlacolula which she attends with Rhys, Leslie listens to discussions of changes brought about by the Mexican Revolution, and encounters a Major Law, who states that there is a rumour that the recently elected Mexican President, Socrates Tom√°s Montes of the Labour Party, will be prevented from taking office by the military. She also meets Cipriano's friend Don Ram√≥n Carrasco. Soon afterwards, she reads a newspaper report, \\"The Gods of Antiquity Return to Mexico\\", describing an incident in the village of Sayula, in which a man arose from a lake, then announced to a group of women that the Aztec gods Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc are ready to return to Mexico. Rhys returns to the United States, but Leslie decides to stay in Mexico. Wanting to leave Mexico City because of rising social tensions, she travels to Sayula, with the encouragement of Cipriano. She learns of a religious movement, the Men of Quetzalcoatl, and, upon making inquiries about it, is told that it was founded by Ram√≥n, who is suspected of having political ambitions. Leslie begins to sympathise with Ram√≥n, believing him to be a \\"great man\\". Receiving an invitation from Ram√≥n, she meets him and his wife Do√±a Carlota, who tells her that he wants to be worshipped as a god and to destroy the belief of Mexicans in both Jesus and the Virgin Mary, objectives she deplores. Cipriano tells Leslie that he wants to marry her and make her a goddess in a pantheon of deities alongside himself and Ram√≥n, explaining that this will help Ram√≥n. Leslie at first rejects these proposals and considers leaving Mexico. Meanwhile, the unpopular actions of the new President provoke a rebellion, and the Church moves against Ram√≥n, denouncing him as an \\"Anti-Christ\\". Cipriano continues to support Ram√≥n, despite being obliged to defend the Mexican government. Ram√≥n tries to remain politically neutral. Cipriano arranges a meeting between Ram√≥n and a bishop. Ram√≥n tells Cipriano that every people in the world needs its own \\"Saviour\\", and that the \\"Teutonic world\\" should return to the worship of Thor and Wotan, just as other nations should return to the worship of their ancient gods. When Ram√≥n and Cipriano meet the bishop, Ram√≥n suggests to him that the Catholic Church should embrace all gods, including Quetzalcoatl; the bishop rejects this. Ram√≥n tells the bishop that he intends to remove images from a church in Sayula, burn them, and replace them with images of Quetzalcoatl; the bishop warns him against this, but Ram√≥n remains firm in his plans, and tells the bishop to advise his superiors of them. Ram√≥n tries to encourage Kate to marry Cipriano, but she still has doubts. He tells her of the dissatisfying nature of his relationship with Carlota, saying that the two of them never \\"met in our souls\\", and that her faith in Jesus and his role in the Men of Quetzalcoatl now makes this impossible. He explains to Kate that, for him, Quetzalcoatl is a \\"symbol of the best a man may be\\". Soon afterwards, a priest is attacked after preaching a sermon against Ram√≥n and Quetzalcoatl, and later threatened with death. Priests denounce the Men of Quetzalcoatl. The church in Sayula is closed, and later entered by Ram√≥n and a group of his followers, who remove images of Jesus, Mary, and several saints. The images are taken away and burned. These events are followed by further incidents of violence and unrest. Kate travels to Jamiltepec, where she meets Ram√≥n and tells him that she approves of the removal of images from the church in Sayula. He encourages her to support his movement. When an attempt is made to assassinate Ram√≥n, Kate becomes involved in the conflict, and he afterwards credits her intervention with saving his life. One of Ram√≥n's followers tells Kate that priests and the Knights of Cort√©s are to blame for the attack. Kate meets Ram√≥n and Cipriano. Ram√≥n tells her that just as he will be identified with Quetzalcoatl, Cipriano will be identified with Huitzilopochtli. Kate accepts Cipriano as Huitzilopochtli and they are married by Ram√≥n. Afterwards, Kate returns to Sayula, where she learns that the church has been turned into a temple of Quetzalcoatl. A religious meeting presided over by Ram√≥n and Cipriano is interrupted by Carlota, who calls on God to take Ram√≥n's life. Carlota collapses and is taken to bed; she subsequently dies. Worship of Quetzalcoatl continues to spread through Mexico; Cipriano wants the President to declare it the official religion of Mexico, but Ram√≥n disagrees, believing that it should be allowed to spread of its own accord. Cipriano gives Kate the name \\"Malintzi\\". Ram√≥n later marries a young woman named Teresa. Kate tells first Teresa, then Cipriano, that she wants to leave Mexico. Later, an attempt is made to assassinate the President, and Mexico is taken to the point of religious war. In Mexico City, the Men of Quetzalcoatl turn a church into a Quetzalcoatl temple; the Archbishop of Mexico is arrested before he and his followers can attempt to retake the building for the Catholic Church. Eventually, the President has the Catholic Church made illegal and orders Quetzalcoatl worship made the official religion of Mexico; all churches are closed, and the Archbishop is deported. Kate and Cipriano are legally married. Ram√≥n tells Kate to tell the Irish that they should follow their traditional gods and heroes. Kate is left conflicted about whether to leave Mexico or not. Background and publication history D. H. Lawrence In March 1923, Lawrence, accompanied by the poet Witter Bynner and Willard Johnson, visited Mexico. There, according to the biographer Brenda Maddox, the \\"sight of Aztec ruins and the lush countryside outside Mexico City\\" gave him the idea for a book. Lawrence began writing The Plumed Serpent in May 1923. Maddox states that writing the novel was exhausting for Lawrence, and that it \\"nearly killed him\\", owing to the illness he contracted upon finishing it, which he did not expect to survive. She notes that the character of Owen Rhys was based on Bynner, and that the bullfight that occurs early in The Plumed Serpent was based on an actual bullfight Lawrence attended with Bynner and Johnson. She maintains that the bullfight scene reflects the disturbing effect on Lawrence of travelling with Bynner and Johnson, a homosexual couple. The Plumed Serpent was first published in 1926 by Martin Secker's firm in the United Kingdom and Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. The novel has also been published by Heinemann, Penguin Books, and Vintage Books. Lawrence wanted to call the book \\"Quetzalcoatl\\", after the Aztec god of that name, but Knopf insisted on \\"The Plumed Serpent\\", a title Lawrence disliked. An early draft of the book, different enough to be considered a distinct work, was published as Quetzalcoatl by Black Swan Books in 1995. Reception Critics have disagreed about the literary merit of The Plumed Serpent, some, including the novelist E. M. Forster and the writer John Middleton Murry, praising it as Lawrence's best work and others dismissing it. According to John B. Vickery, while most critics admired \\"Lawrence's masterful descriptions, his evocation of place and his handling of individual scenes\\", many also criticised his \\"humorless obsession\\" with saving Mexico and the world. Lawrence's biographer Harry T. Moore states that The Plumed Serpent received negative reviews from P. C. Kennedy in the New Statesman, the journalist Katherine Anne Porter in the New York Herald Tribune, and the novelist L. P. Hartley in the Saturday Review. He adds that additional negative reviews appeared in The Times Literary Supplement, which described the novel as \\"feeble\\", and The Spectator, which described it as \\"verbose\\". However, Moore writes that it received a more mixed assessment, discussing both its good and bad aspects, from the poet Edwin Muir in The Nation and Athenaeum. Moore himself maintained that The Plumed Serpent could be considered a \\"magnificent failure\\" and that it was \\"a greater achievement than the smoother work of the lesser authors celebrated at that time.\\" He considered its first six chapters to be its best part, writing that they contain \\"wonderful prose\\". He also noted that the novel sold well. Maddox writes that the novel received a negative review from Charles Marriott in The Manchester Guardian, who deplored its failure to produce convincing characterizations, a response similar to that of Hartley in the Saturday Review. According to Maddox, Porter considered the novel inferior to Lawrence's earlier work Sons and Lovers (1913), and believed that the difference in quality between the two works showed \\"the catastrophe that has overtaken Lawrence.\\" The Plumed Serpent received a mixed review from Time, which described it as \\"a strange, compelling state of affairs rather than a story\\", and wrote that it reflected the \\"physico-mysticism\\", and preoccupation with sexual psychology, of its author. Time wrote that Lawrence's work \\"moves many profoundly, puzzles others, and revolts the squeamish.\\" Donald Douglas wrote in The Nation that The Plumed Serpent contains \\"passages of miraculous wonder and words like arrows tipped with light borrowed from the sun\\" and that \\"Lawrence has all his old infallible and inexhaustible knowledge of woman's nature and his Indians bear all the fascination of an alien life perfectly understood.\\" Later assessments of The Plumed Serpent include those of F. B. Pinion, who considered it the most ambitious and successful of Lawrence's novels written after Women in Love (1920). Brett Neilson compared The Plumed Serpent to Women in Love, arguing that they imagined \\"the primitive\\" in similar ways and that both involved the theme of an \\"eternal conjunction between two men\\". He compared Ram√≥n to Rupert Birkin, a character of Women in Love, maintaining that they had similar \\"sexual philosophies\\". The critics F. R. Leavis and Harold Bloom have seen The Plumed Serpent as inferior to Women in Love, as well as to Lawrence's The Rainbow (1915). Bloom compared The Plumed Serpent to the novelist Norman Mailer's Ancient Evenings (1983), suggesting that it had a similar underlying motive. He has argued that Lawrence was writing as a political theorist in The Plumed Serpent, which he described as a \\"Fascist fiction\\". The poet Richard Aldington described The Plumed Serpent as \\"curious and original\\". He compared it to Frederick Rolfe's novel Hadrian the Seventh (1904), arguing that \\"in both books the author imagines himself raised to a position of power which he never had the faintest chance of attaining in fact on this earth.\\" He suggested that the novel shows Lawrence's \\"dissenting horror from the very things he is supposed to be preaching.\\" He interpreted Cipriano and Ram√≥n as projections of D. H. Lawrence. The writer Anthony Burgess maintained that The Plumed Serpent is the least liked of Lawrence's novels due to its lack of humour and its exploration of a theme of little interest to readers \\"with no knowledge of the ancient Aztec gods and what they could mean to a revitalized or Laurentianised Mexico.\\" He called its ending unconvincing. Leavis and Burgess have compared The Plumed Serpent to Kangaroo, Burgess finding the similarity to be their shared emphasis on bloodshed. Leavis maintained that unlike The Rainbow and Women in Love, but like Aaron's Rod (1922) and Kangaroo, The Plumed Serpent was \\"exploratory and experimental.\\" Though appreciating features such as its bullfight scene, he dismissed it as a bad book and the least complex of Lawrence's novels, arguing that it suffered from his single-minded concern with imagining a \\"revival of the ancient Mexican religion.\\" Critics have offered differing interpretations of Kate Leslie. Aldington and Burgess saw the character as a representation of Frieda Lawrence, but Leavis maintained that Leslie was not a representation of Frieda Lawrence. The critic Frederick Crews argued that the character was simply an opportunity for Lawrence to present \\"Lawrentian doctrine.\\" The Plumed Serpent has been criticised by feminist authors such as the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir and the activist Kate Millett. De Beauvoir compared Lawrence's view of female sexuality to that of the physician Gregorio Mara√±√≥n. She argued that The Plumed Serpent was the novel that most fully expressed Lawrence's ideal of female behavior, according to which the \\"woman must renounce personal love\\" and abdicate all pride and will. Millett described the novel as homoerotic. She considered its \\"consecration scene\\" an example of the \\"symbolically surrogate\\" scenes of pederasty in Lawrence's novels. She suggested that the novel was deservedly neglected, criticising Lawrence's \\"protofascist tone\\", \\"fondness of force\\", \\"arrogance\\", and \\"racial, class, and religious bigotries.\\" She maintained that the novel showed his search for triumph in politics and other areas of life, and that it records his invention of a religion of \\"male supremacy\\", with its prose celebrating \\"phallic supremacy\\". She described Leslie as a \\"female impersonator\\". The English professor Marianna Torgovnick suggested that the novel \\"advocates women‚Äôs slavelike submission to men and surrender of the drive toward orgasm\\" and suffered from \\"overblown prose\\". She considered it, like Lady Chatterley's Lover, vulnerable to Millett's criticism. Torgovnick saw The Plumed Serpent and Lawrence's story \\"The Woman who Rode Away\\" (1925) as sharing an interest in \\"extremes of experience\\", and found both similar to the work of writers such as Bataille, and the dramatist Antonin Artaud, in their emphasis on human sacrifice. She wrote that The Plumed Serpent \\"has been charged with protofascism\\", adding that it \\"states its racialised theses quite clearly at times. It posts Lawrence's views, derived from theories circulating within his culture, of the fall and rise of races based upon energy and power. Lawrence's fear is specifically the fear that the white race will be supplanted\\". She characterised it as being, like Aaron's Rod, part of a phase of Lawrence's career during which he was suspicious of and hostile towards women. L. D. Clark described The Plumed Serpent as \\"perplexing\\". He suggested that the work was both open to misinterpretation, and \\"a flagrant piece of propaganda\\", intended by Lawrence as a \\"new gospel to mankind.\\" He believed that it suffered from faults such as \\"careless language\\", \\"wearisome repetitions\\", and the \\"confusion of practical with artistic ends\\"; he considered its \\"prophetic aspirations\\" a fault as well. However, he considered the novel redeemed by, \\"Lawrence's profound sympathy with the land he was writing about, and his uncanny skill at synthesizing form and setting and symbol.\\" He argued that Lawrence was influenced by Blavatsky, and that his use of \\"bone symbolism\\" resembled Blavatsky's in The Secret Doctrine (1888). He suggested that Lawrence's interest in the symbol of the circle resulted in part from his reading of occult writers such as Blavatsky. He concluded that the novel's symbolism endowed it with \\"peculiar brilliance.\\" He noted that one scene, involving Ram√≥n and Cipriano, had been interpreted as evidence of Lawrence's \\"latent homosexuality\\", but rejected the interpretation. The cultural critic Philip Rieff described the work as \\"a novel of pagan religiosity\\". Rieff stated that in his \\"imaginative rehabilitation\\" of Aztec ritual, Lawrence \\"rightly understands sun dancing as an imitation ‚Äî or a dramatic representation ‚Äî performed in substantiation of the divine concern with the human being.\\" However, he saw the work as an embarrassment even to Lawrence's admirers. The critic Frank Kermode wrote that in 1928 Lawrence accepted Bynner's criticism of the \\"leadership mystique\\" advocated in the novel. The philosopher Michel Foucault considered The Plumed Serpent an example of how the modern \\"deployment of sexuality\\" has encouraged \\"the desire for sex‚Äîthe desire to have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth\\". The writer Henry Miller maintained that Lawrence showed \\"great creativity\\" in The Plumed Serpent, finding it apparent in the way Lawrence dealt with \\"the eternal duality in man's nature\\" by deifying it in the form of Quetzalcoatl. He compared its themes to those of Lawrence's The Man Who Died (1929), and praised the way in which Lawrence employed \\"the old myth of the dragon.\\" The novelist William S. Burroughs was influenced by The Plumed Serpent. The Mexican intellectual Enrique Krauze described The Plumed Serpent as \\"the most fascist\\" of Lawrence's writings, citing its \\"deification of violence and masculine power\\". The critic William York Tindall compared The Plumed Serpent to the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan, Gustave Flaubert's Salammb√¥, and the paintings of Paul Gauguin. He called it a \\"great novel\\" and \\"metaphor for a feeling about reality\\". Maddox compared The Plumed Serpent to Kangaroo, describing both novels as successors to Aaron's Rod. She also compared it to Lady Chatterley's Lover, which likewise features a man who \\"condescendingly instructs a woman in how to be a woman.\\" She stated that Frieda Lawrence, like D. H. Lawrence, considered it his greatest novel, and shared its message, which Maddox summarized as being that, \\"Christianity was outmoded and destructive and that the white races must find new modes of leadership to prevent the dark races from dragging them into anarchy.\\" She observed that one scene featuring Ram√≥n appearing before a rally evoked the Third Reich to later readers and encouraged the view that Lawrence was a fascist. She also stated that the work influenced Rolf Gardiner. The cultural critic William Irwin Thompson that the novel shows that Lawrence misunderstood the religion of ancient Mexico. The English professor Louis L. Martz stated that The Plumed Serpent resembles the Bible in its \\"combination of prose and poetry, its mingling of narrative and description with songs and hymns, lyrical sermons and eloquent authorial ruminations, along with its frequent use of occult symbols\\". He found the work a success so long as it is \\"read as a novel of prophecy\\". However, he found the published version of The Plumed Serpent in some ways inferior to the early version titled \\"Quetzalcoatl\\", noting that the early version gave Leslie a more significant role. Anne Fernihough described The Plumed Serpent as \\"stridently ideological\\", while Mark Kinkead-Weekes described it as more \\"ideologically elaborated\\" and assertive than its early version Quetzalcoatl, adding that Lawrence made a \\"deliberate and intransigent\\" attack on Christianity. He wrote that most reactions to it were either strongly positive or strongly negative, and stated that Lawrence later rejected \\"both the political and the sexual ideology\\" of the novel. Helen Sword compared The Plumed Serpent to Lady Chatterley's Lover, describing them both as novels in which, \\"Lawrence uses a woman's voice and consciousness to convey the message that women should submit physically and emotionally to men\\", while Paul Eggert described Lawrence's attempt to portray a \\"society renovated by a new religion\\" as pretentious and strained, Michael Bell called The Plumed Serpent strident and desperate in its rhetoric and maintained that, like Kangaroo, it showed sympathy for political authoritarianism, and Chris Baldick wrote that Leavis's dismissal of The Plumed Serpent has been accepted by most subsequent critics, including the philosopher Eliseo Vivas and Julian Moynahan, and become part of a consensus. Vickery considered it unfair to reduce the novel to a political plan, arguing that Lawrence's central concern was that people were being led \\"further and further away from the realization of their own essential nature\\", and that Lawrence's own views were different from those of Ram√≥n. He considered Lawrence's approach to primitive myth and ritual in The Plumed Serpent consistent with that he later took in Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays, maintaining that Lawrence used the character Ram√≥n to depict \\"the attainment of an integrated personality\\". He compared the novel to the poet T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land (1922), observing that both works juxtaposed \\"past and present\\". Donna Przybylowicz maintained that the novel revealed a conflict between contradictory fascist and liberal humanist tendencies within Lawrence's work. She compared Lawrence to Leavis and Eliot, suggesting that like Eliot, Lawrence believed that \\"all crises of a capitalistic post-war society of class-conflict could be transcended by ignoring history and replacing it with myth\\", although with the difference that Eliot's views were Christian and Lawrence's \\"paganistic\\". She argued that The Plumed Serpent, by depicting the proletariat and Indian peasants as needing to be controlled by a dictatorial leader, revealed Lawrence as \\"basically anti-democratic and anti-socialist\\", and that it also presented a \\"Western stereotyped notion\\" of \\"the dark races\\" as \\"lazy, dirty, resentful, covetous, irresponsible, and aimless\\". She believed that Lawrence \\"correctly portrays the crisis of Mexican society as resulting from reification and social fragmentation\\", but criticised him for repudiating \\"revolutionary political change\\" and wanting to maintain class divisions. Lydia Blanchard described the novel as \\"puzzling\\", and wrote that it was \\"infrequently admired even by Lawrence admirers\\", with most readers finding it flawed, due to its \\"turgid\\" language, \\"wooden\\" characters, and \\"improbable\\" plot. She observed that it had been seen as a \\"prelude to fascism\\". Karen McLeod Hewitt described the novel as \\"unpleasant nonsense\\", writing that most of it celebrated \\"a disgust for people which is also pretentious.\\" However, she praised the \\"brief passages\\" in which Leslie's reactions to the cruelties of Mexico were \\"dramatized with passion\\" and showed respect for the character. David Carroll maintained that compared to its early version Quetzalcoatl, the novel's published version showed \\"more intimate knowledge of Mexican culture\\" and explored \\"the confrontation of white and red consciousness\\" with greater complexity. Jad Smith wrote that The Plumed Serpent is often regarded as \\"the height of Lawrence‚Äôs interest in authoritarian politics\\" and was a \\"notorious instance of Lawrence‚Äôs proto-fascist leanings\\". However, he noted that Lawrence subsequently wrote letters, including one to Bynner, \\"that appear to repudiate his leadership vision\\". He argued that they did not represent a change in Lawrence's views, and stressed that Lawrence did not necessarily endorse fascist politics, despite the presence of \\"proto-fascist ideologies\\" in the novel and its racism. He also argued that it reflected \\"Lawrence‚Äôs familiarity with German thought and culture\\". Duane Edwards described the novel as Lawrence's \\"most profound expression of what the human psyche is\\", and suggested that it prepared the way for Lawrence's later novel Lady Chatterley's Lover. He maintained that it was disturbing because it \\"makes readers aware of their primitive, pre-conscious self, which connects them with their most ancient ancestors\\". He observed that the novel had received a more negative response than any other work by Lawrence, finding it surprising that it had \\"so many detractors.\\" He disputed the characterisation of the work as racist and fascist, maintaining that Lawrence's views should not be confused with those of his characters Cipriano and Ram√≥n. Julianne Newmark compared the novel to Willa Cather's The Professor's House (1925), arguing that both were inspired by \\"engagement with evocative American places‚Äîspecifically the high deserts and rugged expanses of the American southwest\\" and are concerned with \\"the ways place constitutes new identities.\\" She questioned the charge that The Plumed Serpent is racist and that Lawrence's views resembled those of \\"white supremacists\\". Damien Barlow wrote that \\"a queer approach to reading Lawrence's modernist fiction\\" has been proposed. Armando Pereira maintained that the novel reflected Lawrence's desire to \\"live in a creative way and free of the oppressive rationality, anxiety of technique and obsession of progress that had swallowed Europe up.\\" Nora Marisa Le√≥n-Real M√©ndez argued that Lawrence \\"confers significant meaning to the landmarks, constructing a narrative space that is particular as well as linked to the Mexico outside the text.\\" Camelia Raghinaru argued that there was a connection between Lawrence's interest in the Kabbalah, which may have developed from his reading, early in the 20th century, of the occultist, and founder of the Theosophical Society, Helena Blavatsky, and his development of a \\"messianic utopia\\" in The Plumed Serpent. She saw the novel as dealing with \\"magical and mystical secrets whose purpose is to enact a messianic eschatology\\" and believed that it revealed Lawrence's preoccupation with \\"femininity and its mystical significance.\\" She wrote that Lawrence saw The Plumed Serpent as \\"a magical incantation\\" intended to \\"change the world\\". She interpreted the novel in terms of the philosopher Julia Kristeva's emphasis on abjection in Powers of Horror (1980), and maintained that it emphasised \\"male sexuality and female submission\\". Luis G√≥mez Romero compared the novel to Kangaroo, writing that in both works Lawrence, \\"exposes the advent of discrete crises resulting from the failure of human ideals and institutions to prevent and tame violence.\\" He noted that critics had often regarded the work as a \\"direct expression of Lawrence‚Äôs proto-fascist propensities.\\" He questioned the view that its plot had little to do with actual Mexican politics, arguing that it should be viewed \\"in a specifically Mexican context.\\" He also observed that the early reception of The Plumed Serpent in Mexico was positive, citing the views of the newspaper Exc√©lsior and the poet Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano, who both credited Lawrence with understanding Mexico and the Mexicans. He also noted the similar appreciative views of the intellectual Antonio Castro Leal and the poet Octavio Paz. However, he stated that \\"Mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and the rise of post-colonial studies\\" later displaced such positive views of the novel in Mexico. He noted the poet Jos√© Juan Tablada's accusation of plagiarism against Lawrence, but discounted it, writing that The Plumed Serpent had little in common with Tablada's La Resurrecci√≥n de los √çdolos (1924). Vladimiro Rivas Iturralde maintained that Lawrence wrote about \\"the transformation of man in myth\\" in an \\"improbable way\\" and that The Plumed Serpent was an \\"artistic failure.\\" Debra A. Castillo compared the novel to the anthropologist Tobias Schneebaum's Keep the River on Your Right (1969) and the work of the intellectual Georges Bataille. She maintained that it \\"stands out among the hundreds of novels and stories written by Anglo-Americans and set in Mexico for the particular forcefulness of Lawrence's obsession with, and equally forceful rejection of, that country and its people.\\" She considered the work racist, and deemed it unsurprising that Lawrence considered it his best novel, arguing that he did so because he found Mexico, as a foreign society, an ideal subject on which to project his personal \\"obsessions\\". Nevertheless, she believed that the novel contained valuable insights into the state of Mexico after the Mexican Revolution. She noted that of those Mexican writers who had discussed the novel, the poet Jos√© Emilio Pacheco warned against its \\"proto-fascism\\", while Paz praised its \\"depiction of landscape\\". David Barnes noted that while Lawrence regarded the novel as his most important, he made little reference to it after its publication, and that it is usually held that he later rejected its themes for new concerns in the late 1920s, expressed in works such as Lady Chatterley's Lover. He criticised the novel's \\"misogyny\\", \\"authoritarian politics\\", and \\"racial essentialism\\", but nevertheless saw it as part of an important \\"political debate about what forms of nationhood might emerge in the 1920s\\" and showed awareness of \\"the possibilities of nation as utopian community.\\" He maintained that while Bynner's negative judgment of the novel, expressed in his memoir Journeys with Genius, had affected its reputation, Lawrence was more interested in \\"Mexican revolutionary culture\\" than Bynner's comments suggested. He argued that the novel's themes were to some extent similar to those of Lady Chatterley's Lover. He also compared the novel to Kangaroo and Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays. Shirley Bricourt argued that episodes in the novel such as the bullfight scene depict rites that both \\"act as catalysers of emotions\\" and \\"travesty these emotions as a submissive but passionate response.\\" She compared the novel to Kangaroo. Juliette Feyel compared The Plumed Serpent to Kangaroo, describing them as Lawrence's \\"most explicitly political novels\\". She compared both work's to Civilization and Its Discontents (1930), by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, maintaining that Lawrence and Freud both \\"correlate individual neurosis with civilization.\\" See also * Aztec mythology in popular culture * Fascism * Mornings in Mexico * Polytheistic reconstructionism References =Bibliography= ;Books          * ;Journals        * ;Online articles * *  External links  * V√∂lkisch Organicism and the Use of Primitivism in Lawrence‚Äôs The Plumed Serpent Category:1926 British novels Category:Alfred A.

Some notable features of the area are the Brighton-Seacliff Yacht Club, the Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club, the Brighton Jetty, and a beach. The Windsor Theatre constructed in 1925 is a long-standing institution, showing cinema to the locals usually two films per night. History People on the beach at Brighton in South Australia in 1930. Brighton Post Office opened on 27 August 1849. Brighton Jetty Post Office opened on 1 March 1950 and closed in 1979. Brighton municipal building, completed in 1937, was formerly the (second) Brighton Town Hall and is now one of two City of Holdfast Bay municipal offices. Brighton became the seat of a newly-formed municipality, the Corporate Town of Brighton, in 1858. The first Brighton Town Hall was built in 1869 and was just the fourth Town Hall built in the colony of South Australia. The architect and builder was George William Highet who arrived in the colony in 1836 and served as a town clerk and inaugural councillor. He died in Brighton aged 80 years. The hall was constructed of stone from Ayliffe‚Äôs quarry in the Adelaide Hills laid on concrete foundations.Conservation Management Plan for Former Brighton Town Hall, Flightpath Architects, 2009. It was used as the civic centre of the City of Brighton from 1869 until 1936 when it was then leased by the RSL. The second town hall was opened in 1937, at 24 Jetty Road, and still fulfils a civic administration purpose. Brighton was the home of Australian geologist, Antarctic explorer and academic Sir Douglas Mawson. He was buried at St Jude's Church Cemetery in the suburb. North Brighton Cemetery nearby, at 301 Brighton Road, is the \\"last resting place\\" of Catherine Helen Spence and her brother J. B. Spence, Pat Glennon and Paul Moran. Overview Brighton has a large sandy beach which is patrolled by the Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club on Weekends and Public Holidays between November and March. Brighton Beach is popular for Adelaide beach goers as it is relatively safe - currently rated as Least Hazardous by Surf Lifesaving. A \\"Stormy Session\\" by the Brighton jetty A sand replenishment program has been in operation for many years resulting in the beach sand dunes gradually increasing through the program of replacing eroded sand and replanting of the dunes with plants and grasses. In summer, a sandbar normally forms in the water which can produce waves on windy days. Brighton is well known by local surfers for producing messy but fun 'stormy sessions'. The Esplanade is an area of prime real estate which has been transformed over the years from a street of old cottages to new modern town houses. Brighton's Jetty Road runs perpendicular to the Esplanade and is home to many restaurants, cafes and the local hotel, known as \\"The Esplanade\\", or \\"Espy\\". Brighton jetty The first Brighton Jetty was built in 1886 and weathered the sea and storms for over 100 years. The Brighton jetty was badly damaged by winter storms in the 1994. The jetty was rebuilt using funds supplied by a mobile phone (cell phone) service provider, hence the tower on the end of the jetty. In 1926 the women of Brighton erected a drinking fountain near the entrance of the jetty to commemorate the death of Kathleen Duncan Whyte, who was fatally attacked by a shark while swimming. Kitty was the daughter of Rev. Maculley and taught swimming at Brighton for many years. In 1919 Kitty saved a swimmer from drowning and was awarded a Grand Diploma by the Royal Life Saving Society. At the shore end of the jetty is a War Memorial arch. Here, traditional Dawn Services are held annually on Anzac Day to commemorate fallen service men and women.

It uses a roller-delayed blowback system similar to the H&K; G3 and CETME rifles. The SIG SG 510-1 entered service in the Swiss Army with the designation F. ass. 57 (French/Italian, for Fusil d'Assault 57/Fucile d' Assalto 57) or Stgw. 57 (German for Sturmgewehr 57). The Sturmgewehr 57/SIG SG 510-1 was adopted for Swiss military service in 1957 and was, in 1990, replaced by the lighter SIG SG 550, although some reservists used it for several more years. Design details The SG 510 is derived from the AM55 developed during the late 1950s. During its development Rudolf Amsler was the principal designer at Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft. It is a selective fire rifle that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. As with all roller-delayed designs, the roller recesses in the receiver will eventually wear down, and begin to increase the cartridge headspace. Many roller-delayed blowback weapons accept this as the functional service life of the rifle, but the SIG 510 has interchangeable locking recesses, so they can be replaced when worn. The Stgw. 57 was used by the Swiss Army as a personal universal weapon. In Swiss service it replaced the K31 rifle, the Suomi M-31 submachine gun and the Lmg 25 magazine fed light machine gun. =Features= Stgw 57 with folded down iron sights on its bipod set in the rear position. The weapon is mainly made of pressed sheet-metal components to ease mass production and incorporates the \\"straight-line\\" recoil configuration. This layout, placed both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the bore, a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire. The SG 510 has a distinctive T-shaped bolt handle similar to the earlier K31 rifle. For recoil reduction the fixed butt-stock was designed with durability in mind and is fitted with a recoil buffer to cope with the recoil produced by heavy rifle grenades in use by the Swiss military. The SG 510-1/Stgw. 57 sports a large carrying handle at its balance point that can be used during quick position changes or on the march. The butt-stock and hand guard of the SG 510-1/Stgw 57 are molded out of solid rubber for comfort and the front hand guard is ribbed to provide a better grip. =Barrel= The SG 510-1/Stgw 57 barrel is relatively thick and rifled along of its length and has a 270 mm (1 in 10.6 in) 4 groove rifling. At the end of the barrel an integral long muzzle brake/flash hider is fitted that reduces recoil by about 25%. The total length barrel and muzzle device also functions as rifle grenade spigot. The barrel is surrounded by a perforated tubular barrel jacket with two spring detents for a sliding, underfolding integrated bipod‚Äîone near the muzzle to reduce shot dispersion during automatic fire, and another nearer the receiver and balance point offering more flexibility in the rifle role. The Stgw. 57 bipod legs are marked for use as an inclinometer for aiming rifle grenades at various ranges with and without an additional booster-charged rifle grenade. For such indirect rifle grenade fire, the Stgw. 57 was set on the ground and a weighted string attached near the muzzle was used as a plumb-line to set the correct firing angle reference mark on the bipod leg. Swiss army knives were often used as a makeshift plumb bob at the end of the string. =Trigger mechanism= The trigger mechanism has a three-position fire selector switch that is also the manual safety toggle that secures the weapon from accidentally discharging. The user selects the operating mode with a large side lever on the left side of the receiver that can be rotated to select S (safe), E (semi-automatic fire) or M (full-automatic fire). On the right hand side of the rifle, there is a foldaway 'winter' trigger which enables the operator to use the rifle with arctic mittens. It is also used for rifle grenade firing to avoid recoil induced hand injuries. =Sights= Swiss Army Stgw 57 with erected iron sights and mounted bayonet The SG 510-1/Stgw. 57 has a straight-line stock design, and an elevated iron sights line with a relatively long sight radius. Both the front and rear sights can be folded down when not in use. The rear peep sight of the Stgw. 57 can be adjusted from . From the sight adjusts in increments. From in increments, and from in increments.Swiss Army Sturmgewehr 57 Manual (German) According to the Swiss Army the 50% windage and elevation dispersion shot at 300 m from a machine rest averages 6 cm (2.4 in). The employed circular error probable method cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy. When the R50 results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%. For anti-personnel use, the SG 510-1/Stgw. 57 typical maximum range for consistent accuracy is . For designated marksman use, the SG 510 can be equipped with a quick- detachable Kern 4√ó24 telescopic sight. The sight weighs and includes a variety of features, such as mounting components, a Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) elevation adjustment knob for ranges from 100 to 800 m, an illuminated reticle that enables target acquisition in low-light conditions and a diopter eyesight correction adjustment. Included with the sight is a lens hood for mounting on the ocular that reduces image quality-impairing stray light and a gray filter for glare reduction.Kern 4x24 telescopic sight A night vision sight with an infra red light can also be mounted. The Chilean version can fit a German-made Supra 4√ó24 telescopic sight. =Accessories= Stgw 57 with mounted dummy Gewehrgranaten 58 rifle grenade The Swiss Army Stgw 57 is fed from curved detachable box magazines, made from aluminum and containing 24 rounds weighing empty and fully loaded. Special silver coloured magazines that can contain 6 Gewehr- Treibpatronen 44 grenade-launching cartridges for use with rifle grenades weigh empty and fully loaded. The PE 57 had 5- and 10-round magazines available as well. Magazines with 20-round capacities for the 510-4 in 7.62 NATO and 30-round originally for the LMG 25 may operate in the Stgw. 57 as well. Other accessories include the sling, the bayonet, and a special small- capacity magazine for grenade-launching cartridges. Rifle grenades can be launched without adding a special provision. Grenade-launching cartridges enable the SG 510-1/Stgw. 57 to fire Gewehrgranaten 58 rifle grenades which weigh depending on the warhead type. The rifle grenade 58 achieves a muzzle velocity of and a maximum range of without the help of a booster charge or and a maximum range of with the help of a booster charge. The rifle grenade 58 may be fitted with the following warheads: * Hollow charge for heavy armor (direct fired only). Modern hollow charge rifle grenades can penetrate of \\"best quality\\" armour plating. * Anti-personnel fragmentation with impact detonator (direct or indirect fired). * Smoke canister for reducing visibility (direct or indirect fired). * Practice (inert orange rubber) Civilian use Upon completion of their military service, members of the Swiss armed forces could obtain ownership of their personal Stgw. 57 rifle by paying an administrative fee. These \\"civilianised\\" Stgw 57 rifles were converted to a semiautomatic only configuration. Dedicated factory-built, semiautomatic only rifles for private purchase were available and designated PE 57, PE means Privat Einzelfeuer (Private Singlefire). These civilian PE 57 rifles incorporate subtle design changes to avoid some cross-compatibility with army rifle parts. As of 2007, around 40 percent of discharged soldiers choose to retain their weapon (nowadays the SIG SG 550), and the going rate for civilianised SG 510 rifles on the private weapons market is reported to vary between 300 and 500 Swiss francs. In Switzerland the SG 510 is also used for target shooting matches. For this the standard iron sights can be replaced by target shooting diopter and globe sight sighting lines. When the original sighting is kept Swiss sport shooters refer to a such unmodified rifle as Stgw 57/02 (small diopter allowed, but no globe sight). When a globe sight is added and possibly the sighting line radius is lengthened by mounting the globe sight nearer to the muzzle it is referred to as Stgw 57/03. As of 2017 the original military barrels (extremely long lasting: up to 25'000 rounds) could be replaced by so called match barrels similar to those used in standard single shot match rifles. Other upgrades include the tightening of the rifle in general, a lighter hammer, custom pistol grip and barrel jacket and regularly replacing the worn parts of the lock. A completely upgraded Stgw 57/03 almost equals a standard rifle in precision (results of 95% are common) and sells for 3500-4000 Swiss Francs. SG 510-4 7.62√ó51mm NATO variant SG 510-4 rifle chambered in 7.62√ó51mm NATO The SG 510-4 chambered in 7.62√ó51mm NATO with a 305 mm (1 in 12 in) twist rate barrel was adopted by Chile and Bolivia. The SIG SG 510 is officially classed as an automatic rifle but served as a designated marksman weapon (in Chile with Supra 4√ó24 scope). Variants * 510-1: Standard Swiss service rifle. * 510-2: Lightened variant of the standard rifle.Stgw. 57 / Sig 510 assault rifle (Switzerland) . Modern Firearms. Accessed 15 August 2009. * 510-3: 7.62√ó39mm variant with shorter barrel. This was produced in small numbers as a prototype and offered to the Finnish Army. They did not want it, hence, this model of the rifle was never mass-produced. * 510-4: 7.62√ó51mm NATO variant used by Bolivia and Chile. This version uses a shorter barrel and a buttstock made from wood rather than rubber. Overall length is much less than the Stgw 57 with a subsequently lower weight. The buttstock is angled downward rather than straight inline with the receiver. * AMT: semi-automatic only variant of the 510-4 imported into the United States in relatively small numbers. It was available in .308 (7.62√ó51). \\"AMT\\" stood for \\"American Match Target\\". It was equipped with fine wooden furniture and a rounded upper handguard. *510-5: .30-06 Springfield (7.62√ó63mm) experimental rifle made for testing by the Mexican Government. *510-6: 7.5√ó55mm Swiss test batch of rifles based on the 510-4 in the Swiss military caliber intended to replace the heavier Stgw 57. The rifles were only built for testing and didn't win the contract as a replacement. The contract went to the SIG 550 rifle which became known as the Stgw 90. * SIG PE 57: (Privat Einzelfeuer) semi-automatic only civilian version available in 7.5√ó55mm GP 11 Swiss. This variant is not the same as privatised former Swiss Army service rifles. It was specifically built as a semi auto only rifle along the lines of the Stgw 57 with which it is frequently confused. While over 700,000 of the Stgw 57s were built for military use less than 5000 PE57s were made. Users *: 510-4 variant.Jones, Richard D. Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009/2010.

It is about north-east of Glasgow city centre and south of Kirkintilloch. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 8,873. United Kingdom Census 2011 The ancient barony of Lenzie was held by William de Comyn, Baron of Lenzie and Lord of Cumbernauld in the 12th century. Toponymy Lenzie is now generally pronounced with a /z/, but used to be pronounced /l…õnj…™/. This is because the original Scots spelling, Len»ùie, contained the letter yogh, which was later confused with the tailed z.Scottish Language Dictionaries: Dictionary of the Scots Language, The name probably derives from the Gaelic L√®anaidh (), a locative form of l√®ana, meaning a \\"wet meadow\\". The whole parish was split into Easter Lenzie which now contains for example Lenziemill, and Wester Lenzie which came to be dominated by Kirkintilloch. History Lenzie, as a town, was built in the 19th century as a commuter town for those travelling to Glasgow and Edinburgh, as Lenzie railway station is a stop between the two cities. The train station was originally named 'Kirkintilloch Junction' and later 'Campsie Junction', pages 52, 136 & 141. as it was a junction between the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway and its Campsie branch line through Kirkintilloch (the latter line no longer exists). Lenzie, the 'wet plain'Johnstone, Fiona (1982). Place Names. Edinburgh: Spur Books. . had been used for farming. Lenzie Moss, a boggy, marshy area of Lenzie that has not been built on, has peat bogs, which were extensively exploited and now feature the characteristics of peat cutting, and several acres of deciduous woodland mainly made up of silver birch. The area is a sanctuary for wildlife, including rabbits, deer, and foxes. On older maps Lenzie Moss was referred to as \\"mountain moss\\". The Lenzie Peat Railway was a narrow gauge railway which ran on Lenzie Moss serving the peat trade. Woodilee Hospital opened in 1874 but was gradually closed down from the mid-1990s. Lenzie Hospital for the elderly also closed around this time. Until World War II, housing was chiefly north of the railway station and south of the railway on the west side of Auchinloch Road. This consisted of Victorian and Edwardian villas, a few terraces, and some 1920s and 1930s bungalows at Middlemuir and Kirkintilloch Road in north Lenzie. From the 1950s some Council housing was built at Gallowhill Avenue and High Gallowhill as well as private housing. In the south, housing was built at Millersneuk and Claddens, changing the image and the face of the village into a town. Now it has several shops, schools, churches, parks, and various sport clubs like any other suburb. Schools The main secondary school for the town is Lenzie Academy,which was founded in 1886 and was originally both a primary and secondary school situated on Kirkintilloch Road, Lenzie - later Lenzie Primary School. In 1960, the school moved to its present building on Myrtle Avenue, and became purely a secondary school. Between the 1970s and the 2010s there were four primary schools in Lenzie: Lenzie Moss, Lenzie Primary, Millersneuk and Holy Family. Lenzie Primary was the oldest of the primary schools, and was the former Lenzie Academy building. It became a school for primary education only when the Lenzie Academy building was built in 1960. The second oldest, Lenzie Moss Primary was opened in 1968 and was located next to \\"The Moss\\". Millersneuk Primary School was built in 1979, and celebrated its 25th Anniversary with a school concert in Summer 2004. Holy Family Primary is a Catholic school situated on the border of Lenzie and Kirkintilloch. Schools in the area operated below capacity for some time and in 2010 a review of East Dunbartonshire Council's non-secondary school estate recommended that Lenzie Primary be closed and pupils rezoned to Millersneuk and Lenzie Moss. It was decided that Lenzie Moss and Lenzie Primary would merge and be located in a new building on the Lenzie Moss site. The new primary school was named Lenzie Meadow after a vote. Life There are four churches in Lenzie: Lenzie Union Parish Church and Lenzie Old Parish Church (both Church of Scotland), St Cyprian's (Scottish Episcopal Church), and Lenzie Christian Fellowship (a non- denominational congregation). St Cyprian's, a category B listed building, is the oldest of the churches - established in 1873St Cyprian's and celebrated its 125th anniversary in the year 1998. Lenzie Old Parish Church designed by architects Clark & Bell, and was built in 1874. Lenzie Old is a category C listed building. Every year Lenzie holds a Gala on the first Saturday in June in the grounds of the local Lenzie Rugby Club. Each year, a 'Queen' in Primary Seven is chosen from one of the local primary schools, and three attendants from the other schools. There is one Scout Group the 1st Lenzie, 12th Glasgow. The group was set up in 1908 by Robert Warnock and is now one of the largest in the Clyde area. It was among the first to establish cubs and beaver sections. It has a successfully running beaver cub and scout sections and also includes the Pegasus explorer unit. In addition there is one Boys' Brigade Company: 1st Lenzie BB, founded on 10 January 1964 by the Captain, Tom Carey (attached to Lenzie Union Parish Church (LUPC)). The BB in Lenzie has three growing sections for boys aged 5 ‚Äì 18 years and celebrated its 50th Anniversary in May 2014. The former 2nd Lenzie BB (attached to Lenzie Old Parish Church), became defunct in the early 2000s. LUPC which also nurtures Lenzie Crusaders. =Shops= They are a number of shops in Lenzie, which include two Co-Operatives, Rasoi (Indian), Da Carlos (Fish and Chips), The Grove (Pub), U-save (Shop), Billingtons (Deli), Andrew King Opticians, Cornucopia Beauty, and Town and Country (Estate Agents). Sport  Lenzie Youth Club has catered for youth football and other activities within the village since its foundation in 1980. LYC football teams have won three Scottish Youth FA Cup competitions - in 1987, 1997 and 2007. Former players include Scotland and Aston Villa midfielder Barry Bannan and Scotland and Blackpool defender Stephen Crainey. Lenzie Rugby Club plays in the Scottish Regional West League Division One. The club is thought to have formed in 1897. Established in 1889, Lenzie Golf Club is situated at the east end of the Gadloch and is often flooded by the loch. Lenzie F.C.(formed in 1875) were a senior Scottish football club that participated in the early years of the Scottish Cup, with minor success until its last outing in the 1886-87 season, where they lost 13-0 at home to Vale of Leven. In 1879, the club took part in a demonstration game at the Ulster Cricket Ground against a scratch team of local players in one of the earliest competitive football matches held in Northern Ireland. The nearest hockey club is Stepps H.C. The club competes in the second tier or the Scottish national leagues (2009/10 season) and has had a successful history.

In 1563, he married Jane Howard, daughter of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and Frances de Vere, Countess of Surrey. She was the sister of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. A Catholic by upbringing, and allied to the Catholic Howard family, Westmorland opposed Queen Elizabeth I's Protestant policies and, in November 1569 he joined Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland in the Northern Rebellion against the Queen. The rebels captured Durham, and held a Catholic mass. Forces loyal to the queen mustered and crushed the rebellion, which failed in its attempt to rescue Mary, Queen of Scots from prison. The two earls escaped to Scotland. Westmorland found protection and concealment for a long time at Fernyhurst Castle, Lord Kerr's house in Roxburghshire, but meanwhile the Earl's cousin, Robert Constable, was hired by Sir Ralph Sadler to endeavour to track the unfortunate nobleman, and under the guise of friendship to betray him. Constable's correspondence appears among the Sadler State papers ‚Äì an infamous memorial of treachery and baseness. After Northumberland had been captured and turned over to Elizabeth in 1572, Westmorland feared a similar betrayal and left for Flanders, where he suffered the extremity of poverty. He would never see his wife, Jane Howard (died 1593) and their son and four daughters again. His vast inheritance was confiscated; Brancepeth, the stronghold of the Nevilles in war, and Raby, their festive Hall in peace, had passed into strangers' hands. A spy-report sent from Paris to London in August 1585 states that Charles Neville, the fugitive Earl of Westmorland, might, as part of a concerted Catholic invasion of England, land in Cumberland or Lancashire, bringing with him the son or sons of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. Historians are obliged to wonder which son(s) the report means, as sources indicate that all sons were in England at the time of their father's mysterious death (possibly murder, possibly suicide) in 1585. In 1588, Westmorland commanded a force of 700 English fugitives in the seaports of Flanders, who with the army of 103 companies of foot and 4000 horse, making together 30,000 men under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma; and besides 12,000 men brought by the Duke of Guise to the coast of Normandy, intended for an attack on the West of England, under cover and protection of the Spanish Armada. Westmorland fled, to live in exile on the Continent; he was attainted by Parliament in 1571 (Act 13 Eliz. I c. 16). He survived on a small pension from Philip II of Spain, dying penniless and largely forgotten on 16 November 1601.

SDO is conceptualized under social dominance theory as a measure of individual differences in levels of group-based discrimination; that is, it is a measure of an individual's preference for hierarchy within any social system and the domination over lower-status groups. It is a predisposition toward anti-egalitarianism within and between groups. The concept of SDO as a measurable individual difference is a product of social dominance theory. Individuals who score high in SDO desire to maintain and, in many cases, increase the differences between social statuses of different groups, as well as individual group members. Typically, they are dominant, driven, tough, and seekers of power. People high in SDO also prefer hierarchical group orientations. Often, people who score high in SDO adhere strongly to belief in a \\"dog-eat-dog\\" world. It has also been found that men are generally higher than women in SDO measures.Forsyth, D.R. (2009). Ground Dynamics: New York: Wadsworth [Chapter 7] Studies have found that SDO has a strong positive relationship with authoritarian and racist beliefs. Social dominance theory SDO was first proposed by Jim Sidanius and Felicia Pratto as part of their social dominance theory (SDT). SDO is the key measurable component of SDT that is specific to it. SDT begins with the empirical observation that surplus-producing social systems have a threefold group-based hierarchy structure: age-based, gender-based and \\"arbitrary set-based\\", which can include race, class, sexual orientation, caste, ethnicity, religious affiliation, etc. Age-based hierarchies invariably give more power to adults and middle-age people than children and younger adults, and gender-based hierarchies invariably grant more power to one gender over others, but arbitrary-set hierarchies‚Äîthough quite resilient‚Äîare truly arbitrary. SDT is based on three primary assumptions: #While age- and gender-based hierarchies will tend to exist within all social systems, arbitrary-set systems of social hierarchy will invariably emerge within social systems producing sustainable economic surpluses. #Most forms of group conflict and oppression (e.g., racism, homophobia, ethnocentrism, sexism, classism, regionalism) can be regarded as different manifestations of the same basic human predisposition to form group-based hierarchies. #Human social systems are subject to the counterbalancing influences of hierarchy-enhancing (HE) forces, producing and maintaining ever higher levels of group-based social inequality, and hierarchy-attenuating (HA) forces, producing greater levels of group-based social equality. SDO is the individual attitudinal aspect of SDT. It is influenced by group status, socialization, and temperament. In turn, it influences support for HE and HA \\"legitimating myths\\", defined as \\"values, attitudes, beliefs, causal attributions and ideologies\\" that in turn justify social institutions and practices that either enhance or attenuate group hierarchy. Early development While the correlation of gender with SDO scores has been empirically measured and confirmed, the impact of temperament and socialization is less clear. Duckitt has suggested a model of attitude development for SDO, suggesting that unaffectionate socialisation in childhood causes a tough-minded attitude. According to Duckitt's model, people high in tough-minded personality are predisposed to view the world as a competitive place in which resource competition is zero-sum. A desire to compete, which fits with social dominance orientation, influences in-group and outside-group attitudes. People high in SDO also believe that hierarchies are present in all aspects of society and are more likely to agree with statements such as \\"It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom\\". Scale SDO has been measured by a series of scales that have been refined over time, all of which contain a balance of pro- and contra-trait statements or phrases. A 7-point Likert scale is used for each item; participants rate their agreement or disagreement with the statements from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Most of the research was conducted with the SDO-5 (a 14-point scale) and SDO-6. The SDO-7 scale is the most recent scale measuring social dominance orientation, which embeds two sub-dimensions: dominance (SDO-D) and anti-egalitarianism (SDO-E). = SDO-7 items =  Dominance Sub-Scale  # Some groups of people must be kept in their place. # It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom. # An ideal society requires some groups to be on top and others to be on the bottom. # Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups. # Groups at the bottom are just as deserving as groups at the top. (reverse-scored) # No one group should dominate in society. (reverse-scored) # Groups at the bottom should not have to stay in their place. (reverse-scored) # Group dominance is a poor principle. (reverse-scored)  Anti-Egalitarianism Sub-Scale  # We should not push for group equality. # We shouldn't try to guarantee that every group has the same quality of life. # It is unjust to try to make groups equal. # Group equality should not be our primary goal. # We should work to give all groups an equal chance to succeed. (reverse-scored) # We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups. (reverse-scored) # No matter how much effort it takes, we ought to strive to ensure that all groups have the same chance in life. (reverse-scored) # Group equality should be our ideal. (reverse-scored) = SDO-16 items= # Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups. # In getting what you want, it is sometimes necessary to use force against other groups. # It's OK if some groups have more of a chance in life than others. # To get ahead in life, it is sometimes necessary to step on other groups. # If certain groups stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems. # It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom. # Inferior groups should stay in their place. # Sometimes other groups must be kept in their place. # It would be good if groups could be equal. (reverse-scored) # Group equality should be our ideal. (reverse-scored) # All groups should be given an equal chance in life. (reverse-scored) # We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups. (reverse-scored) # Increased social equality is beneficial to society. (reverse-scored) # We would have fewer problems if we treated people more equally. (reverse-scored) # We should strive to make incomes as equal as possible. (reverse-scored) # No group should dominate in society. (reverse-scored) Keying is reversed on questions 9 through 16, to control for acquiescence bias. Criticisms of the construct Rubin and Hewstone (2004) argue that social dominance research has changed its focus dramatically over the years, and these changes have been reflected in different versions of the social dominance orientation construct. Social dominance orientation was originally defined as \\"the degree to which individuals desire social dominance and superiority for themselves and their primordial groups over other groups\\" (p. 209). It then quickly changed to not only \\"(a) a‚Ä¶desire for and value given to in-group dominance over out-groups\\" but also \\"(b) the desire for nonegalitarian, hierarchical relationships between groups within the social system\\" (p. 1007). The most recent measure of social dominance orientation (see SDO-6 above) focuses on the \\"general desire for unequal relations among social groups, regardless of whether this means ingroup domination or ingroup subordination\\" (p. 312). Given these changes, Rubin and Hewstone believe that evidence for social dominance theory should be considered \\"as supporting three separate SDO hypotheses, rather than one single theory\\" (p. 22). Group-based and individual dominance Robert Altemeyer said that people with a high SDO want more power (agreeing with items such as \\"Winning is more important than how you play the game\\") and are higher on Machiavellianism. These observations are at odds with conceptualisations of SDO as a group-based phenomenon, suggesting that the SDO reflects interpersonal dominance, not only group-based dominance. This is supported by Sidanius and Pratto's own evidence that high-SDO individuals tend to gravitate toward hierarchy-enhancing jobs and institutions, such as law enforcement, that are themselves hierarchically structured vis-a-vis individuals within them. Relations with other personality traits =Connection with right wing authoritarianism= SDO correlates weakly with right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) (r ‚âà .18). Both predict attitudes, such as sexist, racist, and heterosexist attitudes. The two contribute to different forms of prejudice; SDO correlates to higher prejudice against subordinate and disadvantaged groups, RWA correlates to higher prejudice against threatening groups, while both are associated with increases in prejudice for \\"dissident\\" groups. SDO and RWA contribute to prejudice in an additive rather than interactive way (the interaction of SDO and RWA accounted, in one study, for an average of less than .001% variance in addition to their linear combination), that is the association between SDO and prejudice is similar regardless of a person's level of RWA, and vice versa. Crawford et al. (2013) found that RWA and SDO differentially predicted interpretations of media reports about socially threatening (for example, gays and lesbians) and disadvantaged groups (for example, African Americans), respectively. Subjects with high SDO, but not RWA, scores reacted positively to articles and authors that opposed affirmative action, and negatively to pro-affirmative-action article content. Moreover, RWA, but not SDO, predicted subjects' evaluations of same-sex relationships, such that high-RWA individuals favored anti-same- sex relationships article content and low-RWA individuals favorably rated pro- same-sex relationships content. =Correlation with Big Five personality traits= Studies on the relationship of SDO with the higher order Big Five personality traits have associated high SDO with lower openness to experience and lower agreeableness. Meta-analytic aggregation of these studies indicates that the association with low Agreeableness is more robust than the link to Openness to experience. Individuals low in Agreeableness are more inclined to report being motivated by self-interest and self-indulgence. They also tend to be more self-centred and are more 'tough-minded' compared to those who are high on Agreeableness, leading them to perceive the world to be a highly competitive place, where the way to success is through power and dominance ‚Äì all of which predict SDO. Low Openness, by contrast, aligns more strongly with RWA; thinking in clear and straightforward moral codes that dictate how society as a system should function. Being low in Openness prompts the individual to value security, stability and control: fundamental elements of RWA.  Facet-level associations  In case of SDO all five facets of Agreeableness significantly correlate (negatively), even after controlling for RWA. 'Tough-mindedness' (opposite of tender-mindedness' facet) is the strongest predictor of SDO. After the effect of SDO is controlled for, only one facet of agreeableness is predictive of RWA. Facets also distinguish SDO from RWA, with 'Dominators' (individuals high on SDO), but not 'Authoritarians' (individuals who score high on RWA), having been found to be lower in dutifulness, morality, sympathy and co-operation. RWA is also associated with religiosity, conservativism, righteousness, and, to some extent, a conscientious moral code, which distinguishes RWA from SDO. = Empathy = SDO is inversely related to empathy. Facets of Agreeableness that are linked to altruism, sympathy and compassion are the strongest predictors of SDO. SDO has been suggested to have a link with callous affect (which is to be found on the psychopathy sub-scale), the 'polar opposite' of empathy. The relationship between SDO and (lack of) empathy has been found to be reciprocal ‚Äì with equivocal findings. Some studies show that empathy significantly impacts SDO, whereas other research suggest the opposite effect is more robust; that SDO predicts empathy. The latter showcases how powerful of a predictor SDO may be, not only affecting individual's certain behaviours, but potentially influencing upstream the proneness to those behaviours. It also suggests that those scoring high on SDO proactively avoid scenarios that could prompt them to be more empathetic or tender-minded. This avoidance decreases concern for other's welfare. Empathy indirectly affects generalized prejudice through its negative relationship with SDO. It also has a direct effect on generalized prejudice, as lack of empathy makes one unable to put oneself in the other person's shoes, which predicts prejudice and antidemocratic views. Some recent research has suggested the relationship between SDO and empathy may be more complex, arguing that people with high levels of SDO are less likely to show empathy towards low status people but more likely to show it towards high status people. Conversely, people with low SDO levels demonstrate the reverse behaviour.Lucas, Brian J., and Nour S. Kteily. \\"(Anti-) egalitarianism differentially predicts empathy for members of advantaged versus disadvantaged groups.\\" Journal of personality and social psychology 114, no. 5 (2018): 665. Other findings and criticisms Research suggests that people high in SDO tend to support using violence in intergroup relations while those low in SDO oppose it, however it has also been argued that people low in SDO can also support (and those high in it oppose) violence in some circumstances, if the violence is seen as a form of counter dominance - for example, Lebanese people low in SDO approved more strongly of terrorism against the West than Lebanese people high in SDO, seemingly because it entailed a low status group (Lebanese) attacking a high status one (Westerners).Henry, Patrick J., Jim Sidanius, Shana Levin, and Felicia Pratto. \\"Social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, and support for intergroup violence between the Middle East and America.\\" Political Psychology 26, no. 4 (2005): 569-584. Low levels of SDO have been found to result in individuals possessing positive biases towards outgroup members, for example regarding outgroup members as less irrational than ingroup members, the reverse of what is usually found.Besta, Tomasz, G√ºl√ßin Akbas, Emma A. Renstr√∂m, Natasza Kosakowska-Berezecka, and Alexandra Vazquez. \\"Liking Low-Status? Contextual and Individual Differences in Attributional Biases of Low-Status Outgroup Members.\\" Journal of Social and Political Psychology 7, no. 1 (2019): 192-212. In the modern day US, research indicates that most people tend to score fairly low on the SDO scale, with an average score of 2.98 on a 7-point scale (with 7 being the highest in SDO and 1 the lowest), with a standard deviation of 1.19.Lucas, Brian J., and Nour S. Kteily. \\"(Anti-) egalitarianism differentially predicts empathy for members of advantaged versus disadvantaged groups.\\" Journal of personality and social psychology 114, no. 5 (2018): 665. This has also been found to apply cross-culturally, with the average SDO score being around 2.6, although there was some variation (Switzerland scoring somewhat lower and Japan scoring substantially higher).Kleppest√∏, Thomas Haarklau. \\"Social Dominance Orientation (SDO).\\" (2019). Because SDO scales tend to skew towards egalitarianism, some researchers have argued that this has caused a misinterpretation of correlations between SDO scores and other variables, arguing that low-SDO scorers, rather than high-SDO scorers, are possibly driving most of the correlations. Thus SDO research may actually be discovering the psychology of egalitarianism rather than the reverse.Crawford, J.T. and Jussim, L. eds., 2017. Politics of Social Psychology. Psychology Press.Bizumic, Boris, Amanda Kenny, Ravi Iyer, Juliet Tanuwira, and Elizabeth Huxley. \\"Are the ethnically tolerant free of discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance?.\\" European Journal of Social Psychology 47, no. 4 (2017): 457-471. SDO has been found to be related to color blindess as a racial ideology. For low SDO individuals, color blindness predicts more negative attitudes towards ethnic minorities but for high SDO individuals, it predicts more positive attitudes.Yogeeswaran, Kumar, Thomas Davies, and Chris G. Sibley. \\"Janus‚Äêfaced nature of colorblindness: Social dominance orientation moderates the relationship between colorblindness and outgroup attitudes.\\" European Journal of Social Psychology 47, no. 4 (2017): 509-516. SDO levels can also interact with other variables - when assessing blame for the 2011 England riots, high SDO individuals uniformly blamed ethnic diversity regardless of whether they agreed with official government discourse, whereas low SDO individuals did not blame ethnic diversity if they disagreed with official government discourse but did blame ethnic diversity if they did agree, almost to the same degree as high SDO individuals.Fasel, Nicole, Oriane Sarrasin, Eva GT Green, and Eric Mayor. \\"Who is to blame? Official discourse and ethnic diversity attitudes during the 2011 riots in England.\\" Political Psychology 37, no. 5 (2016): 659-675. Another study found that in a mock hiring experiment, participants high in SDO were more likely to favour a white applicant while those low in SDO were more likely to favour a black applicant.Reynolds, Tania, Luke Zhu, Karl Aquino, and Brendan Strejcek. \\"Dual pathways to bias: Evaluators‚Äô ideology and ressentiment independently predict racial discrimination in hiring contexts.\\" Journal of Applied Psychology (2020). SDO has also been found to relate to attitudes towards social class.Alvarez, Mauricio J. \\"Impact of Class-based Prejudice toward Defendants and Victims on Mock Jurors‚Äô Decision-Making.\\" PhD diss., 2018.Wang, P., Tan, C.H., Wu, W. and Luo, X.M., 2019. Social dominance orientation and stereotype influence perception of social distance between classes. Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal, 47(4), pp.1-8. A study report published by Nature in 2017 indicates there may be a correlation between FMRI scanned brain response to social ranks and the SDO scale. Subjects who tended to prefer hierarchical social structures and to promote socially dominant behaviors as measured by SDO exhibited stronger responses in the right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right aDLPFC) when facing superior players. The French National Agency for Research funded study involved 28 male subjects and used FMRI measurements to demonstrate that response in the right aDLPFC to social ranks was strongly correlated with participant SDO scores measuring response to social ranks. Correlation with conservative political views Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence that a high social dominance orientation is strongly correlated with conservative political views, and opposition to programs and policies that aim to promote equality (such as affirmative action, laws advocating equal rights for homosexuals, women in combat, etc.). There has been some debate within the psychology community on what the relation is between SDO and racism/sexism. One explanation suggests that opposition to programs that promote equality need not be based on racism or sexism but on a \\"principled conservatism\\", that is, a \\"concern for equality of opportunity, color-blindness, and genuine conservative values\\". Some principled-conservatism theorists have suggested that racism and conservatism are independent, and only very weakly correlated among the highly educated, who truly understand the concepts of conservative values and attitudes. In an effort to examine the relationship between education, SDO, and racism, Sidanius and his colleagues asked approximately 4,600 Euro-Americans to complete a survey in which they were asked about their political and social attitudes, and their social dominance orientation was assessed. \\"These findings contradict much of the case for the principled conservatism hypothesis, which maintains that political values that are largely devoid of racism, especially among highly educated people.\\" Contrary to what these theorists would predict, correlations among SDO, political conservatism, and racism were strongest among the most educated, and weakest among the least educated. Sidanius and his colleagues hypothesized this was because the most educated conservatives tend to be more invested in the hierarchical structure of society and in maintaining the inequality of the status quo in society in order to safeguard their status. Culture SDO is typically measured as an individual personality construct. However, cultural forms of SDO have been discovered on the macro level of society. Discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping can occur at various levels of institutions in society, such as transnational corporations, government agencies, schools and criminal justice systems. The basis of this theory of societal level SDO is rooted in evolutionary psychology, which states that humans have an evolved predisposition to express social dominance that is heightened under certain social conditions (such as group status) and is also mediated by factors such as individual personality and temperament. Democratic societies are lower in SDO measures The more that a society encourages citizens to cooperate with others and feel concern for the welfare of others, the lower the SDO in that culture. High levels of national income and empowerment of women are also associated with low national SDO, whereas more traditional societies with lower income, male domination and more closed institutional systems are associated with a higher SDO. Individuals who are socialized within these traditional societies are more likely to internalize gender hierarchies and are less likely to challenge them. Biology and sexual differences The biology of SDO is unknown. Plenty of evidence suggests that men tend to score higher on SDO than women, and this is true across different countries, cultures, age-groups, classes, religions and educational levels. Researchers argue for an 'invariance' in the difference between men and women's SDO; suggesting that even if all other factors were to be controlled for, the difference between men and women's SDO would still remain ‚Äì this however in some cases is disproved. From an evolutionary and biological perspective SDO facilitates men to be successful in their reproductive strategy through achieving social power and control over other males and becoming desired mating partners for the opposite sex. Males are observed to be more socially hierarchical, as indicated by speaking time, and yielding to interruptions. Males higher average SDO levels has been suggested as an explanation for gender differences in support for policies; males are more likely to support military force, defence spending and the death penalty and less likely to support social welfare or minimum wage legislation, while females are more likely to believe in the reverse. This is because males, due to being more likely to have higher SDO scores, are more likely to view inequalities as the natural result of competition and thus are more likely to have a negative view of policies designed to mitigate or dilute the effects of competition.Campbell, Anne. A mind of her own: The evolutionary psychology of women. OUP Oxford, 2013, p.109 Noting that males tend to have higher SDO scores than females, Sidanius and Pratto speculate that SDO may be influenced by hormones that differ between the sexes, namely androgens, primarily testosterone. Male levels of testosterone are much higher than those of females. Taking a socio-cultural perspective, it is argued that the gap between women and men in SDO is dependent upon societal norms prescribing different expectations for gender roles of men and women. Men are expected to be dominant and assertive, whereas women are supposed to be submissive and tender. Differences between male and female attributional cognitive complexity are suggested to contribute to the gender gap in SDO. Women have been found to be more attributionally complex compared to men; they use more contextual information and evaluate social information more precisely. It is proposed that lower social status prompts higher cognitive complexity in order to compensate for the lack of control in that social situation by processing it more attentively and evaluating it more in depth. The difference in cognitive complexity between high and low status individuals could contribute to the differences between male and female SDO. Some evidence suggests that both the dominance and anti-egalitarianism dimensions of SDO are determined by genetic, rather than environmental, factors.

Superstabilizing distributed algorithms combine the features of self- stabilizing algorithms and dynamic algorithms. A superstabilizing algorithm ‚Äì just like any other self-stabilizing algorithm ‚Äì can be started in an arbitrary state, and it will eventually converge to a legitimate state. Additionally, a superstabilizing algorithm will recover rapidly from a single change in the network topology (adding or removing one edge or node in the network). Any self-stabilizing algorithm recovers from a change in the network topology ‚Äì the system configuration after a topology change can be treated just like any other arbitrary starting configuration. However, in a self- stabilizing algorithm, the convergence after a single change in the network topology may be as slow as the convergence from an arbitrary starting state. In the study of superstabilizing algorithms, special attention is paid to the time it takes to recover from a single change in the network topology. Definitions The stabilization time of a superstabilizing algorithm is defined exactly as in the case of self-stabilizing algorithm: how long it takes to converge to a legitimate state from an arbitrary configuration. Depending on the computational model, time is measured, e.g., in synchronous communication rounds or in asynchronous cycles. The superstabilization time is the time to recover from a single topology change. It is assumed that the system is initially in a legitimate configuration. Then the network topology is changed; the superstabilization time is the maximum time it takes for the system to reach a legitimate configuration again. Similarly, the adjustment measure is the maximum number of nodes that have to change their state after such changes. The ‚Äúalmost-legitimate configurations‚Äù which occur after one topology change can be formally modelled by using passage predicates: a passage predicate is a predicate that holds after a single change in the network topology, and also during the convergence to a legitimate configuration.

He was later elected to federal parliament, where he served as a government minister under George Reid. McLean was born in Argyll, Scotland, and arrived in Australia as a child. His family settled in the Gippsland region of Victoria, and he eventually acquired a sheep station near Lake Wellington. McLean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1880 and was promoted to cabinet in 1890, serving under James Munro, William Shiels, and George Turner. He replaced Turner as premier in 1899, but was defeated at the following year's general election. McLean entered the new federal parliament in 1901, as a member of the Protectionist Party. He was a leader of its conservative wing, and in 1904 crossed the floor to become Minister for Trade and Customs in the Reid Government. He was the de facto deputy prime minister. The government was defeated in 1905, and he lost his seat at the 1906 election. Early life McLean was born in the highlands of Scotland and came to Australia as a child in 1842 with his family. He later said 'were practically frozen out of Scotland' by 'an exceptionally severe winter'. His father, Charles McLean, was a grazier near Tarraville, in the Gippsland region of Victoria. McLean was educated at the local state school, assisted his father on his stations, and for a short period was on the staff of the Gippsland Times. About 1870, he acquired the lease of 'The Lowlands', a sheep station, on the shores of Lake Wellington near Sale and in 1872, formed the firm of A. McLean and Company, Stock and Station Agents, at Maffra. He became a shire councillor at Maffra in 1873, and as president of the shire was active in forming the Municipal Association of Victoria. Victorian politics McLean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Gippsland North in May 1880. A conservative, he was President of the Board of Land and Works and Minister of Agriculture in the James Munro ministry from 1890 to 1891, and Chief Secretary from 1891 to 1892, retaining this position under William Shiels from 1892 to 1893. He became a minister without portfolio in the liberal government of George Turner in 1894, but resigned in April 1898. On 5 December 1899, he moved and carried a vote of no-confidence, becoming Premier and Chief Secretary, but his government lasted less than a year. At the 1900 election the conservatives were defeated and Turner reclaimed the premiership. Federal politics McLean was an opponent of Australian federation and was not a member of the conventions which shaped the Australian Constitution. However, reassured to some degree by Deakin's composite stand as an Australian Briton, McLean sent him to London in January 1900 as Victoria's representative in negotiations with the British government. In March 1901, however, he was elected a member of the first Australian House of Representatives for the seat of Gippsland, and sat as a supporter of the Protectionist Party of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin. McLean belonged to the conservative wing of the party and opposed Deakin's increasingly warm alliance with the Labour Party. In April 1904 Deakin resigned and the Labour leader, Chris Watson, formed a minority government. Watson resigned in August, and the Free Trade leader George Reid formed another minority government, supported by the conservative Protectionists. McLean came into the cabinet as Minister for Trade and Customs, and his position was so strong that the government is often referred to as the Reid-McLean ministry. This composite ministry was, however, not a success. It was constantly being assailed by the Labour Party and the radical Protectionist section of Deakin's followers, such as H. B. Higgins and Isaac Isaacs. It lasted for less than 11 months, and fell when Deakin withdrew his support. This episode caused great bitterness in the Protectionist ranks, and at the 1906 election McLean was opposed in Gippsland by a radical Protectionist, George Wise, who narrowly defeated McLean with Labour support. Personal life McLean, who had suffered for many years with a rheumatic affliction and did not feel capable of doing justice to his constituents, retired before the next election. He died at his home at Albert Park in 1911. Sir George Reid said of him that \\"no public man in Victoria was more widely or more affectionately esteemed\\" (My Reminiscences, p. 238). He was twice married, once in 1866 to Margaret Bridget Shinnock of Maffra (ca.1847 ‚Äì 7 August 1884), and subsequently, to Emily Macarthur (n√©e Linton), who survived him with five sons and two daughters by the first marriage. His eldest son, William Joseph McLean (d. 19 April 1938) was a noted pastoralist, and senior partner in the firm of A. McLean and Co., stock and station agents of Maffra, Sale and Bairnsdale, and the Melbourne firm of McLean, McKenzie and Co.

Set in the United Kingdom, it follows the Jack Kirby-esque story of Ali, a British Asian man who must confront ancient monsters inspired by Indian folklore, as well as more mundane crises in his family and personal life. Synopsis It is the story of Ali, a young British Asian man awaiting the arrival of his unseen arranged marriage. A baby in his family accidentally opens a path to the centre of the Earth, unleashing ancient monsters hell-bent on destroying the world. Only the Ultra-Hadeen, a team of ancient and somewhat naive superheroes, can stop them. Ali also must deal with several personal family crises, most of them influenced by the presence of the super-beings. Influences The story is a Jack Kirby-like (in particular his ancient astronaut series The Eternals) take on ancient Indian tales, for example the Vedas (a vimana as a flying plane, for example) and Mahabharata. It also has an Arabian Nights-style romance mixed with a large dash of psychedelia and general oddness. Morrison has said that the idea arose after 9-11 when his research into Islam led him on to the ancient epic tales of India and some of the more speculative theories of people like David Hatcher Childress.

It was the seal that was designed for Martin Luther at the behest of John Frederick of Saxony in 1530, while Luther was staying at the Coburg Fortress during the Diet of Augsburg. Lazarus Spengler, to whom Luther wrote his interpretation below, sent Luther a drawing of this seal. Luther saw it as a compendium or expression of his theology and faith, which he used to authorize his correspondence. Luther informed Philipp Melanchthon on September 15, 1530, that the Prince had personally visited him in the Coburg fortress and presented him with a signet ring, presumably displaying the seal.LW 49, 356-359. Components of the seal connected to Luther earlier than 1530 A single rose had been known as Luther's emblem since 1520 when Wolfgang St√∂ckel in Leipzig published one of Luther‚Äôs sermons with a woodcut of the reformer.

There is also a southern section between Mora and √ñstersund. The Inland Line () is a railway line between Kristinehamn and G√§llivare in Sweden. It runs through the central parts of northern Sweden, and was built between 1908 and 1937.  History  There were several reasons for constructing the railway. The original main line to the north of Sweden ran relatively near the east coast, but inland connections were poor to non- existent; the inland regions, rich in natural resources (mainly timber) needed opening up. However, there was a strategic aspect to be considered; should Sweden be invaded from the east (which at the time was a serious possibility) the belligerents would certainly try to cut the main line to the north as quickly as possible; thus a second reserve route further inland was deemed highly important. In 1907 the Riksdag decided that the first link between √ñstersund and Ulriksfors was to be built. The next stage Ulriksfors‚ÄìVolgsj√∂ (today Vilhelmina) was conceived in 1911; the year after that the Sveg-Brunflo stage was given the go ahead. The northernmost stage Vilhelmina‚ÄìG√§llivare was given the go-ahead in 1917. Finally, by purchasing the private railway lines between Sveg and Kristinehamn the entire 1288 km stretch stood clear. It was to take many years for the navvies to build this line. Originally it was to be inaugurated in 1924, but due to the effects of WW1, the post-war recession and labour shortages it was not finished until 1937, opened on 6 August that year. The line was thereafter operated by SJ, but never proved profitable, suffering a gradually decreasing service until 1992, when it was mothballed entirely. By this time the far southern section from Mora to Filipstad had already been closed. The remaining track was subsequently sold off to the municipalities along the route. Today Inlandsbanan AB operates a passenger service for about 3 months each summer, primarily for tourists. For 2013 the service consists of one train pair on the √ñstersund‚ÄìG√§llivare section, a journey of around 14 hours; likewise a single train pair makes the round trip √ñstersund‚ÄìMora‚Äì√ñstersund, taking about 6 hours each way. The line has also been re-opened to freight and sees a considerable amount of traffic, mainly logging traffic. Also for 2013 the line between Kristinehamn and Mora has been refurbished and is once again open throughout, served by one train pair per day for the peak period (for exact times check Inlandbanan's web site); otherwise a coach service is provided along the route. The southernmost , Kristinehamn‚ÄìNykroppa, also has a sparse all-seasons passenger service operated by V√§rmlandstrafik as part of a line from Kristinehamn to Ludvika.

The park is located at the western end of Mott Avenue in Bayswater near Far Rockaway and is built on land that once housed the mansion and estate of banker Louis A. Heinsheimer. History The land that is now occupied by Bayswater Point State Park was once home to \\"Breezy Point\\", an expansive mansion built in 1907 by New York City banker Louis A. Heinsheimer. In 1925, the mansion was converted into a home for disabled children, and it was later used as a home for children with intellectual disabilities before being put on the market in the late 1980s. A parcel that was to become Bayswater Point State Park was purchased by the Trust for Public Land in 1986. The mansion, which by that point had been damaged by fire, was demolished in 1987 prior to the land being given to New York State in 1988; only the conservatory was left standing. New York State designated the land as a state park in 1991, and gave New York City Audubon administrative duties over the park. Between 1994 and 1996, the Audubon Society conducted a research and restoration project at Bayswater Point, seeking to engage the public with the land's conservation. In early May 2010, the park was briefly closed to the public as a result of budget cuts, along with 57 additional state parks and historic sites. However, by month's end an agreement had been reached to re-open many of the parks, including Bayswater Point. In 2015, an $80,000 improvement project to stabilize Sunset Lodge at the park was announced. Usage Bayswater Point State Park was established in order to preserve important habitat for migratory birds in Jamaica Bay. The park also protects habitat for butterflies such as the Delaware skipper, and its beach is used by horseshoe crabs during their annual mating season. As such, the park is largely undeveloped, and primarily offers space for passive recreation such as hiking, birdwatching, and fishing.

It was the seat of the former Verbandsgemeinde Hillesheim. The old city walls  Geography  = Location = The town lies almost in the middle, halfway between Cologne and Trier (70 km from the former and 60 km from the latter, as the crow flies), and only 30 km from the Belgian border. Hillesheim lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. = Constituent communities = Hillesheim's outlying Stadtteile are Niederbettingen and Bolsdorf.  History  Hillesheim is an old market town in the heart of the Eifel dating back more than a thousand years. On 17 March 1974, the until then self-administering municipalities of Niederbettingen and Bolsdorf were amalgamated with Hillesheim. On 24 October 1993, Hillesheim was granted town rights.  Politics  = Town council = The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Stadtrat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  CDU  FWG 1  FWG 2  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  2  6  6  6  20 seats } = Coat of arms = The German blazon reads: Schild durch eine geschweifte Spitze dreigeteilt; vorn in Silber ein rotes Kreuz, hinten in Gold eine schwarze Wolfsangel, unten in Blau √ºber goldenem Halbmond eine silberne Madonna mit Kind, je mit goldenem Nimbus. The town's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Tierced in mantle dexter argent a cross gules, sinister Or a cramp sable and in base azure standing on a crescent of the third the Madonna and Child of the first, both with nimbus of the third, ensigning the shield a wall masoned, embattled of five and embowed with an arched gateway of the first. Hillesheim was from 1352 to 1794 the northernmost outpost of the Archbishopric of Trier. This was made clear to all in that time by the town walls, which were particularly imposing for the Eifel. This small town grew with the building of the town walls in the 13th century into a regionally influential town. Marking this is the so-called Mauerkrone ‚Äì ‚Äúwall crown‚Äù ‚Äì on top of (‚Äúensigning‚Äù) the escutcheon (although curiously, the German blazon does not mention this part of the arms). The cross on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is the Electoral-Trier armorial bearing, referring to that state's rule over the town in feudal times. The ‚Äúcramp‚Äù, as it is called in English heraldry,‚ÄúCramp‚Äù, according to James Parker. or Wolfsangel as it is known in German heraldry, seen on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, is a charge seen in several coats of arms borne by a particular Hillesheim family, some of whom functioned as Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù). The Madonna in the base was already to be found in the old town seal from 1306, reappearing on Sch√∂ffen seals in the 14th and 15th centuries. These Madonna seals were in use until the late 18th century, and thus the Madonna was always closely bound to the townsfolk.Description and explanation of Hillesheim‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing  The town is one of the few European Model Towns and its renovation works are therefore subsidized by the town's urban development promotion programme. There is a mediaeval town centre partly surrounded by a town wall and with a church worth seeing for its Baroque organ from 1772, built by the famous Stumm family, annually attracting talented international organists.

For all local public transport, three tariff systems apply: the Verkehrsverbund Region Trier (VRT), the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg, and for journeys crossing tariff zones, the NRW-Tarif.  Road  The resident population is hoping that the gap in the A 1 between Daun-Rengen and Blankenheim in North Rhine-Westphalia will be filled, as all traffic currently rolls through Hillesheim, thereby causing very busy road conditions, especially on Fridays. On the other hand, this does conflict with local retailers‚Äô interests, for they have been profiting from spontaneous purchases made by those passing through town for a long time. = Established businesses = Hillesheim is headquarters to the KBV-Verlag (publishing house). = Tourism = The town of Hillesheim is a tourist destination, above all for visitors from North Rhine-Westphalia and the Netherlands. Besides the mediaeval town centre with its church, foremost among sights worth seeing is the ‚ÄúBolsdorfer T√§lchen‚Äù recreational area, where a lake, hiking loops, leisure activities and pubs on the town's outskirts invite visitors. The network of paths in the ‚ÄúBolsdorfer T√§lchen‚Äù is also a direct link to the Kylltal Cycle Path, which leads more than 115 km from the Kronenburg reservoir to the Kyll's mouth on the Moselle in Trier-Ehrang. Hillesheim is a ‚Äústation‚Äù on the Eifel-Krimi-Wanderweg (‚ÄúEifel Crime Fiction Hiking Trail‚Äù), which is based on books by crime fiction authors Jacques Berndorf and Ralf Kramp. The Geopfad Hillesheim, at 30 stations in the town's vicinity, casts light on the Eifel's geology and on the evidence of vulcanism in the Vulkaneifel. = Public institutions =  Administration  In Hillesheim is the administrative seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Hillesheim, which by population is the district's second smallest Verbandsgemeinde, after the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg.

Playing career Caig made his name playing for Carlisle United from 1990 to 1998, some highlights of this time being the penalty saves in the Football League Trophy at Wembley against Colchester United in 1997 and winning the 3rd division championship in 94/95 setting a then clean sheet record. However, in 1998 he was controversially allowed to leave by club owner Michael Knighton before the end-season transfer deadline. He had made 244 league and 40 cup appearances for the club. Caig's departure left Carlisle United without a permanent goalkeeper, circumstances which led to a famous goal by on-loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass saving the club from relegation. He then joined Blackpool on 25 March 1999 for a reported small fee of ¬£40,000; he was able to establish himself as a regular in the first team, and won a place in the Carling Opta Division Two \\"Team of the Week\\" in October 1999. He made 49 league appearances and 12 cup appearances in his two-year stint at Bloomfield Road, during which time he was sent on loan to Charlton Athletic, before signing for them permanently in 2001. However, he was to make just one Premier League appearance for them against Derby County before moving to Scotland later that same year to join Scottish Premier League (SPL) club Hibernian. Although not a regular starter and made 16 appearances in 18 months at the club. In January 2003 Caig moved back to England and joined Premier League club Newcastle United. However, he spent three years at St James' Park without making a first team appearance, being backup to longtime goalkeepers Shay Given and Steve Harper. He spent a short loan spell at Barnsley and in 2006 he signed for USL First Division club, Vancouver Whitecaps in Canada on 13 April 2006.Caig returning to England. He made his first appearance for them on 14 May 2006. With the Whitecaps he won the 2006 USL First Division Championship, when they beat Rochester Raging Rhinos 2‚Äì0 in the Play-offs Final. He also kept eleven clean sheets, and in doing so broke Mike Franks' record of ten clean sheets in 2003. On 20 June 2007, the Whitecaps announced that Caig would be returning to England for personal reasons despite having signed with the Whitecaps through the end of the season. He had played a total of 39 games for the Whitecaps. He signed on amateur terms with SPL club Gretna in October 2007 after a long running transfer saga. The SPL had initially objected to Gretna signing Caig because he had still been under contract with Vancouver at the closure of the summer 2007 transfer window. Caig played nine times for Gretna in the league and cup in a short spell and also served as a goalkeeping coach. He then moved to Houston Dynamo in January 2008, where he was to serve as cover to Pat Onstad. He made his Dynamo debut on 6 April 2008 as a substitute after Onstad was injured. Due to Onstad's injury, Caig played again on 9 April in the 2008 CONCACAF Champions' Cup semi-final 2nd leg against Costa Rican club Deportivo Saprissa, Caig then played other MLS and Concacaf Champions league games before returning to the UK at the end of that MLS season. On returning to England he signed for Chesterfield on a short-term deal. After leaving Chesterfield, Caig signed a deal to join Workington A.F.C. in the Conference North to team up with former Carlisle teammate Darren Edmondson, now the manager of Workington. Coaching Caig started coaching Carlisle United's goalkeepers while still playing for Workington where he won the Non league Goalkeeper of the year award for 2009/10 and also the Reds player of the year award and National supporters award in helping Workington to a 4th- place finish. Carlisle then entered negotiations with Workington to allow Caig to combine his coaching duties with serving as an understudy to current first choice goalkeeper Adam Collin. During the 2014‚Äì15 season he was, alongside Paul Thirlwell, made Caretaker Manager for 4 games following the dismissal of Graham Kavanagh as manager. After an injury to first choice goalkeeper Mark Gillespie in September 2014, Caig was re-registered as a player to provide cover for backup goalkeeper Dan Hanford. He was allocated the number 29 shirt. On 2 June 2015 Caig signed for Hartlepool United as a goalkeeping coach, the same role he held at Carlisle United. Caig left Hartlepool United in January 2017 due to a change of management and took a role at Newcastle United Academy coaching the 12-16 Keepers, then in June 2017 Caig left Newcastle and took the Bury F.C Head GK Coach job to assist Lee Clark and Alan Thompson. Caig's contract was terminated once Bury were expelled from the EFL, he then took up his current position as a goalkeeping coach of Scottish Premiership club, Livingston.

It was a particularly bloody battle, described by the English as a second Agincourt. The battle started with a short archery duel between English longbowmen and Scottish archers, after which a force of 2,000 Milanese heavy cavalry on the French side mounted a cavalry charge that brushed aside the ineffective English arrowstorm and wooden archer's stakes, penetrated the formation of English men-at-arms and dispersed one wing of their longbowmen. The Milanese went on to rout the English baggage train and its security force, looting the train and quitting the field. Fighting on foot, the well-armoured Anglo-Norman and Franco-Scottish men-at-arms clashed in the open in a ferocious hand-to-hand melee that went on for about 45 minutes. The English longbowmen reformed and joined the struggle. The French men-at-arms broke in the end and were slaughtered, with the now-alone Scots in particular receiving no quarter from the English. The Milanese heavy cavalry returned to the field at the battle's conclusion but fled upon discovering their army's fate. Altogether some 6,000 French and allied troops were killed and 200 taken prisoner. The Burgundian chronicler Jean de Wavrin estimated 1,600 English killed, although the English commander, the Duke of Bedford claimed to have lost only two men-at-arms and \\"a very few archers\\". The Scots army, led by the earls of Douglas and Buchan (both of whom were killed), was almost completely destroyed. Many French noblemen were taken prisoner, among them the Duke of Alen√ßon and Marshal de La Fayette. After Verneuil, the English were able to consolidate their position in Normandy. The Army of Scotland as a distinct unit ceased to play a significant part in the Hundred Years' War, although many Scots continued to serve in France. Background In 1424, France had not recovered from the 1415 disaster at Agincourt, and the northern provinces were in the hands of the English following King Henry V's conquest of Normandy. The Dauphin (heir to the French throne) Charles had been disinherited due to the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, and, upon the death of his father Charles VI in October 1422, his status as King of France was recognised only in the regions still not occupied by the English, namely the south of the country (less the province of Guyenne in the southwest). The civil war between the pro-Dauphin Armagnacs and the pro-English Burgundians showed no sign of ending. The death of Henry V in August, two months before that of Charles VI, brought no relief, as the continuing English war effort was managed by John, Duke of Bedford, acting for the nine-month-old Henry VI. The Dauphin desperately needed soldiers, and looked to Scotland, France's old ally against England, to provide essential military aid. =Army of Scotland= The first large contingent of Scots troops came to France in the autumn of 1419, some 6,000 men under the command of John Stewart, Earl of Buchan. These men, supplemented from time-to-time with fresh volunteers, soon became an integral part of the French war effort, and by the summer of 1420 the 'Army of Scotland' was a distinct force in the French royal service. They proved their worth the following year, playing a large part in the victory at the Battle of Baug√©, the first serious setback experienced by the English. The mood of optimism this engendered collapsed in 1423, when many of Buchan's men fell at the Battle of Cravant. At the beginning of 1424, Buchan brought with him a further 6,500 men. He was accompanied by Archibald, Earl of Douglas, one of the most powerful noblemen of Scotland. On 24 April, the army, comprising 2,500 men at arms and 4,000 archers, entered Bourges, the Dauphin's headquarters, helping to raise Charles' spirits. A body of 2,000 heavy cavalry from the Duchy of Milan in Italy, led by the Frenchman le Borgne-Caqueran, clad in complete suits of tempered steel plate armour, was hired from Filippo Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan, after a treaty of alliance on 17 February. A smaller Milanese heavy cavalry force had already been employed to decisive effect against the Burgundians at La Buissi√®re in September 1423. The victory of the French under the Count of Aumale against the English at the Battle of La Brossini√®re on 26 September and another victory over the Burgundians at La Buissi√®re the same month improved the Dauphin's strategic situation. The outflanking and destruction of a body of English longbowmen at La Brossini√®re convinced the French that it would be possible to destroy a large English army in a decisive battle. A plan was hatched: the main English army would be sought out and crushed, after which Charles VII would be crowned as king in Reims. Prelude In August, the new Franco-Scottish army made ready to march into action to relieve the fortress of Ivry (about 50 km northeast of Verneuil), which had been under siege by the Duke of Bedford. Douglas (newly created Duke of Touraine) and Buchan left Tours on 4 August to link with the French commanders, the Duke of Alen√ßon, the Count of Aumale, and the Viscount of Narbonne. But before the army could arrive, Ivry surrendered to the English. Uncertain what to do, the allied commanders held a council of war. The Scots and some of the younger French officers were eager for battle, but Narbonne and the senior nobility had not forgotten Agincourt, and were reluctant to take the risk. As a compromise it was agreed to attack the English strongholds on the Norman border, beginning with Verneuil in the west. The town was taken by a simple trick: a group of Scots, leading some of their fellow countrymen as prisoners, pretended to be English, and claimed that Bedford had defeated the allies in battle, whereupon the gates were opened. On 15 August, Bedford received news that Verneuil was in French hands and made his way there as quickly as he could. As he neared the town two days later, the Scots persuaded their French comrades to make a stand. Douglas is said to have received a message from Bedford that he had come to drink with him and prayed for an early meeting. He replied that having failed to find the duke in England he had come to seek him in France. Battle =Dispositions= The allied Franco-Scottish army deployed a mile north of Verneuil on an open plain astride the road leading out of the forest of Piseux. The flat fields had been chosen to give the greatest advantage to the Milanese cavalry, whereby they could be employed to their full potential against the enemy archers. The mounted Milanese men-at-arms under Caqueran drew up in front of the dismounted Franco-Scottish men-at-arms, who were formed into one battle. Narbonne's Spanish mercenary men-at-arms and most of the French were situated on the left of the road, while Douglas and Buchan were on the right. Aumale was given overall command, but this heterogeneous army defied all attempts at co- ordinated direction. On emerging from the forest, Bedford likewise put his men in a single battle, to match the disposition of the enemy, with the usual distribution of men-at-arms in the centre and archers on the wings and in front, with sharpened stakes in front of them. Bedford put a lightly armoured force of 500‚Äì2,000 men, some mounted, in charge of guarding the baggage train and the horses and preserving his rear security. Some 8,500 horses were tethered together to link up the main army to the baggage wagons as a precaution against encirclement. Both sides wanted the other to take the initiative in beginning the battle, and so, from dawn to about 4:00 pm, the two armies stood facing each other under the blazing sun. Bedford is also said to have sent a herald to Douglas once both armies had been deployed to ask what terms for battle he required, to which Douglas grimly replied that the Scots would neither give nor receive any quarter. =Milanese attack= At about 4pm, Bedford ordered his men to advance. The English soldiers shouted \\"St. George! Bedford!\\" as they slowly began to cross the field. A short archery duel between English and Scottish archers took place, with inconclusive results. At the same time, as if by some pre-arranged signal, the 2,000 Milanese mounted men-at-arms charged through the English front line. The Milanese brushed aside the English wooden stakes that could not be secured in ground baked hard by the summer sun. The English arrow storm proved ineffective against the Italian mercenaries' superior armor. The shock effect of the Milanese charge terrified the English, with men-at-arms and archers knocked over, gaps torn in the English ranks as they tried to avoid the onrushing horsemen and others throwing themselves to the ground and being ridden over by the cavalry. The Milanese rode through the entire English formation, dispersing the longbowmen on the English right. Many of the English panicked in face of the Milanese advance and a Captain Young was afterwards found guilty of cowardice for retreating with the 500 men under his command without orders, considering the battle as lost. Young was hanged, drawn and quartered as punishment for his retreat. English mounted troops fled to Conches, where they proclaimed the battle lost to the town's small garrison. At Bernay, more Englishmen announced Bedford's defeat. At Pont-Audemer, news of an English disaster provoked an uprising, with retreating English troops divested of their armour and horses. A series of smaller uprisings in the countryside also took place. The Milanese attacked the English baggage train, triggering an instant rout. The rearguard of 500‚Äì2,000 English men ran away, some fleeing on horseback and the Milanese gave chase. The Milanese returned to the field later, expecting the French to have won the battle, but were informed otherwise. =Men-at-arms clash= The Battle of Verneuil, 1484 illustration in the Vigiles du roi Charles VII After the devastating cavalry charge, Bedford rallied his soldiers, the English men-at-arms showing great discipline and reforming their ranks. Sensing a victory, the French men-at- arms led a confused charge, with Narbonne's men reaching the English before the rest of their comrades. The French disorder was in part a result of the desire to close in fast to avoid the English arrowstorm. As the French advanced under Aumale, they shouted \\"Montjoie! Saint Denis!\\". Bedford's men- at-arms advanced in good order towards their French opponents, pausing often and giving a shout each time. The men-at-arms under Thomas Montagu, Earl of Salisbury were hard pressed by the Scots. A small force of French heavy cavalry on the right attempted to outflank the English line but were repelled by an arrowstorm from the redeployed English left wing of 2,000 longbowmen, who used the lines of tethered horses for cover. The head-on clash between the superbly armoured English and French men-at-arms on the field of Verneuil, both of whom had marched on foot into battle, resulted, in the words of the British medievalist Desmond Seward, in \\"a hand-to-hand combat whose ferocity astounded even contemporaries\\". One veteran of Verneuil, Wavrin, recalled how \\"the blood of the dead spread on the field and that of the wounded ran in great streams all over the earth\\". For about three-quarters of an hour, Frenchmen and Englishmen stabbed, hacked and cut each other down on the field of Verneuil without either side gaining any advantage in what is often considered to be one of the most fiercely fought battles of the entire war. Bedford himself fought in the battle, wielding a fearsome two-handed pole-axe, leading one veteran to recall: \\"He reached no one whom he did not fell\\". Seward noted that Bedford's battle-axe \\"smashed open an expensive armour like a modern tin can, the body underneath being crushed and mangled before even the blade sank in\\". The English longbowmen on the right, dispersed by the Milanese charge, had by now reformed and they, along with longbowmen on the left who had repelled the French cavalry, joined the main struggle with a great shout that boosted the morale of the English men-at-arms. After some time, the French battle line gave ground before breaking and was chased back to Verneuil, where many, including Aumale, were drowned in the moat. The ditches outside of town were the scene of a merciless killing of the routed French men-at-arms. Narbonne, Ventadour, Tonnerre were all dead. Having disposed of the French, Bedford called a halt to the pursuit and returned to the battlefield, where Salisbury was engaged with the Scots, now standing alone. The battle of Verneuil reached its closing stages when Bedford wheeled from the south to take the Scots on the right flank. Now almost surrounded, the Scots made a ferocious last stand. The English shouted \\"A Clarence! A Clarence!\\" invoking Thomas, Duke of Clarence, Bedford's brother, killed at the Battle of Baug√© in 1421. The long-standing enmity between Scotland and England meant no quarter was given with those Scots attempting to surrender being cut down and almost the entire Scots force falling on the battlefield. The Scots stood their ground and died where they fought. Most of the Milanese cavalry returned to the battle at this point to discover their comrades slaughtered, and were put to flight in turn after losing 16‚Äì20 men killed. Aftermath Dauphin Charles was forced to postpone his plans of coronation at Reims. In the aftermath of Verneuil, the road appeared to lie open to take Bourges and thus bring all of France under English rule. Bedford, much inspired by the example of his late brother, Henry V, preferred to concentrate on finishing off the job of subjecting Maine and Anjou rather than run the risk of leading an advance into the south of France with these two provinces only partially conquered. Bedford preferred to methodically conquer one province at a time rather than risk all on a bold drive to conquer the south of France in one campaign, which might finally bring all of France under English rule, but which equally might end in disaster. The consequences of the victory at Verneuil were: The English captured all border posts of Lancastrian Normandy and La Hire withdrew to the east. The only exception was Mont Saint-Michel, where the monks resisted. A plan to take Rouen by mining was foiled likely due to Bedford's victory. =Casualties= John Stewart, Earl of Buchan, killed at Verneuil Verneuil was one of the bloodiest battles of the Hundred Years' War, described by the English as a second Agincourt. Likewise, Verneuil was a huge blow to French morale as for the second time in a decade the pride of French knighthood had met the English in open battle and had been decisively defeated. The only consolation for the French was this time the shame of defeat was shared with the Scots and Milanese. Altogether some 6,000‚Äì8,000 men on the French-allied side were slain. In a letter to Thomas Rempston written two days after the battle, Bedford stated that 7,262 allied troops were killed. Bedford put his losses at two men-at-arms, and \\"a very few archers\\". The Burgundian chronicler Jean de Wavrin, an eyewitness to the battle, estimated 6,000 killed on the French side, 200 captured and 1,600 Anglo-Norman deaths. Archibald, Earl of Douglas fought on the losing side for the last time, joined in death by the Earl of Buchan. Sir Alexander Buchanan, the man who had killed Clarence at Baug√© three years earlier, also died. The Army of Scotland was severely mauled; but it was not yet ready to march out of history. It did have the effect though, of greatly reducing any reinforcements from Scotland for future campaigns against the English in France. This was not entirely unwelcome to the French as one French chronicler, Basin, wrote that the catastrophe at Verneuil was at least counterbalanced by seeing the end of the Scots \\"whose insolence was intolerable\\". Among the prisoners were the Duke of Alen√ßon, Pierre, the bastard of Alen√ßon, and Marshal Gilbert Motier de La Fayette. Greatly saddened by the catastrophe at Verneuil, Charles VII continued to honour the survivors, one of whom, John Carmichael of Douglasdale (Jean VI de Saint-Michel), the chaplain of the dead Douglas, was created Bishop of Orl√©ans (1426‚Äì1438). Bedford returned in triumph to Paris, where \\"he was received as if he had been God ... in short, more honour was never done at a Roman triumph than was done that day to him and his wife\\". Literature and legacy The French contemporary chronicles made long details of the reactions of the inhabitants of Paris under Burgundian rule. The Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris and Enguerrand de Monstrelet's chronicles are major sources for this battle. The Chronique de Charles VII, roi de France, by the king's historian Jean Chartier (‚Äì1464), published by Vallet de Viriville in 1858, corroborated the story of a complete English victory. The French writers bemoaned the loss of life to Charles VII's cause. Richard Ager Newhall's study of warfare in 1924 remains a reliable authority on the battle tactics and events. The Victorian Rev. Stevenson translated a French study into the noble families which suffered so much in the Hundred Years' War, and is often quoted. And similarly, Sim√©on Luce (1833‚Äì1892), a 19th-century French medievalist historian, was transcribing from what remained of original documents in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.

Praetorian prefectures originated in the reign of Constantine I (r. 306-337), reaching their more or less final form in the last third of the 4th century and surviving until the 7th century, when the reforms of Heraclius diminished the prefecture's power, and the Muslim conquests forced the East Roman Empire to adopt the new theme system. Elements of the prefecture's administrative apparatus however are documented to have survived in the Byzantine Empire until the first half of the 9th century.  History  Map of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchy, showing the dioceses and the four Tetrarchs' zones of control. The office of the praetorian prefect had a long history dating back to the origins of the Roman Empire: initially, its two holders were the commanders of the Praetorian Guard, but gradually, they became the emperor's chief aides, and amassed considerable administrative and judicial responsibilities. The exact process of transformation to the chief civilian administrator of a specific territorial circumscription is still unclear.Kelly (2006), p. 185 A common misconception, based on Zosimus, is that Constantine I established the praetorian prefectures as definite territorial administrations as early as 318, or in 324, after his victory over Licinius.Morrison (2007), p. 190 During the Tetrarchy, when the number of holders of the imperial office multiplied (two senior emperors, the Augusti, and two junior colleagues, the Caesares), there is evidence for the existence of only two prefects at each time, presumably assigned to each of the Augusti. At that stage, the prefect's power was still immense. In the words of A.H.M. Jones, he was \\"a kind of grand vizier, the emperor's second in command, wielding a wide authority in almost every sphere of government, military and judicial, financial and general administration. He was the emperor‚Äôs chief of staff, adjutant-general, and quartermaster-general...\\".Jones (1964), p. 371 Following Diocletian's abdication in 305, civil war erupted among the various co-emperors, during which time each of the contenders appointed his own prefect, a pattern carried on during the period where the Empire was shared between Licinius and Constantine I.Kelly (2006), p. 186 In 317 a third prefect was added in Gaul for Constantine's son Crispus. After his execution in 326 this prefect was retained. From 317 there were never less than three, and for years 347-61, 74-79 and 88-91, four, with the addition of prefecture for Illyricum, although in the last two years it comprised only the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia which would be the permanent territory from then on after restoration in 395. Following Constantine's victory over Licinius and the unification of the Empire under his rule, the office was transformed. The prefect's military duties were removed by the creation of the purely military offices of the magister peditum and magister equitum (\\"Master of the Foot/Horse\\"), and the establishment of the magister officiorum as the powerful head of the palatine bureaucracy and the civil service at large provided a counterbalance to the prefect's power.Kelly (2006), pp. 187‚Äì188Kazhdan (1991), p. 1267 These reforms were the result of both the lack of officials suitable for the prefect's wide-ranging tasks,Jones (1964), p. 101 and of the desire to reduce the potential challenge to the emperor's authority posed by the over- mighty prefect.Kelly (2006), p. 187 The office of the prefect was consequently converted into a purely civilian administrative one, albeit retaining the highest position in the imperial hierarchy, immediately below the emperor himself.Morrison (2007), pp. 177‚Äì179 Another important departure from Tetrarchic practice was the increase in the number of holders: no less than five prefects are attested for ca. 332. This development is likely related to Constantine's giving his four sons specific territories to administer, envisioning a partition of imperial authority among them following his death. In this, the origins of the later territorial prefectures may be detected.Kelly (2006), pp. 186‚Äì187 The four prefectures of the Roman Empire, as they appear in the Notitia Dignitatum, ca. 400 AD. After Constantine's death in 337, his three surviving sons partitioned the Empire between them. As each new Augustus had his own praetorian prefect, this division created the first of what would gradually become the permanent praetorian prefectures: the western prefecture of Gaul (dioceses of Gaul,Viennensis, Hispania and Britain), the central prefecture of Italy, Illyricum and Africa (dioceses of Italy, Africa, Pannonia, Dacia and Macedonia) and the prefecture of the East (dioceses of Thrace, Asia, Pontus, Oriens). Egypt was part of the diocese of Oriens until 370 or 381. With the creation of the separate prefecture of Illyricum (dioceses of Pannonia, Dacia and Macedonia) in 347 until 361, and despite the occasional abolition of the latter, the picture that appears in the early 5th-century Notitia dignitatum (\\"list of dignities\\") was complete. The only major change was the removal of the diocese of Pannonia (renamed to \\"Diocese of Illyricum\\") from the prefecture of Illyricum and its incorporation into the prefecture of Italy in 379. The diocese of Italy was in practice divided into two: of Italy in the north, and Suburbicarian (\\"under the City\\") Italy in the south including Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. There were no vicars appointed to the dioceses of Gaul and Dacia, because the praetorian prefects of Gaul and Illyricum were resident. When the prefect of Italy was in Milan, a vicar for Illyricum was appointed to reside in Sirmium; when the prefect resided in Sirmium, the post was lapsed, and a vicar was appointed to reside in Milan in place of the prefect. In the course of the 5th century, the Western Empire was overrun by the invasions of Germanic tribes. However, the prefecture of Italy was retained by the new Ostrogothic Kingdom, which was still de jure part of the Empire, and Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great even re-established the prefecture of Gaul in the small portion of Gaul he conquered in the 510s. After the reconquest of Northern Africa by the Eastern Empire during the Vandalic War of 533‚Äì534, the new provinces were grouped by emperor Justinian I into a new praetorian prefecture of Africa, which would later be transformed into the Exarchate of Africa. The praetorian prefecture of Italy was also re-established after the end of the Gothic War, before it too evolved into an exarchate. In the East, the prefectures would continue to function until the mid-7th century, when the loss of most eastern provinces to the Muslim conquest and of the Balkans to Slavic tribes led to the creation of the Theme system. In the meantime, however, reforms under Heraclius had stripped the prefect from a number of his subordinate financial bureaux, which were set up as independent departments under logothetes.Haldon (1997), pp. 18‚Äì190 The last time the prefect of the East is directly attested comes from a law of 629.Haldon (1997), p. 195 According to some scholars however, traces of the system survived into the early 9th century: Ernst Stein demonstrated that some aspects of the Illyrian prefecture survived in the administration of Thessalonica,Kazhdan (1991), pp. 987, 1710 while John Haldon, based on sigillographic evidence and references in the Byzantine Taktika, has documented the survival of the earlier civilian provincial administration within the theme system, with the prefect in Constantinople possibly in a supervisory capability, until the 840s.Haldon (1997), pp. 195‚Äì207  Authority and powers of the prefect  The insignia of the praetorian prefect of Illyricum, as depicted in the Notitia Dignitatum: the ivory inkwell and pen case (theca), the codicil of appointment to the office on a blue cloth-covered table, and the state carriage.Kelly (2004), p. 41 Originally, the praetorian prefects were drawn from the equestrian class. Constantine's reforms entailed the reservation of this office for members of the senatorial class, and its prestige and authority were raised to the highest level, so that contemporary writers refer to it as the \\"supreme office\\".Morrison (2007), p. 177 In the divided Empire, the two senior prefects were those of the East and of Italy, residing in the courts of the two emperors and acting effectively as their first ministers, while the prefects of Illyricum and Gaul held a more junior position.Bury, p. 27 The prefects held wide-ranging control over most aspects of the administrative machinery of their provinces, and only the magister officiorum rivalled them in power. The prefects fulfilled the roles of supreme administrative and juridical official, already present from the time of Septimius Severus, and that of chief financial official, responsible for the state budget. In their capacity as judges, they had the right to pass judgment instead of the emperor (vice sacra), and, unlike lower governors, their decision could not be appealed. Their departments were divided in two major categories: the schola excerptorum, which supervised administrative and judicial affairs, and the scriniarii, overseeing the financial sector.Kazhdan (1991), 1710 References Sources * Notitia dignitatum   Category:Roman Empire in Late Antiquity ","title":"Praetorian prefecture"},{"id":"2504343","text":"Gumilev or Gumilyov is the surname of the following persons: *Nikolay Gumilyov (1886-1921), Russian poet of the Silver Age *Lev Gumilyov (1912-1992), Soviet/Russian historian, son of Nikolay Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova ","title":"Gumilev"},{"id":"2504347","text":"Flex Mentallo is a comic book character created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Richard Case in 1990, during their run on Doom Patrol. Flex is in part a parody of Charles Atlas' long-running \\"The Insult that made a Man out of Mac\\" advertisements seen in American comics from the past. In 1996, Flex Mentallo appeared in a self-titled, four-issue miniseries written by Morrison and illustrated by Frank Quitely. The miniseries forms part of what Morrison calls a thematic hypersigil trilogy along with The Invisibles and The Filth. Mentallo appears in his first live-action adaptation on the Doom Patrol television series for DC Universe and HBO Max, played by Devan Chandler Long. Publication history Flex Mentallo first appeared in 1991 in issue #35 of Grant Morrison's run on Doom Patrol as a member of the audience for Danny the Street's Perpetual Cabaret. Later in the storyline, Flex reveals that he is actually \\"The Man of Muscle Mystery\\", and tidies his appearance. In issue #42, Flex is revealed to be not an entirely original creation, but rather a parody of the post-workout protagonist of Charles Atlas' long-running \\"The Insult that made a Man out of Mac\\" advertisements seen in American comics from the past. Also parodied was My Greatest Adventure, the title in which the Doom Patrol originally appeared. Part of a long string of fictional characters \\"come to life\\" in Morrison's writing, Flex was apparently created by a psychic child with a green pen. The characters created in this child's youthful scrawlings, titled \\"My Greenest Adventure\\", apparently came to life. Amongst Flex's \\"Greenest Adventure\\" siblings were the villainous Waxworker and the heroic Fact. In 1996, Flex Mentallo received his own four-issue mini-series written by Morrison and illustrated by Frank Quitely. Although ignored by the Charles Atlas company at the time, it was later brought to the company's attention by a fan of the comics. Charles Atlas company president Jeffrey C. Hogue was unhappy with its likeness being used this way, and filed a trademark infringement suit against DC Comics. DC submitted a motion for summary dismissal, which was granted on the basis of fair use using the parody defense. DC has reprinted Flex's initial appearances, including the Charles Atlas parody, in the third and fourth collections of the Morrison Doom Patrol stories, \\"'Down Paradise Way\\" and \\"Musclebound\\". In 2012, DC reprinted the miniseries in a hardcover edition with bonus material. The miniseries had previously been reprinted in Italian by Italian publisher Magic Press. Fictional character biography Flex made his first appearance in Doom Patrol #36, where he appeared as a shaggy amnesiac on Danny the Street. When the false Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E., controlled by a fanatic named Darren Jones, tried to destroy Danny the Street, the Doom Patrol came in to try and put a stop to it. Seeing them battle was what gave Flex his memory back. His origin story was given in Musclebound. When Flex was still a \\"mac\\" instead of a \\"man\\", he was bullied a lot while on the beach. Tired of being scrawny, he was approached by a man who had a TV for a head and smoked three cigarinos at a time. He gave Flex a coupon to fill out to get a body building book, \\"Muscle Mystery for You\\". The instructions in the book turned Flex into the muscled strongman he is now, and he learned that when he flexed one type of muscle, he could alter reality. As he did, his \\"Hero Halo\\" appeared over him, which read \\"Hero of the Beach\\". After this, he decided to become a crimefighter and dressed in wrestling boots and leopard-skin trunks. Flex teamed up with a group of heroes, the Zipper, the Atomic Pile, Dr. 45 and his assistant Romantic Rick, and the Fact. Strangely enough, he hinted, all their adventures revolved around the color green. In 1956, while judging a swimsuit competition, Flex fell in love with and later married a woman named Dolores Watson. He was then approached by a reporter named Norman Grindstone, who was investigating the disappearance of detective Harry Christmas. Harry was \\"on to something big\\", as Norman put it, involving the Pentagon, a rash of 32 mysterious disappearances since 1949, silver sugar tongs, and an Ant Farm. Norman found Harry's conclusion about what was going on, and showed it to Flex. Both were horrified by Harry's discoveries. Soon after, Norman Grindstone was seemingly erased from existence. For two months Flex flexed about every muscle in his body trying to turn the Pentagon into a circle. Dolores left him in this time because he wouldn't stop flexing. He failed, and investigated the Pentagon up close. He was captured, however, by the (real) Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and placed inside the Tearoom of Despair. Once there, he lost his powers and his memory, and was left to wander, homeless and crazy, until he found Danny the Street. Flex eventually remembered the 32 disappearances; their number, he said, was 5, the number of sides of the Pentagon: \\"3+2=5 and that is their number. It is the number of anguish\\". After regaining his memory, he was reunited with Dolores, who returned his costume but then withered away; her parting words were \\"I love you. They made me.\\" As she said this, the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. suddenly stood in her place. They kidnapped Flex and young psychic Dorothy Spinner, bringing the two to the sub- sub basement of the Pentagon, to power the mechanical monstrosity Flex had discovered all those years ago: The Ant Farm. While given a tour of the Ant Farm by the demented Major Honey, Flex learned that he was created by a psychic named Wallace Sage inside a comic book Sage created with green ink when he was a child called \\"My Greenest Adventure\\". Sage, along with Dorothy, was kidnapped as a means to summon the Telephone Avatar, a being that has enslaved the dead and haunted the telephone system for 50 years. The Doom Patrol soon invaded the Pentagon in an attempt to rescue Flex and Dorothy; in the confusion, Flex freed Wallace, who died within minutes. Upon Wallace's death, Flex regained his powers and successfully transformed the Pentagon into a circle, but he couldn't destroy the Avatar. The Avatar was eventually destroyed by The Candlemaker, an entity that had been imprisoned within Dorothy's mind. Flex went on to star in a four-issue miniseries in its own continuity. Powers and abilities As The Man of Muscle Mystery, Flex Mentallo's powers are apparently vast but ill-defined. In a general sense, Flex can affect reality by flexing his muscles, in a reverse form of mind over matter. In the most extreme exertion of his power, he was able to transform the Pentagon into a circular building for a brief moment. When Flex uses his power, his \\"Hero Halo\\", a shimmering projection of the words \\"Hero of the Beach\\", appears above his head. In other media =Television= * Flex Mentallo appears as a cameo in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Last Patrol!\\", which focuses on the Doom Patrol and contains a number of references and in-jokes about the team's history. At one point, Batman and Niles Caulder attend a local carnival where Negative Man is working, and a large poster of Flex Mentallo is shown plastered on a wooden fence with the phrase \\"The Sensational Find of 1991!\\" scrawled across it. * Flex Mentallo appears in Doom Patrol, portrayed by Devan Chandler Long. In the episode \\"Frances Patrol,\\" Cyborg and Crazy Jane pursue Flex Mentallo until Cyborg is captured by the Bureau of Normalcy. In the episode \\"Flex Patrol,\\" a flashback revealed that the Bureau of Normalcy captured Flex Mentallo in 1964. In the present, Flex's memories were restored by Robotman, Negative Man, and Crazy Jane as they plan to reunite him with his wife Dolores. When Dolores disintegrates in front of him during their reunion, Flex unleashes his powers in his agony causing an electrical outage over a large region. In the episode \\"Penultimate Patrol,\\" Flex is still coping with the loss of Dolores as he and the Doom Patrol find Danny the Street who agrees to help them find where Mr. Nobody is holding Chief. Flex reappears in the season two episode \\"Sex Patrol\\" as one of the former Dannizens attempting to heal Danny the Brick after it is broken.

A tractor with a 10-wheeled star-wheel rake forms a windrow; Wisconsin, USA. A tractor with a rotary rake forms a windrow, another one with a loader wagon follows and collects the hay for silage. A hay rake is an agricultural rake used to collect cut hay or straw into windrows for later collection (e.g. by a baler or a loader wagon). It is also designed to fluff up the hay and turn it over so that it may dry. It is also used in the evening to protect the hay from morning dew. The next day a tedder is used to spread it again, so that the hay dries more quickly.  Types  A hay rake may be mechanized, drawn by a tractor or draft animals, or it may be a hand tool. The earliest hay rakes were nothing more than tree branches, but wooden hand rakes with wooden teeth, similar in design to a garden rake but larger, were prevalent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and still are used in some locations around the world. The typical early horse-drawn hay rake was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled implement with curved steel or iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the rake with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This rake gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation perpendicular to the windrow, requiring the operator to raise the rake, turn around and drop the teeth to rake back and forth in order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep rake, which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon. Later, a mechanically more complicated rake was developed, known as the side delivery rake. This usually had a gear-driven or chain-driven reel mounted roughly at a 45-degree angle to the windrow, so the hay was gathered and pushed to one side of the rake as it moved across the field. A side delivery rake could be pulled longitudinally along the windrow by horses or a tractor, eliminating the laborious and inefficient process of raising, lowering, and back-and-forth raking required by a dump rake. This allowed for the continuous spiraling windrows of a classic mid-20th-century farm hayfield. Later versions of the side delivery rake used a more severe transverse angle and a higher frame system, but the basic principles of operation were the same. Still later, a variety of wheel rakes or star wheel rakes were developed, with 5, 6, 7 or more spring-tooth encircled wheels mounted on a frame and ground driven by free-wheeling contact as the implement was pulled forward. These rakes were variously promoted as being mechanically simpler and trouble-free, gentler on the hay than a side-delivery rake, and cheaper to operate. Currently a newer design called the rotary rake is in common use in Europe, and less frequently seen in the United States and Canada.

It is mostly within Lesotho, with parts in the KwaZulu-Natal and Free State provinces of South Africa. The peak is accessible from the Sentinel Car Park near Witsieshoek, via chain ladders. Description The Mont-Aux-Sources is part of a basalt plateau which lies at an average elevation of about 3,050 meters (10 000 ft). Among the many escarpments that surround the plateau is a sheer wall of 330 vertical meters, known as the Amphitheatre and the Sentinel. The highest point is a peak 3 km from the Drakensberg escarpment, attaining an altitude of . Hydrography Since important rivers have their sources in the range, the mountainous area was named mont aux Sources (‚Äòfountains mountain‚Äô) by French missionaries who visited the region in 1836. Several rivers originate in the Mont-Aux-Sources, foremost of which is the Tugela, which flows eastwards into the Indian Ocean on the KwaZulu-Natal coast. Some 7 km from the Mont-Aux-Sources, the Tugela plunges 947 m in a series of falls in the Royal Natal National Park. This is the second-highest series of falls in the world. The Caledon River, one of the main tributaries of the Orange River, has its sources in this massif and flows along the border with Lesotho. Also the Seati (Khubedu), one of the headwater streams of the Orange River, has its origin near Mont-aux-Sources further to the north. Another important river is the Elands, named the Namahadi in its uppermost section in the area of the Fika-Patso Dam. The Elands flows roughly northwards into the Wilge River, one of the major tributaries of the Vaal. The Vaal River flows westwards eventually into the Orange River, which in turn flows into the Atlantic Ocean on the West coast of Southern Africa.

A judge who hands down a decision in a case soon or straight after hearing it is delivering a decision ex tempore. Another way a judge may deliver a decision is to reserve their decision and deliver it later in written form. An ex tempore judgment, being off the cuff, does not entail the same preparation as a reserved decision. Consequently, it will not be thought out to the same degree. In Australia, intermediate-level courts tend to have a heavy case load, and so many decisions are delivered ex tempore for reasons of time and necessity. Because many decisions are ex tempore, intermediate-level courts' decisions are not binding on inferior courts - that is to say, that in New South Wales, the District Court's decisions are not binding on the Local Court (see Valentine v Eid (1992) 27 NSWLR 615 and stare decisis). Ex tempore decisions are not binding on later courts due to the quick nature of their delivery after the hearing of a case. Therefore, these decisions are of persuasive authority only and a later court, dealing with a case of similar facts, can reach a different conclusion if it is appropriate and the court in question believes that their decision is more suitable.

He was also the co-commander of the French army at the Battle of Agincourt where he was killed by the English forces led by King Henry V.  Biography  Charles was born into an old Gascon family, the son of Arnaud, Lord of Albret, and Margaret de Bourbon. He served under Bertrand du Guesclin as a young man and fought at the battle of Roosebeke. He was made the constable of France by Charles VI in 1403, but dismissed when the Burgundian faction gained power at court. He was restored to his office in 1413 when the Armagnac faction regained power. An important figure at the French court, he is the subject of two of Christine de Pizan's Autres Ballades (#2 and #3). Although nominal commander of the French army in the Agincourt campaign together with Marshal Boucicaut, the two professional soldiers could not exercise effective control over the higher-ranking French nobles on the day of the battle. Constable d'Albret was killed at Agincourt during the battle on 25 October 1415, against the English troops led by King Henry V. He was interred at the Friary church in Hesdin.  Family  He married, Marie de Sully, daughter of Louis de Sully and Isabel de Craon, on 27 January 1400 and had issue: *Jeanne d'Albret (1403‚Äì1433), married in 1422 John I, Count of Foix. She was his second wife; the only one of his three wives who bore him issue. *Charles II d'Albret (1407‚Äì1471), married Anne of Armagnac (born 1402), the daughter of Bernard VII of Armagnac, Count of Charolais and Bonne of Berry, by whom he had seven children. *Guillaume d'Albret (d. 1429), Lord of Orval *Jean d'Albret *Catherine d'Albret, married Charles de Montagu (1363‚Äì1409)  In culture  Constable Charles d'Albret plays a significant role in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, as one of the leading enemies of the English. As he does not die on stage, his death is portrayed in very different ways in film adaptations of the play. Constable d'Albret was portrayed by Leo Genn in the 1944 film Henry V. The film sets up d'Albret as the most military worthy of the French warriors, but with a sneering manner and a \\"fierce and inhuman appearance\\" in black armour with a pointed visor. He is killed in single combat with Henry, played by Laurence Olivier. His distinctive black armour is later taken and worn by Ancient Pistol. He is played by Richard Easton in the 1989 film Henry V. Constable d'Albret's death at Agincourt is vividly depicted in the film which starred Kenneth Branagh in the title role. He is rescued mortally wounded from the muddy battlefield, only to die in shamed despair among other shocked French aristocrats. In the 2012 TV film of Henry V, concluding the series The Hollow Crown, he is played by Maxime Lefrancois. His death is portrayed in an unheroic light. In a wood away from the main action, he stabs the Duke of York in the back during the final stages of the conflict, only to be shot in the back by a longbowman as he prepares to kill the only witness, a young page. The page is later revealed to be the Chorus, remembering the events as an old man after the disasters of Henry VI's reign.

Thus it is a topological space in which each point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open set in a Banach space (a more involved and formal definition is given below). Banach manifolds are one possibility of extending manifolds to infinite dimensions. A further generalisation is to Fr√©chet manifolds, replacing Banach spaces by Fr√©chet spaces. On the other hand, a Hilbert manifold is a special case of a Banach manifold in which the manifold is locally modelled on Hilbert spaces. Definition Let X be a set. An atlas of class Cr, r ‚â• 0, on X is a collection of pairs (called charts) (Ui, œÜi), i ‚àà I, such that # each Ui is a subset of X and the union of the Ui is the whole of X; # each œÜi is a bijection from Ui onto an open subset œÜi(Ui) of some Banach space Ei, and for any i and j, œÜi(Ui ‚à© Uj) is open in Ei; # the crossover map ::\\\\varphi_{j} \\\\circ \\\\varphi_{i}^{-1} : \\\\varphi_{i} (U_{i} \\\\cap U_{j}) \\\\to \\\\varphi_{j} (U_{i} \\\\cap U_{j}) : is an r-times continuously differentiable function for every i and j in I, i.e. the rth Fr√©chet derivative ::\\\\mathrm{d}^{r} \\\\big( \\\\varphi_{j} \\\\circ \\\\varphi_{i}^{-1} \\\\big) : \\\\varphi_{i} (U_{i} \\\\cap U_{j}) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Lin} \\\\big( E_{i}^{r}; E_{j} \\\\big) : exists and is a continuous function with respect to the Ei-norm topology on subsets of Ei and the operator norm topology on Lin(Eir; Ej.) One can then show that there is a unique topology on X such that each Ui is open and each œÜi is a homeomorphism. Very often, this topological space is assumed to be a Hausdorff space, but this is not necessary from the point of view of the formal definition. If all the Banach spaces Ei are equal to the same space E, the atlas is called an E-atlas. However, it is not a priori necessary that the Banach spaces Ei be the same space, or even isomorphic as topological vector spaces. However, if two charts (Ui, œÜi) and (Uj, œÜj) are such that Ui and Uj have a non-empty intersection, a quick examination of the derivative of the crossover map :\\\\varphi_{j} \\\\circ \\\\varphi_{i}^{-1} : \\\\varphi_{i} (U_{i} \\\\cap U_{j}) \\\\to \\\\varphi_{j} (U_{i} \\\\cap U_{j}) shows that Ei and Ej must indeed be isomorphic as topological vector spaces. Furthermore, the set of points x ‚àà X for which there is a chart (Ui, œÜi) with x in Ui and Ei isomorphic to a given Banach space E is both open and closed. Hence, one can without loss of generality assume that, on each connected component of X, the atlas is an E-atlas for some fixed E. A new chart (U, œÜ) is called compatible with a given atlas { (Ui, œÜi)  i ‚àà I } if the crossover map :\\\\varphi_{i} \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1} : \\\\varphi (U \\\\cap U_{i}) \\\\to \\\\varphi_{i} (U \\\\cap U_{i}) is an r-times continuously differentiable function for every i ‚àà I. Two atlases are called compatible if every chart in one is compatible with the other atlas. Compatibility defines an equivalence relation on the class of all possible atlases on X. A Cr-manifold structure on X is then defined to be a choice of equivalence class of atlases on X of class Cr. If all the Banach spaces Ei are isomorphic as topological vector spaces (which is guaranteed to be the case if X is connected), then an equivalent atlas can be found for which they are all equal to some Banach space E. X is then called an E-manifold, or one says that X is modeled on E. Examples * If (X, ‚ãÖ) is a Banach space, then X is a Banach manifold with an atlas containing a single, globally-defined chart (the identity map). * Similarly, if U is an open subset of some Banach space, then U is a Banach manifold. (See the classification theorem below.) Classification up to homeomorphism It is by no means true that a finite- dimensional manifold of dimension n is globally homeomorphic to Rn, or even an open subset of Rn. However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify ‚Äúwell-behaved‚Äù Banach manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely. A 1969 theorem of David Henderson states that every infinite-dimensional, separable, metric Banach manifold X can be embedded as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space, H (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space, usually identified with \\\\ell^2). In fact, Henderson's result is stronger: the same conclusion holds for any metric manifold modeled on a separable infinite-dimensional Fr√©chet space. The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for X. Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, the ‚Äúonly‚Äù Banach manifolds are the open subsets of Hilbert space.

Thus it is a separable Hausdorff space in which each point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The concept of a Hilbert manifold provides a possibility of extending the theory of manifolds to infinite-dimensional setting. Analogously to the finite-dimensional situation, one can define a differentiable Hilbert manifold by considering a maximal atlas in which the transition maps are differentiable.  Properties  Many basic constructions of the manifold theory, such as the tangent space of a manifold and a tubular neighbourhood of a submanifold (of finite codimension) carry over from the finite dimensional situation to the Hilbert setting with little change. However, in statements involving maps between manifolds, one often has to restrict consideration to Fredholm maps, i.e. maps whose differential at every point is Fredholm. The reason for this is that Sard's lemma holds for Fredholm maps, but not in general. Notwithstanding this difference, Hilbert manifolds have several very nice properties. * Kuiper's theorem: If X is a compact topological space or has the homotopy type of a CW complex then every (real or complex) Hilbert space bundle over X is trivial. In particular, every Hilbert manifold is parallelizable. * Every smooth Hilbert manifold can be smoothly embedded onto an open subset of the model Hilbert space. * Every homotopy equivalence between two Hilbert manifolds is homotopic to a diffeomorphism. In particular every two homotopy equivalent Hilbert manifolds are already diffeomorphic. This stands in contrast to lens spaces and exotic spheres, which demonstrate that in the finite-dimensional situation, homotopy equivalence, homeomorphism, and diffeomorphism of manifolds are distinct properties. * Although Sard's Theorem does not hold in general, every continuous map f : X ‚Üí Rn from a Hilbert manifold can be arbitrary closely approximated by a smooth map g : X ‚Üí Rn which has no critical points Examples * Any Hilbert space H is a Hilbert manifold with a single global chart given by the identity function on H. Moreover, since H is a vector space, the tangent space TpH to H at any point p ‚àà H is canonically isomorphic to H itself, and so has a natural inner product, the \\"same\\" as the one on H. Thus, H can be given the structure of a Riemannian manifold with metric ::g(v, w)(p) := \\\\langle v, w \\\\rangle_{H} \\\\text{ for } v, w \\\\in \\\\mathrm{T}_{p} H, : where ‚ü®*, *‚ü©H denotes the inner product in H. * Similarly, any open subset of a Hilbert space is a Hilbert manifold and a Riemannian manifold under the same construction as for the whole space. * There are several mapping spaces between manifolds which can be viewed as Hilbert spaces by only considering maps of suitable Sobolev class. For example we can consider the space LM of all H1 maps from the unit circle S1 into a manifold M. This can be topologized via the compact open topology as a subspace of the space of all continuous mappings from the circle to M, i.e. the free loop space of M. The Sobolev kind mapping space LM described above is homotopy equivalent to the free loop space. This makes it suited to the study of algebraic topology of the free loop space, especially in the field of string topology. We can do an analogous Sobolev construction for the loop space, making it a codimension d Hilbert submanifold of LM, where d is the dimension of M. See also *Banach manifold References *.

By far the largest group of trees in the park are the English elm. Glebe Park is a public park on the eastern side of Civic, Canberra, Australia. The park is bounded by Coranderrk, Ballumbir, Akuna, and Bunda Streets, and to the south, the National Convention Centre. History Glebe Park is a remnant of a hundred acres (40 hectares) of land allocated by Robert Campbell to the Anglican Church in the early 1840s for use as a glebe, an area of land whose revenues contribute towards parish expenses. Campbell gave two acres (8,000 m¬≤) of land to St John the Baptist Church in nearby Reid at the same time. An open area of Glebe Park The park's deciduous trees lose their leaves in winter and provide strong autumn foliage colour. 1989 landscaping changes included a fence and gates. A gazebo (built 1989) is located at the centre of Glebe Park. The park as viewed from above during autumn, looking out towards Mount Ainslie. Glebe House was built in 1871-3 as a rectory for St John's church. It was a two storied house with a single storied veranda made of bricks from nearby swampland clay. The land was used as a farm to support the rector. Elms, willows, and poplars were planted around the house by the Reverend Pierce Galliard Smith, who was Rector at St Johns for fifty-one years from 1855 until 1906. The elms in the park today are descended from his plantings with some survivors from one hundred years ago. Nearly seven hundred trees remain in the park, of which just over five hundred are English elms (Ulmus procera). About a hundred are English oaks (Quercus robur). In 1912, when the decision had been made to site Australia's capital here, the land and building were resumed by the Commonwealth Government but was continued to be used as a rectory until a new rectory much closer to the church was built in 1926. From 1926 to early 1928 the Old Rectory at St Johns was leased from the Government by the Anglican religious order of the Community of the Sisters of the Church, or the Kilburn Sisters, to found St Gabriel's school which later became the Canberra Girls' Grammar School. The school moved into its Deakin premises on Melbourne Avenue in 1928. Glebe House then served as a guest house for the next 25 years. By 1954 it was in a poor state of repair and there had been a number of additions that were not in harmony with the original building. The House also stood in the way of plans for the development of the city area. There was some protest at destroying a building associated with Canberra's early history and some discussion about alternate uses such as a residence for the aged. However, the building was sold by the Commonwealth government to the Acton Football Club. The club used the bricks to construct a clubhouse in Franklin Street, Forrest. A plaque was erected ten years later in Ballumbir Street, Reid, just to the south of St Peter's Lutheran Church, to mark the site of the former building. Recent history A community campaign to save the trees resulted in a park being proclaimed in 1983 and heritage listing by the National Trust of Australia (ACT) and the Australian Heritage Commission. Formal landscaping with fences, gates, paths, a rotunda, and a playground was completed in 1989. The park has ten gates, which are named after historic people or places. In the course of the landscaping, further land was excised for the building of the National Convention Centre, a casino and a hotel (at present, the Crowne Plaza). The present area is about 4.7 hectares, just under one eighth of the original area of the glebe. =Uses= A children's playground has now been built in the park. In recent years outdoor art exhibitions have been staged in the park, notably during the Canberra Festival. 2017 saw the Canberra Christmas activation move from City Walk into the park for Christmas In Glebe Park, With a more family focused event running for 3 weekends and supporting Red Nose as the charity partner.

Emerson became the sole proprietor in 1855. By the 1870s there were more than forty retail departments. Emerson Bainbridge died in 1892 and his sons took over the business. In that same year, Bainbridge's employed a staff of 600 in Newcastle, and the store had 11,705 square yards of floor space. In 1897 the business became a private limited company. During the Depression, which hit the Newcastle area badly, the store introduced agents who operated in less prosperous areas, collecting payments in weekly instalments. This meant that people on low incomes could continue to buy from the shop and it kept the Bainbridge name and reputation known in areas where otherwise it might have faded away. In 1952 an offer from the John Lewis Partnership was accepted and ownership transferred to John Lewis in the following year, although the store continued to operate under the Bainbridge brand alongside the words \\"A branch of the John Lewis Partnership\\". The John Lewis takeover allowed much needed capital investment into the store, making it into one of the leading department stores in the UK by 1974. In 1976 the store was relocated to the Eldon Square shopping centre in the city, and was at the time the largest John Lewis store outside London. In 2002 further refurbishment took place, and in the same year (following a suggestion from the store partners) the store was re-branded as John Lewis. At the time of its demise, the Bainbridge name was one of the longest continuously traded department store brands in the world. In 2008, a Waitrose supermarket, also owned by the John Lewis Partnership, opened in an extension to Eldon Square, constructed in the undercroft area that was formerly occupied by Eldon Square bus station. The Waitrose is across the mall from the basement entrance of John Lewis, but is not linked to it directly.

Usually, it is distinguished from mass communication research, which tends to approach the topic from a social sciences perspective. Defining the field is problematic; some institutions and syllabuses do not distinguish it from media studies or classify it as a subfield of popular culture studies. One form of television studies is roughly equivalent to the longer-standing discipline of film studies in that it is often concerned with textual analysis yet other approaches center more on the social functions of television.Brunsdon, Charlotte (2004). Television Studies. In Horace Newcomb (Ed.), The Encyclopedia of Television[second edition]. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2299‚Äì304. For example, analyses of quality television, such as Cathy Come Home and Twin Peaks, have attracted the interests of researchers for their cinematic qualities. However, television studies can also incorporate the study of television viewing and how audiences make meaning from texts, which is commonly known as audience theory or reception theory. History Charlotte Brunsdon argues that television studies is an \\"aspirationally disciplinary name given to the academic study of television.\\" Since it is a relatively new discipline, Brunsdon notes that \\"...many of the key television scholars are employed in departments of sociology, politics, communication arts, speech, theatre, media and film studies.\\" She argues that television studies developed during the 1970s and 1980s \\"...from three major bodies of commentary on television: journalism, literary/dramatic criticism and the social sciences.\\" Critical methods for television have been \\"...extrapolated from traditional literary and dramatic criticism.\\"Television Studies Horace Newcomb argues that television studies scholars often need to justify their academic focus: \\"[T]he mere suggestion that television needs analysis itself requires supportive argument.\\"Horace Newcomb, ‚ÄúThe Development of Television Studies,‚Äù in A Companion to Television, ed. Janet Wasko (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing), p. 16. As a result, television studies is marked by a great deal of \\"disciplinary hybridity.\\" Perhaps because television scholars are approaching the subject from so many different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives, there are many debates about how television should be understood and conceptualized from a political and methodological point of view. Another impact of the disciplinary hybridity is the diversity in the types of studies carried out. Early television studies included histories of television, biographies of television producers, archival research by historians, and sociological studies of the role the television set played in 1950s homes. In television studies, television and other mass media forms are \\"...conceptualised within frameworks\\" such as \\"...ownership; national and international regulation of media production and distribution; professional ideologies; public opinion; [and] media audiences.\\" As the field of television studies was being developed, it was influenced by the medium's longstanding issue of invoking \\"distrust, fear and contempt\\", as a purported cause of social ills. As well, television scholars had to prove that television was different from other \\"mass media\\", often by pointing to how television differed from radio and cinema. In the 1970s and 1980s, television studies developed three strands of commentary: * A journalistic approach, which reviews recent television programs * A literary and dramatic criticism approach, which examines the television screenwriter in the same way that literary and dramatic criticism examines novels and plays *A social science approach, which examines production and distribution, and the function of television in society. The social science stream examined the social function and effects of television and analyzed the role that television plays in the social order and the public sphere. Some television scholars applied Marxist frameworks or the \\"critical sociology of the Frankfurt School\\". Since the 1970s, feminist television scholars have focused \\"... on programmes for women and those which have key female protagonists\\", such as Julie D'Acci's study of the police drama Cagney and Lacey and the \\"...now substantial literature on soap opera.\\" Television studies in the 1990s includes \\"work on the definition and interpretation of the television text and the new media ethnographies of viewing\\" and histories of \\"production studies\\" - how television shows are developed, financed, and produced. While some predicted the end of television (or at least of the broadcast TV), some scholars claim that television \\"has never been so healthy and triumphant as nowadays\\".

A World of Chess, p.324. McFarland. . Chess960 (Fischer random chess) is similar but has fewer starting positions. In transcendental chess the beginning positions of the pieces on the back row are randomly determined, with the one restriction that the bishops be on opposite-colored squares. There are 8,294,400 such positions in total. In Chess960 there are 960 possible starting positions, but that is because the king must be located between the rooks and both sides must have the same starting position. In transcendental chess there is no such rule so the position of one side can be any of 42√ó6!√∑22 = 2,880. There is no castling. On the first turn a player, instead of making a move, can transpose any of two pieces on the back row. In Chess960 the back rows are mirror images, but in transcendental chess the setup of black and white is different 2,879 out of every 2,880 times (there being a 1-in-2,880 chance that both sides will draw the same setup). This can create inequalities in the position. One way to equalize these inequalities is to play a couplet: the players play two games with the same setup, one each as white and as black. To win the couplet, a player must win at least one game and draw or win the other. The other way to equalize the opening positions is auction transcendental chess, in which each player bids to give their opponent extra opening moves in order to play the side of the board they want.Pritchard (1994), p. 13 In orthodox chess, innovations in opening play are increasingly hard to come by, with most good players having processed an extensive catalogue of opening moves‚Äînovelties tend to occur later in the game. Transcendental chess offers opening complexity and novelty immediately because every game starts in a dense and unfamiliar position.  Variations  * D-chess: Similar to transcendental chess, but only one game is needed to be played against each opponent as the unequal starting positions are equalized with the weaker side having the option to transpose two pieces and then gets to move first.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 29, 2003. In the episode, the kids start a rock band, but concerned with the fact that people will potentially download their music from the Internet illegally, they refuse to play. Meanwhile, Cartman starts his own Christian rock band, called Faith + 1. The episode satirizes famous artists who have spoken out against copyright infringement, such as Metallica, and also serves as a commentary on how most musicians do what they do mainly for profit gains. Christian rock music is also parodied as being identical to love songs, except for referencing Jesus in their lyrics.IMDB source for episode Retrieved 2012-02-19 Plot Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman form a band called Moop, but disagree on what direction they should take, as they all like different types of music. The disagreement becomes so heated that Cartman bets that he will have a platinum- selling Christian rock album before Kyle's band does, and leaves the band. Seeking inspiration, Stan, Kyle and Kenny illegally download music from the Internet, and are immediately busted by the FBI. They are told of the serious consequences of illegal downloading, namely forcing musicians like Lars Ulrich (drummer of metal band Metallica) and Britney Spears to lose so much income from music piracy that they must either downgrade their extremely lavish purchases to very-slightly less lavish ones or save up until they can afford all of what they want. As a result, Moop decides to go on strike until fans stop downloading illegally and are joined by a large number of musicians, including Britney Spears, Ozzy Osbourne, Missy Elliott, Master P, Blink-182, Metallica, Alanis Morissette, Meat Loaf, Rancid as well as Skyler's band (Lords of the Underworld). Meanwhile, Cartman enlists Butters and Token to form his new band. Realizing that Christian rock is a perennial top seller, Cartman decides that his band, which he has christened Faith + 1, will join the Christian music racket. Cartman builds the band's repertoire by simply taking vague generic pop love ballads and changing references like \\"baby\\" to \\"Jesus\\". While effective, the band eventually comes under some scrutiny when one of the songs involves more passionate and sexual lyrics involving Christ. Cartman manages to manipulate his way out and the band begins to build a huge following. Before long, Faith + 1 celebrates the sale of its millionth album. By this time, Stan, Kyle and Kenny decide that the satisfaction of having fans should be more important to musicians than fighting against the fans who make them popular and go to see their concerts. They decide that touring still brings in revenue and call off their strike. However, the other musicians do not follow suit, because, according to Britney Spears, \\"[they are] just about the money.\\" Cartman has spent all the money made from their album on a lavish, extravagant awards ceremony to celebrate Faith + 1's success, and specifically to insult Kyle for losing the bet to Cartman. However, Cartman's jubilation is short-lived. As it turns out, Cartman is told that Christian record companies only hand out gold, frankincense and myrrh records, so Faith + 1, as Christian artists, will never have a platinum album, meaning that Kyle technically did not lose the bet and never will. Cartman, enraged at this turn of events, destroys the band's myrrh album award, screaming \\"Goddammit!\\" and \\"Fuck Jesus!\\". This blasphemy causes the horrified fans to scream and flee. When Token confronts Cartman for spending every penny of their take, driving away their fans and ending the career of the band, Cartman continues to rant and insults him by calling him a \\"black asshole\\". In response, Token assaults Cartman on the stage before walking away. Conceding that Cartman got what he deserved, Stan, Kenny and Kyle also leave. As Cartman lies moaning in pain on the stage, Butters approaches him meekly. Butters then farts in Cartman's face, gives him the finger, and says \\"Fuck you, Eric.\\", before walking away himself, leaving Cartman all alone to recover from his pain and humiliation. Cultural references * Eric Cartman's instructions for the Faith + 1 album cover are a reference to the U2 album The Joshua Tree. * The joke that Christian record companies only award gold, frankincense and myrrh records is a reference to the gifts given to Jesus by the Three Kings in The Nativity. * When Officer Yates takes the boys around to show them the lives of celebrities financially affected by illegally downloaded music, the scene is reminiscent of the three ghosts in Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol showing Ebenezer Scrooge the ramifications of his selfish actions. * Token's bass is fashioned after the bass Rudy played in the cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.Rudy on Fat Albert Wiki. * The scene where Eric Cartman is on the bus writing lyrics on the palm of his hand is a reference to American rapper Eminem's semi-autobiographical film 8 Mile. In the movie, there was a scene where Eminem's character was also on a bus, wearing headphones, staring out the window and cramming lyrics onto a small piece of paper while on his way to work. * Faith + 1's songs are based on real-life songs, with the lyrics changed. ** \\"Three Times My Savior\\" is based on \\"Three Times a Lady\\" by Lionel Richie. ** \\"I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday\\" is based on \\"I've Never Been To Me\\" by Charlene. ** \\"Jesus Baby\\" is based on \\"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)\\" by The Delfonics. * The name \\"Faith + 1 is reference to the Christian boyband Plus One.

This includes high blood pressure in pregnancy and very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms. It has been found to be particularly useful in heart failure, together with isosorbide dinitrate, for treatment of people of African descent. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Effects usually begin around 15 minutes and last up to six hours. Common side effects include headache and fast heart rate. It is not recommended in people with coronary artery disease or in those with rheumatic heart disease that affects the mitral valve. In those with kidney disease a low dose is recommended. Hydralazine is in the vasodilator family of medications, so is believed to work by causing the dilation of blood vessels. Hydralazine was discovered while scientists at Ciba were looking for a treatment for malaria. It was patented in 1949. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than seven million prescriptions.  Medical use  Hydralazine is not used as a primary drug for treating hypertension because it elicits a reflex sympathetic stimulation of the heart (the baroreceptor reflex). The sympathetic stimulation may increase heart rate and cardiac output, and in people with coronary artery disease may cause angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Hydralazine may also increase plasma renin concentration, resulting in fluid retention. To prevent these undesirable side effects, hydralazine is usually prescribed in combination with a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol) and a diuretic. Beta-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol. Hydralazine is used to treat severe hypertension, but is not a first-line therapy for essential hypertension. Hydralazine is often used to treat hypertension in pregnancy, though, with methyldopa. Hydralazine is commonly used in combination with isosorbide dinitrate for the treatment of congestive heart failure in self-identified African-American populations. This preparation, isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine, was the first race-based prescription drug. It should not be used in people who have tachycardia, heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, lupus, a dissecting aortic aneurysm, or porphyria.  Adverse effects  Prolonged treatment may cause a syndrome similar to lupus, which can become fatal if the symptoms are not noticed and drug treatment stopped. Very common (>10% frequency) side effects include headache, tachycardia, and palpitations. Common (1‚Äì10% frequency) side effects include flushing, hypotension, anginal symptoms, aching or swelling joints, muscle aches, positive tests for atrial natriuretic peptide, stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and swelling (sodium and water retention).  Interactions  It may potentiate the antihypertensive effects of: * Vasodilators * Calcium antagonists * ACE inhibitors * Diuretics * Antihypertensives * Tricyclic antidepressants * Major tranquillisers * Ethanol (alcohol) * Diazoxide Drugs subject to a strong first-pass effect such as beta blockers may increase the bioavailability of hydralazine. Epinephrine (adrenaline), by its heart rate-accelerating effects as increased by hydralazine, may lead to toxicity.  Mechanism of action  It is a direct- acting smooth muscle relaxant and acts as a vasodilator primarily in resistance arterioles; the molecular mechanism involves inhibition of inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in arterial smooth muscle cells. By relaxing vascular smooth muscle, vasodilators act to decrease peripheral resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure and decreasing afterload. Chemistry Hydralazine belongs to the hydrazinophthalazine class of drugs. History The antihypertensive activity of hydralazine was discovered by scientists at Ciba, who were trying to discover drugs to treat malaria; it was initially called C-5968 and 1-hydrazinophthalazine; Ciba's patent application was filed in 1945 and issued in 1949,US2484029; see Example 1 and the first scientific publications of its blood pressure-lowering activities appeared in 1950. It was approved by the FDA in 1953. It was one of the first antihypertensive medications that could be taken by mouth. Research Hydralazine has also been studied as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome in its capacity as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.

He was the headmaster of Wellington College from 1892 to 1920. He was born and died in Wellington. Early life and family Born in Wellington on 25 March 1859, Firth was the son of Aaron Firth, a stonemason, and Ann Firth (n√©e Priestnell). The family moved to Cobden on the South Island's West Coast during the West Coast Gold Rush of 1864 to 1867. On 8 May 1889, Firth married Janet McRae at the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Christchurch. The couple did not have any children. Education and teaching career Firth won a scholarship to Nelson College, and was a pupil there from 1873 to 1875.Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856‚Äì2006, 6th edition He taught there as a pupil-teacher until 1881, when he went to Wellington College as a junior master. In 1886, he took up a post at Christ's College, Christchurch, and began studying for his BA at Canterbury College, graduating in 1889. He was asked to become headmaster of Wellington College in 1892. Among the boys at Wellington College he gained the nickname \\"Pentland\\" from his teaching about the troubles the Spanish Armada encountered around Pentland Firth in the north of Scotland. Thereafter he signed his name \\"J.P. Firth\\". Sporting career =Cricket= Firth played six first-class cricket matches between 1880 and 1886, five for Wellington and one for Nelson. By far the best performance of his career came for Wellington against Hawke's Bay in February 1884, when he ran through the second innings with figures of 8 for 13. Captaining Wellington against Nelson in March 1885, he opened both batting and bowling, taking 3 for 27 and 2 for 19 and making 20 and 54, the highest score in the match. In the second innings he and William Salmon put on 100 for the first wicket, the first century stand made by Wellington batsmen for any wicket.Free Lance (Wellington), 30 December 1914, p. 19. =International Olympic Committee= Firth was the representative from New Zealand on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1923 to 1927; his appointment by the IOC was delayed as he was quoted in a local newspaper that he was the delegate from New Zealand before he went (representatives are appointed by the IOC itself, not by the national Olympic committee). Honours In the 1922 King's Birthday Honours Firth was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for public services. Death Firth suffered from Parkinson's disease, and he died in Wellington on 13 April 1931. References External links * * Joseph Firth at Cricinfo  Further reading  * Beasley, A. W.

As this quantity cannot be measured directly, it has to be estimated from other parameters measured prior to drilling or after production has begun. Prior to oil production from a new reservoir, volumetric methods are used to estimate oil-in-place. A series of test drills are used to map the rock conditions at and around the drilling site and to estimate the size of the oil-bearing rock field. The oil in place is calculated as the product of the volume of porous oil-bearing rock, the porosity of the rock, and its saturation. Correction factors have to be applied for the difference between the volume of the same mass of oil in the reservoir to its volume when brought to the surface, which is caused by the different physical conditions (temperature, pressure) there. Oil-in-place is also known as stock tank original oil-in-place (STOOIP) or stock tank oil-initially-in-place (STOIIP), referring to the oil in place before the commencement of production. In this case, stock tank barrels refers to the volume of oil after production, at surface pressure and temperature (as opposed to reservoir conditions). After production has begun, the change in reservoir pressure over time and the history of production from that reservoir can be used to estimate the total oil-in-place using the materials balance method. Alternatively, the production history can be fitted to a curve to estimate future oil production (decline curve method). The analogous term original gas-in-place (OGIP) is used to refer to the total natural gas in a reservoir. Furthermore, there is a term called Hydrocarbons Initially in Place (HCIIP) that is used for either oil or gas. Similar to OIP, HCIIP is calculated using measures of the total reservoirs volume correcting for the non reservoir rock, the porosity and the water saturation in this pore space. Lastly the volume at reservoir conditions (high pressures and temperatures) is converted to the associated volume at surface conditions.HCIIP Calculation and Formula on the Petroleum Geology Forums Oil in place must not be confused with oil reserves, that are the technically and economically recoverable portion of oil volume in the reservoir. Current recovery factors for oil fields around the world typically range between 10 and 60 percent; some are over 80 percent. The wide variance is due largely to the diversity of fluid and reservoir characteristics for different deposits. See also *Stock Tank Oil References External links *Reserves estimation at AAPG Wiki.

It is widely considered a landmark release in metalcore.  Music and lyrics  Earth Crisis recorded Destroy the Machines in the studio of progressive thrash metal band Believer in Pennsylvania, being introduced to them by friend Jim Winters of Conviction, who also toured with Earth Crisis. Guitarist Scott Crouse, who admired Believer, was inspired by them to practice arduously and improve his technique. On the album, the band determined to make the songs sound like \\"somebody continuously hitting something with a hammer\\", picturing every song as \\"pounding, pounding, [and] pounding.\\" MetalSucks described Destroy the Machines as a \\"hardcore take on the Pantera/Exhorder/Prong school of late 80s-early 90s power groove thrash\\". Commenting on the lyrics, Allmusic stated that \\"[they] burn with resentment directed at those who (in the estimation of vocalist Karl Buechner) bring contamination and death to the earth and the defenseless creatures that reside on it.\\" The overall theme is an approaching ecological apocalypse, the destruction of defenseless creatures, self- destruction, and a means of liberation which is proposed as being veganism and straight edge. By the time of the tour in 1995, Buechner was personally taking care of twelve rescued animals from Syracuse Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, where he volunteered.  Legacy  In April 2018, NME named Destroy the Machines one of the fifteen best hardcore punk albums of all time. Kerrang! placed it among \\"The 21 Best U.S. Metalcore Albums of All Time.\\" In 2017, Loudwire ranked Destroy the Machines 7th on its list of the best metalcore albums of all time. Dan Gump of Life Sentence Records named it the most representative album of the 1990s. The Duch band Born from Pain and the Argentinian band Nueva √âtica (\\"New Ethic\\" in Spanish) are named after songs from the album. In March 2015, celebrating the release of The Discipline EP which re-released songs from Destroy the Machines, several musicians and animal right activists paid tribute to it, including Davey Havok of AFI, Andy Hurley of Fall Out Boy, Peter Daniel Young and Toby Morse of H2O. The song \\"Forced March\\" was covered by Between the Buried and Me on their 2006 album The Anatomy Of and \\"The Wrath of Sanity\\" was covered by First Blood on their 2012 album FBI Vol. 1. \\"The Wrath of Sanity\\" is quoted in the songs \\"No Contest\\" (2005) by Gather and \\"Rules of Conviction\\" (2017) by First Blood and Jesse Barnett, the latter of which was dedicated to Earth Crisis and Path of Resistance. Maroon quotes Destroy the Machines in their 2006 song \\"24HourHate\\". An increase of animal rights activism corresponded with the rise of vegan straight edge bands during the 1990s, a phenomenon which activist Peter Daniel Young attributes largely to Destroy the Machines.

Imperial Order of Guadalupe Cross of \\"National Order of Our Lady of Guadalupe\\" *85px The Order of Guadalupe (originally: \\"National Order of Our Lady of Guadalupe\\") was established by Emperor Agust√≠n I of Mexico in the fall of 1821, although its statutes would not be published until February 1822. It was originally divided into two classes: Grand Cross and Numerary Member. After the death of the Agustin I, the Order fell out of use and remained inactive for 30 years until Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna convinced Pope Pius IX to recognize it in 1854. It fell into disuse again in August of that same year after the successful Ayutla Revolution and the ousting of Santa Anna from government. The third and last period of the Order began on June 30, 1863, before the arrival of Maximilian I, by decree of the Provisional Imperial Government. Maximilian I modified the statutes of the Order for the last time on April 10, 1865, renaming the order \\"Imperial\\" (instead of \\"National\\") and divided it into four ranks, each with civilian and military divisions: * Grand Cross, limited to 30 recipients. * Grand Officer, limited to 100 recipients. * Commander, limited to 200 recipients. * Knight, limited to 500 recipients. Among those who received this honour were Vicente Guerrero, Agust√≠n de Iturbide, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, and Leopold I of Belgium. Imperial Order of the Mexican Eagle *85px The Imperial Order of the Mexican Eagle was created by Maximilian I on January 1, 1865. It consisted of two classes: the Superior Class only available to Heads of State, awarded a Grand Cross with Collar; and the Ordinary Class, consisting of the following ranks: * Grand Cross * Grand Officer * Commander * Officer * Knight The award survives partially (in name at least) in the modern Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle. Imperial Order of Saint Charles Cross of the Order of Saint Charles *85px The Imperial Order of Saint Charles was created by Maximilian I on April 10, 1866. It was awarded exclusively to women who excelled in the service of their community. The Order honoured Saint Charles Borromeo, Patron Saint of Empress Carlota, sovereign of the Order.

It was later released on cassette and CD, most recently by BBC Audio and free with the 27 April 2010 edition of The Daily Telegraph newspaper via WHSmith. Synopsis The Sixth Doctor and Peri arrive on a mysterious space liner, where intergalactic policemen are investigating art thefts, a computer is suffering from a split personality and the Captain's disease threatens every living thing on the ship‚Ä¶ Production Slipback was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, four months after the final episode of Doctor Who's twenty-second season, during the programme's enforced hiatus, the next season not airing for another a year and a half. It was the first Doctor Who serial produced as a radio play (an earlier audio production, The Pescatons, was released as a story record). No further radio productions were mounted until the mid-1990s when Jon Pertwee reprised his role as the Third Doctor in two productions. =Writing= The story was written by series script writer Eric Saward, whose writing credits include The Visitation, Earthshock, Resurrection of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks. =Cast note= Valentine Dyall played the Black Guardian in the television series. Dyall died in June 1985, a month before Slipback aired. In print A novelisation by Eric Saward was published by Target Books in April 1986, the first novelisation of a non-televised Doctor Who story. Saward's novelisation expands on the radio play greatly, with an extensive prologue running about a third of the book before the Doctor appears and the adaptation of the radio play storyline begins. Audio releases Slipback was released in November 1988 on a double audio cassette along with the 1978 LP version of Genesis of the Daleks.

Overview In 1969 the USAF was developing the F-15 Eagle fighter. Planned as the ultimate air superiority aircraft, the F-15 was intended to be as perfect as possible in every respect. Rather than rely on the existing AIM-9 Sidewinder, it was decided to develop an entirely new short-range air-to-air missile to equip the aircraft. The AIM-82 was to be an all-aspect missile, capable of locking onto the target from any angle‚ÄîSidewinders of this period could only achieve a target lock if fired from almost directly behind the target where the heat of the engines provided a large infrared signature to the missile's seeker head. Infrared guidance would give the missile a fire-and-forget capability, allowing the firing aircraft to break contact as soon as it was launched. In 1970 a development contract was awarded to General Dynamics, Hughes Aircraft and Philco-Ford. Proposals were submitted later that year, but in that September the AIM-82 was canceled. The main reason was the existence of the United States Navy AIM-95 Agile program, which was developing a new short-range air-to-air missile for the F-14 Tomcat. Inter-service rivalry aside, there seemed little point in developing two missiles to perform essentially identical roles, so development on the AIM-95 was authorized. Eventually, the AIM-95 was also canceled and the AIM-9 was updated to remain in service‚Äîand indeed remains in service to this day. Specifications The AIM-82 was canceled at a stage where the basic design had not been selected; as a result, no specifications exist for the proposed missile.

Gribbin (born 19 March 1946) is a British science writer, an astrophysicist, and a visiting fellow in astronomy at the University of Sussex.\\"A change in the weather by Gary Turbak\\" The Rotarian magazine, Aug 1980, p.17 His writings include quantum physics, human evolution, climate change, global warming, the origins of the universe, and biographies of famous scientists. He also writes science fiction.  Biography  John Gribbin graduated with his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Sussex in 1966. Gribbin then earned his master of science (MSc) degree in astronomy in 1967, also from the Univ. of Sussex, and he earned his PhD in astrophysics from the University of Cambridge (1971).Profile of John Gribbin at David Higham In 1968, Gribbin worked as one of Fred Hoyle's research students at the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, and wrote a number of stories for New Scientist about the Institute's research and what were eventually discovered to be pulsars. In 1974, Gribbin, along with Stephen Plagemann, published a book titled The Jupiter Effect, which predicted that the alignment of the planets in a quadrant on one side of the Sun on 10 March 1982 would cause gravitational effects that would trigger earthquakes in the San Andreas Fault, possibly wiping out Los Angeles and its suburbs. Gribbin distanced himself from The Jupiter Effect in the 17 July 1980, issue of New Scientist magazine, stating that he had been \\"too clever by half\\". In February 1982, he and Plagemann published The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered, claiming that the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption proved their theory true despite a lack of planetary alignment. In 1999, Gribbin repudiated it, saying \\"I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.\\" In 1984, Gribbin published In Search of Schr√∂dinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality. The Spectator Book Club described it as among the best of the first wave of physics popularisations preceding Stephen Hawking's multi-million-selling A Brief History of Time. Gribbin's book was cited by BBC World News as an example of how to revive an interest in the study of mathematics. In 2006, Gribbin took part in a BBC radio 4 broadcast as an \\"expert witness\\". Presenter Matthew Parris discussed with Professor Kathy Sykes and Gribbin whether Albert Einstein \\"really was a 'crazy genius. In the BBC radio 4 broadcast, Parris refers to Gribbin as their \\"expert witness\\". This is not to downplay the impressive credentials mentioned for Kathy Sykes. At the 2009 World Conference of Science Journalists, the Association of British Science Writers presented Gribbin with their Lifetime Achievement award. Critical response to Gribbin's writings The conservative political magazine The Spectator described Gribbin as \\"one of the finest and most prolific writers of popular science around\\" in a review of Science: A History, which it praises as \\"the product of immense learning, and a lifetime spent working out how to write in a vivacious way about science and scientists\\". Henry Gee, a senior editor at Nature, described Gribbin as \\"one of the best science writers around\\". A review of The Universe: A Biography in the journal Physics World praised his skill in explaining difficult ideas. A Wall Street Journal review of Flower Hunters (co-authored with Mary Gribbin) described the writing as \\"pedestrian\\", with plenty of domestic detail but a failure to convey a larger cultural context. It stated that the book's chapter-length biographical sketches are too often superficial, and criticised the book for glaring omissions of prominent plant collectors. In a review of The Reason Why, the Times Higher Education states that Gribbin writes on speculative matters and presents some of his theories without supporting evidence, but noted his comprehensive research and lyrical writing.

He made nearly 500 appearances in the Football League, including more than 300 in the First Division with Arsenal, Birmingham City and West Ham United. He was capped by England at under-23 level. He then spent 13 years in management with Orient and Leicester City. Life and career Bloomfield was born in Notting Hill, North Kensington, London. His younger brother Billy was also a professional footballer with Brentford, and a nephew, Ray Bloomfield, featured for Arsenal's youth team and for a brief period for Aston Villa's first team before moving on to play soccer in America. He began his career as a youngster with non-league club Hayes, and had a short spell with Walthamstow Avenue, before joining Second Division club Brentford in October 1952. After Brentford were relegated in 1954, Bloomfield was snapped up by Arsenal for ¬£8,000 as a replacement for Jimmy Logie. Bloomfield made his debut at the start of the season, against Everton on 25 August 1954, though he only played 19 times that season, and it was not until 1955‚Äì56 did he become a first-team regular. A powerful inside forward with a high work rate and accurate passing, Bloomfield was part of Arsenal's attack from 1955 to 1960, one of Arsenal's few stars during a mediocre period for the club. He won caps for England at under-23 level, but never at full level, and for the Football League XI, and also played in the London XI that lost the first Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Barcelona in 1958. Bloomfield played 227 times for Arsenal, scoring 56 goals. However, with the arrival of George Eastham in 1960, Bloomfield lost his place in the team, and was sold to Birmingham City in November that year. Bloomfield spent four seasons with the Blues, reaching and losing another Fairs Cup final in 1961 (this time to Roma). He helped Birmingham win the 1963 League Cup, scoring a goal in the final itself as Birmingham overcame local rivals Aston Villa. In the summer of 1964 he returned to Brentford, and later had spells with West Ham United, Plymouth Argyle and Orient. In 1968, he became Orient's player-manager, and won the Third Division in his second full season, 1969‚Äì70, He was appointed by newly promoted Leicester City in 1971, and kept the Foxes in the First Division for six years. They also reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1973‚Äì74, which they lost, after a replay, to Liverpool. During his six-year stint at Leicester, Bloomfield created a side of free-flowing skilful football on a shoe-string budget, featuring the likes of Frank Worthington, Keith Weller and Len Glover, and he is still considered one of the club's all-time great if not greatest manager. He left the club in 1977, and they were relegated the following season. Bloomfield returned to manage Orient again in 1977, and his second spell in charge included a run to the FA Cup semi-finals in 1977‚Äì78, where they were defeated by his old club Arsenal. He left in 1981 following a dispute with the club chairman, Brian Winston, over the sale of Nigerian international winger John Chiedozie. In a 2014 Football League poll, Bloomfield was voted Orient's best ever manager. After leaving Orient, he was a coach at Luton Town until his sudden death in Chingford, Essex, in 1983, from cancer at the age of 49.

Reiman Gardens (pronounced Rye-Men) is a year-round garden with events, programs, lectures, tours and ISU student classes that has consistently been one of the top visited attractions in Central Iowa. It is open seven days per week; 10:00 am to 4:30 pm, with extended hours in the summer season and extended evening hours for its events. The Gardens are closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day. The Christina Reiman Butterfly Wing Reiman Gardens consists of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly \\"wing\\", butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. ISU students and their classes are admitted free of charge, as are the Gardens' members. An admission fee is charged to the public. Many United Way of Story County agencies directors can receive free passes to distribute to their clients. The Garden Campanile Construction Iowa State University has had a horticulture garden since 1914; Reiman Gardens is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from Bobbi and Roy Reiman. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995. The landscape design was created by Rodney Robinson Landscape Architects. The Mahlstede Horticulture Learning Center was the original building in the Gardens; the original maintenance building was torn down when the new conservatory was built and a new maintenance building was built in an area of the S1 parking lot. The Gardens officially opened its conservatory complex with an open house on November 2, 2002. The new building made the Gardens a year-round facility with an indoor plant conservatory (5,000 square feet), a glass house filled with tropical plants and exotic butterflies (2,500 square feet), an auditorium for classes and events, gift shop, a cafe an events hallway, greenhouses dedicated to the indoor glass house needs, a headhouse, staff offices, and two large areas housing all the heating and cooling and greenhouse systems equipment. In 2007, a construction project removed the cafe and moved the gift shop to the north of the conservatory building. The old gift shop and cafe space was converted into meeting space and became known as The Garden Room. Architects Smith Metzger designed the Christina Reiman Butterfly Wing, the Mahlstede Learning Center, Conservatory Complex and Hunziker Garden House. Annual themes Reiman Gardens uses a process called Dimensional Design to create its annual theme. Using a holistic approach, Dimensional Design requires a team effort from all departments. Thus, the Gardens' staff develops educational programs, interpretation, communications, events and amenities that support one theme, which in turn, also supports the Gardens' mission. The theme encourages guests to view the garden and its mission from a different perspective each time they visit. The theme year planning also gives structure to displays and programs and generates innovative ideas that turn into horticulture displays. Reiman Gardens' Theme Years: * 2003 - Year of the Butterfly * 2004 - Seasons of Agriculture * 2005 - Global Garden (Garden traditions from around the world) * 2006 - Art of Gardening (Gardening as art and art in the garden) * 2007 - Excellence in Bloom (Celebrating Iowa State University's 150th anniversary) * 2008 - The Novel Garden (Gardens inspired by literature) * 2009 - The Landscape Before Time (Plants and insects from pre-historic times) * 2010 - Celebration of the Garden Ornamentation (celebrating quirky garden decorations) * 2011 - Insects!

The current Internet does not extend beyond the electronic realm. Object hyperlinking aims to extend the Internet to the physical world by attaching tags with URLs to tangible objects or locations. These object tags can then be read by a wireless mobile device and information about objects and locations retrieved and displayed. However, object hyperlinking may also be sensible for contexts other than the Internet (e.g. with data objects in data base administering or with text content management).  System components  Components of an object hyperlinking scheme Linking an object or a location to the Internet is a more involved process than linking two web pages. An object hyperlinking system requires seven components: #A virtual or physical object tag to identify objects and locations. Some tagging systems are described below. To allow the object tags to be located they must be physically embedded in visual markers. For example, the Yellow arrow scheme [see below] prints SMS tags on large adhesive yellow arrows, which can then be stuck on buildings etc. #A means of reading physical tags, or locating virtual tags. #A mobile device such as a mobile telephone, a PDA or a portable computer. #Additional software for the mobile device. #A commonly open wireless network, such as the existing 2G and 3G networks, for communication between the portable device and the server containing the information linked to the tagged object. #Information on each linked object. This information could be in existing WWW pages, existing databases of price information etc., or have been specially created. #A display to view the information on the linked object. At the present time this is most likely to be the screen of a mobile telephone.  Tags and tag-reading systems  There are a number of different competing tagging systems. ;RFID tags :A radio frequency identification device (also known as an 'Arphid') is a small transponder which can be read at short range by a transceiver (reader). Since RFID tags can be very small, they are often embedded in a more visible marker to allow them to be located. :A RFID reader can be added to an existing mobile telephone as a shell. Nokia produce such a shell for their 3220 mobile phone. More and more mobile phones have RFID/NFC capability, since such RFID/NFC enabled mobiles may be used for cashless payments and other purposes. :Since 2005 travelers in the city of Hanau, near Frankfurt, Germany have been able to pay for bus tickets by passing their Nokia phones over a smartcard reader installed on the buses. Other applications for RFID enabled mobiles include swapping electronic business cards between phones, and using a mobile to check in at an airport or hotel. Two RFID enabled devices may also be used to enable peer-to-peer transfer of data such as music, images or for synchronizing address books. QR Code for \\"An Internet of Things\\" \\" ;Graphical tags :A graphical tag consists of an image on a marker, which can be read by a mobile telephone camera. There are a number of competing systems, including open standards like Quick Response QR Codes, Datamatrix, Semacodes (based on Datamatrix), and barcodes; or proprietary systems like ShotCodes. The design of such coding schemes needs to be rich enough to include much information and robust enough for the tag to be readable, even when partly obscured or damaged: tags might be on the outside of buildings and exposed to wear and the weather. :Graphical tags have a number of advantages. They are easy to understand and cheap to produce. They can also be printed on almost anything, including t-shirts. Barcodes are a particularly attractive form of tagging because they are already very widely used, and camera phones can easily read them. ;SMS tags :An SMS tag comprises a short alphanumerical code, which can be printed on a marker or chalked on a wall. The Short Message Service is then used to send the code and return a message. Yellow arrows are an example of this form of tagging. ;Virtual tags :In a virtual tagging system there is no physical tag at a location. Instead a URL as a meta-object is associated with a set of geographical coordinates. Using location-based services a mobile phone that enters a particular area can be used to retrieve all URLs associated with that area. The area can be set as a few metres or a much wider area. ;Hardlink :A hardlink is an alphanumeric combination such as an object's common name or part number that when entered into a cell phone's web browser, targeting a hardlink database, returns information that may have been stored about the target object.  Applications  The object hyperlinking systems described above will make it possible to link comprehensive and editable information to any object or location. How this capability can best be used remains to be seen. What has emerged so far is a mixture of social and commercial applications. *The publishers of the Lonely Planet guidebooks are issuing yellow arrows with one of their guidebooks and encouraging travellers to leave tags to stories and comments wherever they go. *Siemens see their virtual tagging system being used to tag tourist sites, and also leave messages for friends. They also suggest that virtual tags could be used to link advertisements with locations. *Nokia have demonstrated that when a 3220 phone with the RFID shell attached is tapped against an RFID-enabled advertisement, a URL can be read and information about the advertised product or service returned to the phone. *Japanese consumers are able to read barcodes with their mobiles and download comparative prices from Amazon. Using Semapedia to link from a tag to a Wikipedia article *Semapedia have created a system for linking physical objects and Wikipedia articles using the Semacode tagging scheme. Graphical tags can be created that link to the URLs of individual Wikipedia articles. These tags can then be attached to the physical objects mentioned in the Wikipedia articles. Reading a tag with a camera phone will then retrieve an article from Wikipedia and display it on the phone screen, creating a \\"Mobile Wikipedia\\". *An alternative to using 2d barcodes is to apply computer vision techniques to identify more complex patterns and images. Companies like kooaba, Daem, or Neven Vision (acquired by Google in 2006) develop image recognition platforms to turn any image into object hyperlinks. *Microsoft has developed a system for creating hyperlinks using image matching. *Google is now planning to tag 100,000 businesses in the United States with QR codes.

It rises in Meadow Lake in Northwood, and flows south, then generally east through Raymond, Epping, Lee, Durham and finally Newmarket. Here, it meets Great Bay, a tidal inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, to which it is connected by a tidal estuary, the Piscataqua River. The river from the Bunker Pond Dam in Epping to the confluence with the Piscassic River is part of the designated National Wild and Scenic River System. Wildlife The shoreline of the Lamprey River, its floodplain and its wetlands provide a wide range of valuable wildlife habitats. Its anadromous fishery is one of the strongest in the Great Bay watershed. Anadromous fish species that use the Lamprey River include shad, river herring, smelt and even Atlantic salmon. These fish are hatched in the river, then spend most of their lives out at sea, returning to the river to spawn. The fish species will move up the river as far as Durham, where they are prevented from moving further upstream by Wiswall Dam. The river is also rich in species of freshwater mussels. The river is managed by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department for several different types of game fish, including brook trout which is native to the river. Rainbow trout and brown trout are also stocked in many parts of the river but are not native to the area. Lampreys are also present in the river. However, the Lamprey River derives its name from an early settler, John Lamprey, who lived in the area, rather than the fish itself. History Segments of the river are rich in history. Saw- and gristmills which operated by water power were common along the river. The Wiswall Falls Mills Site in Durham is on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally a sawmill, the site was used subsequently to make knives, nuts and bolts, pitchforks, carriages, matches and wallpaper. Sites such as Wadleigh Falls show the remnants of old mills and the rich river culture that used to be. Wadleigh Falls, located in Lee, is the remains of a dam created to power a mill which fed a mill pond at one point. Setting Along the banks are hardwood forests and numerous farms. The area is under pressure from suburban development as one of the fastest-growing areas in New England. There is a strong local culture surrounding the Lamprey River with several local events held on the river, including numerous town-run fishing derbies and the Lamprey River Canoe Race held annually in Epping. During the course of its journey from the Saddleback Mountains in Northwood down to Newmarket, the Lamprey changes from a small torrential stream to a large tidal river. The river between these points has slow meanders and rapids, and small waterfalls such as Packers Falls in Durham.

It broadcasts in the regions of Koper,OTG TV Se≈æana and Nova Gorica. Sponka.tv was born as a Cable TV channel, and has only been broadcasting on terrestrial TV since 2003. Programmes The station broadcasts mostly local news, local sports, and music, as well as advertisement and pornographic films at late night. It claims to be the voice of the culture and the people of the Slovenian Littoral. =Programme Controversy= The programming is not without controversy. For example, the pornographic films are broadcast too early, starting at 22:00, even though Slovenian law prohibits their broadcast at that kind of time. In addition, the music broadcast by the station is mostly Balkan (Serbian turbofolk) which has nothing to do with the Slovenian Littoral. Frequency Controversy The station is controversial,Tabla pogovorov :: Splo≈°no :: Re: Zakaj ne vidim Italia 1 La voce del popolo TV e frontiera, un caso triestino because it transmits, from the local repeater of Tinjan, near the town of Koper, on the Slovenian Littoral, on the channel UHF 52. However, in the same area, on the same channel, transmits, from the repeater of Conconello in Trieste (but also receivable on the same frequency from the repeaters of Monte Madonna (Teolo) in Padova, Prati della Chiesa (Pedrosa) Udine, and Monte San Michele (Sagrado) in Gorizia),OTG TV the Italian private channel Italia Uno, which is the most watched channel by the youths of both Italy, and the Slovenian Littoral. =Beginning= The controversy began in late 2003 when Sponka.TV got the license to broadcast on UHF 52 from Tinjan. According to known sources, this was done because the European Commission told Slovenia to turn on anything at all on that channel in order to reclaim it. The wills of the people in the transmitter's target area were not considered at all. At the first the channel's signal was relatively week but its strength kept increasing. The first complaints also appeared in social media around then. In addition, the station's director, Neda Ger≈æelj, engaged in defamatory practices against the Italian Republic on the same social media. Already then, however, the raison d'etre of the station's terrestrial frequency was called into question by the local population because according to contemporary Slovenian law, a cable-only station was not allowed to start terrestrial transmissions, putting into question the validity of the station's license. =Frequency war= In addition, Italia Uno was then the most watched channel in the Slovenian littoral and might therefore have been deemed unwanted competition. Other big commercial Italian channels were also targets of the so-called Frequency war, for example most frequencies of Canale 5, Italia Uno's sister channel, were covered too, as were those of the second sister channel, Rete 4. La7 (formerly Telemontecarlo) and MTV Italia (formerly Videomusic) were also subject to interferences, however so were also the Slovenian POP TV and Kanal A, subject to interferences from the Italian side (though the Italians were the first to broadcast on those frequencies). There was also a mysterious fire at the Conconello transmitter around the same time, which damaged the transmission equipment of Telefriuli, causing it to reduce the strength of its signal, limiting its availability on Slovenian territory. The causes for that fire have to this day not been established, and the possibility it was a Slovenian terrorist attack against the transmitter exists. =Temporary stop= In around 2005, the situation came to a temporary stop, as the signal of Sponka.TV on UHF 52 disappeared, leaving Italia Uno visible with a clear picture again. The complaints subsided and the situation returned to normal. Sponka.TV resumed its broadcasts on Cable TV. The reasons for that are to this day unknown, and most people at the time thought the channel simply gave up and desisted. However, that would soon prove false. =Resumption= The crisis resumed when Sponka.TV's signal returned and Italia Uno disappeared again. Complaints from the local population flared up again but were again ignored. Eventually, the signal's strength was increased again. Soon, the channel also turned on a second frequency, UHF 30 from Ankaran-Hrvatini, making it impossible to receive La7 (formerly Telemontecarlo) in some places. And, just like UHF 52, the signal on UHF 30 also interfered on Italian territory. In addition, the channel's broadcasts were also detected on UHF 34 in Divaƒça, possibly from Se≈æana, without any license, whatsoever, and it eventually also obtained frequencies on a transmitter north of Nova Gorica, again without license. =Apparent end= Since December 2010, the controversy has become moot as Italy and Slovenia have both switched off the analog signals, and the digital multiplex inside which Italia Uno is located is on channel UHF 49 (between 2010 and 2012 on UHF 36), and was never on Sponka.TV's UHF 34. However, for a while, UHF 52 and UHF 30 both kept transmitting in analog even after the switch off for unknown reasons, interfering with a Mediaset pay TV multiplex on UHF 52 and a RAI state TV multiplex on UHF 30. Also, Sponka.TV started an expansion without license, as it became hosted in ViTel TV's multiplex in Nova Gorica, on UHF 34 (same frequency Sponka.TV's own multiplex broadcasts on from Ankaran- Hrvatini). This and the station's previous actions make it possible that it was all along interested in nothing but aggressive expansionism in the aether. In December 2011 Sponka.tv has also begun transmitting via DTT on channel UHF 34 (Multiplex L5) from the transmitter of Ankaran.APEK =Reasons for the controversy= Due to Sponka.tv's signal interfering with that of Italia Uno, at some locations to the point of Sponka.tv completely replacing Italia Uno, several requests have been forwarded to the direction of Sponka.tv, requesting them to cease, and desist, their transmissions from Tinjan, or at least, to move them onto some other frequency. Sponka.tv's direction, however, dis- missed the requests completely. The controversy is important, because Sponka.tv doesn't interfere with Italia Uno only on the Slovenian territory, but also on the Italian territory, hence, why the owners of Italia Uno, Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset, themselves, also requested Sponka.tv to do something about the issue already, yet, Sponka.tv still refuses to comply with the given requests, giving the 1961 agreement between Italy, and Yugoslavia, in which, the channel UHF 52 was assigned to Yugoslavia, as their reason not to do so. However, Yugoslavia, and later, Slovenian, never used the channel until the advent of Sponka.tv in 2003, hence, why Mediaset used the channel for Italia Uno. The channel has also been assigned to Italy for after 2012, for use in DTT broadcasting. Another reason for the controversy is that the program is from Portoro≈æ, yet its intended area of terrestrial coverage only includes the town of Koper and its surroundings, while Portoro≈æ is not even considered.

Serving as a major output pathway of the amygdala, the stria terminalis runs from its centromedial division to the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Anatomy The stria terminalis covers the superior thalamostriate vein, marking a line of separation between the thalamus and the caudate nucleus as seen upon gross dissection of the ventricles of the brain, viewed from the superior aspect. The stria terminalis extends from the region of the interventricular foramina to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, carrying fibers from the amygdala to the septal nuclei, hypothalamic, and thalamic areas of the brain. It also carries fibers projecting from these areas back to the amygdala. Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) The activity of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis correlates with anxiety in response to threat monitoring. It is thought to act as a relay site within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and regulate its activity in response to acute stress. However, the stress response is time related and the BNST does not activate for contextual fear. This means that a sudden scary situation that is under ten minutes long, does not activate the BNST. It is also thought to promote behavioral inhibition in response to unfamiliar individuals, by input from the orbitofrontal cortex. Bilateral disruption of this pathway has been shown to attenuate reinstatement of drug seeking behaviour in rodents. This nucleus is known to project inhibitory fibers to the lateral hypothalamus and participate in the control of feeding in rodents. Optogenetic activation of this inhibitory pathway rapidly produced voracious feeding behavior in well-fed mice and optogenetic inhibition of this pathway reduces food intake even in starved animals. Sexual dimorphism The central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) is sexually dimorphic. On average, the BSTc is twice as large in men as in women and contains twice the number of somatostatin neurons. A sample of six post- mortem, long-term HRT treated trans women (male-to-female) were found to have a female-typical number of cells in the BSTc, whereas a trans man (female-to- male) was found to have a male-typical number. The authors (Jiang-Ning Zhou, Frank PM Kruijver, Dick Swaab) also examined subjects with hormone-related disorders and found no pattern between those disorders and the BSTc while the single untreated male-to-female transsexual had a female-typical number of cells. They concluded that the BSTc provides evidence for a neurobiological basis of gender identity and proposed that such was determined before birth. Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to influence hypothalamic size, even though the study tried to do this by including non-transsexual male and female controls which, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The statement about the neurobiological basis from birth has later been brought to question, though not refuted, by a follow up study by the same group which found that the sexual dimorphism of the BSTc is not present before adulthood (approximately 22 years of age) even though transsexuals report being aware of their gender identity since childhood. Since somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron, thus inhibiting signals traveling through associated structures, it is believed that the larger bed nucleus of the stria terminalis found in men (including transgender men) reduce the startle response in men and may be responsible for the higher incidence of specific phobias in women, and a possible source for the stereotype of women being afraid of mice. Oxytocin receptor activity in the BNST is important for social recognition in rats. Both male and female rats that received a microinjection of oxytocin receptor antagonist had lower social recognition scores than rats that received a vehicle injection, and microinjections of oxytocin into the BNST enhanced social memory in male, but not female, rats. Reduction of the size of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis has been observed in pedophilic male perpetrators, in addition to reductions in the right amygdala, hypothalamus and abnormalities in related structures. The authors propose that childhood deficits in the BNST and medial amygdala may cause inhibition of sexual maturity.

The company pioneered a risk management approach to cryptographic services. It had offices in New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts. It offered three main public key infrastructure (PKI) based products: an Identity Warranty system (tracking and insuring reliance on identity assertions in financial transactions); an electronic payment system (internally known as Acquire); and an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder for validating X.509 public key certificates. It went out of business in Spring 2002 never having found a wide market for its products despite filing a number of patents and developing new technology. History =Early history= CertCo was founded in March 1994 by Frank Sudia] and Peter Freund as an internal bank department known as BT Electronic Commerce (BTEC). It spun out in November 1996 as CertCo with a number of outside strategic and financial investors in a transaction managed by Goldman Sachs. Some of its better known early employees included Rich Ankney, Ed Appel, Alan Asay, Ernest Brickell, David Kravitz (inventor of the Digital Signature Algorithm), Yair Frankel, Dan Geer, C.T. Montgomery, Jay Simmons, Nanette Di Tosto, Paul Turner, Mark Jefferson and Moti Yung. Early on it licensed the \\"Fair Cryptosystem\\" key escrow patents of MIT Professor Silvio Micali and announced plans to implement a \\"Commercial Key Escrow System\\". Thereafter the policy climate for key escrow turned negative, market interest waned, and the system was never built. =Vision= CertCo and Bankers Trust promoted the creation of a bank consortium to serve as a PKI certificate authority for global commerce, leading to the 1999 launch of Identrus, later renamed Identrust. The banks, however, declined to license CertCo's technology, opting instead for a vendor- neutral approach. Unlike the vendor-neutral approach, Certco promoted a risk management approach to PKI with transaction level insurance, and pioneered novel visionary approach to authentication in the financial sector: First, a distributed proactively secured certificate authority was designed and built (had it become a standard, it would have avoided a single control point over certificate authorities, and would have avoided coercion by that control point, and would have been further used to prevent attacks on the trust infrastructure, like the one on DigiNotar). Secondly, strong authentication of clients employing PKI and digital signatures was promoted, and if it had been widely used this would have reduced the effect of Phishing attacks, also envisioned as a possible threat to financial transactions).http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/regional/ro19983q/sf/infocus3.html The Payment System: Emerging Issues (FDIC) CertCo's most notable commercial customer was SETCo, the operating company for the Visa-MasterCard Secure electronic transaction credit card security protocol, to which it provided certificate authority technology, which was the first implementation of distributed Threshold cryptography based signing. =Business failure= CertCo used up all of its money, never found a wide market for its products, and went out of business in Spring 2002, following substantial reductions in technical staff in November and December 2001, due, partially, to unavailability of investors after the September 11 attacks. Technical contributions CertCo made various contributions to the fields of cryptography and public key infrastructure via scientific publications and patents.

It was intended to counter the perceived capabilities of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 and proposed to arm both the F-15 Eagle and F-4 Phantom, the missile ultimately never entered service. Overview In the early to mid-1970s the United States was highly concerned by the perceived capabilities of the MiG-25, an aircraft which was known to be capable of speeds in excess of Mach 3 and which carried long-range air-to-air missiles. It was widely claimed that the Foxbat was a new generation \\"super- fighter\\", capable of comfortably outclassing any US or allied aircraft. The US initiated the F-15 Eagle program largely in response to this threat. To equip the F-15 the Air Force initiated development of the AIM-82 short-range missile and the AIM-97 Seekbat. The former was a dogfighting missile intended as a replacement for the AIM-9 Sidewinder, the latter was to be a new high-altitude long-range missile designed specifically to shoot down the MiG-25 - hence the name Seekbat, the bat referring to the MiG-25's \\"Foxbat\\" NATO reporting name. The Seekbat was based on the AGM-78 Standard ARM. It had a larger propulsion unit and used semi-active radar homing with an infrared seeker for terminal guidance of the missile. The operational ceiling was . Test firings began in late 1972, but the Seekbat program did not make a great deal of progress and was cancelled in 1976. By this time new knowledge of the MiG-25s capabilities and role led to the cancellation of the program because the missile's cost did not justify its procurement.

He was a famous sportsman in the hunting-field. Origins Fortescue was the son of Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue (1818‚Äì1905), whose main seat was Castle Hill, Filleigh, Devon, by his wife Georgiana Augusta Charlotte Caroline Dawson-Damer, daughter of George Lionel Dawson-Damer.

Career =Education= He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was treasurer of the University Pitt Club. =Local career in Devon= He was a captain in the North Devon Hussar Yeoman Cavalry and became Colonel of the North Devon Yeomanry. He was a J.P. for Devon and for South Molton, the town close to the family seat of Castle Hill, Filleigh. He served as Deputy Lieutenant for Devon and was Lord-Lieutenant of Devon from 1903 to 1928.

He graduated in Philosophy from the University of Lisbon in 1977, and has been teaching it in high school since 1975. His experiences in education eventually led him to write a semi-autobiographical satire titled \\"The Test\\" in 2000. Fiction Barreiros's writing style, influenced by that of Robert Silverberg and James Tiptree, Jr, is distinctively sardonic and shows a marked tendency towards satire and black comedy. His plots frequently employ unlikeable protagonists in dystopic settings, where they are faced with the brutality of everyday life and are often thwarted by their own actions in the end. The stories tend to offer extremely graphic depictions of violence, and utterly reject political correctness and its icons -- Walt Disney and Sesame Street are frequent targets of derision by Barreiros, for example, and he has gone so far as to cast Big Bird analogues as the principal antagonists in A verdadeira invas√£o dos marcianos. Some of Barreiros's work has been translated into English, Spanish, French, Italian and Serbian. He has twice won the Brazilian Nova Award, offered by fans to the best foreign short story published in South America, for \\"Um Dia com J√∫lia na Necrosfera\\" (in 1992) and \\"A Arder Ca√≠ram os Anjos\\" (in 1994).Silva, Cesar.

The mercilessness of Barreiros's criticism earned him a reputation among Portuguese science fiction fans, and his titanium nib fountain pen gained legendary status as a result. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Barreiros edited two science fiction and fantasy labels for Editora Cl√°ssica and Gradiva. Among the writers he introduced to a Portuguese audience are Iain M. Banks, William Gibson, Peter Straub, Dan Simmons and A. A. Attanasio. Publishers usually balked at Barreiros's unorthodox picks, and so books like Stephen R. Donaldson's Lord Foul's Bane, Nancy A. Collins's Sunglasses After Dark and James Blaylock's The Last Coin were translated but never published. Barreiros also co-founded Simetria -- Portuguese Science Fiction and Fantasy Association in 1995 (he later broke from it, in 1999), and the Portuguese Association for the Fantastic in the Arts in 2005.

It is especially effective against species of Pseudomonas. It was patented in 1965 and approved for medical use in 1974. Medical uses Like all aminoglycosides, tobramycin does not pass the gastro-intestinal tract, so for systemic use it can only be given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Ophthalmic (tobramycin only, Tobrex, or combined with dexamethasone, sold as Tobradex) and nebulised formulations both have low systemic absorption. The formulation for injection is branded Nebcin. The nebulised formulation (brand name Tobi) is indicated in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Tobrex is a 0.3% tobramycin sterile ophthalmic solution is produced by Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals. Benzalkonium chloride 0.01% is added as a preservative. It is available by prescription only in Bulgaria, the United States and Canada. In certain countries, it is available over the counter. Tobrex and Tobradex are indicated in the treatment of superficial infections of the eye, such as bacterial conjunctivitis. Tobramycin (injection) is also indicated for various severe or life-threatening infections caused by susceptible strains: sepsis, meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, bone infections, and skin structure infections, complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections. =Spectrum of susceptibility= Tobramycin has a narrow spectrum of activity and is active against Gram- positive Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria. Clinically, tobramycin is frequently used to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: * Pseudomonas aeruginosa - <0.25 ¬µg/mL - 92 ¬µg/mL [ref?] * Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) - 0.5 ¬µg/mL - >512 ¬µg/mL [ref?] * Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) - 0.5 ¬µg/mL - 2 ¬µg/mL The MIC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, KP-1, is 2.3¬±0.2 ¬µg/mL at 25 ¬∞C [unpublished]. Side effects Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is ototoxic: it can cause hearing loss, or a loss of equilibrioception, or both in genetically susceptible individuals. These individuals carry a normally harmless genetic mutation that allows aminoglycosides such as tobramycin to affect cochlear cells. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is generally irreversible. As with all aminoglycosides, tobramycin is also nephrotoxic, it can damage or destroy the tissue of the kidneys. This effect can be particularly worrisome when multiple doses accumulate over the course of a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing tubular reabsorption during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons parenteral tobramycin needs to be carefully dosed by body weight, and its serum concentration monitored. Tobramycin is thus said to be a drug with a narrow therapeutic index. Mechanism of action Tobramycin works by binding to a site on the bacterial 30S and 50S ribosome, preventing formation of the 70S complex. As a result, mRNA cannot be translated into protein, and cell death ensues. Tobramycin also binds to RNA- aptamers, artificially created molecules to bind to certain targets. However, there seems to be no indication that Tobramycin binds to natural RNAs or other nucleic acids. The effect of tobramycin can be inhibited by metabolites of the Krebs (TCA) cycle, such as glyoxylate. These metabolites protect against tobramycin lethality by diverting carbon flux away from the TCA cycle, collapsing cellular respiration, and thereby inhibiting Tobramycin uptake and thus lethality.

The incision is typically made with a scalpel and extended with surgical scissors.

It lies in the civil parish of Martinhoe at the edge of the Exmoor National Park and is a waypoint on the South West Coast Path. There were once plans to develop the area to become a holiday resort. Access to the remote beach is via a very narrow one mile long steep lane, there is no parking. Around the headland is Lee Abbey Bay that is on the Lee Abbey Estate. This has an accessible beach with parking. History In 1885 the Manor of Martinhoe, including the then-named Wooda Bay, was purchased by Colonel Benjamin Lake, a wealthy solicitor from Orpington in Kent. Perhaps in an effort to emulate Sir George Newnes' efforts in the nearby twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth, Col. Lake planned to develop the bay as an exclusive resort. He converted Martinhoe Manor House into an Hotel, and in 1894, opened a new golf course at Martinhoe common. Plots of land were sold off, and a number of villas were built on the wooded slopes overlooking the bay. Col. Lake's plans meant there would be a need to bring in more visitors, by improving communications into the area. New roads were built and in 1895, construction of a pier was started, to provide access from coastal steamers. In 1898, The narrow-gauge Lynton & Barnstaple Railway arrived, with a relatively substantial station built high above the bay. There were also plans (never fulfilled) for a branch line to run down towards the shore. In January 1897, with the pier almost completed, a major steamship company operating in the area announced that they would be sailing to Woody Bay instead of Lynmouth. This caused considerable alarm among the Lynton and Lynmouth residents, and eventually, the decision was reversed. The official opening of the Woody Bay pier took place on 15 April 1897. However, bad weather and low tides prevented the first ships from docking, and this set the scene for future visitors ‚Äì the pier was not long enough to cater for landings at low tide. Although there was a regular service from Bristol, fewer steamers were calling than had been intended, and plans were drawn up to extend the pier further out into the bay. A cliff railway was also mooted, like the nearby Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway, to connect with the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway, although neither plan ever came to fruition. On 12 January 1899, the pier was severely damaged by a storm, with another a year later. It was never repaired, and the remains were finally demolished for scrap in 1902, although some evidence of its existence can still be seen on the shoreline today. The Colonel continued pouring money into the area, in an effort to see his dream become reality. In July 1900, he was forced into bankruptcy, with debts of over ¬£170,000. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison, for using clients' savings to fund the Woody Bay developments, and died in 1907 along with any prospect of further intensive developments around Martinhoe.  Present day  Woody Bay railway station is the base of the modern Lynton and Barnstaple Railway, a charitable trust which has re-opened some of the original route for steam trains.

A corduroy road or log road is a type of road or timber trackway made by placing logs, perpendicular to the direction of the road over a low or swampy area. The result is an improvement over impassable mud or dirt roads, yet rough in the best of conditions and a hazard to horses due to shifting loose logs. Corduroy roads can also be built as a foundation for other surfacing. If the logs are buried in wet, acidic, anaerobic soils such as peat or muskeg, they decay very slowly. A few corduroy road foundations that date back to the early 20th century still exist in North America. One example is the Alaska Highway between Burwash Landing and Koidern, Yukon, Canada, which was rebuilt in 1943, less than a year after the original route was graded on thin soil and vegetation over permafrost, by using corduroy, then building gravel road on top. During the 1980s, the gravel was covered with a chip-seal. The late 1990s saw replacement of this road with modern road construction, including rerouting of the entire highway. In World War II they were used by both German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front.Military Improvisations During the Russian Campaign, Chap 5, Center of Military History, US Army In slang use, corduroy road can also refer to a road in ill repair, having many potholes, ruts, or surface swellings.

Initiated by Sant Kirpal Singh in 1965, he began work as a Satguru himself in 1976, following the death of Kirpal Singh. Thakar Singh distributed what he paraphrased from Kirpal Singh as, \\"a practical form of spirituality which is not connected to any particular religion, sect, or thought.\\" While he was born into Sikhism, and wore the traditional Sikh garb all his life, he gave up its traditional outer practices soon after initiation and devoted himself wholly to the Sant Mat spiritual practices known as Surat Shabd Yoga and Naam. Continuing Kirpal Singh's emphasis on the unity of all religions, Thakar Singh frequently referred to the Bible when addressing Westerners, the Adi Granth, Ramayana and other Indian scriptures in India, and the Qur'an when addressing Muslim people. He gave thousands of talks in his 30 years as a Master, his message being one of transcendence of the material and devotion to God, the \\"unchangeable permanence behind all things\\". Biography The documentation on Sant Thakar Singh's life is mainly limited to the few details he communicated about himself during his talks and public appearances. A biography composed of stories about the Master was collected by Wendy Heid in 1994, and it touches the central points from the perspective of the inner, spiritual aspirations. It has few points of contact with concrete people, places, or times. Sant Thakar Singh corrected and edited this work, however, and it was subsequently reprinted in 2000 and again in 2005, so the facts presented are probably authentic. There are also some biographical materials made available by his organisation Know Thyself As Soul, International, although they have few details or specifics and again focus in the main on the inner life. =Period of discipleship= Thakar's daily routine during his period of discipleship is described in a talk he gave at the Bhandara (death anniversary) of Sant Kirpal Singh on 21 August 2003: =Devotional work = Thakar began to work in the capacity of a preacher, and to hold Satsang (spiritual gatherings) in his home and elsewhere. This was a logical continuation of the devotional music classes and study classes of the Adi Granth he had been giving privately for many years; the only difference was that instead of preaching against the physical master, he now explained the Guru Granth Sahib in the light of his inner experiences. Sant Kirpal Singh visited Thakar's city by invitation and visited his home in this time frame (exact date and location in the Punjab unknown, but near to Amritsar): Each Sunday on his day off, Thakar would travel from one town to another to give satsang. Sometimes he would visit as many as four towns in one day. He also increased his meditation time on work days to four, five, and then six hours. In 1970, Sant Kirpal Singh issued an invitation to all of his initiates in the form of a circular letter inviting anyone who wanted to have special instruction on how to give satsang to come to Delhi and receive personal lessons. Thakar applied for a four-month leave of absence from his work and began this intensive meditation retreat in the presence of the master with four other aspirants. The retreat consisted of 12 to 14 hours of meditation daily as the main regimen. Thakar returned to work after four months and continued his practices. When Sant Kirpal Singh died in 1974, Thakar applied for a long leave of absence and went into intensive meditation for up to 16 hours a day for an extended period. Afterwards he did not return to work but kept extending his leave, taking unpaid leave or making other arrangements until he retired early, at the age of 47. =Guruship= Sant Kirpal Singh did not publicly name a successor, and after his death in 1974, a number of proposed successors appeared including Sant Darshan Singh (Sant Kirpal Singh's physical son), Sant Ajaib Singh, Soami Divyanand, and others. Sant Thakar Singh began work in the role of Guru at Sawan Asham in Delhi on 7 February 1976. Within four months he travelled to Germany and then later that year to Mexico. In 1979 he visited the United States for the first time. His first American representative was named Bernadine Chard. In 1987 he visited Canada. Sant Thakar Singh's mission grew steadily over time and he was responsible for a number of innovations and records. He was the first Sant Mat Master to visit Africa, making a five-month tour through the continent and visiting twelve countries, from October to February 1989. He also visited the Far East for the first time that year, going to South Korea, The Philippine Islands, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Taiwan during a three-month tour. He visited New Zealand on the same tour. Eventually he would reach all the continents with the exception of Antarctica and as many as forty countries. He moved his national headquarters to Nawan Nagar, near the foothills of Himalayas. In April 1992, Sant Thakar Singh went into seclusion about 25 kilometres away in Sai. He did not travel for some years except for brief visits, maintaining an intensive meditation schedule and very simple lifestyle. This regime continued for the rest of the Master's life. He visited the United States for the last time in the summer of 2003. At the end of his life he spoke of having initiated over two million souls. =Illness and death= Sant Thakar Singh died on 6 March 2005 in Nawan Nagar, India, at the age of 76; however, he had been ill for the entire previous year when he underwent open heart surgery in February 2004. =Successor= Sant Thakar Singh took the unusual step in unusual circumstances, before his health conditions worsened, of naming Sant Baljit Singh as his successor while he was still alive. Sant Baljit Singh is also trying to do the same thing by Giving Naamdaan To the people of this world and Telling them that we All Need To Go back To our Father. Sant Baljit Singhs official web page: http://www.santmat.net/ Teachings The documentation of the teachings of Sant Thakar Singh is both extensive and multi-media in character, including books, circular letters, video, and audio tapes spanning almost 30 years. =Basic proposition of spirituality: we are souls, not bodies= Our chief enemy in this pursuit is our own mind, which does not allow our Soul to be in control, but instead usurps control over us: One of the Master's most well known analogies for the control of the mind over the soul is that of the frog in the dirty drain: =Requirement of personal experience in spiritual matters= The Master often emphasised the essential requirement of personal experience in all things spiritual; not depending on others but finding reality for oneself: Again, Similarly, the main function of the experiences given to the disciple at the time of initiation is to convince the disciple there is something worth seeking inside‚Äîi.e., that the Master's instructions are worth pursuing. If something is provided initially, without any effort at all on the part of the disciple, a free sample as it were‚Äîthen more will surely be available in the future with some efforts on the part of the meditator. =Soul is the prisoner of mind and matter= God is an essence and is subtle, matter is the opposite or negation of God. Mind is subtle matter, so both mind and matter are our enemies as soul. The purpose of life is to reunite with God, with whom we have been separated. Life is suffering due to this separation. =Purpose of human life= The human form has been especially created to serve this purpose as a vehicle for reuniting with the Lord; and it has no other function. It was earned by us after long lifespans in other forms. When a person suffers sickness or discomfort, those are reminders of our mortality. They are given only because we are not on the Way. To find God, first we must acquire knowledge of who and what we are as soul, and then we will be able to find something greater. We are not bodies, but souls, and soul is of the same essence as God, i.e., soul is God, but on a smaller scale. The soul is entombed in layers of coverings, the chief of which are the body, mind, and intellect. These coverings are not alive; the soul is alive and provides the motive energy which is used to drive the coverings. We are so identified with these coverings, that we no longer have any idea we are souls and instead identify completely with the body and mind. God has not provided anything useless, and human beings are functionally complete as regards their given purpose, they need nothing extra such as worldly education or money: The Master extends this even to food and drink, and tells stories sometimes of people who have subsisted on the inner food alone. He sometimes quotes Jesus who said, \\"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word which comes forth from the mouth of God.\\" According to the Master this reference has an esoteric meaning, and the Word which Jesus speaks of is the inner Sound Current. =Karma and the revolving powers= Regarding the other species of life, the Master follows the view expressed in Hinduism, namely that we are souls passing through a continuous process of phenomenological evolution, moving from one form to the next more complex form, gaining more and more complex consciousness and also more complex desires‚Äîuntil the soul is lucky enough to find itself incarnated as a human being. This state of consciousness such as experienced by a human being is the top most rung of a ladder which continues upwards; a qualitative change is required to go higher. However, the soul can also fall lower if the attention is directed to lower things, such as pets, carnal desires, or drug use. Generally it must suffer hells for missing this crucial chance. =Nature of suffering= Regarding suffering, the Master totally rejects the premise of life as requiring misery: Life in this world is suffering; however, suffering is totally foreign to our natures and life is something we were meant only to live and enjoy. That enjoyment is not here, however, but with God: Anyone who thinks this life can be made into something enjoyable is deluded. Mankind grasps at the momentary pleasures only because he knows of nothing better. He enjoys sexuality and then the result‚Äîa child and all the attendant problems and worries‚Äîarrives. All the enjoyments of this world are traps like this, which seem sweet on the outset but turn out to be tragic. Regarding renunciation, it is not possible as a practical matter to live without action or live without desire. However, action can be transcended by devoting oneself entirely to a being who has himself become One and living by his instructions. Through the love of God in the form of a person who has become One with Him, we too can be One with Him. This person is the Guru. The Guru is the way out of suffering; he is like a lifeline leading to safety. =Functional role of the living master= God is not a silent spectator, watching the world impassively; He is fully conscious of the tormented situation in which his souls (which are really his own self) are suffering. However, God does not directly intervene in the universe but makes use of agencies. If there is to be rain, it does not fall from a clear sky. First the clouds gather, then the rain comes out from them. If a child is to be born, the mother and father are provided. In the same way, everything in this world works through the function of some agency above and all the higher powers operate in this way, even God. God is One, but has deputed control over vast regions of the universe (both physical and spiritual) to agencies which handle the management. The situation is analogous to a King, who has both a prime minister and many generals managing various aspects of his kingdom. No one approaches the King directly, but all interact with him via his functionaries. In this way he continues to enjoy the total purity, bliss, and ecstasy which is his nature; while the world goes forward in myriad forms. Thus if God is to interact with mankind, He has to come in the form of a man. There is no other means available for him to interact directly with us, as the functionaries are controlling the entire region we inhabit. The Saints and Masters (spiritual teachers) have been coming since human beings first came into existence. They have come in our own time; and they will continue to come as long as there are people who need to be awakened. =Key concept of the Sound Current: Shabd, Naam, or Word= Shabd, Naam, or Word is a form of God or a manifestation of God which human beings can experience, and contact with it has medicinal and practical benefits. The Word is not to be confused with the written words in the scriptures; the scriptures refer to the Word, but reading them does not comprise the experience of hearing it. To hear the Sound Current, some specific actions have to be taken on the part of the Master. Functionally, the Soul is buried under the karmic impressions of millions if not billions of years of existence in this world. The Master Saint has the power to burn these impressions so that they are neutralised; after this, the Soul can experience the Sound Current. The appearance of the Sound is a function of purity; the more pure the vessel, the more easily the sound resounds inside it. Thus the Sound Current is a gift which the Master can give to those whom he chooses, or perhaps to those he is destined to help. Some souls are specifically marked as belonging to the Master; however \\"the new applicants can also be accepted.\\" =Love versus attachment= Love is the criterion for the life of a human being. God is Love and love is God and the way back to God is also through Love, as the Master is Love Personified and the Sound Current is also a conscious current of love. However, the only true form of love from the perspective of life lived in this world, is called devotion. All other forms of love are either debased through egotism or else a form of confusion and delusion, brought on at the level of mind. The nature of romantic love as a form of suffering is relentlessly analysed: Fundamentally, no one can love unless they are connected to God, as God is the source of Love and is sometimes described as Love itself. Our minds, on the other hand, are totally devoid of love: All relationships fall away in what might be called the doctrine of individual responsibility: Notes References  External links  * Thakar Singh Online Audio/Video/Text Library at www.thakar-singh.com * Thakar Singh's Teachings in his own words at www.thakar-singh.org * About Thakar Singh, by people who knew him personally at www.thakar-singh.net Category:1929 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Indian Hindu spiritual teachers Category:Radha Soami Category:Sant Mat gurus Category:20th-century Hindu religious leaders ","title":"Thakar Singh"},{"id":"2504840","text":"Jean-Yves Prieur, Kid Loco is a French electronic musician, DJ, remixer and producer.

Zimmerman played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs and New York Giants from 1907 to 1919. A good hitter, he won the National League triple crown in 1912. He was also known for his poor performance in the 1917 World Series, and his baseball career ended when he was banned for fixing games. Career Zimmerman was born in New York City in 1887. He started his professional baseball career with the New York State League's Wilkes-Barre Barons in 1906.\\"Heinie Zimmerman Minor Leagues Statistics & History\\". baseball- reference.com. Retrieved May 18, 2020. The following season, he was purchased by the Chicago Cubs. He was a part of the Cubs teams that won the World Series in 1907 and 1908, although he received limited playing time. Within the next few years, he became a regular player. In 1912, Zimmerman won the NL triple crown, leading the league with a .372 batting average, 14 home runs, and 104 runs batted in. He also led the league with 207 hits and a 170 OPS+.\\"Heinie Zimmerman Stats\\". baseball-reference.com. Retrieved May 18, 2020. He never played as well again but remained a productive player. In 1916, Zimmerman was traded to the New York Giants. He led the NL in RBI that season, with 83. He led the NL in RBI again in 1917, with 100. The Giants then lost the 1917 World Series, and Zimmerman played poorly, batting .120. Zimmerman became known for an infamous play in the decisive sixth game of the series. In the fourth inning, the game was scoreless when Eddie Collins of the Chicago White Sox was caught between third base and home plate. Catcher Bill Rariden ran up the line to start a rundown, expecting pitcher Rube Benton or first baseman Walter Holke to cover the plate. However, neither of them moved, and Collins blew past Rariden to score the series-winning run. With no one covering the plate, third baseman Zimmerman was forced to chase Collins, pawing helplessly in the air with the ball in a futile attempt to tag him. Zimmerman was long blamed for losing the game, although Giants manager John McGraw blamed Benton and Holke for failing to cover the plate.Richard A. Smiley in SABR's 2006 edition of The National Pastime The play was actually quite close, as action photos show Zimmerman leaping over the sliding Collins.A quote often attributed to Zimmerman, but actually invented by writer Ring Lardner years later, was that when asked about the incident Zim replied, \\"Who the hell was I supposed to throw to, Klem (umpire Bill Klem, who was working the plate)?\\" After a lot of public criticism for his World Series performance, Zimmerman had a mediocre season in 1918. In 1919, the Giants acquired Hal Chase, and he and Zimmerman tried to get other players to help them throw games during the season. Zimmerman's actions got him kicked off the team in September 1919, and he never played in organized baseball again. Based on testimony by McGraw during the Black Sox Scandal hearings in the early 1920s, Zimmerman and Chase were both indicted for bribery. Zimmerman denied McGraw's accusations, and neither he nor Chase was ever proven to be directly connected to the Black Sox, but based on a long-term pattern of corruption both were permanently banned from baseball by the Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. According to some historians, Zimmerman had been informally banned after the Giants released him. In 1,456 MLB games played, Zimmerman batted .295 (1566-5304) with 695 runs scored, 275 doubles, 105 triples, 58 home runs, 799 RBI, 175 stolen bases, a .331 on-base percentage, and a .419 slugging percentage in 13 seasons. In 12 World Series games, he hit .163 (7-43) with 2 RBI. In the 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Zimmerman as the 51st greatest third baseman of all-time.James, Bill.

Origins Hungerford was the son of Walter de Hungerford of Heytesbury, Wiltshire, thrice a Member of Parliament for Wiltshire, in 1331/2, 1333/4 and 1336. His mother was Elizabeth FitzJohn, daughter and heiress of Sir Adam FitzJohn of Cherhill in Wiltshire. The Hungerford family had been seated in Wiltshire since at least the twelfth century. =Uncle= Thomas's uncle was Robert Hungerford (d.1355), a Member of Parliament for Wiltshire in 1316 and a commissioner to inquire into the possessions of the Despensers after their attainder in 1328, and gave much land to the hospital at Calne in memory of his first wife, Joan, to the church of Hungerford, Berkshire, and to other religious foundations. He was buried in 1355 in Hungerford Church, where an elaborate monument long existed above his grave. An inscription to his memory is still extant in the church. His second wife was Geva, widow of Adam de Stokke, but he left no issue.Lee Vol 28, p. 257 cf. GouGrH, Sepulchral Monuments, i. 107, plate xxxviii; Notes and Queries, 2nd ser. viii. 464, ix. 49, 165, 293. Career Hungerford was Sheriff of Wiltshire from 1355 to 1360 and served several times as a Member of Parliament for Wiltshire: in April 1357, in 1360, 1362, January 1376/7, twice in 1380, in 1383, 1384, 1386, January 1389/90, and in January 1392/3. He served as a Member of Parliament for Somerset in 1378, 1382, 1388, and 1390. He was returned for both constituencies in 1384 and January 1389/90. He was knighted in February 1375. He was closely associated with John of Gaunt and acted for some time as steward of Gaunt's household. Owing to Gaunt's influence, he was chosen in January 1376/7, in the last of Edward III's parliaments (the Bad Parliament), to act as Speaker of the House of Commons.Lee Vol 28, p. 258 Cites: Stubbs, Constit. Hist. 1883, ii. 456. According to the Rolls of Parliament (ii. 374) Hungerford \\"avait les paroles pur les communes d'Angleterre en cet parliament\\" ('[he] spoke for the commons of England in this Parliament'). He is thus the first person formally mentioned in the Rolls of Parliament as holding the office of speaker. Sir Peter de la Mare preceded him in the post, without the title, in the Good Parliament of 1376.Lee, Vol 28, p. 258 Cites: cf. Stubbs, iii. 453. In 1380 Hungerford was appointed Forester of Selwood. In 1369 he purchased from Walter Pavely, de jure Baron Burghersh, the manor of Farleigh Montfort, now called Farleigh Hungerford, which served as the chief residence of his descendants, and in 1383 obtained licence to crenellate his manor house there, which thus became Farleigh Castle. In about 1384 he aroused the suspicion of King Richard II, who attached him, but he obtained a pardon and also a confirmation of his free warren at Farleigh.Lee Vol 28, p. 258.

History  Poll was already inhabited during the New Stone Age; etymologically the name originates in a meaning like Swamp. The first documentary mentioning of Poll was on 1. April 1003 by monks from nearby Deutz Abbey, which was part of the Electorate of Cologne. The village Poll was suburbanized in 1889 and became a quarter of Cologne. Since 1975 it is part of city district Porz.  Transportation  Poll is served by the Bundesautobahn 4, Bundesautobahn 559 and three light rail stations of the Cologne Stadtbahn line 7. The Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge connects Poll with Rodenkirchen. Destroyed due to an airstrike on 14 January 1945 it was rebuilt from 1952 to 1954.

The mosque has existed there since 1989 as an Islamic prayer house mainly for Turkish Muslims.  Name and organisation  The official Turkish name of the mosque is Diyanet ƒ∞≈üleri T√ºrk ƒ∞slam Merkezi, or \\"German Turkish-Islamic Center for the Institute for Religion\\". This is shortened to DITIM, and is also designated to the mosque association, to which 42 members and their families belong. The association is linked to the federation Diyanet ƒ∞≈üleri T√ºrk ƒ∞slam Birliƒüi (DITIB), and stands under the supervision of the Turkish president for Religious Affairs Diyanet ƒ∞≈üleri Bakanlƒ±ƒüƒ±. DITIB also selects the imam of the mosque, who usually speaks little German and is a civil servant of the Turkish state. DITIB also operates two other mosques in Munich, in Passing, and Allach. The Schanzenbachstra√üe Mosque is the biggest of the three mosques in Munich, and is laid out for approximately 130 visitors. This has proved in practice untenable, as at peak times, up to 700 visitors come to pray.  Plan to build a new mosque  For that reason, DITIB submitted 2004 plans for a change to the building, which has caused resistance among people living near the building. Therefore, DITIB worked with the city of Munich to help find a suitable place for a new building, at Gotzinger Place. However, those new building plans were also attacked, and the press have covered the arguments since spring 2005, under the title Sendlinger Mosque Controversy.

The host, the program announcer, or a continuity announcer states the title (if any) of the presentation, the name of the program, and the broadcast or cable network, though not necessarily in that order. On children's television networks, they are sometimes called external eyecatches due to the resemblance of internal eyecatches in anime and there is usually no voice over, but some bumpers do feature one. Bumper music, often a recurring signature or theme music segment, is nearly always featured. Bumpers can vary from simple text to short films.  United States  Since 1976, most network television programs in the United States no longer use commercial bumpers; although some soap operas such as Days of Our Lives (which stopped using one in 2010) and The Young and the Restless, as well as the game show The Price is Right, still feature mid-show bumpers. Commercial bumpers are still a common feature of radio. In radio, they are often used during sports broadcasts to ease the transition from play by play to commercial break and back to live action, as well as notify local stations that they should insert their station identification and/or commercials, many times using obscure musical selections of the board operator's choosing. One notable example of commercial bumpers still in use can be found on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, whose extensive usage of bumpers has even spawned its own website.bumpworthy.com Another example of commercial bumpers in radio was their use in syndicated programming; for instance, the radio countdown programs American Top 40 and American Country Countdown feature a series of pre-recorded jingles and other outcues to transition to and from commercial breaks. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, in accordance with then-current regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission that required a distinction between programs and commercials, most children's programming bumpers would include the phrase \\"We'll be [right] back after these messages\\" (or variations of it), except for the bump before the final commercial break, which would usually say, \\"And now, these messages\\" (or variations of this phrase). The FCC significantly relaxed these rules in 1984, although to this day some networks still air these bumpers, particularly during programming that airs Sunday nights at 7 PM/6 PM Central that is not a news or information program such as 60 Minutes.Singer, Jerome L. Handbook of Children and the Media (Sage, 2002). 385-386. . Another common bumper phrase was \\"And now, a word from our sponsor.\\"  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, a break-bumper is a brief appearance of a logo before or after advertising breaks, usually that of the television channel being watched. Break-bumpers can either be animated or static. They are sometimes branded to advertise a special programme or event that will be broadcast on that channel, such as sporting events.  Australia  In Australia, a break-bumper can be a brief appearance of a programme logo, animated logo, title card or an animated title card, just before an advertising break. Break-bumpers can also be either animated or static information bars that appear for a few seconds, with program title and the logo of the television channel being watched. These are more often seen after a break and sometimes followed by information bars that show what programme is coming next or later.  Japan  In Japan, an or internal eyecatch is a scene or illustration used to begin and end a commercial break in a television program, especially in anime and tokusatsu shows. The term is used, in Japan, to refer to all kinds of bumpers. In many television series, eyecatches are contemporaneous into the climax of a story, leading onto speculation during the commercial break. Unlike in American programs, in which bumpers are typically supplied by the network (when they have them at all), eyecatches are almost always produced by the production company and considered a part of the program itself, rather than (or also serving as) a segue into a commercial break. They are typically two to six seconds in length. Eyecatches for children's programs are often longer and more elaborate, while eyecatches for programming intended for adults may consist of nothing more than the program's logo against a black background. The term is used in the title of the 1991 Japanese film Eyecatch Junction.  Malaysia  In the 1990s, commercial bumpers were used by terrestrial television networks. Similar to those in the United Kingdom, it is a short appearance of a logo or a slide to remind the viewers of the programme being aired, which appears before or after breaks. The logo is usually that of the television channel or station being watched and/or of the programme's title. However, as the years passed on until the late 2000s, this changed to feature a message that the programme will return after the break ends, which is now more commonly seen on RTM's TV1 and TV2 and Media Prima's NTV7, 8TV and TV9. TV3 also uses this for sponsored programmes, but as of 2013, it also uses them for non-sponsored programs, such as children's programmes. The 1990s bumper style, however, is sometimes used sparingly. Since 2003, nearly all of Astro's satellite television channels feature break bumpers that are placed before and after breaks. These bumpers consist of the logo of the aforementioned channels, as well as a slide promoting the current programme being broadcast and the next programme scheduled to air. Bumpers based on the subscription information sequence seen at the end of Astro Box Office promotional trailers from 2003 to 2006, appear in-between commercials and immediately before the program break ends, but not at the beginning of the block of replaced commercials.  Philippines  In the Philippines, one notable example of a television network that use break bumpers is ABS-CBN. From 1987 to 2005, its break bumper featured the stars zooming in on a black background, based on the Star Network era. This was the longest break bumper to be used by the network since its relaunch in 1986, being used for 18 years. In 2005, five years after the 2000 ABS-CBN logo was unveiled, the 1987 break bumper was replaced with the one that takes place on a blue background, with the network's 2000 logo appearing on a screen and when it zooms out, it places on a box or crystal plane and then the logo zooms in. The 2005 break bumper was used until February 4, 2014. On February 5, 2014, due to the introduction of the network's 2014 and current logo, the break bumper was again changed, this time taking place on a white background, with the 2014 ABS-CBN logo appearing on a screen, red, green and blue strings representing the colors of the network's logo appear while the logo is being zoomed out, and it zooms in. These bumpers last for 2 seconds and are played after the commercial, but since late 2014, the 2014 break bumper can either be played after the title card that shows when the program pauses or after the advertisements. Since 2016, the 2014 bumper is shown in widescreen or letterboxed format, making the first break bumper to be in 16:9 aspect ratio.  In other countries  In Argentina, since around September 2010, it is compulsory for almost all broadcasters to use a commercial bumper, using the words \\"Espacio publicitario\\" (Commercial break) to separate the rest of the programme from the advertisements. In Poland, television networks usually separate the rest of the programming with the word \\"Reklama\\" (\\"Commercial\\"). One of the examples are TVP's ones: First one was used since 1989 until 1990 and it consisted an ad agency's logo (eye in a form of letter S) in a black background with Indigo 3D stars. Second one was used until 1992, which consisted newer ad agency logo (Loop in a form of during this time acronym (TP) with a ball) and a word \\"REKLAMA\\" in lower left corner in a black (until 1991 blue) background. Third one was used in early 1992 and it was a laser smashing an metal ball, in which later rotating 'REKLAMA' appears and in the same year, later version was appeared, in which squares (or diagonal stripes, depending on channel) rotated the same word (and the same font) as previous. This one was used until launch of 1995 one (Inspired by gyroscope), in which was used until 1997. Later, in late 1990's, this bumpers were used, depending on era, but had one thing: word in a ball (except July‚ÄìAugust 1999, in which an \\"Meandres\\" series was used). Since 2000 (except 2012-2015, in which were was in both channels, inspired by kaleidoskope), graphics are now separated, and TVP1 since 2010 with newer graphic technologies, (TVP2 has the same since 2007), formerly, they had inspired by art (TVP1 - 2000-2010, TVP2 - 2000-2007), or by real-life ones (TVP1 had two bumpers inspired with it in which first ones was used for short period in 2010, second ones was used until 2012, TVP2 also had ones from the same era, but in a colors: Blue (in Winter) or purple (other seasons) and Orange, the same technique is used in current branding since 2015, but in all colors). In German-languaged countries, it is the same, but with the word \\"Werbung\\" (Advertisement), but, in Switzerland, this word is also used in different languages: French: Publicit√© or Pub in short; Italian: Publicit√†. The same goes for France and Italy, but only second and third ones are writtened, respectevly. In Russia, networks like Channel One and Russia 1 use the commercial bumpers as they appear as a one-off bumper. Channel One used the commercial idents as sting thru November 2004 to 31 August 2011 , As they started to use the short-lived commercial ident package called \\"The Four Seasons\\" which ran thru 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2012 , In these commercial idents the music was actually mostly classical with piano and violins, As they started to use the current commercial ident package \\"Clocks\\" which featured three separate piano pieces \\"Morning\\" (September 2012 to September 2013) and the popular \\"Noon\\" (which is the one that is the current piano piece should be used to this day) and \\"Night\\" (which they have started to use in 2016) they also used the 3-note piece as their three commercial idents debuted in 2012 and used the 3-note piece. In the international versions of these idents, They have used the information about to suggest an commercial. But networks like NTV use the commercial idents as an intro and outro idents. One of the famous commercial ident from NTV is the \\"Rectangle on the NTV\\" which has been used as an ident thru 6 September 1998 to 31 May 2001. Which in these idents feature the NTV logo being in an rectangle-shaped scope. At the beginning of each idents, the reminiscent of the commercial idents from 1996 or 1994. In the end of the commercials, flag and a part of the ident is shown. Another one is the short-lived one used from 1 June to 8 September 2001. Which in these commercial idents show the metal soviet pieces from 1980s and 1990s. Basically new year idents of Channel One are always festive. starting with 1995 when the famous things of Christmas should be shown like Santa Claus and Christmas Tree and especially Spasskaya Tower. 1996 shouldn't have a festive offering but logo is in snow. Starting with 1997, new year commercial idents are born. First of them would be the one with a snowman doing something weird. These commercial idents are ran from 24 December 1997 to 11 January 1998. Some of the most memorable new year commercial idents from Channel One we're the 2008 one. which features a Christmas tree with cards being animated. This one was ran thru 22 December 2008 to 11 January 2009 and returned in 21 December 2009 to 10 January 2010. Which the 2010 one had an inspiration from A Trip to the Moon featured an rocket's adventures in Moscow. For some reason the commercial idents did not have the word \\"—Ä–µ–∫–ª–∞–º–∞\\" when it was uploaded to Vimeo. Actually in the TV version did have the word \\"—Ä–µ–∫–ª–∞–º–∞\\". This ran from 20 December 2010 to 10 January 2011. But the Channel One had brought back the 2008 one in December 2011, Only difference is that the scope is now in 16:9. And the 2008 ident had being repeated in 2012 and 2013. Bumpers on children's television Bumpers or external eyecatches on children's television networks, and sometimes other networks, are similar to the internal eyecatches used in Japanese anime, with the difference being that the bumpers are supplied by the network. These usually appear only at the end of commercial breaks, but sometimes leading into the start of the break as well. Their primary purpose is to alert children that the commercial break has ended. Depending on the network, the bumper may or may not feature a voice over.An example of Children's TV Network bumpers (old bumpers from YTV)Another example of Children's TV Network bumpers (old bumpers from Cartoon Network) Often, these eyecatches have a secondary purpose: marketing. Canadian network YTV, for example, uses them to help children learn to identify the network and thus increase brand awareness. Most children's television networks run these bumpers because of this reason. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s periods, Nickelodeon in conjunction with branding firm Fred/Alan, Inc. created 225 bumpers, some featuring catchy disco jingles recorded by a cappella group The Jive Five.

It is the world's first museum dedicated to the literary character Sherlock Holmes. It opened in 1990 and is situated in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B by permission of the City of Westminster, although it lies between numbers 237 and 241, near the north end of Baker Street in central London close to Regent's Park. The Georgian town house which the museum occupies as \\"221B Baker Street\\" was built in 1815. It was formerly used as a boarding house from 1860 to 1936. It covers the period of 1881 to 1904 when the stories describe Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson residing there as tenants of Mrs Hudson. The house is listed Grade 2 by the Government because of its special architectural and historical features. The museum features exhibits items from several different adaptations of Sherlock Holmes, and recreations of scenes from the 1984 Granada Television series Sherlock Holmes. Numbering dispute Sitting room on 1st floor of the museum The address 221B was the subject of a protracted dispute between the museum and the nearby Abbey National building. Since the 1930s, the Royal Mail had been delivering mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes to the Abbey National Bank, and they had employed a special secretary to deal with such correspondence. The museum went through several appeals for such mail to be delivered to it, on the grounds that it was the most appropriate organisation to respond to the mail, rather than the bank whose primary business was to lend money out on interest. Although these initiatives were all unsuccessful, the issue was finally resolved in 2002 when the Abbey National vacated its headquarters after seventy years, and the mail is currently delivered to the museum. Family objections 221 B front view Jean Conan Doyle made clear her lack of enthusiasm for the museum when she was asked about it. She was very much against the idea of suggesting that her father's creation was a real person and knew that the presence of the museum would reinforce the idea in the minds of many that Holmes had really existed. This idea was strengthened further by the presence of a commemorative blue plaque on the outside that states the years of Holmes's supposed residency. However, Dame Jean Conan Doyle lent her support to the Sherlock Holmes Museum in Switzerland by attending its opening in 1991. Dame Jean was offered the opportunity to create a room in the London museum dedicated to her father, but this offer was refused, and since then the last remaining possessions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have been sold off at auction.

He was a specialist professional batsman, usually third in the batting order, who rarely bowled and generally fielded in outfield positions. Born at Worsley, Lancashire, Tyldesley began his first-class career with Lancashire in 1895 and was a regular player until the First World War began in August 1914. He played Test cricket from 1899 to 1909. Tyldesley served in the British Army during the war, attaining the rank of corporal, and then recommenced his Lancashire career in 1919. He effectively retired from first- class cricket at the end of that season but did make one further appearance in 1923. Through the 1920s, Tyldesley ran a sports goods shop on Deansgate in Manchester. He played for Lancashire Second XI for some years until the end of the 1926 season when he concentrated on coaching, remaining with Lancashire and running his business until he died, aged 57, at his home in Monton, Eccles, Lancashire. Early years Johnny Tyldesley was born at Roe Green, Worsley on 22 November 1873 and received his early training in Lancashire club cricket, described by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \\"a very stiff school\\". He played for the Worsley Cricket Club in 1892 and 1893 before joining the Lancashire Second XI in 1894. Wisden considered him \\"a well equipped batsman\\" when he made his first-class debut for Lancashire in 1895. Tyldesley was often formally referred to by his initials but was generally known as \\"Johnny\\" or as \\"John Tommy\\". First-class career =Lancashire : 1895 to 1898= Tyldesley made his first-class debut, also his County Championship debut, on 22 July 1895, playing for Lancashire against Gloucestershire in a drawn match at Old Trafford. Batting in the middle order, he scored 13 and 33 not out. In his second match for Lancashire, Tyldesley scored 152 not out with 17 fours and 1 six against Warwickshire on a rain-affected pitch at Edgbaston, enabling Lancashire to win by an innings and 54 runs. He played in ten first-class matches in 1895 and 17 in 1896. His innings at Edgbaston remained his only century in that period, though he scored six half-centuries in 1896 with a top score of 68. Having been runners-up five times in the previous six seasons, Lancashire won their first official County Championship title in 1897. Tyldesley began the season with a run of indifferent scores and did not make a half-century until his fourteenth match, starting on 1 July at Old Trafford, when he scored 54 and 53 against Essex. He followed up with three successive centuries, scoring 106 and 100 not out in the same match against Warwickshire at Edgbaston and then 174, his highest score to date, against Sussex at Old Trafford. After that, his form lapsed again and, apart from one innings of 68 against Somerset at Old Trafford, he made low scores only, including four ducks, in the remainder of the season. He generally batted at number five for Lancashire in 1897. His season tally was 1,017 runs in 26 matches at the average of 30.81. He scored three centuries, three half-centuries and held 13 catches. He surpassed 1,000 runs in a season for the first time, going on to achieve the feat in each of nineteen successive seasons. Tyldesley scored 1,918 runs in 1898 including his first double-century. He was invited to join Lord Hawke's tour of South Africa the following winter. =England tour of South Africa : 1898‚Äì99= Tyldesley played for England for the first time against South Africa in 1898‚Äì99. He hit a decisive 112 in one of the Tests. =Lancashire and England : 1899 to 1900= England team v. Australia, Trent Bridge 1899. Back row: Dick Barlow (umpire), Tom Hayward, George Hirst, Billy Gunn, J T Hearne (12th man), Bill Storer (wkt kpr), Bill Brockwell, V A Titchmarsh (umpire). Middle row: C B Fry, K S Ranjitsinhji, W G Grace (captain), Stanley Jackson. Front row: Wilfred Rhodes, Johnny Tyldesley. In 1899, Tyldesley played his first Ashes Tests at Trent Bridge and Lord's. He failed in these matches, but by this time was established as a top-class batsman with a superb range of strokes and wonderful footwork that made him effective even on pitches where the ball had considerable spin it did after rain in those days. =1901 season= In the 1901 season, Tyldesley scored 3,041 runs in first-class matches. As a result, he was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1902 edition. Wisden commented that he would have done even better but for the unpredictable state of the Old Trafford pitch in the early part of the season. =England tour of Australia : 1901‚Äì02= Tyldesley was not at his best in the Tests. =Lancashire and England : 1902 to 1903= In 1902 his \\"superb\\" 138 in four and a half hours at Edgbaston was critical in placing England in a winning position. Almost twenty years later, Jessop remarked on the accuracy of his cutting. For Lancashire his batting, regardless of the weather, was \\"consistently brilliant\\". =England tour of Australia : 1903‚Äì04= Tyldesley toured Australia in 1903‚Äì04 and, despite again not making a Test hundred, he played an outstanding innings on a \\"sticky wicket\\" in the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He was dismissed for 97 in England's first innings when they totalled 315 over the first two days of the match. Rain caused the pitch to deteriorate badly on the third day and Australia were all out for 122, of which Victor Trumper scored 74. England struggled to 74/5 at the close with Tyldesley 48 not out. On the morning of the fourth day, he reached 62 before being dismissed with the England score at 90/8. England were all out for 103 and then dismissed Australia for 111 to win the match by 185 runs. England's captain Pelham Warner said of Tyldesley's 62 that \\"surely a better innings has never been played on a bad wicket\\". =Lancashire and England : 1904 to 1910= \\"Forty-six centuries in eleven years.\\" Johnny Tyldesley as caricatured by \\"Spy\\" (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, August 1906. For the rest of the 1900s Tyldesley was, despite the emergence of Hobbs always in the forefront of English professional batting and seldom failed to be near the top of the batting averages, which he headed in the wet summer of 1910 with an average of 46. Though the 1905 Ashes series was his most successful with two centuries, from the following year Tyldesley gradually dropped out of the representative scene, playing his last Test in 1909. However, in 1906 against that year County Champions, Kent, Tyldesley made his highest score of 295 not out and would certainly have made a triple hundred had he not ran out of partners. With Reggie Spooner rarely available owing to business calls between 1907 and 1910, and Archie MacLaren declining, Lancashire were much too dependent upon Tyldesley to make a respectable score and he played superbly especially when one considers the fire in Old Trafford pitches in fine weather at that time. =Lancashire : 1911 to 1919= For Lancashire he remained a potent force right up to the outbreak of World War I and, in 1919, he made 272 against Derbyshire. Tyldesley served in the British Army during the war and attained the rank of corporal. Style and technique According to Neville Cardus, Tyldesley was one of the greatest of Lancashire batsmen. Cardus agreed with Wisden that Tyldesley was exceptionally quick on his feet and therefore always seemed to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Tyldesley was very strong, despite his small size, with quick reflexes and great flexibility in his wrists which assisted both his strokeplay and, when fielding, his throwing. He was especially noted as a batsman for his mastery of the square cut and his fighting qualities in difficult conditions; he played many noted innings on bad wickets. Tyldesley was an outstanding fielder who specialised in deep positions, mostly at third man or deep long on, and was noted for his speed and ability to quickly gather and accurately return the ball. A. A. Thomson gave the view that Tyldesley and David Denton were the two best outfielders in England. There is an oil painting by Albert Chevallier Tayler of a match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury in August 1906, the season in which Kent won their first official County Championship title. The painting shows Colin Blythe, the pavilion behind him, bowling to Tyldesley who has his back to the artist. Tyldesley is depicted as very still, even though delivery is imminent, with an orthodox stance. Kent won the match by an innings and 195 runs, Tyldesley scoring 19 and 4. Coaching At the end of the 1919 season, Tyldesley retired to concentrate on his business but also took a coaching post with Lancashire. He played one match as Lancashire's first professional captain in 1923 but by then his health was declining. As cricket coach he played a major role in Lancashire's County Championship successes in the late 1920s. Lancashire won the County Championship twice (1897 and 1904) during Tyldesley's playing career. While he was coaching, they won the title four times in five seasons from 1926 to 1930, finishing second in 1929. Family and business A. A. Thomson described Tyldesley as a \\"skilled, intelligent, well-mannered artisan\\" who was kindly, studious and without malice. On long journeys, while his colleagues played cards, Tyldesley would read a book. He was a family man with wife Rachel Jane, son Arnold Clifford and daughter Edith Eleanor. Like some other cricket professionals including Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe, Tyldesley went into the sports goods business and opened a shop on Deansgate in central Manchester which he ran through the 1920s. He had been granted a benefit match by Lancashire, against Yorkshire at Old Trafford in 1906, which realised a profit of ¬£3,105. Wisden recorded in Tyldesley's obituary that he had been in weak health for some years. He died at his home in Monton on the morning of 27 November 1930 after he collapsed whilst putting on his boots before going to work at his shop on Deansgate. He was buried at Worsley Parish Church, his wife and children eventually being laid to rest in the same grave. His younger brother Ernest Tyldesley (1889‚Äì1962) was also a top-class batsman for Lancashire and played in 14 Tests for England.

Most of the original structure was subsequently destroyed by an earthquake. It was later destroyed by the Persian king Khosrau II in AD 613. It was rebuilt in AD 1229 by Assad ud-Din Shirkoh, an Ayyubid governor of Homs. The castle was rebuilt by the Ayyubid Cherkouh. The date of this reconstruction was set by Abu Fida in 626 e (1228), while Muhammad Kurd Ali in his book \\"al-Sham Plans\\" fixed the 627th (1229). However, the Mongols destroyed it in 1260 and then by the Tatars in 1401. It was rebuilt after the expulsion of the Mongols and Tatars from Syria. The castle today is in ruins with only walls partially preserved. This castle was built on a basaltic layer covering a conical top of the mountain. This summit is surrounded by a moat 15 m depth, and provides a very deep well to meet the water needs for the castle, and another well for supplies. The walls of the latter well were covered with a layer of lime and sludge. The castle housed the royal palace, as well as foundations for housing soldiers. The importance of this castle is due to its location which allows to observe a circular area of more than 50 km in diameter.

He received India's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna in 1963 for his scholarly work that spanned more than 40 years of active academic research that resulted in 6,500 pages of History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra. The historian Ram Sharan Sharma says: \\"Pandurang Vaman Kane, a great Sanskritist wedded to social reform, continued the earlier tradition of scholarship. His monumental work entitled the \\"History of the Dharmasastra\\", published in five volumes in the twentieth century, is an encyclopedia of ancient social laws and customs. This enables us to study the social processes in ancient India.\\" Famous works The town hall of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, whose resources Kane researched; Later, the Asiatic Society commemorated him with an institute in his name Dr. Kane is famous for his magnum opus in English, History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra, subtitled Ancient and Mediaeval Religions and Civil Law in India. This work researched the evolution of code of conduct in ancient and mediaeval India by looking into several texts and manuscripts compiled over the centuries. It was published in five volumes; the 1st volume was published in 1930 and the last, in 1962. It runs to a total of more than 6,500 pages. Dr. Kane used the resources available at prestigious institutes such as the Asiatic Society of Mumbai and Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, among others. The work is known for its expanse and depth ‚Äì ranging across diverse subjects such as the Mahabharata, the Puranas and Chanakya ‚Äì including references to previously obscure sources. The richness in the work is attributed to his in-depth knowledge of Sanskrit. His success is believed to be an outcome of his objective study of the texts instead of deifying them. Kane wrote the book Vyavaharamayukha and was in the process of writing an introductory passage on the History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra for this book so that the reader would get an overall idea apart from the subject of the book. One thing led to another and this project snowballed into the major work that it is. All the same, he was categorical in saying that it is difficult to find an English equivalent of the word \\"Dharma.\\" His output in the form of writings across the three languages of English, Sanskrit and Marathi spans nearly 15,000 pages. ‚ÄòHistory of Poetics‚Äô was one of his other great books. Apart from Theology and Poetry, he wrote a great deal on other topics too, which included Astrology, Cultural and Geographical history of India-Maharashtra-Konkan- Vidarbha, Marathi language, its grammar, language & handwriting, economics of Kautilya (Chanakya), Mathematics, Dramatics, etc. There are in all 198 publications by his name. They include 39 texts, 115 articles, 44 books, introductions and reviews. Recognition Dr. Kane was rewarded as Mahamahopadhyaya (Etymology: Maha+Maha+Upadhyay = The greatest among the great teachers), usually shortened to MM as a prefix in the writings that refer to him. He served as the vice-chancellor of the University of Mumbai. His services were requisitioned and enlisted for establishing Kurukshetra University in Indic studies. He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi award in 1956 for History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra, vol. IV for his research under the Sanskrit translation category. He was also an honorary member of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha as a member of Parliament for his distinguished record in the field of academics. The highest accolade bestowed upon him was the Bharat Ratna in 1963. Indian law Kane believed that the constitution of India made a complete break with the traditional ideas prevalent in India by engendering a false notion among the people that they have rights but no obligations. Given the encyclopaedic and authoritative nature of his work, it is often used in debates in Polity. One such issue that cropped up during Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was whether ancient Indians ate beef and both the groups quoted extensively from Kane's work to support their viewpoint. This issue became important as Hindus traditionally revere the cow as a mother and hence eating of beef is prohibited. Another such issue was whether the girls in the ancient times had the right to wear the yajnopavita (sacred thread), as the upanayana ceremony was restricted only to the men in the recent past. Legacy To commemorate him, the Asiatic Society of Mumbai has established the Mm. Dr. P.V. Kane Institute for Post Graduate studies and Research in 1974 to promote, encourage and facilitate research in oriental studies. Also, MM Dr. P.V.

Its historic capital is La Rochelle, which took over from Castrum Allionis (Ch√¢telaillon) the historic capital which gives its name to the province. It was a fief of the Duchy of Aquitaine. It extended to Marais Poitevin in the north, Basse Saintonge (and Niortais) in the east, and Rochefortais in the south. Aunis had an influence approximately 20‚Äì25 km into the Isle of R√© (l'√éle de R√©). The province was officially recognised during the reign of Charles V of France in 1374: \\"In 1374, Charles V separated La Rochelle from Saintonge to set up a provincial government, comprising the jurisdictions of Rochefort, Marennes and, for a time, Benon. It was thus that Aunis legally became a separate province.\\" Aunis was the smallest province in France, in terms of area. Nowadays it is a part of the Charente-Maritime d√©partement together with Saintonge. People from Aunis were called Aunisien (masculine) or Aunisienne (feminine). The English term is Aunisian.  Geography  Aunis is mostly a rolling chalk plain, whose navigable rivers have always been important modes of communication, and from which came economic development and the urbanisation of the region. The region is coastal, with varied seafronts and offshore islands, from which maritime activities diversified. Nowadays tourism is of great importance. = Geographic framework = Aunis has two river borders, those of the S√®vre Niortaise in the north, and the Charente River in the south. To the west is the Atlantic Ocean and two islands, the √éle de R√© and the √éle d'Aix. To the east it is bordered by the valley of the Mignon River (the main left tributary of the S√®vre Niortaise), by the hills of Saintonge around Saint-F√©lix, and by the valleys of the Tr√©zence and Boutonne.The territorial boundaries of Aunis have changed a lot over time. Those described here omit enlargement eastwards; for practical reasons, the borders are \\"usually\\" confined to administrative limits of the cantons of Surg√®res and Tonnay-Charente Chalk cliffs to the north and south of La Rochelle date from the Late Jurassic. Aunis is a chalk plain of the Jurassic period, characterised by gently rolling hills, where no valley is completely enclosed, and where the land has a regular descent towards the sea. The islands of R√© and Aix were made at the same time and from the same type of rock. The chalk table completes the triangular promontory which juts into the Atlantic, forming the northern extremity of the Aquitaine Basin. Large freshwater and seawater marshes have formed in places that have been drained, hardly altering the general relief. The seawater marshes correspond to ancient marine gulfs, made from marine or fluvial sediments. Since the Middle Ages they have been continuously drained by people. In the north, the Marais Poitevin dries up, at the centre there are the valleys of the small river Cur√© and its main tributary the Virson and in the east the valley of the Mignon River). In the south is the marshland of \\"Little Flanders\\" (), drained since the 17th century. Together these constitute an important reservoir of fresh water, essential for the agricultural and snail- farming activities of the north of the department. = Transport = The geography of the plain was always very unfavourable for communications. The region was almost an enclave, and for a long time on the margins of the French kingdom politically as well as geographically.This regional enclave was even more isolated by the marshes () ‚Äì Marais Poitevin, Marais de Rochefort ‚Äì which were for much of history obstacles for overland travel Huge efforts were made to break this geographical isolation. Without doubt the most spectacular was the coming of the railway in 1857, running from La Rochelle and Rochefort to Paris. This line has been repeatedly modernised (made double track, and electrified in 1993 for use by the TGV). The regional railways connecting Nantes to Bordeaux also serve Aunis, passing through La Rochelle, Ch√¢telaillon-Plage and Rochefort. Roads have also been considerably modernised, notably the roads from La Rochelle to Rochefort, from La Rochelle to Niort, the A837 autoroute from Rochefort to Saintes, the viaduct over the Charente River at Rochefort, the ring road around La Rochelle, and the bridge to the √éle de R√©, all of which are now dual carriageways. The modernisation of communication infrastructure had its heyday in the second half of the 19th century, at the end of the Second French Empire, and economic activity diversified. = Agricultural and maritime activities = The two principal agricultural resources are intensive arable farming (wheat, maize, oil seed) and livestock farming. Dairy cows have long been the mainstay, but more and more cows and bulls are raised for beef (principally in the marshy areas). Vineyards were virtually abandoned after phylloxera wiped them out in 1876, although there are still some on the √éle de R√©. At sea, between the estuary of the S√®vre Niortaise and the north of La Rochelle, mussel farming () has an important place, while Fouras and the Marais d'Yves Nature Reserve are the main centres for oyster farming. La Rochelle keeps its place as a fishing port thanks to its modern port of Chef-de-Baie, but even so fishing is in decline.The port of La Rochelle is no longer practically used for industrial- scale fishing, but was ranked the 4th largest French fishing port in the early 1970s. Nowadays it is the second fishing port of the Charente-Maritime department, behind Cotini√®re, on the √éle d'Ol√©ron The salt marshes and l'or blanc (\\"White Gold\\") salt are important natural resources of the √éle de R√© Reclamation of sea salt from the marshes of Aunis brought the region its riches in the Middle Ages, but this has now completely disappeared from the coast of mainland Aunis. However, it still takes place on the √éle de R√© and notably on the nearby √éle d'Ars, and has lately achieved a certain notability for its small-volume craft production and minimal postprocessing. In the north-east of Aunis there is a huge forest of hardwood trees, the Forest of Benon, which has been protected because it is unique to the region. With an area of , it is the Aunisiens' \\"green belt\\". = Industrial diversification = *La Rochelle Chamber of Commerce *Rochefort and Saintonge Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aunis does not have the strong industrial tradition which is the trademark of regions of the North and of Lorraine, and it was only at the end of the 19th century that factories started to be developed. After World War II, industry in Aunis continued, was reinforced, diversified and brought up-to-date. Three industrial hubs emerged in Aunis to bring together the industries of Charente-Maritime: * La Rochelle specialised in railway construction (Alstom) and naval construction (Chantiers navals Gamelin), motor parts (Delphi Corporation), food industries (Senoble), chemicals and pharmaceuticals (Rhodia) and pleasure boats (Dufour, Fontaine- Pajot). It is by far the largest hub of the department. It is also a large commercial port, the eighth largest in all France. In 2007 it was granted the status of (\\"self-governing port\\"). * Rochefort and Tonnay-Charente developed port activities on the Charente River. The two towns have diverse industrial activities with aerospace (EADS, Simair), automotive industry, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, chemical and plastics industries, pleasure boating, among them. The industrial area of Rochefort-Tonnay-Charente is the second hub of the department. * Surg√®res has become a hub for the food industry, augmented by metallurgical and plastic industries. In addition there are two smaller, newer industrial areas: Aigrefeuille-d'Aunis and Marans. = Tourism = Quays at Saint-Martin-de-R√© Surg√®res castle, now the town hall Thanks to the sea, Aunis developed its tourist potential which, in the late 19th century, came to the fore with the trend for sea bathing. Bathing beaches such as Ch√¢telaillon- Plage and Fouras gained notability, while the larger beaches such as those of the √éle de R√© became national treasures from the 1960s. The Pertuis d'Antioche, which is effectively an inland sea, was popular for pleasure boating in the 1970s. La Rochelle, with its immense Port des Minimes, can hold pleasure boats, and has become the largest pleasure boating port on the French Atlantic. Ars-en-R√©, La Flotte and Saint-Martin-de-R√© are also well-known pleasure ports, while the river ports of Marans on the S√®vre niortaise, and Rochefort, on the Charente, had disused port basins that have become home to pleasure boats, and can each take more than 200 craft. The √éle de R√© lives totally by tourism and can accommodate up to tourists during the summer season. This \\"invasion\\" is even more pronounced on the √éle d'Aix which accommodates up to tourists each year, even though it does not have a car bridge. Aunis has also developed its cultural and urban tourism with its two great historical towns of La Rochelle and Rochefort. The small towns of the interior are not without interest and have enhanced their heritage sites, like Surg√®res (Notre-Dame church, castle, renovated town centre) and Marans (port and river site), Tonnay-Charente (management of Charente quays). Aunis has made huge efforts to put in place green tourism and has developed, notably at Aigrefeuille-d'Aunis, quality tourist bases (lac de Frace, tourist complex of La Taill√©e).  Demography  In 2006 the region had inhabitants,That is, the urban area of La Rochelle and the \\"rural\\" areas of the √éle de R√©, Aunis and Rochefortais nearly half the total population of Charente-Maritime (47.9%). In 2010, the northwest of the department had ten of the seventeen towns of over inhabitants, and 31 of the department's 60 communes of over inhabitants. The region covers , 21.8% of the whole department. The population density of the region is more than twice that of the departmental average: , compared to for Charente-Maritime as a whole. It is nearly thrice that of the Poitou-Charentes region at and is higher than the national average, which in 2006 was . The ratio of urban to rural population is comparable to the national average, which is 3:4. This is considerably different from Charente-Maritime as a whole, where the ratio is nearer 3:5. The region became considerably more urban after World War II, though the population is unevenly distributed. Above all, the Aunis coastal towns have expanded to provide the larger part of employment and leisure. La Rochelle and Rochefort are the most populous urban areas not just in Aunis but in all Charente-Maritime. The two towns are becoming twin cities with many suburbs, connected by regular railway trains. This heavily built-up area is now home to over inhabitants ( inhabitants in 2006).La Rochelle contributing and Rochefort This urban area is second in the region after the \\"Clain corridor\\", which runs between Poitiers and Ch√¢tellerault. Near the coast the towns have formed a dense urban web and the population density is particularly high: in the three cantons of Rochefort,The cantons of Rochefort Centre, North and South ‚Äì 2006 census (municipal population) in the canton of Aytr√©,This canton combines the communes of Angoulins-sur-Mer, Ch√¢telaillon-Plage and Aytr√© ‚Äì 2006 census (municipal population) in the combined cantons of La Rochelle.La Rochelle cantons 1 ‚Äì 9 and the canton of Aytr√© ‚Äì 2006 census (municipal population) The La Rochelle- Rochefort twin city area alone includes nine towns of the seventeen with more than inhabitants, and twenty communes with more than inhabitants, of the sixty in Charente-Maritime in 2006. The concentration of the population is even greater in the immediate neighbours of La Rochelle, where the canton of La Jarrie had a population density of in 2006.In the community of communes of the Aunis Plain, where the small towns of Aigrefeuille-d'Aunis and La Jarrie are found, the density is nearly ( in 2006) Beyond the La Rochelle-Rochefort twin city area, the population density is lower, and is indeed lower than the departmental average, which was in 2006. The cantons of Aigrefeuille-d'Aunis, Surg√®res and Marans had respectively , and . Only the Canton of Cour√ßon had a density of less than ( in 2006), even though its population surged between 1999 and 2006 by 28.4%. The Pays d'Aunis, an administrative region comprising four communes (Cour√ßon, Pays Marandais, Plaine d'Aunis and Surg√®res), returned a census in 2006 of inhabitants in an area of , giving a density of . It is still a mostly rural region, but is rapidly becoming more built-up. Urbanisation has been just as fast on the √éle de R√©, especially in the east.

The Pays d'Aunis groups together the four 4 \\"communaut√©s de communes\\" of Cour√ßon, Marans, Plaine d'Aunis and Surg√®res, whereas the historical province of Aunis, the subject of this article, constitutes all the north-west of the departement of Charente-Maritime, thus including La Rochelle, the √éle de R√©, and Rochefort. * On the √éle de R√©, Saint-Martin-de-R√© and La Flotte make up a small urban area with inhabitants, but Sainte-Marie-de-R√© is the most populous single commune, with inhabitants.  Toponymy  The name of the province appears for the first time in history in 785 AD. Following the partition of Aquitaine into nine counties, as decreed by Charlemagne in 778, the name of Aunis, written as , appeared in the last will and testament of Count Roger. But the etymology of the name has been given many different interpretationsEven that great 19th- century historian L. Delayant, in his , took a prudent view of the interpretation of its name: \\"The etymology of Aunis, which is found in many different forms in Latin, has been the object of studies between which it is difficult to choose\\". and folk etymologies that are still used today. Even so, some people think \\"The most probable origin is that the town of Aulnay (Aulnay en Saintongeais), which was more important in the Middle Ages than it is today. Aulnay marked the frontier between Santones and Pictones. Little by little the province shrank until the frontier was situated a long way from Aulnay. It is the smallest province in France\\". This interpretation does not pass muster, because there is absolutely no connection between the original names of Aulnay which, in Latin, were written (in 951) or (in 970), so that Aunis, with its older name as seen above, was written or instead . Even now, there is no consensus among historians and etymologists. Etymologists have proposed three possible interpretations which deserve consideration: * the name should be linked to the forest, because the () was very common in mediaeval times; the province became the (\\"Alder Region\\").\\"Aunis was written pagus aliennensis or pagus alnisius; [in French] said \\"pays des aulnes\\". Logically since the sea advanced further into the interior than it does today, this pagus aliniensis was thus a region of lakes. Recall that the alder (Latin: ) enjoys very wet conditions.\\" * the etymology must be interpreted as being cognate with that of an ancient barbaric people. According to some historians, Aunis was populated by a tribe of Alani, who invaded Gaul in 406 AD. Delayant in his time described the idea that the Alani would have settled in Aunis: \\"Their attacks were at first aimed at looting rather than conquest. The Vandals had merely passed through. We must think of their stragglers. Some of them, turned back by the Visigoths, hid (so it is said) in this refuge between S√®vre and the Charente River, and their name furnished one of numerous etymologies that have been given to the word Aunis.\\" * the name of Aunis is related to the eventful history of the town of Ch√¢telaillon in mediaeval times. The first capital of Aunis was in practice Ch√¢telaillon (today Ch√¢telaillon-Plage), designated by its Latin name heard as , . This last theory has found favour with a large number of historians.Delayant, the celebrated historian of the department, does not hesitate to set down his thoughts in his History, where he writes: \\"The least improbable comes from the main town in that settlement of that time, the Castrum Allionis\\".  History  In ancient times the region was a long way from civilisation. It was not until the Middle Ages that the province entered history, when La Rochelle sealed its fate and became its capital. = The \\"pays des aulnes\\" in antiquity = In Celtic and Gallo-Roman times, the northern part of Santonie,, \\"Santone Country\\" which became called \\"Aunis\\", was a long-neglected region far from civilisation, with no communications.See the Roman road maps, entitled \\"Les Santons dans l'Aquitaine du Haut-Empire romain\\", in The old \\"Forest of Argenson\\" covered the entire region. For many centuries this huge forest made a near-impenetrable natural frontier stretching from the Boutonne and Charente Rivers to the east,\\"L'Aunis and western Saintonge [...] were sparse zones, with sparser populations. The [...] terrain was covered with vast forests: the Forest of Argenson, on the borders of Poitou; the Forests of Essouvert, of the Boixe and of Braconne which extended them...\\"\\", in which kept it apart from the ancient province of the Pictones. This was the (), where the trees had established themselves on riverbanks and in the marshy valleys, but where beeches and oaks also made up a dark and mysterious forest, awe-inspiring and full of superstition.Some of these feelings and superstitions are still around Moreover, the deep sea gulfs (Gulf of Pictones, to the north, Gulf of Santones, to the south) made it a slender peninsula.It is described as a \\"chalky isthmus\\" in Its seclusion lent its name as , now Saintonge. This geographic isolation made communications and trade very poor. One can see from a road map of Gallo-Roman times, Aunis is entirely absent. The old Roman road which ran from (now the town of Saintes) to (now the town of Angers) was routed entirely to the east of Aunis. The name of this Roman road remains in some modern place names as (\\"St Felix's Way\\") and (\\"Marshland Way\\"): this is Route d√©partmentale D.120, which runs from Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly until the department's border with Deux-S√®vres. This Roman road is found in the \\"Table de Peutinger\\", where again no Roman road goes into Aunis.See, for example, the map at Finally, the valleys of the rivers Cur√©, Virson, Mignon, and G√®res, which were much larger than today, cut deeply through the region's invading forest. But they had the inconvenience of being marshy and prone to floods that turned them into real marshes and bogs, making the region particularly difficult to reach. All these natural phenomena combined, so that it has been said \\"this region [...], often flooded and marshy, has its riches, is easy to defend, but cannot become the fulcrum for an attack\\". The coast was occupied by the Celts, even during the time of ‚Äì they preferred to call the area Saintonge and themselves Santones ‚Äì and then the Romans in the 1st century BC. Saintonge offered better living and working conditions than the northern area (Aunis) thanks to the large valleys of the Charente River and its two principal tributaries, the Seugne and the Boutonne. The huge Gironde Estuary of the Seudre allowed direct contact with the more advanced civilisation of the Roman Empire to the south, via notably, the Garonne valley. Transport was largely on the waterways, even after the Romans had built their more advanced ‚Äì and more expensive ‚Äì roads. Before the Roman conquest around the middle of the 1st century AD, the Celts had a stronghold over the northern shores of the Gulf of Santones. They had even colonised some of the islands in the gulf, which today are part of the Marais () de Rochefort.These comprise the marsh of \\"la Petite Flandre\\", drained in the 17th century The Santones had worked laboriously to perfect a technique of saltwater extraction, and their ancient production sites were put right on the shoreline. These are (\\"salt sites\\").Thanks to archaeology, dozens of have been found along the ancient shoreline of Aunis, mainly in the area that is now the Marais de Rochefort These small-scale production sites were particularly numerous in the north of the Gulf of Santones, equally along the coastline, in the deep estuaries, and all around the islands (notably the √éle d'Albe).Commune of Muron The salt sites were quickly abandoned after the Roman conquest, because the new colonists brought with them a better-performing and more-productive technique for producing salt. Nevertheless, the Romans preferred to have their first salt marshes in the south, notably at Marennes, and on the banks of the Seudre River. Salt production, which before had been driven by profit, could be done faster around the Gironde,where the great port of lies which became an important arterial river for the transport of goods to and from the southern provinces of the Roman Empire. During the first three centuries of the Gallo- Roman period, the Romans were especially keen to colonise the area between the coastline of Aunis and the ancient sylve d'Argenson (\\"Forest of Argenson\\"), taking lands latterly in Santone hands. The new colonists, somewhat turning their backs to the sea, set up their ‚Äì large farms of some dozens of acres, predating the towns themselves ‚Äì at Ardilli√®res, Le Thou, Ballon, and Thair√©. All these sites left numerous archaeological finds: at Ballon, the remains of a Gallo-Roman villa have been found; at Ardilli√®res, tombs with Gallo-Roman objects have been recovered; at Thou, a Gallo-Roman villa and some coins were discovered in the 19th century. (See especially the \\"Map of Gallo-Roman occupation\\", p. 77.) However, near the end of the 3rd century AD, the entered a new age of prosperity, and its northern part was just as prosperous, after it was integrated into Aquitaine.\\"In 285 AD, during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, who made the provinces smaller to improve defence logistics, the became part of Aquitaine which was itself divided into six cities\\". The Romans also had interests in the \\"Pays des Aulnes\\" and had started to clear the Forest of Argenson on its eastern border. During the 1st century AD they had built the Roman road connecting (Saintes) to (Angers) but it passed Aunis by, so clearings were opened into this vast forest, notably at Vouh√©. Here remains of a Gallo-Roman villa have been restored, together with many fragmentary finds. At Saint-Georges-du-Bois, previously Argenton,The Forest of Argenson is recorded as Argen√ßon and Argenton, and others. Argenton was for a time the name of the commune now called Saint-Georges-du-Bois, north of the town of Surg√®res. This parish was called Argenton and its name is recorded in a charter of 1179, and the name was also used for the ancient forest. See the Romans built a small amphitheatre.This rural amphitheatre was discovered by aerial photography. In the 4th century AD the Romans decided to clear the Forest of Argenson along the southern shores of the Gulf of Pictones, which had been occupied by Celts since ancient times. The present Forest of Benon is in this area, where the Romans also established , whose names still linger on, such as that of the Gallo-Roman site in the commune of Saint-Ouen-d'Aunis.,On the site of Breuil-Bertin there are some Roman remains. or the old ‚Äì nowadays the commune of Nuaill√©-d'Aunis,This typical Gallo-Roman name means \\"The newly deforested lands\\". or indeed that of at Saint-Sauveur-d'Aunis.The site was later used for a monastery. The church of Notre-Dame at Surg√®res These attempts at deforestation and colonisation did succeed, albeit belatedly, but came to a halt with the invasions of the 5th century AD. So, the \\"barbarous\\" peopleA term used by the Romans to refer to anyone outside the Empire's borders; here it means the invaders of Gaul sealed the fall of the western Roman Empire,The date generally given by historians for this is 476 AD; see with pillage and destruction from which Santonie did not escape. The province was then occupied by the Visigoths from the start of the 5th century AD, and then by the Franks, who took over after their victory in Vouill√© in 507 AD. =The \\"pagus alnensis\\" in the Middle Ages= Aunis was once again neglected throughout the Middle Ages, \\"ignoring\\" the barbarians who had, after all, appropriated the great Roman roads during their invasions. From the time the Franks settled in the 6th century to the Carolingian dynasty in the 9th power in the province was unstable and autarchic.Records relating to this time in Aunis are very rare, and so is archaeology, which goes to show the complete isolation of Aunis at this time It was under Carolingian rule that Saintonge truly entered recorded history. Its name, , appears for the first time in 785. It was under the control of the Counts of Poitou. Towards the end of the 10th century, after Carolingian power collapsed, Aunis separated from Saintonge and had its first capital, Ch√¢telaillon. In the 9th and 10th centuries the Counts of Poitou hastened to fortify the Aunis coast. They built the four-tower fortress at Ch√¢telaillon as their strongholdThis defensive site gained repute for its fortress named \\"Lisleau\\". to deal with the Viking threat. But repeated Norman incursions into the interior, reached by river and stream, caused great insecurity. So in the 9th century the Duke of Poitou built the fortified city of Surg√®res, also called the of Benon, with \\"a tower that stood in the middle of a square, encircled by two paths and three moats\\". At the end of the 11th century, the Counts of Poitou started to pay attention to the forsaken backwaters of the region, and made them a priority. Above all, they encouraged powerful abbeys to be founded after clearing the Forest of Argenson. () Abbey was built in Benon, being the first Cistercian abbey to be founded in Aunis, and an active participant in the forest clearing movement. The clearings opened the way into the ancient forest to set up villages and farming (wheat, oats, barley) and to plant vines. The powerful monasteries, backed up by the lords, helped with the clearings of Aunis in the 11th century. But it is mostly during the 12th and 13th centuries that these earthworks were completed; much later that they became the \\"plain\\" of Aunis. On the coast, the salt waters had become amenable and created Aunis's wealth, and by the end of the 11th century its prosperity was assured. Ch√¢telaillon rapidly became the largest fortified city in Aunis and an important port for the transport of salt from Aunis, and wine from Saintonge. After the demise of Ch√¢telaillon in 1130, La Rochelle quickly rose to prominence and became the new capital of Aunis: \\"The demise of Ch√¢telaillon dates to 1130, but it was only in 1144 that Alon family control was removed. A party assembled at Maul√©on, the nearest island to Aunis, and they built the new town of La Rochelle there starting in 1151\\". The province was thus controlled in 1130 by William X, Duke of Aquitaine, bringing the dowry of Eleanor of Aquitaine to Louis VII of France, then, after their divorce and her remarriage, to King Henry II of England. Aunis was returned to the French with Louis VIII of France in 1224, but was restored by the Treaty of Brittany in 1360 by John II of France. This yoke was shaken off in 1371, and the province restored to King Charles V of France. = Birth of the province = The Vauban defensive wall in Saint-Martin-de-R√© In 1374 the King officially separated Saintonge in 1374 and set up Aunis: \\"In 1374, Charles V separated La Rochelle from Saintonge to set up a provincial government, comprising the jurisdictions of Rochefort, Marennes and, for a time, Benon. It was thus that Aunis legally became a separate province.\\" The province was much larger in mediaeval times, and underwent numerous changes to its borders. It extended from the Marais Poitevin in the north, to the lower valley of the Charente River in the south; to the west, it included the islands of √éle de R√© and the √éle d'Aix, at the mouth of the Charente. However, in the east the borders were often ill-defined and subject to change. It is likely that Aunis extended to the ports of Niort and also included the of Saint-Jean d'Ang√©ly. With the official establishment of the province in 1374, during the reign of Charles V of France, Aunis recovered Rochefort and Marennes, but its eastern boundaries were still vague. = During the Reformation = The Protestant Reformation, started in the time of Francis I of France, gave Aunis much greater power: it was the last stand of the resistance movement, which survived until La Rochelle fell in 1628. = End of the Ancien R√©gime = When the were established under the French Constitution of 1791, Aunis was a very small province both in area and population. Despite the resistance of its inhabitants and the energetic interventions of its leaders, in 1790 it was coalesced with the much larger region of Saintonge to form the Department of Charente-Maritime.From its creation in 1790 until 1941, the department was named because it was at the downstream end of the Charente River; the neighbouring Department of Charente was farther upstream and so called  Quote   Places of interest  The entrance of the Old Port of La Rochelle In La Rochelle: * The Saint Nicolas Tower, The Chain Tower, Lantern Tower (La Rochelle, France). * La Rochelle Town Hall, in the Renaissance style.

The hyphen in the newspaper's name first disappeared from the masthead in the early 1960s and was gone for good by 1974. The paper originally was a weekly publication but added editions through the years until reaching a four-days-a-week printing schedule by the 1980s. The CW ceased printing four days a week on August 24, 2015, opting instead to print a twice-weekly newspaper with a more graphically-focused newsmagazine style. The Crimson White's first known female editor was Barbara Hodge in 1942-43. At least 20 women have held the paper's top job since then. The newspaper's first black editor was Joseph Bryant, who served in 2000-01.

The Squamscott runs north between Newfields and Stratham to Great Bay, a tidal estuary, which is connected to the Piscataqua River, a tidal inlet of the Atlantic Ocean. More specifically, after rising at the Great Bridge (actually a very modest Works Progress Administration project) adjacent to the former \\"Loaf & Ladle\\" restaurant in downtown Exeter, the Squamscott River passes the \\"Wooden Wave\\" (an interesting architectural statement next to the Phillips Exeter Academy boathouse), then tends north alongside the Swasey Parkway, through the haymarshes, passing by the town's water purification plant and then under State Route 101, a major east‚Äìwest arterial road in New Hampshire. The river next passes under Route 108 at the site of the former \\"Singing Bridge\\", a metal bridge which was recently replaced. The river then debouches into Great Bay, a broad and shallow tidal estuary, just south of the mouth of the Lamprey River, arriving at the bay from Newmarket. The Squamscott, also spelled Swampscott and Swamscott, gets its name from the Squamscott Indians who called it Msquam-s-kook (or Msquamskek) translated as 'at the salmon place' or 'big water place.' Plentiful game, the marshes and lush river-fed vegetation, and an abundance of fish supported the northeast Native American Indians who were present in the region for thousands of years until English settlers displaced them in the early 17th century. The Native American tribes of New Hampshire were most likely from the Abenaki nation, but independent of the Maine-based tribes.

Known as a \\"gentle giant\\", his career lasted for 15 years (1983‚Äì1997) and his ability to protect quarterback Troy Aikman and to run-block for running back Emmitt Smith helped them win Super Bowls in 1992, 1993, and 1995 and the NFC East Division in 1985 and 1992-96. He was also selected for the Pro Bowl in 1994 and 1995. Early years Tuinei was born in Oceanside, California, raised in Nanakuli, Hawai'i and attended Punahou School in Honolulu. He was named the Hawaii Prep Lineman of the Year as a senior, won the state shot put championship and was an All-Star basketball player, while playing on the same team with Barack Obama. College career Tuinei played for two seasons at UCLA where he started at defensive tackle as a sophomore, finishing fifth on the team in tackles. The next year, he decided to drop out of the school before facing the possibility of being expelled after a fight incident. As a junior, he transferred back home to the University of Hawaii, but was suspended for the year, after being indicted on assault charges that led to spending three months in prison. He was nagged by injuries his senior year and played in only seven games, including 5 starts at defensive tackle. In 2007, he was inducted into the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was inducted into the Polynesian Hall of Fame. Professional career Although he was selected by the Boston Breakers in the 19th round (227th overall) of the 1983 USFL Draft, he opted to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Dallas Cowboys in 1983. He made the team as a backup defensive tackle. Considered one of the strongest players on the team, in his first two years he played mostly on special teams and short yardage situations, while being a backup at both defensive end and defensive tackle. In the 1985 preseason, the Cowboys offense needed help and like defensive tackles Blaine Nye and Pat Donovan before him, he was switched to play on the offensive line, backing up Tom Rafferty at center. In 1986, he worked at all three offensive line positions until settling at offensive tackle. However injuries to Kevin Brooks and Don Smerek early in the season, forced him to split time between the defensive and offensive lines. In the fifth week against the Denver Broncos, he led the defensive line with six tackles while replacing an injured Randy White. In the next game, he was named the starting left tackle against the Washington Redskins and remained there for the rest of the season. In 1987, he was progressing through his second season as the starting left tackle, when he sustained a left knee injury in the Thanksgiving game against the Minnesota Vikings, losing the last month on the injured reserve list. The next year he reinjured the same knee early in the season, but still saw action in 5 games before being put on injured reserve. In 1989, he didn't miss a play in a game or a practice. In 1990, during a season that experienced a number of players being juggled around the offensive line, Tuinei remained a solid foundation at left tackle, by starting all 13 games he played, and missing 3 contests with a sprained right knee he suffered against the New York Jets. In 1991, he suffered a groin injury that forced him to miss 4 games, returning to the starting lineup against the Houston Oilers, to help Emmitt Smith lead the NFL in rushing. In 1992, he started the first 5 games, but injured his back lifting weights in the week leading up to the Kansas City Chiefs contest. He was forced to sit out the game, but was able to return against the Los Angeles Raiders, contributing to Smith earning his second consecutive NFL rushing championship. In 1994, he suffered back spasms in the first quarter against the Washington Redskins, that required him to spend 2 nights in the hospital and miss the Arizona Cardinals game. He returned to the starting lineup against the Philadelphia Eagles. He helped the offensive line establish a new franchise record by allowing 20 sacks in a season, while being elected for his first Pro Bowl. In 1995, he contributed to Smith winning his fourth rushing title, score an NFL record 25 rushing touchdowns and gain a club record 1,773 rushing yards. He received his second selection to the Pro Bowl, as part of a line that broke the team record by allowing just 18 sacks in a season. The next year suffered a torn medial collateral ligament in his right knee in a preseason game against the New England Patriots, which eventually required offseason surgery. Despite the injury, he contributed to the offensive line leading the league in allowing the fewest sacks with 19. He missed playing time against the Atlanta Falcons after re-aggravating his injury in the first quarter. He only sat out the season finale against the Washington Redskins and returned for the playoffs. Knee problems ended his career after the 1997 season, when Larry Allen took over for him at left tackle. \\"We just all loved the guy,\\" said former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach. \\"He was just a gentle giant. He was just one of those unsung players that goes out and does their job. He was one of those kind of players every team needs. He was a role model for the NFL.\\" He suffered knee injuries most of his career, yet he would play a total of 195 games, more than any other Cowboys offensive player ever. He also helped to protect Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman and pave the way for Hall of Fame running back Smith to become the NFL all-time leading rusher. Tuinei was a key member of the Cowboys offensive line, helping the team win Super Bowl XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX, along with the NFC East Division in 1985 and from 1992 to 1996. His role in some of the greatest offensive lines in NFL history was detailed in the 2013 NFL Network's film A Football Life: \\"the Great Wall of Dallas\\". On April 14, 1998, he was released in a salary-cap move, finishing tied with Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones and Bill Bates for the most seasons in a Cowboy uniform‚Äîwith 15. He is considered to be one of the greatest offensive tackles in Cowboys franchise history. Death In May 1999, Tuinei was found unconscious in his antique Ford car, and he was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital in the Dallas suburb of Plano. He had been planning to return to Punahou School as offensive line coach. The autopsy revealed that Tuinei died of a combination of heroin and a form of the drug ecstasy. His death was ruled an accidental overdose. Upon the release of the autopsy results, Plano police chief Bruce Glasscock was quoted as saying that it was Tuinei's first experience with heroin. \\"What you had was a 39-year-old male, 6'5\\", in excess of 300 pounds, a healthy individual, took one shot of heroin and basically dropped dead as a result,\\" Glasscock said during his press conference regarding Tuinei. Tuinei got the heroin from four people who belonged to a drug ring. The four men were charged, tried and convicted for conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine. Jesus Carbajal received a life sentence. Julian Solis Perez and Andres Milan were sentenced to eleven-year prison terms, and Favian Ramos received a twelve-year sentence.

Such a Ruthenian duchy, as proposed in the 1658 Treaty of Hadiach, would have been a full-fledged member of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which would thereby have become a tripartite Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìRuthenian Commonwealth.

The Russian historian Tairova-Yakovleva regards the resistance of Polish society and papal pressure as the reasons for the incomplete ratification. The idea of a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìRuthenian Commonwealth revived during the January Uprising when a patriotic demonstration took place at Horod≈Ço in 1861. The so-called Second Union of Horod≈Ço was announced there, by the szlachta of Congress Poland, of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, of Volhynia and of Podolia. New Poland, based on the Second Union of Horod≈Ço, was to be based on the three nations, and its proposed coat of arms included the Polish eagle, the Lithuanian Pahonia, and the patron saint of Ruthenia, the Archangel Michael.

From the beginning, the magazine was devoted to the coverage of chess worldwide, and not just in Great Britain. BCM is an independent and privately owned magazine; it is not owned or run by the former British Chess Federation (now the English Chess Federation), with which its name was occasionally confused, apart from the period August 1981 ‚Äì July 1992.

In Karnataka, silk is mainly produced in the Mysore district. It is a patent registered product under KSIC. KSIC is an owner of the Mysore Silk brand. History The growth of the silk industry in the Kingdom of Mysore was first initiated during the reign of Tipu Sultan nearly 1780-1790AC. Later it was hit by a global depression, and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India. About Mysore silk is produced by the Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation Limited (KSIC). The factory was founded in 1912 by Sri Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, the Maharaja of Mysore. Initially, the silk fabrics were manufactured & supplied to meet the requirements of the royal family and ornamental fabrics to their armed forces. After India gained independence, the Mysore State Sericulture Dept. took control of the silk weaving factory. In 1980, the factory was handed over to KSIC, a government of Karnataka industry. Today, products include silk sarees, shirts, kurta's, silk dhoti, and neckties. Mysore silk has also received geographical identification.http://www.ipindia.nic.in/writereaddata/Portal/IPOJournal/1_317_1/Journal_86.pdf Process Mysore Silk factory located in the heart of Mysore is spread across acres of land and is mainly responsible for silk weaving and distribution of silk products. The main source of silk for this factory is from the Ramanagara district in Karnataka which is also the is the largest market for silk cocoons in Asia.Ramanagara Farmers from various parts of this district market the silk cocoons in this place everyday. Silk cocoons are hand picked at this market from KSIC officials who have an expertise in Mysore silk everyday as part of government bidding process and are sent to the raw silk production factory located in T.Narasipura. At this factory, the silk cocoons are boiled to extract threads and converted into thread rolls which are sent to the weaving factory located in Mysore. These threads are used to produce various silk products among which Mysore silk saree is the most popular. Since the saree zari contains 65% pure silver and 0.65% of gold, it is also one of the most expensive silk saree in India.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mysore-silk-saris- get-a-kasuti-makeover/articleshow/70563100.cms This has led to production of duplicate Mysore silk saree production and sales by cheating the public in the name of KSIC. To avoid these issues, KSIC has implemented unique id, hologram based design and unique identification barcode weaven on each Mysore Silk saree produced in its factory.

Fern√£o Lopes wrote the history of Portugal, but only a part of his work remained. His way of writing was based on oral discourse, and, on every page, it revealed his roots among the common people. He is one of the fathers of the European historiography, or a precursor of the scientific historiography, basing his works always on the documental proof, and, as he said, on his pages \\"one cannot find the beauty of words but the nudity of the truth.\\" He was an autodidact. By the time of his death, a new kind of knowledge was arising, a Latinized scholasticism that involved imitations of the classics. He was born sometime between 1380 and 1390, and he belonged to the generation that came of age after the war with Castile and the Battle of Aljubarrota. During his life, he knew many of the protagonists of the Castilian crisis, including John I of Portugal, Edward of Portugal, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, and Dr. Jo√£o das Regras. He saw the reign of three monarchs: John I, Edward I, and Afonso V, and he also lived during the regency of Peter, Duke of Coimbra. Portugal saw many social and political changes in his time, such as: the growth of the new nobility of the 'Illustrious Generation' (√çnclita Gera√ß√£o) (the children of John I and Philippa of Lancaster); the conquest of Ceuta; the insurrection of Lisbon against the Queen Mother, Leonor of Aragon; the election of Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, to the regency; a civil war between Pedro and Afonso V; and the subsequent Battle of Alfarrobeira, where Pedro died. At the end of his life, Lopes witnessed the beginning of Portugal's maritime empire. In 1418, Fern√£o Lopes was appointed by John I as the head (guardi√£o-mor) of the royal archives ('Torre do Tombo'). In 1434, King Edward appointed Fern√£o Lopes as the first royal chronicler (cronista- mor) of the realm, and commissioned him to write historical accounts of the reigns of the Kings of Portugal. Lopes threw himself into the task. Fern√£o Lopes is acknowledged as the author of at least three chronicles: of the reign of king Peter I (r.1357-1367), of the reign of Ferdinand I (r.1367-1385) and the first two parts of the reign of John I (1385 up to year 1412, his successor Gomes Eanes de Zurara would produce the third and final part). Fern√£o Lopes is believed by some modern historians to also be the author of an anonymous history of the constable Nuno √Ålvares Pereira and, more contentiously, of a summary chronicle of the first several kings of Portugal (of which two drafts exist ‚Äî one of the first five kings (Porto MS), another of the first seven (Cadaval or '1419' MS).Magalh√£es Basto (1959) Fern√£o Lopes held his official positions until around 1454, when he was forced to retire on account of his advanced age, and was succeeded by Gomes Eanes de Zurara. Lopes died sometime after 1459. It has been controversially alleged by some historians (starting with Dami√£o de G√≥isDami√£o de G√≥is, 1566-67, Cr√≥nica do Felic√≠ssimo Rei D. Manuel, pt.4, ch.38, esp. p.522) that later 16th-century chroniclers Duarte Galv√£o and Ruy de Pina composed their chronicles of the remaining reigns from draft manuscripts left behind by Fern√£o Lopes ‚Äî not merely drawing upon them, but plagiarizing them in whole or in part, to the point that Fern√£o Lopes is sometimes credited as their joint author. While there is some evidence that Galv√£o's chronicle of Afonso I might have copied parts from Lopes's manuscripts, historians generally agree that the accusation against Ruy de Pina is largely unmerited and unjust.Magalh√£es Basto (1959) Works Uncontested (written by Fern√£o Lopes in 1430s & 1440s; original manuscripts lost; first published in 17th and 18th centuries on the basis of draft copies produced in the early 16th century.) *(\\"Chronicle of king Peter I\\") Cr√≥nica de el-rei D.

History  The Presbyterian Church in Mozambique was started by Mozambicans, who heard the gospel in South Africa. Yosefa Mhalamhala converted to the Reformed faith, and went back to Mozambique in 1880. In 1882 an African church was born. In 1887 the Swiss missionaries joined the African Church and founded the Swiss Mission. Since then it was known as simply the Swiss mission. It has established schools, hospitals and agricultural settings. In 1948 it became independent. It is a Presbyterian church. The denomination was founded by Swiss missionaries especially Paul Bertaud. In the early years the church operated in the provinces of Maputo and Gaza but today it spread across the country.

He served as the eleventh Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1869 and 1870, and then represented Texas in the United States Senate from 1870 to 1875. Early life James was born to Charles and Elizabeth (Saunders) Flanagan in Albemarle County near Gordonsville, Virginia. Before his tenth birthday, the family moved to Boonesboro, Kentucky. As a young man he moved to Cloverport, Kentucky, on the Ohio River and became a prosperous merchant. He also read law and was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1825. He married Polly Moorman in 1826 and the couple had several children before moving to Henderson, Texas, in 1844. Career Flanagan established himself in Henderson by opening a store. He bought a farm, speculated in land, and practiced law. Politically, he was a Whig and an active supporter of Sam Houston. He later became a moderate Republican. Flanagan served in the Texas House of Representatives (1851-1852) and the Texas State Senate (1855-1858). When the Civil War came to Texas, Flanagan was a Unionist, but he withdrew to his farm and lived quietly. He returned to active politics during the Reconstruction. He served as a delegate to both Constitutional Conventions. The first, in 1866, produced a state constitution that was rejected by the Radical Republicans in the U.S. Congress. The second, in 1868-1869, was successful. Under the new Constitution, Flanagan was elected Lieutenant Governor. He served there only until 1870, when Texas was readmitted to the Union. The legislature named him, along with Morgan Hamilton, to the U.S. Senate. He served one term as a Senator, until 1875 when he was replaced by the Democrat Samuel Maxey. In the Senate he was a supporter of the Grant Administration. Later life After his Senate term, Flanagan took up residence on one of his farms near Longview, Texas. He married again (he was widowed twice and married three times), this time to Elizabeth Lane. The three marriages produced a total of eleven children. One of Flanagan‚Äôs children was David Webster Flanagan who also served as Lieutenant Governor in Texas. Flanagan died on his farm in Longview in 1887 and was buried next to his first wife, Polly, in their family graveyard in Henderson, Texas.

They were renowned for long-range accuracy. By 1874 the rifle was available in a variety of calibers, and it was one of the few designs to successfully transition to metallic cartridge use. The Sharps rifles became icons of the American Old West due to their appearances in many Western-genre movies and books. Perhaps as a result, a number of different rifle companies currently offer reproductions of the Sharps rifle. History Sharps' initial rifle was patented September 12, 1848IMPROVEMENT IN BREECH-LOADING FIRE-ARMS retrieved 20 September 2008 from Google. and manufactured by A. S. Nippes at Mill Creek, (Philadelphia) Pennsylvania, in 1850. The second model used the Maynard tape primer, and surviving examples are marked Edward Maynard - Patentee 1845. In 1851 the second model was brought to the Robbins & Lawrence Company of Windsor, Vermont where the Model 1851 was developed for mass production. Rollin White of the R&L; Co. invented the knife-edge breech block and self- cocking device for the \\"box-lock\\" Model 1851. This is referred to as the \\"First Contract\\", which was for 10,000 Model 1851 carbines - of which approximately 1,650 were produced by R&L; in Windsor. In 1851 the \\"Second Contract\\" was made for 15,000 rifles and the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company was organized as a holding company with $1,000 in capital and with John C. Palmer as president, Christian Sharps as engineer, and Richard S. Lawrence as master armorer and superintendent of manufacturing. Sharps was to be paid a royalty of $1 per firearm and the factory was built on R&L;'s property in Hartford, Connecticut. The Model 1851 was replaced in production by the Model 1853. Christian Sharps left the company in 1855 to form his own manufacturing company called \\"C. Sharps & Company\\" in Philadelphia; Richard S. Lawrence continued as the chief armorer until 1872 and developed the various Sharp models and their improvements that made the rifle famous. In 1874, the company was reorganized and renamed \\"The Sharps Rifle Company\\" and it remained in Hartford until 1876, whereupon it relocated to Bridgeport, Connecticut. The Sharps rifle would play a prominent role in the Bleeding Kansas conflict during the 1850s, particularly in the hands of anti-slavery forces. The Sharps rifles supplied to anti-slavery factions earned the name Beecher's Bibles, after the famed abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher. The 1874-pattern Sharps was a particularly popular rifle that led to the introduction of several derivatives in quick succession. It handled a large number of .40- to .50-caliber cartridges in a variety of loadings and barrel lengths. Hugo Borchardt designed the Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878, the last rifle made by the Sharps Rifle Co. before its closing in 1881. Reproductions of the paper cartridge Sharps M1859 and M1863 Rifle and Carbine, the metallic cartridge 1874 Sharps Rifle, and Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878 are being manufactured today. They are used in Civil War re-enacting, hunting and target shooting. Sharps military rifles and carbines Sharps Model 1852 \\"Slanting Breech\\" Carbine, open for loading, two primer-tapes The military Sharps rifle was a falling block rifle used during and after the American Civil War in multiple variations. Along with being able to use a standard percussion cap, the Sharps had a fairly unusual pellet primer feed. This was a device which held a stack of pelleted primers and flipped one over the nipple each time the trigger was pulled and the hammer fell‚Äîmaking it much easier to fire a Sharps from horseback than a gun employing individually loaded percussion caps. The Sharps Rifle was produced by the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut. It was used in the Civil War by multiple Union units, most famously by the U.S. Army marksmen known popularly as \\"Berdan's Sharpshooters\\" in honor of their leader Hiram Berdan. The Sharps made a superior sniper weapon of greater accuracy than the more commonly issued muzzle-loading rifled muskets. This was due mainly to the higher rate of fire of the breech loading mechanism and superior quality of manufacture, as well as the ease of which it could be reloaded from a kneeling or prone position. At this time however, many officers were distrustful of breech-loading weapons on the grounds that they would encourage men to waste ammunition. In addition, the Sharps rifle was expensive to manufacture (three times the cost of a muzzle-loading Springfield rifle) and so only 11,000 of the Model 1859s were produced. Most were unissued or given to sharpshooters, but the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves (which still carried the old-fashioned designation of a \\"rifle regiment\\") carried them until being mustered out in 1864. =Sharps military carbine= Original 1863 carbine in .50-70 Government. The carbine version was very popular with the cavalry of both the Union and Confederate armies and was issued in much larger numbers than other carbines of the war and was top in production in front of the Spencer or Burnside carbine. The falling block action lent itself to conversion to the new metallic cartridges developed in the late 1860s, and many of these converted carbines in .50-70 Government were used during the Indian Wars in the decades immediately following the Civil War. Some Civil War‚Äìissue carbines had an unusual feature: a hand-cranked grinder in the stock. Although long thought to be a coffee mill, experimentation with some of the few survivors suggests the grinder is ill-suited for coffee. The modern consensus is that its true purpose was for grinding corn or wheat. Unlike the Sharps rifle, the carbine was very popular and almost 90,000 were produced. By 1863, it was the most common weapon carried by Union cavalry regiments, although in 1864 many were replaced by 7-shot Spencer carbines. Some Sharps clones were produced by the Confederates in Richmond. Quality was generally poorer and they normally used brass fittings instead of iron. Alfred Waud painting showing men of the 1st Maine Cavalry with Sharps carbines during the battle of Middleburg. The kneeling man fires at the enemy, as the man standing behind him is feeding a new cartridge into the chamber. The British purchased 1,000 Model 1852 carbines in 1855 which was later used in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. https://www.historynet.com/the-sharps-carbine-became-a-yankee- breechloader-in-redcoat-dress.htm Sharps sporting rifles Sharps made sporting versions from the late 1840s until the late 1880s. After the American Civil War, converted Army surplus rifles were made into custom firearms, and the Sharps factory produced Models 1869 and 1874 in large numbers for commercial buffalo hunters and frontiersmen. These large-bore rifles were manufactured with some of the most powerful black powder cartridges ever made. Sharps also fabricated special long-range target versions for the then-popular Creedmoor style of target shooting. Many modern black powder cartridge silhouette shooters use original and replica Sharps rifles to target metallic silhouettes cut in the shapes of animals at ranges up to 500 meters. Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company, and C Sharps Arms of Big Timber, Montana, have been manufacturing reproductions of the Sharps Rifle since 1983 and 1979, respectively. Cultural significance In the 1990 western Quigley Down Under, Tom Selleck's title character uses a Sharps rifle chambered in the .45-110 caliber. Theater Crafts Industry went so far as to say, \\"In Quigley Down Under, which we did in 1990, the Sharps rifle practically co-stars with Tom Selleck.\\"TCI: the business of entertainment technology & design, Volume 29(1995) This statement was echoed by gunwriters including John Taffin in Guns and Lionel Atwill in Field & Stream, crediting the film with an impact to rival that of Dirty Harry on the Smith & Wesson Model 29. Burt Lancaster's character Valdez in the movie Valdez Is Coming (1971) uses a Sharps rifle with deadly results at almost 1,000 yards. Also, in the western Billy Two Hats (1974), David Huddleston's character Copeland wounds Gregory Peck's character, Archie Deans, at a far distance. Firearms manufacturers such as Davide Pedersoli and Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company have credited these movies with an increase in demand for those rifles. As a result of the popularity of the film, a Sharps match is held annually in Forsyth, Montana known as the \\"Matthew Quigley Buffalo Rifle Match\\". Originally a 44-inch target was placed at 1,000 yards for each shooter, remniscent of a scene from the movie. The match is billed as the \\"biggest rifle event shooting in Eastern Montana since the Custer Massacre\\" and has since developed into a two-day competition with eight shots for score on six steel silhouette targets at ranges from 350 to 805 yards. On television, a Sharps plays a central role in the murder investigation in the pilot of Longmire. A Sharps is the weapon used in the murder, and its firing action is central to the climactic sequence. On movies, the rifle is shown in 2010 movie True Grit. In addition, the 2009 film Up, the mad explorer Charles Muntz is seen wielding a Shiloh Sharps reminiscent of Matthew Quigley's Sharps from Quigley Down Under.

The line served as a long-distance passenger and freight line between Philadelphia, Reading, and Harrisburg, nearly paralleling the Philadelphia & Columbia Railroad ‚Äî later incorporated as the main east-west line of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Prior to 1976, the SVM line, which was electrified between Reading Terminal and Norristown in 1933, ran parallel to the PRR's Schuylkill Branch (which was also electrified to Norristown, in 1930 as part of the PRR's main electrification project), which connected Philadelphia, via the East-West Mainline, with Reading and Pottstown, Pennsylvania. The City of Philadelphia and suburban counties began providing public funds under contract with PRR and RDG for continuation and improvement of regional rail service. Because the Reading's Norristown line was considered the stronger of the two, PRR service was cut back to Manayunk in 1960. Conrail assumed operations in April 1976, resulting in all freight activity shifting to the SVM line. Commuter service on the former PRR line was extended from Manayunk to Ivy Ridge in order to serve a new park-and-ride lot, but was curtailed in 1986 to the Cynwyd station in Lower Merion Township. SVM service to Reading, which used electric multiple-unit cars between Reading Terminal and Norristown, and diesel-electric \\"push-pull\\" cars from Norristown to Reading, continued in operation until SEPTA ceased funding in 1981, two years prior to taking over all of the electrified Philadelphia area commuter rail service. Since its termination in 1981, the population shifted from Philadelphia itself out to the suburbs, with some residents commuting over 60 miles from Reading and its suburbs to Philadelphia on a daily basis. Although the completion of bypasses for U.S. Highway 422, U.S. Highway 202, and Interstate 76 allows travelers to reach Philadelphia without a traffic-control device, the increased number of automobiles has placed a strain on these three highways. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, under former Pennsylvania Governor Mark Schweiker, along with U.S. Congressman Jim Gerlach of the state's 6th Congressional district, have placed pressure on the federal government to give funding for the new SVM project. No concrete plans have been approved. In August 2006, Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell announced that funding for the SVM project would not be forthcoming and that it should be considered dead. In December 2007, Montgomery County authorized an unsuccessful study that looked at possible new funding sources. Congressman Jim Gerlach announced in April 2011 that the results from that Montgomery County study would be soon published. Physical description The new SVM system, while identical in many ways to the old SVM line from the Reading days, would be completely different in many aspects. First, the line would use both sides of the former SEPTA R6 lines; the former PRR Schuylkill Branch between Suburban Station and Ivy Ridge (Cynwyd Line), and the former Reading's main line between Jefferson Station and Norristown (Manayunk/Norristown Line), before merging on the old Reading Main Line (now Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line) west of the current Norristown station. A new spur, called the Cross- County Segment, would split off at Port Kennedy (near Valley Forge), and would allow SVM trains to access King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and the Great Valley Corporate Center in Malvern, Pennsylvania, using the former PRR/Penn Central Trenton Cutoff (now Norfolk Southern's Dale Secondary) used by the former PRR as a freight-only bypass around Philadelphia, although an alternative would be to have the Cross-County segment serve only King of Prussia with SEPTA extending the existing Norristown High-Speed Line to King of Prussia, via the Trenton Cutoff. Unlike the RDG trains, the new SVM would be entirely electric, with power being supplied by Amtrak, SEPTA, and (between Norristown and Reading) the Exelon Corporation, the successor company to the former Philadelphia Electric Company, later PECO Energy. Existing catenary wires, powered at 12 kV, 25 Hz AC, would be used on the old lines, with new high- tension catenary poles, powered at 25 kV, 60 Hz AC, and similar to the system utilized on the Northeast Corridor north of New Haven, Connecticut, would be employed west of Norristown. Stations SVM plans included stations currently used by SEPTA, along with new stations north of Norristown. As the SVM cars would only have motormen, and to allow compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, all existing and new stations would be built with high- level platforms. The stations are as follows: SVM Main Line (Philadelphia- Reading) * Jefferson Station * Suburban Station * 30th Street Station * 52nd Street * Wynnefield * Bala * Cynwyd * Manayunk (upper) * Ivy Ridge (upper) * Conshohocken * Norristown Transportation Center * Port Kennedy (lower) * Phoenixville * Royersford * Limerick (Township) * Pottstown * Exeter (Township) * Reading * VF Factory Outlet SVM Cross-County Segment (Philadelphia-Great Valley) * 30th Street Station * Suburban Station * Jefferson Station * Temple University * North Broad Street * Allegheny * Manayunk (lower) * Ivy Ridge (lower) * Miquon * Conshohoken * Norristown Transportation Center * Port Kennedy (upper) * King of Prussia (at Court & Plaza mall complexes) * Cassett Road * Great Valley (near Great Valley Corporate Center) * Glenloch (near Exton) Planners intended to operate trains at 15-minute intervals during peak travel times, Mondays to Fridays, and at 30-minute intervals at all other times. Norfolk Southern Railway trains would have been able to use most of the system at all hours, but would have been restricted to overnight movements at some locations after SVM ceased operations at night between Midnight and 6 a.m. Succession =Norristown Extension= After the plan was rejected by FTA, the Montgomery County Planning Commission initiated the R6 Extension Study (later called the Norristown Extension) as an alternative approach. Unlike the SVM, the R6 Extension Study would only see electrification extended as far as King of Prussia (with SEPTA extending the Norristown High Speed Service) and no major reconstruction of any platforms. Any service west of King of Prussia would require new construction and the purchasing of extra push-pull consists hauled by dual-mode locomotives. Funding for the R6 Extension Study was to be provided by revenue earned via a proposed plan to toll U.S. Route 422 between Pottstown and King of Prussia. The tolling idea, suggested by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), was lambasted by several regional politicians, most notably Pennsylvania House of Representatives member Mike Vereb. Vereb and the influential passenger rail advocacy group Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition jointly appeared at a DVRPC open forum on September 13, 2011 where DVRPC Executive Director Barry Seymour was presenting.PA-TEC 422 Corridor Transportation Improvements ProposalPA-TEC news: Sept 2011 On October 5, 2011, under increasing pressure and opposition, DVRPC cancelled the tolling proposal and plans for the Norristown Extension. In mid-2018, the borough of Phoenixville began a study to restore SEPTA passenger rail service between Norristown and Phoenixville along Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks. In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing. The proposed extension would utilize existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks. Before service can be implemented, a study would need to take place. =Greenline= Another alternate approach, known as the Greenline, proposed to serve the towns of Oaks and Phoenixville via a new connection at the current Paoli/Thorndale Line at Paoli Station.

If spun in the opposite direction, it becomes unstable, \\"rattles\\" to a stop and reverses its spin to the preferred direction. This spin-reversal appears to violate the law of the conservation of angular momentum. Moreover, for most rattlebacks the motion will happen when the rattleback is spun in one direction, but not when spun in the other. Some exceptional rattlebacks will reverse when spun in either direction. This makes the rattleback a physical curiosity that has excited human imagination since prehistoric times.\\"celt, n.2\\". OED Online. September 2012.

History Large rattleback made from different wood densities Archeologists who investigated ancient Celtic and Egyptian sites in the 19th century found celts which exhibited the spin-reversal motion. The antiquarian word \\"celt\\" (the \\"c\\" is pronounced as \\"s\\") describes adze-, axe-, chisel- and hoe-shaped lithic tools and weapons. The first modern descriptions of these celts were published in the 1890s when Gilbert Walker wrote his \\"On a curious dynamical property of celts\\" for the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in Cambridge, England, and \\"On a dynamical top\\" for the Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics in Somerville, Massachusetts, US. Additional examinations of rattlebacks were published in 1909 and 1918, and by the 1950s and 1970s, several more examinations were made. But, the popular fascination with the objects has increased notably since the 1980s when no fewer than 28 examinations were published. Size and materials Carved wooden rattleback While rattleback artifacts are described as stone with various measurements, most which are sold currently as novelty puzzles and toys are described as plastic with measurements of 3.75 inches long x 0.75 inches wide x 0.4375 inches high. Carved wooden rattlebacks are described with a measurement of 5.5 to 6 inches in length. One plastic rattleback made and sold by Charles W. Sherburne is described as 12 inches in length. Glass rattlebacks, and those made of spoons, http://www.exo.net/~pauld/TomTits2000/europetrip/technorama%20lecture/technoramalecture.html are described as being tested with unreported measurements. Larger rattlebacks (up to 8 feet long and 16 inches wide) are made on request by Emmanuel Peluchon for science museums. Two rattleback design types exist. They have either an asymmetrical base with a skewed rolling axis, or a symmetrical base with offset weighting at the ends. Physics left The spin-reversal motion follows from the growth of instabilities on the other rotation axes, that are rolling (on the main axis) and pitching (on the crosswise axis). Rattleback made with spoon exhibiting multiple spin reversals. Original video and idea by Prof. Christian Ucke. When there is an asymmetry in the mass distribution with respect to the plane formed by the pitching and the vertical axes, a coupling of these two instabilities arises; one can imagine how the asymmetry in mass will deviate the rattleback when pitching, which will create some rolling. The amplified mode will differ depending on the spin direction, which explains the rattleback's asymmetrical behavior. Depending on whether it is rather a pitching or rolling instability that dominates, the growth rate will be very high or quite low. This explains why, due to friction, most rattlebacks appear to exhibit spin-reversal motion only when spun in the pitching-unstable direction, also known as the strong reversal direction. When the rattleback is spun in the \\"stable direction\\", also known as the weak reversal direction, friction and damping often slow the rattleback to a stop before the rolling instability has time to fully build. Some rattlebacks, however, exhibit \\"unstable behavior\\" when spun in either direction, and incur several successive spin reversals per spin. Other ways to add motion to a rattleback include tapping by pressing down momentarily on either of its ends, and rocking by pressing down repeatedly on either of its ends. For a comprehensive analysis of rattleback's motion, see V.Ph. Zhuravlev and D.M. Klimov (2008).V.Ph. Zhuravlev and D.M. Klimov, Global motion of the celt, Mechanics of Solids, 2008, Vol. 43, No. 3, pp. 320-327. The previous papers were based on simplified assumptions and limited to studying local instability of its steady-state oscillation. Realistic mathematical modelling of a rattleback is presented by G. Kudra and J. Awrejcewicz (2015).G. Kudra, J. Awrejcewicz, Application and experimental validation of new computational models of friction forces and rolling resistance, Acta Mechanica, 2015 (DOI: 10.1007/s00707-015-1353-z). They focused on modelling of the contact forces and tested different versions of models of friction and rolling resistance, obtaining good agreement with the experimental results. Numerical simulations predict that a rattleback situated on a harmonically oscillating base can exhibit rich bifurcation dynamics, including different types of periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motions.J. Awrejcewicz, G. Kudra, Mathematical modelling and simulation of the bifurcational wobblestone dynamics, Discontinuity, Nonlinearity and Complexity, 3(2), 2014, 123-132.

History and profile Le Point was founded in September 1972 by a group of journalists who had, one year earlier, left the editorial team of L'Express, which was then owned by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a d√©put√© (member of parliament) of the Parti Radical, a centrist party. The company operating Le Point, Soci√©t√© d'exploitation de l'hebdomadaire Le Point (SEBDO Le Point) has its head office in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.\\"Mentions l√©gales.\\" Le Point. Retrieved 25 August 2011. \\"Si√®ge social: 74, avenue du Maine - 75682 Paris Cedex 14\\" The founders emphasize on readers' need and it became the aim of Le Point which is published weekly on Thursdays by Le Point Communication. After a fairly difficult start in September 1972, the magazine quickly challenged L'Express. The editorial team of spring 1972 found financial backing with group Hachette and was then directed by Claude Imbert. Other journalists making up the team were: Jacques Duquesne, Henri Trinchet, Pierre Billard, Robert Franc, Georges Suffert. The management included Olivier Chevrillon, Pdg and Philippe Ramond. It has changed ownership several times. Gaumont cinema group bought the magazine in 1981. In 1997 the magazine was acquired by its current owner Art√©mis, a French investment group founded and owned by the billionaire businessman Fran√ßois Pinault. In 2001 the logo and layout of Le Point was changed. The weekly recruited journalists from the Parisian press and relied on its ability to redefine the genre. It modeled itself closely on Time Magazine and Newsweek. Le Point has a conservative, center-right stance without any political affiliation. It publishes a list regarding the reputation of companies, Barom√®tre d‚ÄôImage des Grandes Entreprises. Circulation Le Point had a circulation of 336,000 copies in 1981. It was 311,000 copies in 1987 and 320,000 copies in 1988. In 2001 Le Point had a circulation of 303,000 copies. During the 2007-2008 period its circulation was 419,000 copies. In 2009 the circulation of the magazine was 435,000 copies. Its circulation in 2011 was 428,114 copies. The 2013 circulation of the magazine was 417,062 copies.

It rises in Barrington, flows southeast to Lee, then east-southeast in a serpentine course past Durham to meet the entrance of Great Bay into Little Bay. The bays are tidal inlets of the Atlantic Ocean, to which they are connected by a tidal estuary, the Piscataqua River. The freshwater portion of the river is long, and the tidal river extends from Durham to Great Bay. The Oyster River reaches tidewater at the base of a dam in the center of Durham, just west of the river's crossing by NH Route 108. Due to siltation, the river is only fully accessible to motorized boats west of the Durham Water Plant for approximately three hours on either side of high tide. Boaters have noticed the increasing effect of siltation on navigation since 1998. History The Oyster River valley, like the rest of New England, was entirely covered by ice during the last continental glaciation. Remnants from the Ice Age in the watershed include glacial erratics and kettle holes such as Spruce Hole Bog, south of the river in Durham. Ever since European settlers came to the Oyster River they have altered its flow and taken its resources. In the 1600s, before people had a major effect on the river, Great Bay, into which the Oyster River flows, was a port where sturdy oceangoing ships could anchor at a place called Durham Landing. But as time passed, settlers built dams and cleared the forests for farmland. As forests diminished, soil usually held in place by tree roots started to wash into the river, causing its waters to fill with silt. By the 1800s, oceangoing ships were unable to reach Durham Landing except at extremely high tides. Mill Pond Dam, as depicted on a 1908 postcard The Oyster River community was one of the three original Dover settlements, which also included Hilton Point and the current Durham town center. The population of this settlement is said to have peaked at around 300 people in the mid 17th century. However, the population was reduced in 1694 after a Native American raid, commonly known as the Oyster River Massacre or the Raid on Oyster River. In total around 94 inhabitants were either killed or taken hostage by the Native Americans under French command.http://www.seacoastnh.com/History/As-I- Please/Digging-into-the-Oyster-River-Massacre/ The river passes over Mill Pond Dam, which dates to 1913 and is listed on the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places, near NH Route 108 in Durham where the river reaches tidewater. Prior wooden dams provided power to sawmills and gristmills dating back to the mid-1600s. , the dam is being considered for removal, due to the cost of potential repair work and water quality issues with the Mill Pond that the dam creates. Water usage The Oyster River is a significant source of drinking water for the town of Durham and the University of New Hampshire.http://www.lefh.net/orwa/ORWAFactSheetFinalPrinted.pdf The extent to which the Oyster River can be used as a resource is being stretched more and more as the population increases within the area. Residential water usage in the area is expected to increase by 54% before the year 2025, and non-domestic usage, for example commercial, industrial, irrigation and mining, is expected to increase 62%.http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5157/ Thus, the Oyster River is going to become an even more essential resource to the community. Conservation issues The river crosses under heavily-traveled U.S. Route 4 in three separate places in the town of Lee and passes within of the busy Lee Traffic Circle, which poses an ecological threat if runoff from the road gets into the water. Along the river there remain stretches of untouched floodplain and forests that stretch on for almost . These floodplain areas are useful in holding excess water during severe weather and help to reduce the damage done to the infrastructure elsewhere along the river.http://www.lefh.net/orwa/ORWA_final_submission_05272010.pdf The floodplains also house diverse ecological communities and are home to many diverse species of New Hampshire. One species that has been greatly affected by the steady decline in the health of the Oyster River is the oyster itself. Due to siltation and water pollution in the river the population of oysters hit an all time low in 2000 at . However, the rate rebounded to just a couple years later.http://www.prep.unh.edu/resources/pdf/2009_state_of_the- prep-09.pdf Another species that lives in the Oyster river is the American Brook Lamprey (Lampetra appendix) which only exists in this river in the entire state. The river as a whole is home to seven fish species of concern.

Located 20 kilometers from the Danish capital, Copenhagen, the Danish government pressed for its closure during the entirety of its operating lifetime. As a result of a now former Swedish nuclear power phase-out, its two reactors have been closed down. The first reactor, Barseb√§ck 1, was closed November 30, 1999, and the second, Barseb√§ck 2, ceased operations May 31, 2005. At the time of closure, each reactor had a net capacity of 600 megawatts. Unit 1 supplied 93,8 TWh and unit 2 108 TWh to the electrical grid. Land for the plant was bought in 1965 by the energy company Sydkraft, and the first of the two BWR reactors was ordered from Asea-Atom in 1969. Unit one first attained criticality on January 18, 1975 and commercial operation began on May 15. The second reactor attained criticality on March 21, 1977 and commercial operation began on July 1. Following a decision in the Riksdag in 1997, the Government of Sweden decided that the first reactor was to close July 1, 1998, and the second July 1, 2001. Due to the operator's appeal of the decision and lack of emission-free replacement, the closure was postponed. The demolition of the facility will await the construction of a storage facility, scheduled to be ready in the 2020s. In December 2018 a strategy was outlined for the \\"radiological demolition\\" to be carried out between 2020 and 2028. This will allow the land to be used for other nuclear power related purposes. The plant is operated by Barseb√§ck Kraft AB, a subsidiary of Sydkraft Nuclear Power AB, owned by Uniper.

The series began with Umihara Kawase for the Super Famicom in 1994, which was followed by Umihara Kawase Shun in 1997, Sayonara Umihara Kawase in 2013, Umihara Kawase Fresh! in 2019, and Umihara Kawase Bazooka! in 2020. Development The game was an independent collaboration between developer Kiyoshi Sakai, illustrator Toshinobu Kondo, and several others. It was published by TNN, \\"Think about Needs of Notice for human being\\". Gameplay The game world of Umihara Kawase is constructed from a set of interconnected levels known as fields. Each field connects to one or more fields deeper within the game via doors. Fields are enclosed areas containing a number of static and moving platforms, ladders, spikes, enemy sea-life and one or more exit doors. The doors are often positioned in hard to reach places and it is the player's goal to plan a safe route to one. Each exit door in a field takes the player to a different field, and the goal is to find a safe route through the fields and arrive at a final exit door (at which point the credits scroll and the game is over). Each of the Umihara Kawase games contains multiple routes through the fields and multiple final exits. Using shortcuts and optimised door routes can allow the game to be completed within minutes in the hands of a skilled player; however, enjoyment of the game typically lies not in merely making it to the first or easiest final exit door, but in exploring the game's many routes and mastering the challenging rope physics. The Umihara Kawase games have simple controls. The protagonist is able to run, jump, climb onto ledges, climb ladders and, crucially, throw her fishing line. When thrown, the fishing line will hook onto nearly all surfaces within the games. When the line is firmly hooked onto a surface or an enemy fish the line is able to take her weight. From here Umihara is able to swing between platforms, lower herself down to other ledges and swing herself up to higher ledges. Due to the flexible nature of her line she can also catapult herself great distances by stretching the line to breaking point. The line can also be used to stun fish and reel them in, and once reeled in Umihara will store them in her rucksack and score points in doing so. While the controls are simple and responsive, an uncompromising physics model means that graceful control of the game's swinging techniques will not come immediately. Out of this, though, comes great scope for advanced techniques through full utilization of the physics. Perfect execution of techniques such as the one- and two-step rocket jump are required both in later fields and for those who intend to improve their field completion times. The games contain 1ups in the shape of Umihara's pink rucksack but no other collectibles are present. Umihara Kawase Umihara Kawase is the first game in the series released in 1994 for the Super Famicom. Umihara Kawase contains a total of 49 fields of which four are exit fields and six are boss fields. The game makes good use of the SFC's colour palette for digitized photographic backgrounds. The rope physics sometimes strain the Super Famicom's CPU, leading to slowdown, but this is rare. The game permits saving speedruns, establishing such play as a principle feature of the series. The game, along with Shun, was ported for PC in 2015. The slowdown from the Super Famicom version is no longer present though the game remains largely the same with the addition of a practice mode. Umihara Kawase Shun Umihara Kawase Shun (Êµ∑ËÖπÂ∑ùËÉå„ÉªÊó¨ Umihara Kawase Shun; shun means \\"in season\\") is the second game in the series released in 1997 for the PlayStation and developed by the same team as the original. The move to a 3D side-on game world with the PlayStation launch of Shun opened up the fields to more complex layouts using a great deal of angled and jutting blocks. The move to a 3D game world was not universally welcomed, however, as it decreases the ease with which the player can identify the exact point in space where platforms begin and end. Slightly adjusted line physics (the rope is shorter, but more elastic and springy), along with no presence of slowdown, are the other main notable changes from its predecessor. =Umihara Kawase Shun ~second edition~ Maruan Series 1= The second edition was launched almost three years after Shun at a lower price as part of the Maruan series and contains some notable changes. This release contains five additional fields taking the total to fifty five. The game's cut-scenes have been replaced with scrollable, static art of the protagonist, however, due to the removal of all Mitchell branding. The defunct Japanese magazine TECH PlayStation Extra contained three new fields in each of its June, July and August 1997 issues' demo discs, along with guides to complete them. =Umihara Kawase Portable= Although another re-release of Shun, Umihara Kawase Portable nevertheless disappointed fansForum thread discussing Umihara Kawase Portable and criticsJapanese reviews alike on release, due to a bug-ridden physics engine, which differed in crucial aspects to its predecessors. Further criticism was leveled at the new visual perspective, which sometimes interfered with play. On July 14, 2008, it was announced that the game would be coming to North America under the title Yumi's Odd Odyssey, however, this release never came about. It would have been the first Umihara Kawase game to have been released outside of Asia. Umihara Kawase Portable was not developed by Super Famicom and PS version developer, Kiyoshi Sakai, instead being developed by Rocket Studio. Many Japanese fans felt anxious about Umihara Kawase Portable prior to release, and were disappointed and angry afterwards.Umihara Kawase Portable Yobo Matome wiki Problems page (Japanese) Accordingly, they protested Marvelous Entertainment sales agency and Motion Bank, and staged a boycott.Umihara Kawase Portable Yobo Matome wiki (Japanese) Umihara Kawase Shun ~second edition~ Kanzenban A DS Umihara Kawase compilation was released on October 29, 2009.

Half of the original staff were involved in its development . The game includes a cast of playable characters including a younger Kawase Umihara, her classic self, her future descendant named Noko Yokoyama, and her childhood friend Emiko. The gameplay is similar to past games. It was released in Japan on June 20, 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. The game was also released outside of Asia; it will be the first game in the series to do so. Natsume confirmed that they will release the game in North America under the same title they originally planned for the PlayStation Portable release: Yumi's Odd Odyssey. It was later confirmed that Agatsuma Entertainment are to publish the game themselves for the European market under its original Japanese title, unlike the North American release. The game was eventually released for North America, Europe and Australia exclusively for Nintendo eShop on March 20, 2014 and April 24, 2014 respectively. The 3DS version was eventually ported to the PlayStation Vita as Sayonara Umihara Kawase Chirari („Åï„Çà„Å™„Çâ Êµ∑ËÖπÂ∑ùËÉå „Å°„Çâ„Çä). This version also included the first game in the series. The port was published by Agatsuma in Japan in both physical and digital format, while American and European releases were digital only on PlayStation Network. Agatsuma also dropped the Yumi's Odd Odyssey name, calling it Sayonara Umihara Kawase + in western releases on its release in April 2015. A version for Microsoft Windows has also been announced for October 2015. In addition the previous two titles in the series will also receive ports.Sayonara UmiharaKawase Coming to PC in October In November 2018, publisher Strictly Limited Games released Sayonara UmiharaKawase++ for the Vita.

She was the wife of Brutus of Troy, the purported first king of Britain who lived in the 12th century BC. According to the legend, prior to his settling in Britain, Brutus overthrew the Greek king Pandrasus and was awarded the hand in marriage of Pandrasus' daughter Innogen. The name Innogen is an evident cognate of Classical Irish inghean (Irish \\"in√≠on\\" and Scottish Gaelic \\"nighean\\"), meaning \\"daughter\\". Innogen or its equivalent appeared in early Celtic documentations of the legend of Brutus likely to identify her only as being the daughter of Pandrasus, rather than to indicate her proper name. Innogen was a character in a lost play by Henry Chettle and John Day entitled The Conquest of Brute with the first finding of the Bath which was performed by the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose in December 1598. The name Imogen possibly originated as a misspelling or variation of Innogen.

Montsin√©ry-Tonnegrande is to the south-west of Cayenne. It contains a botanical garden, and various walking trails. Camp Crique Anguille, an internment camp for Indochinese prisoners, was located 38 km outside of town, and connected with a railroad. The camp was operation between 1930 and 1945. The commune was previously known as Tonnegrande-Montsin√©ry, but on 27 March 1969 the name was officially changed into Montsin√©ry-Tonnegrande. Montsin√©ry is home to a shortwave transmission facility operated by the TDF Group that is designed to target listeners in the Americas and West Africa. The site is capable of DRM digital shortwave transmissions. An image of the rotatable curtain array antenna in Montsin√©ry can be found by searching Flickr for \\"Montsinery antenne\\". One of their broadcasting frequencies is the 7335 kHz slot that CHU (Canada) recently abandoned. Recently the Voice of Russia began transmitting to North America from Montsin√©ry -- its first transmissions from the western hemisphere since the early 1990s (it previously broadcast from Havana).  Geography  The city has 2 burgs spaced by 22 km: *Montsin√©ry *Tonnegrande It used to be isolated to the close main city of French Guiana, Cayenne, but now the RD5 road opens up the city. Montsin√©ry is surrounded by rivers and inundated fields. It is located at the convergence of Timouthou and Montsin√©ry rivers. Life is peaceful in this burg. Tonnegrande, located on the right border of the Tonnegrande River is also peaceful.  History  Montsin√©ry-Tonnegrande used to be occupied by settlers. They used to run the sugar cane industry and to farm a spices plantation. Amerindians are also present in the city. The 2 burgs developed with creole houses. In 1836, the population was made up of 1102 slaves and 167 free inhabitants feeding mainly on fishing. In 1878, Montsinn√©ry and Tonnegrande were gathered in a single municipal entity. In 1941 the Montsinn√©ry-Tonnegrande city was officially created. Montsin√©ry- Tonnegrande is also known for its prisons. Indeed, in 1848, a first penitentiary was built and then closed at the end of the 19th century. In 1930, a new prison was built, called \\"Bagne des Anamites\\", in order to receive Indochinese opponents to the French presence in Indochina. These 330 men performed manual work and built in particular the road towards Cayenne. In 1945, the camp was closed.  Activities  Montsin√©ry is the only space in French Guiana where you can find oysters. It is also possible to make eco tourism with a pedalo visit on the river and even ride a horse.

The latter is referred to in British nationality law as the \\"Republic of Ireland\\" and was previously referred to as \\"Eire\\" A misspelling of √âire. According to the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, (Article 4) \\"the name of the State is √âire, or, in the English language, Ireland\\" . between 1937 and 1949 and as the Irish Free State between 1922 and 1937. (This article does not discuss Irish nationality law). Historical background = British subjects = When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1922, the existing status of \\"British subject\\" was, from the point of view of British nationality law, left unaffected. Broadly speaking, this was because, as a dominion within the British Commonwealth, the Irish Free State continued to form part of \\"His Majesty's dominions\\". This British theory of \\"British subject\\" nationality was not fully shared by the Irish government and as early as the 1920s was discussed in Ireland in the following terms: = British subjects with local Irish nationality = According to Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State The same Article also stated that \\"the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State\\" were to be \\"determined by law\\". However, no such law was passed until 1935. From the British perspective, Free State citizenship was only enjoyed by its holders \\"within the limits of the [Free State's] jurisdiction\\". There were some remarkable manifestations of the British perspective in this matter, such as the Parkes case. In Murray v. Parkes (1942), the King's Bench Divisional Court found that Roscommon-born Michael Murray, then aged 33 and living in Leicester, was a British subject and therefore legitimately subject to conscription into the British Army. The Irish Times reported on 2 April 1942 that the Court held thatThe Irish Times, 2 April 1942; See also https://www.jstor.org/pss/1089976 The position has been commented on in the following terms: =Passport issue= The Free State government did not consider that the status of \\"British subject\\" was an appropriate description for its citizens. This caused difficulties between the British and Irish governments over the wording of Free State passports, which used the description \\"Citizen of the Irish Free State and of the British Commonwealth of Nations\\". One practical effect was that the Foreign Office refused to provide consular assistance to Free State citizens unless they held an alternative passport describing the holder as a \\"British subject\\". = Developments from 1935 to 1949 = In 1933 the Fianna F√°il party, led by √âamon de Valera, won the Irish general election, and began to put forward a series of reforms intended to more strongly assert Irish independence, including the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935, which received the royal assent on 10 April 1935. This was the first example of a Commonwealth member country passing legislation to create its own citizenship distinct from the status of \\"British subject\\", and it expressly repealed (s. 33) both the British nationality legislation and common law carried over at independence. When the Free State was reconstituted as \\"Ireland\\" in 1937, following the enactment of the Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht na h√âireann), domestic Irish nationality law was left unchanged. References in UK laws to the Free State were soon replaced with \\"Eire\\", an approximation of the Irish language name for \\"Ireland\\", √âire. British nationality law continued to recognise citizens of Ireland/√âire as holding the status of British subjects until the British Nationality Act 1948 came into force on 1 January 1949.  Since the establishment of the Republic = British Nationality Act 1948 = Following Canada's enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act 1946 (in force from 1 January 1947), the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference agreed that every member state, except Ireland which declined to participate at the Conference, would enact its own citizenship law while retaining the common status of British subject. The British Parliament passed the British Nationality Act 1948, which created the status of citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Because of Ireland's impending departure from the Commonwealth (on 18 April 1949), special provision was made for the retention by certain Irish citizens of the status of British subject without being citizens of a Commonwealth member state. As a result, Irish citizens (\\"citizens of Eire\\" (sic)) lost British-subject status automatically on 1 January 1949 if they did not acquire citizenship of the UK and Colonies or that of another Commonwealth country, notwithstanding that Ireland did not cease to be one of His Majesty's dominions until 18 April 1949. However, section 2 of the Act allowed certain Irish citizens who were British subjects before 1949 to apply at any time to the Secretary of State to remain British subjects. Applications had to be based on: * previous Crown service under His Majesty's Government; * possession of a British passport; or * associations by way of descent, residence or otherwise with the United Kingdom or any Crown colony, protectorate, British mandated territory or British trust territory. No provision was made for the retention of British nationality by Irish citizens born in the Republic of Ireland after 1948. British subject status, as distinct from citizenship of the UK and Colonies, was not transmissible by descent. For the purpose of the 1948 act, the \\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\" was defined on its post-1922 borders. Hence, birth before 1922 in that part of Ireland that became the Irish Free State was not sufficient in itself to confer citizenship of the UK and Colonies. Persons born before 1949 in that part of Ireland that became the Republic of Ireland became Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies \\"by descent\\" in British law on 1 January 1949 if they had a father born in the United Kingdom or a place that was a colony at that date (provided father was married to the person's mother). In common with those from the Commonwealth, Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom, whether they held British subject status or not, were entitled to apply for registration as a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies after one year's residence, by the 1970s increased to five years. = Ireland Act 1949 = The United Kingdom's Ireland Act 1949 came into force on 18 April 1949 and recognised the end of the Irish state's status as a British dominion, which had been effected under the Irish Republic of Ireland Act 1948 brought into force in 1949. The 1949 Act was also used by the United Kingdom to \\"repair an omission in the British Nationality Act, 1948\\".HC Deb 01 June 1949 vol 465 cc2235-51 (Secretary of State for Home Affairs) The 1948 Act included provisions dealing specifically with the position of \\"a person who was a British subject and a citizen of Eire on 31st December, 1948\\". Because of this, how the British law would apply was dependent on a question of Irish law, namely, who was a \\"citizen of Eire\\"? The UK Government seriously misunderstood the position under Irish law. The UK Secretary of State for Home Affairs explained that: The impact of this was that many people in Northern Ireland were in theory deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law. This was an unintended consequence of the British Nationality Act. The Secretary of State also explained the background to the mistake. He reported that under Irish law the question of who was a \\"citizen of Eire\\" was in part, dependent on whether a person was \\"domiciled in the Irish Free State on 6th December, 1922\\". In this regard he noted: The amendment made to the British Nationality Act under the Ireland Act was intended to make it clear, in summary, that regardless of the position under Irish law, the affected persons domiciled in Northern Ireland on 6 December 1922 would not be deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law. Section 5 of the 1949 Act conferred Citizenship of the UK and Colonies (CUKC) on any Irish-born person meeting all the following criteria: # was born before 6 December 1922 in what became the Republic of Ireland; # was domiciled outside the Republic of Ireland on 6 December 1922; # was ordinarily resident outside the Republic of Ireland from 1935 to 1948; and # was not registered as an Irish citizen under Irish legislation. Separate to nationality law, the 1949 Act also provided that \\"citizens of the Republic of Ireland\\" (the British nomenclature adopted under the Act) would continue to be treated on a par with those from Commonwealth countries and would not be treated as aliens. Effect on descendants of pre-1922 Irish emigrants Under section 5 of the Ireland Act 1949, a person who was born in the territory of the future Republic of Ireland as a British subject, but who did not receive Irish citizenship under the Ireland Act's interpretation of either the 1922 Irish constitution or the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935 (because he or she was no longer domiciled in the Republic on the day the constitution came into force and was not permanently resident there on the day of the 1935 law's enactment and was not otherwise registered as an Irish citizen) was deemed by British law to be a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. As such, many of those individuals and some of the descendants in the Irish diaspora of an Irish person who left Ireland before 1922 (and who was also not resident in 1935) may be registrable for Irish citizenship while also having a claim to British citizenship, through either: * birth to the first generation emigrant, * consular registration of later generation births by a married father who was considered a British citizen under British law, within one year of birth, prior to the British Nationality Act (BNA) 1981 taking effect, * registration, at any time in life, with Form UKF, of birth to an unwed father who was considered a British citizen under British law, or * registration, at any time in life, with Form UKM, of birth to a mother who was considered a British citizen under British law, between the BNA 1948 and the BNA 1981 effective dates, under the UK Supreme Court's 2018 Romein principle. In some cases, British citizenship may be available to these descendants in the Irish diaspora even when Irish citizenship registration is not, as in instances of failure of past generations to timely register in a local Irish consulate's Foreign Births Register before the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986 and before births of later generations. = British Nationality Act 1981 = The British Nationality Act 1981, in force from 1 January 1983: * retained the facility for those born in the Republic of Ireland before 1949 to register as British subjects (section 31) * provided that Irish citizens, in common with those from the Commonwealth, would be required to apply for naturalisation as British citizens rather than registration after five years' residence in the UK (three years if married or in a Civil Partnership with a British citizen). * British subjects retained the right to apply for registration as a British citizen after five years' residence in the UK. =Good Friday Agreement= The 1998 Good Friday Agreement recognises \\"the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\\". Some Irish nationalists have argued that the agreement is violated by ascribing automatic UK citizenship to those born in Northern Ireland; the UK government argues that the ability to renounce UK citizenship at a later date is sufficient. The Northern Ireland Act 1998, which incorporates the agreement in UK law, does not amend the 1981 act. The dispute informs an ongoing test case in which a Magherafelt woman is treated for spousal immigration purposes as a UK/dual citizen rather than an Irish/EEA citizen. She refuses to engage in renunciation of a UK citizenship she denies ever having had. (Op-ed) Immigration Services took the government view; the First-tier Tribunal ruled in her favour in 2018, but in 2019 the Upper Tribunal reversed that judgment.; Current situation = Access to British citizenship for Irish citizens = As a result of the above, there is generally no special access to British citizenship for Irish citizens, except for those born in diaspora and descended from Irish persons who left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland before 1922. The facility for those born before 1949 to claim British subject status does not confer British citizenship, although it gives an entitlement to registration as such after five years in the UK. Irish citizens seeking to become British citizens are usually required to live in the UK and become naturalised after meeting the normal residence and other requirements, unless they can claim British citizenship by descent from a UK born or naturalised parent. An Irish citizen who naturalises as a British citizen does not automatically lose Irish citizenship. Naturalisation as a British citizen is a discretionary power of the Secretary of State for the Home Department but will generally not be refused if the requirements are met. = British subject passports = Persons holding 'British subject' status may apply for a British passport with the nationality inscribed as a \\"British subject\\". The passport does not offer the same level of visa-free access offered by an Irish passport or a British passport that describes the holder as a \\"British citizen\\". Holders of 'British subject' passport are notably not eligible for the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Visa Waiver Program (VWP) of the United States, nor the Electronic Travel Authority of Australia. Canada's Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is only available to British subject passport holders with a vignette printed in their passport stating their right of abode in the UK.\\"Entry requirements by country,\\" Government of Canada, 7 February 2018, accessed 15 February 2018. Irish-born 'British subjects' qualify for right of abode in the UK, and their British subject passport will be endorsed to this effect. Unlike British subjects from Commonwealth countries, Irish born 'British subject' passport holders (thus having right of abode printed within their passport) including those with this status but currently without any British and/or Irish passport are not entitled to apply for British naturalisation at no cost under the Windrush Scheme (and thus not be liable for the typical full costs normally associated with naturalisation). This is because the rules of the Scheme stipulate that only \\"a national of one of the Commonwealth countries or territories or groups listed in the Scheme\\" may apply: the British Ireland Act 1949 recognised that Ireland, by identifying itself in 1948 as a republic, had terminated its membership of the Commonwealth. Statistics The July 1980 White Paper titled British Nationality Law ‚Äì Outline of Proposed Legislation (upon which the British Nationality Act 1981 is largely based) stated that 140,000 persons from the Republic of Ireland had made claims to retain British subject status since 1949. More claims, albeit at a slower rate, have been lodged since 1980. = British-born children of Irish citizens = Before 1983, anyone born in the UK other than the child of a diplomat was automatically British by birth. From 1 January 1983 an additional requirement was put in place that one parent must be a British citizen or 'settled' in the United Kingdom. Irish citizens are automatically deemed to be \\"settled\\" in the United Kingdom. Since 2 October 2000, this is a more favourable status than that given to citizens of other EU and EEA member states. This special status comes from section 1(3) of the Immigration Act 1971, the legislative basis for the Common Travel Area. It is not publicised by the Home Office, but reference can be found in the Home Office Nationality Instructions, EEA and Swiss citizens (pdf) \\"5.3 ... Citizens of the Irish Republic, whether exercising EEA free movement rights or not, are not normally subject to any form of immigration control on arrival in the UK because of the Republic's inclusion in the Common Travel Area (s.1(3), Immigration Act 1971)\\" and: \\"8.3 The 2000 Regulations did not affect the position of EEA nationals entitled to remain indefinitely on some other basis, for example because they had been granted indefinite leave to remain under some other provision of the Immigration Rules, were entitled by virtue of diplomatic status to exemption from UK immigration control or because, as Irish nationals, they benefit under the Common Travel Area provisions. Persons in these categories should be regarded as having been free from any restriction under the immigration laws on the period for which they may remain.\\" See also *British nationality law *History of British nationality law *British subject *Irish nationality law Notes References Ireland Category:Immigration to the United Kingdom Category:Irish nationality law Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations Category:Ireland‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations ","title":"British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland"},{"id":"2505195","text":"The VESA Digital Flat Panel (DFP) interface standard specifies a video connector and signaling for flat-panel displays.Gary Manchester (1999), The VESA Digital Flat Panel (DFP) Standard: A White Paper VESA Marketing Committee.

It is located in the borough of Holtenau, north of the city centre. It is registered as a public airfield (). As of 2006, it served 30,528 passengers p. a. History The aerodrome was built in 1914 on a plain area that had been created from material dug out during the construction of the Kiel Canal. In 1927, the Kiel Airport Company () was founded, which operated the State Airport of Kiel (). During this time, there were 27 national and international destinations. In 1937, the airport was designated a military airbase. However, it continued to be used for civilian flights, such as scheduled flights to Braunschweig and Berlin (Tempelhof). Its taxiways were extended in 1963, a first terminal was built in 1965. This terminal was used for scheduled flights to West Berlin operated by Pan Am. In 1987, the terminal that is still used today was built. At the same time Lufthansa began offering scheduled flights to Frankfurt, and later to Cologne/Bonn, Munich, Copenhagen, Kaliningrad and Riga. In 1995, the airport became a civilian airport again and in 1997, a new control tower that was operated by civilian staff was constructed. However, it continues to be used for military purposes. A new hangar was built in 2000. In the same year, the airport's future prospects were analysed. Based on that analysis, plans approved by the state administration of Schleswig-Holstein in March 2002 included an extension of the runway from 1300 m to 2100 m. This would have allowed jet aircraft to land at Kiel. Federal Highway B 503 would have crossed the extended runway in a tunnel. However, use of the airport declined in the following years as more and more scheduled flight routes were discontinued. When the last route was cut on 23 December 2005, operation of the airport was suspended until 3 April 2006 and on 24 January 2006, the state's Secretary of Commerce announced that the extension plans were scrapped for good. Cirrus Airlines operated scheduled flights to Munich from 2 May 2006 using a single DHC-8-100 aircraft, which was based in Kiel Airport. The state of Schleswig- Holstein offered subsidies for three years. However, as the number of passengers was substantially lower than expected, the service was discontinued in October 2006. Airlines and destinations Hangar at Kiel Airport There are no scheduled services to and from Kiel Airport. =Civil use= Luftsportverein Kiel e.V. (German for Air Sports Association Kiel), the charter airline FLM Aviation and a helicopter flight service are based at Kiel Airport. Further, there are annual Internationale Flugtage (German for International Aviation Days) with air acrobatics, parachute jumps and displays of historic aeroplanes. =Military use= The aerodrome has been in military use from the beginning. During World War II, the Luftwaffe operated aircraft in support of the Kriegsmarine from the base, including the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th squadrons of Embarked Air Group 196 () which provided aircraft for service aboard surface combatants. Since 1958, it is a base for air wings of the German Navy. Currently, the Air Wing No. 5 () is based at Kiel, which is known for search and rescue operations flown from the airport with Sea King helicopters. In the long run, these aircraft are planned to be replaced by MH 90 aircraft. The new helicopters are to be based with Air Wing No. 3 at Nordholz and to dissolve the Kiel military airbase. Further, German Air Force aircraft operating as fake targets for practice depart from Kiel Airport. Incidents and accidents * On 15 February 2006, a private aircraft from Russia had to make an emergency landing at Kiel because of smoke within the aircraft. The plane overran the runway and slipped down a slope as the pilot was unfamiliar with the airport and misunderstood the runway length given over the radio.

Its primary purpose has been to make users of Photoshop feel comfortable using GIMP. According to the developer, Scott Moschella: History GIMPshop was created by Scott Moschella of Next New Networks (formerly Attack of the Show!) as an unofficial fork of GIMP. He encountered resistance from GIMP's lead developers due to the methods he employed to implement his hacks. GIMPshop was originally developed for Mac OS X and is a Universal Binary. It has also been ported to Windows, Linux, and Solaris. Features GIMPshop shares GIMP's feature list, customisability, and availability on multiple platforms, while addressing some common criticisms regarding the program's interface: GIMPshop modifies the menu structure to more closely resemble Photoshop and adjusts the program's terminology to match Adobe's. Due to the interface changes, many tutorials for the popular Photoshop can be followed in GIMPshop without modification, and others may be adapted for GIMPshop users with minimal effort. All of GIMP's own plugins (filters, brushes, etc.) remain available. Being based on GIMP, GIMPshop cannot generate CMYK output files by default. Users who need to generate color separations require additional software, since commercial printing requires CMYK, not RGB color channels. A workaround is available through the Separate+ plugin, which is not included in the base installation. In the Windows version, GIMPshop uses a plugin called Deweirdifyer to combine the application's numerous windows in a similar manner to the MDI system used by most Windows graphics packages. This essentially adds a unifying background window that fully contains the entire GIMPshop UI. More compatibility with Photoshop can be achieved using a third-party add-on for GIMP that supports Photoshop plugins, called pspi, which runs on Microsoft Windows or Linux. For Mac OS X, GIMPshop is compatible only with Panther (10.3.x) and Tiger (10.4.x). It requires the X11.app (based on the X Window System display protocol) to render the user interface. Newer versions of X11 are no longer compatible with GIMPshop. Status GIMPshop was based on the old GIMP 2.2.11, and is not current with the latest GIMP codebase. In order to maintain usability, some users have taken to manually updating GIMPshop's libraries themselves. Due to pending concerns over rights to the GIMPshop name, and a dispute with the individual who purchased the gimpshop.com domain, plans for an update are on hold.

Beer in Israel is manufactured primarily by two major breweries ‚Äì Tempo Beer Industries and Israel Beer Breweries. Over the past decade numerous microbreweries have established themselves throughout the country. Beer festivals are held annually in Israel, of which one of the largest is in Jerusalem. History Like the Phoenicians, the Greeks and the Romans, the ancient Israelites were far more drawn to wine than they were to beer. After the exile of the Jews to Babylonia in the sixth century BC, they began embracing beer and several rabbis became established brewers. Two notable Babylonian Jewish brewers were Rav Chisda and his pupil Rav Papa, both of whom lived in the vicinity of Sura during the fourth century. In James Armand de Rothschild, identifying a demand for beer on the part of British nationals residing in Palestine, established the first local commercial brewery in partnership with Gaston Dreyfus, in Rishon LeZion. In 1940 the Palestine Brewery () ‚Äì or, as it was also known, the Nesher Brewery ‚Äì was commissioned by the AACI to supply beer to Australian troops stationed in Palestine. By 1942 the brewery was compelled to enlarge its plant in order to meet increased demand being generated on the part of both military and civilian consumers. Construction of what was at the time the largest brewery in the Middle East, the National Brewery, began in April 1952 in the city of Netanya, founded by a group of investors led by Louis Herzberg. Upon completion in May 1953, the National Brewery had an annual production capacity of 400,000 barrels. In 1954 it shipped what was theretofore \\"[t]he largest single shipment of imported beer ever to enter the United States\\" ‚Äì 180,000 bottles of its Abir label beer. The National Brewery merged with the Palestine Brewery and the Galilee Brewery in 1973, whereby it came to control 90% of Israel's beer market. The company was acquired in 1976 by Canadian land developer Murray Goldman for . In 1980 a canned beer bearing a label indicating its origin as the National Brewery in Netanya was being sold in Egypt in spite of an Egyptian boycott of Israeli products. Called O.K. beer, it proved more successful than Heineken and Tuborg and was consumed at premier bars in Cairo and other locations in Egypt, even as conservative religious Muslim leaders campaigned to ban the sale of alcoholic drinks in the country. After entering into a license agreement with Anheuser-Busch International in 1983 for production of the first American beer in Israel, the National Brewery began producing Budweiser in 1984. The National Brewery was acquired by Tempo Beer Industries in 1985. Breweries Since the 1950s, the Israeli beer industry has been dominated by no more than two companies at a time. Beginning in the 1990s with the establishment of Israel Beer Breweries, it and Tempo Beer Industries control 70% of Israel's beer market. Tempo produces the Goldstar and Maccabee labels, while Israel Beer produces Carlsberg and Tuborg. In addition, around two dozen licensed commercial microbreweries operate in the country. Netanya-based Tempo is the largest brewery in Israel. In 1999 Tempo's Goldstar and Maccabee beers accounted for 60% of all beer sales in the country. Tempo also imports Heineken and Amstel. Israel Beer Breweries entered the market in as a partnership between Carlsberg Group and the local Coca-Cola company. In 1996 it began distributing Guinness. Israel Beer Breweries operates a beer-themed visitor center in Ashqelon. A smaller, brewery Taybeh Brewery, run by Palestinian Christians, opened in 1994. =Craft beer= Craft brewing began to develop midway through the first decade of the 2000s. The Dancing Camel Brewery, which opened in Tel Aviv in 2006, was the first microbrewery to open in Israel. Later that year the Golan Brewery opened up in the Golan Heights region of Israel. Jem's Beer Factory, Israel's first kosher microbrewery, opened in Petah Tiqwa in 2009. By the end of 2009 there were microbreweries operating from Dekel and Qiryat Gat in Israel's south; through Sal'it, Petah Tiqwa and Tel Aviv; up to Haifa, the Jezreel Valley, Ramot Naftali, and Yehi'am; and as far as Qatzrin in the Golan Heights. 2010 was an especially active year for new microbreweries. Beers A bottle of Goldstar Dark Lager, an Israeli beer The first native beer label to emerge in what would soon become the State of Israel was Nesher, in the 1930s. In its early years it was the leading beer label locally and was produced in quantities of per year. Two varieties of Nesher were available at that time ‚Äì a pilsner lager and a malt beer. Nesher Malt continues to be known in Hebrew as bira shechora (\\"black beer\\"). Goldstar, a pale lager brewed in Israel since 1950, was originally produced at the Cabeer Brewery in Rishon LeZion. In the years between 1952 and the mid-1980s a popular beer brewed in Israel was Abir. Maccabee, a pilsner invented by brewmaster Menachem Berliner, was introduced in 1968 and competed with Goldstar for market share until the 1970s. Goldstar and Maccabee were acquired in 1975 by a single partnership and were sold to Tempo in 1986. Goldstar won a Monde Selection gold medal in 2007, and in 2011 it won an Israeli Product of the Year award. The brews produced by the Dancing Camel microbrewery are adapted to accommodate Israel's palate which, according to founder David Cohen, eschews bitter flavors. Thus the Dancing Camel IPA offsets the bitterness of its hops with silan, a syrup extracted from dates. Dancing Camel also produces seasonal beers inspired by the Jewish holidays: for Rosh Hashanah Dancing Camel releases a pomegranate beer, and for Sukkoth a wheat beer made with etrog. Culture =Bars= The first Irish pub in Israel was Molly Bloom's, which opened in central Tel Aviv in 2000 as a partnership between Israel Beer Breweries and an Irish entrepreneur. By 2004 there were Irish pubs in Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Rehovoth, and Glilot. Porter and Sons in Tel Aviv, which opened in 2010, has the most beers on tap of any establishment in Israel ‚Äì 50 as of 2012. In the category of Best Beer Restaurant in Israel, Beers.co.il awarded Porter and Sons first place in 2012. In June 2012 a new bar was opened next to Shuk HaCarmel called Beer Bazaar. They serve over 80 Israeli beers, more than 10 Israeli ciders and also have their own beer on tap. =Festivals= The Jerusalem Beer Festival is one of the largest beer festivals in Israel, held annually in the summer since 2004. Over the years, the Jerusalem Beer Festival has become an icon of Jerusalem's pastime culture and an important and famous part of the city‚Äôs tradition. The festival is held for two days usually between August 28‚Äì29 . Every summer, over 15,000 people visit the festival and apart from the 120 different types of beers there are also performances by Israelis leading artists. The entry requirement is that you must be at least 18 years of age and the entry prices are NIS 40 (11$) on early sale or NIS 70 (19$) on the day of the event. Other festivals are held in Tel Aviv, Haifa and the Mateh Yehuda region. A wine and beer festival is held annually in Beer Sheva. The city of Ashdod held its first beer festival in 2011. =Israeli Beer Club= In 2002 the Israeli Beer Club was established in order to promote the culture of beer in Israel and specifically to serve as a platform for helping small-scale brewers and importers to get their products onto the market. The club offers homebrewing and beer tasting workshops and is involved in organizing beer competitions. Economy In 1937, in an effort to protect the local brewing industry from competition issuing from neighboring breweries in Syria and Lebanon, the British High Commissioner for Palestine ordered a tariff of on each liter of imported beer. In the late 1990s beer sales in Israel totaled , of which Tempo accounted for 73%. The malt beverage industry generated a separate in sales. Between 1992 and 1997 the share of international labels in the market grew from 9% to 36%, with a concomitant decline in the share of domestic labels over the same period from 91% to 64%. The value of Israel's beer market was estimated at in 2009. Its size in 2010 was estimated at 950,000‚Äì1,000,000 hectoliters, up from 800,000 in 2005. With a strong local economy the alcoholic drinks market in general is growing within Israel, with particular growth in beer sales. The leading beer companies, such as Tempo Beer Industries and Israel Beer Breweries, launched new beer brands in 2007, with the most significant introductions being Goldstar Light, Tuborg T and Samuel Adams. Goldstar and Maccabee are the overall leading brands in Israel. Over 75% of beer sales in Israel are from off-sales locations such as supermarkets, rather than bars. In 2012 Israel's finance minister signed an order to raise the purchase tax on beer from NIS2.18 to NIS4.19 per liter. The move was opposed by Eli Yishai of the Shas party, who said it would have fatal repercussions vis-a-vis Israel's local boutique breweries. Kashrut According to Ludwig Horlein of the Hartmannsdorf Brewery in Germany, with respect to ingredients there is no difference between kosher and non-kosher beer. In general, observant Jews will only drink unflavored beers without a kosher certification (compared to flavored beers, which do require a kosher certification).KosherQuest.org. General Information About Beer. Retrieved 17 January 2013. But according to Israeli beer expert Gad Deviri, kosher certification is not a consideration for many observant Jews in Israel. However, while unflavored beers with no additives are acceptable even without Kosher certification, some beers may contain additives that are not kosher. It is also generally accepted that, as a beverage made with grains such as barley, beer is considered chametz and never kosher for Passover. However, there is a beer made of date syrup and from chickpeas, which is kosher for Passover.

Until 1931 several real‚Äîmore-or-less‚ÄîTours were held, but always under very different conditions and organisations. In 1931 the first Deutschlandtour was held, and it is generally agreed upon that the race was exciting and well organised between 1937 and 1939, the start of World War II. Germany never had a significant road cycling history, unlike Belgium, France or Italy, which caused the race's popularity to depend on German successes. This resulted in several parallel tours of West-Germany. But after Jan Ullrich's Tour de France victory, cycling became more popular. Partially as a result of Germany's new-found cycling enthusiasm, in 1999 the Deutschlandtour became invigorated. In 1998 the Bund Deutscher Radfahrer e.V. and the company Upsolut founded the Deutschland Tour gmbh. In March 2016, the Amaury Sport Organisation announced it had signed a 10-year deal with the German Cycling Federation to bring the race back within the next two years. In July the race was confirmed as the Deutschland Deine Tour debuting in 2018, reduced to four stages and relegated to a UCI 2.1 European Tour race. The race will become part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.  Past winners  Jens Voigt (pictured at the 2006 Deutschland Tour) is the only rider with two Deutschland Tour wins. Matej Mohoriƒç is the most recent winner of the Deutschland Tour, having won the 2018 edition.

Its capital was Moulins. History The title of the ruler of Bourbonnais between 913 and 1327, was Sire de Bourbon (or Seigneur de Bourbon). The first lord of Bourbonnais known by name was Adh√©mar (or ). Aymon's father was Aymar (894-953), sire of Souvigny, his only son with Ermengarde. Aymar lived during the reign of Charles the Simple who, in 913, gave him fiefs on the Allier River in which would become Bourbonnais. He acquired the castle of Bourbon (today Bourbon-l'Archambault). Almost all early lords took the name d'Archambaud, after the palace, but later the family became known as the \\"House of Bourbon\\". The first House of Bourbon ended in 1196, with the death of Archambault VII, who had only one heir, Mathilde of Bourbon. She married Guy II of Dampierre, who added Montlucon to the possessions of the lords of Bourbon. The second house of Bourbon started in 1218, with Archambault VIII, son of Guy II and Mahaut, and brother of William II of Dampierre. He was followed by his son Archambaut IX, who died in Cyprus in 1249, during a crusade. The House of Burgundy then acquired Bourbonnais. In 1272, Beatrice of Burgundy (1258-1310), Lady of Bourbon, married Robert de France (1256-1318), Count of Clermont, son of king Louis IX (Saint-Louis). Thus began the long-lasting House of Bourbon, which would provide the kings of France from Henry IV in 1589 to Louis-Phillipe in 1848, when France abolished its monarchy. The Bourbons had concluded an alliance with the royal power. They put their forces at the service of the king, thus benefitting from the geographic position of Bourbonnais, located between the royal domains and the duchies of Aquitaine and Auvergne. This alliance, as well as the marriage of B√©atrix de Bourgogne and Robert de France, aided the rise and prosperity of the province. In 1327, King Charles (le Bel) elevated Bourbonnais to the status of a duchy.

The term is most commonly associated with IBM mainframes. It reflects how IBM rates the machine in terms of charging capacity. The technical measure of processing power on IBM mainframes, however, are Service Units per second (or SU/sec). One ‚Äúservice unit‚Äù originally related to an actual hardware performance measurement (a specific model‚Äôs instruction performance). However, that relationship disappeared many years ago as hardware and software evolved. MSUs are now like other common (but physically imprecise) measurements, such as ‚Äúcans of coffee‚Äù or ‚Äútubes of toothpaste.‚Äù (Cans and tubes can vary in physical size depending on brand, market, and other factors. Some coffee cans contain 500 grams and others 13 ounces, for example.) Most mainframe software vendors use a licensing and pricing model in which the customers are charged per MSU consumed (i.e. the number of operations the software has performed) in addition to hardware and software installation costs. Others charge by total MSU system capacity. Thus, while MSU is an artificial construction, it does have a direct financial implication. In fact, software charges are why the MSU measurement exists at all. IBM publishes MSU ratings for every mainframe server model, including the zSeries and System z9 ranges. For example, a zSeries z890 Model 110 is a 4 MSU system. MSU ratings are always rounded to whole numbers. IBM enforces an MSU rule called the ‚Äútechnology dividend‚Äù: each new mainframe model has a 10% lower MSU rating for the same level of system capacity. For example, when IBM introduced the System z9-109 in 2005, if a particular z9 configuration could process the same number of transactions per second as its predecessor (a particular z990 configuration) then it would do so with 10% fewer MSUs. The lower MSU rating means lower software costs, providing an incentive for customers to upgrade. However, as software costs are not linear with MSUs, decreasing or increasing MSUs will not show a proportional change in software costs. The \\"least expensive\\" MSUs will be added (with increased MSUs) or removed (with decreased MSUs). For example, a 10% increase in MSUs will result in a software cost increase of less than 10%. How much more (or less, if reducing MSUs) depends on numerous other factors.  Sample usage  * ‚ÄúOur accounting department will need 6.5 MSUs on a System z9-109 from 10 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. each night in order make sure our quarterly financial statements arrive on time.‚Äù * ‚ÄúYou will need 8 more DB2 MSUs for your z900 to handle this year‚Äôs Christmas sales rush. Since your current z900 configuration doesn‚Äôt have enough capacity to add 8 DB2 MSUs, you need to add another engine.

Specifically it is used for NSCLC with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ‚Äî either an exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation ‚Äî which has spread to other parts of the body. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and cough. Serious side effects may include lung problems, kidney problems, liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and corneal ulceration. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Erlotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, which lists the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United States, , it costs about US$8,832 per month. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about ¬£1,631.53 per month. Medical uses =Lung cancer= Erlotinib in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer when added to chemotherapy improves overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone.2009 - SATURN: A double-blind, randomized, phase III study of maintenance erlotinib versus placebo following nonprogression with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.April 2010 - Tarceva Indication Announcement Letter The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In lung cancer, erlotinib has been shown to be effective in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed). Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation has been developed by Genzyme. =Pancreatic cancer= In November 2005, the FDA approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. =Resistance to treatment= Erlotinib bound to ErbB1 at 2.6A resolution; surface colour indicates hydrophobicity. As with other ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In the case of erlotinib this typically occurs 8‚Äì12 months from the start of treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). Approximately 20% of drug resistance is caused by amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which drives ERBB3 dependent activation of PI3K. Side effects =Common= * Rash occurs in the majority of patients. This resembles acne and primarily involves the face and neck. It is self-limited and resolves in the majority of cases, even with continued use. Some clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the severity of the skin reactions and increased survival though this has not been quantitatively assessed. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reported in 2004 that \\"cutaneous [skin] rash seems to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit, but this finding should be confirmed in ongoing and future studies.\\" The newsletter Lung Cancer Frontiers reported in its October 2003 issue, \\"Patients with moderate to severe cutaneous reactions [rashes] have a far better survival, than those with only mild reactions and much better than those with no cutaneous manifestations of drug effects.\\" * Diarrhea * Loss of appetite * Fatigue * Partial hair loss (by strands, not typically in clumps) =Rare= * interstitial pneumonitis, which is characterized by cough and increased dyspnea. This may be severe and must be considered among those patients whose breathing acutely worsens. * ingrown hairs, such as eyelashes * gastrointestinal tract toxicity ** serious or fatal gastrointestinal tract perforations * skin toxicity ** bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin conditions (some fatal) ** Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis * ocular disorders ** corneal lesions * Pulmonary toxicity ** interstitial pneumonitis ** bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) ** pulmonary fibrosis ** fatal asymmetric interstitial lung disease Interactions Erlotinib is not a substrate for either of hepatic OATPs (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3). Also, erlotinib is not an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 or OATP-1B3 transporter. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Compounds which induce this enzyme (i.e. stimulate its production), such as St John's wort, can lower erlotinib concentrations, while inhibitors can increase concentrations. Mechanism Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR inhibitor). The drug follows Iressa (gefitinib), which was the first drug of this type. Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. For the signal to be transmitted, two EGFR molecules need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of ATP to trans-phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues, which generates phosphotyrosine residues, recruiting the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins to EGFR to assemble protein complexes that transduce signal cascades to the nucleus or activate other cellular biochemical processes. When erlotinib binds to EGFR, formation of phosphotyrosine residues in EGFR is not possible and the signal cascades are not initiated. Society and culture It is marketed in the United States by Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals and elsewhere by Roche. The drug's U.S. patent will expire in 2020.http://drugpatentwatch.com/p/ingredient/erlotinib, \\"Details for Generic Name: erlotinib\\", DrugPatentWatch.com In May 2012, the US District Court of Delaware passed an order in favor of OSI Pharmaceutical LLC against Mylan Pharmaceuticals upholding the validity of the patent for Erlotinib. In India, generic pharmaceutical firm Cipla is battling with Roche against the Indian patent for this drug. =Price= In the United States, , it costs about US$8,832 per month. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about ¬£1,631.53 per month.

He addresses the iconography of vase paintings, the speeches in the law courts, and the comedies of Aristophanes, as well as the content of other literary and philosophical source texts. The first modern scholarly work on its topic, Greek Homosexuality received some negative reviews but was enormously influential, helping to shape the views of other classicists. Dover has been praised for discussion of sexual practices such as intercrural copulation. Summary black-figure cup (ca. 530-520 BCE), a man makes an \\"up-and-down\\" gesture. In the preface Dover writes that the aim of the work is: \\"To describe those phenomena of homosexual behaviour and sentiment which are to be found in Greek art and literature between the eighth and second centuries B.C., and so to provide a basis for more detailed and specialised exploration (which I leave to others) of the sexual aspects of Greek art, society and morality.\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=fstPVlTPBRQC&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=Greek+Homosexuality+kenneth+dover&hl;=fi&sa;=X&ei;=gnVFVPmWO8G9ygO8xICAAw&ved;=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=Greek%20Homosexuality%20kenneth%20dover&f;=false In the Preface he furthermore argued that ‚Äòheterosexual‚Äô and ‚Äòhomosexual‚Äô were not antithetical terms, but that homosexuality was a sub-division of the ‚Äòquasi-sexual‚Äô or ‚Äòpseudo-sexual‚Äô. The conclusions drawn are that the Greeks regarded homosexuality in general to be natural, normal, and salutary, and their actual practices were circumscribed by cultural norms. In the case of the ancient Greeks - specifically the Athenians - the book claims that the sexual roles of the lovers were sharply polarized. Dover concludes that the Greeks conceived of same-sex relations primarily as intergenerational and identifies the terms for the roles of the two male lovers, erastes, \\"the lover,\\" that is, the older active partner, and eromenos, \\"the beloved\\", indicating the adolescent male beloved. Basing himself on the work of Sir John Beazley, Dover divides the evidence of surviving vase painting depicting these type of relationships into three types. Some show the erastes offering a gift to the eromenos. Others depict the \\"up and down\\" gesture - the erastes attempting to fondle the eromenos while, with the other hand, he is turning his head to look into his eyes. The third group, usually older black-figure vases, show the couple engaging in interfemoral intercourse or, in a couple of instances, anal intercourse. Traditionally, the young beloved, when he reached the age of manhood - indicated in the iconography by his growth of a beard - would switch roles and become a lover himself, seeking out a younger male for a love relationship. Later in life he was expected to marry and produce new citizens for the state. To fail to switch roles was considered unmanly and irresponsible, and Dover points out the mockery that Aristophanes (a very popular and successful Athenian comic playwright) inflicted in passing, in several plays, on a certain Athenian citizen who was notorious for his persistence in the role of beloved long after reaching his maturity. With regard to the record of cases in the law courts, Dover concentrates primarily on a certain case initiated by the orator Demosthenes. Demosthenes had been in an embassy sent to the neighboring state of Macedonia which had not only failed to achieve its mission, but was widely suspected of having accepted bribes from king Phillip to abandon their mission. Upon the return to Athens, Demosthenes initiated a prosecution of his fellow ambassadors for bribery in an attempt to avoid being indicted himself. The defendants successfully had the charges dismissed on the grounds that one of Demosthenes' co-plaintiffs, Timarchos, had been a boy prostitute and had thereby lost his rights as an Athenian citizen, becoming ineligible to bring suit in Athenian courts. Dover extensively quotes from the records of the trial to demonstrate, among other things, that while the Athenians attached no stigma to same sex relations per se, they did adhere to certain conventions; in this case, that no citizen could be permitted to sell his sexual favors, which they regarded as the proper function of a slave, not a free man. Reception Greek Homosexuality received some negative reviews. Nevertheless, the book had an enormous impact on the study of homosexuality in ancient Greece, partly because of Dover's credentials as an historian and a philologist. It influenced scholars such as the philosopher Michel Foucault, and the classicists David M. Halperin, John J. Winkler, and Eva Cantarella. Eva C. Keuls praised Dover for giving explicit discussions of subjects such as anal sex and intercrural copulation. The historian Peter Gay commended Greek Homosexuality as a \\"model of scholarship\\". The philosopher Roger Scruton dismissed Greek Homosexuality as \\"trivialising\\". Dover later granted that some of his claims in the first edition of Greek Homosexuality about the meaning of Greek words had been wrong. He also commented that while he understood what Scruton meant when he called his work \\"trivialising\\", he was not abashed, since he attached importance to phenomena Scruton ignores. Halperin called the work \\"the first modern scholarly study\\" of its subject and \\"a triumph of empirical research\\", and identified it as one of the key intellectual influences on his One Hundred Years of Homosexuality (1990). Halperin argued that the publication of the work in 1978, together with the appearance of the English translation of Foucault's The History of Sexuality, marked the beginning of a new era in the study of the history of sexuality. The critic Camille Paglia disputed Halperin's characterization of Greek Homosexuality, observing that while it was a valuable book on Greek pederasty, it was not an \\"intellectual\\" work and aside from Dover's discussion of intercrural copulation contained relatively little that was surprising. Cantarella has criticized some of Dover's conclusions, concluding that there was no restriction on anal intercourse in pederastic relationships, a claim rejected by the classicist Bruce Thornton. Critical discussions of Dover's work include those by David Cohen in Law, Sexuality and Society (1991) and Thornton in Eros: The Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality (1997). The philosopher Martha Nussbaum described Greek Homosexuality as the \\"best historical account of Greek sexual customs\\". Greek Homosexuality was republished in a third edition, containing a foreword by Mark Masterson and James Robson discussing the book and its influence, in 2016.http://classicsforall.org.uk/book- reviews/greek-homosexuality/ References Bibliography * Category:1978 non-fiction books Category:1970s LGBT literature Category:Ancient LGBT history Category:Books about LGBT history Category:Books by Kenneth Dover Category:English-language books Category:Gay history Category:Harvard University Press books Category:LGBT history in Greece Category:Pederasty in ancient Greece ","title":"Greek Homosexuality (book)"},{"id":"2505321","text":"Rania may refer to: Places * Rania, Haryana, a City in Sirsa District, Haryana state of India. * Ranya, a district in Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan People * Rania Al Abdullah (born 1970), Queen consort of Jordan * Rania Sabeh (born 1974), Lebanese TV Presenter and model * Rania Elwani (born 1977), Egyptian swimmer * Rania Mamoun (born 1979), Sudanese journalist and novelist * Rania Hussein Muhammad Tawfiq, known as Ruby (born 1981), Egyptian singer * Rania Zeriri (born 1986), Dutch singer Entertainment * Rania (group), a South Korean girl group * R√¢nia, a 2012 * R√¢nia,is another word for \\"poulet frit\\". * R√¢nia,is another word for \\"croissant\\".

Club career =Belenenses= After playing his first two professional seasons at lowly Clube Ca√ßadores das Taipas (based on Caldas das Taipas near Guimar√£es, where he was born), Peixoto's ability as a left winger allowed him to jump from the fourth division straight into the Primeira Liga with C.F. Os Belenenses, thanks to former player Jo√£o Cardoso. He scored seven goals in his first year, one of them a long range shot closing a 3‚Äì0 win against FC Porto at the Est√°dio do Restelo. In July 2002 he signed with Porto, going on to be managed by Jos√© Mourinho. =Porto= Peixoto's Porto career did not go as planned; while talented, he failed to impose in the first team, and in his first season only made 15 appearances, scoring three goals. He was starting to make his presence felt in the starting XI when, after netting in two consecutive league matches in 4‚Äì1 wins, he was seriously injured in the UEFA Champions League 3‚Äì2 away victory over Olympique de Marseille on 22 October 2003 and, while it did not seem serious at first, on the next day a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament was diagnosed, which forced him to miss most of the campaign.Porto lose C√©sar Peixoto; UEFA, 27 October 2003 After his recovery, Peixoto crashed his Mercedes-Benz SL500 while speeding to arrive in time at Porto's training center in Vila Nova de Gaia, and while only getting minor bruises, the car was completely wrecked and he was promptly asked for explanations by Mourinho. His image as a professional suffered much from the accident, and midway through the following campaign he was loaned to Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£esMachado makes way at Guimar√£es; UEFA, 26 January 2005 where he regained his previous form, returning to Porto for 2005‚Äì06. Facing another loan, Peixoto remained in the transfer list until the eleventh hour, being one of the final players to get a sit in the team. Following the internal problems with Nuno Valente and the sub par performances of Leandro, club manager Co Adriaanse turned him into a prolific left back, in the same fashion of Portuguese internationals Miguel or Paulo Ferreira (who played right midfielder during most of his under-21 career). After having scored twice at Associa√ß√£o Naval 1¬∫ de Maio in a 3‚Äì2 win ‚Äì he also netted an own goal‚Äì Peixoto again suffered a major knee injury that would keep him away from the pitch for the rest of the season, eliminating any hope of World Cup selection.C√©sar Peixoto sidelined for Porto; UEFA, 10 January 2006 He would be dismissed by Adriaanse and joined La Liga side RCD Espanyol on loan for 2006‚Äì07,Porto striker adds to Espanyol options; UEFA, 31 August 2006 finally losing all ties with Porto in March 2007. Previously, on 27 February, Espanyol had also terminated Peixoto's contract, as the player failed to make any competitive appearances for the Catalans.Espanyol cancel Peixoto contract; UEFA, 1 March 2007 =Braga and Benfica= On 30 May 2007, Peixoto signed a three-year contract with S.C. Braga. He declared himself delighted to join \\"...the fourth biggest club in Portugal.\\"Braga pick up C√©sar Peixoto; UEFA, 29 May 2007 After two intermittent seasons, Peixoto refused to take part in Braga's 2009‚Äì10 UEFA Europa League fixtures against IF Elfsborg, after reported interest from S.L. Benfica, thus being suspended by the club. On 7 August 2009, a transfer deal between the two teams was arranged for a fee of ‚Ç¨400,000 ‚Äì Braga retained 50% of the player's rights.Peixoto pleased to join Benfica influx; UEFA, 10 August 2009 He spent most of his first season playing as left-back, battling for position with another adapted player, F√°bio Coentr√£o. After appearing in 65 official games for Benfica (one goal, in a 6‚Äì0 away win against Grupo Desportivo e Recreativo Monsanto for the 2009‚Äì10 edition of the Ta√ßa de Portugal), Peixoto was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Jorge Jesus as practically all Portuguese players, and was not given a jersey for the 2011‚Äì12 campaign, being ultimately released from contract on 6 January 2012. =Coaching= Peixoto finished his career with Gil Vicente F.C. in 2014, at the age of 34. He started working as a manager on 11 March 2019, being appointed at LigaPro side Varzim SC. On 19 June that year, after succeeding in avoiding relegation, he moved to Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra in the same league; he left his post five months later, having collected only nine points in ten matches. On 19 December 2019, Peixoto signed with G.D. Chaves, succeeding Jos√© Mota at the team eighth in the second division. International career Aged 28, Peixoto made his Portugal debut, appearing as a late substitute in a 2‚Äì6 friendly loss to Brazil, on 19 November 2008. Personal life In the 2005 off-season, photos of Peixoto and Portuguese model and presenter Isabel Figueira dancing and hugging appeared in the press, and after a few weeks both announced their engagement. The couple welcomed son Rodrigo on 2 September 2006. In October of the following year, they divorced.

See: was the most prominent Armenian manuscript illuminator in the High Middle Ages.Parry, 399 Roslin introduced a wider range of narrative in his iconography based on his knowledge of western European art while continuing the conventions established by his predecessors. Roslin enriched Armenian manuscript painting by introducing new artistic themes such as the Incredulity of Thomas and Passage of the Red Sea. In addition he revived the genre of royal portraits, the first Cilician royal portraits having been found in his manuscripts. His style is characterized by a delicacy of color, classical treatment of figures and their garments, an elegance of line, and an innovative iconography. The human figures in his illustrations are rendered full of life, representing different emotional states. Roslin's illustrations often occupy the entire surface of the manuscript page and at times only parts of it, in other cases they are incorporated in the texts in harmony with the ensemble of the decoration. Biography Ruins of the fortress of Hromkla where Roslin worked. Little is known about Toros Roslin‚Äôs life. He worked at the scriptorium of Hromkla in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia where the patriarchal see was transferred to in 1151. His patrons included Catholicos Constantine I, king Hethum I, his wife Isabella, their children and prince Levon, in particular.Der Nersessian, 51 The colophons in Roslin‚Äôs manuscripts permit scholars to partially reconstruct the world in which he lived in. In these colophons Roslin appears as a chronicler, who preserved facts and events of his time. In his earliest surviving manuscript the Zeytun Gospel of 1256, Roslin signed his name as \\"Toros surnamed Roslin\\".Azarian, 323 Only Armenians of noble origin had a surname in the Middle Ages; however, the surname of Roslin does not figure among the noble Armenian families.Professor Charles Dowsett pointed to similarities with the Middle High German word roeslin meaning small rose. See: Roslin may have been an offspring of one of the marriages common between Armenians and Franks (any person originating in Catholic western Europe) that were frequent among the nobility but occurred among the lower classes as well. Roslin also names his brother Anton and asks the readers to recall the names of his teachers in their prayers. Hromkla was located in the eastern part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.Professor Levon Chookaszian, head of the Chair of UNESCO and Chair of Armenian Art History at Yerevan State University, proposed a more detailed explanation of the appearance of this surname in the Armenian milieu. According to the professor, the surname Roslin originated from Henry Sinclair of the Clan Sinclair, baron of Roslin who accompanied Godfrey of Bouillon in the 1096 Crusade to Jerusalem. Chookaszian‚Äôs hypothesis is based on the assumption that like most prominent Crusaders of the time,Godfrey‚Äôs brother Baldwin married Arda of Armenia, his successor Baldwin of Bourcq married Morphia of Melitene, Joscelin I married Beatrice etc. See: Sinclair married an Armenian. The approximate dates of Roslin's birth and death can be determined using the dates of his manuscripts. Based on the following it can be assumed that Roslin was at least 30 in 1260. At the time one could only achieve the level of mastery displayed in the Zeytun Gospel of 1256 no earlier than in their mid twenties. In the colophon of the Gospel of 1260, Roslin mentions that he has a son, indicating that he was likely a priest since a monk would have no children while a member of the laity would likely not have been an illuminated manuscript painter. By the time of the Gospel of 1265, Roslin already had his own apprentices. Roslin painted two portraits of prince Levon, the earliest of which was executed in 1250The miniature decorates a parchment folio currently within MS No. 8321 in Matenadaran. See: (the prince was born in 1236) and the second in 1262 showing the prince with his bride Keran of Lampron. Roslin's name isn't seen on any manuscript dated after 1286 and he most likely died in the 1270s.Azarian, 329 None of Roslin's contemporaries or his pupils refer to him in their work and in the following centuries, his name is only mentioned once when the scribe Mikayel working in Sebastea in the late 17th century found in his monastery a gospel book illustrated in 1262 by the \\"famous scribe Roslin\\" which he later copied. Manuscripts Fiery furnace (Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego), Mashtots, 1266 (MS No. 2027, Fol. 14 V.) =Signed by Toros Roslin= Seven manuscripts have been preserved that bear the signature of Roslin, they are made between 1256 and 1268 five of which are copied and illustrated by Roslin.Azarian, 322 Of these four are owned by the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem located in the Cathedral of St. James. These include the Gospel of 1260 (MS No. 251) copied for Catholicos Constantine I.Der Nersessian, 52 The Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 2660) was commissioned by Prince Levon, during the reign of King Het‚Äôum (I, 1226-1270),copied at Sis by the scribe Avetis, illustrated by Roslin at Hromkla and bound by Arakel Hnazandents.The amount of work it took to copy and illustrate the Sebastia gospel which was completed in the same year is probably the reason why the copying of the manuscript was assigned to the scribe Avetis. Der Nersessian, 52 The Gospel of 1265 (MS No. 1965) was copied for the daughter of Constantine of Lampron, lady Keran who after the death of her husband Geoffrey, lord of Servandakar, retired from the world.Der Nersessian, 53 Mashtots (MS No. 2027) was commissioned in 1266 by bishop Vartan of Hromkla, copied by Avetis who had previously collaborated with Roslin in 1262 at Sis and illustrated by Roslin at Hromkla. The Sebastia Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 539) is located in Baltimore's Walters Art Museum. It was copied for the priest Toros, nephew of Catholicos Constantine I. Written in uncials it is the most lavishly decorated among the signed works of Roslin. The manuscript was kept in Sivas since the 17th century where it remained until the deportation of Armenians in 1919. Ten years later it was purchased by American rail magnate Henry Walters in Paris, whose long standing interest in Armenian art was rekindled by the tragic events of the previous decade. His wife Sadie Walters donated the manuscript to the Walters Art Museum in 1935.Johnston, 203 The Zeytun Gospels of 1256 (MS. 10450), copied for Catholicos Constantine I {See link }and the Malatia Gospel of 1268 (MS No. 10675) are located at the Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts in Yerevan. The manuscript (formerly MS No. 3627) was presented to Catholicos Vazgen I as a gift by Archbishop Yeghishe Derderian, patriarch of Jerusalem. The Catholicos in turn gave the manuscript to the institute. The manuscript was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for the young prince and future king Hethum.Der Nersessian, 53-54 In the colophons of the manuscript Roslin describes the brutal sack of the Principality of Antioch by the Mamluk Sultan Baibars: \\"...at this time great Antioch was captured by the wicked king of Egypt, and many were killed and became his prisoners, and a cause of anguish to the holy and famous temples, houses of God, which are in it; the wonderful elegance of the beauty of those which were destroyed by fire is beyond the power of words.\\"Hazard, 137 =Canon tables and ornaments= The principal innovation of Roslin in regards to ornaments within canon tables is the addition of bust portraits.Der Nersessian, 75 In the Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 2660), Eusebius and Carpianus are represented as full figures standing in the outer margins of the Letter of Eusebius. Roslin also represented prophets such as David, Moses and John the Baptist.Der Nersessian, 64 This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables as early as the 6th-century Syriac Rabbula Gospels, their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies.Der Nersessian, 65 New zoomorphic creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds. On the first page of each gospel and the beginning of pericopes floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.Der Nersessian, 76 =Attributions= The Portrait of Prince Levon, Yerevan, Matenadaran, No. 8321 Several contemporary manuscripts from the 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes been attributed to Roslin. MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at Nor Nakhichevan and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions passant in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are much closer to the ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s.Der Nersessian, 54 Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty- eight vellum leaves from the Gospel of John have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in Vaspurakan. The priest Hovhannes who salvaged the remains of the old manuscript reports in one of the colophons that he had suffered seeing the old manuscript fall into the hands of the \\"infidels\\" like \\"a lamb delivered to wolves\\" and that he renovated it so that the \\"royal memorial written in it might not be lost\\". Part of the original colophons, the \\"royal memorial\\" reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum. The uncials are identical to that of MS 539 and similar marginal ornaments adorn both.Der Nersessian, 55 Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: \\"Lord bless the baron Vassak\\" and again on the upper band of the frame around the Raising of Lazarus: \\"Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel\\". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458.Der Nersessian, 55-56 Prince Vassak was sent to Cairo by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon and thousands of other hostages captured after the disastrous Battle of Mari. They returned home on June 24, 1268. At this time Roslin had already completed the copy and illustrations of MS 10675 and his chief patron, Catholicos Constantine I having died, Roslin would have been free to work for another patron such as prince Vassak who had a reason to celebrate.Der Nersessian, 56 Iconography Among Roslin's various miniatures on the theme of the Nativity, the Nativity scene of the Gospel of 1260 (MS No. 251) stands out the most. Mary and the Child are presented seated on the throne near a grotto combined with in the lower angle with the portrait of Matthew the Evangelist, in reverse proportional correlation. The combination of the two scenes was originally developed in Constantinople during the Comnenian era and reinterpreted by Roslin. Another unique attribute of this composition is seen in the top right corner where the bodyguards of the Magi, who are mentioned in apocryphal gospel accounts as soldiers who accompanied the Magi, are represented as Mongols. Art historian Sirarpie Der-Nersessian suggests that Roslin, \\"bearing in mind that the Magi came from the East, ...has represented the bodyguards with the facial type and costume of the Oriental peoples best known to him, namely the Mongols, the allies of king of Cilicia [Hethum I].\\" Legacy Sirarpie Der-Nersessian devoted the longest chapter in her posthumously published magnum opus Miniature Painting in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia to Toros Roslin whose work she had researched for years. In the chapter she underlines: \\"Roslin's ability to convey deep emotion without undue emphasis,\\" and in describing one of Roslin's scenes she extols: \\"The compositional design, the delicate modeling of the individual figures, and the subtle color harmonies show Roslin‚Äôs work at its best, equaling in artistic quality some of the finest Byzantine miniatures.\\"Kouymjian, D., \\"Sirarpie Der Nersessian (1896-1989).

Ecclesiastical history The first known Bishop of Vence is Severus, bishop in 439 and perhaps as early as 419. Among others are: Veranus, son of St. Eucherius, Archbishop of Lyon and a monk of L√©rins, bishop before 451 and at least until 465; St. Lambert, first a Benedictine monk (died 1154); Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1505‚Äì11). Antoine Godeau, Bishop of Grasse, was named Bishop of Vence in 1638; the Holy See wished to unite the two dioceses. Meeting with opposition from the chapter and the clergy of Vence Godeau left Grasse in 1653, to remain Bishop of Vence, which see he held until 1672. The diocese of Nice now unites the three former Dioceses of Nice, Grasse and Vence. A pizzeria operated from the back of a van in the centre of Vence. Sights Within the historic village, a medieval walled village, there are numerous interesting sights and monuments. The Peyra Gate was remodelled in 1810. The fountain was rebuilt in 1822 replacing an older one dating from 1578. Nearby is an ash tree, donated by Fran√ßois I and planted in 1538. The castle is today the Fondation √âmile Hugues, a modern and contemporary art museum. The cathedral was built in the 4th century on the site of a Roman temple. The stone of the western fa√ßade dates from 239. Another, on the right, was engraved in December 220. Other stones in the external walls represent funerary dedications. Also on the western side of the church, the Pierre du Tauroble evokes the cult of Cybele and also the Great mother of the Gods of Mount Ida. A chapel in the cathedral has a mosaic by Marc Chagall, dated 1979. The rue des Portiques is a section of the old Roman road.Itin√©raire d√©couverte de la Cit√© Historique, Office de Tourisme de Vence 2011 The town has a small chapel, up above the Cit√© Historique Chapelle du Rosaire (1948, completed in 1951), decorated with stained glass and other fittings by Henri Matisse, who owned a home in the village towards the end of his life.

It is used in conjunction with an alidade, usually positioned 1000 ft (304.8 m) away and wherever possible set at the same level. The projector is normally set at 90¬∞, although 71¬∞ 31' may be used, in relation to the terrain. The projector consists of a 430 W incandescent bulb set in a weatherproof housing. Inside the housing are two mirrors; the first, above the bulb, reflects the light downwards to the second mirror, that then reflects the light upwards to the cloud. Both mirrors are focused to produce a high intensity beam of light that renders a visible spot on the base of the cloud. The alidade is mounted on a post at a height of 5 ft (1.524 m) from the ground. It consists of an arm with a pointer and open sight at one end and a rubber eyepiece at the other. The arm is mounted onto a curved scale that is marked both in meters and the coded cloud height (feet). The observer looks through the eyepiece and sets the sight onto the spot projected on the cloud and reads the height from the attached scale. When the cloud is thin the beam of light may penetrate into the cloud. The observer should read the scale where the light first enters the cloud and not at the top. However, a remark may be made as to how far into the cloud the light was able to penetrate as this may be useful. In the case of fog or blizzard conditions the observer should read the scale where the beam disappears.

Use in crime and mass shootings  Canadian Beretta Cx4 Storm with 19-inch barrel and Bushnell MP red dot sight In Canada, the Cx4 Storm was the primary weapon used in the 2006 Dawson College shooting. The restricted class firearm had been acquired legally, and a coroner's inquest into the shooting recommended that all semi- automatic rifles be banned in Canada. The Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act passed in 2015 did not include a provision for such a ban. Sales of the CX4 Storm increased in Canada following the shooting, and in 2011, Beretta introduced a non-restricted (19\\" barrel) variant of the Cx4, making it more accessible. On May 1, 2020, the Canadian government reclassified the CX4 Storm (in all its variants) to be prohibited firearms.

It was split off from the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1286 in the course of an estate division among members of the ruling House of Welf. In 1495 the G√∂ttingen lands were incorporated as integral part of the newly established Brunswick Principality of Calenberg, with which they stayed united until the territory was merged into the Electorate of Hanover. Geography The principality covered the southern part of the Welf domains in the former Duchy of Saxony after the deposition of Duke Henry the Lion in 1180 (roughly corresponding to present-day South Lower Saxony). When in 1235 Emperor Frederick II had the Welf allodial lands restored as the Duchy of Brunswick- L√ºneburg, the ducal estates also comprised the lands on the Weser river, from Lauenf√∂rde up to M√ºnden and the border with the Franconian lands of Hesse; as well as the Leine banks from G√∂ttingen up to Northeim and Einbeck. The territory was separated from the northern Welf principalities of L√ºneburg and Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel by the estates of the Hildesheim prince-bishops. History The G√∂ttingen territory had already belonged to the allodial possessions of the Welf count palatine Henry the Elder in the early 13th century. After the death of the first Brunswick-L√ºneburg duke Otto the Child in 1257, his sons Albert the Tall and John inherited their father's territories. Duke Albert initially governed for his brother, who then was still a minor. H. B√ºnting: G√∂ttingen from the west, woodcut, 1585 When John came of age in 1267, the brothers finally agreed to divide the territory between them, the first step of a centuries-long fragmentation of the Brunswick-L√ºneburg duchy. Effective from 1269, the territories around the cities of Wolfenb√ºttel and G√∂ttingen in the south went to Albert, then ruling Prince of Wolfenb√ºttel. They were inherited by his sons Henry the Admirable, Albert II the Fat and William in 1279. When in 1286 the brothers again divided their heritage, Albert II chose G√∂ttingen as his residence and moved into the Welf residency, which he rebuilt into a fortress. After his brother William had died in 1292, he was also able to acquire the subdivision around Wolfenb√ºttel against his elder brother Henry, who only retained the Principality of Grubenhagen. After Albert the Fat's death in 1318, G√∂ttingen passed to his eldest son Otto the Mild, who governed over both the \\"Principality of G√∂ttingen\\" and the territory of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. These dukes joined G√∂ttingen and surrounding towns in battles against aristocratic knights in the surroundings of G√∂ttingen, in the course of which the citizens of G√∂ttingen succeeded in destroying the fortress of Grone between 1323 and 1329, as well as the fortress of Rosdorf. Since Otto the Mild died in 1344 without leaving children, his younger brothers Magnus the Pious and Ernest divided the land between themselves. Ernest I received G√∂ttingen, the poorest of all the Welf principalities, which was to remain separate from Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel for centuries. At this time, the territory consisted of the regions formerly owned by the Counts of Northeim, the towns of G√∂ttingen, Uslar, Dransfeld, M√ºnden, Gieselwerder at the border with Hesse and half of Moringen. Not much is known about the rule of Duke Ernest I but it is generally assumed that he continued to fight against aristocratic knights. Ernest I was succeeded after his death in 1367 by his son Otto I of G√∂ttingen (the Evil; German: der Quade) (d 1394), who initially lived in the city's fortress and attempted to make it a permanent Welf residency. The epithet the Evil came from Otto I's incessant feuds. Breaking with the policies of his predecessors, he frequently aligned himself with the aristocratic knights of the neighborhood in battles against the cities, whose growing power disturbed him. Under Otto the Evil G√∂ttingen gained a large degree of independence. After losing control of the provincial court at the Leineberg in to G√∂ttingen in 1375, Otto finally tried to impose his influence on G√∂ttingen in 1387, but with little success. In April 1387 G√∂ttingen's citizens stormed and destroyed the fortress within the city walls. In retaliation, Otto destroyed villages and farms in the town's surroundings. However, G√∂ttingen's citizens gained a victory over the Duke's army in a battle between the villages of Rosdorf and Grone, under their leader Moritz of Uslar, forcing Otto to acknowledge the independence of the town and its surrounding properties. 1387 thus marks an important turning point in the history of the town. G√∂ttingen's relative autonomy was further strengthened under Otto's successor Otto II \\"the One- eyed\\" of G√∂ttingen (), not least because the Welf line of Brunswick-G√∂ttingen died out with Otto II, and the resulting questions surrounding his succession after his abdication in 1435 destabilized the regional aristocracy. The trend towards ever diminishing Welf influence over the town continued until the end of the 15th century, although the town officially remained a Welf property. Nevertheless, it is counted in some contemporaneous documents among the Imperial Free Cities. The G√∂ttingen branch of the Welf dynasty became extinct, when Duke Otto II the One-Eyed died without male heirs in 1463. His territories were inherited by his cousin Duke William the Victorious, then Prince of Calenberg. After William had also inherited the Principality of Wolfenb√ºttel in 1473, he gave G√∂ttingen to his eldest son William IV. When in 1482 William IV succeeded his father as Prince of Wolfenb√ºttel both territories were once again ruled in personal union, though only for a short time, as in 1491 he ceded Wolfenb√ºttel to his eldest son Henry IV the Evil and finally incorporated G√∂ttingen as an integral part of the Principality of Calenberg, which he gave to his second son, Duke Eric I \\"the Elder\\" in 1495. The town of G√∂ttingen refused to pay homage to Eric I in 1504, and as a result, Eric I had Emperor Maximilian I declare the city outlawed. The subsequent tensions economically weakened G√∂ttingen, leading to the town finally paying its homage to Eric I in 1512. Afterward the relationship between Eric and the town improved, because of Eric's financially dependence on G√∂ttingen. With the Calenberg principality, G√∂ttingen again came into possession of the Welf dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1584. Devastated in the Thirty Years' War under the rule of Duke Frederick Ulrich and his brother (\\"the mad\\") Christian, it passed to Duke George of the L√ºneburg-Celle line in 1634, whose descendants ruled it thenceforth. Under the rule of Duke Ernest Augustus, in 1692, it was named as part of the indivisible territory of the Electoral state of Hanover.

Biocatalysis utilizes these biological macromolecules to catalyze small molecule transformations. Biocatalysis refers to the use of living (biological) systems or their parts to speed up (catalyze) chemical reactions. In biocatalytic processes, natural catalysts, such as enzymes, perform chemical transformations on organic compounds. Both enzymes that have been more or less isolated and enzymes still residing inside living cells are employed for this task. Modern biotechnology, specifically directed evolution, has made the production of modified or non- natural enzymes possible. This has enabled the development of enzymes that can catalyze novel small molecule transformations that may be difficult or impossible using classical synthetic organic chemistry. Utilizing natural or modified enzymes to perform organic synthesis is termed chemoenzymatic synthesis; the reactions performed by the enzyme are classified as chemoenzymatic reactions. History Biocatalysis underpins some of the oldest chemical transformations known to humans, for brewing predates recorded history. The oldest records of brewing are about 6000 years old and refer to the Sumerians. The employment of enzymes and whole cells have been important for many industries for centuries. The most obvious uses have been in the food and drink businesses where the production of wine, beer, cheese etc. is dependent on the effects of the microorganisms. More than one hundred years ago, biocatalysis was employed to do chemical transformations on non-natural man-made organic compounds, with the last 30 years seeing a substantial increase in the application of biocatalysis to produce fine chemicals, especially for the pharmaceutical industry. Since biocatalysis deals with enzymes and microorganisms, it is historically classified separately from \\"homogeneous catalysis\\" and \\"heterogeneous catalysis\\". However, mechanistically speaking, biocatalysis is simply a special case of heterogeneous catalysis. Advantages of chemoenzymatic synthesis -Enzymes are environmentally benign, being completely degraded in the environment. -Most enzymes typically function under mild or biological conditions, which minimizes problems of undesired side-reactions such as decomposition, isomerization, racemization and rearrangement, which often plague traditional methodology. -Enzymes selected for chemoenzymatic synthesis can be immobilized on a solid support. These immobilized enzymes demonstrate very high stability and re-usability and can be used to conduct reactions in continuous mode in microreactors. -Through the development of protein engineering, specifically site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution, enzymes can be modified to enable non-natural reactivity. Modifications may also allow for a broader substrate range, enhance reaction rate or catalyst turnover. -Enzymes exhibit extreme selectivity towards their substrates. Typically enzymes display three major types of selectivity: *Chemoselectivity: Since the purpose of an enzyme is to act on a single type of functional group, other sensitive functionalities, which would normally react to a certain extent under chemical catalysis, survive. As a result, biocatalytic reactions tend to be \\"cleaner\\" and laborious purification of product(s) from impurities emerging through side-reactions can largely be omitted. *Regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity: Due to their complex three-dimensional structure, enzymes may distinguish between functional groups which are chemically situated in different regions of the substrate molecule. *Enantioselectivity: Since almost all enzymes are made from L-amino acids, enzymes are chiral catalysts. As a consequence, any type of chirality present in the substrate molecule is \\"recognized\\" upon the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Thus a prochiral substrate may be transformed into an optically active product and both enantiomers of a racemic substrate may react at different rates. These reasons, and especially the latter, are the major reasons why synthetic chemists have become interested in biocatalysis. This interest in turn is mainly due to the need to synthesize enantiopure compounds as chiral building blocks for Pharmaceutical drugs and agrochemicals. Asymmetric biocatalysis The use of biocatalysis to obtain enantiopure compounds can be divided into two different methods: # Kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture # Biocatalyzed asymmetric synthesis In kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture, the presence of a chiral object (the enzyme) converts one of the stereoisomers of the reactant into its product at a greater reaction rate than for the other reactant stereoisomer. The stereochemical mixture has now been transformed into a mixture of two different compounds, making them separable by normal methodology. Scheme 1. Kinetic resolution Biocatalyzed kinetic resolution is utilized extensively in the purification of racemic mixtures of synthetic amino acids. Many popular amino acid synthesis routes, such as the Strecker Synthesis, result in a mixture of R and S enantiomers. This mixture can be purified by (I) acylating the amine using an anhydride and then (II) selectively deacylating only the L enantiomer using hog kidney acylase. These enzymes are typically extremely selective for one enantiomer leading to very large differences in rate, allowing for selective deacylation. Finally the two products are now separable by classical techniques, such as chromatography. 449x449px The maximum yield in such kinetic resolutions is 50%, since a yield of more than 50% means that some of wrong isomer also has reacted, giving a lower enantiomeric excess. Such reactions must therefore be terminated before equilibrium is reached. If it is possible to perform such resolutions under conditions where the two substrate- enantiomers are racemizing continuously, all substrate may in theory be converted into enantiopure product. This is called dynamic resolution. In biocatalyzed asymmetric synthesis, a non-chiral unit becomes chiral in such a way that the different possible stereoisomers are formed in different quantities. The chirality is introduced into the substrate by influence of enzyme, which is chiral. Yeast is a biocatalyst for the enantioselective reduction of ketones. Scheme 2. Yeast reduction The Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation is another example of a biocatalytic reaction. In one study a specially designed mutant of Candida antarctica was found to be an effective catalyst for the Michael addition of acrolein with acetylacetone at 20 ¬∞C in absence of additional solvent. Another study demonstrates how racemic nicotine (mixture of S and R-enantiomers 1 in scheme 3) can be deracemized in a one-pot procedure involving a monoamine oxidase isolated from Aspergillus niger which is able to oxidize only the amine S-enantiomer to the imine 2 and involving an ammonia‚Äìborane reducing couple which can reduce the imine 2 back to the amine 1. In this way the S-enantiomer will continuously be consumed by the enzyme while the R-enantiomer accumulates. It is even possible to stereoinvert pure S to pure R. Scheme 3. Enantiomerically pure cyclic tertiary amines  Photoredox enabled biocatalysis  Recently, photoredox catalysis has been applied to biocatalysis, enabling unique, previously inaccessible transformations. Photoredox chemistry relies upon light to generate free radical intermediates. These radical intermediates are achiral thus racemic mixtures of product are obtained when no external chiral environment is provided. Enzymes can provide this chiral environment within the active site and stabilize a particular conformation and favoring formation of one, enantiopure product. Photoredox enabled biocatalysis reactions fall into two categories: # Internal coenzyme/cofactor photocatalyst # External photocatalyst Certain common hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cofactors (NADPH and Flavin) can operate as single electron transfer (SET) reagents. Although these species are capable of HAT without irradiation, their redox potentials are enhance by nearly 2.0 V upon visible light irradiation. When paired with their respective enzymes (typically ene-reductases) This phenomenon has been utilized by chemists to develop enantioselective reduction methodologies. For example medium sized lactams can be synthesized in the chiral environment of an ene-reductase through a reductive, baldwin favored, radical cyclization terminated by enatioselective HAT from NADPH. The second category of photoredox enabled biocatalytic reactions use an external photocatalyst (PC). Many types of PCs with a large range of redox potentials can be utilized, allowing for greater tunability of reactive compared to using a cofactor. Rose bengal, and external PC, was utilized in tandem with an oxioreductase to enantioselectively deacylate medium sized alpha-acyl-ketones. Using an external PC has some downsides. For example, external PCs typically complicate reaction design because the PC may react with both the bound and unbound substrate. If a reaction occurs between the unbound substrate and the PC, enantioselectivity is lost and other side reactions may occur.

He taught in Beijing, Shanghai, Changsha and Hong Kong. The second son of Wu Chien-ch'√ºan, he was the grandson of the first teacher of Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan, Wu Ch'uan-y√º. Wu Kung-tsao was the younger brother of Wu Kung-i and the older brother of Wu Ying-hua. The Wu family were originally of Manchu ancestry. Biography As a young man, he studied t'ai chi ch'uan, along with his brother, under the supervision of Yang Shao-hou. There was a tradition in the Chinese martial arts that youngsters be taught by teachers of a generation older than their parents'. Since Wu Ch'uan-y√º had died the same year Wu Kung-tsao was born, he and his brother were taught by Yang Shao-hou, who was technically a generation senior to their father. Both Yang Shao-hou and Wu Chien-ch'√ºan were famous for their \\"small circle\\" martial expertise. The motions of t'ai chi ch'uan forms and pushing hands are all based on different sized circles, small circle movements in the forms and applications follow a more compact pathway for different leverage applications than larger circles. In the 1920s Wu Kung-tsao served first as an infantry officer in the Thirteenth Brigade of the Nationalist army until 1929, then later as a martial art instructor for the Hunan Martial Arts Training Centre as well as an instructor for the famous Ching Wu martial art school. During the 1930s, he wrote a well-known commentary on the classic writings in 40 chapters on t'ai chi ch'uan that his grandfather had inherited from Yang Pan-hou. His commentary (including the original 40 chapters) was published as Wu Chia T'ai Chi Ch'uan (Âê≥ÂÆ∂Â§™Ê•µÊã≥, Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan), also known by English speakers as The Gold Book because of the colour of its cover. In 1937, he established his family's first school in Hong Kong. In addition to his teaching and literary contributions to the art, Wu Kung-tsao became known as a specialist in the nei kung aspect of T'ai Chi training, both for martial purposes and for therapeutic interventions along the lines of traditional Chinese medicine. Wu Kung-tsao stayed on the mainland after the Chinese Communist takeover in 1949. During and for a short time after the Cultural Revolution of 1964-1978 he was imprisoned by the Red Guards due to his history as a Nationalist military officer, a traditional Confucian scholar and Taoist teacher as well as a hostage to ensure the \\"good behaviour\\" of the rest of his family who were at the time living in Shanghai and Hong Kong. He was routinely tortured while a prisoner but was finally released in 1979, when he moved again to Hong Kong.

The story focuses on the Japanese hell, where judgment is passed on the living. An original video animation, Magistrate of Darkness: Judge, based on the manga was released in 1991. Plot The OVA starts with a man being shot in a jungle-like scenery. It is later revealed that the person is Yamanobe, the vice-president of a company who sent him to South America, where he was killed by local guerrillas. The company he works for is the main center of the story and it is where all other major characters work. The main character, , is apparently an everyman, known as a silent guy by his workmates. However, in secret, he is the Judge of Darkness, punishing living criminals that were not found guilty by human laws. Two of Oma's workmates, Ryuichi Murakami and Koji Kawamata, are embezzling money from the company. To do it, Murakami seduced Yamamoto, a woman who works in the company accounting department. When an investigation about the case starts and a rumor that Yamamoto is the culprit starts to be spread, Yamamato is found hung in a rope. The police consider it as a suicide, but Oma, as the Judge of the Darkness, appears before Murakami and charges him for Yamamoto's murder. After killing Murakami, Oma starts to chase Kawamata, and he first makes a call simulating Yamanobe's voice. Soon after, a mysterious man, who proclaims himself to be a lawyer, appears before Kawamata. The man says Kawamata will need his help and puts a seal on Kawamata's hand right before Kawamata dispenses his aid. However, when Kawamata is caught in an Oma's trap and the seal saves him, he goes to contact the \\"Metaphysical Lawyer\\". The lawyer explains the dead can have a grudge against the living people. To resolve this problem, he goes with Kawamata to the mountains, where the lawyer fights with Oma and defeats the Judge of Darkness. However, through his girlfriend, Nanase, Oma evokes the \\"Hag of the Styx\\" to summon the Court of Ten Kings‚Äîthe ultimate court of the hell. Although Oma cannot prove Kawamata to be the culprit even by calling Yamanobe's soul, the guilty Kawamata ends up stumbling on Enma's mirror. The artifact reveals Kawamata had a secret discretionary fund in South America that controlled the guerillas who killed Yamanobe. Kawamata is ultimately strangled by his own reflection in the hell and is found dead in his office by Nanase.

By 2007, the DVD publication was discontinued and after CPM's bankruptcy in 2009 its license was liquidated. Reception Michael Toole of Anime News Network said he \\"just love[d] Judge\\", although he considered it \\"a particularly low-budget OVA catering to bored salarymen\\". Toole called it a \\"crude albeit satisfying revenge fantasy\\" that \\"fits in nicely with a viewing of Harvey Birdman episodes\\". A reviewer for Video Watchdog declared: \\"Highly competent animation and an engrossing story by Fujihiko Hosono make JUDGE a very worthwhile entertainment.\\" Fred Patten wrote for Cartoon Research that it was \\"better directed than most\\" under-an-hour OVAs, especially praising its \\"clever dialogue\\". On the other hand, Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Reviews dubbed it \\"an unmemorable OAV\\"; he wrote, \\"Judge should have been an interesting, if strange trip through a suspenseful world of intrigue. Instead, it is a mostly incoherent mash of the creepy, with a jumbled plot and unconvincing acting\\".

The role of the VDI in Germany is comparable to that of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in the United States or Engineers Australia (EA) in Australia barring the broader field of work of the VDI. The VDI is not a union. The association promotes the advancement of technology and represents the interests of engineers and of engineering businesses in Germany.VDI Website About the VDI History The organization was founded on May 12, 1856 by fellow researchers from the Academic Society H√ºtte, in the small town of Alexisbad, with the first journal officially being released to the public in 1857. In 1866 the VDI helped establish the predecessor of Technischer √úberwachungsverein, the Dampfkessel√ºberwachungsvereinen (English: Steam boiler inspection association). At the time, engineering was not regarded to be of the same ranking as scientific disciplines, which the VDI changed in 1899, with the re- categorisation of the Technische Hochschule as a type of University. In 1923 the VDI Verlag was founded, publishing monthly newspapers which are distributed to members. After the Second World War the VDI moved its headquarters from Berlin to D√ºsseldorf, where it remains now today. It also helped establish the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Kerntechnik (English: Society for Nuclear Technology) in 1956, which resulted in the German Atomforum, in 1959.

A seminal figure of the Silver Age of Russian Poetry, regarded{{by whom?}] as a co-founder of the Symbolist movement, Merezhkovsky ‚Äì with his wife, the poet Zinaida Gippius ‚Äì was twice forced into political exile. During his second exile (1918‚Äì1941) he continued publishing successful novels and gained recognition as a critic of the Soviet Union. Known both as a self-styled religious prophet with his own slant on apocalyptic Christianity, and as the author of philosophical historical novels which combined fervent idealism with literary innovation, Merezhkovsky became a nine-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in literature, which he came closest to winning in 1933. Biography Dmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky was born on August 2, 1866, in Saint Petersburg, the sixth son in the family. His father Sergey Ivanovich Merezhkovsky served as a senior official in several Russian local governors' cabinets (including that of I.D.Talyzin in Orenburg) before entering Alexander II's court office as a Privy Councillor.Mihaylov, Oleg. \\"The Prisoner of Culture\\". The Foreword to The Complete Work of D.S.Merezhkovsky in 4 volumes. 1990. Pravda Publishers. His mother Varvara Vasilyevna Merezhkovskaya (n√©e Tcherkasova) was a daughter of a senior Saint Petersburg security official. Fond of arts and literature, she was what Dmitry Merezhkovsky later remembered as the guiding light of his rather lonely childhood (despite the presence of five brothers and three sisters around). There were only three people Merezhkovsky had any affinity with in his whole lifetime, and his mother, a woman \\"of rare beauty and angelic nature\\" according to biographer Yuri Zobnin, was the first and the most important of them.Zobnin, Yuri. The Life and Deeds of Dmitry Merezhkovsky. 2008 // Moscow. ‚Äî Molodaya Gvardiya Publishers. Lives of Distinguished People series, issue 1091. pp.15‚Äì16 =Early years= Dmitry Merezhkovsky spent his early years on the Yelagin Island in Saint Petersburg, in a palace-like cottage which served as a summer dacha for the family. In the city the family occupied an old house facing the Summer Gardens, near Prachechny Bridge. The Merezhkovskys also owned a large estate in Crimea, by a road leading to the Uchan-Su waterfall. \\"Fabulous Oreanda palace, now in ruins, will stay with me forever. White marble pylons against the blue sea... for me it's a timeless symbol of Ancient Greece,\\" he wrote years later. Sergey Merezhkovsky, although a man of means, led an ascetic life, keeping his household 'lean and thrifty'. He saw this also as 'moral prophylactics' for his children, regarding luxury-seeking and reckless spending as the two deadliest sins. The parents traveled a lot, and an old German housekeeper Amalia Khristianovna spent much time with the children, amusing them with Russian fairytales and Biblical stories. It was her recounting of saints' lives that helped Dmitry to develop fervent religious feelings in his early teens.Zobnin, p.11 In 1876 Dmitry Merezhkovsky joined an elite grammar school, the St. Petersburg Third Classic Gymnasium. Years spent there he described later by one word, \\"murderous\\", remembering just one teacher as a decent person ‚Äì \\"Kessler the Latinist; well-meaning he surely never was, but at least had a kindly look.\\" At thirteen Dmitry started writing poetry, rather in the vein of Pushkin's \\"Bakhchisarai Fountain\\" as he later remembered. He became fascinated with the works of Moli√®re to such an extent as to form a Moli√®re Circle in the Gymnasium. The group had nothing political on its agenda, but still made the secret police interested. All of its members were summoned one by one to the Third Department's headquarters by the Politzeisky Bridge to be questioned. It is believed that only Sergey Merezhkovsky's efforts prevented his son from being expelled from the school. Debut Much as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced father, later he had to give him credit for being the first one to have noticed and, in his emotionless way, appreciate his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) \\"spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul\\" and encouraged him to soldier on.Zobnin, p.7 Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: \\"Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!\\" ‚Äì \\"Oh no, I'd rather he won't ‚Äì either suffer, or write well!\\", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye published two of his poems, \\"Little Cloud\\" and \\"The Autumn Melody\\". A year later another poem \\"Narcissus\\" was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.Zobnin, p.26 In Autumn 1882 Merezhkovsky attended one of the first of Semyon Nadson's public readings and, deeply impressed, wrote him a letter. Soon Nadson became Merezhkovsky's closest friend ‚Äì in fact, the only one, apart from his mother. Later researchers suggested there was some mystery shared by the two young men, something to do with \\"fatal illness, fear of death and longing for faith as an antidote to such fear.\\" Nadson died in 1887, Varvara Vasilyevna two years later; feeling that he's lost everything he'd ever had in this world, Merezhkovsky submerged into deep depression.Zobnin, p.81-82 In January 1883 Otechestvennye Zapiski published two more of Merezhkovsky's poems. \\"Sakya Muni\\", the best known of his earlier works, entered popular poetry recital compilations of the time and made the author almost famous. By 1896 Merezhkovsky was rated as \\"a well known poet\\" by the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. Years later, having gained fame as a novelist, he felt embarrassed by his poetry and, while compiling his first Complete series in the late 1900s, cut the poetry section down to several pieces. Nevertheless, Merezhkovsky's poems remained popular, and some major Russian composers, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky among them, have set dozens of them to music. University years In 1884‚Äì1889 Merezhkovsky studied history and philology at the University of Saint Petersburg where his PhD was on Montaigne. He learned several foreign languages and developed strong interest in the French literature, the philosophy of positivism, theories of John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. Still, his student years were joyless. \\"University gave me no more than a Gymnasium did. I've never had proper ‚Äì either family, or education,\\" he wrote in his 1913 autobiography. The only lecturer he remembered fondly was the historian of literature Orest Miller, who held a domestic literature circle.Zobnin, p.45 In 1884 Merezhkovsky (along with Nadson) joined the Saint Petersburg's Literary Society, on Aleksey Pleshcheyev's recommendation. The latter introduced the young poet to the family of Karl Davydov, head of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His wife Anna Arkadyevna became Merezhkovsky's publisher in the 1890s, their daughter Julia ‚Äì his first (strong, even if fleeting) romantic interest. In Davydov's circle Merezhkovsky mixed with well-established literary figures of the time ‚Äì Ivan Goncharov, Apollon Maykov, Yakov Polonsky, but also Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Gleb Uspensky, two prominent narodniks whom he regarded later as his first real teachers. It was under the guidance of the latter that Merezhkovsky, while still a University student, embarked upon an extensive journey through the Russian provinces where he met lots of people, notably religious cults leaders. He stayed for some time in Chudovo village where Uspensky lived, and both men spent many sleepless nights discussing things like \\"life's religious meaning,\\" \\"a common man's cosmic vision\\" and \\"the power of the land.\\" At the time he was seriously considering leaving the capital to settle down in some far-out country place and become a teacher. Another big influence was Mikhaylovsky, who introduced the young man to the staff of Severny Vestnik, a literary magazine he founded with Davydova. Here Merezhkovsky met Vladimir Korolenko and Vsevolod Garshin, and later Nikolai Minsky, Konstantin Balmont and Fyodor Sologub: the future leaders of the Russian Symbolism movement. Merezhkovsky's first article for the magazine, \\"A Peasant in the French literature\\", upset his mentor: Mikhaylovsky spotted in his young prot√©g√© the \\"penchant for mysticism,\\" something he himself was averse to.Zobnin, p.40 In the early 1888 Merezhkovsky graduated from the University and embarked upon a tour through the South of Russia, starting in Odessa. In Borjomi he met 19-year-old poet Zinaida Gippius. The two fell in love and on January 18, 1889, married in Tiflis, making arguably the most prolific and influential couple in the history of Russian literature. Soon husband and wife moved into their new Saint Petersburg house, Merezkovsky's mother's wedding present. =Late 1880s to early 1890s= Merezhkovsky's major literary debut came with the publication of Poems (1883‚Äì1888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but ‚Äì even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.Zobnin, p. 81 Having by this time lost interest in poetry, Dmitry Merezhkovsky developed a strong affinity to Greek drama and published translations of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides in Vestnik Evropy. These and some of his later translations from Ancient Greek (like prose version of Daphnis and Chloe, 1896), almost unnoticed by the contemporary critics, later came to be regarded (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) \\"the pride of the Russian school of classical translation.\\"Zobnin, p. 401 In the late 1880s Merezhkovsky debuted as a literary critic with an essay on Anton Chekhov entitled \\"A Newly-born Talent Facing the Same Old Question\\" and published by Severny Vestnik. Having spotted in his subject's prose \\"the seeds of irrational, alternative truth,\\" Merezhkovsky inadvertently put an end to his friendship with Mikhaylovsky and amused Chekhov who, in his letter to Pleshcheev, mentioned the \\"disturbing lack of simplicity\\" as the article's major fault.Zobnin, p. 402 Merezhkovsky continued in the same vein and thus invented (in retrospect) the whole new genre of a philosophical essay as a form of critical thesis, something unheard of in Russian literature before. Merezhkovsky's biographical pieces on Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Goncharov, Maykov, Korolenko, Pliny, Calderon scandalized the contemporary literary establishment. Later, compiled in a volume called The Eternal Companions, these essays were pronounced modern classics, their author praised as \\"the subtlest and the deepest of late XIX ‚Äì early XX Russian literary critics\\" by literary historian Arkady Dolinin. The Eternal Companions became so revered a piece of literary art in the early 1910s that the volume was officially chosen as an honorary gift for excelling grammar school graduates.Zobnin, p. 94 Merezhkovsky in 1890s. Portrait by Ilya Repin In May 1890 Liubov Gurevich, the new head of the revamped Severny Vestnik, turned a former narodnik's safe haven into the exciting club for members of the rising experimental literature scene, labeled \\"decadent\\" by detractors. Merezhkovsky's new drama Sylvio was published there, the translation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven followed suit. Other journals became interested in the young author too: Russkaya Mysl published his poem Vera (later included in his The Symbols compilation), hailed as one of the Russian Symbolism's early masterpieces, its colourful mysticism providing a healthy antidote to narodniks's \\"reflections\\" of the social life. Bryusov \\"absolutely fell in love with it,\\" and Pyotr Pertsov years later admitted: \\"For my young mind Merezhkovsky's Vera sounded so much superior to this dull and old-fashioned Pushkin\\".Zobnin, p. 57 Russkaya Mysl released The Family Idyll (Semeynaya idillia, 1890), a year later another symbolic poem Death (Smert) appeared in Severny Vestnik. In 1891 Merezhkovsky and Gippius made their first journey to Europe, staying mostly in Italy and France; the poem End of the Century (Konetz Veka) inspired by the European trip, came out two years later. On their return home the couple stayed for a while in Guppius' dacha at Vyshny Volochyok; it was here that Merezhkovsky started working on his first novel, The Death of the Gods. Julian the Apostate. A year later it was finished, but by this time the situation with Severny Vestnik had changed: outraged by Akim Volynsky's intrusive editorial methods, Merezhkovsky severed ties with the magazine, at least for a while. In the late 1891 he published his translation of Sophocles' Antigona in Vestnik Evropy, part of Goethe's Faustus (in Russkoye Obozrenye) and Euripides' Hyppolite (in Vestnik Evropy again). The latter came out in 1893, after the couple's second trip to Europe where their first encounter with Dmitry Filosofov occurred. Merezhkovsky's vivid impressions of Greece and the subsequent spurt of the new ideas provided the foundation for his second novel. The Symbolism manifests In 1892 Merezhkovsky's second volume of poetry entitled Symbols. Poems and Songs came out. The book, bearing E.A.Poe and Charles Baudelaire's influences but also tinged with the author's newly found religious ideas, became a younger readership's favourite. Of the elder writers only Yakov Polonsky supported it wholeheartedly.Zobnin, p. 104 In October 1892 Merezhkovsky's lecture \\"The Causes of the Decline of the Contemporary Russian Literature and the New Trends in it\\" was first read in public, then came out in print. Brushing aside the 'decadent' tag, the author argued that all three \\"streaks of Modern art\\" ‚Äî \\"Mystic essence, Symbolic language and Impressionism\\" ‚Äî could be traced down to the works of Lev Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky, Russian Modernism, therefore, being a continuation of the Russian literature's classic tradition. Coupled with Symbols, the lecture was widely accepted as Russian symbolism's early manifest. The general reaction to it was mostly negative. The author found himself between the two fires: liberals condemned his ideas as \\"the new obscurantism,\\" members of posh literary salons treated his revelations with scorn. Only one small group of people greeted \\"The Causes\\" unanimously, and that was the staff of Severny Vestnik, which welcomed him back.Zobnin, p. 400 In 1893‚Äì1894 Merezhkovsky published numerous books (the play The Storm is Over and the translation of Sophocles' Oedipus the King among them), but the money all this hard work brought were scant. Now writing his second novel, he had to accept whatever work was offered to him. In the late 1893 Merezhkovskys settled in Saint Petersburg again. Here they frequented the Shakespearean Circle, the Polonsky's Fridays and the Literary Fund gatherings. Then the pair started their own home salon with Filosofov and Akim Volynsky becoming habitu√©s. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky found that his debut novel was to be published in Severny Vestnik after all. What he didn't realise was that this came as a result of a Gippius' tumultuous secret love affair with Akim Volynsky, one of this magazine's chiefs.Zobnin, p. 106 =1895‚Äì1903= Gippius and Volynsky, 1890s The Death of the Gods which came out in 1895 (Severny Vestnik, Nos.1‚Äì6) opened the Christ & Antichrist trilogy and in retrospect is regarded as the first Russian symbolist novel. Sceptics prevailed (most of them denouncing the author's alleged Nietzscheanity), but the allies were ecstatic. \\"A novel made for eternity,\\" Bryusov marveled. Five years later Julian the Apostate was published in France, translated by Zinaida Vasilyeva. Merezhkovsky's relationship with Severny Vestnik, though, again started to deteriorate, the reason being Akim Volynsky's jealousy. In 1896 all three of them (husband still unaware of what was going on behind his back) made a trip to Europe to visit Leonardo da Vinci's places. Several ugly rows with Volynsky finally prompted Gippius to send her scandalous-minded lover home. Volynsky reacted by expelling his ex-lover's husband from Severny Vestnik (some sources say it was the Merezhkovskys who withdraw their cooperation with the \\"Severny Vestnik\\" a year before the magazine shut down in 1898, along with Minsky and Sologub), made sure the major literary journals would shut the door on him and published (in 1900) under his own name a monograph Leonardo da Vinci, written and compiled by his adversary.Zobnin, p. 400-404 The scandal concerning plagiarism lasted for almost two years. Feeling sick and ignored, Merezhkovsky in 1897 was seriously considering leaving his country for good, being kept at home only by the lack of money. For almost three years the second novel, Resurrection of Gods. Leonardo da Vinci (The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci ‚Äì in English and French) remained unpublished. It finally appeared in Autumn 1900 in Mir Bozhy under the title \\"The Renaissance\\". In retrospect these two books' \\"...persuasive power came from Merezhkovsky's success in catching currents then around him: strong contrasts between social life and spiritual values, fresh interest in the drama of pagan ancient Athens, and identification with general western European culture.\\" By the time of his second novel's release Merezhkovsky was in a different cultural camp ‚Äì that of Dyagilev and his close friends ‚Äì Alexandre Benois, Leon Bakst, Nikolay Minsky and Valentin Serov. Their own brand new Mir Iskusstva (World of Art) magazine, with Dmitry Filosofov as a literary editor, accepted Merezhkovsky wholeheartedly. It was here that his most famous essay, L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky was published in 1900‚Äì1901, coinciding with the escalation of Tolstoy's conflict with the Russian Orthodox church. Tolstoy invited the couple to his Yasnaya Polyana estate in 1904 and, to both parties' delight, the visit proved to be friendly. Behind the facade, there was little love lost between them; the old man confessed in his diary that, he just couldn't \\"force himself to love those two,\\" and Merezhkovsky's critique of what he saw as \\"Tolstoy's nihilism\\" continued. =The God-seekers and Troyebratstvo= In the early 1900s Merezhkovskys formed the group called the Religious-Philosophical Meetings (1901‚Äì1903) based on the concept of the New Church which was suggested by Gippius and supposed to become an alternative to the old Orthodox doctrine, \\"...imperfect and prone to stagnation.\\" The group, organized by Merezhkovsky and Gippius along with Vasily Rozanov, Viktor Mirolyubov and Valentin Ternavtsev, claimed to provide \\"a tribune for open discussion of questions concerning religious and cultural problems,\\" serving to promote \\"neo- Christianity, social organization and whatever serves perfecting the human nature.\\" Having lost by this time contacts with both Mir Iskusstva and Mir Bozhy, Merezhkovskys felt it was time for them to create their own magazine, as a means for \\"bringing the thinking religious community together.\\" In July 1902, in association with Pyotr Pertsov and assisted by some senior officials including ministers Dmitry Sipyagin and Vyacheslav von Plehve, they opened their own Novy Put (New Path) magazine, designed as an outlet for The Meetings. Troyebratstvo (Gippius, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov) in the early 1910s. Caricature by Re-Mi (Nikolai Remizov) After the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of the group (by this time known as Bogoiskateli, or God- seekers) were cancelled by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In Novy Put things changed too: with the arrival of strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it looked more like a literary circle than anything it had ever purported to be. The couple formed their own domestic \\"church\\", trying to involve miriskusniks. Of the latter, only Filosofov took the idea seriously and became the third member of the so-called Troyebratstvo (The Brotherhood of Three) built loosely upon the Holy Trinity format and having to do with the obscure 12th century idea of the Third Testament. Merezhkovsky developed it into the Church of the Holy Ghost, destined to succeed older churches ‚Äì first of the Father (Old Testament), then of the Son (New Testament). The services at Troyebratstvo (with the traditional Russian Orthodox elements organized into a bizarre set of rituals) were seen by many as blasphemy and divided the St. Petersburg intellectual elite: Vasily Rozanov was fascinated by the thinly veiled eroticism of the happening, Nikolai Berdyaev was among those outraged by the whole thing, as were the (gay, mostly) members of Mir Iskusstva. Sergei Diaghilev accused Filosofov of committing 'adultery'. The latter in 1905 settled down in Merezhkovskys' St. Petersburg house, becoming virtually a family member. In 1904 Peter and Alexis, the third and final novel of Christ and Antichrist trilogy was published (in Novy Put, Nos.1‚Äì5, 9‚Äì12), having at its focus the figure of Peter the Great as an \\"embodied Antichrist\\" ‚Äì an idea the author shared with Russian raskolniki. The novel's release was now eagerly anticipated in Europe where Merezhkovsky by this time has become a best- selling author, Julian the Apostate having undergone ten editions (in four years) in France. But when the Daily Telegraph described the novelist as \\"an heir to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky's legacy,\\" back in Russia critics denounced this praise so unanimously that Merezhkovsky was forced to publicly deny having had any pretensions of this kind whatsoever. =1905‚Äì1908= After the Bloody Sunday of January 9, 1905, Merezhkovsky's views changed drastically, the defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy by the Imperial Japanese Navy helping him see, as he put it, \\"the anti-Christian nature of the Russian monarchy.\\" The 1905 Revolution was now seen by Merezhkovsky as a prelude for some kind of a religious upheaval he thought himself to be a prophet of. The writer became an ardent supporter of the civil unrest, writing pro-revolutionary verse, organizing protest parties for students, like that in Alexandrinsky theatre. In October 1905 he greeted the government's 'freedoms-granting' decree but since then was only strengthening ties with leftist radicals, notably, esers. 200px In The Forthcoming Ham (Gryadushchu Ham, 1905) Merezhkovsky explained his political stance, seeing, as usual, all things refracted into Trinities. Using the pun (\\"Ham\\" in Russian, along with a Biblical character's name, meaning 'lout', 'boor') the author described the three \\"faces of Ham'stvo\\" (son of Noah's new incarnation as kind of nasty, God-jeering scoundrel Russian): the past (Russian Orthodox Church's hypocrisy), the present (the state bureaucracy and monarchy) and the future ‚Äì massive \\"boorish upstart rising up from society's bottom.\\" Several years on the book was regarded as prophetic by many. In spring 1906, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov went into a self-imposed European exile in order to promote what they termed \\"the new religious consciousness.\\" In France they founded Anarchy and Theocracy magazine and released a compilation of essays called Le Tsar et la Revolution.Merezhkovsky. D.S. Revolution and Religion. ‚Äî russianway.rchgi.spb.ru. ‚Äî 1907. In one of the articles he contributed to it, Revolution and Religion, Merezhkovsky wrote: \\"Now it's almost impossible to foresee what a deadly force this revolutionary tornado starting upwards from the society's bottom will turn out to be. The church will be crashed down and the monarchy too, but with them ‚Äî what if Russia itself is to perish ‚Äî if not the timeless soul of it, then its body, the state?\\" Again, what at the time was looked upon as dull political grotesque a decade later turned into grim reality. In 1908 the play about \\"the routinous side of the revolution,\\" Poppy Blossom (Makov Tzvet) came out, all three Troyebratstvo members credited as co-authors. It was followed by \\"The Last Saint\\" (Posledny Svyatoy), a study on Seraphim Sarovsky, this time Merezhkovsky's own work. More significant were two of his socio-political/philosophical essays, \\"Not Peace But Sword\\" and \\"In Sill Waters\\". In them, working upon his concept of \\"the evolutionary mysticism,\\" Merezhkovsky argued that revolution in both Russia and the rest of the world (he saw the two as closely linked: the first \\"steaming forward,\\" the latter \\"rattling behind\\") was inevitable, but could succeed only if preceded by \\"the revolution of the human spirit,\\" involving the Russian intelligentsia's embracing his idea of the Third Testament. Otherwise, Merezhkovsky prophesied, political revolution will bring nothing but tyranny and the \\"Kingdom of Ham.\\" Among people whom Merezhkovskys talked with in Paris were Anatole France, Rudolf Steiner, Bergson, leaders of the French Socialists. Disappointed by the general polite indifference to their ideas, husband and wife returned home in the late 1908, but not before Merezhkovsky's historical drama Pavel the First (Pavel Pervy) was published. Confiscated and then banned by the Russian authorities, it became the first part of the trilogy The Kingdom of the Beast (Tsarstvo zverya). Dealing with the nature and history of the Russian monarchy, the trilogy had little in common with the author's earlier symbolism-influenced prose and, cast in the humanist tradition of the 19th-century Russian literature, was seen later as marking the peak of Merezhkovsky's literary career. The second and the third parts of the trilogy, the Decembrists novels Alexander the First and December 14 came out in 1913 and 1918 respectively. =1909‚Äì1913= In 1909 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of another controversy after coming out with harsh criticism of Vekhi, the volume of political and philosophical essays written and compiled by the group of influential writers, mostly his former friends and allies, who promoted their work as a manifesto, aiming to incite the inert Russian intelligentsia into the spiritual revival. Arguing against vekhovtsys idea of bringing Orthodoxy and the Russian intellectual elite together, Merezhkovsky wrote in an open letter to Nikolay Berdyaev: > Orthodoxy is the very soul of the Russian monarchy, and monarchy is the > Orthodoxy's carcass. Among things they both hold sacred are political > repressions, the [ultra-nationalist] Union of Russian People, the death > penalty and meddling with other countries' international affairs. How can > one entrust oneself to prayers of those whose actions one sees as God-less > and demonic? Some argued Merezhkovsky's stance was inconsistent with his own ideas of some five years ago. After all, the Vekhi authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and ‚Äì following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-Vekhi tirade, his social status, too. Shunned by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov Bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book Sick Russia was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a \\"decadent pariah\\" any-more, suddenly turned a \\"well-established Russian novelist\\" and the \\"pride of the European literature.\\" Time has come for former friend Rozanov to write words that proved in the long run to be prophetic: \\"The thing is, Dmitry Sergeyevich, those whom you are with now, will never be with you. Never will you find it in yourself to wholly embrace this dumb, dull and horrible snout of the Russian revolution.\\" In the early 1910s Merezhkovsky moved to the left side of the Russian cultural spectrum, finding among his closest associates the esers Ilya Fondaminsky and, notably, Boris Savinkov. The latter was trying to receive from Merezhkovsky some religious and philosophical justification for his own terrorist ideology, but also had another, more down to Earth axe to grind, that of getting his first novel published.Zobnin, p.249 This he did, with Merezhkovsky's assistance ‚Äì to strike the most unusual debut of the 1910 Russian literary season. In 1911 Merezhkovsky was officially accused of having links with terrorists. Pending trial (which included the case of Pavel Pervy play) the writer stayed in Europe, then crossed the border in 1912 only to have several chapters of Alexander the First novel confiscated.Zobnin, p.254 He avoided being arrested and in September, along with Pirozhkov, the publisher, was acquitted. 1913 saw Merezhkovsky involved in another public scandal, when Vasily Rozanov openly accused him of having ties with the \\"terrorist underground\\" and, as he put it, \\"trying to sell Motherland to Jews.\\" Merezhkovsky suggested that the Religious and Philosophical Society should hold a trial and expel Rozanov from its ranks. The move turned to be miscalculated, the writer failing to take into account the extent of his own unpopularity within the Society. The majority of the latter declined the proposal. Rozanov, high-horsed, quit the Society on his own accord to respond stingingly by publishing Merezhkovsky's private letters so as to demonstrate the latter's hypocrisy on the matter.Zobnin, p.256 =1914‚Äì1919= For a while 1914 looked as though it was going to be the first ever relatively calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two Complete Works Of editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. THe Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made a conscious effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the most painless possible way.Zobnin, p.414 A couple of new plays by Merezhkovsky, Joy Will Come (Radost Budet) and The Romantics were staged in war-time Petrograd theaters. The latter was successful, hit, but for the mainstream critics its author remained a \\"controversial author.\\" \\"All in all, Russian literature is as hostile to me as it has always been. I could as well be celebrating the 25th anniversary of this hostility,\\" the author wrote in his short autobiography for Semyon Vengerov's biographical dictionary. 1917: February and October 1917 for Merezhkovskys started with a bout of political activity: the couple's flat on Sergiyevskaya Street looked like a secret branch of Russian Duma (that was when the seeds of a rumour concerning the couple's alleged membership in the Russian freemason community were sown). Merezhkovsky greeted the February anti-monarchy revolution and described the Kerensky-led Provisional government as \\"quite friendly.\\" By the end of the spring he had become disillusioned with the government and its ineffective leader; in summer he began to speak of the government's inevitable fall and the Bolshevik's tyranny coming. The late October saw Merezhkovsky's worst expectations coming to life.Zobnin, p.266 For Merezhkovsky the October Socialist revolution was a catastrophe. He saw it as the Coming of Ham he wrote about a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), the political and social incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of the first thing the Soviet government did was lift the ban from the anti-monarchist Pavel Pervy play and it was staged in several of Red Russia's theaters. For a while Merezhkovskys's flat served as an esers' headquarters but this came to an end in January 1918 when the so-called Uchredilovka was dissolved by Vladimir Lenin. In his 1918 diary Merezhkovsky wrote: In 1919, having sold everything including dishes and extra clothes, Merezhkovskys started collaborating with Maxim Gorky's new World Literature publishing house, receiving salary and food rations. \\"Russian Communists are not all of them villains. There are well-meaning, honest, crystal clear people among them. Saints, almost. These are the most horrible ones. These saints stink of the 'Chinese meat' most,\\" Merezhkovsky wrote in his diary.Many people found it inexplicable that amidst mass hunger with no agricultural farms functioning suddenly lots of fresh veal would appear from time to time at market places, sold invariably by the Chinese. This 'veal' was widely believed to be human flesh: that of the 'enemies of the revolution', executed in the Cheka basements. After news started to filter through of Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin's consequent defeats, Merezhkovskys saw their only chance of survival in fleeing Russia. This they did on December 14, 1919, along with Filosofov and Zlobin (Gippius' young secretary), having obtained Anatoly Lunacharsky- signed permission \\"to leave Petrograd for the purpose of reading some lectures on Ancient Egypt to Red Army fighters.\\" =Merezhkovsky in exile= Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed first for Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give newspaper interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented: > The whole question of Russia's existence as such ‚Äî and it's non-existent at > the moment, as far as I am concerned, ‚Äî depends on Europe's recognizing at > last the true nature of Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact > that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it > does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, > not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the > moment of either Socialism or even the [proclaimed] dictatorship of > proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: > Lenin and Trotsky. Gippius, Filosofov and Merezhkovsky. Warsaw, 1920 In Warsaw Merezhkovsky did practical work for some Russian immigrant organizations, Gippius edited the literary section in Svoboda newspaper. Both were regarding Poland as a \\"messianic\\", potentially unifying place and a crucial barrier in the face of the spreading Bolshevist plague. In the summer of 1920 Boris Savinkov arrived into the country to have talks with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski: he engaged Merezhkovsky and Filosofov in the activities of the so-called Russian Evacuation committee (more of a White Army mobilization center) and introduced the writer to Pi≈Çsudski. On behalf of the Committee Merezhkovsky issued a memorandum calling the peoples of Russia to stop fighting the Polish army and join its ranks. The whole thing flopped, though, as Poland and Russia reached the armistice agreement. Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France, Filosofov staying in Warsaw to head the Savinkov-led Russian National committee's anti-Bolshevik propaganda department. In Paris Merezhkovsky founded the Religious Union (later Soyuz Neprimirimykh, the Union of the Unpacified), was holding lectures, contributed to Pavel Milyukov's Poslednye Novosty and Pyotr Struve's Osvobozhdenye newspapers, exposing what he saw as the Bolshevist lies and denouncing the \\"Kingdom of Antichrist.\\"Zobnin, p.313-315 It was becoming more and more obvious, though, that Merezhkovsky, backed only by the circle of friends, was in isolation, misunderstood by some, abhorred by others. His calling for the international intervention into Russia angered the left; rejecting the restoration of the Russian monarchy antagonized the right. His single ally at the time was Ivan Bunin; never sharing much personal affinity, the two men formed an alliance in their relentless anti-Soviet campaign. Besides, having maintained strong contacts with influential French politics lobbying the interests of the Russian immigrants, both ensured that the Russian writers should get some financial support from the French government. A couple of years later another sponsor was found in Tom√°≈° Masaryk who granted personal pensions to some prominent figures in the immigrant Russian writers' community.Zobnin, p.419-420 Merezhkovsky insisted upon severing all the International PEN's contacts with Communist Russia and cancelling French help for the victims of mass hunger in Russian Volga Region arguing, not unreasonably, that those in need will not ever see any of the money or food sent. He criticised the exiled Russian Constituent Assembly's communique which was, in his opinion, too conciliatory in tone. In 1922 the collection of articles and essays of the four authors (Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov contacts with whom have been restored, and Zlobin) came out under the title The Kingdom of Antichrist, the general idea of the book being that the 'Russian fires', globalist in their nature and intent, promise \\"either brotherhood in slavery or the end in a common grave\\" for the European nations.Terapiano, Yuri. Sundays at Merezhkovskys and The Green Lamp Group. Distant Shores. Portraits of Writers in Exile. Memoirs. ‚Äî Moscow, Respublica Publishing House, 1994. p. 21 In winter 1925 a small literary and philosophy circle was formed by Merezhkovsky and Gippius; two years later it was officially launched as the Green Lamp group. With the Novy Korabl (The New Ship) magazine of its own, the group attracted the whole of the Russian intellectual elite in exile and remained the important cultural center for the next ten years. \\"We are the Criticism of Russia as such, the latter's disembodied Thought and Conscience, free to judge its present and foresee its future,\\" wrote Merezhkovsky of the Green Lamp mission. In 1928 at the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia bestowed on Merezhkovsky the Order of Savva of the 1st Degree merited by his services for world culture. A series of lectures organised for Merezhkovsky and Gippius by the Serbian Academy signalled the launch of the Yugoslav-based \\"Russian Library\\" series, where the best works of Bunin, Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Alexander Kuprin, Aleksey Remizov, Konstantin Balmont, Ivan Shmelyov and Igor Severyanin came out over the next several years. Things started to deteriorate in the early 1930s; with the Czech and the French grants withdrawn and much feared Socialists rising high on the French political scene, Merezhkovskys looked southwards and found there a sympathizer in Benito Mussolini who took great interest in the work and views of a Russian writer, now a multiple Nobel Prize for literature nominee.Zobnin, p.327 Merezhkovsky's literary activities: 1925‚Äì1941 In the mid-1920s, disappointed by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history.Zobnin, p.422-423 Speaking of the first two of them, The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete (1925) and Messiah (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: \\"Many people think I am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What I use the Past for is only searching for the Future. The Present is a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past/Future, which is where I belong.\\"Zveno (The Link) magazine. March 16, 1925. Of the three fundamental books Merezhkovsky created in the late 1920s early 1930s another trilogy took shape, loosely linked by the concept of man's possible way to salvation. The Mystery of the Three: Egypt and Babylon (Prague, 1925) was followed by the Mystery of the West: Atlantis-Europe (Berlin, 1930), where the cherished Third Testament idea took an apocalyptic, Nietzschean turn. The third, Unfamiliar Jesus (1932, Belgrade), is seen in retrospect as the strongest of the three. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky, a prolific writer again, drifted into the focus of the Nobel Prize committee attention. From 1930 onwards Sigurd Agrell, professor of Slavic languages in Lund University, started to methodically nominate Merezhkovsky for the Prize, although, invariably (and rather frustratingly for both), in tandem with Ivan Bunin. In November 1932 Gippius in a letter to Vera Bunina expressed her opinion that Merezhkovsky had no chance of winning \\"because of his anti- Communist stance,\\" but the truth was, Bunin (no lesser a Communism-loather than his rival) wrote books that were more accessible and, generally, popular. Merezkovsky even suggested they should make a pact and divide the money should one of them ever win, but Bunin took seriously what was meant apparently as a joke and responded with outright refusal. He won the Prize in 1933.Zobnin, p.426 Agrell continued nominating Merezhkovsky up until his own death in 1937 (making eight such nominations, in all), but each year the latter's chances were getting slimmer. The books he produced in his latter years (like the compilation of religious biographies Faces of Saints: from Jesus to Nowadays and The Reformers trilogy, published posthumously) were not ground-breaking. Hard times and deepening troubles notwithstanding, Merezhkovsky continued to work hard until his dying day, trying desperately to complete his Spanish Mysteries trilogy; the last of the three pieces, the unfinished Little Theresa, was with him at his deathbed; he died literally with a pen in his hand.Zobnin, p.329 Merezhkovsky and the European dictators Although never a Russian nationalist, Merezhkovsky was a Russo-centric author and thinker, cherishing the idea of his country's unique and in many ways decisive place in the world culture in history. Never tiring of reiterating the \\"Russian plight is the problem of the world, not Russia\\" postulate, he was ever on the look-out for some \\"strong leader\\" who would be able to organize and successfully see through the anti-Communist crusade. For a while Merezhkovsky thought he had found his hero in Benito Mussolini who, having sponsored his book on Dante, had several lengthy talks with the Russian writer on politics, literature and art. Impressed, Merezhkovsky started to see his new friend almost as an incarnation of Dante. In a letter addressed to Mussolini, he wrote: > The best, the truest and the liveliest document on Dante is ‚Äî your > personality. To understand Dante one has to live through him, but only you > being around makes that possible. Two souls, his and yours, are merged into > one, Infinity itself bringing you two together. Visualize Mussolini in > contemplation, and it's Dante. Imagine Dante in action, and it's Mussolini. All the while Merezhkovsky was trying to convince Mussolini that it was the latter's mission to start the \\"Holy War against Russia\\" (the idea formed the basis of his article \\"Meeting Mussolini\\", published by Illustrated Russia in February 1937). Seeing his name frequently mentioned by the Italian press in connection with Merezhkovsky's bizarre suggestions made the Duce uneasy and he took a step back. Visiting Rome in summer 1937, Merezhkovsky had talks with the Italian Foreign Minister, but failed to meet Mussolini. Then came the disillusionment, and in October of the same year he was already speaking of how disappointed he was with the Italian leader's \\"petty materialism\\". He tried to contact General Francisco Franco, now seeing Spain as the last anti- Communist citadel of Europe - and failed. Thus Merezhkovsky's choice of the new European \\"heroes\\" narrowed down to Adolf Hitler.Zobnin, p.427 Merezhkovsky had never seen Fascism as an alternative to Communism. As early as 1930 he wrote of a doomed Europe stuck between the two \\"stores of explosives: Fascism and Communism\\", expressing hope that some day these two evils will somehow destroy one another. But the danger of the Fuhrer's possible subjugation of Europe was still the lesser evil for him - compared to possible Communist expansion. The \\"Hitler dilemma\\" was the only thing husband and wife ever disagreed on. Gippius hated and despised the Fuhrer, referring to him as \\"an idiot\\". Merezhkovsky thought he found a leader who'd be able to take the whole of Antichrist Kingdom upon himself, this outweighing for him such trivia as the fact that his own Joan of Arc (1939) was banned in Germany on the day of its release. In summer 1939 Paramount (in collaboration with the French Association des Auteurs de Films) bought Merezhkovsky's scenario The Life of Dante. The production was cancelled on September 1, as World War II broke out in Europe. On September 9, fleeing the air raids, the Merezhkovskys moved to Biarritz in the south of France, where they spent the next three months, communicating mainly with the French and the English military officers, but also with Irina Odoyevtseva and her husband Georgy Ivanov.Zobnin, p.385 On June 27 1940 the German Wehrmacht occupied Biarritz. Here in a hotel on August 14 the writer's 75th anniversary celebration was held, organized by a group of French writers, with some notable Russians like Pavel Milyukov, Ivan Bunin and Mark Aldanov invited. It was there that Merezhkovsky made comments which (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) were later presented by some memoirists as his \\"infamous German radio speech\\". Still, even Zobnin admits that there were reasons to regard Merezhkovsky as a Nazi sympathizer. In the autumn of 1941 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of his German admirers ‚Äì students, mostly, but army officers too. It was their German friends who helped the couple move back to Paris from Biarritz where they found themselves penniless and on the verge of homelessness. \\"Merezhkovsky flew up to the Nurnberg fires with the agitation of a newly born butterfly... By this time most of us stopped visiting them,\\" wrote , a Green Lamp group member. =The \\"infamous radio speech\\"= Exactly how and why did Merezhkovsky found himself on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) blamed her own secretary Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man to come to the studio in the early days of the Nazi invasion of the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled \\"Bolshevism and Humanity\\" is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for an anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was saying all through the 1920s and 1930s: > Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's > been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day > Russia has been ‚Äì and remains to this very day ‚Äì only a means to the end: > that of its conquering the whole world. \\"This is the end for us,\\" Gippius allegedly commented, disgusted and horrified. In the days to come, though, husband and wife (as those who knew them later attested) often expressed horror at the news of Nazis' atrocities on the Eastern front; according to Gippius' friend, poet Victor Mamchenko, Merezhkovsky far from supporting Hitler, in those days was actually condemning him. Biographer Zobnin doubts that Merezhkovsky appeared on German radio at all, noting that none of the memoirists who mentioned it had himself heard Merezhkovsky speaking on air. All of those \\"witnesses\\" invariably referred to the printed version of the \\"speech\\" published in 1944 by Parizhsky Vestnik. This document, according to Zobnin (the author of the first comprehensive Merezhkovsky biography published in Russia) was most certainly a montage fake, concocted by Nazi propagandists out of the 1939 unpublished essay The Mystery of the Russian Revolution (on Dostoyevsky's Demons novel), with bits and pieces thrown in. The researcher insists such a speech could not have been broadcast in the late June: the couple resided in Biarritz and for an elderly person to give everybody a slip and somehow get to Paris was hardly probable.Zobnin, p.383-384 Adding to the confusion is the well-documented fact that Merezhkovsky had already made one speech mentioning Hitler and Joan of Arc in one breath. It happened in August 1940 at his 75th-birthday celebration in Biarritz, and in a different context. In fact, his speech caused trouble because it was deemed too pro-Russian and anti-German. According to Teffi, one of the people present, ‚Äî Irina Odoyevtseva independently corroborated this. \\"He was going on about the Atlantis and its demise. For those who understood Russian it was obvious that what he meant was Germany's defeat and Russia's imminent victory, but the Germans never understood this and applauded,\\" she remembered.Kolonitskaya, –ê. All is Clean for a Clean Beholder. Talks with Irina Odoyevtseva. Moscow, 2001. P. 133. All this, according to Zobnin, makes the \\"infamous German radio speech\\" look very much like a Nazi propaganda myth, picked up first by Yuri Terapiano, then authenticated by numerous reiterations. Merezhkovsky's death For the last three months of his life Merezhkovsky was working continuously in the couple's Paris flat, trying to finish Little Theresa. On December 6 husband and wife returned from one of their regular walks and spent the evening, in Gippius' words, \\"arguing, as usual, about the Russia versus freedom dilemma.\\" Skipping both supper and his habitual evening cigarette, Merezhkovsky went to his room early. Next morning the maid called Gippius to tell her the man was in some kind of trouble. Merezhkovsky was sitting unconscious next to a cold fireplace. The doctor arrived in 15 minutes' time and diagnosed brain hemorrhage. In half an hour Merezhkovsky was pronounced dead. \\"...Me, I'm a worm, not man, slandered by humans, despised by peoples (Ps. 21, 7). But wrap itself into a chrysalis a hapless worm does only to break out as a shiny white, sunlight-like, resurrected butterfly,\\" these were his last written words found on a piece of paper on a table. The funeral service was held on December 10 in the Orthodox church of Saint Aleksandr Nevsky. Dmitry Merezhkovsky was buried at the Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery, with just several people attending the ceremony.Zobnin, p.385-388 Merezhkovsky's ideas Merezhkovsky's first adopted philosophical trend was the then popular positivism. Soon, disillusioned in this idea, although never rejecting it wholly, Merezhkovsky turned to religion. Seeds of this hybrid (European positivism grafted to what's been described as \\"the subjective idealism\\" of Russian Orthodoxy) sown on the field of literature study brought forth a brochure entitled \\"On the Causes of the Decline and the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature\\". This manifesto gave a burgeoning Russian Symbolist movement both ideology and the name as such: Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to speak of symbols as definitive means of cognizance in modern Art. In the center of this new train of thought was the notion of \\"rejecting the rational in favour of the intuitive\\" by means of exploiting what the author termed as \\"spirituality of a symbol,\\" seeing the latter as a perfect means of describing Reality, otherwise unfathomable. Only through a symbol, according to Merezhkovsky, one could get to an object's deeper meaning, whereas (quoting, as he did, Tyutchev) \\"thought, whilst being spoken, turns a lie\\": According to scholar D.Churakov, Merezhkovsky, pronouncing \\"the death of metaphysics\\" and putting forward the idea that only language of symbols could be an adequate instrument for discovering the modern world's pattern of meanings, was unwillingly following Auguste Comte, the difference being that the latter was employing these ideas in scientific fields, while the former proposed to use them in literature and criticism. =The Third Testament= Merezhkovsky's next and most fundamental step ahead as a self-styled modernist philosophy leader was taken in tandem with his young intellectual wife Zinaida Gippius who from the first days of their meeting started generating new ideas for her husband to develop. Thus the Third Testament theory was born, or rather revived, transplanted from its Middle Ages Italian origins into the early 20th century's Russian ambience. It was the Third Testament that formed the basis of the early 20th-century Russian New Religious Consciousness movement which in turn kick started the Religious-Philosophical Society into action, again Gippius producing basic ideas for her husband to formulate. Borrowing the original idea from Joachim of Fiore, a 12th-century theologist, Merezhkovskys created and developed their own concept of man's full-circle religious evolution. In it the Bible was seen as a starting point with God having taken two steps towards Man, for the latter to respond with the third, logically conclusive one. According to Merezhkovsky, the First (Divine Father's) and the Second (Divine Son's) Testaments could be seen only as preliminary steps towards the Third one, that of the Holy Ghost. With the first maintaining the Law of God and the second ‚Äì the Grace of God, what the third Testament should do is bring Liberation to the human race; the First Testament revealing God's power as the gospel Truth, the Second transforming the gospel Truth into Love, the Third translating Love into Liberation. In this last Kingdom \\"pronounced and heard will be ‚Äì the final, never before revealed name of the coming one: God the Liberator,\\" according to the author. Merezhkovsky saw the Third Testament as a synthesis of the two original revelations: that \\"about Earth\\" (pre-Christian beliefs) and that \\"about Heaven\\" (Christianity). The Mystery of the Holy Trinity, when resolved, should link three elements into a circle, the great \\"new Earth under the new Heavens,\\" as promised in the Book of the Apocalypse. As Rozanov put it, \\"Merezhkovsky's greatest innovation was this attempt to merge together the two ‚Äî the Christian and the Heathen ‚Äî poles of poignancy. To discover a 'tempting vice' in the greatest of virtues and the greatest of virtues in the tempting vice.\\" This New Trinity concept implied that the all-inviting Holy Ghost was not a sexless spirit, but a female entity. Sex and spirituality Human history, according to Merezhkovsky, was one ceaseless \\"battle of two abysses\\": the abyss of Flesh (as discovered by pre-Christians) and the abyss of Spirit (opened by Christianity's sexless asceticism). Pre- Christians celebrated flesh-driven sensuality at the expense of spirituality. Ascetic Christians brought about the rise of Spirit, at the expense of sex. Merezhkovsky declared the dialectical inevitability of thesis and antithesis' coming together, of the spiritual and the sexual poles uniting on a higher, celestial level. In his own words, \\"Being aware of myself in my body, I'm at the root of personality. Being aware of myself in the other one's body, I'm at the root of sex. Being aware of myself in all human bodies, I am at the root of unity\\". Noticing that one of the Aramaic languages translates Spirit as Rucha, a female entity, Merezhkovsky interpreted the Holy Trinity as Father and Son's unity in the higher being, their common godly Mother. It is the latter's Kingdom Come that the Third Testament was supposed to lead to. Seeing both God and man as intrinsically unisexual, Merezhkovsky regarded a male/female schism to be a symptom of imperfection, the cause for primal human being's fatal disintegration. In the modern times, according to Merezhkovsky, both monastic and ascetic Christianity will cease to exist. Art would not just adopt religious forms, but become an integral part of religion, the latter taken in broader concept. Human evolution as he saw it, would lead to merging of whatever had been polarized: sex and spirit, religion and culture, male and female, et cetera ‚Äî bringing about Kingdom Come, not 'out there', but 'here on Earth'. =Merezhkovsky and \\"religious anarchism\\"= Man's evolutional progress towards the Third Testament Kingdom Come will not be without some revolutionary upheavals, according to Merezhkovsky, will be strewn with \\"catastrophes\\", most of them dealing with the \\"revolution of Spirit.\\"Merezhkovsky, D.S. The Seven Humble Ones (Sem smirennykh). The Complete D.S.Merezhkovsky, Vol. XV. I.D.Sytin's Publishing house. Moscow, 1914 The consequence of such revolution would bring about gradual change in the nature of religion itself, the latter taking under its spacious wing not only man's sensual liberation but also the latter's \\"freedom of rebellion.\\" \\"We are human only as long as we're rebels,\\" Merezhkovsky insisted, expressing what some saw as a proto-existentialist idea. One result of the \\"revolution of Spirit\\" should be the severing of ties between state and religion, according to Merezhkovsky. \\"The Church ‚Äì not the old, but the new, eternal, universal one ‚Äì is as opposite to the idea of the state as an absolute truth is opposing an absolute lie,\\" he declared in an open letter to Berdyaev.Merezhkovsky, D.S. The New Religious Action. An Open Letter to N.A.Berdyayev. P. 168 B.Rozental, analyzing Merezhkovsky's political and religious philosophy, thus summed up the writer's position: \\"The Law amounts to violence... The difference between legitimate power that holds violence 'in reserve' and violence itself is but a matter of degree: sinful are both. Autocracy and murder are nothing more than the two extreme forms of exhibiting [criminal] power.\\" Interpreting the Biblical version of the human history as a sequence of revolutionary events, Merezhkovsky saw religion and revolution as inseparable. It is just that for a social revolution to succeed, spiritual revolution should always come one step ahead of it. In Russia the lack of the latter brought about the former's fiasco, with Antichrist taking hold of things, he argued. In the 1920s Merezhkovsky lost interest in the religious anarchism doctrine. In his later years he became close to ecumenical ideals, prophesying the Kingdom Come as a synthesis of \\"Peter, Paul and John's principles\\", that is, bringing Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox traditions together. Legacy Throughout his lifetime Dmitry Merezhkovsky polarized opinion in his native Russia, bringing upon himself both praise and scorn, occasionally from the same quarters. According to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Merezhkovsky became Russia's first ever \\"new-type, universal kind of a dissident who managed to upset just about everybody who thought themselves to be responsible for guarding morality and order\\": In the words of a modern biographer, \\"he will find his place in history alongside Marquis de Sade, Nietzsche and Henry Miller, those classics who only through being condemned and ostracized by the many could be approached and appreciated by the few.\\" \\"I was disliked and scolded in Russia, loved and praised abroad, but misunderstood, both here and there,\\" Merezhkovsky wrote in a letter to Nikolai Berdyaev. Merezhkovsky has been given credit for his exceptional erudition, the scientific approach to writing, literary gift and stylistic originality. Seen in retrospect as the first ever (and, arguably, the only one) Russian \\"cabinet writer of a European type,\\" Merezhkovsky was, according to Berdyayev, \\"one of the best-educated people in Saint Petersburg of the first quarter of the 20th century.\\" Korney Chukovsky, pondering on the dire state of the early 20th century Russia's cultural elite, admitted that \\"the most cultured of them all\\" was this \\"mysterious, unfathomable, almost mythical creature, Merezhkovsky\\". Anton Chekov insisted that the Russian Academy of Sciences should appoint Merezhkovsky its honorary academic, in as early as 1902. Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to formulate the basic principles of Symbolism and Modernism, as opposed to 'decadence', a tag he was battling with. Never aspiring to a leading role in the movement, he soon became, according to I. Koretskaya, \\"a kind of handy encyclopedia for the ideology of Symbolism,\\" which others \\"could borrow aesthetic, socio-historical and even moral ideas from.\\" Having added a new (\\"thought-driven\\") dimension to the genre of historical novel and turning it into a modern art form, Merezhkovsky influenced Andrey Bely and Aleksey Remizov, as well as Valery Bryusov, Aleksey N. Tolstoy, Mikhail Bulgakov and Mark Aldanov. It was Merezhkovsky who introduced such concepts as a \\"modernist novel\\" and a \\"symbolic historical novel\\" to the conservative Russian literature scene of the late 1890s. Merezhkovsky was praised as an engaging essayist and \\"a master of quote-juggling.\\" Some critics loathed the repetitiveness in Merezhkovsky's prose, others admired his (in a broad sense) musical manner of employing certain ideas almost as symphonic themes, which was new at the time. No less influential, even if so much more controversial, were Merezhkovsky's philosophical, religious and political ideas. Alongside the obvious list of contemporary followers (Bely, Blok, etc.; almost all of them later became detractors) deeply interested in his theories were political figures (Fondaminsky, Kerensky, Savinkov), psychologists (Freud), philosophers (Berdyaev, Rickert, Stepun), lawyers (Kowalewsky). Thomas Mann wrote of Merezhkovsky as of a \\"genius critic and specialist in a world psychology, second only to Nietzsche.\\" Notable other Germans influenced by Merezhkovsky included Arthur Moeller van den Bruck and Alfred RosenbergFritz Stern, The Politics of Cultural Despair: A Study in the Rise of Germanic Ideology p 190 UCP, Berkeley, 1974. . Later researchers noted Merezhkovsky's willingness to question dogmas and thwart tradition with disregard to public opinion, never shying controversy and even scandal. Crucial in this context (according to O.Dafier) was his \\"quest for ways of overcoming deep crisis which came as a result of the Russian traditionalist Church losing its credibility.\\" =Criticism= In Russia the general response to Merezhkovsky's literary, cultural and social activities was negative. His prose, even if on the face of it stylistically flawless and occasionally accessible, was, critics argued, an elitist thing unto itself, \\"hermetically closed for the uninitiated majority.\\" \\"Having isolated himself from the real life, Merezhkovsky built up the inner temple for his own personal use. Me-and-culture, me-and-Eternity ‚Äì those were his recurring themes,\\" wrote in 1911 Leon Trotsky. For all his scientifically strict, academic approach to the process of collecting and re-processing material, contemporary academia, with little exception, ridiculed Merezhkovsky, dismissing him as a gifted charlatan, bent on rewriting history in accordance with his own current ideological and philosophical whims. Due to his incorrigible, as many saw it, tendency towards inconsistency, Merezhkovsky's old allies were deserting him, while new ones approached him warily. Vasily Rozanov wrote in 1909: Another former friend, Minsky, questioned Merezhkovsky's credibility as a critic, finding in his biographies a tendency to see in his subjects only things that he wanted to see, skillfully \\"re-moulding questions into instant answers.\\" For all his religiosity, Merezhkovsky was never popular with either Russian Orthodox Church officials or the religious intellectual elite of the time, people like Sergey Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky and Lev Shestov fiercely denouncing his ideas and projects. Similarly, the reputation of a radical Social democrat hasn't made Merezhkovsky popular in the leftist literary camp. He was variously described as \\"an anti-literature phenomenon\\" (Viktor Shklovsky), \\"the greatest corpse in the Russian literature\\" (Ivanov-Razumnik) and \\"a book-worm\\", totally \\"foreign to all things human\\" (Korney Chukovsky).Zobnin, p. 80 The writer's work published in emigration was, according to the 1934 Soviet Literary encyclopedia \\"the telling example of the ideological degradation and cultural degeneration of the White emigres.\\" Maxim Gorky's verdict: \\"Dmitry Merezhkovsky, a well-known God-admirer of a Christian mode, is a small man whose literary activity is akin to that of a type-writer: each type is clear and well-read, but it's soul-less and boring,\\" served as a leitmotif of the Soviet literary officialdom's view on Merezhkovsky for decades. In the Soviet times the writer was (in the words of Alexander Men) \\"aggressively forgotten,\\" his works unofficially banned up until the early 1990s, when the floodgate of re-issues opened the way for serious critical analysis of Merezhkovsky's life and legacy.

Contents GURPS Alternate Earths presents six versions of Earth possessing alternate histories to that of our own world, as well as a number of less-detailed alternate settings scattered throughout the book in sidebars. Attention is given to the ways in which agents of the Infinity Patrol presented in GURPS Time Travel and their rivals from the mysterious parallel known as Centrum attempt to influence the course of history in each parallel. There is a sequel volume, GURPS Alternate Earths II, and the concept of the conflict between the Infinity Patrol and Centrum across the many parallel Earths was made central to the Fourth Edition of GURPS as the default setting in the Basic Set and in the supplement GURPS Infinite Worlds. =Dixie= Dixie posits an alternate history where the Southern filibuster William Walker, as President of Nicaragua, chose to protect Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company rather than turn on his tycoon supporter. Without Vanderbilt's opposition to his regime in this timeline, Walker was able to conquer Cuba and make his Nicaragua the most powerful nation in Latin America. During the American Civil War, Walker's ships ran the Union blockade and ensured that Southern troops were well- supplied, leading to their victory over Northern forces and the independence of the Confederate States of America. In turn, the United States allied themselves with Germany and took most of Canada from the Confederacy's British supporters while the Confederates absorbed Mexico and most of Central America. The \\"current year\\" in Dixie is 1985, with the world dominated by the U.S.A., the C.S.A., the moribund German Empire, the nascent Russian Republic, and the rapidly modernizing United Republic of India. Technology is somewhat more advanced than at the same date in our world, with personal hovercraft and supersonic transports commonplace, and the presence of nuclear-armed orbital weapons platforms and the juxtaposition of the progressive \\"Yankees\\" and the stratified \\"Southron\\" society adds to the tension caused by the \\"Long Drum Roll\\" (the U.S.A-C.S.A. analogue to the Cold War). =Reich-5= Reich-5 (so named because it was the fifth parallel world discovered by the Infinity Patrol in which Nazi Germany had won World War II) takes as its point of divergence from real history the successful assassination of president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt by Giuseppe Zangara in 1933. While vice president-elect John Nance Garner attempted to implement Roosevelt's New Deal, he was unable to unify the country. U.S. politics seesawed back and forth between radical left- and right-wing administrations under Henry Wallace and Charles Lindbergh, with the country as a whole mired in isolationism and a continuing Great Depression, while Germany and Japan fought and won World War II, conquering the Allies without American involvement. In 1944, following Japanese attacks against American targets across the Pacific, including Pearl Harbor and the West Coast, Vice President William Dudley Pelley seized control of the nation after the assassination of Republican president Charles Lindbergh; the German invasion of Canada in the following year gave Pelley an excuse to arrogate to himself dictatorial powers. His theft of the 1948 election from Robert Taft (running on a combined Republican/Democratic ticket) prompted a Second American Civil War that was ended by a Nazi invasion of the United States and their development and use of the atomic bomb in 1950 against American cities. The \\"current year\\" in Reich-5 is 1995. Greater Germany dominates Europe, Africa, and India, while the U.S.A. is little more than a puppet state of Nazi Germany, with a resistance movement only just recovering from a brutal defeat in the Uprising of '76. The Japanese Empire controls China, Southeastern Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Oceania, the Eastern Soviet Union, and the entire Pacific Rim. =Roma Aeterna= Roma Aeterna diverged from real history when Nero Claudius Drusus survived his German campaigns and founded a different Julio-Claudian dynasty than in our history. Their patronage of the Heronian Academy led to a more rapid development of industry, which produces in the Roma Aeterna setting a very different world in which the Third Roman Empire based in Hesperia (roughly corresponding to Mexico and Texas) rules much of North and South America, Northern Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and India. The only other significant political entities in the world are Serica (China) and its North American kingdom Fu-Sang (centered on San Francisco), Taehan (a growing empire based on the Korean Peninsula), and the isolationist South American kingdom of Huaraca. The \\"current year\\" in Roma Aeterna is 1878. =Shikaku-Mon= Shikaku-Mon (\\"four-cornered world\\" in the local version of Japanese, because of the four super-power nations that dominate it) is a setting proceeding from a point of divergence in the early 16th century - the survival of Juan of Aragon, son of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, to ascend the throne of Spain as John III. Without the Spanish throne to inherit from John's sister Joanna of Castile, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V was unable to fight France, the Ottoman Empire, and the Protestants of Europe as he did in our history. Combined with the redirection of Sebastian of Portugal's attentions from Inquisition and Crusade to missionary activity in Asia, especially Japan, the changes to world history are innumerable. The \\"current year\\" in Shikaku-Mon is 2015 (the same as \\"Homeline\\" Earth, setting for the \\"Infinity Patrol\\" reality, thus making it of particular interest to the IP). The Westernized and Christian Japanese Empire controls 40% of the globe but 65% of its inhabitants, most of whom are ethnically non-Japanese subjects held to be inferior peoples. The totalitarian \\"synarchist\\" Swedish Empire is similar to the Soviet Union; it controls much of the upper half of North America and exiles dissenters against the state to labor camps in the far north. The Empire of Brazil is a relatively progressive nation which dominates South America. The Kingdom of France is a scientifically and technologically advanced nation with a permanent settlement on the Moon. Shikaku-Mon can be said to partake of its own brand of cyberpunk themes. =Ezcalli= Ezcalli is dominated by the Tenochca (Aztec) Empire. In this world, Carthaginian explorers landed in South America in 580 B.C., two millennia before contact between the Old World and the New in our history. The early exchange of biota resulted in the decimation of the American peoples by Eurasian diseases, but the low technological disparity between the two continents at the time meant the newcomers could not take full advantage of this before new populations with resistance to the diseases developed. More importantly, the introduction of American animals and crops (especially the potato) gave peasant farmers a greater ability to feed themselves and prevented potentates from controlling their subjects through grain imports. This caused the nascent Roman Empire to fly apart in the 1st century CE, and the successor states were still squabbling a millennium later when the hordes of the Mongol Empire arrived. Europe and Asia are now covered with a half- dozen Mongol khanates (the greatest of which is the Khanate of Ch'in) and dozens of semi-independent petty kingdoms that are easy targets for steam- powered Tenochca slave raids. The Tenochca have coaling stations around the world and their continental lands now stretch from the Ohio River to the northern Andes. North of the Tenochca Empire's American territories are the iron mines and weapons factories of the Hotinosavannah League (the Iroquois) to the east and the Tlingit Confederacy to the west. Africa is home to Zoroastrian Egypt, the rapidly arming southern state of KwaZulu and the Songhay Empire, inheritors of Christianity and Roman civilisation. The \\"current year\\" in Ezcalli is 1840. =Gernsback= Gernsback is a parallel that seems drawn straight from a 1930s science fiction adventure story (it is named for the editor Hugo Gernsback, founder of Amazing Stories in which many such tales appeared). Its point of divergence is the marriage of Nikola Tesla to Anne Morgan, daughter of banker and financier J. P. Morgan. In our history the pair were friends, but Tesla died penniless; in Gernsback, their marriage stabilized Tesla, whose inventions went on to revolutionize the world, especially his perfection of a technique for broadcasting electrical power wirelessly. Tesla's brother-in-law J. P. Morgan, Jr. and his companies became instrumental in helping the world's economies recover from the ensuing stock market crash. German and American influence was crucial to the success of the League of Nations in Gernsback; when atomic power was developed in the late 1930s, its World Science Council was placed in charge of nuclear research. Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union saw the potential of atomic energy as a weapon, but the League of Nations sought to forestall the misuse of knowledge in this manner by invading in 1951. The \\"current year\\" in Gernsback is 1965; the League of Nations dominates a world which is economically dominated by the World Science Council and socially frozen (especially in matters of race and gender) in the 1930s. The appeal of Gernsback as a setting is less in its alternative history than in its alternative science and retro-futuristic style; its technological development followed a completely different path in the 20th century than did our world (flying cars are ubiquitous, but the transistor has yet to be developed). Publication history GURPS Alternate Earths was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1996, and written by Kenneth Hite, Craig Neumeier and Michael S. Schiffer. A sequel was published as GURPS Alternate Earths II in 1999. Reception Rick Swan reviewed GURPS Alternate Earths for Dragon magazine #236 (December 1996). He called the book an \\"off- the-wall, one-of-a-kind\\" game supplement which turned out to be one of \\"the best in many a moon\\". He stated that \\"Alternate Earths presents six parallel worlds with haywire history, such as the Confederate States of America (where the Omaha Black Sox play the Mexico City Aztecs in the World Series) and Reich-5 (where you-know-who won World War II).\\" Swan also noted that the book is \\"adaptable\\", saying that the material \\"translates to other game systems with a minimum of tweaking\\", and also that the book is funny: \\"Alternate Earths features rock star Jerry Lee Swaggart and time traveling Nazis\\".

Lewis was born in New Salem, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1884 and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Second Artillery.New International Encyclopedia Early in his career he made himself an authority on ordnance. In 1900, then-Captain Lewis was sent by Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin to Europe to study that subject, his report resulting in the re-armament of the field artillery. By successive promotions, he rose to the rank of colonel in the Coast Artillery Corps in August 1913, and was retired the next month for disability incurred in line of duty. In 1911, he refined an original machine gun design of Samuel Maclean and began active marketing of type which came to be known simply as the \\"Lewis Gun\\", which was used in World War I by the Allied armies, the United States Navy, and the airplanes of the United States and Allies. Initially the United States Army was not interested in his new gun, but after the British and French had bought more than 100,000 for use in the trenches in France, the US Army did purchase them. He declined the royalties - amounting to at least $1,000,000 - on guns made for the United States after it entered the war. His other inventions included a time-interval clock and bell system of signals, a replotting and relocating system for coast batteries, an automatic sight, quick-reading mechanical verniers for use in coast defenses, electric car lighting, and windmill electric lighting systems.

Fictional character biography =Post-Crisis= Born (allegedly, see below) to a French father and a Vietnamese mother, Jade Nguyen had an unhappy childhood and was sold into slavery. As a young adult, after killing her master, Jade was informally adopted by Chinese freedom fighter Weng Chan, who taught her all he knew about guerrilla fighting. She acquired knowledge of poisons from Kruen Musenda, a famed African assassin known as the \\"Spitting Cobra\\", whom she was married to for the two years prior to his death. She is a long-standing rival of the superhero team the Teen Titans. However, when Roy Harper, a.k.a. the archer Speedy, went undercover for the government in a mission to get her confidence and turn her over, the two fell passionately in love. Knowing he would not be able to turn her in, he walked out; Cheshire would not learn his true identity until later. The result of their romance was a daughter, Lian, whom Roy raised. Returning to her mercenary ways after leaving Lian behind for Roy, Jade saved Deathstroke's life so he could help her in stealing nuclear weapons from Russia in an attempt to blackmail the world. To prove she is not bluffing, she obliterates the fictional Middle East nation of Qurac, reasoning that since Qurac is a stronghold of Onslaught terrorists, that Western countries would be secretly grateful.Deathstroke #19 (Feb 1993) DC Comics Cheshire's plans were foiled when her base came under attack and she was forced to flee. She later created her own team, The Ravens. Cheshire volunteered to join Tartarus, a group created by Vandal Savage with the objective of destroying the Titans. During a confrontation with the Titans and the H.I.V.E, Savage shot Cheshire to distract Arsenal. She recovered, but was taken into custody for crimes including destroying Qurac. Sentenced to life imprisonment, she was broken out by the Ravens. Arsenal, however, forced her back into custody. Eventually, Cheshire discovers that her biological father was a Senator named Robert Pullman, and she attempted to torture and kill him. To that end, she defeated Lady Shiva, and devised a plan to use her to fake her own death and flee the country with her daughter. Jade ties up Shiva, gags her and locks her in the trunk of her car (which was wired to explode), hoping that the authorities will find the charred body of an Asian woman in the flaming car wreck and believe that Jade was killed while fleeing the Senator's murder. Unfortunately for her, Catwoman and Gypsy show up and untie Shiva, while Huntress and Black Canary stop Jade from murdering the Senator, and then take her into custody. While escaping the scene of the attempted assassination, Jade is punched in the face and thrown out of the helicopter the women were escaping in by Black Canary to avoid being beaten to death by an enraged Shiva. In 2005, she appeared in the miniseries Villains United as a member of the Secret Six. Cheshire had been blackmailed into joining by Mockingbird, who claimed that there was a small bomb implanted in the back of Lian's head. During the series, she slept with Thomas Blake, a.k.a. Catman, and became pregnant with a replacement child, thereby allowing her to leave the team and no longer needing to worry for Lian's safety. At the end of the miniseries, having betrayed the Six to Luthor's Society, she is shot and critically wounded by Deathstroke. As the faux Luthor orders the Society's withdrawal, one of his last commands is to bring Cheshire with them, provided she is still alive. After the \\"Villains United\\" series, she later turned up alive, living in a mansion in the Himalaya Mountains with her son by Blake. Working with Vandal Savage again, she put out hits on the other members of the Secret Six except for Blake. Taking matters into her own hands, she stabs the Mad Hatter, who is working with the Six. Her blade was poisoned (as usual) and she later bartered the antidote to the poison to Catman in exchange for her safety.

( August 5, 1913 - November 25, 2000) was a Canadian politician who served as both Attorney-General of Ontario and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. He served as a Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament from 1955 until his retirement in 1971. Cass served in the Canadian Armed Forces from 1941 to 1945. Background Born in Chesterville, Ontario, Cass was the older son of William Joseph Mavety Cass and Agnes Isabel (McIntosh) Cass, whose great-grandfather was John McIntosh, of apple fame. He was called to the Bar in Ontario in 1936 and joined his father, who had been called to the Bar in 1911, in the practice of law under the firm name, Cass & Cass. His wife, Olive, was herself the daughter of a former provincial politician, William H. Casselman, who represented Dundas as a United Farmers of Ontario member from 1919 to 1923. Politics Cass represented the riding of Grenville‚ÄîDundas just south of Ottawa. He first won a seat in the 1955 provincial election. He was appointed to provincial cabinet in 1958 as Minister of Highways under Leslie Frost and became known as the cabinet's troubleshooter. In 1961, Frost retired and Cass was considered one of his potential successors. Instead, he supported provincial treasurer James Allan at the party's leadership convention. Allan was defeated by John Robarts, who appointed Cass Minister of Municipal Affairs, and later, Attorney General in 1962. While he was Attorney-General, Cass continued to practise on the weekends as a small-town lawyer in his hometown of Chesterville and another office in nearby Winchester, where his mother lived. However, to avoid a conflict of interest, he stayed out of the courts and practised solely as a solicitor. Cass provoked serious controversy when, in response to an organized crime scare, he proposed Bill 99, a sweeping amendment to the Police Act, which would have broadened police powers allowing the Ontario Police Commission the right to interrogate and cross-examine witnesses in camera in contravention of the traditions established by English Common Law. When queried on the amendments by the press, Cass said \\"Yes, these are drastic, draconian measures that in some ways are really unbelievable in a country that has an English common law system.\\" The resultant uproar and, in particular, a speech by Liberal MPP Andy Thompson forced Cass to resign from Cabinet on March 23, 1964. Thompson's success buoyed him into the position of leader of the Liberal Party several months later. The controversy led to the Robarts government appointing the McRuer Commission on Civil Rights that led to a number of reforms to enhance civil liberties in Ontario. Following his re- election in the 1967 general election, Cass was rehabilitated by being chosen Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario once the body reconvened on February 14, 1968. He was a popular presiding officer and served until his retirement at the 1971 election. As Speaker, Cass ruled that Opposition MPPs could no longer begin their questions during Question Period with the word \\"why\\", as questions were \\"usually not aimed at soliciting information from cabinet ministers, but at giving the questioner an opening to catalogue his complaints about the government.\\" This resulted in various verbal gymnastics as Opposition MPPs struggled to find a way to say \\"why\\" without saying \\"why.

It was released in June 1998 and was the band's first and only recording with the large independent label, TVT Records. Background  After releasing a number of well-received recordings on the smaller psychedelia-focused Bomp! Records label, The Brian Jonestown Massacre were signed to a multi-record deal with TVT.  Recording and content  Matt Hollywood contributed more to this record due to Anton Newcombe being incapable of writing as many songs as he was addicted to heroin at the time. The album is named after a lyric from the David Bowie song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\". \\"Wisdom\\" is a re-recording of the same song that originally appeared on the band's second album, Methodrone. \\"Dawn\\" is also a re-recording, with the original version appearing on Take It from the Man!. \\"Spun\\" is also a re- recording of the same song that appears on the band's album Thank God for Mental Illness. = Musical style = AllMusic's Jason Ankeny writes, \\"Settling into a blissfully psychedelic drift, the album opts not for the Stones-inspired raunch of before but for Byrds-like guitars, muffled drums and pulsating Hammond organ lines, all topped off by Anton Newcombe's half-stoned, half-shamanic vocals\\".  Release  The recording didn't sell as many records as TVT had hoped, and they later mutually dissolved their remaining contractual obligations. \\"Love\\" was released as a CD single, with a demo of \\"Wasting Away\\" as a B-side on TVT Records in 1998. \\"Love\\" and \\"Nothing to Lose\\" was also released as a double A-side single independently in 1997. The release featured \\"Let's Pretend It's Summer\\", \\"I've Been Waiting\\", \\"The Devil May Care (Mom & Dad Don't)\\" and an alternate version of \\"I've Been Waiting\\" as B-sides.

Bobolink was launched on 15 June 1918 by Baltimore Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company, in Baltimore, Maryland; sponsored by Miss Elsie Jean Willis; and commissioned 28 January 1919, with Lieutenant Frank Bruce in command.  World War I minefield clearance  Bobolink departed Norfolk, Virginia in April 1919 to join Division 2, North Sea Minesweeping Detachment, at Kirkwall, Orkney Islands. While sweeping in the North Sea on 14 May 1919, a mine exploded close by, causing considerable damage to the stern and killing Bruce, Frank M., LT. The USS Bruce (DD-329) was named for Lt. Bruce. Her repairs at the Devonport Dockyard, England, took six months and she returned to Norfolk in January 1920.  Postwar operations  Between 1920 and 1931, Bobolink served with the Fleet Base Force, Scouting Fleet, on the U.S. East Coast and participated in fleet problems, concentrations, and joint Army-Navy maneuvers. On 3 March 1932, she arrived on the U.S. West Coast and was thereafter based at San Diego. She operated along the western seaboard between San Francisco and San Quentin Bay, Mexico, with the Fleet Train and various destroyer divisions. In 1935, she took part in the annual exercises and fleet problems held off Hawaii. Between January and March 1939, she participated in fleet problems in the Caribbean and then returned to San Diego, arriving there on 13 May 1939.  World War II operations  In September 1940, Bobolink joined the Train, Base Force, United States Fleet, at Pearl Harbor. She remained there until September 1942. Bobolink was present during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, laying in dock next to six destroyers near the district HQ. Following the attack, she served as a salvage vessel and minesweeper. Between 20 May and 2 July 1942, she was converted to an ocean-going tug (redesignated AT-131 on 1 June 1942). Remaining at Pearl Harbor until September 1942, Bobolink then steamed to the South Pacific and operated out off Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands; Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; and Noumea, New Caledonia, as a tug until February 1944. In particular, she helped rescue survivors and assisted several crippled U.S. warships in the aftermath of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. She arrived at Long Beach, California, 4 March 1944 for overhaul and returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 June 1944. Bobolink was reclassified ATO-131 on 15 May 1944.  Decommissioning  She served in Hawaiian waters until the fall of 1945, and then returned to Mare Island Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned 22 February 1946. She was sold through the Maritime Commission 5 October 1946. Bobolink received one battle star for operations during World War II.

It is often offered as part of a menu of classic American \\"diner\\" dishes and often at Coney Island restaurants. It is largely a phenomenon related to immigration from Greece and Macedonia to the United States in the early 20th century. Origin \\"Virtually all\\" Coney Island variations were developed, apparently independently, by Greek or Macedonian immigrants in the early 1900s, many fleeing the Balkan Wars, who entered the US through Ellis Island in New York City. Family stories of the development of the dishes often included anecdotes about visits to Coney Island. The first documented European name for the island is the Dutch name Conyne Eylandt or Conynge Eylandt. This would roughly be equivalent to Konijn Eiland using modern Dutch spelling, meaning Rabbit Island. The name was anglicized to Coney Island after the English took over the colony in 1664,Robert Morden, \\"A Map of ye English Empire in the Continent of America\\", 1690. Coney Island is labelled \\"Conney Isle\\". Image of Morden map at SUNY Stony Brook. coney being the corresponding English word. The hot dog's fame later spread from this part of Brooklyn, New York, where Nathan Handwerker, a Polish/Jewish immigrant was one of the first entrepreneurs who sold them on the Coney Island Boardwalk. His business was later named \\"Nathan's,\\" an iconic brand that remains popular as both a fast-food chain and as a grocery product. The alternate name for a hot dog - a \\"Coney,\\" most likely derived from the positive regional and national publicity Nathan's began to generate. Regional and local varieties =Indiana= Coney Islands at Ft. Wayne's Famous Coney Island Wiener Stand Ft. Wayne's Famous Coney Island Wiener Stand was opened in 1914 by three now-unknown Macedonian immigrants. Vasil Eschoff, another Macedonian immigrant, purchased an interest from one of the original owners in 1916. Eschoff's descendants have operated the restaurant since. The Coney Island in Fort Wayne is described as a small, fatty pink hot dog with a \\"peppery-sweet\\" coney sauce on a soft bun. However, the ground beef-based coney sauce at Ft. Wayne's Famous Coney Island Wiener Stand has the flavor and consistency of a mild peppered savory pork sausage, reflecting its Macedonian heritage. The small hot dog is grilled on a flattop, placed in a steamed bun, yellow mustard applied, then a few teaspoonfuls of the savory chili sauce are added which is then topped with chopped yellow onion. =Michigan= Jane and Michael Stern, writing in 500 Things to Eat Before it's Too Late, note that \\"there's only one place to start [to pinpoint the top Coney Islands], and that is Detroit. Nowhere is the passion for them more intense.\\" James Schmidt, in a debate at the 2018 National Fair Food Summit, noted that \\"Detroit is synonymous with the Coney Dog: you simply cannot have one without the other.\\" The Coney Island developed in Michigan is a natural-casing beef or beef and pork European-style Wiener W√ºrstchen (Vienna sausage) of German origin, topped with a beef heart-based sauce, one or two stripes of yellow mustard and diced or chopped onions. The variety is a fixture in Flint, Detroit, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and southeastern Michigan. The style originated in the early 20th century, with competing claims from American and Lafayette Coney Islands (1917) in Detroit, and Todoroff's Original Coney Island (1914) in Jackson. The longest continuously operated Coney Island (in the same location) is in Kalamazoo (1915). Detroit style Competing neighboring Coney restaurants in DetroitIn Detroit, historically many Greek and Macedonian immigrants operated Coney islands, or restaurants serving Detroit Coney dogs. By 2012 many Albanians began operating them as well.Yung and Grimm p. 2 . The Greeks established Onassis Coney Island, which has closed. Greek immigrants established the Coney chains Kerby's Koney Island, Leo's Coney Island, and National Coney Island during the 1960s and early 1970s. All three chains sell some Greek food items with Coney dogs. Detroit style sauce is a bean-less chili sauce, differing from the chili dogs they offer only in the lack of beans. National has most of its restaurants on the east side of the city, and Kerby's and Leo's have the bulk of their restaurants on the west side of the Detroit area.Yung, and Grimm p. 21 . On the outskirts of Detroit, in Shelby Township, resides Scott McNamara. Scott is known to the locals as \\"Scottdog\\" because of his invention of the Scottdog Coney. A simple hot dog with home-made chili on it. Flint style A Flint-style coney (with dry coney sauce) at Rio's Coney Island in Flint Flint style is characterized by a dry hot dog topping made with a base of ground beef heart, which is ground to a consistency of fine-ground beef.Florine, Bob; Davison, Matt; Jaeger, Sally, Two To Go: A Short History of Flint's Coney Island Restaurants, 2007, Genesee County Historical Society Some assert that in order to be an \\"authentic\\" Flint coney, the hot dog must be a Koegel coney and the sauce by Angelo's, which opened in 1949. However, the sauce was originally developed by a Macedonian in 1924, Simion P. (Sam) Brayan, for his Flint's Original Coney Island restaurant. Brayan was the one who contracted with Koegel Meat Company to make the coney they still make today, also contracting with Abbott's Meat to provide the fine-grind beef heart sauce base. Abbott's still makes Brayan's 1924 sauce base available to restaurants and the public through the Koegel Meat Company and Abbott's Meats. Restaurants then add chopped onions saut√©ed in beef tallow, along with their own spice mix and other ingredients, to Abbott's sauce base to make their sauce. Popular folklore perpetuates a legend that a Flint coney sauce recipe containing ground beef and ground hot dogs is the \\"original\\" Flint Coney sauce recipe. Variations on this story include either that a relative of the storyteller knew or worked with the former owner of Flint's Original and received the recipe from them, or that the wife of the owner of Flint's Original allowed the publication of the recipe in the Flint Journal after his death. Ron Krueger, longtime food writer of the Flint Journal, included it in a collection of recipes from the newspaper but without a cited source, unlike the rest of the recipes in the collection. When asked about this Mr. Krueger replied, \\"That recipe appeared in The Journal several times over the years. [I don't] think I ever saw it in the context of a story or ever saw any attribution. It always included the word 'original' in the title, but anybody who knows anything knows otherwise.\\" As to the second story, of Brayan's wife later allowing the publication of the recipe, Velicia Brayan died in 1976, while Simion Brayan lived until the age of 100 and died in 1990. The actual source of this recipe appears to be an earlier Flint Journal Food Editor, Joy Gallagher, who included the recipe in her column of May 23, 1978. In that column she stated she had included the recipe in an even earlier column. Her apparent source was \\"a woman who said she was the wife of a chef at the original Coney Island, and that she copied the recipe from his personal recipe book.\\" Gallagher stated \\"I believe her\\". However, Gallagher also wrote, \\"I'm not making any claims\\". In the same column she also included a second recipe that used beef heart, which she wrote \\"came to me recently from a reader who swears it is the sauce served at Angelo's.\\" The folklore has mixed the supposed sources of the two recipes in this column from Gallagher, with people claiming the ground hot dog recipe is reportedly from Angelo's. In his column published in the Flint Journal on April 18, 1995, Food Editor Ron Krueger reported taking Gallagher's ground hot dog recipe directly to Angelo's co- owner Tom V. Branoff, who refuted the recipe line-by-line. Gallagher's pre-1978 column is still being researched. Jackson style Jackson style uses a topping of either ground beef or ground beef heart, onions and spices. The sauce is traditionally a thick hearty one whether ground beef or ground beef heart is used. This meat sauce is applied on a quality hot dog in a steamed bun and then topped with diced or chopped onions and a stripe of mustard. The Todoroffs' restaurants were some of the earlier locations for Jackson coneys beginning in 1914. However, those locations are now closed. The company currently manufactures and distribute their coney sauce for retail purchase at supermarkets or other restaurants. There are several other coney restaurants in the area, most notably Jackson Coney Island and Virginia Coney Island, both of which are located on East Michigan Avenue in front of the train station near where the original Todoroff's restaurant was located. These restaurants all use a blend of onion and spices similar to Todoroff's but use ground beef heart instead of ground beef for the coney sauce. The Jackson style was late to the usage of beef heart in the sauce, using ground beef prior to converting to ground beef heart in the early 1940s. Jackson takes their coneys very seriously. Each year Jackson Magazine or the Jackson Citizen Patriot have a best coney contest voted on by residents for all the restaurants in the area. Kalamazoo style Coney Island Kalamazoo was founded in 1915, and is the longest continuously operated Coney Island in the state. Their coney island is made up of a topping made from their own recipe served on a Koegel's Skinless Frankfurter. Koegel's wasn't founded until 1916, and it's unknown which hot dog Coney Island Kalamazoo used prior to the Skinless Frankfurter's development. Suppliers The following meatpackers provide Coney dogs and European-style Vienna sausage (Frankfurter W√ºrstel) to restaurants and consumers in Michigan: * Dearborn Sausage Co., primary supplier in Detroit * Koegel Meat Company, Flint area primary supplier Many Coney Island restaurants make their own sauces from scratch. However, the different styles of sauces are also available from the following meatpackers: * Abbott's Meat: Flint style made with ground beef heart * National Chili Co., primary metro Detroit supplier * Detroit Chili Company (owned by American Coney Island): Detroit style =Minnesota= Hot dogs from the Original Coney Island Restaurant and Bar in St. Paul, Minnesota Greek immigrant Gus Saites opened his Original Coney Island in Duluth in 1921. The hot dog used is the Vienna Beef from Chicago, which is topped with the restaurant's own coney sauce, with options of mustard, onion, and for a small fee, cheese. The Superior Street location also offers sport peppers as a topping. The decor includes a copy of their 1959 menu showing coney islands were 25 cents each. The Original Coney Island Restaurant and Bar, operated by the Arvanitis Family since 1923 in a former Civil War armory, is the oldest remaining business in St. Paul, though now open only on special occasions. =Ohio= Cheese coneys/Cincinnati In Cincinnati, a \\"coney\\" is a hot dog topped with Cincinnati chili, usually with mustard and chopped onions. A \\"cheese coney\\" adds a final topping of shredded cheddar cheese. The dish was developed by Macedonian immigrants Tom and John Kardjieff, founders of Empress Chili, in 1922. The coney topping is also used as a topping for spaghetti, a dish called a \\"two- way\\" or chili spaghetti. there were over 250 \\"chili parlors\\" in Cincinnati serving coneys. The two largest chains today are Skyline Chili and Gold Star Chili. =Oklahoma= Coneys are on restaurant menus throughout Tulsa and were originally created there by Greek immigrants. Jane and Michael Stern write that \\"Oklahoma is especially rich in classic coneys\\" and call out the Coney I-Lander, writing they \\"perfectly deliver the cheap-eats ecstasy that is the Coney's soul.\\" Oklahoma coneys are small hot dogs on steamed buns with a spicy-sweet dark brown chili sauce, onions, and optional cheese and hot sauce. =Texas= James Coney Island operates a number of locations in the area of Houston, Texas. The company was founded in 1923 by two Greek immigrant brothers, James and Tom Papadakis, the former being the company's namesake.

Bell was contracted to operate the center, and the airfield leased by the USAAF was improved with macadam runways (three at 4000x150 feet and the E/W runway at 4200x300), taxiways, etc. Military units at Niagara Falls included a Modification Center Headquarters and a training school, \\"Niagara Falls East Tr Sch\\" (a different modification center, \\"Buffalo Mun-Mod Ctr B\\", was located at the 1925 Buffalo Municipal Airport). In 1944, the Manhattan Engineer District used the military Niagara Falls Storage Site on the 1941 Lake Ontario Ordnance Works Sitehttp://wikimapia.org/22049659/Lake- Ontario-Ordnance-Works-Site for radioactive residues and wastes from uranium ore processing. http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/Missions/HTRW/FUSRAP/NiagaraFallsStorageSite.aspx Radioactive wastes and residues continued to be brought to the site for storage until 1952. In 1982 the Department of Energy (DOE) began clean-up and consolidation of the radioactive wastes and residues in an earthen containment cell constructed on the property, which was completed in 1986. =Naval air station= The Naval Air Station Niagara Falls was established in 1946 and the installation was expanded. Jurisdiction of the airport returned to a civilian agency later in 1946 (a USAF joint-use agreement was made for Air Force Reserve and NYANG use of the airport). ConAC's First Air Force assigned the Air Force Reserve's 90th Reconnaissance Wing to the military installation on 26 December 1946, followed by the 26th Reconnaissance Group (23 October 1947) and the 4th Reconnaissance Squadron. The reconnaissance units were inactivated on 27 June 1949, and the New York Air National Guard's 107th Fighter Group was federalized on 8 December 1948 (initially equipped with TAC P-47 Thunderbolts). 107th personnel deployed in March 1951 to the Far East Air Forces for the Korean War.

The 136th FIS was returned to state control when ADC activated the 47th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 1 December 1952 as a replacement. The 47th FIS initially used the F-47s of the 135th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron. NFAFB activated the 518th Air Defense Group on 16 February 1953 (designated 15th Fighter Group on 18 August 1955 under Project Arrow) and upgraded to F-86F Sabres in February 1953 (F-86D in September).

The USGS added the military station to the Geographic Names Information System on November 17, 2008. Since 2011, the Army Reserve's 277th Quartermaster Company has provided support for fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft operations. In 2016, it was announced that the 914th will replace their aging C-130 aircraft with eight KC-135 Stratotankers. The conversion is included in the 2017 budget, but the timeline is still unclear.

Blum is an American research entomologist and a noted authority in the field of chemical ecology.  Early life and education  Born in 1929 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Blum (pronounced to rhyme with \\"gum\\") grew up in that city and in Chicago, Illinois. He earned a BSc in Biology and his Ph.D. in entomology from the University of Illinois. After serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he joined the faculty of Louisiana State University. In the 1960s he moved to the University of Georgia, where he spent three decades as a research professor before his retirement. Personal life Blum is the father of Deborah Blum, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, author, and professor of science journalism.  Research  Blum has concentrated much of his research in the area of chemical ecology, and is well-recognized as an expert on pheromones. His subjects of interest also included the eastern lubber grasshopper (Romalea microptera) and imported fire ants as the latter species (Solenopsis invicta) spread through the southern United States. Blum's entomology associates and close friends include noted apiologist Stephen Taber III.  Television appearances  Blum may be best-known outside of academia for his infrequent, but memorable television appearances. An extrovert with a sly sense of humor, he is remembered as the grinning scientist who convinced TV personality Bryant Gumbel to join him in a breakfast of saut√©ed grubs on NBC's Today Show.  Publications  A past winner of the Lamar Dodd Award for excellence in research, he is the author of many scholarly publications, including the book Chemical Defenses of Arthropods, and he has also played a role in popularizing interest in insects.

Nairac is alleged to have colluded with loyalist paramilitaries in the murder of the Miami Showband, amongst other killings. Several men have been imprisoned for his death, but his body has never been found. Early life Nairac was born in Mauritius, then a British Crown colony, to an English mother and a father of French-Mauritian origin, his mother was Anglican and his father a Catholic who worked as an eye surgeon. Nairac was the youngest of four children; he had two sisters, Rosemonde and Gabrielle, and a brother, David. David died of myocarditis in 1962, aged 24. He attended preparatory school at Gilling Castle, a feeder school for Ampleforth College, a Catholic public school, which he attended a year later. Whilst at Ampleforth he academically excelled, was head of his house and played rugby for the school. He became friends with the sons of Lord Killanin and went to stay with the family in Dublin and in Spiddal in Connemara, County Galway. Nairac read medieval and military history at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he excelled in sport; he played for the Oxford University Rugby 2nd XV and revived the Oxford University boxing club, with which he won four blues in bouts with Cambridge. He was also a falconer, keeping in his rooms a bird that was used in the film Kes. He left Oxford in 1971 and entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst under the sponsorship of the Grenadier Guards, into which he was commissioned on graduation. After Sandhurst, he undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Dublin, before joining the regiment. Military service in Northern Ireland Nairac's first tour of duty in Northern Ireland was with No.1 Company, the Second Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. The Battalion was stationed in Belfast from 5 July 1973 to 31 October 1973. The Grenadiers were given responsibility first for the Protestant Shankill Road area and the predominantly Catholic Ardoyne area. This was a time of high tension and regular contact with paramilitaries. Ostensibly, the battalion's main objectives were to search for weapons and to find paramilitaries. Nairac was frequently involved in such activity on the streets of Belfast and was a community relations activist at the Ardoyne sports club. The battalion's tour was adjudged a success with 58 weapons, 9,000 rounds of ammunition and 693 lbs of explosives taken and 104 men jailed. The battalion had no casualties and did not shoot anyone. After his tour had ended he stayed on as liaison officer for the replacement battalion, the 1st Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. On their first patrol, Nairac narrowly avoided the impact of the explosion of a car bomb on the Crumlin Road. Rather than returning to his battalion, which was being transferred to Hong Kong, Nairac volunteered for military intelligence duties in Northern Ireland. Following the completion of several training courses, he returned to Northern Ireland in 1974, attached to 4 Field Survey Troop, Royal Engineers, one of the three subunits of a Special Duties unit known as 14 Intelligence Company (14 Int). Posted to South County Armagh, 4 Field Survey Troop was given the task of performing surveillance duties. Nairac was the liaison officer for the unit, the local British Army brigade and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). He assumed duties outside his official jurisdiction as a liaison officer, including undercover operations. He apparently claimed to have visited pubs in Irish republican strongholds, sung Irish rebel songs and acquired the nickname \\"Danny Boy\\". He was driven to pubs by the future Conservative MP Patrick Mercer, who was then an army officer. Former SAS Warrant Officer Ken Connor, who was involved in the creation of 14 Int, wrote of him in his book, Ghost Force, p. 263: Nairac finished his tour with 14th Int in mid-1975 and returned to his regiment in London, having been promoted to Captain on 4 September 1975. Following a rise in violence culminating in the Kingsmill massacre, the British Army increased their presence in Northern Ireland, and Nairac accepted a post as a liaison officer. On his fourth tour, Nairac was a liaison officer in Bessbrook Mill. Death On the evening of 14 May 1977, Nairac drove alone to 'The Three Steps' pub in Dromintee, a village in south County Armagh. He is said to have told regulars of the pub that he was Danny McErlaine, a motor mechanic and member of the Official IRA from the Irish Republican Ardoyne area in North Belfast. The real McErlaine, on the run since 1974, was killed by the Provisional IRA in June 1978 after stealing arms from the organisation. Witnesses say that Nairac got up and sang a republican folk song, \\"The Broad Black Brimmer\\", with the band who were playing that night. At around 11.45 p.m., he was abducted, following a struggle in the pub's car park and taken across the border into the Republic of Ireland to a field in the Ravensdale Woods in the north of County Louth. Following a violent interrogation, during which Nairac was allegedly punched, kicked, pistol-whipped and hit with a wooden post, he was shot dead in a field.Bandit Country, pages 305 to 307 He did not admit to his true identity. Terry McCormick, one of Nairac's abductors, posed as a priest in order to try to elicit information by way of Nairac's confession. Nairac's last words according to McCormick were: \\"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned\\". Claims that his body was disposed of by being put through a meat grinder have been dismissed as a myth. His disappearance sparked a large-scale search throughout Ireland. The hunt in Northern Ireland was led by Major H. Jones, who, as a colonel in the Parachute Regiment, was to be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in the Falklands War. Jones was Brigade Major at HQ 3rd Infantry Brigade. Nairac and Jones had become friends and Nairac would sometimes eat supper at the Jones household. After a four-day search, the Garda S√≠och√°na confirmed to the RUC that they had reliable evidence of Nairac's killing. An edition of Spotlight, broadcast on 19 June 2007, claimed that his body was not destroyed in a meat grinder, as alleged by an unnamed IRA source.Harnden 2000, p. 311 McCormick, who has been on the run in the United States for thirty years because of his involvement in the killing (including being the first to attack Nairac in the car park), was told by a senior IRA commander that he was buried on farmland and reburied elsewhere. The location of the body's resting place remains a mystery.New revelations on Nairac killing BBC News Nairac is one of three IRA victims whose graves have never been revealed and who are collectively known as 'The Disappeared'. The cases are under review by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. In May 2000, allegations were made claiming that Nairac had married and fathered a child with a woman named Nel Lister, also known as Oonagh Flynn or Oonagh Lister. In 2001, her son sought DNA testing himself and revealed the allegations to be untrue. Criminal prosecutions In November 1977, Liam Townson, a 24-year- old IRA member from the village of Meigh outside Newry, was convicted of Nairac's murder. Townson was the son of an Englishman who had married a County Meath woman. He confessed to killing Nairac and implicated other members of the unit involved. Townson made two admissible confessions to Garda officers. The first was made around the time of his arrest, it started with \\"I shot the British captain. He never told us anything. He was a great soldier.\\" The second statement was made at Dundalk police station, after Townson had consulted a solicitor. He had become hysterical and distressed and screamed a confession to the officer in charge of the investigation. Townson was convicted in Dublin's Special Criminal Court of Nairac's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He served 13 years before his 1990 release. In 1998, he was part of Conor Murphy's election campaign team.Harnden 2000, p.308 In 1978, the RUC arrested five men from the South Armagh area. Three ‚Äì Gerard Fearon, 21, Thomas Morgan, 18, and Daniel O'Rourke, 33 ‚Äì were charged with Nairac's murder. Michael McCoy, 20, was charged with kidnapping, and Owen Rocks, 22, was accused of withholding information. Fearon and Morgan were convicted of Nairac's murder. O'Rourke was acquitted, but found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for ten years. McCoy was jailed for five years and Rocks for two. Morgan died in a road accident in 1987, a year after his release. O'Rourke became a prominent Sinn F√©in member in Drumintee. Two other men, Terry McCormick and Pat Maguire, wanted in connection with this incident, remain on the run. Maguire has been reported as living in New Jersey in the US. On 20 May 2008, 57-year-old IRA veteran Kevin Crilly of Jonesborough, County Armagh was arrested by officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). He had been on the run in the United States but had returned to Northern Ireland under an alias. He was charged the following day with the kidnapping and false imprisonment of Nairac. In November 2009, Crilly was also charged with the murder of Nairac at Newry magistrates' court during a bail hearing on the two counts on which he had been charged in 2008.Man charged over Nairac murder, RT√â News, 11 November 2009 Crilly was cleared on all counts in April 2011, as the judge considered that the prosecution had failed to prove intention or prior knowledge on his part. Nairac's killing is one of those under investigation by the PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team (HET). George Cross Award On 13 February 1979, Nairac was posthumously awarded the George Cross. Collusion allegations Posthumous claims have been made about Nairac's involvement in the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, the killing of an IRA member in the Republic of Ireland and his relationship with Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. =Hidden Hand documentary= Nairac has been accused of involvement in the murder of an IRA member and of collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Allegations were made concerning Nairac in a 1993 Yorkshire Television documentary about the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings of May 1974 entitled Hidden Hand. The narrator states: According to the documentary, support for this allegation was said to have come from various sources: Geoff Knupfer of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains stated that Nairac was in Ashford, Kent, England at the time of the bombings. =Holroyd= It was alleged by a former Secret Intelligence Service operative, Captain Fred Holroyd, that Nairac admitted involvement in the assassination of IRA member John Francis Green on 10 January 1975 to him. Holroyd claimed in a New Statesman article written by Duncan Campbell that Nairac had boasted about Green's death and showed him a colour Polaroid photograph of Green's corpse taken directly after his assassination.Rolston, Bill and Gilmartin, Mairead: Unfinished business: state killings and the quest for truth. Beyond the Pale Publications, p. 34. These claims were given prominence when, in 1987, Ken Livingstone MP told the House of Commons that Nairac was quite likely to have been the person who organised the killing of three Miami Showband musicians.Livingstone, Ken You Can't Say That pp 294‚Äì5 The Barron Report stated that: Holroyd's evidence was also questioned by Barron in the following terms: Geoff Knupfer of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains states Nairac was 80 miles away in Derry at the time. =Barron Report= Nairac was mentioned in Mr. Justice Henry Barron's inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings when it examined the claims made by the Hidden Hand documentary, Holroyd and Colin Wallace Former RUC Special Patrol Group member John Weir, who was also a UVF member, claimed he had received information from an informant that Nairac was involved in the killing of Green:Report by Justice Henry Barron into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, Dublin, December 2003, P. 206 In addition, \\"Surviving Miami Showband members Steve Travers and Des McAlee testified in court that an Army officer with a crisp English accent oversaw the Miami attack\\", the implication being that this was Nairac.Enigmatic SAS man linked to the massacre, The News Letter, 1 August 2005 Travers was uncertain whether or not Nairac was the man overseeing the attack, stating that his distinct impression was that the man had fair hair, in contrast to Nairac's dark hair. Fred Holroyd and John Weir also linked Nairac to the Green and Miami Showband killings. Martin Dillon, however, in his book The Dirty War, maintained that Nairac was not involved in either attack.Dillon, Martin. The Dirty War. p.173. Geoff Knupfer of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains states Nairac was in either London or Scotland at this time. Colin Wallace, in describing Nairac as a Military Intelligence Liaison Officer (MILO) said \\"his duties did not involve agent handling\\". Nevertheless, Nairac \\"seems to have had close links with the Mid-Ulster UVF, including Robin Jackson and Harris Boyle\\". According to Wallace, \\"he could not have carried out this open association without official approval, because otherwise he would have been transferred immediately from Northern Ireland\\".Report by Justice Henry Barron into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, Dublin, December 2003, p. 175-176 Wallace wrote in 1975; Nairac was on his fourth tour of duty in 1977. Robin Jackson was implicated in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974, and Harris Boyle was blown up by his own bomb during the Miami Showband massacre. The Barron Inquiry found a chain of ballistic history linking weapons and killings under the control of a group of UVF and security force members, including RUC Special Patrol Group members John Weir and Billy McCaughey, that is connected to those alleged to have carried out the bombings. This group was known as the \\"Glenanne gang\\". Incidents they were responsible for \\"included, in 1975, three murders at Donnelly's bar in Silverbridge, the murders of two men at a fake Ulster Defence Regiment checkpoint, the murder of IRA man John Francis Green in the Republic, the murders of members of the Miami showband and the murder of Dorothy Trainor in Portadown in 1976, they included the murders of three members of the Reavey family, and the attack on the Rock Bar in Tassagh.\\" According to Weir, members of the gang began to suspect that Nairac was playing republican and loyalist paramilitaries off against each other, by feeding them information about murders carried out by the \\"other side\\" with the intention of \\"provoking revenge attacks\\". In fiction Eoin McNamee's 2004 novel The Ultras contains a fictionalised, but factually-based account of Nairac's life. McNamee has said that he had had \\"the idea of Nairac in my head for a long time, but I wasn't able to find a way into the whole subject. In the end, I used him as a conduit to the covert and psychic infrastructure of the time, to the gripping physical and moral texture of what was going on.\\" See also *British Military Intelligence Systems in Northern Ireland *Columba McVeigh *Disappearance of Peter Wilson *The Troubles in Forkhill *Special Reconnaissance Unit *Thomas Murphy (Irish republican) *Peter Wilson (Disappeared) *Gerard Evans *List of kidnappings *List of solved missing persons cases *Murder of Jean McConville *Murder of Gareth O'Connor *Internal Security Unit Further reading * Bradley, Anthony.

Administrative divisions Communes of Littoral Department The department of Littoral was created in 1999, when it was split off from Atlantique Department and Cotonou was made its capital. It is the smallest of all departments in the country. Littoral comprises just one commune/city, Cotonou, Benin's largest city and its economic capital. Cotonou is subdivided into 13 arrondissements, which are further subdivided into 165 neighborhoods. Benin originally had six administrative regions (d√©partements), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (directions d√©partementales) of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the sous-prefectures, the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments. Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015.

Cohan which was a hit on Broadway in 1922 and 1923. The film was written by Jack McGowan and directed by Norman Taurog. Its cast included Judy Garland, George Murphy, Charles Winninger and Marvin Miller. The film is notable for containing Judy Garland's only on-screen death scene, although she re-appears in the film as the daughter of the character who died. Plot In Ireland, Jerry Kelly (George Murphy) marries his sweetheart, Nellie Noonan (Judy Garland) over the objections of her ne'er-do-well father, Michael Noonan (Charles Winninger), who swears never to speak to Jerry again, even though he reluctantly accompanies the newlyweds to America, where Jerry becomes a policeman, and all three become citizens. Michael continues to hold his grudge against Jerry, even when Nellie dies while giving birth to little Nellie. Years later, Jerry is now a captain on the police force, and little Nellie (also played by Judy Garland) has grown up as the spitting image of her mother. When Nellie becomes enamored of Dennis Fogarty (Marvin Miller), the son of Michael's old friend Timothy Fogarty ( Arthur Shields), the squabbling between Nellie's father and grandfather intensifies, as Michael objects to the romance, and finally leaves home because of it. Eventually, the three generations are reconciled, and Nellie and Dennis remain a couple.TCM Full synopsisErickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie)Bubbeo, Daniel Plot summary (IMDB) Cast *Judy Garland as Nellie Noonan Kelly and as Little Nellie Kelly *George Murphy as Jerry Kelly *Charles Winninger as Michael \\"Mike\\" Noonan *Douglas McPhail as Dennis Fogarty *Arthur Shields as Timothy Fogarty *Rita Page as Mrs. Mary Fogarty *Forrester Harvey as Moriarity *James Burke as Police Sergeant McGowan *George Watts as Mr. Keevan, NYC Bar Owner Songs Little Nellie Kelly offers Judy Garland the opportunity to sing a swing version of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\", more than 10 years before Gene Kelly more famously sang it in his film Singin' in the Rain (1952), as well as several newer songs, including the traditional \\"A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow\\" sung partly in Irish-Gaelic. There are also two entertaining production numbers, one set at the New York City Policeman's Ball, which showcases Garland at her most attractive, and the other written by Roger Edens so that Garland can belt out \\"It's A Great Day for the Irish\\" while marching up New York's famed 5th Avenue during the St. Patrick's Day Parade. This song became one of Garland's biggest hits. Songs cut from the film include: \\"Rings on Your Fingers and Bells on Your Toes\\" (used in Garland's later film Babes on Broadway, 1941), \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"How Can You Buy Killarney\\". Production After the success of The Wizard of Oz (1939), the film was a \\"test\\" by MGM to evaluate both Garland's audience appeal and her physical image. It was rumoured at the time that George M Cohan sold the rights expressly as a vehicle for the young Garland. The film gave 18-year-old Garland the opportunity to grow up as she is in the first half of the picture set in Ireland, in which she plays Nellie Noonan, the mother of Little Nellie Kelly. Although called 'a bit of Blarney', overall the film was well received and has become a classic St Patrick's Day film. Critics noted \\"she (Judy Garland) gets prettier with each picture\\".Little Nellie Kelly at the Judy Garland Database Box office According to MGM records the film earned USD$968,000 in the US and Canada and $1,078,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $680,000.

It is the third church to have been located at the same location in Reinli. History Drawing of Reinli Stave Church by Georg Andreas Bull ca. 1855 The first references made to a church at this location comes from King Olaf Haraldsson who travelled through Valdres in 1023, and also visited Reinli. It is believed that there was a pagan temple at the same location before the first church was erected. The age of the Reinli stave church is uncertain. Through radiocarbon dating, logs in the church have been dated to 1190, which somewhat contradicts previous datings of the church. There are some claims that the church was built after 1326, but this seems to be outside the error envelope of radiocarbon dating. It could be that the church was rebuilt from materials used in an earlier church. There is, however, a written account of the church's existence in 1327. The Reinli stave church follows a plan set by continental churches in monasteries. Later the church was rebuilt by Sira Thord, who is buried beneath the south-east entrance. The church is generally assumed to be close to its original configuration, although some sources dispute this. The church underwent interior changes in 1884‚Äì1885. Restoration work was done on the exterior in 1976‚Äì1977. Of medieval fixtures, only the altarpiece and the baptismal font are left in the church. An old pillory stands outside the church, but is no longer in use. On May 17, 1845 its use was formally abandoned when the medieval law was changed. There is no electric heating or light in the church. The church is currently used on special occasions and otherwise functions as a museum..

He died from an illness that was not heart or transplant related. Morris had his first heart attack in 1975 and was told to expect to live only months. He became an active campaigner against heart disease, an advocate of organ donation as well as a symbol of the success of organ transplantation. Early life and illness Derrick Morris was born on 24 March 1930. He was from Swansea in Wales, and was working as a supervisor at Swansea Docks when he suffered his first heart attack in 1975. He was given only a 15% chance of survival, and was told to \\"live six months at a time\\".Heartzine.com \\"Longest-surviving Heart Transplant Patient Has Died\\", 4 August 2005. Accessed 21 February 2013 Heart surgery Morris was initially sceptical when a heart transplant was suggested but was persuaded by his doctor. He recalled, \\"we were told of the dangers. Because transplant work was in its infancy, the chances of survival were slim. But I decided for the family's sake to go ahead.\\" His surgeon Magdi Yacoub later commented that Morris's transplant helped shape public opinion: \\"Most importantly, Derrick went on to show that transplantation was a good thing.\\" The operation took place on 23 February 1980 at Harefield Hospital and was Yacoub's third such procedure and one of 14 performed at Harefield that year, following an initial moratorium on heart transplant procedures and before the introduction of cyclosporin. The procedure had been discontinued in 1973 due to poor results. The donor was a 26-year-old woman who had been killed in a car crash. After the operation, Morris eventually returned to work at the docks. He was the eleventh person in the UK to receive a heart transplant. It was argued that the cost of the operation was not money well spent because the National Health Service would have been better to spend it on preventing heart disease rather than doing transplants. Several people who had transplants at Harefield died while Morris was recovering. Morris's fate became intertwined with the largely transformative transplant success of Yacoub, who had an internal drive to perfect his craft, his team and their results. Later life By the 20th anniversary of his operation, Morris already held the European survival record. The longest heart transplant survivor in Britain before Morris's surgery was Keith Castle, who had surgery performed by Sir Terence English in August 1979 at Papworth Hospital. In conjunction with celebrating his two decades of postoperative life, Morris said his heart disease was serious and debilitating, noting: \\"Twenty years ago I was a complete invalid. I couldn't even walk. In February 1980 Yacoub gave me my new heart and since then I have come on in leaps and bounds.\\" This enabled him to travel to a number of countries, including making five journeys to the United States, and see his grandchildren grow up. These were all experiences that would not have been possible without the transplant. By 2000, Harefield ran the largest heart and lung transplant programme in the world. Yacoub and his team went on to perform more than 3,000 heart and heart‚Äìlung transplants. Morris retired at the age of 65 and outlived his wife Beryl. When 25 years arrived, Morris expressed surprise: \\"It was an anniversary I thought I would never get to.\\" In July 2005, Morris joined 1,000 other people who had survived heart and lung transplant operations at a celebration at Harefield Hospital to mark 25 years of transplant surgery. He was Harefield's longest and Europe's longest surviving recipient. Just weeks before his death, he participated in a stroll along Swansea Bay to raise funds for heart disease research. Death and legacy Morris died from a flu-like illness on 30 July 2005 at the age of 75, six months after the 25th anniversary party. By then, he had three grandchildren. His long lasting legacy was that: ‚ÄúMost importantly, Derrick went on to show that transplantation was a good thing‚Äù, said Yacoub. Morris is said to have been instrumental in a sea change in public opinion about this type of surgery. Morris promoted campaigns to fight heart disease and was effectively both a benchmark and a \\"poster child\\" for signing up potential organ donors. His survival and his lifetime example was called a transplant medicine \\"inspiration\\" by Yacoub. His successful operation and prolonged survival had a profound effect on public opinion relative to heart transplants. His longevity record was later surpassed by John McCafferty, who became Britain's longest surviving heart transplant recipient by 2013 at the age 73.

He was the first MLB player to come out as gay to teammates and team owners during his professional career and the first to publicly acknowledge it, stating, \\"They can't ever say now that a gay man can't play in the majors, because I'm a gay man and I made it.\\" In October 1977, Burke ran onto the field to congratulate his Dodgers teammate Dusty Baker after Baker hit his 30th home run; Burke raised his hand over his head and Baker slapped it. They are widely credited with inventing the high five. Burke kept active in sports after retiring from baseball. He competed in the 1982 Gay Olympics, now re-named Gay Games, in track, and in 1986 in basketball. He played for many years in the San Francisco Gay Softball League. He died from AIDS-related causes in 1995. In August 2013, Burke was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame. Burke was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2015. Early athletic career Burke was an accomplished high school basketball star, leading the Berkeley High School, California, Yellow Jackets to an undefeated season and the 1970 Northern California championships. Burke could dunk a basketball with both hands, a rare feat for anyone under 6\\"0 tall. He was voted onto the all- tournament team at the Tournament of Champions (TOC) and received a Northern California MVP award. Burke was named Northern California's High School Basketball Player of the Year in 1970. Major League career Toward the beginning of his career, an assistant coach described him as the next Willie Mays. Burke was a highly scouted star in the Los Angeles Dodgers minor league system before being called up to the major league club. As a gay man, Burke's association with the Dodgers was difficult. According to his 1995 autobiography Out at Home, Dodgers General Manager Al Campanis offered to pay for a lavish honeymoon if Burke agreed to marry. Burke refused to do so, and is said to have responded \\"to a woman?\\"\\"Patient Zero\\", RadioLab, May 30, 2012. He also angered Dodgers' manager Tommy Lasorda by befriending the manager's gay son, Tommy Lasorda, Jr. Lasorda has disputed that but says he does not understand Burke's behavior at the time: \\"Why wouldn't he come out? Why keep that inside? Glenn had a lot of talent. He could have been an outstanding basketball or baseball player. He sure was good in the clubhouse. What happened? I don't know what happened. He just wasn't happy here?\\" The Dodgers eventually traded Burke to the Oakland Athletics for Billy North, claiming that they needed an experienced player who could contribute right away. North did have more experience and better statistics, but some would argue he was less talented, and there have been suggestions that homophobia was behind the trade. The trade was unpopular with Dodger players. The day after the trade was announced, teammate Davey Lopes said: \\"He was the life of the team, on the buses, in the clubhouse, everywhere.\\" In Oakland, Burke received little playing time in the 1978 and 1979 seasons. Billy Martin used the slur faggot in the clubhouse when he became the Athletics' manager in 1980, and some teammates avoided showering with Burke. Burke suffered a knee injury before the 1980 season began, and the Athletics sent him to the minors in Utah and then released him from his contract before the season ended. In his four seasons and 225 games in the majors playing for the Dodgers and Athletics, Burke had 523 at-bats, batted .237 with two home runs, 38 RBIs and 35 stolen bases. =Sexuality= Burke said \\"By 1978 I think everybody knew\\" and he was \\"sure his teammates didn't care.\\" Former Dodgers team captain Davey Lopes said \\"No one cared about his lifestyle.\\" Burke told The New York Times that \\"Prejudice drove me out of baseball sooner than I should have. But I wasn't changing\\". He wrote in his autobiography that \\"prejudice just won out.\\" Burke left professional sports at the age of 27. He told People magazine in 1994 that his \\"mission as a gay ballplayer was to break a stereotype\\" and that he thought \\"it worked\\". =The high five= On October 2, 1977, Burke ran onto the field to congratulate his Dodgers teammate Dusty Baker after Baker hit his 30th home run in the last game of the regular season. Burke raised his hand over his head as Baker jogged home from third base. Not knowing what to do about the upraised hand, Baker slapped it. They have been credited with inventing the high five, an event detailed in the ESPN 30 for 30 film The High Five directed by Michael Jacobs. The high five is now widely ubiquitous. After retiring from baseball, Burke used the high five with other LGBTQ residents of the Castro district of San Francisco, where it became a symbol of gay pride and identification.  Life after Major League Baseball  Burke continued his athletic endeavors after retiring from baseball. He won medals in the 100 and 200 meter sprints in the first Gay Games in 1982 and competed in the 1986 Gay Games in basketball. His jersey number at Berkeley High School was retired in his honor. Burke played for many years in the SFGSL (San Francisco Gay Softball League), playing third base for Uncle Bert's Bombers.Bob Hartman An article published in Inside Sports magazine in 1982 made Burke's homosexuality public knowledge. Although he remained active in amateur competitions, Burke turned to drugs to fill the void in his life when his career ended. An addiction to cocaine destroyed him both physically and financially. In 1987, his leg and foot were crushed when he was hit by a car in San Francisco. After the accident, his life went into physical and financial decline. He was arrested and jailed for drugs and lived on the streets of San Francisco for a number of years, often in the same neighborhood that once embraced him. He spent his final months with his sister in Oakland. He died May 30, 1995, of AIDS complications at Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro, California, at age 42. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California. When news of his battle with AIDS became public knowledge in 1994, the Oakland Athletics organization helped to support him financially. In interviews given while he was fighting AIDS, he expressed little in the way of grudges, and only one big regret ‚Äì that he never had the opportunity to pursue a second professional sports career in basketball. In 1999, Major League Baseball player Bill Bean revealed his homosexuality, only the second Major League player to do so. Unlike Burke, who came out to teammates while he was still an active player, Bean revealed himself four years after his retirement in 1995, the year Burke died. On August 2, 2013, Burke was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame. In July 2014, Major League Baseball announced plans to honor Burke at the 2014 All-Star Game, doing so as part of a pregame press conference on July 15, 2014. The Fox broadcast in the United States did not mention Burke. On June 17, 2015, the Oakland Athletics honored Burke as part of Athletics Pride Night. Burke's brother, Sydney, threw the ceremonial first pitch at the game. Burke was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2015.\\"Shrine of the Eternals ‚Äì Inductees\\".

Biography Hofbauer began his career as an assistant director in 1950 with Der keusche Adam. His first film as a director was a sequence of the Austrian anthology film Auch M√§nner sind keine Engel ( Wiener Luft, 1959). Hofbauer's next film was a Krimi film Case 33: Antwerp in 1964 that he also wrote. He worked steadily in a variety of popular genres of the international co-productions of the time, musicals with Vivi Bach such as Holiday in St. Tropez (1964) and Tausend Takte √úbermut (1965), a Sauerkraut Western Black Eagle of Santa Fe (1965), a Eurospy film Red Dragon (1965), then moving to adult films with The Fountain of Love and Black Market of Love both in 1966; the latter with a screenplay by Hofbauer. During the early 1970s, in Munich, Hofbauer teamed with Walter Boos, Wolf C. Hartwig and Ludwig Spitaler to produce the original thirteen films under the banner Schulmadchen Report (or Schoolgirl Report); the stories were adapted from books written by G√ºnther Hunold, while G√ºnther Heller composed the film script, Klaus Werner did the camera work, and the music was handled by Gert Wilden & Orchestra. Hofbauer and Boos were referred to as the 'Titans of Teen Libido'. The films were classified as 'sexploitation', and were extremely popular, seen by more than 30 million people all over the world. In the United States, the films were released in grindhouses and drive-ins, and the names of the films were changed to conform to American standards. Because the films focused on young girls who may have been under legal age in this country, the Schoolgirl Report series was eventually suppressed.

Biography He was born at Audrehem, in the present arrondissement of Saint-Omer, in the d√©partement of Pas de Calais. Nothing is known of his career before 1332, when he is heard of at the court of Philip VI of France. Between 1332 and 1342 he went three times to Scotland to aid King David Bruce in his wars. In 1342 he became captain for the king of France in Brittany; then he seems to have served in the household of the duke of Normandy, and in 1346, as one of the defenders of Calais, was taken as a prisoner to England by Edward III. From 1349 he held an important place in the military history of France, first as captain in Angoul√™me, and in June 1351, in succession to the lord of Beaujeu, as marshal of France. In March 1352 he was appointed lieutenant for the king in the territory between the Loire and the Dordogne, in 1353 in Normandy, and in 1355 in Artois and Picardy and the Boulonnais. It was Audrehem who arrested Charles II of Navarre and his partisans, at the banquet given by the dauphin (later Charles V of France) at Rouen in 1356. At Poitiers he was one of those who advised John II of France to attack the English, and, charging into the front line of the French army, was slightly wounded and taken prisoner. From England he was several times given safe-conduct to France, and he took an active part in the negotiations for the Treaty of Bretigny, recovering his liberty at the same time as king John. In 1361, as the king's lieutenant in Languedoc, he prevented the free companies from seizing the castles, and negotiated the treaty with their chiefs under which they followed Henry, count of Trast√°mara (later Henry II of Castile), into Spain. In 1365 he joined Bertrand du Guesclin in the expedition to Spain, and was taken prisoner with him by Edward, the Black Prince at the Battle of N√°jera (Navarette) in 1367. The Black Prince recalled that he had accepted d'Audrehem parole after the battle of Poitiers and released him after d'Audrehem had giving his word that he would not bear arms against the Prince until his ransom was paid. When the Prince saw him he reproached him bitterly, and called him \\"liar and traitor\\". D'Audrehem denied that he was either, and the prince asked him whether he would submit to the judgment of a body of knights. To this d'Audrehem agreed, and after he had dined the prince chose twelve knights, four English, four Gascons, and four Bretons, to judge between himself and the marshal. After the Prince had stated his case, d'Audrehem replied that he had not broken his word, for the army the Prince led was not his own; he was merely in the pay of Peter of Castile. The knights considered that this view of the prince's position was sound, and gave their verdict for d'Audrehem. However he was unable to pay his ransom until 1369. In 1368, on account of his age, he was relieved of the office of marshal, being appointed bearer of the oriflamme, with a pension of 2,000 livres. He was sent to Spain in 1370 by Charles V of France to urge his friend du Guesclin to return to France, and in spite of his age he took part in the Battle of Pontvallain (December 1370), but fell ill and died, probably at Saumur, in the latter part of December 1370.

Southern Winds was founded by Juan Maggio, who served as president of the company.  History  Initially a domestic carrier, Southern Winds began offering connections to international flights in 1997. The airline's own international operations were authorized by the Argentine Government in 2001. At its peak, Southern Winds operated an extensive domestic network, international flights within the South American region, and intercontinental services from Buenos Aires to Miami and Madrid; and charter destinations like Florianopolis, Porto Seguro, Camboriu, Tacna and Punta Cana. Hubs were maintained in C√≥rdoba (from 1996) and Buenos Aires (from 1999). Boeing 737-200 taking off from Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, 2004 Southern Winds' fleet was composed initially by Bombardier CRJ-100/200, DeHavilland Canada DHC-8-100 and later Boeing 737, 747 and 767 passenger planes. Though the company was founded as a passenger carrier, cargo transport services under the brand SW Cargo began in 2000. In 2003 an alliance was struck between Southern Winds and the Argentine-state owned L√≠neas A√©reas Federales Sociedad An√≥nima (LAFSA) that involved utilization by LAFSA of Southern Winds' flight infrastructure. By 2004, Southern Winds was a leading commercial carrier in the troubled Argentine aviation industry. That September, however, airport police in Madrid discovered of cocaine packed in four unaccompanied suitcases aboard an arriving Southern Winds flight. The resulting scandal cost the airline its government subsidy, and ultimately resulted in the carrier's collapse. The last Southern Winds flight operated on December 5, 2005, although proposals for the airline's revival continued to surface in 2006.

The Integratron is a tall (Appears to be only 28 ft tall?) cupola structure with a diameter of designed by ufologist and contactee George Van Tassel. Van Tassel claimed the Integratron was capable of rejuvenation, anti-gravity and time travel. He built the structure in Landers, California (near Joshua Tree), following instructions that Van Tassel vehemently claimed were provided directly to him by visitors from the planet Venus. The Integratron machine was started in 1957, the structure erected in 1959. It was financed predominantly by donations, including funds from Howard Hughes. After Van Tassel's death in 1978, the building had a series of owners (and was left in various states of disrepair) before sisters Joanne, Nancy, and Patty Karl bought it in the early 2000s. The sisters promote the Integratron as an \\"acoustically perfect structure,\\" give tours and offer \\"sound baths\\" they describe as \\"...meditation-like sessions accompanied by tones from quartz bowls.\\" Construction Ceiling of the Integratron, January 2012 George Van Tassel was a former aircraft mechanic and flight inspector who moved to California's Mojave Desert to operate an airport and inn. While there, he began meditating under Giant Rock, which the Native Americans of the area held sacred. In August 1953, Van Tassel claimed he had been contacted both telepathically and later in person by people from space, who gave him a technique to rejuvenate human cell tissue. Acting on these instructions, Van Tassel began constructing the Integratron in 1954. Construction costs were partly paid for by an annual series of successful UFO conventions, the Giant Rock Spacecraft Conventions, which continued for nearly 25 years. The main structure's construction was complete circa 1959, but Van Tassel continued to work on the device until his sudden death in 1978. Claims According to Van Tassel, the Integratron's workings rely on the generation of strong \\"intermittent magnetic fields\\" resulting in the generation of plasma in the form of a coronal discharge and negative air ionization inside the building. The Integratron is based on the Multiple Wave Oscillator invented by Georges Lakhovsky. The Multiple Wave Oscillator is a combination of a high voltage Tesla coil and a split-ring resonator that generates ultra wideband electromagnetic frequencies. Van Tassel speculated that electromagnetism affects biological cells, and believed that every biological cell has a unique resonant electromagnetic frequency. According to van Tassel, the generation of strong ultra wideband EMF by the Integratron \\"resonates\\" with the cell's frequency and \\"recharges\\" the cellular structure as if it were an electrical battery. Van Tassel claimed that human cells \\"rejuvenated\\" while inside the structure. Van Tassel also claimed the Integratron is intentionally constructed atop a powerful geomagnetic anomaly and its construction is entirely of non-ferromagnetic materials, the equivalent to a modern radome. Historical marker near the Integratron The Integratron during a Sound Bath session in 2017 Modern uses After Van Tassel died, there was a proposal to turn the Integratron into a disco, but that plan was never realized. The Integratron's new owners operate it as a tourist attraction and offer \\"sound baths\\" where groups of people are \\"exposed to harmonic sound frequencies\\" produced by quartz bowls, claimed to have a deep calming effect.

Biography She was born Hilda Auerbach in New York City to Russian parents. Her father, Rachmiel Auerbach, was a doctor, and her mother, Sonia Lubove Kamenetsky, was a feminist and Labor Zionist. Her mother was born in Baku, and her father, born in Riga, was descended from Hasidic rabbis. She was a cousin of Isaiah Berlin through her father. As a child she wrote amazingly precocious work, and corresponded with William Butler Yeats. At the age of fifteen she moved to Haifa, Palestine, with her mother, and later to London to study at the University of London. She was briefly married during her time in London, and divorced. She met and corresponded later with the poet H.D., who would influence her work. At their first meeting Hilda Morley questioned H.D. about her friendship with D. H. Lawrence and H.D. said, \\"You make me feel so historical.\\" When the Blitz began in London she moved back to the United States. In 1945, she married the painter Eugene Morley. They divorced in 1949, but his connection to abstract expressionism and to the New York School of painting was a lasting influence on her poetry. She wrote major poems that are inspired by individual works of visual art. Through Eugene Morley she became friends with Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, David Smith, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning and Elaine de Kooning. Philip Guston would watch her from his studio window, and declared that she was his muse. In 1952, she married the German composer, Stefan Wolpe, who through Morley was introduced to the abstract expressionist art scene. Wolpe taught at Black Mountain College, where Morley taught as well. Morley maintained that the atmosphere at Black Mountain was not favorable to women, although she enjoyed her time there. At Black Mountain, Wolpe and Morley became close friends with John Cage, David Tudor, Merce Cunningham, Dorothea Rockburne and Robert Rauschenberg, in addition to poets Charles Olson and Robert Creeley. Wolpe and Morley traveled widely in Europe as Wolpe taught at Darmstadt and had a residency in Rome. Wolpe developed Parkinson's disease in 1964, and Morley's life was greatly affected by her need to care for him until his death in 1972. Morley's understanding of her own art was greatly influenced by her life with Wolpe and he and his music are a major theme of her work. The influence on the open construction of the poetry of Hilda Morley was not Charles Olson, but Wong May. Wong May was a young poet originally from China via Singapore. Wong May met Hilda Morley at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire during a residency there in 1969. She persuaded Morley to change her poetry using spacing and breaks for expressive effect. Morley revised her earlier poetry as well, using open construction. Morley wrote, ‚ÄúThe poem of organic form molds its phrasing and spacing to conform to the pressures of the poetic content.‚Äù It was not until 1976 (at the age of 60) that her first collection, A Blessing Outside Us, was published through the efforts of Denise Levertov. Levertov and Morley became friends in the late 1950s, and they had an extensive correspondence. Morley greatly respected Levertov as a poet, and valued her advice. Levertov wrote on Morley, ‚ÄúThe lucid, the illuminated quality of poem after poem is given them by the precision of their structure‚Ä¶the sum of the parts is, as in all the open ‚Äòsecrets‚Äô of nature and of art, beyond accounting: the duende is dark within transparence.‚Äù Morley had five volumes of poetry published within her lifetime, and another after her death. Her poetry is involved with life and living, as well as a powerful collection dealing with the death and mourning of Wolpe, \\"What Are Winds and What Are Waters\\". Morley's work has been compared to Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, and it has won critical praise and numerous prizes. Part of the force of Morley‚Äôs work is a boldness to go as far as she can within her medium. In her hands it is always an expressive personal means. In writing on Morley‚Äôs long poem ‚ÄúThe Shutter Clangs‚Äù Stanley Kunitz comments, ‚ÄúIn the poem from which the passage is taken she meditates on John Donne‚Äôs ‚ÄòGoodfriday, Riding Westward' and mounts on that meditation an oceanic spate of images pertaining to the death of her beloved ‚Äì a montage with a span of three centuries, so rich and eloquent, even in its extravagance, that it constitutes a daring tour de force. It is a vehicle that threatens on almost every page to fall apart, but in the end, out of the ‚Äòclair bones‚Äô and the dark years, the imagination seems to spread its sails and fly, ever westward, to the open water.‚Äù Hayden Carruth has written of Morley‚Äôs work, ‚Äú\\"How simple the language is, not a rhetorical gesture, not an unnecessary adjective, yet heightened by interweaving lines, cadences, and tones, by urgency of feeling and fineness of perception. We have these expressive works, indispensable to what we call American literature.‚Äù \\"Morley manages to speak clearly and sparely of what is least sayable: the sense that we inhabit a living web, not as separate beings but as molecules of a larger and elastic whole,\\" wrote Geoffrey O'Brien in The Village Voice. After living in New York for three decades Morley moved to Sag Harbor on Long Island for most of her last decade. In 1997, she returned to London, which had been a longtime wish, where she died on March 23, 1998 after a fall.

The moors and Baglan Bay are to the southwest. The village contains a number of historical buildings such as Baglan House, St. Catharine's Church, and St. Baglan's Church. The first St. Baglan's Church is now a shell after a fire in 1954. St. Catharine's Church was designed by Welsh architect John Prichard, an exponent of the neo-Gothic style and dedicated in 1882. Baglan House was one of the seats of the Villiers family, earls of Jersey.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales.

According to tradition the church was founded by the aforementioned St Baglan. In the medieval period, the church (dedicated to St Baglan) was rebuilt seemingly on the same site.P R Davies & S Lloyd-Ferne (1990), Lost Churches of Wales & the Marches, Sutton, p30, The church burnt down in 1954 although ruins still exist at the top of the churchyard of St Catharine's church. There was a medieval castle within the parish boundary which is known by the name 'Plas Baglan'. This is sited above the Baglan Brook and is heavily overgrown (and not readily accessible).

He has made numerous key contributions to the study of mammalian fertilization. He is a pioneer of assisted fertilization technologies such as in vitro fertilization and direct sperm injection into egg (commonly called intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI) which are widely used today in human infertility clinics throughout the world. He was also a pioneer in the cloning field. In 1997 his laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa successfully cloned mice using the Honolulu technique. The first one was a female named Cumulina from the cells that surround the developing ovarian follicle in mice. Early and later years Yanagimachi was born in Ebetsu and raised in Sapporo, Japan.Ryuzo Yanagimachi - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica He received a BS in zoology in 1952 and a DSc in animal embryology in 1960 both from Hokkaido University. He then taught a high school a year and a junior college for another year because he could not find a research position. Yanagimachi applied for a post-doctoral position with Dr. M. C. Chang of the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. He got this position and there discovered how to fertilize hamster eggs \\"in vitro.\\" This work led to in vitro fertilization of eggs of human and other mammalian species. In 1964 he returned to Hokkaido University as a temporary lecturer with the possibility of later being appointed to an assistant professorship. However, another person eventually got the position. In 1966 Yanagimachi ended up at the University of Hawaii as an assistant professor and has become a full professor of department of anatomy and reproductive biology at the John A. Burns School of Medicine. After working for 38 years at the University of Hawaii, he retired the end of 2005 to become a professor emeritus, but keeps working with junior fellows. He is married to Hiroko, a former child psychologist. She could not find work in her field when they came to the U.S. due to a language barrier, so she went to work with researchers in his lab as an electron microscopist. Cloning In July 1998 the Yanagimachi's team published work in Nature on cloning mice from adult cells. Yanagimachi named the new cloning technique they had created to do this work the \\"Honolulu technique\\". The first mouse born was named Cumulina, after the cumulus cells whose nuclei were used to clone her. At the time of the publication of this work over fifty mice spanning three generations had been produced through this technique. This work was done by an international team of scientists dubbed \\"Team Yanagimachi\\" or \\"Team Yana\\" for short. This team included co-authors Teruhiko \\"Teru\\" Wakayama (also a native of Japan), Anthony \\"Tony\\" Perry (United Kingdom), Maurizio Zuccotti (Italy), and K. R. Johnson (United States). The Yanagimachi laboratory moved from the warehouse which had housed it for over thirty years into the newly created Institute for Biogenesis Research in the Biomedical Sciences Tower of the John A. Burns School of Medicine. Money and renown from the opportunities opened up by the Nature article made the institute possible. The Yanagimachi laboratory and his former associates continued to make advances in cloning. The first male animal cloned from adult cells was announced in 1999. In 2004 the laboratory participated in the cloning of an infertile male mouse. This advance may be used to produce many infertile animals for use in research in human infertility. Mice cloned by the Honolulu technique were displayed at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii, and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois. Major work before and after 1960 As a graduate student of Hokkaido University in Japan Yanagimachi studied fish (herring) fertilization and the sexual organization of rhizocephalans (parasitic barnacles). In fish, he discovered calcium-dependent, chemotactic movement of spermatozoa into the micropyle through which the fertilizing spermatozoon enters the egg. This was the first discovery of sperm chemotaxis in vertebrate animals. In rhizocephala, he found that adults are not hermaphroditic as generally thought, but bisexual. So-called \\"testis\\" in an adult animal is a receptacle of cells from larval males. This discovery revolutionized biological studies of rhizocephalans and related animals. While he was at the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research as a Dr. M.C. Chang's postdoctoral fellow (1960-1964), he witnessed and recorded the entire process of sperm penetration through the zona pellucida and fusion with the egg proper in living (hamster) egg, which was the first in mammals. He was one of few who began to study the process and mechanisms of mammalian fertilization using in vitro fertilization technique. Throughout his career he has made numerous, fundamental contributions to our understanding of mammalian fertilization and to the development of assisted fertilization technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) which are widely used today in human infertility clinics throughout the world. His comprehensive review of the basic biology of \\"Mammalian Fertilization\\" published in 1994 (In: Physiology of Reproduction, Knobil & Neill eds, Ravan Press) is classic. Yanagimachi himself consider that \\"cloned mice\\" were byproducts of fertilization study and that the production of cloned animals in various species triggered/accelerated the research on the genomic reprogramming of adult somatic (body) cell nuclei as well as the production of pluripotent stem cells from adult cells for therapeutic purposes. He retired in 2005, but continues working on natural and assisted reproduction. In 2014 he had an interview with The Prism in which he was quoted saying: > Unlike people, nature never lies.

Close-up of the cowling on the Curtiss AT-5A. The NACA cowling is a type of aerodynamic fairing used to streamline radial engines installed on airplanes. It was developed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1927. It was a major advance in aerodynamic drag reduction, and paid for its development and installation costs many times over due to the gains in fuel efficiency that it enabled. History and design The NACA cowling enhanced speed through drag reduction while delivering improved engine cooling. The idea that the NACA cowling produced thrust through the Meredith effectMeredith, F. W: \\"Cooling of Aircraft Engines. With Special Reference To Ethylene Glycol Radiators Enclosed In Ducts\\", Aeronautical Research Council R&M; 1683, 1936. is fallacious‚Äîalthough in theory the expansion of the air as it was heated by the engine could create some thrust by exiting at high speed, in practice this required a cowling designed and shaped to achieve the high speed exit of air required (which the NACA cowling was not), and in any case, at 1930s airspeeds, the effect was negligible.Becker, J.; The high-speed frontier: Case histories of four NACA programs, 1920- SP-445, NASA (1980), Chapter 5: High-speed Cowlings, Air Inlets and Outlets, and Internal-Flow Systems: The ramjet investigation The cowling constitutes a symmetric, circular airfoil, in contrast to the planar airfoil of wings. It directs cool air to flow through the engine where it is routed across the engine's hottest parts, that is, the cylinders and heads. Furthermore, turbulence after the air passes the free-standing cylinders is greatly reduced. The sum of all these effects reduces drag by as much as 60 percent. The test conclusions resulted in almost every radial-engined aircraft being equipped with this cowling, starting in 1932.Full-Scale Testing of N.A.C.A. Cowlings (Theodore Theodorsen, M. J.

The lead ship, R.33, served successfully for ten years and survived one of the most alarming and heroic incidents in airship history when she was torn from her mooring mast in a gale. She was called a \\"Pulham Pig\\" by the locals, as the blimps based there had been, and is immortalised in the village sign for Pulham St Mary. The only other airship in the class, R.34, became the first aircraft to make an east to west transatlantic flight in July 1919 and, with the return flight made the first two-way crossing. It was decommissioned two years later, after being damaged during a storm. The crew nicknamed her \\"Tiny\\". Design and development Substantially larger than the preceding R31 class, the R.33 class was in the design stage in 1916 when the German Zeppelin LZ 76 (L 33) was brought down on English soil. Despite the efforts of the crew to set it on fire, it was captured nearly intact, with engines in working order. For five months, the LZ 76 was carefully examined in order to discover the Germans' secrets. The existing design was adapted to produce a new airship based on the German craft and two examples were ordered, one (R.33) to be constructed by Armstrong-Whitworth at Barlow, North Yorkshire, and the other (R.34) by William Beardmore and Company in Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, Scotland. Assembly began in 1918. The R.33 class was semi-streamlined fore and aft, the middle section being straight-sided. The control car was well forward on the ship, with the aft section containing an engine in a separate structure to stop vibrations affecting the sensitive radio direction finding and communication equipment. The small gap was faired over, so the gondola seemed to be a single structure.Higham 1961, p.181 It was powered by five Sunbeam Maori engines, with one in the aft section of the control car, two more in a pair of power cars amidships each driving a pusher propeller via a reversing gearbox for manoeuvering while mooring, and the remaining two in a centrally mounted aft car, geared together to drive a single pusher propeller.Some Notes on the Transatlantic Voyage of R.33 Flight 3 July 1919, pp. 888‚Äì91 Operational history =R.33= The pair of Gloster Grebes under the airship before the test, 26 October 1926 R33 near its hangar R.33 first flew on 6 March 1919, and was sent to RAF Pulham in Norfolk. Between then and 14 October, R.33 made 23 flights totalling 337 hours flying time. One of these, a flight promoting \\"Victory Bonds\\" even included a brass band playing in the top machine gun post. In 1920 she was \\"demilitarised\\" and given over to civilian work with the civil registration G-FAAG. This work consisted of trials of new mast mooring techniques using the mast erected at Pulham. On one occasion winds of were successfully withstood while moored. Another experiment was an ascent carrying a pilotless Sopwith Camel which was successfully launched over the Yorkshire Moors. After an overhaul, R33 was based at Croydon Airport, moored to a portable mast. In June 1921 it was used by the Metropolitan Police to observe traffic at The Derby, and in July she appeared in the Hendon Air Pageant before flying to Cardington, Bedfordshire, where she was laid up for three years. On 31 May 1921 the British government cancelled all airship development for financial reasons.Higham 1961, p. 198 Military airships were scrapped, but as a civilian airship R.33 was mothballed instead. In 1925, after being inactive for nearly four years, the reconditioned R.33 emerged from her shed at Cardington. At 09:50 on 16 April 1925 the R.33 was torn from the mast at Pulham during a gale and was carried away with only a partial crew of 20 men on board. Her nose partially collapsed and the first gas cell deflated leaving her low in the bow. The crew on board started the engines, gaining some height, and rigged a cover for the bow section, but the R.33 was blown out over the North Sea. A Royal Navy vessel was readied and left the nearby port of Lowestoft in case the R.33 came down in the sea. The local lifeboat was launched, but was driven back by the weather conditions. Some five hours after the initial break from the mast, R.33 was under control but still being blown towards the Continent. As she approached the Dutch coast R.33 was given the option of landing at De Kooy, where a party of 300 men was standing by.R.33's Night Out Flight 23 April 1925, pp-246-9 Late in the evening R.33 was able to hold her position over the Dutch coast, hovering there until 5 o'clock the next morning. She was then able to slowly make her way back home, arriving at the Suffolk coast eight hours later and reaching Pulham at 13:50 hrs, where she was put into the shed alongside the R36. For their actions the airship's first officer, who had been in command, Lieutenant Ralph Booth was awarded the Air Force Cross, the coxswain, Flight-Sergeant \\"Sky\\" Hunt, was awarded the Air Force Medal, four other crew members were awarded the British Empire Medal and the other crew members were presented with inscribed watches.R.33 Awards Flight 21 May 1925. p. 307 The forward section of R.33 control car at RAF Museum (Hendon), 2008 In October 1925, following repairs, she was used for experiments to provide data for the construction of the R101 airship. Once these were finished, in mid-October, she was used for trials launching a parasite fighter, using a DH 53 Hummingbird light aircraft. After some near misses, a successful launch and recapture was achieved in December that year. The following year she launched a pair of Gloster Grebes weighing about a ton apiece, the first of which was flown by Flying Officer Campbell MacKenzie-Richards.The Times (22 October 1926). She was then sent to the sheds at Pulham where she was finally broken up in 1928, after severe metal fatigue was found in her frame. The forward portion of R.33's control car is on display at the RAF Museum at Hendon. =R.34= R.34 made her first flight on 14 March 1919 and was delivered to her service base at East Fortune on 29 May after a 21-hour flight from Inchinnan. R.34 had set out the previous evening, but thick fog made navigation difficult, and after spending the night over the North Sea the airship was unable to moor in the morning due to fog. After cruising as far south as Yorkshire R.34 returned to East Fortune to dock at about 3 p.m. The airship made her first endurance trip of 56 hours over the Baltic from 17 to 20 June. It was then decided to attempt the first return Atlantic crossing, under the command of Major George Scott.Scott was killed in the R101 crash R.34 had never been intended as a passenger carrier and extra accommodation was arranged by slinging hammocks in the keel walkway. A plate was welded to an engine exhaust pipe to allow for the preparation of hot food. The crew included Brigadier-General Edward Maitland and Zachary Lansdowne as the representative of the US Navy. William Ballantyne, one of the crew members scheduled to stay behind to save weight, stowed away with the crew's mascot, a small tabby kitten called \\"Wopsie\\"; they emerged at 2.00 p.m. on the first day, too late to be dropped off. The wreck of the R.34 at Howden in January 1921 R.34 left Britain on 2 July 1919 and arrived at Mineola, Long Island, United States, on 6 July after a flight of 108 hours with virtually no fuel left.The Transatlantic Voyage of R.34 Flight 10 July 1919, pp. 906‚Äì10 As the landing party had no experience of handling large rigid airships, Major E. M. Pritchard jumped by parachute and so became the first person to reach American soil by air from Europe. This was the first East-West aerial crossing of the Atlantic and was achieved weeks after the first transatlantic aeroplane flight. The return journey to RNAS Pulham took place from 10 to 13 July and took 75 hours. Returned to East Fortune for a refit, R.34 then flew to Howden, East Yorkshire, for crew training. On 27 January 1921 R.34 set off on what should have been a routine exercise. Over the North Sea the weather worsened and a recall signal sent by radio was not received. Following a navigational error the craft flew into a hillside on the North Yorkshire Moors during the night, and the ship lost two propellers. She went back out to sea using the two remaining engines and in daylight followed the Humber Estuary back to Howden. Strong winds made it impossible to get her back into the shed, and she was tied down outside for the night. By the morning further damage had occurred and R.34 was written off and scrapped.

The company was founded by J.J.and F.H. Roshek. In its prime, Roshek's was the primary shopping destination in Dubuque and was the largest department store in the state of Iowa. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Interior of Roshek's, July, 2016 History Roshek's operated for more than 40 years in a 9-story building at 700 Locust Street in Dubuque. The building was built in two halves beginning in August 1929. Originally the whole building was to be finished within a year, but as of the fall of 1931, only the north half was finished. Wholly completed in 1932, the building is a block long and half a block wide and is the tallest building in Dubuque. It replaced two four-story buildings, the former Rider- Wallis dry goods building, located on the south half of the same block (demolished to complete this building), and a smaller four-story Roshek building across the alley immediately east, which was located on the southwest corner of Eighth and Main streets, which was later occupied by Montgomery Ward. The building's architect was Charles Wheeler Nicol (1888-1953), a noted regional designer of major hotels and school buildings. This was and remains the state's largest building to be used as a department store. Other department stores were also located downtown. In the 1960s, prior to the construction of Kennedy Mall, Stampfer's was on the northeast corner of Eighth and Main streets. J.C. Penney was on the west side of Main Street, just north of Stampfer's. In the 1960s Roshek's decided to move their operations to smaller quarters at Kennedy Mall, a regional shopping center on the western edge of the city. Roshek's became one of the mall's anchor tenants, along with Montgomery Ward and Younkers, a Des Moines department store which made its first appearance in Dubuque when the mall was built. The new Roshek's store opened in 1970. The Roshek family subsequently sold the store to Gamble- Skogmo, Inc. The store closed in 1982. Today what was originally Roshek's space in the mall is occupied by two other department stores, Sears and Younkers. After Roshek's moved from downtown, the former department store was converted into an office building. For most of the time since conversion, it has been known as the Dubuque Building, except for a period of several years when it was called CyCare Plaza. Now it is called the Roshek Building. On January 15, 2009, IBM announced that it will move into the building, creating a new technology service center with 1,300 employees after improving the building to make it a LEED-certified building IBM Aims to Bring 1,300 High- Tech Jobs to Dubuque, Iowa The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 2010.

They played in Binghamton, New York, United States at the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena. The team logo was designed by Johnny Hart, artist of the comic strip \\"B.C.\\" and a Binghamton native. History The Dusters played in the NAHL, which served as the inspiration for the movie Slap Shot, which includes a \\"Broome County\\" team. One scene in the film was specifically drawn from events that occurred in Binghamton. In the movie, the Hanson brothers wear black-rimmed, Coke-bottle eyeglasses, and in one game, get into a fight immediately after the opening faceoff. In reality, both Jeff and Steve Carlson of the Johnstown Jets wore similar glasses, and did get into a long fight right after an opening faceoff. Johnstown Coach Dick Roberge told the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat, \\"We got into Binghamton about two or three weeks before the playoffs. In the team warmup, we're out there and all the Binghamton players came out with the plastic glasses and big noses, every one of them, poking fun at the Carlson brothers. We went back in the dressing room and the boys said, 'Coach, as soon as that puck is dropped, we're pairing up.' We had one heckuva fight. They went about 30 minutes until everyone got tired. We met them again in the finals (1974‚Äì75) and beat them four straight.\\" When the NAHL folded in 1977, the team was replaced by the Binghamton Dusters of the American Hockey League who previously operated as the Providence Reds.

She was the coach of the England women's national football team and the Great Britain women's Olympic football team until August 2013. As a player, Powell won 66 caps for England, mainly as an attacking midfielder, scoring 35 goals. She made her England debut at the age of 16, and went on to play in the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, England's first World Cup appearance. She was also vice-captain of her country. At club level Powell played in four FA Women's Cup finals and captained Croydon to a League and Cup double in 1996. The Football Association (FA) appointed Powell as England's first-ever full-time national coach in 1998. She led the team at the 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2013 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship. After failing to qualify in 2003, she guided England to the quarter-finals of the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2007 and 2011. England's best results, reaching the final of the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009, both featured Powell. She was a player at the former and coach at the latter. As well as managing the England senior team, Powell oversaw the whole structure from Under-15s to the Under-23s, a coach mentoring scheme and The FA‚Äôs National Player Development Centre at Loughborough University. In May 2009 Powell's administration implemented central contracts, to help players focus on full-time training and playing, without having to fit it around full-time employment. Initially 17 players signed contracts. In 2003 Powell became the first woman to achieve the UEFA Pro Licence‚Äîthe highest coaching qualification available. Club career =Millwall= Powell made newspaper headlines when FA rules banned her from representing her school team beyond the age of 11. The teacher running the team had appealed the ban, not, according to Powell, because he was interested in gender equality, but because of a pragmatic desire to field his strongest team. Powell moved on to play club football for Millwall Lionesses when she reached 11. At Millwall Lionesses Powell came under the influence of coach Alan May. A senior manager with British Telecom, May taught Powell people management skills and remained a major inspiration throughout her career, including when she moved into coaching herself. May was employed as Powell's head scout when she became England manager. =Fulham= As the club grew to be one of the most successful in England, Powell left for London rivals Friends of Fulham. A two-year spell with Friends of Fulham culminated in an appearance at the 1989 Women's FA Cup final. Powell scored twice and is reported to have played exceptionally well, but her team were beaten 3‚Äì2 by Leasowe Pacific. The match was played at Old Trafford but attracted only 914 spectators, although it was also broadcast on Channel 4. =Return to Millwall= In the aftermath of that defeat Powell returned to Millwall Lionesses, where she became the team's all-time record goalscorer. In 1991 they reached the Women's FA Cup final and beat Doncaster Belles 1‚Äì0 at Prenton Park to win the Cup for the first time. Millwall Lionesses also won the Greater London League to qualify for the inaugural National Division in 1991‚Äì92. =Bromley and Croydon= The team broke up in the aftermath of that success and Powell moved with teammate Sue Law to form a new club Bromley Borough. Beginning in the South East Counties League, the club quickly progressed through the divisions. After adding England player Brenda Sempare in 1992, Bromley Borough won all 16 matches in the South East Counties League Division One, scoring 142 goals in the process. The team also reached the semi final of the Women's FA Cup, where they lost 2‚Äì0 to treble-winning Arsenal. In 1993‚Äì94 Bromley Borough won the National League Division One South by ten points, securing promotion into the top flight of English women's football. Although they were handed a chastening 10‚Äì1 defeat by Doncaster Belles in the fifth round of the FA Women's Cup. For 1994‚Äì95 the club entered a partnership with Croydon FC and enlisted Powell's England teammate Debbie Bampton as manager. Powell was one of six Croydon players who represented England at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. With Powell as captain and Bampton as player- manager, Croydon won a domestic double in 1995‚Äì96. In the FA Women's Cup final against Liverpool at The Den, Powell equalised Karen Burke's opening goal then scored from the spot as Croydon won a penalty shootout. A farcical end of season fixture backlog saw Croydon play five games in ten days, winning four and drawing one to erode Doncaster Belles' 13-point lead and win the National Premier Division on goal difference. In 1997‚Äì98 Croydon lost both domestic Cup finals to Arsenal. The 1998 FA Women's Cup final was lost 3‚Äì2 and, despite scoring Croydon's second goal, Powell missed out on her third winners' medal. She had agreed to take over as England coach and retired from playing. International career Martin Reagan gave Powell her England debut against Republic of Ireland, in a 6‚Äì0 Euro qualifying win staged at Elm Park in Reading, Berkshire on 9 September 1983. Aged 17, Powell played in the final of the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football as England were beaten by Sweden on penalties. The two-legged final had seen England recover a one goal deficit at Kenilworth Road in Luton, in muddy conditions described by Powell as \\"absolutely shocking.\\" Managerial career =First steps into coaching= Powell had passed the FA's preliminary coaching award at the age of 19. During her later playing career she had worked as a development officer for Lewisham London Borough Council and in Crystal Palace FC's community outreach scheme. She had also been a volunteer coach at soccer camps in the United States. Ted Copeland encouraged Powell to complete the FA's new female coach mentoring scheme and obtain her 'B' licence while she was still playing. =England Women= England were unfortunate to be drawn in a 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification group with Norway and Germany, the reigning World and European champions, respectively. Copeland quit as manager after a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Germany at The Den in March 1998, which Powell had started. At 31 Powell became the youngest ever coach of any English national football team, as well as the first woman and the first non-white person to hold the office. On 26 July 1998 Powell managed England for the first time in a friendly against Sweden at Victoria Road, Dagenham. After entering the game as a substitute, Swedish debutant Malin Mostr√∂m scored the only goal on 84 minutes. Powell's first competitive fixture in charge was the 2‚Äì0 defeat to Norway in Lillestr√∏m the following month, which consigned England to last place in the group and meant they faced a relegation play-off against Romania. Had England lost they faced being demoted to B level and therefore unable to qualify for major tournaments. Powell described the situation as \\"very much do-or-die\\" since a substantial reduction in funding was at stake. A 6‚Äì2 aggregate victory kept England's place among the elite. In 2003 Powell became the first woman to be awarded the UEFA Pro Licence, studying alongside Stuart Pearce. She had become England coach in 1998, and led the national team to the final of Euro 2009 where they lost to Germany. It was speculated that Powell would become the first female manager in English men's football when she was linked with the vacant managerial role at Grimsby Town in October 2009, however caretaker manager Neil Woods was appointed on a permanent basis. At the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, England suffered a quarter-final penalty shootout defeat to France following a 1‚Äì1 draw. Powell controversially attributed \\"cowardice\\" to the players who had failed to volunteer to take a penalty.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/10/hope-powell-england- women-world-cup After England's disastrous showing at UEFA Women's Euro 2013, there was a clamour for Powell to be sacked. However, despite the first round exit, she retained the support of the FA. In July 2013 Keith Boanas made an outspoken attack on Powell's record as England manager and publicly called on her to resign. As he had also applied for the job in 1998, but was not granted an interview, Boanas suspected that the selection of the relatively unqualified Powell was \\"a political appointment to cover all bases\\". He criticised Powell's role in the international retirement of his wife Pauline Cope and suggested that anyone could match or surpass Powell's achievements, given a similar level of support. On 20 August 2013, Powell was sacked as manager of the England women's team. =Brighton & Hove Albion= Hope as Brighton manager in April 2018 On 19 July 2017, Brighton & Hove Albion announced that Powell had been appointed as first-team manager of the club's women's team. Honours Powell was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2002 and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.Zeta-Jones joins cricket buffs Duckworth and Lewis on honours list In 2003, she was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of her talents.

In August, 2010, she was named in 68th place on The Independent newspaper‚Äôs annual Pink List of influential LGBT people in the UK. Her entry was subsequently redacted from the online version of the article and her name was absent from the 2011 and 2012 lists. Powell was included in a rival World Pride Power List compiled by Square Peg Media in association with The Guardian; reaching fifth place in 2011 and 48th place in 2012. Commenting about her relationships with men, she said they were \\"intrigued\\" to discover that she was a footballer. In an October 2005 interview with Diva magazine, Powell commented about lesbians in football: \\"There's always been that stereotyping of female footballers as butch, dykey and unattractive, so maybe it's just best left alone.\\" Powell's autobiography, Hope: My Life in Football, was published in 2016.

Ten years later, however, upon his marriage with Ursula, a daughter of the Ascanian duke Francis I of Saxe- Lauenburg, he had to waive all rights and claims and was compensated with the small Dannenberg lordship. Moreover, he received an annual payment and had reserved the inheritance right of his descendants should the Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel line become extinct. Augustus was the seventh and youngest child from the marriage of Henry and Ursula. With little chance to take up any rule in the Brunswick lands, he concentrated on his studies in Rostock, T√ºbingen, and Stra√üburg. Afterwards, he travelled on a Grand Tour through Italy, France, the Netherlands, and England. Back in Germany at the age of 25, he took his residence in Hitzacker, where he spent the next three decades with a small court, continuing his studies. Succession arose in the midst of the Thirty Years' War, when the last Wolfenb√ºttel prince, Duke Frederick Ulrich of Brunswick-L√ºneburg died without heirs in 1634. After lengthy and complicated negotiations with his reluctant Welf relatives and an intervention by Emperor Ferdinand II, it was finally agreed that Augustus should inherit the Wolfenb√ºttel principality. Because of the ongoing war, he had to stay at Dankwarderode Castle in Braunschweig and could not move to his residence until 1644. Soon after, Augustus instituted a number of government reforms, and founded the Bibliotheca Augusta (now the Herzog August Bibliothek). After the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the Wolfenb√ºttel lands recovered quickly under his capable rule. Augustus in his library, engraving by Conrad Buno, about 1650 Augustus was a promoter of German as language of literature. Under the pseudonym Gustavus Selenus, he wrote a book on chess in 1616, Chess or the King's Game, and a standard reference on cryptography in 1624: Cryptomenytices et Cryptographiae libri IX (Gustavi Seleni). The pseudonym itself is a cryptic reference to his name, Gustavus anagrams (with U=V) to Augustus, the surname is a play on the Greek goddess of the moon (Selene). The book on cryptography is largely based on earlier works by Johannes Trithemius. The duke employed the scholar Justus Georg Schottel as tutor of his sons; he also kept an active correspondence with Johannes Valentinus Andreae, a founder of the esoteric Rosicrucianism movement. In 1632 he met with Prince Louis I of Anhalt-K√∂then and joined his Fruitbearing Society. Augustus died at Wolfenb√ºttel and was succeeded by his eldest son Rudolph Augustus. Marriage and children Statue of Duke Augustus on the Wolfenb√ºttel market square In December 1607 he married Clara Maria of Pomerania-Barth, the eldest daughter of the Griffin duke Bogislaw XIII of Pomerania. The marriage produced two stillborn children. Clara Maria died in February 1623. In October 1623 he married Dorothea of Anhalt-Zerbst, daughter of the Ascanian prince Rudolph of Anhalt-Zerbst. They had the following children: * Henry August (1625‚Äì1627) * Rudolph Augustus (1627‚Äì1704), Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel : married firstly, in 1650 Countess Christiane Elisabeth of Barby (1634-1681) : married secondly, in 1681 Rosine Elisabeth Menthe (1663-1701) * Sibylle Ursula (1629‚Äì1671) : married in 1663 Duke Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Gl√ºcksburg (1627-1698, son of Philip, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg) * Klara Auguste (1632‚Äì1700) : married in 1653 Duke Frederick of W√ºrttemberg- Neuenstadt (1615-1682) * Anton Ulrich (1633‚Äì1714), Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel : married in 1656 princess Elisabeth Juliane of Schleswig- Holstein-Norburg (1634-1704). Dorothea died in September 1634 and in 1635 Augustus married Duchess Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg, daughter of Duke John Albert II of Mecklenburg. They had two surviving children: * Ferdinand Albert I (1636-1687), Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg : married in 1667 Christine of Hesse-Eschwege (1649-1702) * Marie Elisabeth (1638-1687) : married firstly, in 1663 Adolf William, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach : married secondly, in 1676 Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg.

It includes the offices of the mayor of Boston and the Boston City Council. The current hall was built in 1968 to assume the functions of the Old City Hall. It is a controversial and prominent example of Brutalist architecture, part of the modernist movement. It was designed by Kallmann McKinnell & Knowles (architects) with Campbell, Aldrich & Nulty (architects) and LeMessurier Consultants (engineers). Archived guided tour pamphlet for Boston City Hall, published by Boston City Council Together with the surrounding plaza, City Hall is part of the Government Center complex. This project constituted a major urban redesign effort in the 1960s, as Boston demolished an area of substandard housing and businesses. The building has been subject to nearly universal public condemnation, and is often called one of the world's ugliest buildings. Calls for the structure to be demolished have been regularly made even before construction was finished. Architects and critics considered it to be excellent work, with one poll finding that professional architects describe Boston City Hall as one of the ten proudest achievements of American architecture. Synopsis of AIA Polls Design Dock Square and Congress Street, 2017 A view from the north Boston City Hall was designed by Gerhard Kallmann, a Columbia University professor, and Michael McKinnell, a Columbia graduate student, (who co-founded Kallmann McKinnell & Knowles). In 1962 they won an international, two-stage design competition for the building. Their design, selected from 256 entries by a jury of prominent architects and businessmen, departed from the more conventional designs of most of the other entries (typified by pure geometrical forms clad with sleek curtain walls) to introduce an articulated structure that expressed the internal functions of the buildings in rugged, cantilevered concrete forms. While hovering over the broad brick plaza, the City Hall was designed to create an open and accessible place for the city's government, with the most heavily used public activities all located on the lower levels directly connected to the plaza. The major civic spaces, including the Council chamber, library, and Mayor's office, were one level up, and the administrative offices were housed above these, behind the repetitive brackets of the top floors. At a time when monumentality was typically considered an appropriate attribute for governmental architecture, the architects sought to create a bold statement of modern civic democracy, placed within the historic city of Boston. While the architects looked to precedents by Le Corbusier, especially the monastery of Sainte Marie de La Tourette, with its cantilevered upper floors, exposed concrete structure, and a similar interpretation of public and private spaces, they also drew from the example of Medieval and Renaissance Italian town halls and public spaces, as well as from the bold granite structures of 19th-century Boston (including Alexander Parris' Quincy Market immediately to the east).\\"The New Boston: City Hall,\\" Charles W. Millard, The Hudson Review Vol. 23, No. 1 (Spring, 1970), pp. 110-115 Many of the elements in the design have been seen as abstractions of classical design elements, such as the coffers and the architrave above the concrete columns. Kallmann, McKinnell, and Knowles collaborated with two other Boston architectural firms and one engineering firm to form the \\"Architects and Engineers for the Boston City Hall\\" as the entity responsible for construction, which took place from 1963 to 1968. Boston City Hall, circa 1968 City Hall construction, circa 1964-1968 Boston City Hall, 1981 The architects designed City Hall as divided into three sections, aesthetically and also by use. The lowest portion of the building, the brick-faced base, which is partially built into a hillside, consists of four levels of the departments of city government, where the public has wide access. The brick largely transfers over to the exterior of this section, and it is joined by materials such as quarry tile inside. The use of these terra cotta products relates to the building's location on one of the original slopes of Boston, expressed in the open, brick-paved plaza, and also to historic Boston's brick architecture, seen in the adjoining Sears Crescent block and the Blackstone Block buildings across Congress Street. The intermediate portion of City Hall houses the public elected officials: the Mayor, the City Council members, and the Council Chamber. The large scale and the protrusion of these interior spaces on the outside, instead of being buried deep within the building, reveal the important public functions to the passers-by and are intended to create a visual and symbolic connection between the city and its government. The effect is of a small city of concrete-sheltered structures cantilevered above the plaza: large forms that house important civic activities. The cantilevers are supported by exterior columns, spaced alternately at and , which are steel- reinforced. The upper stories contain the city's office space, which are used by civil servants not visited frequently by the public, such as the administrative and planning departments. The bureaucratic nature is reflected in the standardized window patterns, separated by pre-cast concrete fins, with an open office plan typical of modern office buildings. (The subsequent enclosure of much of this space into separate offices contributed to the ventilation problems of those floors.) The top of the brick base was designed as an elevated courtyard melding the fourth floor of the city hall with the plaza. Security concerns caused city officials in recent years to block access to the courtyard and the outdoor stairways to Congress Street and the plaza. The courtyard is occasionally opened up for events (such as the celebration of the Boston Celtics championship in 1986). After 9/11, security was further increased. The north entrance, facing the plaza, was barricaded with jersey barriers and bicycle racks. All visitors entering the front and the back entrances must pass through metal detectors. City Hall was constructed by using mainly cast-in-place and precast Portland cement concrete and some masonry. About half of the concrete used in the building was precast (roughly 22,000 separate components), and the other half was poured-in-place concrete. All of the concrete in the structure, except that of the columns, is mixed with a light, coarse rock. While the majority of the building is created using concrete, precast and poured-in-place concrete are distinguishable by their different colors and textures. For example, cast-in-place elements are coarse and grainy textured because the concrete was poured into fir wood frames to mold it, and precast elements, such as trusses and supports, were set in steel molds to gain smooth, clean surfaces. This distinction also originates from the different types of cement used: the exterior poured-in-place pieces are of type I cement, a lightly colored cement, while the exterior precast components use type II cement, a dark-colored cement. The base of the building is dark with brick, Welsh quarry tiles, mahogany walls, and darker concrete. As the building ascends, the overall color lightens, as lighter concrete is used.  Reception  The public response to Boston City Hall continues to be sharply divided. Arguments for and against continued use of the structure provoke strong counter-arguments from politicians, local press, design professionals, and the general public. City Hall was given two stars by the Michelin Green Guide, which said that the building \\"has been one of Boston's controversial architectural statements since its completion in 1968.\\" The building's 50th anniversary in 2019 prompted both positive and negative commentary. John Collins and Archbishop Richard Cardinal Cushing at the groundbreaking for the new city hall = Positive = While assessment of the building's architecture has been influenced by the vagaries of changing architectural style, the building at the time was acclaimed by some architects as well as by the professional association, American Institute of Architects, which gave the building its Honor Award in 1969. Representative of the contemporary praise was the opinion of The New York Times critic Ada Louise Huxtable, who wrote that \\"in this focal building Boston sought, and got, excellence.\\" Historian Walter Muir Whitehill wrote that > \\"it is as fine a building for its time and place as Boston has ever > produced. Traditionalists who long for a revival of Bulfinch simply do not > realize that one does not achieve a handsome monster either by enlarging, or > endlessly multiplying, the attractive elements of smaller structures.\\" Architect, educator, and writer Donlyn Lyndon wrote in The Boston Globe, \\"Boston City Hall carries an authority that results from the clarity, articulation, and intensity of imagination with which it has been formed.\\" Architectural historian Douglass Shand-Tucci, author of Built in Boston: City and Suburb, 1800‚Äì2000, called City Hall \\"one of America's foremost landmarks\\" and \\"arguably the great building of twentieth-century Boston.\\" In the AIA Guide to Boston, Susan and Michael Southworth wrote that \\"the award-winning City Hall had established its architect's reputation and inspired similar buildings across the nation.\\" Stylistically, City Hall is considered by some to be a leading example of Brutalist architecture. It is listed among the \\"Greatest Buildings\\" by Great Buildings Online, an affiliate of Architecture Week. Additionally, in a 1976 Bicentennial poll of historians and architects regarding the United States' greatest buildings, sponsored by the American Institute of Architects, Boston City Hall received the sixth-most mentions. When Boston's Mayor Menino stirred controversy in 2010 with a discussion of selling City Hall (see below), opponents of the proposal expressed praise of the building for its influence, design originality, and symbolism as a marker of Boston's rebirth in the 1960s. Supporters of the building applied to the Boston Landmarks Commission for its designation as a landmark, with supporting signatures and letters from architecture critic Jane Holtz Kay, Friends of the Public Garden President Henry Lee, and others. The Boston Globe published editorials recognizing the building's importance. Architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote an article published in The Wall Street Journal in which she contrasted the poor treatment of Boston City Hall with Yale University's recent sympathetic restoration of its similarly challenging Brutalist landmark, the Art and Architecture Building by architect Paul Rudolph. In 2009 a major exhibition of the original design drawings for City Hall, now part of the archive of Historic New England, was mounted at the Wentworth Institute of Technology.Wolf, Gary, \\"Inventing a City Hall\\" Historic New England, Winter/Spring 2009 A 2019 essay by Anthony Flint argued that City Hall is \\"an elegant, successful work of architecture.\\" In 2019, a commemorative pin was produced in honor of the building's 50th anniversary. In an essay written during the anniversary year, architect Aaron Betsky wrote that City Hall \\"is one of the last concrete examples of government willing to fight for what it thinks is right, which is, or should be, or common good.\\" = Negative = In the 1960s, Mayor John F. Collins reportedly gasped as the design was first unveiled, and someone in the room blurted out, \\"What the hell is that?\\" City Hall is very unpopular with some Bostonians, as it is with some employees of the building. In 2006 some described it as a dark and unfriendly eyesore. In part, such opinions are a reaction against greater Boston's numerous examples of concrete modernism from the 1960s. As City Hall is one of the few public buildings in the Brutalist style, it receives more attention. Secondly, those opinions are influenced by the city's inadequate funding for maintenance (compared to the Boston Public Library, for instance), its need for upgraded lighting and mechanical systems, and its lack of coherent signage. The post-9/11 environment has dramatically changed what had been intended as a civil center and community space on the stairways and plaza around the building. Public access has been sharply reduced by the erection of security barriers and closing of numerous entrances. These changes have created a defensive effect and made the building isolated in its large space and more difficult for the public to use. In addition, the building's popularity declined as the tide turned away from modernism in New England to more traditional and post-modern styles in the 1970s and 1980s. The building was no longer new, architectural monumentality fell out of favor, and the idea of a \\"new\\" era and a \\"new\\" Boston became old-fashioned. The changes in style coincided with political changes, as Kevin White's mayoral administration ended. Under subsequent administrations, which focused on neighborhoods rather than the center city, and decentralization instead of centralized civic power, funding was funneled away from City Hall. Compared to the well-maintained Boston Public Library, a place characterized by brightness, cleanliness, and warmth, City Hall's spaces are dispiriting. In that context, some users and occupants have found City Hall to be unpleasant and dysfunctional. It has been the butt of jokes in some local magazines.Weekly Dig , May 2008 The structure's complex interior spaces and sometimes-confusing floor plan have not been mitigated by quality wayfinding, signage, graphics or lighting. Also, City Hall's large open spaces, central courtyard, and concrete structure make the building expensive to heat in an age of rising energy costs. But numerous public, institutional, and religious buildings throughout greater Boston feature similarly large, or larger, open spaces. As with other structures of its era, City Hall would benefit from a study of ways to \\"green\\" the building and reduce its energy requirements, while taking care to retain its dramatic design and key characteristics. A commentator wrote in 2006 that \\"I believe it's only a matter of time, and it will have to be totally removed, not modified, not retrofitted, not adapted.\\" In 2008, the building was voted \\"World's Ugliest Building\\" in an online poll by the travel agency Virtualtourist. A number of news outlets picked up that moniker, and Mayor Tom Menino adopted it during his long tenure as a boon to tourism.Boston City Hall tops ugliest-building list. The Boston Globereuters.com Travel Picks: 10 top ugly buildings and monuments A 2013 OPED essay by columnist Paul McMorrow in the Boston Globe described it as \\"the worst building in the city\\" and advocated demolition. Curbed Boston included City Hall on its 2018 list of Boston's \\"10 ugliest buildings.\\" A 2016 Boston Globe essay about \\"Boston flops, flubs, and failures\\" said City Hall was \\"cracking internally like a dead molar waiting to be pulled. Boston City Hall interior, 1981  Plaza  The surrounding City Hall Plaza has experienced a similar change in assessment over time. Although its recessed fountain, trees, and umbrella-shaded tables drew crowds in its early years, the space has more recently been cited as problematic in terms of design and urban planning. To illustrate the range of opinion regarding the Plaza, in 2004 the Project for Public Spaces identified it as the worst single public plaza worldwide out of hundreds of contenders, and it has placed the plaza on its \\"Hall of Shame.\\" On the other hand, in 2009, The Cultural Landscape Foundation included City Hall Plaza as one of 13 national \\"Marvels of Modernism\\" in its exhibition and publication. Several rounds of efforts to liven up City Hall Plaza have yielded only minimal changes, with the challenge being, in part, the numerous approvals required at the city, state, and federal levels.  Proposed modifications, relocation and demolition  Government Center station entrance in July 2020. In 2001, some City Hall workers complained that they were suffering from sick building syndrome. However, consultants hired by the city \\"did not identify any building-wide or acute air-quality issues.\\" Since 2006, a number of proposals have been made to modify City Hall or to demolish it and replace it with a new building on another site. On December 12, 2006, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino proposed selling the current city hall and adjacent plaza to private developers and moving the city government to a site in South Boston. On April 24, 2007, the Boston Landmarks Commission reviewed a petition, supported by a group of architects and preservationists. On July 10, 2008, a Landmarks Commission official said that the petition to designate the building as a local landmark had been accepted for study, giving the building pending landmark status. Members of the group Citizens for City Hall also opposed Mayor Menino's plan to build a new City Hall on the South Boston waterfront because it would be a major inconvenience for tens of thousands of city residents. In December 2008, Menino suspended his plan to move City Hall. In a worsening recession, he stated, \\"I can't consciously move ahead on a major project like this at this time.\\" An advocacy group, Friends of Boston City Hall, was established to help develop support for preserving and enhancing City Hall and improving the Plaza. In 2010, the Boston Society of Architects held a competition for ideas for modifying City Hall. In March 2011, plans were announced to rethink the building and its surrounding plaza.Casey Ross.

Boston Globe, March 16, 2011 In 2013, California Home + Design placed Boston City Hall on its list of \\"25 Buildings to Demolish Right Now.\\" While a candidate for Mayor of Boston, Martin J. Walsh called for the sale of City Hall for mixed-use redevelopment . But after his election, Walsh did not pursue such a sale. In 2015, the City of Boston launched a \\"Rethink City Hall\\" program to gather ideas for changes to the building and to City Hall Plaza. The Getty Foundation awarded Boston a grant of $120,000 in 2017 to study ways to preserve and enhance City Hall and its plaza. The Foundation noted ‚Äúa shift in public sentiment‚Äù in recent years, ‚Äúwith many residents now embracing the site as a key feature of the city fabric.‚Äù Suffolk University professor Harry Bartnick proposed that the building should be enclosed in a glass sheath to give it a more modern appearance and improve its energy efficiency. In August 2015, a developer's donations for a kitchen renovation was criticized by a fiscal watchdog. In January 2016, Mayor Walsh announced plans to install new LED lighting on the exterior of the building. \\"We are committed to creating a welcoming, lively City Hall Plaza,\\" Walsh said. The lights were turned on in October 2016. A more extensive set of renovations, designed by the Boston firm Utile, was completed in 2018. The renovations included new security and seating areas in the lobby, a coffee kiosk, new lighting, and new signage. Nearby events City Hall is located in Government Center, in Downtown Boston. The adjoining City Hall Plaza is sometimes used for parades and rallies and, most memorably, the region's championship sports teams, the Boston Celtics, Boston Bruins, New England Patriots, and the Boston Red Sox, have been feted in front of City Hall. A huge crowd in the plaza also greeted Queen Elizabeth II during her 1976 Bicentennial visit, as she walked from the Old State House to City Hall to have lunch with the Mayor. From 2013 to 2016, City Hall Plaza was home to the Boston Calling Music Festival. Since November 2016, the plaza has been home to Boston Winter, a holiday-themed shopping center, complete with a skating rink and other holiday events, held annually from November to January.

Contents Like GURPS Alternate Earths, Alternate Earths II presents a half- dozen parallel Earths with alternate histories, though one of these parallels is the world of Centrum which had previously appeared only as the mysterious and little-detailed home parallel of the antagonists from the GURPS Time Travel supplement to which both Alternate Earths titles are supplementary. The conflict between the Infinity Patrol and Centrum across the multiplicity of parallel Earths was made central to the Fourth Edition of GURPS as the default setting in the Basic Set and in the supplement GURPS Infinite Worlds. =Cornwallis= Cornwallis takes as its point of divergence from our history the decision of Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot to not criticise the extravagances of Marie Antoinette as he did in the real world. Without the queen's enmity, King Louis XVI heeded his advice against interference in the American Revolution over that of the anti-British Charles Gravier, and also implemented Turgot's Six Reforms, which prevented the French Revolution in this timeline. Without French support the American colonies' cause failed and the Tories in Britain acquiesced to a Second Restoration of true royal power. Monarchism became the order of the day in Europe, which eventually came under the sway of Czar Alexander II's Russian Empire. By the mid-1960s Russia found itself facing a Quintuple Alliance comprising the United Kingdom, Prussia, Austria, France, and Spain; the Great War ended in 1976 by the flight of the Romanovs and the establishment of the Russian Republic (which eventually became the Russian Dominate under General and self-declared First Citizen Boris Gromov). The \\"current year\\" in Cornwallis is 1984, and the world is carved into colonial slices by Russia (which holds Korea, Japan and Alaska) and the Five Thrones. Mercantilist economic theory holds sway, resulting in a restrictive network of tariffs, rail gauge changes and state monopolies throughout the globe (although the theories of Friedrich Hayek are having a stimulating effect in his native Austria). The American colonies are pinned between the Atlantic and treaty boundaries set by Britain to protect the Native American peoples of the interior. Oregon Country has been used for decades a dumping ground for undesirables of all sorts (including Jeremy Bentham, Eric Blair and survivors of the \\"Lincoln-Lee\\" rebellion of 1861). Russia has been generally ignored by the Five Thrones after its defeat, but First Citizen Gromov has rebuilt its industry and plots to export revolution throughout the world. =Ming-3= Ming-3 is a parallel universe almost entirely dominated by a Chinese empire whose fleets of exploration under Zheng He (Jeng Ho in the text) were never scrapped as they were in our history; the scenario credits the mother of the Xuande Emperor with having persuaded her son to put a final end to his voyages (her husband, the Hongxi Emperor, having opposed them during his short reign), and posits a plague that ended her life and her influence over Xuande. The plague also forces the imperial household to remain in the southern port city of Nanjing instead of moving to Beijing; accordingly, Zheng He's fleets were sustained, reached every corner of the Indian Ocean and rounded the Cape of Good Hope. Amphibious delivery of soldiers and supplies was developed out of necessity during a war with Annan province (Vietnam), which stood China in good stead when it found the need to pacify the lands in its naval trading sphere: Indonesia, the Malay Peninsula, southern India, various Arabian ports, and the eastern coast of Africa from Mogadishu to Mozambique. When Portuguese vessels entered the Indian Ocean and seized the port of Goa in defiance of Chinese authority, a fleet was sent to round the Cape of Good Hope, captured European ports on the west coast, and landed at Lisbon in 1519. War with Portugal led to war with Spain under King Charles I which ended in victory for the Chinese and the seizure of Spain's Mexican possessions and their gold. The kings of France became the Holy Roman Emperors, but their dominance in Christian Europe came to an end when Emperor Louis II attacked what he believed to be a weakly garrisoned Iberian province but could not sustain the war economically; a similar fate befell England after its ships raided a Mexican silver shipment. The \\"current year\\" is 1859; Nanjing is the effective capital of the world, the vassal realm of Datsin controls Europe from Poland to the Pyrenees, southern Africa is a de facto independent nation and a cosmopolitan outpost of Chinese culture on the edge of relatively unexplored central Africa, and the Americas are increasingly being populated with Asian rather than native subjects of the Empire. Unfortunately, imperial control is beginning to break down and many fear the Emperor has lost the Mandate of Heaven. =Midgard= Midgard diverges from real history in 860, when the Viking captains Hoskuld and Tyri set out to sack Mikligardr (Constantinople) while emperor Michael III \\"the Drunkard\\" was campaigning against the Saracens. In our history their fleet turned back; in Midgard they captured the city and were given the secret of Greek fire by religious dissidents, enabling them to destroy the Byzantine fleet on its return. With the riches of the city, a garrison left to hold it, and Greek fire, the Vikings' future raids against southern Europe were vastly more successful. Combined with the effects of the invasions of Europe by the Bulgars and Magyars, Christian Europe had no hope of survival. The \\"current year\\" is 1412; the pre-eminent Norse powers are Danemark (Denmark), Svearika (Sweden), Gardarika (a Varangian-founded territory stretching across northern Eurasia), and Vinland in North America. Christianity still exists, but it must compete with Norse paganism and \\"Thorism\\", a syncretic religion where Thor fights on man's behalf in Heaven in return for fealty in the afterlife. Other political entities of note include the Ming Empire, the Yanomami Caliphate and the Kingdom of Sikel. =Caliph= Caliph is perhaps the strangest of the Alternate Earths settings. The \\"current year\\" is only 1683 but the world is technologically far in advance of our present day. The point of divergence which made this possible is the invention of the printing press in the Abbasid Caliphate during the 9th century, which enabled the emergence of an Islamic Renaissance and consequent technological development about seven centuries ahead of real history. Calculus was devised in the early 11th century, oil- powered steamships were first built in the mid-13th century, and man first walked on the moon in 1434. The globe is divided between Dar al-Islam, the House of Islam (which comprises the four Muslim caliphates, the allied Christian Firanj (France and Germany) and China) and Dar al-Harb, the House of War, or those lands not governed by the dictates of the Ulama and the Islamic Shari'a law they define and apply to the Dar al-Islam. The secular Jamahariya Alliance (based in the New World) controls a third of the globe along with its ally, the totalitarian Caliphate of Hind (India); they are currently pushing for further conquest in an ultra-tech world that has not seen global war in centuries. Humanity has also spread to the rest of the solar system and to colony worlds in four other star systems accessible through FTL stargates. All humans living \\"beyond planetary atmospheres\\" are claimed as subjects of the corporation-dominated Rightly Guided Stellar Caliphate (which did so ostensibly to preserve humanity in case the fighting on Earth became genocidal in nature). Along with the reality of extraterrestrial life, the Stellar Caliphs also recently developed mainframe artificial intelligence agents called djinn, who are accepted as equals in Muslim society. =Aeolus= Aeolus breaks with our history in 1688, when the favourable winds which allowed William of Orange to safely cross the English Channel and invade England in the real world never materialized and his fleet was lost in the attempt. King James II was therefore never driven from his throne, and subsequently executed the anti-Catholic parliamentarians who had invited William to take the throne for treason. After this victory, James' Catholic sympathies were displayed openly as he ignored Parliament and allied with France. The eventual reunion of the Church of England with the Church of Rome in 1745 drove British Protestants to North America en masse; a series of succession crises and wars throughout the 19th century left 20th century Europe discontented and dissatisfied. Central Europe experienced a series of republican revolutions in the 1940s; the Republican Alliance that emerged is pinned between the Habsburg Dominions across northern Eurasia and the Bourbon Dominions of western Europe. In North America the Kingdom of Louisiane under the House of Orleans controls the most territory, though the Grand Duchy of Aleska and Mexique are also of considerable size. The American Commonwealth, a near-theocratic Protestant nation governed by a Lord Protector appointed for life, is smaller, of a size with Nouvelle France, the sole remaining colonial possession in North America. The character of Aeolus is of a world with near- modern technology (the \\"current year\\" is 1941) in which political thought is many years behind its course of development in our world. Fortunately for the Republican Alliance, the presence of Mikhail Gurevich and Henri Coanda has given them sole possession of jet aircraft technology and, indeed, the only airplanes on the planet. =Centrum= Centrum is detailed in Alternate Earths II in greater detail than before in the GURPS line. Its point of divergence is the successful crossing of the White Ship, meaning that William Adelin, the sole male heir of King Henry I of England, was never drowned. This not only prevented the succession struggle between his sister Matilda and Stephen of Blois (and the Anarchy which followed Stephen's accession to the throne), but also led to Eleanor of Aquitaine becoming even more important to Centrum's history than she was to ours. Married not to Henry II of England but to William Adelin's son Robert the Crusader, Eleanor ruled in her husband's absence and during their son's infancy, establishing an incredibly powerful Anglo-French Empire by her death in 1204. When Mongol invasions prevented expansion into central Europe, the Anglo-French explored the Atlantic Ocean and discovered the New World. Chinese technology imported by the Mongols and royal patronage of Roger Bacon's scientific inquiries meant that, although scientific progress in Centrum was slower than in our history, it maintained a head start of around a century. Eventually, the Anglo-French Empire dominated not only Europe but most of the globe. In 1902 the nuclear obliteration of London by parties unknown decapitated the AFE and kicked off a decade of civil war that killed more than half the world's population (mostly through unrestricted biowarfare). A military-industrial cabal based in Terraustralis (Australia), the Centrum, imposed draconian social controls in order to survive this Last War, and eventually ventured out with the aim of reconquering the globe and incorporating all humanity into a single, rational culture and social order. The development of \\"parachronics\\", the parallel- jumping technology central to the GURPS Time Travel setting, enabled Centran society to quickly recover from the war. The \\"current year\\" in Centrum is 2015, and much of Centrum's efforts focus on resisting the influences of \\"Secundus\\" (the \\"Homeline\\" parallel which the Infinity Patrol calls home) over the parallels Centrum itself can reach and manipulate. Publication history GURPS Alternate Earths II was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1999. Written by Kenneth Hite, Craig Neumeier and Michael S.

It had 9,822 inhabitants in 2010. Overview The town N√∂dinge-Nol was once three villages: Alafors, Nol and N√∂dinge. They have grown together into one locality. It is situated approximately northeast of Gothenburg next to the euro highway E45, east of the river G√∂ta √Ñlv. N√∂dinge community was originally called Kyrkby and has been the site of a church since medieval times. The current church was built in 1727 and has excellent murals. N√∂dinge-Nol as a common village has been defined by the Central Bureau of Statistics, based on their principles. The Land Survey Place Name Unit still lists N√∂dinge, Nol and Alafors as three individual places. The downtown area is dominated by apartment complexes and is surrounded by extensive countryside intermixed with villas. Downtown is Ale Torg, a shopping center with a diverse selection of stores. There is a junior high school, middle school, emergency room, library, a sports arena, a nine-hole golf course and a small boat harbor. The main public transport is Gothenburg commuter rail, which has two stations here, N√∂dinge and Nol and takes you to Gothenburg in about 15 minutes. The surrounding countryside includes very steep hills around the river G√∂ta √Ñlv. In the southeast is the nature reserve V√§ttlefj√§ll, which has numerous hiking trails and lakes in various sizes that are spread out over . The G√∂ta √Ñlv ridge to the east. Inside the town itself there are a large number of steep hills intermixed with flat valleys that today is fertile farmland, but which once was the sea bottom. The hills used to be islets of the old archipelago. Ale is known for many things, best found on Ale Municipality page. Alafors for its brewery Ahlafors Bryggerier, Nol for the former industrial factories. N√∂dinge in Ale was founded by a king called Inge. When fleeing from his enemies he swam with his horse over G√∂ta √Ñlv where he was helped. In gratitude, Inge founded Kirkby (kyrkby = church village) but when it started to form itself to a town it changed Its name to N√∂dinge. (Distress = N√∂d, Inge = Inge, that becomes N√∂dinge (Inge was in need of help). This is based on folk etymology and is not the real meaning of the name.

He also was a physician who studied for his medical degree during his eight-year playing career with the New York Yankees (1946‚Äì1952, 1954). Biography =Education= Born in Seattle, Washington, Brown attended Galileo High School in San Francisco, then Stanford University and UCLA, before receiving his medical degree from Tulane University. During his time at Stanford, he and another student were involved in the rescue of a Coast Guardsman from a plane crash, for which Brown received a Silver Lifesaving Medal. =Playing career= Sometimes known as \\"Golden Boy\\" during his baseball career, Brown played 548 regular-season games for the Yankees, with a lifetime batting average of .279 and 22 home runs. In addition, he appeared in four World Series (1947, 1949, 1950, 1951) for New York, batting .439 (18-for-41) in 17 games. Brown batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He missed seasons due to military service during the Korean War. Brown had a bases-loaded triple in Game 4 and a two-run triple in the championship- clinching Game 5 of the 1949 World Series. He tripled again in the final game of the 1950 World Series. A famous apocryphal story that has made the rounds for years in baseball circles concerns the time when Brown's road roommate was star Yankee catcher Yogi Berra, who had little formal education. The two were reading in their hotel room one night ‚Äì Berra a comic book and Brown his copy of Boyd's Pathology. Berra came to the end of his comic, tossed it aside, and asked Brown, \\"So, how is yours turning out?\\" Brown is the last living member of the Yankees team that won the 1947 World Series. There are no living players who played on an earlier World Series-winning team. =Baseball executive career= Brown practiced cardiology in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth area until May , when he took a leave of absence to serve as an interim president of the AL Texas Rangers ‚Äì then returned to medicine following the season. In , he succeeded Lee MacPhail as AL president and held the post for a decade; Gene Budig replaced him. In 1992 and 1993, Brown presented the World Series Trophy (on both occasions to the Toronto Blue Jays) instead of the Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig. The presidencies of both the American League and the National League were eliminated in , and their duties were absorbed by the office of the Commissioner. Legacy A decorated veteran of two wars, a noted baseball player who served on five championship teams, an accomplished physician, and the former president of the American League, Brown is considered to have few equals in the history of major league baseball. He is a regular at the Yankees' annual Old-Timers' Day celebrations. On March 26, 1957, Brown was a contestant on the game show To Tell The Truth. (Repeats of the episode are occasionally broadcast on the Game Show Network and can also be seen on YouTube.) Brown's wife of more than 60 years, Sara, died on March 26, 2012. They were married in October 1951, shortly after the 1951 World Series.

He first became widely known for his discovery of the T-cell receptor in 1983 and pioneering work in the genetics of immunology. In 1995, Mak published a landmark paper on the discovery of the function of the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4, thus opening the path for immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitors as a means of cancer treatment. Mak is also the founder of Agios Pharmaceuticals, whose lead compound, IDHIFA¬Æ, was approved by the FDA for acute myeloid leukemia in August 2017, becoming the first drug specifically targeting cancer metabolism to be used for cancer treatment. He has worked in a variety of areas including biochemistry, immunology, and cancer genetics. Early life Born in southern China in 1946 to parents who were silk merchants, and raised in Hong Kong, parents encouraged him to become a doctor, his interests lay elsewhere - in math, biology, and chemistry. Mak and his family moved to the United States of America during the mid-1960s and with the choice of going to the University of California or Wisconsin, he was persuaded by his mother to attend Wisconsin to avoid the antiwar activities at California. His interest in life and chemistry led him to eventually studying biochemistry and biophysics at the University of Wisconsin. University Life At the University of Wisconsin, Mak met virologist Roland Rueckert. Mak initially went to his lab to inquire about a job posting from Rueckert's lab looking for someone to wash test tubes. After his first day on the job, Mak asked if more cleaning work was available, in which Rueckert said there was not, however there was experimental research work available. That, as Mak would later state, would be the beginning of his scientific career. After finishing his degree at Wisconsin, Mak moved to Canada to begin his doctoral studies at the University of Alberta, Edmonton. In the early 1970s, he earned his PhD in biochemistry from the University of Alberta. After he obtained his degree, Mak moved to Toronto and became a Canadian citizen. In Toronto, he worked with Ernest McCulloch and James Till, who discovered haematopoietic stem cells. Scientific career In 1980, Mak returned to Wisconsin to learn new techniques in the lab of Howard Martin Temin, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 for his discovery of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Temin would be one of his mentors that shaped his way of thinking, encouraging him to delve into diverse disciplines. During the early 1980s in Toronto, with his newly setup group, Mak was working on virology. Mak employed a technique called molecular subtraction, used by virologists, to attempt to identify the T-cell receptor, which was so elusive at the time it was referred to as the \\"Holy Grail of Immunology\\". In 1984, Mak discovered the T-cell receptor, with Mark M. Davis identifying the receptor in mouse. This work on the cloning of T-cell receptor genes, , has been cited nearly 1200 times. In spite of offers from prestigious institutions around the world, Mak remained committed to Canada‚Äôs scientific community. In 1993, Mak received support from the world's largest independent biotech company, Amgen, to establish the Amgen Research Institute in Toronto. Financial support from Amgen resulted in his lab pioneering the use of knockout mice, and as a result his lab generated one of the first knockout mice and has generated more knockout mice than any other lab in the world. Mak‚Äôs role in advancing the use of genetically-altered mice in scientific study has led to important breakthroughs in immunology and understanding cancer at the cellular level. As of 2005, Amgen-produced papers have been cited more than 40,000 times. The basic research in cancer conducted by Mak has been published in top international scientific journals and he has given several keynote addresses at cancer symposia across Canada and the United States. By 1995, Mak had reached a high point in his career, when he and his team published their seminal findings on the function of CTLA-4, thus paving the road for Immunotherapy and Checkpoint inhibition as potential anti-cancer therapies. In 2004 Mak became the director of the Advanced Medical Discovery Institute and the Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research. He is also the senior scientist, division of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Advanced Medical Discovery Institute/Ontario Cancer Institute. He is a member of the Cancer Research Institute Scientific Advisory Council.Cancer Research Institute Scientific Advisory Council List Since 1984, he has been a Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Immunology at the University of Toronto. From the early 2000s, Mak concentrated his efforts on the emerging field of cancer metabolism. Mak, Lewis C. Cantley, and Craig B. Thompson together founded Agios Pharmaceuticals, a biotech pharmaceutical company whose sole purpose is to discover methods of targeting cancer metabolism. The trio have contributed immensely in a few years to what was originally a forgotten paradigm. The discovery of the involvement of particular enzymes such as PKM2, mutated IDH as well as novel oncometabolites such as 2-hydroxyglutarate in cancer development have once again brought cancer metabolism back to the forefront of cancer biology. On August 1, Agios announced that the FDA had approved their lead compound, IDHIFA¬Æ, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. IDHIFA¬Æ targets a mutant form of Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 and is the first drug specifically targeting cancer metabolism to be used for cancer treatment. Mak holds Honorary Doctoral Degrees from numerous universities in North America and Europe. He is an Officer of the Order of Canada and has been elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) as well as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (UK.) He has won international recognition in the forms of the Emil von Behring Prize, the King Faisal Prize for Medicine, the Gairdner Foundation International Award, the Sloan Prize of the General Motors Cancer Foundation, the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize and the Novartis Prize in Immunology.

This instigated widespread protest from the Taiwanese art community as comparable works by western artists were held by Japanese and Taiwanese museums. =KMT period= In 1941, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and before the KMT had retreated to Taiwan, the second volume of the book \\"Inside Asia\\", by John Gunther, was prohibited and censored by the Chinese government. In much of the martial law period in Taiwan (1948‚Äì1987), the Kuomintang-led ROC, as an authoritarian state, exercised strict control of the media. Parties other than the Kuomintang, such as the Chinese Youth Party and China Democratic Socialist Party, were banned and media advocating either democracy or Taiwan independence was banned. Li Ao, a famous political activist in Taiwan, nationalist, and intellectual, had over 96 books banned from sale. Writer Bo Yang was jailed for eight years for his translation of the cartoon Popeye because the translation was interpreted as a criticism of leader Chiang Kai- shek. Taiwanese-language media was also banned, and children who spoke Taiwanese in school were physically punished. The revision of Criminal Acts against seditious speech in 1992 ended the persecution of political opponents. Post-democratisation Censorship laws remain in place as applicable to the Taiwan Area, but are not enforced with the former rigour. The main areas of censorship, or alleged censorship, occur in the realms of politics, cross- Strait relations, and national security. The principal organs of censorship are the National Communications Commission (NCC) and the Government Information Office (GIO). The formerly murky lines of control exercised by the government over the media through party-ownership of media assets during the Kuomintang era have now been resolved by the progressive divestiture of such assets by the Kuomintang under sustained pressure from the Democratic Progressive Party. =Political censorship in Taiwan= Laws governing elections and politics restrict the publication and broadcasting of political material. For example, in the local elections of 2005, CDs with videos ridiculing candidates were confiscated in accordance to the Election and Recall Act. Laws prohibiting the promotion of Communism has already abolished in 2011.‰∏çÂæó‰∏ªÂºµÂÖ±Áî¢ÂàÜË£ÇÂúãÂúü Âà™Èô§ Ôºå‰∏≠Â§ÆÁ§æÔºå2011/05/16 For example, Taiwan Communist Party obtaining registration as a political party in 2008, and become the 141st registered party in Taiwan.Èô≥ÊÄùÁ©é Âè∞ÂåóÂ†±Â∞éÔºå„Äà‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂèØ‰∏ªÂºµÂÖ±Áî¢ÔºÅ ÂÖßÊîøÈÉ®Ôºö„ÄåÂè∞ÁÅ£ÂÖ±Áî¢Èª®„ÄçÁî≥Ë´ãÂÇôÊ°àÁç≤-{ÂáÜ}-„ÄâÔºå„ÄäNOWnews„Äã2008-08-12 More covert moves have also been made by the government to censor unfavorable media. In 2006, the government under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) refused to renew the broadcasting licenses of certain television channels suggesting that the broadcasters were not in compliance with broadcasting standards. However, this move became controversial because some of the channels who failed their broadcast license renewal have a reputation to favour the opposition Kuomintang in their programming. = Publication Censorship in Taiwan = During the martial law period the KMT, as an authoritarian state, exercised strict control of publication. Distribution of political manifestos and documents other than those from the KMT, Chinese Youth Party and China Democratic Socialist Party, were banned and publications advocating either democracy or Taiwan independence were banned. The KMT found that one of the causes leading to the failure of the fight against the communists was the policy regarding literary and artistic work. It was then decided to start book-ban to control the thinking of the people‚Äînot only were the books on communism banned but those which echoed similar ideas and whose authors stayed in communist region. Publications were strictly managed by the Taiwan Garrison Command and regulated by the Publication Control Act (Âá∫ÁâàÁâ©ÁÆ°Âà∂Ëæ¶Ê≥ï) during the martial law era. Books that bore the name of Karl Marx were suppressed, as well as works by other authors whose names began with an \\"M,\\" such as Max Weber and Mark Twain, because in Mandarin their first names sounded similar to Marx. While this has become a joke today, it was a real manifestation of the thought control at the time. Universities became a hotbed for communist study groups and the KMT recognized that university campuses were places of open ideas and thought and would hire student informants in classes to inform the Garrison Command of any students discussing issues that may be seen as a threat to the KMT. Some illegal communist publications remained in the archives and back shelves of some University libraries and the books would bear a stamp declaring the book and its content as an order of arrest. The publishing ban also affected teaching materials for modern Chinese literature and foreign literature. Renowned Chinese writers, such as Lu Xun, Ba Jin and Lao She were banned, and the law extended to foreign literature they translated, such as those by Ivan Turgenev, Emily Bront√´ or √âmile Zola. Li Ao, a famous political activist in Taiwan, nationalist, and intellectual, had over 96 books banned from sale. Writer Bo Yang was jailed for eight years for his translation of the cartoon Popeye because the translation was interpreted as a criticism of leader Chiang Kai-shek and in June 1952 the student of national Taiwan University of archeology Ch'iu Yen-Liang was arrested by the Garrison command of KMT and sentenced to six years imprisonment for alleged membership of a marxist study group. \\"Only those who lived through the martial law era know how important freedom and democracy are,\\" said , a professor of history at Shih Hsin University. Lee knew first-hand what life was like during the martial law era. One of Lee's books, The Confession of a Defector (ÂèõÂæíÁöÑÂëäÁôΩ), was banned by the authorities on the grounds that it \\"sabotaged the credibility of the government,\\" \\"instigated dissension between the government and the people,\\" \\"violated the basic national policy,\\" \\"confused public opinion\\" and \\"damaged popular sentiments.\\" Lee said he felt that the ban was \\"ridiculous\\" because the book was a collection of articles he had already published in newspapers. The books were recalled a few months after hitting the shelves. A magazine he co-founded in 1979, called the 80s, encountered a similar fate. The magazines were confiscated and he was ordered to stop publication for a year. To keep the magazine going, Lee and his cohorts obtained another license for a magazine which went under a different name, the Asian.When the Asian was also ordered to cease publication, they acquired another license for the magazine, this time under the name Current. All publications had to obtain government licenses, and from 1951 to 1988, the authorities limited the number of licenses available for publishing daily newspapers to 31, with the number of pages in each paper also subject to a legal limit (first eight and then 12 pages). This was supposedly due to a \\"paper shortage.\\" During this period, many of the newspapers were directly owned by the government, the military, or the KMT. Private newspaper publisher were usually KMT members. The only paper to feature occasional moderate criticisms of the government (along with some of the best news reporting) was the Independence Evening Post. The publication was the first to send journalists to China four months after the lifting of martial law, despite government opposition. The authorities continually refused to allow it to publish for the more lucrative morning market until 1988. Since the lifting of martial law, censorship has declined but has not vanished. Lively new magazines have appeared on the scene, notably The Journalist, which has featured in-depth coverage of politics and social issues combined with editorial criticism of both the government and the opposition. The authorities continue to suppress printed discussion of Taiwan independence, military corruption, and the involvement of the military in politics, and to subject people who write about these topics to prison terms. In January 1988, a year after the lifting of martial law the authority lifted the ban on new newspapers and increased the page limit to 32. Since then, the government has issued over 200 licenses, and 50 papers are actually publishing. Like the magazines, papers have become much bolder in their willingness to publish investigative and analytical articles, as well as editorials criticizing government policy. Some independent newspapers including The Common Daily, The Independent Post, and The Liberty Times have become more critical in their editorial stance. However, the staunchly pro-KMT China Times and United Daily continue to dominate the market, with the other papers competing to serve as reader‚Äôs second newspaper. Total circulation of all dailies is nearly six million copies. The authorities have also liberalized their past ban on reprinting materials from the mainland, and their suppression of publication styles used there. In 2007 during the 20th anniversary of the end of Taiwan's martial law, local newspapers allotted substantial space to coverage of culture and society in the martial-law era, paying particular attention to the ban on books, popular songs and the publication of newspapers. Books suppressed from the 1950s to 1980s and several banned songs were part of an exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Education and the National Central Library as one of the events commemorating the martial-law era, which officially ended 15 July 1987. Visitors to the opening included President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, whose books had been on the banned list during the 1970s and 1980s, the Chinese- language Liberty Times reported July 15. Around 180 books, 32 magazines and collections of news footage were displayed at the exhibition. The first item shown to the public was a bibliography compiled by the TGC, which contained more than 2,400 titles. Banned books invariably sold well underground, however. One example was \\"A Taste of Freedom,\\" the memoir by Peng Ming-min, a prominent dissident. Peng's book sold so many copies it could have helped fund the election campaigns of candidates who opposed the KMT at the time, wrote Tsai Sheng-chi, a researcher at the Academia Historica, in the exhibition brochure. = Music and performance censorship in Taiwan = Many songs, both Chinese and Taiwanese, were banned during the martial law era. Teresa Teng's popular Chinese song \\"When Will You Return?\\" (‰ΩïÊó•ÂêõÂÜç‰æÜ) was banned because the authorities considered the Chinese word \\"you\\" (Âêõ) -- pronounced jun in Mandarin‚Äîwas a reference to the Communists liberation \\"army\\" (Ëªç), which has the same pronunciation. Yao Su-ron's (ÂßöËòáËìâ) The Breaker of a Pure Heart (Ë≤†ÂøÉÁöÑ‰∫∫) was not only banned, Yao was arrested on stage before she could start to sing it. Dubbed the \\"queen of banned songs,\\" Yao had about 80 or 90 songs banned. Wen Shia (ÊñáÂ§è) was touted the \\"king of banned songs.\\" Nearly 100 of his songs were banned. Taiwanese songs with titles such as Mending the Net (Ë£úÁ†¥Á∂≤), Sentimental Memories (ËàäÊÉÖÁ∂øÁ∂ø) and Mama, I Am Brave (Â™ΩÂ™ΩÊàë‰πüÁúüÂãáÂÅ•) were thought to \\"corrode military morale,\\" \\"reflect the plight of the people\\" and \\"create nostalgia for life in mainland China.\\" Official statistics show that more than 930 songs were banned from 1979 to 1987. Among the 10 reasons given by the authorities for banning songs were that they promoted left-wing ideology, reflected Communist propaganda, corroded popular sentiments and endangered the physical and mental health of youth. The censorship on music also included a ban on all public performance and dance under the freedom of assembly Act, another justification for this was that the message of live music could not be regulated. During the early 80s the first progressive rock band formed called the Typhoons (originally called Vespers) the band members were western expats who were studying mandarin at the time and would regularly hold illegal performances in and around Taipei. The performances would be self advertised with homemade posters and during the performances friends would stand outside checking for the Garrison Command, if they were seen the band would be signaled and the performance would stop momentarily and anyone dancing would immediately sit down. =Cross Strait relations= The use of overt and covert censorship in relation to mainland China and the People's Republic of China is an active area of controversy. For example, satellite channels perceived to adopt a pro-PRC or pro-unification editorial stance, such as Phoenix TV, were refused landing rights in Taiwan by the DPP-controlled government. Similarly, correspondent offices representing the PRC government-controlled Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily were closed by the DPP-controlled government. These policies were reversed after the election of the Kuomintang in 2008. =Internet censorship in Taiwan= According to a survey conducted by Taiwan‚Äôs Institute for Information Industry, an NGO, 81.8% of households had access to the Internet at the end of 2011. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the authorities generally respect these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to protect freedom of speech and press. There are no official restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the authorities monitor e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight.\\"Taiwan\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013. Retrieved 27 December 2013. The websites of mainland institutions such as the Communist Party of China, People's Daily and China Central Television can be freely accessed from Taiwan. =Future of censorship in Taiwan= The authority for censorship in Taiwan since 2006 is the National Communications Commission (NCC).\\"National Communications Commission Organization Act\\", Presidential Announcement, Gazette of the Office of the President No. 6658, November 9, 2005.

She was funded by a don des vaisseaux grant by the Estates of Brittany. She was active in the European theatres of the Anglo- French War and of the French Revolutionary Wars, notably taking an important role in the Glorious First of June. Later, she took part in the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver and was broken up.  Context  The Seven Years' War had left the French Navy severely depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 √âtienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named don des vaisseaux. On 1 September 1762, the Estates of Brittany gathered at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Rennes and decided to raise one million Livres tournois in order to offer a 100-gun Three-decker. Lieutenant Jean-Claude Louis de Quelen rode to Choisy- le-Roi to inform Louis XV, arriving on 5 and returning on 9 with acceptance letters from the King and from the Duke de Choiseul. Administrative dispositions for the loan started on 2 November, and were completed by 17. Budget would eventually reach 1,010,000 Livres tournois. The donation had political connotations, both in terms of rivalry between the various donating institutions, and for the status of Bretagne within France.Forrer, p. 13 Therefore, the Estates of Brittany attached their gift to a number of requests: that the ship be named Bretagne rather than √âtats de Bretagne, that the crew be composed of Bretons exlusively, and that the ship be a three- decker. Furthermore, rather than donate funds that the Crown would invest in construction, the Estates demanded to supervise construction themselves at the shipyards of the French East India Company in Lorient.  Construction  On 2 November 1761, the Commission of the Estates of Brittany in charge of construction mandated Antoine Groignard as chief engineer, with Gaubry as deputy and Damel as an advisor. Groignard worked both for the French Royal Navy and for the French East India Company; he had recently directed the construction of the 80-gun Orient, the 74-gun Robuste, the 64-gun Vengeur and Solitaire, and was supervising ongoing construction of the 74-gun Diligent and Six Corps, the 56-gun Bordelois in Lorient, that of the 56-gun Utile, Ferme and Flamand in Bordeaux, and four frigates in Nantes. On 17 November 1761, Groignard sent of proposal for a budget between 919,000 and 1,115,000 pounds. The shipyards in Lorient received their first orders in early December. Choiseul wrote the Groignard to congratulate him for his appointment, and to argue in favour of building an 80-gun two-decker, with 36-pounders on the lower battery and 24-pounders on the upper, although he conceded that political considerations mandated a three-decker. He also reminded of the shortcomings of Royal Louis, an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time. Groignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.14 and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two. By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765, and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship. Depiction on Bretagne flying the white ensign of the Ancien R√©gime. By 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of Bretagne. On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man≈ìuverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions. On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost. On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin. The Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient, who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum. Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands. Providers would span from Newcastle to Saint Petersburg and Riga. In August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work. In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months. On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the frames were made and ready to be installed. However, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, and summoned Groignard to Nantes. Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest. By March, Brest had won the contract;the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765. Groignard remained in charge of the work, while the Commission was little involved from then on. On 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.15 By mid-July, the framing was completed. By mid-September, the hull was caulked. In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the orlop deck and were preparing construction of the first battery. In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed. On 24 May 1766, Bretagne was launched. Completion of the ship remained slow: although Bretagne was declared completed on 30 September 1767 and officially commissioned in 1768, work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out. On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.  Career  In 1773, Bretagne was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy. However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August. In 1775, Orvilliers took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned Sartine for an extensive refit; reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking 480,000 pounds, and Bretagne was launched on 7 April 1777. She took two more months for fitting out. = Anglo-French War (1778‚Äì1783)= Battle of Ushant depicting Bretagne fighting HMS Victory. Representation of Bretagne circa 1782, Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts. She took part in most of the engagements of the European theatre of the Anglo-French War, notably the Battle of Ushant in 1778, where she served as Orvilliers' flagship, with Parscau du Plessix as flag captain. She took part in the Armada of 1779, but an epidemic aboard forced her to return to Brest in September. In 1779, her armament was reinforced by adding 10 further 6-pounders to her quarterdeck, turning her into a 110-gun. On 2 September 1780, Bretagne left Brest for Cadiz, where she took part in the Great Siege of Gibraltar. Although she had good nautical qualities, Bretagne had a tendency to leak and hog,Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.20 and from February to April 1781, she underwent a refit in Brest and notably received a copper sheathing. Bretagne then undertook an expedition under Captain Soulange in Guichen's squadron in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic from 22 June to early September.Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.19 After spending three months in Brest, she sailed again on 12 December 1781. She sustained damage in foul weather, notably in a hurricane on 25 and 26 December. At her return to Brest, Bretagne was in need of serious repairs, and Guichen, to his chagrin, had to transfer his flag to Terrible. In 1782, her keel had hogged by 1'7\\" pied du roi. Bretagne was refitted in Brest from 2 March to July 1782, undergoing extensive repairs of her hull but losing her copper sheathing in the process. On 8 July 1782, Bretagne departed Brest under Captain Charles Picot de Dampierre to join the franco-Spanish combined fleet still besieging Gibraltar, arriving on 11 along with Invincible, Robuste, Protecteur, Actif, Zodiaque, Bien Aim√© and Guerrier.Troude, vol.2, p.128 Her cutter rescued men from the crew of the Spanish floating battery Talla Piedra on 13 September. Bretagne, under Dampierre,Kerguelen-Tr√©marec, p.323Troude, vol.2, p.134 blockaded Gibraltar until 10 October, when a gale damaged her rigging, killing a helmsman and ripping anchors from the ship. On 13 October 1782, the fleet moved to intercept a British squadron, resulting in the Battle of Cape Spartel on 20 where Bretagne sustained 5 men wounded. Bretagne then returned to Cadiz harbour in preparation for an expedition to America under Admiral d'Estaing, but by then the Peace of Paris had been concluded and Bretagne returned to Brest. Bretagne was refitted in Brest in 1788 until the end of the year. The poop deck was removed to improve stability. = French Revolutionary Wars = Bretagne was refitted in Brest from 1792 to June 1793, 6 obusiers de vaisseau being added that year. Under Captain Joseph de Richery, she became the flagship of Admiral Jean-Amable Lelarge.Troude, vol.2, p.287Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.21 In September 1793, her crew was involved in the Quib√©ron mutinies; in reaction Jeanbon Saint-Andr√© had Lelarge destitued and Richery arrested,Troude, vol.2, p.290 and Bretagne renamed to R√©volutionnaire. Captain Daniel VandongenJohnson, p. 96 took command of R√©volutionnaire and put her in good order. By 19 June 1794, she was copperd and fully armed. On 16 May 1794, the fleet departed Brest.Troude, vol.2, p.328 On 28, the British and French squadrons met, leading to the skirmishes that would culminate into the so- called Glorious First of June. The French line of battle was set in reverse order, and R√©volutionnaire found herself at the rear, last ship in the line. She came in action against five or six 74-gun ships, notably HMS Russell, Bellerophon, Audacious and Leviathan, sustaining heavy damage and casualties. At 0930, a shot killed Captain Vandongen; as the first lieutenant was severely wounded and the second lieutenant has already been killed,Johnson, p.87 third Lieutenant Renaudeau assumed command, but he too was incapacitated almost immediately, and Fourth Lieutenant Dorr√© had to take over.Troude, vol.2, p.334 R√©volutionnaire was isolated and defenceless, and avoided captured mostly thanks to Admiral Howe's order to his ships to regroup. In the night, R√©volutionnaire lost her mizen and her mainmast. The next day, she met Audacieux and Unit√©, of Nielly's squadron; Audacieux took R√©volutionnaire in tow and brought her to √éle-d'Aix, where she arrived on 8 June with 160 crewmembers killed or wounded. R√©volutionnaire was fully repaired and rigged anew at √éle-d'Aix, which entailed the construction of a workshop specially for that purpose, as well as bringing all parts from Rochefort. She was ready again on 7 August 1794, and rejoined Brest on 27 of the same month. On 29 December 1794, under Captain Louis-Marie Le Gouardun, R√©volutionnaire departed from Brest for the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver, where she sustained severe structural damage from the foul weather. She limped back to Brest on 2 February 1795, her hull leaking heavily. Too damaged in the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver to be repaired, she was struck on 28 January 1796 and broken up between January and May 1796.  Legacy  A scale model of the Bretagne is on display at Brest naval museum (MnM 13 MG 4). Admiral Fran√ßois-Edmond P√¢ris states that it was built by of under supervision from Forfait around 1780. The model depicts Bretagne in her 1777 state (no coppering yet, but already 16 guns on the castles, 10 on the quarterdeck and 6 on the forecastle).Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.17 The ornaments are not quite realistic: the aft is overly decorated compared to the drawings to master sculptor Lubet, and the figurehead is a woman carrying the arms of Bretagne, reflecting a project that was never realised in reality. The actual figurehead featured a lion carrying the arms of Bretagne. Bretagne is depicted on the painting Vue du port de Brest en 1793 by Jean-Fran√ßois Hue.Forrer, Neptunia 202, p. 18 Claude Forrer published a plan of Bretagne by master sculptor Lubet in Neptunia 202 in June 1996.
