He was an International Master who competed for his country on several occasions. His main career was as a university professor. Chess career Byrne won the U.S. Open Chess Championship in 1953 in Milwaukee and around that time he achieved the second- highest rating in the U.S., behind Samuel Reshevsky, against whom Byrne had a winning record. He was awarded the International Master title by FIDE (the World Chess Federation) in 1962, and played for or captained five U.S. Chess Olympiad teams between 1962 and 1972. In 1972, he led a team representing Pennsylvania State University (the remainder of the team was alumni) to the US Amateur Team Championship in Philadelphia. The winning Penn State team consisted of Byrne, Dan Heisman, Steve Wexler, Bill Bickham, and Jim Joachim (alt.). Byrne's elder brother, Grandmaster Robert Byrne, was also a leading player of that time. Byrne was a great ambassador for American chess, seemingly on good terms with players from both sides of the Iron Curtain. At the 1966 Chess Olympiad in Havana, Cuba, Fischer, a member of the Worldwide Church of God, would not compete on Saturdays, and the tournament officials knew this, yet they scheduled his first game against a Soviet player on Saturday, leading to accusations and hot tempers by the U.S. and Soviet teams and the tournament officials. Byrne's diplomacy and communication skills and the respect that all the players had for his integrity were enough to get the game rescheduled with everyone saving face. The tournament proceeded without further incident. Host Fidel Castro gave Byrne a beautifully hand-carved chess set to thank him. Byrne was repeatedly asked by his teammates to be team captain, because of his interpersonal acumen and his generous, helpful nature. He routinely helped all the players analyze their games during adjournments, and he repeatedly succeeded in getting the temperamental Bobby Fischer to \\"relax and play the game\\", as he would tell Fischer when stress threatened his continued participation in tournaments. The Game of the Century In the late 1950s Byrne contracted lupus, an auto-immune disease that led to the demise of his kidneys and made him allergic to the sun. He was known around campus for his very wide-brimmed brown Stetson hat. He would frequently tell stories about his chess exploits, often turning red from laughter. One story occurred in the 1956 Rosenwald tournament during the Game of the Century between Byrne and Bobby Fischer. Fischer was winning the game decisively, and Byrne asked some of the other players if it would be a good \\"tip of the hat\\" to Fischer's superb play to let young Fischer play the game to a checkmate instead of Byrne resigning, which would normally happen between masters. When the other players agreed, Byrne played the game out until Fischer checkmated him. Byrne added \\"You have to remember, Bobby wasn't yet Bobby Fischer at that time\\", meaning that the then 13-year-old Fischer was \\"only\\" a master, and not yet the 14-year-old wunderkind and top U.S. player he became the following year.

As a player Byrne popularized the ...a5 line in the Yugoslav Attack in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Against 1. d4 he often preferred to play the Gruenfeld Defense. As White he preferred using the English Opening. Other biography Born in New York City, Byrne was a professor of English. He taught at Pennsylvania State University from 1961 until his death, having been invited there to teach and to coach the varsity chess team. Before his time at Penn State, he was a professor at Valparaiso University in Indiana. He was a competitor in the chess club run by Brooklyn chess coach and master John W. Collins. Collins wrote about his students in the book My Seven Chess Prodigies, which features both Byrne brothers, Donald and Robert, and the young Bobby Fischer. Byrne died in Philadelphia of complications arising from lupus. He was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 2003.

King during the Solemn funeral of Albert VI of Austria Louis d'Ursel was the King of Arms of Flanders King of Arms is the senior rank of an officer of arms. In many heraldic traditions, only a king of arms has the authority to grant armorial bearings and sometimes certify genealogies and noble titles. In other traditions, the power has been delegated to other officers of similar rank. Heraldic duties Crown of an English King of Arms In England, the authority to grant a coat of arms is subject to the formal approval of the Earl Marshal in the form of a warrant. In jurisdictions such as the Republic of Ireland the authority to grant armorial bearings has been delegated to a chief herald that serves the same purpose as the traditional king of arms. Canada also has a chief herald, though this officer grants arms on the authority of the Governor General as the Queen's representative through the Herald Chancellor's direct remit. Scotland's only king of arms, the Lord Lyon, exercises the royal prerogative by direct delegation from the Crown and like the Chief Herald of Ireland and the old Ulster King of Arms needs no warrant from any other office bearer. In the Kingdom of Spain, the power to certify coats of arms has been given to the Cronistas de Armas (Chroniclers of Arms). The English and Scottish kings of arms are the only officers of arms to have a distinctive crown of office, used for ceremonial purposes such as at coronations (as opposed to peers, who instead wear a coronet). At the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the kings of arms used a crown trimmed with sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, and inscribed with the words Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam (Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; Psalm 51). When this crown is shown in pictorial representations, nine leaves and the first three words are shown. Recently, a new crown has been made for the Lord Lyon, modelled on the Scottish Royal crown among the Honours of Scotland. This crown has removable arches (like one of the late Queen Mother's crowns) which will be removed at coronations to avoid any hint of l√®se majest√©.

It has been part of the Danube-Auen National Park since 1996 and has been a protected area since 1978. It is used as a recreational area and is known as a site of nudism. There is also an oil harbour, and the Austrian Army used the Lobau as a training ground. In addition to the water coming from the Alps through the Wiener Hochquellenwasserleitung, the Lobau is a source of groundwater for Vienna. The Donauinsel (Vienna Danube Island) borders the Lobau. History The Lobau was the site of the Battle of Aspern-Essling in 1809, the first major defeat suffered by Napol√©on, which was inflicted on him by an Austrian army led by Archduke Charles, and of the Battle of Wagram, a victory for Napoleon that followed two months later. During the Oil Campaign of World War II, the Lobau oil refinery was bombed beginning on August 22, 1944.  Impact on the environment  Some small territories were used by the army for soldier training. The Lobau also has a big impact on tapwater in Vienna itself, since it is one of the sources to provide water to its population. The Lobau houses a huge amount of different species of the flora and fauna that are in danger of extinction. Since 1977 the Lobau with a property is considered as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. The Lobau is composed of nature zones, of which only 25% are being taken care of. Since 1978 the Lobau is at the same time an area under landscape protection, a preserved area and also a biosphere reserve. The area covers one fifth of the 22nd district in Vienna.  Flora and fauna  The Lobau consists in a flora and fauna of exception, but on its way to extinction due to environmental problems. This is why, to preserve it, the Lobau has become a protected area since 1996. Furthermore, starting October 26, 1996 the protected park has integrated the national park of Donau Auen, which is one of natural areas \\"nature 2000\\". The area has been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 1982.  Reed bed  The Josefsteg is a bridge found in the middle of the Lobau. 150 years ago there was a river bed, it was the Danube's bed. This passage constructed of wood, is about a , this bridge also represents the human impact on the protected area even though it is made of wood. As said before this park is known for its wide variety of flora and fauna and one typical example is the reed bed surrounding the Josefsteg covering a large part of the area. The common reed, (Phragmites australis), is a cosmopolite species of perennial plant that belongs to the Poaceae, which is a sub family of the Arundinoideae.

Her 1962 novel Ship of Fools was the best-selling novel in America that year, but her short stories received much more critical acclaim. Biography Katherine Anne Porter was born in Indian Creek, Texas as Callie Russell Porter to Harrison Boone Porter and Mary Alice (Jones) Porter. Her family tree can be traced back to American frontiersman Daniel Boone and the writer O. Henry (William Sydney Porter), her father's second cousin.Johnston, Laurie. \\"Katherine Anne Porter Dies at 90; Won a Pulitzer for Short Stories\\". The New York Times, September 19, 1980. childhood home in Kyle was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. In 1892, when Porter was two years old, her mother died two months after giving birth. Porter's father took his four surviving children (an older brother had died in infancy) to live with his mother, Catherine Ann Porter, in Kyle, Texas. The depth of her grandmother's influence can be inferred from Porter's later adoption of her name. Her grandmother died while taking eleven-year-old Callie to visit relatives in Marfa, Texas. After her grandmother's death, the family lived in several towns in Texas and Louisiana, staying with relatives or living in rented rooms. She was enrolled in free schools wherever the family was living, and for a year in 1904 she attended the Thomas School, a private Methodist school in San Antonio, Texas. This was her only formal education beyond grammar school. In 1906, at age sixteen, Porter left home and married John Henry Koontz in Lufkin, Texas. She subsequently converted to his religion, Roman Catholicism.Unrue 2005, p. 45. Koontz, the son of a wealthy Texas ranching family, was physically abusive; once while drunk, he threw her down the stairs, breaking her ankle. They divorced officially in 1915. In 1914 she escaped to Chicago, where she worked briefly as an extra in movies. She then returned to Texas and worked the small-town entertainment circuit as an actress and singer. In 1915, she asked that her name be changed to Katherine Anne Porter as part of her divorce decree. Also in 1915, she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and spent the following two years in sanatoria, where she decided to become a writer. It was discovered during that time, however, that she had bronchitis, not TB. In 1917, she began writing for the Fort Worth Critic, critiquing dramas and writing society gossip. In 1918, she wrote for the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado. In the same year, Katherine almost died in Denver during the 1918 flu pandemic. When she was discharged from the hospital months later, she was frail and completely bald. When her hair finally grew back, it was white and remained that color for the rest of her life. Her experience was reflected in her trilogy of short novels, Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939), for which she received the first annual gold medal for literature in 1940 from the Society of Libraries of New York University.Lavers, Norman. \\"Katherine Anne Porter.\\" Critical Survey Of Long Fiction, Fourth Edition (2010): 1. Biography Reference Center. Web. 4 Apr. 2014. In 1919, Porter moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and made her living ghost writing, writing children's stories and doing publicity work for a motion picture company. The year in New York City had a politically radicalizing effect on her; and in 1920, she went to work for a magazine publisher in Mexico, where she became acquainted with members of the Mexican leftist movement, including Diego Rivera. Eventually, however, Porter became disillusioned with the revolutionary movement and its leaders. In the 1920s she also became intensely critical of religion, and remained so until the last decade of her life, when she again embraced the Roman Catholic Church.Unrue 2005, pp.xv-xx (contains a Katherine Anne Porter chronology). Between 1920 and 1930, Porter traveled back and forth between Mexico and New York City and began publishing short stories and essays. Her first published story was \\"Maria Concepcion\\" in The Century Magazine. (In his 1960s novel Providence Island, Calder Willingham had the character Jim fantasize a perfect lover and he called her Maria Concepcion Diaz.) In 1930, she published her first short- story collection, Flowering Judas and Other Stories. An expanded edition of this collection was published in 1935 and received such critical acclaim that it alone virtually assured her place in American literature. In 1926, Porter married Ernest Stock and lived briefly in Connecticut before divorcing him in 1927. Some biographers suggest that Porter suffered several miscarriages, at least one stillbirth between 1910 and 1926, and an abortion; and after contracting gonorrhea from Stock, that she had a hysterectomy in 1927, ending her hopes of ever having a child. Yet Porter's letters to her lovers suggest that she still intimated her menstruation after this alleged hysterectomy. She once confided to a friend that \\"I have lost children in all the ways one can.\\"Unrue 2005, pp. 14, 86. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, Porter enjoyed a prominent reputation as one of America's most distinguished writers, but her limited output and equally-limited sales had her living on grants and advances for most of the era.\\"Obituary: Katherine Anne Porter.\\" Variety, September 24, 1980. During the 1930s, she spent several years in Europe during which she continued to publish short stories. She married Eugene Pressly, a writer, in 1930. In 1938, upon returning from Europe, she divorced Pressly and married Albert Russel Erskine, Jr., a graduate student. He reportedly divorced her in 1942, after discovering her real age and that she was 20 years his senior. Porter became an elected member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1943, and was a writer-in-residence at several colleges and universities, including the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, and the University of Virginia.Hathcock, Barrett. \\"Katherine Anne Porter.\\" Katherine Anne Porter (2005): 1. Biography Reference Center. Web. 4 Apr. 2014. Between 1948 and 1958, she taught at Stanford University, the University of Michigan, Washington and Lee University, and the University of Texas, where her unconventional manner of teaching made her popular with students. Three of Porter's stories were adapted into radio dramas on the program NBC University Theatre. \\"Noon Wine\\" was made into an hour drama in early 1948, and two years later \\"Flowering Judas\\" and \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider\\" each were produced in half-hour dramas on an episode of the hour-long program. Porter herself made two appearances on the radio series giving critical commentary on works by Rebecca West and Virginia Woolf. In the 1950s and 1960s she occasionally appeared on television in programs discussing literature. Porter published her only novel, Ship of Fools, in 1962; it was based on her reminiscences of a 1931 ocean cruise she had taken from Vera Cruz, Mexico, to Germany. The novel's success finally gave her financial security (she reportedly sold the film rights for Ship of Fools for $500,000). Producer David O. Selznick was after the film rights; but United Artists who owned the property, demanded $400,000. The novel was adapted for film by Abby Mann; producer and director Stanley Kramer featured Vivien Leigh in her final film performance. Despite Porter's claim that after the publication of Ship of Fools she would not win any more prizes in America, in 1966 she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the U.S. National Book Award for The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter. That year she was also appointed to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1977, she published The Never-Ending Wrong, an account of the notorious trial and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, which she had protested 50 years earlier. Porter died in Silver Spring, Maryland, on September 18, 1980, at the age of 90, and her ashes were buried next to her mother at Indian Creek Cemetery in Texas. In 1990, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 2905 was placed in Brown County, Texas, to honor the life and career of Porter.\\"THC- Katherine Anne Porter\\".

At its largest, Santa Rosae was roughly 3-4 times bigger than the northern Channel Islands of today, nearly 125 km (77.67 miles) long from east to west. Between about 20,000 and 5,000 years ago, Santa Rosae lost about 70% of its land mass to post-glacial rising sea level, leaving behind a vast submerged landscape currently being explored by scientists. San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa Island comprise the unsubmerged portions of Santa Rosae today. This island was about 5 miles offshore. It broke up between about 11,000 and 9,000 years ago, and the present northern Channel Islands took their shape after the continental ice sheets melted and sea levels rose by about 100 meters. There is evidence to suggest that a now-submerged island, Calafia, lay between Santa Rosae and the mainland. Santa Rosae had a population of pygmy mammoths (Mammuthus exilis), which became extinct roughly 13,000 years ago. On Santa Rosa Island was found the ~13,000-year-old skeleton of Arlington Springs Man, among the oldest human remains yet found in North America. As Santa Rosae was not connected to the mainland at the time, this shows that Paleo-indians settled the island using boats. Archaeological evidence shows that these Paleocoastal peoples had sophisticated maritime technologies and fished, hunted marine mammals and birds, and harvested island plant foods Erlandson, J.M., T.C.

A 2-3 tree is a B-tree of order 3. Nodes on the outside of the tree (leaf nodes) have no children and one or two data elements., p.145-147 2‚àí3 trees were invented by John Hopcroft in 1970. 2‚Äì3 trees are required to be balanced, meaning that each leaf is at the same level. It follows that each right, center, and left subtree of a node contains the same or close to the same amount of data.  Definitions  We say that an internal node is a 2-node if it has one data element and two children. We say that an internal node is a 3-node if it has two data elements and three children. A 4-node, with three data elements, may be temporarily created during manipulation of the tree but is never persistently stored in the tree.

Properties  * Every internal node is a 2-node or a 3-node. * All leaves are at the same level. * All data is kept in sorted order.  Operations   Searching  Searching for an item in a 2‚Äì3 tree is similar to searching for an item in a binary search tree. Since the data elements in each node are ordered, a search function will be directed to the correct subtree and eventually to the correct node which contains the item. # Let be a 2‚Äì3 tree and be the data element we want to find.

Insertion Insertion maintains the balanced property of the tree. To insert into a 2-node, the new key is added to the 2-node in the appropriate order. To insert into a 3-node, more work may be required depending on the location of the 3-node. If the tree consists only of a 3-node, the node is split into three 2-nodes with the appropriate keys and children. Insertion of a number in a 2-3 tree for 3 possible cases. If the target node is a 3-node whose parent is a 2-node, the key is inserted into the 3-node to create a temporary 4-node. In the illustration, the key 10 is inserted into the 2-node with 6 and 9. The middle key is 9, and is promoted to the parent 2-node. This leaves a 3-node of 6 and 10, which is split to be two 2-nodes held as children of the parent 3-node. If the target node is a 3-node and the parent is a 3-node, a temporary 4-node is created then split as above. This process continues up the tree to the root. If the root must be split, then the process of a single 3-node is followed: a temporary 4-node root is split into three 2-nodes, one of which is considered to be the root. This operation grows the height of the tree by one. Parallel operations Since 2-3 trees are similar in structure to red-black trees, parallel algorithms for red-black trees can be applied to 2-3 trees as well.

It integrates resource allocation by marginal productivity (synonymous with free-market capitalism), with policies of resource allocation by social entitlement. The policies which characterise the system are enacted by democratic governments. Democratic capitalism was implemented widely in the 20th century, particularly in Europe and the Western world after the Second World War. The coexistence of capitalism and democracy, particularly in Europe, was supported by the creation of the modern welfare state in the post-war period.Muller, Jerry Z. (March 2013). \\"Capitalism and Inequality\\". Foreign Affairs. The implementation of democratic capitalism typically involves the enactment of policies expanding the welfare state, strengthening the collective bargaining rights of employees, or strengthening competition laws. These policies are enacted in a capitalist economy characterized by the right to private ownership of productive property. Catholic social teaching offers support for a communitarian form of democratic capitalism with an emphasis on the preservation of human dignity.  Definition  Democratic capitalism is a type of political and economic system characterised by resource allocation according to both marginal productivity and social need, as determined by decisions reached through democratic politics. It is marked by democratic elections, freedom, and rule of law, characteristics typically associated with democracy. It retains a free-market economic system with an emphasis on private enterprise. Professor of Entrepreneurship Elias G. Carayannis and Arisitidis Kaloudis, Economics Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), describe democratic capitalism as an economic system which combines robust competitiveness with sustainable entrepreneurship, with the aim of innovation and providing opportunities for economic prosperity to all citizens. Dr Edward Younkins, professor at Wheeling Jesuit University, described democratic capitalism as a ‚Äúdynamic complex of economic, political, moral-cultural, ideological, and institutional forces‚Äù, which serves to maximize social welfare within a free market economy. Youkins states that the system of individual liberty inherent within democratic capitalism supports the creation of voluntary associations, such as labour unions. Philosopher and writer Michael Novak characterised democratic capitalism as a blend of a free-market economy, a limited democratic government, and moral-cultural system with an emphasis on personal freedom. Novak comments that capitalism is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition of democracy. He also proposes that the prominence of democratic capitalism in a society is strongly determined by the religious concepts which drive its customs, institutions, and leaders.  History   Early to mid-20th century  The development of democratic capitalism was influenced by several historical factors, including the rapid economic growth following World War One, the Great Depression, and the political and economic ramifications of World War Two. The growing critique of free-market capitalism and the rise of the notion of social justice in political debate contributed to the adoption of democratic capitalist policies. Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the location of the Bretton Woods Conference At the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, officials from the United States and the United Kingdom and forty-two other nations committed to trade openness. This commitment was made in conjunction with international guidelines which guaranteed autonomy for each country in responding to economic and social demands of its voters. Officials requested international capital controls which would allow governments to regulate their economies while remaining committed to the goals of full employment and economic growth. The adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade supported free trade, while allowing national governments to retain veto power over trade policy. Such developments saw the incorporation of democratic demands into policies based on capitalist economic logic. A display of the flags of the nations which participated in the Bretton Woods Conference, located in the Gold Room at Mount Washington Hotel Democratic capitalism was first widely implemented after the Second World War in the Western world, particularly in North America and Western Europe. Following the severe economic impacts of the war, working classes in the Western world were more inclined to accept capitalist markets in conjunction with political democracy, which enabled a level of social security and improved living standards. In the post-war decades, democratic capitalist policies saw reduced levels of socioeconomic inequality. This was synonymous with the expansion of welfare states, more highly regulated financial and labour markets, and increased political power of labour unions. According to political scientist Wolfgang Merkel, democracy and capitalism coexisted with more complementarity at this time than at any other point in history. Policy makers in Europe and Asia adopted democratic capitalist policies in an attempt to satisfy the social needs of their voters and respond to the challenge of communism. The policies implemented supported the public provision of medical care, improved public housing, aged care, and more accessible education. Guarantees of full employment and the support of private research and innovation became priorities of policy makers. Policy developments were based on the rising notion that free markets required some state intervention to maintain them, provide structure, and address social inequities caused by them. Governments around the world regulated existing markets in an attempt to increase their equity and effectiveness. In order to stabilise the business cycle, the role of government was reconceived by anticommunist leaders in Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, and Japan. An emphasis was placed on supporting economic growth, promoting innovation, and enhancing living standards. This saw the expansion of educational opportunities and public insurance of basic health and aged benefits. = United States = As automated production expanded in the United States, demand for semi skilled workers increased. Combined with the expansion of secondary education, this saw the development of a large working class. The resulting strong economic growth and improved income equality allowed for greater social peace and universal suffrage. Capitalism was viewed as a means of producing the wealth which maintained political freedom, while a democratic government ensured accountable political institutions and an educated labour force with its basic rights fulfilled. = Europe = In the postwar period, free market economic systems with political systems of democracy and welfare states were established in France and Germany. This occurred under the leadership of the Popular Republican Movement in France and the Christian Democratic Union in Germany.  Late 20th century  Following the oil shocks of the 1970s and the productivity slowdown in the United States in the 1980s, politicians and voters maintained strong support for democratic capitalist policies and free markets. Globalisation and free trade were promoted as a means of boosting economic growth, and this saw the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the European Union. Labour market and competition regulations were eased in existing free-market economies, particularly in Anglo-America. Rapid technological innovation and globalisation brought widespread international economic change. Publicly funded democratic capitalist policies were designed and implemented to compensate individuals negatively affected by major, structural economic change. Implemented beginning in the early years of the Cold War, such policies included unemployment benefits, universal or partially universal healthcare, and aged pensions. Post-1970s, the number of public sector jobs available expanded. Ageing populations in Europe, Japan and North America saw large increases in public spending on pensions and healthcare. In the 1980s, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies began reducing corporate taxation, though personal income taxes and public spending on social security programs generally remained stable. Large-scale innovation in production technology throughout the 20th century had widespread economic benefits in many capitalist economies. These benefits contributed to the conciliation of democratic politics and free markets and the widespread acceptance of democratic capitalist policies by voters. From the late 20th century, the tenets of democratic capitalism expanded more broadly beyond North America and Western Europe. = United States = Ronald Reagan, 40th president of the United States After taking office as president in 1981, Ronald Reagan advocated for a reduced role of government, while responding to voters‚Äô skepticism of liberal capitalism by maintaining strong public sector spending. Many voters doubted the ability of free market capitalism to provide consistent peace, security and opportunity, and sought improved living standards, aged care, and educational opportunities for youth. The Reagan administration maintained previous levels of government expenditure on Social Security and Medicare as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). Total government expenditure levels as a percentage of GDP also remained stable under the Reagan administration. = Europe = From the mid-1980s, European leaders began endorsing neoliberal ideas, such as those associated with Reaganomics and Thatcherism, based on the notion of the interdependence of economic and social policy. In this context, European competition law policy developed as a method of curbing the excesses of capitalism, while aligning the economy of the European Union with the existing democratic ideals of European society. This saw the advancement of democratic capitalism throughout the European region. = South Africa = The South African Competition Act of 1998 prioritised the eradication of anticompetitive business practices and the free participation in the economy of all citizens, while maintaining a pro-free-market economy.  Early 21st century  = India = India enacted the Competition Act, 2002 to promote and sustain competition and protect the welfare of market participants, goals synonymous with democratic capitalism.  Implementation  The post-war implementation of democratic capitalism saw the expansion of welfare states and the free collective bargaining rights of employees, alongside market policies designed to ensure full employment. Under democratic capitalism, an autonomous democratic state enacts of policies which in effect create a compromise between upper and lower classes, while remaining compatible with free-market capitalism. Such policies include the establishment or expansion of a welfare state, as a method of mediating social class conflict and catering to the demands of workers. The system is characterised by the establishment of cooperative economic institutions. This includes institutions which facilitate bargaining between government bodies and business and labour organisations such as unions, and those which regulate the relationships between employees and management within private firms. The development of institutions to promote cooperation among public and private economic entities acknowledges the benefits of market competition, while attempting to address the social problems of unrestrained capitalism. Economic security concerns of citizens are addressed through redistributive policies. Such policies include income transfers, such as welfare payment programs and pensions, to support the financial needs of the elderly and the poor. Other policies which promote economic security include social insurance, and the fiscal financing of education and job training programs to stimulate employment. The right to private ownership of productive property is a central tenet of democratic capitalism, and is recognized as a basic liberty of all democratic citizens, as in a regular free-market capitalist economy. According to political philosopher John Tomasi, democratic capitalism addresses social entitlement and justice concerns through the preservation of citizens‚Äô private property rights, allowing citizens to be ‚Äúfree, equal, and self-governing‚Äù. The robust competitiveness and sustainable entrepreneurship which define democratic capitalism are characterised by top- down policies and bottom-up initiatives implemented by democratic governments. Top-down policies are planned and implemented by formal leaders in an organisation, while bottom-up policies involve gradual change initiated and sustained by lower-level members of organisations. Policies implemented are designed to incentivise public and private sector innovation. Examples include strong research and development funding, and policies which protect intellectual property rights.  Competition law  A characteristic of democratic capitalist economies is the democratic enactment of laws and regulations to support competition. Such laws include United States antitrust laws. Competition laws are designed to regulate private sector activities, including the actions of capital asset owners and managers, in order to prevent outcomes which are socially undesirable according to the democratic majority. The implementation of competition law is intended to prevent anti- competitive behaviour that is harmful to the welfare of consumers, while maintaining a free market economy. The implementation of antitrust laws was found to be a characteristic of democratic capitalism specifically, and not regular free-market capitalism.  Conflicts between notions of resource allocation  According to economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, the capitalist markets and democratic policies that characterise democratic capitalism are inherently conflicting. Streeck suggests that under democratic capitalism, governments tend to neglect policies of resource allocation by marginal productivity in favour of those of resource allocation by social entitlement, or vice versa. In particular, he comments that the accelerating inflation of the 1970s in the Western world can be attributed to rising trade- union wage pressure in labour markets and the political priority of full employment, both of which are synonymous with democratic capitalism.  In Catholic social teaching  Pope John Paul II, author of Centesimus annus Catholic texts offer support for a form of socially regulated democratic capitalism. The papal encyclical Centesimus annus, written by Pope John Paul II, emphasizes a vision of a communitarian form of democratic capitalism. The communitarian system of democratic capitalism described promotes respect for individual rights and basic workers‚Äô rights, a virtuous community, and a limited role for the state and the market. According to the encyclical, these characteristics should be combined with a conscious effort to promote institutions which develop character in individuals. The encyclical stressed to decision makers the importance of the dignity of the person and a concern for the poor, while acknowledging the need to balance economic efficiency with social equity. The US Bishops‚Äô 1986 Pastoral Letter Economic Justice for All suggested that specific institutional arrangements be developed to support this form of democratic capitalism. Arrangements proposed included structures of accountability designed to involve all stakeholders, such as employees, customers, local communities, and wider society, in the corporate decision making process, as opposed to stockholders only. The letter offered acceptance for the market economy under the condition that the state intervene where necessary to preserve human dignity.

Opened in 1923, it was the first planned suburban shopping center and the first regional shopping center to accommodate shoppers arriving by car. Planned in 1922 by J. C. Nichols and designed in Moorish Revival style echoing the architecture of Seville, Spain, the Plaza comprises high-end retail establishments, restaurants, and entertainment venues, as well as offices. The Country Club Plaza is named in the Project for Public Spaces' list 60 of the World's Great Places. The center consists of 18 separate buildings representing of retail space and of office space. Location The site is about south of downtown, between 46th Street and Brush Creek to the north and south and between J.C. Nichols Parkway and Madison Avenue to the east and west. The Kansas state line is one mile (1.6 km) to the west. The neighborhoods surrounding the Plaza consist of upscale apartment buildings and mansions, especially those of the Country Club District built along Ward Parkway on the Plaza's southern and southwestern side. The buildings are arrayed along a collection of streets at the northern edge of the Country Club District, which leads the center to blend in with the apartment and office buildings and houses that surround it. Historic firsts Opened in 1923, The Plaza claims several firsts among shopping centers: * the first regional shopping center in the world designed with parking to accommodate shoppers arriving by automobile * the first suburban center with common management and tenant selection * the first suburban center with unified architecture Market Square in Lake Forest, Illinois opened in 1916 and was first with those features, but at only is neighborhood shopping center-size, not a regional center, and also, was built within the central business district of an existing town, i.e. not suburban at that time. History Brush Creek on the Plaza at night The Country Club Plaza was named for the associated Country Club District, the neighborhood developed by J.C. Nichols which surrounded the Kansas City Country Club (now Loose Park). It is situated at the northern terminus of Ward Parkway, a boulevard known for its wide, manicured median lined with fountains and statuary that traverses the Country Club District. Nichols selected the location carefully to provide residents with a direct route to the Plaza along Ward Parkway. Nichols began acquiring the land for the Plaza in 1907, in an area of Kansas City that was then known as Brush Creek Valley. When his plans were first announced, the project was dubbed 'Nichols' Folly' because of the then seemingly undesirable location; at the time, the only developed land in the valley belonged to the Country Day School (now the Pembroke Hill School), and the rest was known for pig farming.. Nichols employed architect Edward Buehler Delk to design the new shopping district. The Plaza opened in 1923 to immediate success, and has lasted with little interruption since that year. New Urbanist land developer Andres Duany noted in Community Builder: The Life & Legacy of J.C. Nichols that the Country Club Plaza has had the longest life of any planned shopping center in the history of the world. One of its oldest retailers is the Jack Henry Clothing company, founded in 1931. For its first four decades, the Plaza combined some higher-end shops, such as Harzfeld's, with a mix of more mid-level retailers such as Sears and Woolworth's, as well such quotidian enterprises as a bowling alley, movie theater, and a grocery store to serve the daily needs of residents of the district.. From around 1970, competition from newer suburban shopping malls led management to reposition the Plaza with luxury hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, higher-end restaurants, and upscale retailers including Gucci, Polo Ralph Lauren, FAO Schwarz, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bally, and Swanson's. Higher-end stores currently located on Country Club Plaza are Tiffany & Co., St. John, Michael Kors, Kate Spade New York, Cole Haan and Eileen Fisher. On September 12, 1977, a major flood of Brush Creek caused severe damage to the Plaza and resulted in a number of deaths. The flood prompted a vast renovation and revitalization of the area that has allowed it not only to survive but to thrive. In 1998, the J.C. Nichols Company merged with Raleigh, North Carolina-based real-estate investment trust Highwoods Properties, who now runs the Country Club Plaza.Staff (undated). \\"Kansas City Office & Retail Space Highwoods Properties Kansas City, Missouri\\" . Highwoods Properties. Retrieved July 31, 2012. On February 19, 2013, a large explosion destroyed JJ's Restaurant on the Plaza. Believed to be caused by a gas leak, the blast left at least one person dead and sixteen injured. According to a statement from Missouri Gas Energy, a contractor doing underground work struck a gas line. Witnesses had reported a strong odor of natural gas in the area most of the afternoon. The initial explosion happened shortly after 6 p.m. and led to a four-alarm fire that caused the restaurant's complete destruction as well as damage to surrounding buildings. JJ's returned in November 2014 to a new location, still in the Country Club Plaza area. In 2016 Highwoods announced plans to sell the retail complex for $660 million to a 50-50 joint venture of Taubman Centers and The Macerich Company. On February 2, 2018, Nordstrom announced it would be moving from Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas to a new space on the Country Club Plaza expected to open in 2021. Layout and use The Giralda Tower, inspired by the original at the Cathedral of Seville. The basic design of the Country Club Plaza reflects classic European influences, especially those of Seville, Spain, yet it does not include a traditional open plaza. There are more than 30 statues, murals, and tile mosaics on display in the area, as well as major architectural reproductions, such as a half-sized Giralda Tower of Seville (the tallest building in the Plaza). The Plaza also includes reproductions of San Francisco's Path of Gold streetlights. Other works of art celebrate the classics, nature, and historical American themes such as westward expansion, and a magnificent fountain featuring four horses rearing up on their hind legs, designed by Henri-L√©on Gr√©ber. Although the Plaza was designed and built to accommodate visitors arriving by automobile, it is unlike modern shopping malls with sprawling parking lots: parking is concealed in multilevel parking garages beneath and behind the shops, or on the rooftops of buildings. The Plaza was also the first shopping center to use the percentage lease, where rents are based on a percentage of the gross receipts of tenants. This concept was novel when Nichols invented it, but it is now a standard practice in commercial leases. Several companies are based in the Country Club Plaza area, including American Century Investments, Russell Stover Candies, Inergy, and Gates Bar-B-Q. Plaza lights In 1925, a single strand of 16 colored lights was placed above a doorway in the Country Club Plaza to celebrate Christmas. The number of lights increased annually, inspiring an official lighting ceremony that first took place in 1930. On Thanksgiving night, tens of thousands of people visit the Plaza for the local entertainment/performances and to watch the switch-throwing to initiate the Christmas season.

The Arlington Springs archeological site is protected within northern Channel Islands National Park, and in Santa Barbara County. History Archaeology In 1959‚Äì1960, two femora were excavated by Phil C. Orr, curator of anthropology and paleontology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, at Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island. Orr believed the remains were those of a 10,000-year-old man and dubbed them the \\"Arlington Springs Man\\". The Arlington Springs Man was later re-examined in 1989 by Orr's successors at the museum, Dr. John R. Johnson and Don Morris. The two came to the initial assessment that the Arlington Springs Man was actually the \\"Arlington Springs Woman\\". Radiocarbon dating determined that the remains dated to 13,000 years BP,Glassow, Michael A. (editor), Todd J. Braje, Julia G. Costello, Jon M. Erlandson, John R. Johnson, Don P. Morris, Jennifer E. Perry, and Torben C. Rick (2014), Technical report. Channel Islands National Park Archaeological Overview and Assessment. making the remains potentially the oldest-known human skeleton in North America. The term \\"Arlington Springs Woman\\" was used at that time to refer to these remains. After further study, Johnson reversed his gender assessment in 2006, concluding that the remains were more likely those of a man, and the name \\"Arlington Springs Man\\" was again the more appropriate name. Geology The Paleoindian Arlington Springs Man lived on the former Pleistocene epoch Santa Rosae island. During the last ice age, the four northern Channel Islands were held together as the one mega-island of Santa Rosae. The weather was much cooler and the sea level was lower than today. His presence on an island at such an early date demonstrates that the earliest Paleoindians had watercraft capable of crossing the Santa Barbara Channel, and lends credence as well to a \\"coastal migration\\" theory for the peopling of the Americas, using boats to travel south from Siberia and Alaska.

This symphony is nicknamed The Drumroll after the long roll on the timpani with which it begins. It is from 1795, and his second-to-last symphony. Composition and premiere The symphony was the eleventh of twelve that were composed for performance in England during Haydn's two journeys there (1791‚Äì1792, 1794‚Äì1795), arranged and organized by the great impresario, Johann Peter Salomon. Haydn's music was well known in England well before the composer traveled there, and members of the British musical public had long expressed the wish that Haydn would visit. The composer's reception in England was in fact very enthusiastic, and the English visits were one of the most fruitful and happy periods of the composer's life. Haydn composed the \\"Drumroll\\" Symphony while living in London during the winter of 1794‚Äì1795. It was premiered on March 2, 1795 as part of a concert series called the \\"Opera Concerts\\" at the King's Theatre. The orchestra was unusually large for the time, consisting of about 60 players. The task of directing the work was divided between the concertmaster, the violinist Giovanni Battista Viotti, and Haydn, who sat at a fortepiano. The premiere was evidently a success, and The Morning Chronicle's reviewer wrote: The Sun wrote: Haydn later performed the work in Vienna, and for this purpose made a small cut in the final movement, which is usually respected by conductors today. Since its premiere, the \\"Drumroll\\" Symphony has been a favorite among Haydn's symphonies, and it is frequently performed and recorded today. In 1831, Richard Wagner arranged it for piano.Deathridge J., Geck M. and Voss E. (1986). Wagner Werk-Verzeichnis (WWV): Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke Richard Wagners und ihrer Quellen (\\"Catalogue of Wagner's Works: Catalogue of Musical Compositions by Richard Wagner and Their Sources\\"). Mainz, London, & New York: Schott Musik International. pp. 76 ‚Äì 77 The symphony takes about 30 minutes to perform. Scoring The work is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings. Movements The work is in standard four-movement form. I. Adagio ‚Äì Allegro con spirito After the opening drum roll, the bass instruments play a somber opening theme: :528px As commentators have pointed out,Among them: Schroeder 1985, 71 the first four notes of which match the Dies Irae chant, part of the Latin mass for the dead: :600px H. C. Robbins Landon has remarked that at the start the theme is ambiguous between duple and triple timeRobbins Landon 1976, 595 and between the keys of C minor and (what ultimately proves the case) E major. The sprightly Allegro con spirito that follows this introduction is in sonata form and time with an extended transition to the secondary theme. In a number of places, it restates the theme of the introduction in much faster tempo.Schroeder 1985, 71 Haydn restates part of the opening introduction in the coda, a formal procedure previously adopted by Mozart in his String Quintet K. 593 (1790). Beethoven was to do the same in his \\"Path√©tique\\" piano sonata, published two years after the \\"Drumroll\\" Symphony in 1797. II. Andante pi√π tosto allegretto In double variation form, with alternating themes in C minor and C major plus coda. The double variations had been a favorite musical form of the composer for about 20 years. Along with the Piano Trio H. XV:23 from the same year, this was the last set he wrote. The themes are said to have been developed by Haydn from Croatian folk songs he knew ‚Äì for discussion, see Haydn and folk music. Some different features in this movement include a long violin solo, as well as the lack of clarinets. III. Menuetto The minuet is in the home key of E major. Charles Rosen, in The Classical Style, chose this minuet to illustrate the point that Classical-era minuets often have very strong first beats, in contrast to the more flowing rhythm of the Baroque minuet.Rosen, Charles. \\"The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven\\". p. 90. New York: Norton, 1997. Theme 3 of part of Symphony No. 103 of Haydn IV. Finale: Allegro con spirito The finale is in fast tempo, has a monothematic exposition, and is in sonata rondo form. Like the first movement, it begins with a quasi-ritual gesture ‚Äì in this case, a horn call: :File:Horn fifths haydn.JPG The horn call is followed by a pause, then repeated as accompaniment to the main theme, and indeed echoed throughout the movement. Like the themes of the second movement, the opening melody was claimed by Franjo Kuhaƒç to be taken by Haydn from Croatian folk song, in this case a tune called \\"Divojƒçica potok gazi\\" (\\"A little girl treads on a brook\\").Robbins Landon (1976:602); for the tune see Robbins Landon or online. Robbins Landon notes that this finale one of the longest in the London Symphonies. He calls it \\"one of the great tours-de- force, formally speaking, of Haydn's career: the creation of a long movement on a single theme in which our interest never flags; on the contrary, it is a Finale of unusual tension and strength.\\"Robbins Landon (1976:602‚Äì603) Rather unusually for Haydn,Robbins Landon (1976:602) he altered the fourth movement after it was completed, removing 13 bars fairly close to the end. The original autograph score preserves this music; it modulates to the key of C major and includes a two-measure rest; with the dynamic markings and .The deleted passage is printed in Robbins Landon (1976:603‚Äì604). Robbins Landon suggests that Haydn removed the passage because it \\"would hold up the course of the movement.\\"Robbins Landon (1976:602) The symphony is occasionally performed with the deleted passage included; e.g. in recorded versions by Antal Dor√°ti and Frans Br√ºggen.

These can be found on many chromosomes, and often show variations in length (number of repeats) among individuals. Each variant acts as an inherited allele, allowing them to be used for personal or parental identification. Their analysis is useful in genetics and biology research, forensics, and DNA fingerprinting. Schematic of a Variable Number of Tandem Repeats in 4 alleles. Variations of VNTR (D1S80) allele lengths in 6 individuals. Structure and allelic variation In the schematic above, the rectangular blocks represent each of the repeated DNA sequences at a particular VNTR location. The repeats are in tandem ‚Äì i.e. they are clustered together and oriented in the same direction. Individual repeats can be removed from (or added to) the VNTR via recombination or replication errors, leading to alleles with different numbers of repeats. Flanking regions are segments of non-repetitive sequence (shown here as thin lines), allowing the VNTR blocks to be extracted with restriction enzymes and analyzed by RFLP, or amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and their size determined by gel electrophoresis. Use in genetic analysis VNTRs were an important source of RFLP genetic markers used in linkage analysis (mapping) of diploid genomes. Now that many genomes have been sequenced, VNTRs have become essential to forensic crime investigations, via DNA fingerprinting and the CODIS database. When removed from surrounding DNA by the PCR or RFLP methods, and their size determined by gel electrophoresis or Southern blotting, they produce a pattern of bands unique to each individual. When tested with a group of independent VNTR markers, the likelihood of two unrelated individuals' having the same allelic pattern is extremely low. VNTR analysis is also being used to study genetic diversity and breeding patterns in populations of wild or domesticated animals. As such, VNTRs can be used to distinguish strains of bacterial pathogens. In this microbial forensics context, such assays are usually called Multiple Loci VNTR Analysis or MLVA. Chromosomal locations of the 13 VNTR loci in the CODIS panel. Inheritance In analyzing VNTR data, two basic genetic principles can be used: * Identity Matching ‚Äì both VNTR alleles from a specific location must match. If two samples are from the same individual, they must show the same allele pattern. * Inheritance Matching ‚Äì the VNTR alleles must follow the rules of inheritance. In matching an individual with his parents or children, a person must have an allele that matches one from each parent. If the relationship is more distant, such as a grandparent or sibling, then matches must be consistent with the degree of relatedness. Relationship to other types of repetitive DNA Repetitive DNA, representing over 40% of the human genome, is arranged in a bewildering array of patterns. Repeats were first identified by the extraction of Satellite DNA, which does not reveal how they are organized. The use of restriction enzymes showed that some repeat blocks were interspersed throughout the genome. DNA sequencing later showed that other repeats are clustered at specific locations, with tandem repeats being more common than inverted repeats (which may interfere with DNA replication). VNTRs are the class of clustered tandem repeats that exhibit allelic variation in their lengths. Classes This shows a theoretical example of a VNTR in two different individuals. A single strand of DNA from each individual is displayed in which there is tandem repeat sequence that the individuals share. The sequence presence is a VNTR because one individual has five repeats, while the other has seven repeats (number of repeats varies in different individuals). Each repeat is ten nucleotides, making it a minisatellite, rather than a microsatellite in which each repeat is 1-6 nucleotides. VNTRs are a type of minisatellite in which the size of the repeat sequence is generally ten to one hundred base pairs. Minisatellites are a type of DNA tandem repeat sequence, meaning that the sequences repeat one after another without other sequences or nucleotides in between them. Minisatellites are characterized by a repeat sequence of about ten to one hundred nucleotides, and the number of times the sequence repeats varies from about five to fifty times. The sequences of minisatellites are larger than those of microsatellites, in which the repeat sequence is generally 1 to 6 nucleotides. The two types of repeat sequences are both tandem but are specified by the length of the repeat sequence. VNTRs, therefore, because they have repeat sequences of ten to one hundred nucleotides in which every repeat is exactly the same, are considered minisatellites. However, while all VNTRs are minisatellites, not all minisatellites are VNTRs. VNTRs can vary in number of repeats from individual to individual, as where some non-VNTR minisatellites have repeat sequences that repeat the same number of times in all individuals containing the tandem repeats in their genomes.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/education/dna/vntr.pdfhttps://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/redundant- content/event-microsites/bio/Dubrova.pdf See also * AFLP * Microsatellite * Minisatellite * MLVA * Short tandem repeat * Tandem repeat  Software for MLVA typing  * BioNumerics (using the BioNumerics MIRU-VNTR plugin specifically developed for running a popular MLVA assay genotyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains) References  External links  *Examples : ** VNTRs ‚Äì info and animated example *Databases : ** The Microorganisms Tandem Repeats Database ** The MLVAbank ** Short Tandem Repeats Database ** Tandem Repeats Database (TRDB) *Search tools : **TAPO: A combined method for the identification of tandem repeats in protein structures ** Tandem Repeats Finder ** Mreps ** STAR ** TRED ** TandemSWAN ** Microsatellite repeats finder ** JSTRING ‚Äì Java Search for Tandem Repeats in genomes ** Phobos ‚Äì a tandem repeat search tool for perfect and imperfect repeats ‚Äì the maximum pattern size depends only on computational power * Category:Repetitive DNA sequences ","title":"Variable number tandem repeat"},{"id":"647279","text":"Technosexual is an individual who either: # has a strong aesthetic sense and a love of gadgets.

Fougera & Co., makers of the generic cream widely used in the United States as Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream, 2.5%/2.5%, recommends different timing for application of the cream as well as length of anesthesia. They state the cream must be applied at least one hour before the start of a routine procedure and for two hours before the start of a painful procedure. Additionally, they state that the duration of effective skin anesthesia will be at least one hour after removal of the occlusive dressing.Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream, 2.5%/2.5%, package insert. E.

The curve itself is about long and in diameter; it was completed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a way to lessen the grade to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains. It eventually replaced the time-consuming Allegheny Portage Railroad, the only other route across the mountains for large vehicles. The rail line has been important since its opening, and during World War II the Curve was targeted by Nazi Germany in 1942 as part of Operation Pastorius. The Curve was later owned and used by Pennsylvania Railroad successors Penn Central, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern. Horseshoe Curve was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966, and it became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2004. Horseshoe Curve has long been a tourist attraction, as a trackside observation park had been completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a visitor center built in the early 1990s. The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages the center, which has exhibits pertaining to the curve.  Location and design  Topographic map of the area around the Horseshoe Curve Horseshoe Curve is on the Pittsburgh Line, the Norfolk Southern Railway Pittsburgh Division main line between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Westbound trains climb a maximum grade of 1.85 percent for from Altoona to Gallitzin; just west of the Gallitzin Tunnels trains pass the summit of the Allegheny Mountains, then descend for to Johnstown on a grade of 1.1 percent or less. The curve is west of Altoona in Logan Township, Blair County, at railroad milepost 242\\\\. The Blair County Veterans Memorial Highway (SR 4008) follows the valley west from Altoona and tunnels under the curve.Act of Dec. 4, 1992, P.L. 775, No. 120. Horseshoe Curve bends around a dam and lake, the highest of three reservoirs along the valley which are owned by the Altoona Water Authority and supply water to the city. Horseshoe Curve spans two ravines formed by creeks: Kittanning Run on the north side of the valley, and Glenwhite Run on the south. For every , the tracks at the Horseshoe Curve bend 9 degrees and 15 minutes with the entire curve totaling 220 degrees. The curve is long and, at its widest, about across. The Horseshoe Curve descends from an approximate elevation of on the southern side to on the northern. The grade of the curve was listed by the Pennsylvania Railroad as 1.45 percent, and currently as 1.34 percent by Norfolk Southern. Each track consists of , welded rails that were, , laid in 2011. Prior to dieselization and the introduction of dynamic braking and rail oilers, the rails along the curve would be transposed--left to right and vice versa--to equalize the wear on each rail from the flanges of passing steam locomotives and rail cars, thereby extending their lifespan.  History  Four trains on four tracks passing each other on Pennsylvania Railroad mainline near the curve, Origin In 1834 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania built the Allegheny Portage Railroad across the Allegheny Mountains to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, as part of the Main Line of Public Works. The Portage Railroad was a series of canals and inclined planes and remained in use until the mid-19th century. The Pennsylvania Railroad was incorporated in 1847 to build a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, replacing the cumbersome Portage Railroad. Construction Using surveys completed in 1842, the state's engineers recommended a route west from Lewistown that followed the ridges with a maximum grade of 0.852 percent on the line. The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad, John Edgar Thomson, instead chose a route on lower, flatter terrain along the Juniata River and accepted the resulting steeper grade west of Altoona. The valley west of Altoona was split into two ravines by a mountain; surveys had already found a route with an acceptable grade east from Gallitzin to the south side of the valley, and Horseshoe Curve allowed the same grade to continue to Altoona. Engineers built an earth fill over the first ravine encountered while ascending, formed by Kittanning Run, cut the point of the mountain between the ravines, and filled in the second ravine, formed by Glenwhite Run. stereo card of a train on the curve, c.1907 Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850 and took over three years. It was done without heavy equipment, only men \\"with picks and shovels, horses and drags\\". The entire line, including Horseshoe Curve, opened on February 15, 1854. The total cost for of track between Altoona and Johnstown was $2,495,000 or $80,225 per mile ($49,850 /km). The remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled in 1879 to allow the construction of a park and observation area--the first built for viewing trains. As demand for train travel increased, a third track was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later. From around the 1860s to just before World War II passengers could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads connected to the main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built at the apex of the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940. Horseshoe Curve was depicted in brochures, calendars and other promotional material; Pennsylvania Railroad stock certificates were printed with a vignette of it. The Pennsylvania pitted the scenery of Horseshoe Curve against rival New York Central Railroad's \\"Water Level Route\\" during the 1890s. A raised-relief, scale model of the curve was included as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad's exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Pennsylvania Railroad conductors were told to announce the Horseshoe Curve to daytime passengers--a tradition that continues aboard Amtrak trains.  World War II and post-war  During World War II PRR carried troops and mat√©riel for the Allied war effort, and the Curve was under armed guard. The military intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the Abwehr, plotted to sabotage important industrial assets in the United States in a project code-named Operation Pastorius. In June 1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island, planning to destroy such sites as the Curve, Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River. The would-be saboteurs were quickly apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after one, George John Dasch, turned himself in. Centennial celebration photo During the 1954 celebration of the centennial of the opening of Horseshoe Curve, a night photo was arranged by Sylvania Electric Products using 6,000 flashbulbs and of wiring to illuminate the area. The event also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb. Pennsylvania steam locomotive 1361 was placed at the park inside the Horseshoe Curve on June 8, 1957. It is one of 425 K4s-class engines, the principal passenger locomotives on the Pennsylvania Railroad that regularly plied the curve. The Horseshoe Curve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966. The operation of the observation park was transferred to the city of Altoona the same year. The Pennsylvania Railroad was combined with the New York Central Railroad in 1968. The merger created Penn Central, which went bankrupt and was taken over by the federal government in 1976, as part of the merger that created Conrail. The second track from the inside at the Horseshoe CurveFor a description and photos of the curve when it still had four tracks, see \\"Rail Guide to the Horseshoe Curve.\\" (1976, PC Publications). was removed by Conrail in 1981. The K4s 1361 was removed from the curve for a restoration to working order in September 1985 and was replaced with the ex-Conrail EMD GP9 diesel-electric locomotive 7048 that was repainted into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme. Starting in June 1990, the park at the Horseshoe Curve underwent a $5.8 million renovation funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and by the National Park Service through its \\"America's Industrial Heritage Project\\". The renovations were completed in April 1992 with the dedication of a new visitor center. In 1999 Conrail was divided between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern, with the Horseshoe Curve being acquired by the latter. The Horseshoe Curve was lit up again with fireworks and rail-borne searchlights during its sesquicentennial in 2004 as an homage to the celebrations in 1954. It was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2004.  Current operations  Three Norfolk Southern freight trains pass each other on the curve in 2006. Train count peaked in the 1940s with over 50 passenger trains per day along with many freight and military trains. Demand for train travel dropped greatly after World War II as highway and air travel became popular. The curve is still busy as part of Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line and, , was passed by 51 scheduled freight trains each day, not including locals and helper engines which can double the number. The EMD SD40-2s and SD40Es helpers are coupled to the rear of long trains, providing power on the ascent and assisting in braking on the descent. The 2012 Norfolk Southern track chart lists the annual traffic density passing Horseshoe Curve as , including locomotives. Amtrak's Pennsylvanian between Pittsburgh and New York City rounds the curve once each way daily. Average speed for trains at Horseshoe Curve are for freight and approximately for passenger trains. The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages a visitor center next to the curve which is open April to October. The center has historical artifacts and memorabilia relating to the curve, and a raised-relief map of the Altoona-Johnstown area. Access to the curve is by a funicular or a 194-step stairway. The funicular is single-tracked, with the cars passing each other halfway up the slope; the cars are painted to resemble Pennsylvania Railroad passenger cars. Along with the locomotive, a former \\"watchman's shanty\\" is in the park. Horseshoe Curve is popular with railfans, especially as watchers might see three trains passing at once. As part of Norfolk Southern's 21st Century Steam program, the former Nickel Plate Road steam locomotive No. 765 traversed Horseshoe Curve in August 2012--the first steam locomotive to do so since 1977--while deadheading to and from Harrisburg. Nickel Plate 765 returned to the curve in May 2013 with public excursion trains from Lewistown to Gallitzin.

She was constructed in 1806 at the Washington Navy Yard, was commissioned sometime in 1807, Master Commandant John Smith in command. In 1812 she captured , but was immediately herself captured. The British took her into service first as HMS Loup Cervier and then as HMS Peacock. She was lost, presumed foundered with all hands, in mid-1814. US Service In 1808 Wasp was heavily involved in supporting Jefferson's Embargo, including delivering an army garrison from New York City to Passamaquoddy in June, patrolling Casco Bay, Maine, in the winter of 1808-1809, and remaining at Portland until May, 1809. Until 1809 she was commanded by Master Commandant John Smith. In the final weeks of 1810, she was operating from the ports of Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, presumably patrolling the waters along southern Atlantic coast. In 1811, she sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she and the brig joined frigates and in forming a squadron commanded by Commodore Stephen Decatur.U.S.Navy, DANFS, Wasp prgh.1 On 9 March 1812 Wasp sailed from New York for France to deliver an adventurer named John Henry who had sold correspondence to President Madison indicating Britain's interest in determining if the New England states wished to secede from the union. The correspondence, known as the Henry Papers, helped build outrage in Congress against Britain that led to the declaration of war. USS Wasp boarding HMS Frolic Wasp, under the command of Master Commandant Jacob Jones continued to operate along the coast of the middle states after the United States went to war with Britain in June 1812.Roosevelt, 1883 p.100 Her single action came in October. On 13 October, she sailed from the Delaware River and two days later encountered a heavy gale that tore away her jib boom and also washed two crewmen overboard. The following evening, Wasp encountered a squadron of ships and, in spite of the fact that two of their number appeared to be large men-of-war, made for them straight away. She finally caught the enemy convoy the following morning and discovered six merchantmen under the protection of a 22-gun sloop-of-war, HMS Frolic.Roosevelt, 1883 pp.104-106U.S.Navy, DANFS, Wasp prgh.3 At half past eleven in the morning of 18 October, Wasp and Frolic closed to do battle, commencing fire at a distance of . In a short, sharp, fight, both ships sustained heavy damage to masts and rigging, but Wasp prevailed over her adversary by boarding her. Unfortunately for Wasp, a British 74-gun ship-of- the-line, , appeared on the scene. Frolic was crippled and Wasps rigging and sails were badly damaged. At 4:00 PM Jones had no choice but to surrender Wasp; he could neither run nor fight such an overwhelming opponent.Malcomson, 2006 p.429 British service Wasp was briefly given the name Loup Cervier on her capture.Winfield (2008), p.273.Loup cervier is the French name for the Canada lynx. She was commissioned in 1813 on the Halifax station under Captain Charles Gill. Captain William William Mends succeeded Gill, taking command on 26 February 1813. In June Loup Cervier was off New London, where she helped blockade the squadron under Commodore Stephen Decatur. James Biddle, who had been first lieutenant of Wasp, had become captain of . He issued a challenge to Mends that their two vessels meet in an engagement. Decatur forbade the engagement until he was sure that it would be an even match. The day after he gave his assent Loup Cervier left New London to patrol elsewhere.Dennie (2009), Vol. 3, pp.400-1. Thereafter Loup Cervier captured or recaptured four vessels. On 27 June she captured the schooner Little Bill, John Roach master, which had been sailing from St Bartholomew to North Carolina. She was carrying a cargo of sugar and molasses. Little Bill was restored.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.318. Another report gives the vessel's name as Little Bell.Lloyd's List, no.4803, - accessed 2 February 2014. Then on 28 August Loup Cervier captured the ship Hope, of 468 tons (bm), J. Emery master. Hope was sailing from Lisbon to Newport, Rhode Island with a cargo of salt. She too was restored.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.268. On 29 October Loup Cervier recaptured the brig John and Mary, T. Collins, master.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.272. Lastly, Loup Cervier was one of four British warships that shared in the capture of the sloop Emeline, of 44 tons (bm), O. Adams, master. Emeline was sailing from New York to Rhode Island with a cargo of 240 barrels of flour.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.158. At some point Loup Cervier was renamed Peacock, Hornet having captured and sunk the in February 1813. Mends was appointed to command of on 23 March 1814.Mends (1899), p.350. Peacock may then have been briefly under the command of Captain G. Donnett. In April or shortly thereafter Commander Richard Coote of was promoted to post captain and transferred to Peacock.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 37, p.190. Peacock was one of the five British warships that on 21 April 1814 captured the Swedish brig Minerva. Then on 15 May, Peacock recaptured the Swedish ship Providentia, of four guns, 400 tons, and 17 men. She had been sailing from Amelia Island to Lisbon with a cargo of pine, cedar, etc. when an American privateer had captured her. That same day, Peacock recaptured the Russian ship Hendrick, of eight guns, 80 tons, and 13 men. She had been sailing from Amelia Island to Amsterdam with a cargo of pine and cotton when captured. Fate Peacock was under Coote's command when she disappeared off the Virginia Capes.Hepper (1994), p.150. She apparently had foundered on 23 July 1814.

More generally, a half-space is either of the two parts into which a hyperplane divides an affine space. That is, the points that are not incident to the hyperplane are partitioned into two convex sets (i.e., half-spaces), such that any subspace connecting a point in one set to a point in the other must intersect the hyperplane. A half-space can be either open or closed. An open half-space is either of the two open sets produced by the subtraction of a hyperplane from the affine space. A closed half-space is the union of an open half-space and the hyperplane that defines it. If the space is two-dimensional, then a half-space is called a half-plane (open or closed). A half-space in a one-dimensional space is called a half-line or ray. A half-space may be specified by a linear inequality, derived from the linear equation that specifies the defining hyperplane.

Completed in 1930, she initially served with the Mediterranean Fleet. She was sunk on 31 December 1942 during the Battle of the Barents Sea.  Design and description  In the mid-1920s, the RN ordered two destroyers from two different builders, , built by Yarrow, and , built by Thornycroft, incorporating the lessons learned from World War I, as prototypes for future classes. The A-class destroyers were based on Amazon, slightly enlarged and carrying two more torpedo tubes.English, p. 14 They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of .Whitley, p. 97 Acasta was powered by a pair of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a speed of . During her sea trials, she reached a maximum speed of from . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The complement of the A-class ships was 134 officers and ratings and increased to 143 by 1940.March, p. 258 Their main armament consisted of four QF 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mk IX guns in single mounts, in two superfiring pairs in front of the bridge and aft of the superstructure. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between their funnels. The ships were fitted with two above-water quadruple mounts for torpedoes. Carrying the minesweeping paravanes on the quarterdeck limited depth charge chutes to three with two depth charges provided for each chute.March, p. 247 The A-class destroyers were given space for an ASDIC system, but it was not initially fitted.Friedman, p. 197 Ship history Battle of the Denmark Strait In early May 1941, the British Admiralty was on the alert that the German battleship might attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, so Achates was ordered to Scapa Flow for possible deployment against the Germans. On 22 May, just after midnight, Achates sailed along with the destroyers , , , , and , escorting the battlecruiser and the battleship to cover the northern approaches. The intention was that the force would refuel in Hvalfjord, Iceland, and then sail again to watch the Denmark Strait. On the evening of 23 May, weather started getting bad. At 2055 hrs., Admiral Lancelot Holland aboard Hood signaled the destroyers \\"If you are unable to maintain this speed I will have to go on without you. You should follow at your best speed.\\" At 0215 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to spread out at intervals to search to the north. At about 0535, the German forces were sighted by Hood, and shortly after, the Germans sighted the British ships. Firing commenced at 0552. At 0601, Hood suffered a massive explosion, sinking the ship within two minutes. Electra and the other destroyers were about away at the time. Upon hearing that Hood had sunk, Electra raced to the area, arriving about two hours after Hood went under. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed life belts on the deck where they could be quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 enlisted men who were aboard Hood, only three survivors were found. Electra rescued these survivors, and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area. Kirkenes and Torch In July 1941, while taking position in the screen of carriers preparing for the air strike against Kirkenes/Petsamo, Achates was mined and severely damaged, but managed to make port for repairs. On 8 November 1942, while deployed off Oran, Algeria for operation \\"Torch\\", Achates detected, and attacked the Vichy French submarine , which had sortied to contest the Allied landings in the area. Achates attack on Argonaute, saw the rise of oil to the surface of the sea and huge air bubbles, as well as debris from both inside, and outside the submarine. Following this, at a later point, HMS Westcott made a further attack, hence both ships were credited with her demise. Battle of the Barents Sea On 31 December 1942, Achates was on escort duty protecting the convoy JW 51B en route from Loch Ewe to Murmansk when she was sunk in the Barents Sea The German heavy cruiser , pocket battleship L√ºtzow and six large destroyers had been ordered to attack and destroy the convoy. Despite being heavily outgunned the escort, under the command of Captain R. St. Vincent Sherbrooke, beat off the attack and not one merchant vessel was lost. At 11:15, Achates was laying smoke to protect the convoy when she was hit by gunfire from Admiral Hipper, killing the commanding officer, Lt Cdr Johns, and forty crew. The First Lieutenant, Lt L. E. Peyton- Jones, took over command and, despite having sustained severe damage in the shelling, Achates continued her smoke screen operation. At 13:30 she went down ESE of Bear Island. 113 seamen were lost and 81 were rescued, one of whom later died on the trawler Northern Gem which had come to the aid of Achates. In response, the light cruiser damaged Admiral Hipper, and subsequently sank her escort, . References Bibliography   External links * Coxswain in the Northern Convoys by S.A.

The gap is located effectively in a western suburb of Altoona, PA. The maps on this page also are showing the nearby PRR Horseshoe Curve which crosses three other gaps and the confluence of Kittanning Run with . The Kittanning Gap gives this 'choice way' of climbing the escarpment to wagons or mule trains on the way to the west side of the Allegheny Mountains and Kittanning, PA along the Kittanning Path. Taking a right through the gap to climb up the escarpment was a bit easier than either steep narrow creek beds straight ahead.. A zoomed in view of the image above showing the Location of Kittanning Gap, along a minor freshet (seasonal) tributary of the Glen White Run well below the confluence of Kittanning Run. USGS combined topological and relief map mode view with search object 'Kittanning Run'. The Web software identifies the search item with short yellow point icon containing the 'A' (circled). Note that this 'official USGS confluence' is several miles from the official USGS Kittanning Gap. The dark trace forming a hairpin turn directly below that marker is the Pennsylvania Railroad's famous Horseshoe Curve. Kittanning Gap, one of the gaps of the Allegheny, is a now a relatively unimportant wooded ravine (water gap) along the ascent (at the foot) of the Allegheny Ridge (also called the 'Allegheny Front' or 'Allegheny escarpment') in central Pennsylvania in the United States. The gap was one of several optional paths of the Kittanning Path Amerindian trail turned into an emigrant route over the Alleghenies in the day of animal powered technology. The option up the gap was likely the 'better choice' of an ascending route for ox cart and wagon (such as those made downstream in Conestoga, Pennsylvania) encumbered white settlers pouring west across the Alleghenies escarpment. The 1780s-1830s saw an increasing flood of emigrants into the Ohio Country and territories beyond after (and well before) the end of the American Revolution. It is located in Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania just west of Altoona, PA, overlooking the former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage beginning to climb up alongside Glen White Run to the hard hairpin turn that begins at the confluence with the Kittanning Run before its famous traverse bends around in the famous Horseshoe Curve approximately 5 mi (8 km) west of Altoona. The USGS does not use the Kittanning Run stream for an eponymous gap name since it follows local naming conventions and traditions. The Kittanning Gap is formed from the erosion valley of a seasonal freshet, so is lightly eroded compared to other gaps of the Allegheny which have larger flow volumes resulting in narrower, deeper valleys with steeper, harder to traverse walls. However, topographical analysis shows the climb up from the Altoona Plateau up to the Allegheny Plateau through Kittanning Gap would bend first northerly then curve gradually climbing along several diverse hill sides as to path hooked back to resume a westward heading in the valley of Clearfield Creek coming out in the vicinity of Ashville, Pennsylvania but about a half-mile distant and on the opposite side of the summit that sources the Kittanning Run. In short, climbing more quickly and directly up the escarpment via either the valleys of Kittanning Run or Glen White Run was likely the route of choice (when footing was good) for foot traffic and mule trains, whilst the longer more round about but easier climb up the Kittanning Gap gave animal drawn wagon and carts the better easier path. Any one of these variations were collectively parts of the Kittanning Path as it became known. History In the 18th century the Kittanning Path passed through the gap, providing a route between central and western Pennsylvania for Native Americans and early white settlers. Why the gap is left of the Kittanning Run can only be speculated upon, but a topographical examination suggests for 16th-19th century peoples on foot or pulling a cart or Conestoga wagon, turning right up the gap would lead them across gentler climbing terrains, so may have been the path of choice. The Kittanning Path lower valley was later selected as the climbing approach for the 1845 railroad line chartered (ordered, in effect) to cross the Allegheny Mountains. The challenge of constructing a railroad through the ridge led to the construction of the unique Horseshoe Curve in 1854, once trumpeted as the world's busiest railway, and now designated as a National Historic Landmark.

After being taken over by the U.S. military (800th Military Police Brigade) in April 2003, it was renamed after Ronald Bucca, a NYC fire marshal who died in the 11 September 2001 attacks. The site where Camp Bucca was built had earlier housed the tallest structure in Iraq, a 492-meter-high TV mast. After the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, many detainees from Abu Ghraib were transferred to Bucca, where US authorities hoped to showcase a model detention facility. Housing a significant portion of the leadership of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Bucca became a training ground for Islamic extremism, and contributed to the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Camp Bucca interned later ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who enjoyed good relations with camp authorities while there. On 17 September 2009, the US military announced that the base would be closed. In December 2010, the U.S. military handed the base to the government of Iraq, who, on the same day, gave Kufan Group of Iraq a license to invest in the new Basra Gateway, to provide a hub for Iraq's port. Significant events 2003 On 18 May 2003, U.S. military forces mistakenly released Mohammed Jawad An-Neifus from the Camp Bucca. An-Neifus is suspected of being involved in the mass murder of thousands of Iraqi Shias whose remains were later found at a mass gravesite in the southern city of al-Mahawil. 2004 On 26 January 2004 three detainees escaped at night during a period of intense fog. An investigation \\"concluded that the detainees crawled under a fence when visibility was only 10‚Äì15 meters due to fog\\". On 19 October 2004, a 26-year-old security internee died of unknown causes. 2005 On 5 January 2005, a 31-year-old security internee died of what appears to be natural causes. In April 2004, in Compound 4, a riot broke out in which detainees threw rocks and fashioned weapons out of tent poles. Detainees held a military soldier hostage until the riot was dispelled by the use of lethal force. Four detainees were killed and six were injured. As is standard procedure in all cases of prison riots and the use of lethal force, the matter was investigated by the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigations Division. The investigation concluded that a detainee leader had incited the riot by making an accusation that camp soldiers were stepping on Korans during a search for contraband. No soldiers were found guilty of any wrongdoing during the incident. On 5 February 2005, the tabloid paper New York Daily News reported that units at Camp Bucca organized and held a mud wrestling party on 30 October 2004. The party was organized by members of the 160th MP Battalion. On 25 March 2005, a complete escape tunnel was discovered, though no prisoners had yet managed to escape. On 1 April 2005, two Iraqis and four US prison guards were wounded in a riot at Camp Bucca near the southern town of Umm Qasr. On 15 April 2005, a dispute broke out between two groups of detainees at one of the compounds of the Camp Bucca theater internment facility at approximately 11 pm. The fight left one detainee dead, was confined between the detainees in one compound, and was not directed at U.S. forces. On 16 April 2005, 11 detainees escaped Camp Bucca by cutting through in the facility's exterior fence and crawling through the unfilled portion of a previously discovered escape tunnel. The compound's guards, members of the United States Air Force, were unable to see the detainees cutting through the wire due to tower location. All 11 detainees were later captured by the Iraqi police and returned to Camp Bucca. On 19 April 2005, a 51-year-old male security detainee at Camp Bucca died of natural causes. On 14 May 2005, a 30-year-old male detainee at Camp Bucca died from a heart attack. On 23 May 2005, a fuel truck collapsed the roof of an escape tunnel being dug out of Camp Bucca. On 27 July 2005, a 30-year-old male security detainee at Camp Bucca died as a result of renal failure and other organ failure due to chronic malaria. On 28 September 2005, Sergeant Steve Morin Jr. assigned to the 111th Engineer Battalion and Air Force Airman 1st Class Elizabeth N. Jacobson assigned to the 17th Security Forces Squadron stationed at Camp Bucca were killed in action when an improvised explosive device detonated near their convoy vehicle near the Iraqi town of Safwan. In October 2005, the International Committee of the Red Cross began the Family Visitation Allowance Program at Camp Bucca. The program provides monetary assistance to families of detainees held at Camp Bucca to help cover part of the traveling and hotel costs required to visit the facility. The benefits are calculated based on the distance between their home and the city of Umm Qasr. In December 2006 a similar program was initiated at Camp Shaibe, the British internment facility in Shaibah, near Al Basrah. On 5 October 2005, a 43-year-old male security detainee died of a heart attack. On 13 October 2005, eligible detainees at Camp Bucca, Abu Ghraib prison and Camp Cropper were allowed to vote in the Iraqi Constitutional Referendum. The rest of the country voted on 15 October 2005. On 23 October 2005, a 73-year-old male security detainee died of natural causes at Camp Bucca. On 25 October 2005, it was reported that Specialist Christopher T. Monroe assigned to the Military Police Battalion stationed at Camp Bucca was killed when he was struck by a vehicle operated by Erinys International while pulling security for the United States convoy which was stopped due to an Iraqi vehicle which flipped over while trying to avoid the convoy in the vicinity of Al Basrah, Iraq. In October 2007, a lawsuit was filed in Houston, Texas by the father of Specialist Monroe against the British private security firm Erinys International. In the lawsuit, Monroe's father alleges that his son actually died after he was struck by a vehicle operated by Erinys International. The lawsuit alleges Erinys personnel passed through a checkpoint where they were warned that there were more troops ahead of them but despite the warning proceeded in the dark at a high rate of speed with only parking lights on until they struck Monroe. Monroe was dismounted and standing guard near the 5-ton vehicle he was driving providing security after the convoy he was in stopped to render assistance to an Iraqi who had been involved in a car accident. The force of the accident sheared Monroe's right leg off and threw him 30‚Äì40 feet in the air. Monroe later \\"died on a Medavac helicopter en route to Shalib Airbase\\". In a statement in response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for the company stated \\"It was a very tragic accident for which Erinys and its employees have been thoroughly exonerated\\". On 5 November 2005, a 65-year-old male security detainee died of natural causes at Camp Bucca. On 12 December 2005, nearly 90 percent of all eligible security detainees in Multi-National Forces-Iraq Theater Internment Facilities participated in the democratic vote on the Iraqi National Ballot. On 23 December 2005, Camp Bucca received rocket fire from behind an area dubbed the \\"Sniper House\\"; no injuries were reported. 2006 On 1 January 2006, 3 detainees escaped Camp Bucca by cutting through the facilities exterior fence. Two of the detainees were later captured by the Iraqi police and returned to Camp Bucca. On 7 January 2006, Sergeant Nathan Field and Specialist Robert Johnson assigned to the 414th Military Police Company were killed in a non- combat vehicle accident just outside Camp Bucca. On 7 March 2006, a 36-year- old detainee died of natural causes. On 15 March 2006, Camp Bucca received rocket fire; no injuries were reported. On 26 March 2006, a 25-year-old detainee died as the result of injuries suffered in a detainee on detainee fight. 11 May 2006, detainees initiated a multiple compound riot that included the burning of their living quarters, burning a Humvee and assaults on other detainees. The reported cause of the riot was detainees being unhappy that their housing areas were searched and that a Qu'ran with Takferi writing had been placed in a clear evidence bag that the detainees presumed was a trash bag. The riot started around 7 am in compound 10. The initial incident was stopped within an hour but around 11 am the theater internment facility exploded with multiple compound riots. Multiple weapons were found during the initial search, and based on the detainees use of weapons against the guard force, multiple weapons were confiscated during additional searches initiated because of the riot. On 30 May 2006, Camp Bucca received rocket fire; no injuries were reported. On 2 June 2006, the Army opened an Iraqi-based detention center training facility at Fort Leonard Wood Missouri called Camp Charlie. This new facility is modeled after the theater internment facility at Camp Bucca. A similar facility was opened at Fort Leavenworth in August 2006. On 1 July 2006, Airman 1st Class Carl Jerome Ware Jr. of the 886th Expeditionary Security Force Squadron assigned to Camp Bucca died of non- combat related injuries. Initial reports stated that the airmen was killed by an accidental discharge of a gun being cleaned by another airman; however in February 2007, it was reported that Airman 1st Class Kyle J. Dalton, of the 15th Security Forces Squadron, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, had been charged on 30 November 2006 with one count of murder and failure to obey a lawful order in relation to the shooting. Dalton also faced a charge of assault for a separate incident that occurred on 30 June 2006 involving Ware and another airman. Dalton, who was deployed in the Middle East at the time the charges were brought, had an Article 32 hearing and was Court-martialed on 23 April 2007 at Langley Air Force Base. As part of a plea bargain deal, Dalton pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and violating a lawful general regulation by drawing or aiming a firearm when deadly force was unnecessary. Dalton was sentenced to 10 years in prison, given a dishonorable discharge, reduced in rank from Senior Airman to Airman Basic and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances. Dalton admitted to the court that he tracked Ware with his pistol in the barracks and pulled the trigger thinking the weapon was unloaded. He also admitted that he had previously aimed a loaded M-4 carbine at another airman. In July 2006, it was announced that the Army's inspector general had requested an investigation to determine if an Anti-Deficiency Act violation occurred during the building of the detention facility. The Anti-Deficiency Act provides that no one can obligate the Government to make payments for which money has not already been authorized. The inspector general's report was released to Congress on 30 January 2007 and in it concluded: \\"Army personnel associated with funding of Phases I and II construction of the Internment Facility at Camp Bucca, Iraq, did not implement sufficient controls to ensure military compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there were two ADA violations with the FY 2004 Army Operation and Maintenance Appropriation. DoD OGC (Office of General Counsel) is completing its review and expects to sign out the report to the DoD Comptroller in the second quarter of FY 2007.\\" On 12 October 2006, an Iraqi detainee died from a heart attack. The detainee had been hospitalized since 5 October after complaining of chest pains. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. On 16 October, two airmen from the 586th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron Area Security Operations team assigned to Camp Bucca suffered injuries when an improvised explosive device exploded near their Humvee in the vicinity of Safwan. Both airmen survived the attack and were later awarded the Purple Heart medal. On 19 October 2006, an Iraqi detainee died from natural causes. On 25 November 2006, American forces announced that a detainee died of natural causes. The detainee had been hospitalized since 23 November after complaining of chest pains. On 4 December 2006, American forces announced that a detainee died of natural causes. The detainee had been treated in the facility's hospital since 17 November 2006 for kidney and heart problems. Including two detainees that died the previous week at Camp Cropper, this was the fourth detainee in coalition custody to die within a two-week period. On 24 December 2006, two detainees attempted an escape from one of the U.S. Navy staffed compounds during the dense seasonal fog. One of the detainees was allegedly an I.E.D. maker.News 2007 On 17 January 2007, US Navy Petty Officer Second Class Joseph D. Alomar, a member of Navy Provisional Detainee BN 2, assigned to Camp Bucca died of non-combat related injuries. The sailor is reported to have died from a gunshot wound to the head. On 11 February 2007 Specialist Dennis L. Sellen Jr. of the 1st Battalion, 185th Infantry Regiment was accidentally shot and killed by a fellow soldier who was cleaning his weapon after a mission. The incident is currently being investigated. On 2 March 2007 Specialist Christopher D. Young, 20, of Los Angeles, Calif., died in Safwan, Iraq, of wounds sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was assigned to Company C, 3rd Battalion, 160th Infantry Regiment, California Army National Guard, San Pedro, California. On 15 March 2007 military officials announced plans to once again expand Camp Bucca and Camp Cropper. Officials stated that this increase in capacity would be necessary to handle the detainees generated from the increased security operations in Baghdad. At the time of the report, Camp Bucca's detainee population stood at 13,800. On 26 April 2007, an Iraqi detainee died from what MNF-I reports as injuries sustained during an apparent assault by other detainees. He is reported to have been the sixth detainee to have died in MNF-I TIFs as a result of detainee on detainee violence in the past year. On 9 June 2007, 6 detainees were killed, 68 wounded and one Iraqi corrections officer was wounded when a rocket struck Compound 8, in the Theater Internment Facility located at Camp Bucca. On 10 June 2007, a seventh detainee, who had been medically evacuated to Balad Air Base, died from wounds he sustained in the attack. On 23 June 2007 an eighth detainee who had been hospitalized in critical condition since the attack, died from cardiac arrest. On 21 June 2007 a security detainee died of cardiac arrest during a routine medical transfer from Camp Cropper to Camp Bucca. On 25 June 2007 a soldier assigned to the 178th Infantry was injured when the vehicle he was driving drove over a buried explosive. On 1 July 2007, a detainee died from what is being reported as natural causes while in the intensive care unit at the Theater Internment Facility hospital at Camp Bucca. On 12 July 2007, a detainee died from what is being reported as injuries suffered in an assault by other detainees. This is the second detainee in coalition forces custody to die from detainee on detainee violence within a week. On the same day, the Associated Press reported that Camp Bucca was among several sites in Iraq that had sensitive information posted on non-secure web sites. The Camp Bucca documents, posted on the web site of CH2M Hill Companies of Meridian, Colorado revealed locations of where prisoners are held, locations of fuel tanks, and the locations of security fences, guard towers and other security measures. The company has subsequently added password protection to its site. In August 2007, two separate news articles reported Camp Bucca's detainee populate stood at approximately 20,000 inmates. In October 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced it had suspended its visits to Camp Bucca due to the deteriorating security situation in the area. The ICRC visits all detention facilities in Iraq to monitor the conditions detainees are receiving and make recommendations where they perceive improvements could be made. To maintain their neutral status, they refuse coalition security when traveling in Iraq, which causes them to occasionally suspend visits when they deem conditions too hazardous for their personnel. On 31 October 2007, it was announced that Camp Bucca would be expanded once again to increase its capacity from 20,000 to 30,000 detainees. The $110 million project will be overseen by The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and would include $17.6 million retrofit of \\"13 existing compounds to add concrete pads to prevent tunneling, better segregation areas, and better shower and latrine facilities\\" as well as new housing, a waste water treatment plant, a water treatment plant and a $3.2 million brick factory for prisoner labor. On 27 Oct 2007, a Security Team was traveling from Umm Qsar when they came under attack by RPGs. One US Soldier was killed and three US military members were injured. On 20 November 2007, a security convoy operated by personnel from the 887th ESFS was traveling north of Safwaan city, Iraq from Camp Bucca was struck by an IED. On 23 November 2007, a riot originated in compound 31 and spread to compound 32. The guards were able to quell the riots and there were no casualties. 2008 On 1 January 2008, the base was attacked with rocket fire launched from the nearby city of Umm Qasr and no injuries were reported. British counter artillery returned fire as a show of force. The returned fire landed in empty desert close to Umm Qasr. USAF QRF units also responded to search the area for the personnel responsible for launching the rockets at the base. On 8 January 2008, a security convoy operated by personnel from the 887th ESFS traveling to Umm Qasr, Iraq from Camp Bucca was struck by an EFP/IED, injuring three coalition forces and a local national. On 14 February 2008, The 72nd Military Police Company arrived at Camp Bucca, They took over control of the Detainee Air Transportation Mission (DAT) from the USAF. On 24 February 2008, Camp Bucca was attacked with rocket fire that killed one Army and Air Force Exchange ServiceS employee and wounded several other civilian contractors. The rocket attack came less than a week after a convoy from Camp Bucca was attacked by an improvised explosive device. No one was seriously injured in that attack. In May, 2008, Camp Bucca's DFAC (Chow Hall) came under a late night attack by intense small arms fire. No casualties were reported. On 13 June 2008, members of the 887 ESFS, while standing down on a possible IED, came under a complex attack which included a vehicle borne IED, or VBIED. No injuries were reported. In July, 2008, Camp Bucca was attacked with indirect fire near the north berm. No casualties were reported. On 30 July 2008, members of the 586th ESFS called in 3 individuals running outside the berm to the Tomahawk Tactical Operations Center. Tomahawk disregarded the individuals as goat herders. Hours later the alarm sounded and it was discovered that three detainees escaped from the Theater Internment Facility. Members of the 586th began searching the interior and exterior of the FOB for the detainees. After nearly three 20+ hour days of tireless searches and manning extra posts and patrols, only one escapee was found, deceased outside the berm. The search was called off. In August 2008, an IED detonated on the roadway outside the north Berm. No coalition casualties were reported. In August 2008, it was announced that 6 sailors had been charged and would face courts-martial for abusing detainees at Camp Bucca. The abuse allegedly occurred on 14 May and involved beatings of two detainees and the sealing of eight detainees in a cell filled with pepper spray while the cells' ventilation was secured. The abuse apparently occurred after some detainees attacked guards, spitting on them and throwing containers filled with human waste at them. Seven other sailors received non-judicial punishment for failing to report the incidents. Two had their charges dismissed, and the remainder were reduced in rank or faced suspended punishment. In November 2008, the 6 sailors faced an article 32 hearing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville on charges of conspiracy, cruelty and maltreatment and making false official statements. Damage Controlman 2nd Class Adam M. White, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and assault and was sentenced to 89 days confinement and reduction of two pay grades. Adams claims he and other sailors participated in the beating of two detainees at the direction of Chief Aviation Structural Mechanic Tracy Necaise because the prisoners spit and threw feces at guards. Necaise's attorney blamed upper- level Navy officers for the incident because they assigned the sailors to Camp Bucca without any prior experience working in law enforcement or detention facilities. Necaise and the remaining sailors pleaded not guilty and could face trial in 2009. 2009 On 17 September 2009 Camp Bucca closed down detainee operations. The \\"Supermax\\" security row known as \\"Waterfront\\" manned by the US Navy NPDB (Naval Provisional Detainee Battalion) was in charge of the custody of the most dangerous detainees, and the last to be closed, with Compound 16 having the remaining 180 detainees either transferred to the U.S. military's Camp Cropper detention facility near Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) or to an Iraqi, Navy, and Army manned prison at Camp Taji north of Baghdad. NPDB 6 was attached to the US Army 306th Military Police Battalion, commanded by LTC Kenneth King. This was the last Navy unit to handle detainee operations in Camp Bucca. Role in the growth of ISIS Camp Bucca has been described as playing an important role in shaping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The detention of large numbers of Ba'athists and Islamists during the Iraqi insurgency provided them with the opportunity to forge alliances and learn from each other, combining the ideological fervour of the latter with the organizational skills of the former. Former Camp Bucca detainees who went on to become leaders in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant include Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of the ISIL before his death in October 2019; Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, spokesperson and senior ISL leader; Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, al-Baghdadi's deputy; Haji Bakr, who spearheaded ISIL's expansion into Syria; Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, the military leader responsible for planning the seizure of Mosul; and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another senior military leader. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, who founded the Syrian Al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, was also a Camp Bucca detainee.

The definition of an accredited investor (if any), and the consequences of being classified as such, vary between countries. Generally, accredited investors include high-net-worth individuals, banks, financial institutions and other large corporations, who have access to complex and higher-risk investments such as venture capital, hedge funds and angel investments. Laws may require that some types of financial offerings may only be made to accredited investors. Criteria for accreditation Australia s 708(8) of the Corporations Act 2001 is found in Chapter 6D (Fundraising). It defines \\"sophisticated investor\\" so as to exclude them from certain disclosure requirements. That section provides for an accountant to issue a certificate stating that an individual meets the criteria prescribed in the Corporations Regulations 2001, namely net assets of at least $2.5 million, or a gross income for each of the last two financial years of at least $250,000. There is a second definition of \\"sophisticated investor\\" in s 761GA of the Corporations Act 2001 in Chapter 7 (Financial services and markets). It defines sophisticated investors so that they can be treated as wholesale (rather than retail) clients. According to ASIC, a person with a sophisticated investor certificate is a sophisticated investor for the purpose of Chapter 6D, and a wholesale client for the purpose of Chapter 7.

He was the founder of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and the short-lived Lone Scouts of America (LSA). Born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, he acquired a love for the outdoors early in his life. After working as a schoolteacher and a coal miner, Boyce attended Wooster Academy in Ohio before moving to the Midwest and Canada. An astute businessman, Boyce successfully established several newspapers, such as The Commercial in Winnipeg, Manitoba and the Lisbon Clipper in Lisbon, North Dakota. With his first wife, Mary Jane Beacom, he moved to Chicago to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. There he established the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company and the weekly Saturday Blade, which catered to a rural audience and was distributed by thousands of newspaper boys. With his novel employment of newsboys to boost newspaper sales, Boyce's namesake publishing company maintained a circulation of 500,000 copies per week by 1894. Boyce strongly supported worker rights, as demonstrated by his businesses' support of labor unions and his concern for his newsboys' well- being. By the early years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi- millionaire and had taken a step back from his businesses to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun. Boyce learned about Scouting while passing through London during his first expedition to Africa in 1909. According to somewhat fictionalized legend, Boyce had become lost in the dense London fog, but was guided back to his destination by a young boy, who told him that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Boyce then read printed material on Scouting, and on his return to the United States, he formed the B.S.A. From its start, Boyce focused the Scouting program on teaching self- reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order \\"to make men\\". After clashing over the Scouting program with the first Chief Scout Executive James E. West, he left the B.S.A. and founded the L.S.A. in January 1915, which catered to rural boys who had limited opportunities to form a troop or a patrol. In June 1924, five years before Boyce's death, a merger was completed between the B.S.A. and the struggling L.S.A. Boyce received many awards and memorials for his efforts in the U.S. Scouting movement, including the famed \\"Silver Buffalo Award\\". Personal life and family William D. Boyce, founder of American Scouting, circa 1912 Boyce was born on June 16, 1858 in New Texas, Pennsylvania ‚Äì now Plum Borough ‚Äîto a Presbyterian farm couple, David and Margaret Jane Bratton Boyce. The Boyces had three children: William Dickson, Mary, and John. During his rural childhood, Boyce acquired a love for the outdoors. He began teaching school at the age of 16 and then worked briefly as a coal miner. He returned to teaching before joining his sister at Wooster Academy in Ohio, which‚Äîaccording to school records‚Äîhe attended from 1880 to 1881. It is uncertain if he graduated or was expelled. He then worked as a teacher, lumberjack, secretary, and salesman in the Midwest and Canada before settling in Chicago, where he quickly became known as a persuasive and shrewd salesman and learned business quickly. His books on business, travel, and expeditions often used the phrase \\"We pushed on.\\" On January 1, 1884, Boyce married Mary Jane Beacom (1865‚Äì1959), whom he had known since his Pennsylvania childhood. Boyce called her Betsy, but to many her nickname was \\"Rattlesnake Jane\\" because she matched his skill in poker, was an expert shot, and rode horses cross saddle. It had also become obvious that she was more masculine than Boyce himself, although he had never admitted this, it became clear out of his journal. They had one son and two daughters: Benjamin Stevens (1884‚Äì1928), Happy (1886‚Äì1976) and Sydney (1889‚Äì1950). Boyce's personal activities included hunting, yachting, Odd Fellows, Freemasonry, Shriners, golf, country clubs and the Chicago Hussars‚Äîan independent equestrian military organization. In 1903, Boyce purchased a four-story mansion on in Ottawa, Illinois, which became the center of his family and social activities. Thereafter, he showed little interest in Chicago and its social activities; he would only go there on business. Boyce and Mary led increasingly separate lives and eventually divorced, which was reported on the front page of the Chicago Tribune because of the prominence he had attained by that time. The divorce was finalized in a Campbell County, South Dakota court in September 1908; his wife's property settlement was close to $1 million (USD). After the divorce was finalized, Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from Oak Park, Illinois, who was 23 years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a former Lieutenant Governor of Missouri. Both Virginia's parents and Boyce's son Ben opposed the relationship. In May 1910, after the planned marriage was announced, an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce sustained a facial wound. Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs. Two days later, Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon. Almost immediately, there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers about problems within the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a daughter, whom they named Virginia. A few months later, in December 1911, Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter. After Boyce's wife filed for divorce in March 1912, she moved to Santa Barbara, California, with their daughter and her parents. Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $100,000 settlement. Years later, the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts, a New York banker, and moved with her and Boyce's daughter to Greenwich, Connecticut. The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts. She did not meet her natural father, Boyce, until she was eight years old. Ben married Miriam Patterson of Omaha, Nebraska, on June 11, 1912. Both Boyce and his first wife attended the ceremony. At this time Boyce's first wife, Mary, exchanged some of her Chicago property for the home in Ottawa, which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might reconcile. The next year they remarried on June 14, 1913, in Ottawa. They then departed on a honeymoon to Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, Panama, and Cuba, with their daughter Happy, son Ben, and his wife Miriam. Business enterprises As Boyce traveled, he often started a newspaper wherever he went. His first venture into commercial publishing was compiling a city directory. He also worked briefly for a publisher in Columbus, Ohio, and a newspaper publisher in Kensington, Pennsylvania, part of Philadelphia. He then boarded a train for Chicago and worked as a secretary and salesman for \\"Western\\" magazine. Restless again, he moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and sold advertisements for a publisher for a short time and then spent a month in Fargo, North Dakota, and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Further north in Canada, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he and local resident James W. Steen co-founded \\"The Commercial\\" in 1881, a newspaper that lasted for 70 years. He sold his share of \\"The Commercial\\" to his partner in 1882 and returned to Fargo where he became a reporter. In December 1882, Boyce moved to Lisbon, North Dakota, where he bought the Dakota Clipper. Beginning in December 1884, Boyce managed reporters and news releases at the \\"Bureau of Correspondence\\" at the six-month-long World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans, Louisiana. Countries from all over the world sent displays. Boyce was responsible for providing news stories on events and displays to over 1,200 newspapers around the country. He returned to North Dakota after the Exposition concluded, but by early 1886 he had moved back to Chicago. He often returned in North Dakota for publishing business deals and deer- and duck-hunting vacations. Newschildren, February 1910 In Chicago, he founded the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which provided advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers. In 1887, he established the weekly \\"Saturday Blade\\", an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys‚Äîan innovation at the time. By 1892, the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the \\"Saturday Blade\\" and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher Rand McNally. The success of the \\"Saturday Blade\\" spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the \\"Chicago Ledger\\", a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 he founded the international \\"Boyce's Weekly\\", which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for \\"Boyce's Weekly\\". Eight months later, \\"Boyce's Weekly\\" was consolidated with the \\"Saturday Blade.\\" Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers \\"Farm Business\\" in 1914 and \\"Home Folks Magazine\\" in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the \\"Blade\\" and \\"Ledger\\" into the monthly \\"Chicago Blade & Ledger\\", which was published until 1937. As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him gain an understanding of America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: \\"There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you.\\" and \\"whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished\\". \\"The Boyce Building\\" at 500‚Äì510 North Dearborn Street, Chicago In 1891, Boyce began working on his own 12-story office building at 30 North Dearborn Street, known as the \\"Boyce Building\\", it was designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb. Even 20 years later, this building was recognized as the most expensive building (in terms of dollars per cubic foot) in Chicago. In 1907, Boyce consolidated his business operations into another office building, also known as the Boyce Building, at 500‚Äì510 North Dearborn Street. A new four- story office building‚Äîdesigned by the architectural firm of Daniel Burnham‚Äîwas built on this location in 1912 and expanded during 1913‚Äì14 with an additional six stories. This building was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 29, 1996, maintained by the United States Department of the Interior and its National Park Service. At a time when women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed, Boyce felt their rights were important: his businesses employed many women and he supported labor unions. His newspapers often carried stories about the \\"nobility of labor\\". His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the Panic of 1893, a time when many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages. During the Pullman Strike of the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894, which spread to 20 companies in over half the states, Boyce called Eugene V. Debs, the socialist labor national leader of the American Railway Union, a \\"great labor leader\\" and industrialist George Pullman, inventor of the railroad passenger and sleeping car, the man \\"who caused all the trouble\\" (then current labor and social/political strife of the 1890s). In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in Marseilles, Illinois, burned down, he paid the workers immediately and then hired them back as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income. Yet, he was also protective of his money. In late 1894, when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $2,000 each in a court judgment, Boyce appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Illinois, and lost. He was also persistent in getting what he wanted; in 1902, he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not supplying enough water power to his mills and won a $65,300 judgment. By 1903, the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce bought the company up. Entrance to the \\"Boyce Building\\" at 500‚Äì510 North Dearborn Street, Chicago Boyce hired his son, Ben, when he was 20 years old, giving him high-level positions in his water and power businesses in and around Marseilles and Ottawa. However, their relationship was often strained by Boyce's high expectations and Ben's carelessness with his funds in activities such as betting on horse races. During June‚ÄìAugust 1906, the government proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $300 million (USD), claiming that he would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by the government, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase. Boyce was a multi-millionaire by the early 1900s and by 1909 became more interested in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes may have been in part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating. In 1914 Boyce bought two more newspapers, the \\"Indianapolis Sun\\", which he renamed the \\"Indianapolis Daily Times\\", and the \\"Inter Ocean Farmer\\", which he renamed \\"The Farming Business\\". By 1920, the majority of Americans lived in cities instead of rural areas. Lone Scout, \\"Saturday Blade\\", and \\"Chicago Ledger\\" all focused on rural customers and began to falter. Boyce launched \\"Home Folks Magazine\\" in an attempt to regain customers. By June 1925, sales had slipped so much that he merged the latter two titles into the \\"Blade and Ledger\\", which caused sales to rise again. This encouraged Boyce to start \\"Movie Romances\\", one of the first tabloid magazines about movie star romances. Boyce's success in the publishing business lay in his ability to organize the administration of a business and delegate details to subordinates. He eventually amassed a fortune of about US$20 million. Boyce's life paralleled Theodore Roosevelt's in many ways: Both men were products of the Progressive Era, internationally prominent, had concern for children, supported Scouting, were adventurers and outdoorsmen, (modern-day \\"environmentalists\\"), and were interested in civic reform. Although Boyce admired and sought to surpass Roosevelt, his only foray into politics was the 1896 Republican primary for a United States Representative (congressman) in the U.S. House of Representatives ‚Äì a bitterly fought campaign which he lost to first-term incumbent George E. Foss. In all likelihood, Boyce met Roosevelt at the Union League Club of Chicago, of which the former had become a member in 1891. His ambivalent attitude towards government was a common one of the general public during the Progressive Era. However, Boyce's Republican credentials and monetary contributions earned him an invitation to the presidential inauguration and ball of newly elected successor to \\"T.R.\\", the 27th President, William Howard Taft in March 1909. Expeditions Boyce financed an expedition of the explorer Frederick Schwatka to Alaska in 1896. Schwatka discovered gold near Nome and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers, which led him to finance other Schwatka expeditions as well as those of other adventurers, including a failed expedition to the Yukon River in 1898. Boyce soon began to carry out his own expeditions. When the United States entered the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Boyce set sail for Cuban waters aboard the ship Three Friends. The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown. In March 1909, Boyce embarked on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond were part of the expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals. In December 1910, Boyce led a nine- month, expedition to South America that was extensively reported in his newspapers. In late January 1915, Boyce sailed to England because of his concern over World War I. He received permission from the American Legation in Switzerland to travel into Germany and Austria for six weeks to report on the industrial and commercial effects of the war on those countries. He sent extensive reports to his newspapers and returned home around April‚ÄìMay. In late 1922, Boyce departed on another expedition to Africa, this time for six months. Morocco reminded him of the Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed for the first time in decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal. Scouting As Boyce's interest in philanthropy grew, he turned to his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America. Unknown Scout legend According to legend, Boyce was lost on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him back to his destination. The boy then refused Boyce's tip, explaining that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden- Powell, who was the head of the Boy Scout Association at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around American Indian lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters. In actuality, Boyce stopped in London en route to a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout headquarters and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.Letter from W. D. Boyce to James E. West (February 27, 1928) Irving, Texas: National Scouting Museum Boy Scouts of America BSA uniforms, 1917‚Äì18 The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8, 1910, but it struggled from shortages of cash and leadership in the beginning. Boyce personally donated $1,000 a month to keep the organization running on the condition that boys of all races and creeds be included, which was at odds with his own expressed belief in the superiority of whites. He was not interested in directing the organization, and turned over the running of the organization to Edgar M. Robinson of the YMCA, who proceeded to recruit the permanent executive board of the BSA. The much-needed leadership and management arrived when the Sons of Daniel Boone and Woodcraft Indians merged with the BSA. Boyce felt that Scouting's emphasis on outdoor activity was crucial in producing the type of leaders that America needed because youth reared in cities had too much done for them, whereas those from the country had to learn to do things for themselves. Scouting was focused on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order \\"to make men\\". Lone Scouts of America Plaque on the Boyce Building honoring Boyce and his founding of the Lone Scouts of America Boyce clashed with James E. West, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, over a program for boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a magazine for the BSA, as long as it was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program. As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915. Reliance on Native American themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could form small groups known as \\"tribes\\", the tribe's treasurer was known as the \\"wampum-bearer\\", and LSA taught boys to respect the environment. Boyce's annual contribution to the LSA grew to $100,000. In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts. Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting Lone Scout magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title Chief Totem. Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents. By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members. In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the Gros Ventres Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name \\"Big Cloud\\" during a three-day ceremony. With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one. Boyce felt that Lone Scout was the best magazine he had ever done. Lone Scout was so popular that it could not handle all the material that was submitted, so many local and regional Tribe Papers were started. By 1922, Boyce's newspaper business was suffering and Lone Scout was losing money‚Äîit switched from a weekly to a monthly. Boyce's racial prejudice was revealed when the racial tensions in Chicago increased in the 1920s. The LSA issued a formal proclamation in late 1920 that it would only accept whites and in 1922 changed the masthead of Lone Scout from \\"A Real Boys' Magazine\\" to \\"The White Boys Magazine\\". The fortunes of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for Lone Scout, George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: it was full of duplications and inactive members. The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number. Boyce finally accepted West's annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924. Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade, gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties. Legacy William D. Boyce, circa 1922 Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 of a heart embolism. His father did not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea. Boyce died from bronchial pneumonia on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude. A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21, 1941, which West dedicated. Grave of William D. Boyce Boyce was recognized with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, the first year it was awarded, for his efforts in starting the BSA. He was the third recipient, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. During the BSA's 50th anniversary in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and several of Boyce's descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois governor William Stratton delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, about 2,500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa, attended by his last surviving child, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member. Boyce had been a member from 1891 until he died. On December 6, 1997, a Scouting museum opened in Ottawa. The W. D. Boyce Council of the BSA is named in his honor. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, recognizes his achievements to Scouting. Not far from the marker is a county park, Boyce Park, that was named for him. A medallion of Boyce is near the White House as part of The Extra Mile ‚Äì Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. In 2005, the BSA introduced the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award, presented to the organizer of any new Scouting unit. The Extra Mile National Monument in Washington, DC selected Boyce as one of its 37 honorees. The Extra Mile pays homage to Americans like Boyce who set their own self-interest aside to help others and successfully brought positive social change to the United States.

It, along with the neighboring Como Park, has been a recreation area for residents of the Twin Cities for more than a century. It was named in 1848 by local farmer Charles Perry. A pavilion sits on the west side of the lake, and plays host to theatrical performances and concerts during the warmer months. The park features a variety of attractions, including the Como Park Zoo and Conservatory and the Como Regional Park Pool which are heavily used whenever good weather beckons people to go outside. History After James-Younger Gang member Charlie Pitts was killed in the chaotic aftermath of the disastrous September 7, 1876 Northfield, Minnesota raid, his body was boxed up and temporarily submerged in the lake by Dr. Henry Hoyt, a local physician who wanted the bleached skeleton as a display piece for his office. The skeleton was on display for unknown number of years at the Stage Coach Museum in Shakopee, Minnesota. In 1981 the remains were donated to the Northfield Historical Society. Currently the skeleton is housed in the Physical Anthropology Lab at Minnesota State University in Mankato awaiting analysis. Fish The lake contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake's bluegill, bullhead, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye due to mercury and/or PFOS contamination.

Their neighbours to the west were the Sicani. The Sicels gave Sicily the name it has held since antiquity, but they rapidly fused into the culture of Magna Graecia. History Ragusa, a Sicel town founded in the 7th century BC. Archaeological excavation has shown some Mycenean influence on Bronze Age Sicily. The earliest literary mention of Sicels is in the Odyssey. Homer also mentions Sicania, but makes no distinctions: \\"they were (from) a faraway place and a faraway people and apparently they were one and the same\\" for Homer, Robin Lane Fox notes.Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer, 2008:115; Homer's references are in Odyssey 20,383; 24.207-13, 366, 387-90. It is possible that the Sicels and the Sicani of the Iron Age had consisted of an Illyrian population who (as with the Messapians) had imposed themselves on a native, Pre-Indo-European (\\"Mediterranean\\") population. ThucydidesThe concern of Thucydides is to acquaint his Athenian audience with the cultural and historical background to Athenian invention in Sicilians affairs, beginning in 415 BC, in his book vi, sections 2.4-6. and other classical writers were aware of the traditions according to which the Sicels had once lived in Central Italy, east and even north of Rome.Servius' commentary on Aeneid VII.795; Dionysius of Halicarnassus i.9.22. Thence they were dislodged by Umbrian and Sabine tribes, and finally crossed into Sicily. Their social organization appears to have been tribal, economically and agriculturally. According to Diodorus Siculus,Diodorus Siculus V.6.3-4. after a series of conflicts with the Sicani, the river Salso was declared the boundary between their respective territories. The common assumption is that the Sicels were more recent arrivals, had introduced the use of iron into Bronze Age Sicily and brought the domesticated horse. That would date their arrival on the island to the early 1st millennium BC. However, there is some evidence that the ethnonym may predate the Iron Age, based on the name Shekelesh given to one of the Sea Peoples in the Great Karnak Inscription in the late 13th century BC. Archaeological evidence points towards their arrival on the island between the thirteenth or eleventh century BCE. The Sicel necropolis of Pantalica, near Syracuse, is the best known, and the second- largest one is the Necropolis of Cassibile, near Noto. Their elite tombs a forno, or oven-shaped, take the form of beehives. The chief Sicel towns were Agyrium (Agira); Centuripa or Centuripae (Centorbi but now once again called Centuripe); Henna (later Castrogiovanni, which is a corruption of Castrum Hennae through the Arabic Qasr-janni but, since the 1920s, once again called Enna); and three sites named Hybla: Hybla Major, called Geleatis or Gereatis, on the river Symaethus; Hybla Minor, on the east coast north of Syracuse (possibly pre-dating the Dorian colony of Hyblaean Megara); and Hybla Heraea in the south of Sicily. With the coming of Greek colonists‚Äîboth Chalcidians, who maintained good relations with the Sicels, and Dorians, who did not‚Äîand the growing influence of Greek civilization, the Sicels were forced out of most of the advantageous port sites and withdrew by degrees into the hinterland. Sixty kilometres (forty miles) from the coast of the Ionian Sea, Sicels and Greeks exceptionally lived side by side in Morgantina to the extent that historians argue whether it was a Greek polis or a Sicel city. Greek goods, especially pottery, moved along natural routes, and eventually Hellenistic influences can be observed in regularised Sicel town planning. However, in the middle of the fifth century BC a Sicel leader, Ducetius, was able to create an organised Sicel state as a unitary domain in opposition to Greek Syracusa, including several cities in the central and south of the island. After a few years of independence, his army was defeated by the Greeks at Nomae in 450 BC, and he died ten years later. Without his charisma, the movement collapsed and the increasingly Hellenized culture of the Sicels lost its distinctive character. But in the winter of 426/5 Thucydides noted the presence among the allies of Athens in the siege of Syracuse of Sicels who had \\"previously been allies of Syracuse, but had been harshly governed by the Syracusans and had now revolted\\". (Thucydides 3.103.1) Aside from Thucydides, the Greek literary sources on Sicels and other pre-Hellenic peoples of Sicily are to be found in fragmentary scattered quotes from the lost material of Hellanicus of Lesbos and Antiochus of Syracuse. There is some evidence that the Sicels had several matriarchal customs which is unattested in other Indo- European groups of the region. Language Linguistic studies have suggested that the Sicels may have spoken an Indo-European languageThe basic study is Joshua Whatmough in R.S. Conway, J. Whatmough and S.E. Johnson, The Prae- Italic Dialects of Italy (London 1933) vol. 2:431-500; a more recent study is A. Zamponi, \\"Il Siculo\\" in A.L. Prosdocimi, ed., Popoli e civilt√† dell'Italia antica, vol. 6 \\"Lingue e dialetti\\" (1978949-1012.) and occupied eastern Sicily as well as southernmost ItalyThucydides reported that there were still Siculi in Italia, which only referred approximately to the modern Calabria in his time; he derived Italia from an eponymous Italos, a Sicel king (Histories, vi.4.6), cf. Name of Italy. whereas the Sicani (Greek: Sikanoi) and Elymi (Greek Elymoi) inhabited central and western Sicily. It is likely that the two latter peoples spoke non-Indo-European languages, although this is far from certain, particularly with regard to the Elymian language, which some would consider related to Ligurian or to Anatolian, others to the other Italic languages.http://lila.sns.it/mnamon/index.php?page=Lingua&id;=59 The classification of the language of the Sicani remains uncertain. Of the Sicel language the little that is known is derived from glosses of ancient writers and from a very few inscriptions, not all of which are demonstrably Sicel.Price 1998. It is thought that the Sicels did not employ writing until they were influenced by the Greek colonists. Several Sicel inscriptions have been found to date: Mendolito (Adrano), Centuripe, Poira, Patern√≤‚ÄëCivita, Palik√© (Rocchicella di Mineo), Montagna di Ramacca, Licodia Eubea, Ragusa Ibla, Sciri Sottano, Monte Casasia, Castiglione di Ragusa, Terravecchia di Grammichele, Morgantina, Montagna di Marzo (Piazza Armerina), and Terravecchia di Cuti. The first inscription discovered, of ninety-nine Greek letters, was found on a spouted jug found in 1824 at Centuripe;Now in the Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe (Price 1998) it uses a Greek alphabet of the 6th or 5th century BC. It reads: :\\"nunustentimimarustainamiemitomestiduromnanepos duromiemtomestiveliomnedemponitantomeredesuino brtome‚Ä¶\\" There have been various attempts at interpreting it (e.g. V. Pisani 1963, G. Radke 1996) with no sure results. Another long Sicel inscription was found in Montagna di Marzo: :\\"tamuraabesakedqoiaveseurumakesagepipokedlutimbe levopomanatesemaidarnakeibureitamomiaetiurela\\" The best evidence for Sicel having been of Indo-European derivation is the verb form pibe \\"drink\\", a second-person singular present imperative active exactly cognate with Latin bibe (and Sanskrit piba, etc.). Membership in the Italic branch, perhaps even close to Latino-Faliscan, cannot be ruled out: Varro states that Sicel was strictly allied to Latin as many words sounded almost identical and had the same meaning, such as oncia, lytra, moeton (Lat. mutuum).Varro, De Lingua Latina V, 105 and 179. Religion Their characteristic cult of the Palici is influenced by Greek myth in the version that has survived, in which the local nymph Talia bore to Adranus, the volcanic god whom the Greeks identified with Hephaestus, twin sons, who were \\"twice-born (palin \\"again\\"; ikein \\"to come\\"), born first of their nymph mother, and then of the earth, because of the \\"jealousy\\" of Hera, who urged Mother Earth, Gaia, to swallow up the nymph. Then the soil parted, giving birth to the twins, who were venerated in Sicily as patrons of navigation and of agriculture. In the most archaic level of Greek mythology, a titan, Tityos, grew so large that he split his mother's womb and had to be carried to term by Gaia herself. He came to the attention of later Greek mythographers only when he attempted to waylay Leto near Delphi. If such a mytheme is set into action as ritual, it is usual to see a pair of sacrificial children laid in the earth to encourage the green growth. In the temple to Adranus, father of the Palici, the Sicels kept an eternal fire. A god Hybla (or goddess Hyblaea), after whom three towns were named, had a sanctuary at Hybla Gereatis. The connection of Demeter and Kore with Henna (the rape of Proserpine) and of the nymph Arethusa with Syracuse is due to Greek influence. Traces of the Sicels religion seems to have survived in the form of the sacred prostitution practiced in the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Mount Eryx.

The plot of the novel is unrelated to the Richard Connell short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\".  Plot  Bill Cary is a bush pilot living in Lapland in northern Finland, making a precarious living flying aerial survey flights looking for nickel deposits, and occasional charter cargo flights of dubious legitimacy in his beat-up old de Havilland Beaver. Towards the end of the flying season, a wealthy American hunter hires him to fly into a prohibited part of Finland near the Soviet border in order to hunt bear. Subsequently, he is assaulted by thugs when he refuses a charter contract to search for a lost Tsarist treasure, comes under suspicion from the Finnish police for smuggling when Tsarist-era gold sovereigns start turning up, and from the Finnish secret police for espionage. However, things get more serious when the wealthy American hunter's beautiful sister turns up to search for her brother, and his fellow bush pilots start getting killed off in a series of suspicious accidents. Cary suspects that the events he is increasingly involved in may stem from an incident in his wartime past.

It is one of three major endogenous estrogens, the others being estradiol and estrone. Levels of estriol in women who are not pregnant are almost undetectable. However, during pregnancy, estriol is synthesized in very high quantities by the placenta and is the most produced estrogen in the body by far, although circulating levels of estriol are similar to those of other estrogens due to a relatively high rate of metabolism and excretion. Relative to estradiol, both estriol and estrone have far weaker activity as estrogens. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estriol is used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy; for information on estriol as a medication, see the estriol (medication) article. Biological activity Estriol is an estrogen, specifically an agonist of the estrogen receptors ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. It is a far less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and as such is a relatively weak estrogen. According to one in vitro study, the relative binding affinity (RBA) of estriol for the human ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ was 11.3% and 17.6% of that estradiol, respectively, and the relative transactivational capacity of estriol at the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ was 10.6% and 16.6% of that of estradiol, respectively. According to another in vitro study however, the RBA of estriol for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ were 14% and 21% of those of estradiol, respectively, suggesting that unlike estradiol and estrone, estriol may have preferential affinity for ERŒ≤. Although estriol is an efficacious agonist of the ERs, it is reported to have mixed agonist‚Äìantagonist (partial agonist) activity at the ER; on its own, it is weakly estrogenic, but in the presence estradiol, it is antiestrogenic. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. It is notable that unlike estriol, estrone can be metabolized into estradiol, and most of its potency in vivo is in fact actually due to conversion into estradiol. In addition to acting as an agonist of the nuclear ERs, estriol at high concentrations (~1,000‚Äì10,000 nM) also acts as an antagonist of the GPER, a membrane estrogen receptor where, conversely, estradiol acts as an agonist. Estradiol increases breast cancer cell growth via activation of the GPER (in addition to the ER), and estriol has been found to inhibit estradiol-induced proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells through blockade of the GPER. Biochemistry Human steroidogenesis, showing estriol at bottom right. In essence, it follows the pathway from dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA (at left), but with a modified DHEA with an additional OH-group. Biosynthesis =In non-pregnant women= In women who are not pregnant estriol is produced in only very small quantities, and circulating levels are barely detectable. Unlike estradiol and estrone, estriol is not synthesized in or secreted from the ovaries, and is instead derived mainly if not exclusively from 16Œ±-hydroxylation of estradiol and estrone by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4) mainly in the liver. Estriol is cleared from the circulation rapidly in non-pregnant women, and so circulating levels are very low, but concentrations of estriol in the urine are relatively high. Although circulating levels of estriol are very low outside of pregnancy, parous women have been found to have levels of estriol that are to some degree higher than those of nulliparous women. =In pregnant women= Estriol is produced in quantities that are notable only during pregnancy. Levels of estriol increase 1,000-fold during pregnancy, whereas levels of estradiol and estrone increase 100-fold, and estriol accounts for 90% of the estrogens in the urine of pregnant women. At term, the daily production of estriol by the placenta is 35 to 45 mg, and levels in the maternal circulation are 8 to 13 ng/dL. The placenta produces pregnenolone and progesterone from circulating cholesterol. Pregnenolone is taken up by the fetal adrenal glands and converted into dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is then sulfated by steroid sulfotransferase into dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). DHEA-S is hydroxylated by high CYP3A7 expression and activity into 16Œ±-hydroxy-DHEA-S (16Œ±-OH-DHEA-S) in the fetal liver and to a limited extent in the fetal adrenal glands. 16Œ±-OH-DHEA-S is then taken up by the placenta. Due to high expression of steroid sulfatase in the placenta, 16Œ±-OH-DHEA-S is rapidly cleaved into 16Œ±-OH-DHEA. Then, 16Œ±-OH-DHEA is converted by 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (3Œ≤-HSD1) into 16Œ±-hydroxyandrostenedione (16Œ±-OH-A4) and 16Œ±-OH-A4 is converted by aromatase into 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone (16Œ±-OH-E1), which is subsequently converted into estriol by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and then secreted predominantly into the maternal circulation. Approximately 90% of precursors in estriol formation originate from the fetus. During pregnancy, 90 to 95% of estriol in the maternal circulation is conjugated in the form of estriol glucuronide and estriol sulfate, and levels of unconjugated estriol are slightly less than those of unconjugated estradiol and similar to those of unconjugated estrone. As such, target tissues are likely to be exposed to similar amounts of free estriol, estradiol, and estrone during pregnancy. Estrone and estradiol are also produced in the placenta during pregnancy. However, in the case of estrone and estradiol, DHEA-S is taken up by the placenta and cleaved by steroid sulfatase into dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA is converted by 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I into androstenedione, and androstenedione is aromatized into estrone. Then, placental 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase interconverts estrone and estradiol and the two hormones are secreted into the maternal circulation. DHEA-S that is taken up by the placenta is mainly produced by the fetal adrenal glands. Distribution Estriol is poorly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), with much lower binding affinity for this protein, relative to estradiol, and hence a greater fraction available for biological activity. Metabolism Estriol is metabolized via glucuronidation and sulfation. Excretion The main urinary metabolites of exogenous estriol administered via intravenous injection in baboons have been found to be estriol 16Œ±-glucuronide (65.8%), estriol 3-glucuronide (14.2%), estriol 3-sulfate (13.4%), and estriol 3-sulfate 16Œ±-glucuronide (5.1%). The metabolism and excretion of estriol in these animals closely resembled that which has been observed in humans. Medical use Estriol is used as a medication, primarily in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms. Chemistry Estriol, also known as 16Œ±-hydroxyestradiol or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,16Œ±,17Œ≤-triol, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds between the C1 and C2, C3 and C4, and C5 and C10 positions and hydroxyl groups at the C3, C16Œ±, and C17Œ≤ positions. The name estriol and the abbreviation E3 were derived from the chemical terms estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and triol (three hydroxyl groups). History Estriol was discovered in 1930. It was isolated and purified from the urine of pregnant women by Marrian and colleagues. Use in screening Estriol can be measured in maternal blood or urine and can be used as a marker of fetal health and well-being. If levels of unconjugated estriol (uE3 or free estriol) are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate chromosomal or congenital anomalies like Down syndrome or Edward's syndrome. It is included as part of the triple test and quadruple test for antenatal screening for fetal anomalies. Because many pathological conditions in a pregnant woman can cause deviations in estriol levels, these screenings are often seen as less definitive of fetal-placental health than a nonstress test. Conditions which can create false positives and false negatives in estriol testing for fetal distress include preeclampsia, anemia, and impaired kidney function.

His work is often noted for its simplicity and directness as well as its associations with folklore, legends and magic -- especially when linked to his native Cornwall.  Early years Launceston, where Causley was both pupil and teacher Causley was born to a couple with deep working-class roots at Launceston in Cornwall, He was educated in the local primary school (a 'National School') and secondary school (Launceston College), there -- and after his military service, at a teacher training college in Peterborough. His father died in 1924 from long- standing injuries from the First World War, when Causley was 7; he was therefore largely brought up by his widowed mother. Largely because of this, Causley had to leave school at 15 to earn money for the home, working as an office boy during his early years. He also played in a semi-professional dance band, and wrote several plays -- one of which was broadcast on the BBC West Country service before the Second World War. Career and Achievements He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1940 and served as an Ordinary Seaman Coder during the Second World War, firstly aboard the destroyer HMS Eclipse in the Atlantic, at shore bases in Gibraltar and northwest England. Later he served in the Pacific on the aircraft carrier HMS Glory, after promotion to Petty Officer Coder. Causley later wrote about his wartime experiences (and their longer-term impact on him) in his poetry, and also in a book of short stories, Hands to Dance and Skylark.Waterman, Rory (2016), Belonging and Estrangement in the Poetry of Philip Larkin, R.

The collection Survivor's Leave followed in 1953, and from then until his death Causley published frequently, in magazines, in his own volumes and shared ones, in anthologies and then in several editions of his Collected Poems. After demobilisation in 1946, he took advantage of a government scheme to train as a teacher at Peterborough. He then worked full-time as a teacher at his old school for over 35 years, teaching for his very final year at St. Catherine's CofE Primary elsewhere in the town, where the National School had been relocated. He twice spent time in Perth as a visiting Fellow at the University of Western Australia, and also worked at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Canada. Causley travelled still more widely and frequently, however, after taking early retirement in 1976 to pursue a full-time career in writing.Wendy Trewin, Obituary from The Guardian, 6 November 2003. He was much in demand at poetry readings in the United Kingdom and worldwide -- the latter travels were sometimes as part of Arts Council and British Council initiatives. He also made many television and radio appearances over the post-war period, particularly for the BBC in the West Country, and as the presenter for many years of the BBC Radio 4 series Poetry Please. An intensely private person, he was nevertheless approachable and friendly. He was corresponded with well-acquainted with such writers as Siegfried Sassoon, A. L. Rowse, Susan Hill, Jack Clemo and Ted Hughes (his closest friend) -- and a host of other figures from the literary, publishing and wider cultural spheres around the world, as well the southwest region. In addition to Causley's poetry dealing with issues of faith, folklore, memory, his wartime experience and its later impact, landscape, travel, friends and family, his poems for children were and remain very popular. He used to say that he could have lived comfortably on the fees paid for the reproduction of 'Timothy Winters': Timothy Winters comes to school With eyes as wide as a football pool, Ears like bombs and teeth like splinters: A blitz of a boy is Timothy Winters. ‚Äîfirst verse So come one angel, come on ten: Timothy Winters says \\"Amen Amen amen amen amen.\\" Timothy Winters, Lord.''

When he was 83 years old, he was made a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature: he greeted this award with the words, \\"My goodness, what an encouragement!\\" Other awards include the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 1967 and a Cholmondeley Award in 1971. In 1973/74, he was Visiting Fellow in Poetry at the University of Exeter, receiving an honorary doctorate from th on 7 July 1977.Laurence Green (2013), All Cornwall Thunders at My Door: A Biography of Charles Causley. Sheffield: The Cornovia Press, p. 173, . He was presented with the Heywood Hill Literary Prize in 2000. Between 1962 and 1966, he was a member of the Poetry Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. He was twice awarded a travelling scholarship by the Society of Authors. There was a campaign to have him appointed Poet Laureate on the death of John Betjeman, but in the end that role was given to Ted Hughes. Causley himself was not very keen on the idea. However, to the people of his home town, he became \\"the greatest poet laureate we never had\\". He was interviewed by Roy Plomley on Desert Island Discs on 1 December 1979: his music choices included five classical selections and three others, while his chosen book was Boswell's Life of Johnson. In 1982, on his 65th birthday, a book of poems was published in his honour that included contributions from Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Philip Larkin and twenty-three other poets, testifying to the respect and indeed love that the British poetry community had for him. This was followed by a fuller and more wide-ranging tribute (including some unpublished reflective essays, and reproductions of several drafts of his poem 'Immunity' from his archive at Exeter University), published in 1987 and entitled Causley at 70, . His work, influenced by both traditional folk poems, the classic literary poetry of his childhood reading and school days, and later the Modernist movement's major poets such as W. H. Auden, is nevertheless intensely original and immediately recognisable. Many consider him to be, as Betjeman was, a man working outside of the dominant trends of the poetry of his day. Causley's popularity amongst general readers and listeners, particularly among the Cornish, remains high, and also appears to be expanding. A particular piece that has gained considerable attention in recent years is the late poem 'Eden Rock', an elegiac reflection on childhood, memory, family and mortality. Its opening lines are: They are waiting for me somewhere beyond Eden Rock: My father, twenty five, in the same suit Of Genuine Irish Tweed, his terrier Jack Still trembling at his feet. The former Poet Laureate Andrew Motion has said that if he could write a line as perfect as the one which closes this poem, he would die a happy man. The full text of \\"Eden Rock\\" accompanies a recording on the Poetry Archive website of Causley himself reading it (amongst several other poems) aloud, shortly before his death in 2003. Reception According to the Norton Anthology of Children's Literature,Zipes, J., et al., eds (2005), The Norton Anthology of Children's Literature, New York & London: Norton ; p. 1253. \\"because his characteristic themes, preoccupations, and freshness of language vary little, it is often difficult to distinguish between his writings for children and those for adults. He himself declared that he did know whether a given poem was for children or adults as he was writing it, and he included his children's poetry without comment in his collected works.\\" Causley stayed true to what he called his 'guiding principle', adopted from Auden and others, that: \\"while there are some good poems which are only for adults, because they pre-suppose adult experience in their readers, there are no good poems which are only for children.\\" His close friend Ted Hughes said of Causley: > \\"Among the English poetry of the last half century, Charles Causley's could > well turn out to be the best loved and most needed.... Before I was made > Poet Laureate, I was asked to name my choice of the best poet for the job. > Without hesitation, I named Charles Causley -- this marvellously > resourceful, original poet, yet among all known poets the only one who could > be called a man of the people, in the old, best sense. A poet for whom the > title might have been invented afresh. I was pleased to hear that in an > unpublished letter, Philip Larkin thought the same and chose him too.\\"Dana > Gioia, Barrier of a Common Language: an American looks at contemporary > British poetry (2003), University of Michigan Press, ; p. 58. Perhaps because of that widespread perception of Causley as a poetic 'outsider', academia has so far paid less attention to his work than it might have done. However, the publication over recent years of a book of critical essays edited by Michael Hanke, Through the Granite Kingdom, as well as a number of dissertations about Causley's work (alone, or alongside poets such as Larkin and R. S. Thomas) suggest that this situation is changing. . Another indication of that increased attention was a one-day academic symposium Charles Causley: Influence and Legacy , which took place at Falmouth University's Penryn Campus on Saturday 6 December 2014. It included some ten papers or presentations organised under three themes ('Friendship, Faith and Childhood', 'Causley in the Wider World' and 'Influence and Legacy'), as well as a discussion of a documentary film on Causley which was in the process of being completed at the time, and from which extracts were shown. The Symposium itself ended with readings from the then-current Causley Trust Writer-in- Residence at Cyprus Well, Alyson Hallett, and students who attended associated writing workshops. The day as whole was rounded off by an evening reading from the poet Brian Patten. Legacy Causley's grave in St. Thomas Churchyard in Launceston, Cornwall, is barely 100 yards from where he was born. The Charles Causley Trust, a registered charity, exists to celebrate his life and work and promote new literature activity in the community and region in which he lived. In 2006, the Trust secured Cyprus Well, the poet's small house in Launceston, for the nation. After considerable repairs, refurbishment and upgrading, that has been opened on a limited basis to the public, and to provide a facility for a varied programme of activities. Most particularly, there has been a series of residencies for writers of all kinds, artists and musicians, as well as other heritage events. These promote both Causley's life and work, and the arts in general -- especially across the South West region of Cornwall and Devon. In June 2010, the first of a continuing series of annual Charles Causley Festivals took place in Launceston, held over a long weekend. Festival programmes encompass literature, music, art and a variety of other fields for adults, families and children, featuring performers and other contributors from the local area, the region, the whole of the UK, and even world-wide. Subsequently, Festivals have taken place in and around the town for varying periods of up to a full week or more. Over the years, poets such as Sir Andrew Motion (former Poet Laureate, and patron of the Causley Trust), Carol Ann Duffy, Brian Patten and Lemn Sissay, novelists like Patrick Gale, journalists such as George Alagiah, and illustrators like John Lawrence have been headliners. There have also been events with historians, academics and even scientists like Professor James Lovelock (of Gaia Theory fame, and who lives in the district). Music at the Festival has included regular appearances from Causley's distant relative, folk singer Jim Causley. featuring his settings of Causley poems, some of which have been recorded for commercial CDs. One of these was actually made in (and entitled) 'Cyprus Well', Causley's home of many years in Launceston, and using Causley's own piano there. Many other musicians and groups have featured, too: The Fisherman's Friends, Cahal Dallat, and Seth Lakeman. The fifth festival in June 2014 was prefaced by the unveiling of a memorial plaque at Cyprus Well (another one later marked his nearby birthplace near St. Thomas Church and the River Kensey). That Festival also marked the centenary of the start of the First World War with a series of talks on war poetry. A documentary film about Causley's life and work, made by Jane Darke and Andrew Tebbs of Boatshed Films, featured in several versions across the 6th and 7th Festivals (2015 and 2016). A shortened version of the full 90' film, The Poet: Charles Causley, was broadcast on BBC4 as Charles Causley: Cornwall's Native Poet on 1 October 2017. The June 2017 Festival (the 8th) marked the centenary of Causley's birth in August 1917. There were rare performances of several of Causley's one-act plays from the 1930s, and a session from the eminent illustrator John Lawrence and Gaby Morgan marking the re-issue of Causley's Collected Poems for Children. 2018's Festival (the 9th) was headlined by poet and broadcaster Roger McGough, while the 10th Festival in June 2019 showcased events with the Devon folk artist Seth Lakeman, the novelist Patrick Gale, the artist Kurt Jackson, and the poets Alyson Hallett and Penelope Shuttle, amongst many others. The 2020 Festival which had already been planned to move from its usual late May/early June period in the calendar to late July, was heavily affected by the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. However, instead of being completely abandoned for the year (as happened with other festivals and events of many kinds), the decision was taken to make it an entirely digital Festival, with the usual wide range of events across a long weekend. Most of these (talks, performances and so on) were pre-recorded and entirely free to view through the Zoom videoconferencing platform, while a few were live, paid-for workshops. That innovative approach produced a total 'virtual' audience which was as big, if not in fact a little bigger, as the traditional 'local' formats of the preceding 10 years of Causley Festivals. Some of the audience joined from across the UK, the US, European countries, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In terms of Causley's musical legacy, an original opera by Steven McNeff based on Causley's libretto 'The Burning Boy', was premiered by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra's Kokoro Ensemble in Launceston and St. Ives in November 2017. The majority of the songs of Alex Atterson (1931‚Äì1996) are settings of Causley poems.Woods, Fred (1979), Folk Revival. Poole, Dorset: Blandford; p. 118. A number of other settings have been made of Causley poems over many years, by musicians such as Jim Causley (see above), Natalie Merchant, Johnny Coppin, Mervyn Horder and Phyllis Tate. New versions continue to be composed and performed. An art exhibition entitled 'Charles Causley: A Tribute from the Artists' was organised to coincide with Causley's 70th birthday in 1987 by Dr. Ron Tamplin of Exeter University, and featured a wide range of paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures. It later transferred from the University to the Institute of Education in Russell Square, London, for a period; an illustrated catalogue was published. Charles Causley International Poetry Competitions The Charles Causley International Poetry Prize is administered by the Causley Trust and is open to anyone over the age of 18. It began in 2013 and has continued in most years since, with a steadily-increasing number of entries. There are a number of monetary prizes and a good deal of publicity for the prize-winning poets and those achieving honourable mentions. After its early years, it developed into an international competition. In 2018, the announcements and presentations were hosted by Paul Tyler, Lord Linkinhorne (a Patron of the Causley Trust), at the House of Lords. Here is a list of the competition winners and judges to date.  2013  1st prize ‚Äì Jo Bell, ‚ÄòThe Icicle Garden‚Äô.

He has been the President of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) since 2002 and is widely known as \\"Cadogo\\". He resigned as prime minister on 10 February 2012 to run in the presidential election triggered by President Malam Bacai Sanh√°'s death on 9 January. Background Gomes was born in Bolama. He was a delegate to PAIGC's Fifth Congress in December 1991, and in the first multiparty elections, held in 1994, he was elected to the National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau from the 26th Electoral District. In 1996, he was elected First Vice-President of the National People's Assembly, Second Secretary of the Interparliamentary Committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and Vice-President of the Interparliamentary Committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. In the National People's Assembly, he also served as Chairman of the Committee for Economic Affairs and President of the Administrative Council. At PAIGC's Sixth Congress in May 1998, Gomes was elected to the party's Political Bureau, and at the party's Third Extraordinary Congress in September 1999 he was re- elected to the Political Bureau and also became the party's Secretary for Foreign Relations and International Cooperation. Gomes was elected as President of PAIGC at the Fourth Extraordinary Congress in January‚ÄìFebruary 2002. He is a banker and businessman, reputed to be the richest man in Guinea- Bissau. PAIGC won the most seats in the March 2004 parliamentary election, and Gomes became Prime Minister in May. Political life Prior to the victory of former president Vieira in the mid-2005 presidential election, Gomes said that he would resign if Vieira was elected, referring to the latter as a \\"bandit and mercenary who betrayed his own people\\".\\"Kumba Yala to back Nino Vieira in second round of presidential election\\", IRIN, July 4, 2005. After Vieira's election, Gomes initially refused to recognize the result, but he also moved away from his earlier threat to resign.\\"Prime minister says doesn't recognise new president but won't resign\\", IRIN, August 23, 2005. Vieira took office on 1 October 2005, and almost two weeks later he and Gomes had a meeting, with Gomes anticipating that the two would be able to work together.\\"President, prime minister try to iron out tension, avert crisis\\" , IRIN, October 13, 2005. However, on 28 October Vieira announced the dissolution of Gomes's government, and a long-time ally of Vieira, Aristides Gomes, was appointed Prime Minister on 2 November 2005.\\"President appoints controversial new prime minister\\", IRIN, November 2, 2005. Following the assassination of former navy commander Mohamed Lamine Sanha in early January 2007, Gomes accused Vieira of involvement in the killing in an interview with Lusa on January 8. A warrant was issued for Gomes's arrest on January 10, and when police tried to arrest him later that day he fled and took refuge in the United Nations building in Bissau. A spokesman for Gomes said that it would be unconstitutional to arrest him because he enjoyed immunity as a member of the National People's Assembly.\\"Former prime minister of Guinea-Bissau seeks asylum at U.N.\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), January 10, 2007.

Gomes left the UN building on January 29, after the arrest warrant was dropped.\\"Former Guinea-Bissau prime minister quits U.N. protection after 19 days\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), January 29, 2007. According to Gomes, he was misquoted in the interview that led to the arrest warrant. An investigating judge said that Gomes had not provided any proof for his claim of Vieira's involvement, and on December 20, 2007 it was announced that Gomes had been charged with false testimony and slandering the head of state.\\"Bissau accuses former premier of slander\\", Reuters (IOL), December 21, 2007.

Following the election, Vieira appointed Gomes as Prime Minister on December 25, 2008. Gomes said on this occasion that his government would focus on \\"good governance and a reform of the justice system\\" and that he and Vieira would \\"put aside any personal differences\\" in order to work towards solving the country's problems. He was sworn in on January 2, 2009. 2010 military unrest Following the failure of a coup plot in 2008, Rear Admiral Bubo Na Tchuto escaped to Gambia where he was arrested. Subsequently he clandestinely returned to Guinea-Bissau where he took refuge at a UN compound. The UN agreed to turn him over to the government. Nevertheless, He continued to stay in the compound. On April 1, 2010, soldiers went to the UN office. Bubo Na Tchuto voluntarily left with them. On The same day, soldiers invaded Prime Minister Gomes‚Äô residence and held him there. Simultaneously, forty military officers, including the head of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces, were held at an army base. Hundreds of the PM's supporters demanded his release. In response the deputy army chief, Antonio Ndjai, said: \\"If the people continue to go out into the streets to show their support for Carlos Gomes Junior, then I will kill Carlos Gomes Junior ... or I will send someone to kill him.\\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/04/20104112510170361.html 2012 election and coup He resigned as prime minister on 10 February 2012 in order to run in the presidential election.\\"Guinea Bissau names female interim PM\\", Agence France-Presse, 10 February 2012.

Prior to the a second round, a coup against the civilian government resulted in a military takeover of the capital, Bissau, amid reports that he was killed. However, Gomes and President Raimundo Pereira were arrested by the military as gunfire ensued in the capital of Bissau. The Chairperson of the African Union Jean Ping issued a statement rejecting the coup and demanded the release of Pereira and Gomes. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement saying that they \\"strongly condemn the forcible seizure of power\\". On 27 April, the deposed leaders were freed and sent to the Ivory Coast.

It can also be an artist or a band temporarily switching to a different style. Usually these projects emphasize a different aspect of that person's or that band's musical interests that they feel they cannot explore within the boundaries established by their main project. Side projects can later become full-time endeavours, but should not be confused with quitting a band for a solo career or another band. Peter Hartlaub of San Francisco Chronicle called the solo side project \\"the biggest longshot bet in mainstream music\\". The New York Times described the side project as \\"a break from the other band members, a chance to toy with different genres and recording methods, a fling with no long-term commitment\\". There can be aesthetic reasons to pursue side projects, and side projects can have the benefit of protecting indie credibility. Overview One example of musical side projects is Kiss's decision in 1978 to have each member of the band, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, simultaneously release solo albums. In 1992, The Melvins released solo EPs in a similar fashion. \\"Side project\\" may also refer to pursuits of famous individuals outside of their primary fields. For instance, Wicked Wisdom is a \\"side project\\" of actress Jada Pinkett Smith. Side projects often occur at a crossroads of a celebrity's career. A side project can also be a band that takes on an \\"alter ego\\", usually in order to play a different style of music that their fans are not used to. An example of this type of side project would be the band Weezer, who is also the Nirvana cover band Goat Punishment. Another example of a side project is when in 1990, Jesper Str√∂mblad of Ceremonial Oath decided to start a side project known as In Flames because he wanted to start a new project that combined Iron Maiden and death metal all together which he said he had never heard of before, the side project then grew into a band in 1995 and is now one of the most influential metal bands of all time, and still together without Jesper. A joint side project consisting of members of multiple known bands is known as a supergroup.

League history  Founding  The ECL was founded in 1923 when the Philadelphia-area Hilldale Club and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, both associate members of the midwest-based Negro National League (NNL), broke with the NNL and allied with the white promoter Nat Strong to form an east coast league. The charter members were: Hilldale, the Bacharach Giants, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Cuban Stars (East), the Lincoln Giants of New York, and the Baltimore Black Sox. In 1924 the Harrisburg Giants and Washington Potomacs joined, bringing the circuit to eight clubs. The ECL raided the NNL for players, including Hall of Famers Oscar Charleston, Biz Mackey, and John Henry Lloyd, starting a war that lasted for two years. In 1925 the Washington Potomacs moved to Wilmington, Delaware, but still disbanded in July. Their 1926 replacement, the Newark Stars, folded after only 11 games.  Uneasy peace  At the end of the 1924 season the two leagues made peace and arranged for a Colored World Series between their champions. This series was played each year from 1924 through 1927. The only ECL club to win the World Series was Hilldale in 1925.  Demise  Beginning in 1927 the league was wracked by dissension between club owners. New York's Lincoln Giants dropped out for that season. They returned the next, but then Hilldale, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, and the Harrisburg Giants all dropped out. The Philadelphia Tigers were recruited to bring the league up to five teams for 1928. The ECL staggered through May, but finally disbanded in the midst of disputes over player contracts at the beginning of June.

League history   Founding  Rube Foster, 1924, NNL League President Led by Rube Foster, owner and manager of the Chicago American Giants, the NNL was established on February 13, 1920 by a coalition of team owners at a meeting in a Kansas City YMCA. The new league was the first African-American baseball circuit to achieve stability and last more than one season. At first the league operated mainly in midwestern cities, ranging from Kansas City in the west to Pittsburgh in the east; in 1924 it expanded into the south, adding franchises in Birmingham and Memphis.  Competition  The two most important east coast clubs, the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, were affiliated with the NNL as associate clubs from 1920 to 1922, but did not compete for the championship. In 1923 they and four other eastern teams formed the Eastern Colored League (ECL) and raided the NNL for many of its top players, including John Henry Lloyd, Biz Mackey, George Scales, George Carr, and Clint Thomas, and signing Oscar Charleston, and Reuben Currie in 1924. The war between the two leagues came to an end in 1924, when they agreed to respect each other's contracts and arranged for the Colored World Series between their champions.  Difficulties and demise  The NNL survived controversies over umpiring, scheduling, and what some perceived as league president Rube Foster's disproportionate influence and favoritism toward his own team. It also outlasted Foster's decline into mental illness in 1926, and its eastern rival, the ECL, which folded in early 1928. The NNL finally fell apart in 1931 under the economic stress of the Great Depression.  Legacy  The Negro American League, founded in 1937 and including several of the same teams that played in the original Negro National League, would eventually carry on as the western circuit of black baseball. A separate Negro National League was organized in 1933, but eventually became concentrated on the east coast. To distinguish between the two unrelated leagues, they are usually referred to as the first Negro National League (or NNL I) and the second Negro National League (or NNL II).

League fell apart before season end.  League champions   Pennant winners  From 1920 through 1924, the team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The \\"games behind\\" method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. *1920 ‚Äì Chicago American Giants *1921 ‚Äì Chicago American Giants *1922 ‚Äì Chicago American Giants *1923 ‚Äì Kansas City Monarchs *1924 ‚Äì Kansas City Monarchs‚Ä° *1925 ‚Äì Kansas City Monarchs‚Ä†‚Ä° *1926 ‚Äì Chicago American Giants‚Ä†‚Ä° *1927 ‚Äì Chicago American Giants‚Ä†‚Ä° *1928 ‚Äì St. Louis Stars‚Ä† *1929 ‚Äì Kansas City Monarchs‚Ä† *1930 ‚Äì St. Louis Stars‚Ä† *1931 ‚Äì St. Louis Stars‚Ä† (season did not finish; Stars had best record among league members and were declared the champions,http://www.nlbpa.com/st__louis_stars.html though non-member Pittsburgh Crawfords disputed title) ‚Ä† ‚Äì Pennant was decided via a split- season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season, unless one team won both halves. ‚Ä° ‚Äì Pennant winner went on to play in the Colored World Series.

(2008) The Stoics Reader: Selected Writings and Testimonia. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing, p. 6 Der Tod des Dichters Pietro Aretino (The Death of the Poet Pietro Aretino) by Anselm Feuerbach. Death from laughter is a rare form of death, usually resulting from either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation, that has itself been caused by a fit of laughter. Instances of death by laughter have been recorded from the times of ancient Greece to modern times.  Pathophysiology  Death may result from several pathologies that deviate from benign laughter. Infarction of the pons and medulla oblongata in the brain may cause pathological laughter. Laughter can cause atonia and collapse (\\"agelastic syncope\\"), which in turn can cause trauma. See also laughter-induced syncope, cataplexy, and Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Gelastic seizures can be due to focal lesions to the hypothalamus. Depending upon the size of the lesion, the emotional lability may be a sign of an acute condition, and not itself the cause of the fatality. Gelastic syncope has also been associated with the cerebellum.  Notable cases *Zeuxis, a 5th-century BC Greek painter, is said to have died laughing at the humorous way in which he painted the goddess Aphrodite ‚Äì after the old woman who commissioned it insisted on modeling for the portrait. * One ancient account of the death of Chrysippus, the 3rd-century BC Greek Stoic philosopher, tells that he died of laughter after he saw a donkey eating his figs; he told a slave to give the donkey neat wine with which to wash them down, and then, \\"having laughed too much, he died\\" (Diogenes La√´rtius 7.185). * In 1410, King Martin of Aragon died from a combination of indigestion and uncontrollable laughter triggered by a joke told by his favourite court jester. * In 1556, Pietro Aretino \\"is said to have died of suffocation from laughing too much\\".Waterfield, Gordon, ed. First Footsteps in East Africa, (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1966) p. 59 footnote. * In 1660, Thomas Urquhart, the Scottish aristocrat, polymath, and first translator of Fran√ßois Rabelais's writings into English, is said to have died laughing upon hearing that Charles II had taken the throne. * In 1799, William Cushing, a pauper who lived in the parish of St Andrew's, Norwich, England, died from \\"a fit of excessive laughter, which lasted five minutes.\\" * On October 14, 1920, 56-year-old Arthur Cobcroft, a dog trainer from Loftus Street, Leichhardt, Australia, was reading a five-year-old newspaper and was amused at the prices for some commodities in 1915 as compared to 1920. He made a remark to his wife regarding this, and burst into laughter, and in the midst of it he collapsed and died. A doctor named Nixon was called in, and stated that the death was due to heart failure, brought by excessive laughter.Laughter causes death, The Argus (October 18, 1920)Died of Laughter, The Register (October 18, 1920)Death Follows Laughter., Mudgee Guardian and North-Western Representative (October 21, 1920)Died Laughing., The Sydney Stock and Station Journal (October 22, 1920) * On March 24, 1975, Alex Mitchell, from King's Lynn, England, died laughing while watching the \\"Kung Fu Kapers\\" episode of The Goodies, featuring a kilt-clad Scotsman with his bagpipes battling a master of the Lancastrian martial art \\"Eckythump\\", who was armed with a black pudding. After 25 minutes of continuous laughter, Mitchell finally slumped on the sofa and died from heart failure. His widow later sent The Goodies a letter thanking them for making Mitchell's final moments of life so pleasant. Diagnosis of his granddaughter in 2012 of having the inheritable long QT syndrome (a heart rhythm abnormality) suggests that Mitchell may have died of a cardiac arrest caused by the same condition.

League champions   Pennant winners  From 1937 and 1938, 1940, and 1942 through 1946, the team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The \\"games behind\\" method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. *1933 ‚Äì Cole's Chicago American Giants (first half), Pittsburgh Crawfords (second half with better overall)‚Ä† *1934 ‚Äì Philadelphia Stars‚Ä† won best half of season however Crawfords with better whole season record disputed title. *1935 ‚Äì Pittsburgh Crawfords‚Ä† *1936 ‚Äì Pittsburgh Crawfords‚Ä† *1937 ‚Äì Homestead Grays *1938 ‚Äì Homestead Grays *1939 ‚Äì Baltimore Elite Giants* *1940 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays *1941 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays‚Ä† *1942 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays‚Ä° *1943 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays‚Ä° *1944 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays‚Ä° *1945 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays‚Ä° *1946 ‚Äì Newark Eagles‚Ä° *1947 ‚Äì New York Cubans‚Ä†‚Ä° *1948 ‚Äì Washington Homestead Grays‚Ä†‚Ä° ‚Ä† ‚Äì Pennant was decided via a split-season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season. * ‚Äì Pennant was decided via a 2-round play-off between the top four teams. ‚Ä° ‚Äì Pennant winner went on to play in the Negro World Series.

In every incarnation of the TMNT franchise, he is depicted as the leader of the criminal organization known as the Foot Clan, and serves as the main antagonist and archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter. In 2009, The Shredder was ranked as IGN's 39th-greatest comic book villain of all time. Design Shredder's physical appearance remains fairly consistent in most incarnations of the character. Saki is a muscular Japanese man, most frequently seen in \\"the Shredder\\" persona, wearing a suit of armor vaguely based on that of a samurai, sometimes with a cape. The armor consists of blade-covered metal plaques on his shoulders, forearms, hands (sometimes just his left hand, because he is left-handed), and shins; he wears a purple, gray, blue, or red robe that variously appears to be simple fabric or a form of chain mail. He also tends to wear a metal helmet with a trident-shaped ornament on top, and a metal ninja style mask which covers his face, leaving only his eyes visible. In the 2003 TMNT series, the Shredder is a red alien Utrom named Ch'rell, who utilized an indestructible exo-suit to disguise himself as a human named Oroku Saki. Kevin Eastman got the idea for Shredder's armor from large trapezoidal cheese graters which he envisioned on a villainous character's (originally named \\"The Grater\\" or \\"Grate Man\\") arms. He then said, \\"Could you imagine a character with weapons on his arms like this?\\" Peter Laird suggested the name The Shredder.The Making of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles': Behind the Shells. 1991. Although Shredder is often depicted as the main antagonist in the Ninja Turtles franchise, it was never the creators' intention to be the case in his original inception in the Mirage Comics: Comic books Mirage and Image =Oroku Saki= In the original comic books from Mirage Comics, Oroku Saki is the younger brother of Oroku Nagi who had been killed by a fellow ninja Hamato Yoshi (the owner of Splinter, the Turtles' mentor) in a feud over a woman named Tang Shen resulting in Yoshi fleeing with Shen to the United States. Angry at the death of his older brother, Saki joined the Foot Clan and trained to be a ninja. He quickly became one of their deadliest warriors and rose up the ranks and was chosen to lead the Foot's American branch. Operating in New York under the name of The Shredder, Saki used the opportunity to avenge his brother by killing Yoshi and Shen. Under Saki's leadership, the Foot participated in variety of criminal activities, including drug smuggling, arms running, and assassination. Thirteen years later Saki was challenged by the Ninja Turtles, who were the result of an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi's pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Saki seemed to be winning, Leonardo managed to plunge his sword through Saki's torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit seppuku (ritual suicide), but Shredder refused and detonated a thermite grenade, in an attempt to take their lives alongside his own. But at the last second, Donatello used his bo to knock Shredder off the building to his death. However, it was not yet the end of the Shredder. He returned on Christmas Eve seemingly resurrected with an army of Foot Ninjas severely beating Leonardo and burning down the apartment of the turtles' ally April O'Neil, forcing them to go into hiding outside the city. A year later, in the story \\"Return to New York\\", the Turtles returned to settle the score with the Shredder. Leonardo faced off against Oroku Saki alone, during which Saki revealed he was brought back to life by a technique using worms feeding on his remains and recreating his cells to reform his body. In the battle, Leonardo decapitates the villain, finally killing him, and the four turtles burn his body at the Hudson River. = Tales of the TMNT = In the second volume of the anthology series Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles story \\"Worms of Madness\\" it is shown that a few weeks after the events of their final battle the Shredder had yet another resurrection of sorts when a Foot mystic reactivated the worms; however, the mystic did not resurrect Saki himself but the worm colony which had gained sentience and retained Saki's memories and believing itself to be Saki. The worms then went out to find a new body and chose that of a shark. After the Foot Kidnapped Splinter, the turtles managed to engage the \\"Shredder-Shark\\" in battle, defeating it by severing its connection to the mystic at which point the creature realized that it was not the real Saki. The \\"Shredder-Shark\\" returned once more kidnapping Casey's adopted daughter Shadow to lure the Turtles into a trap. With the Turtles away, it was up to Casey and Splinter to defeat it and rescue Shadow, finally killing the creature. =Other versions of the Shredder= Throughout a considerable part of the Image comic series, Raphael tries to impersonate Shredder by wearing his armor. Following this, he is accepted as the leader of the Foot Clan. In later issues of the series, a mysterious Lady Shredder appears to challenge Raphael. Although the book was canceled before her identity could be revealed, writer Gary Carlson confirmed after the fact that she was meant to be Karai. The female ninja Pimiko from series claims to be Shredder's daughter. In Volume Four series, Leonardo encounters Oroku Yoshi, a Battle Nexus contestant wearing armor almost identical to that of the second animated series' Shredder. His connection to Oroku Saki and the Foot is not known, since the bi-monthly comic was ultimately cancelled in 2010. In issue 32 he was called to meet a mysterious individual who asks to bring Leo with him as well. Archie Comics The Archie Comics' series use the same background as the 1987 cartoon, as the first issues are identical. Later in the Archie comics, Shredder travels to the future and works with Armaggon and Verminator X to offset the skill and experience of the future versions of the Turtles. This version of the character was more in line with the early episodes' depiction of the character as a cunning adversary and in many issues nearly proves to be a lethal enemy, coming close to defeating the turtles on a number of occasions, and even aids Armaggon and Verminator X in the defeat and capture of two of the turtles in the future. However he shows some amount of honour in the comic.His final fate within the Archie comics series remains unknown, though a three-part mini-series put out by Archie comics after the end of their regular comic series seems to indicate he remains a consistent foe to the turtles for many years, briefly restoring Splinter to the form of Hamato Yoshi and also undoing Michaelangelo's mutation, though both later revert to mutant status by the end of the story, while Shredder was left in a vegetative state in the aftermath of his final battle with the Turtles. IDW Publishing In feudal Japan, Oroku Saki was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan along with Hamato Yoshi. While Yoshi focused on his family, Saki surpassed him and was promoted to Jonin (leader) of the Foot. After an argument on his style of leadership, Saki sent ninja to murder Yoshi's wife, Tang Shen, and later Yoshi and his four sons. With the help of Kitsune, Saki steals regenerative ooze from an Utrom known as \\"The Iron Demon\\" (later revealed to be Krang himself) which is used to preserve his body until he is awakened by his descendant Oroku Karai several centuries later in modern-day New York. During his time in stasis, his spirit conquered the realm of the Afterlife, where he learned he was destined to rule the earth world and eventually return to the Afterlife as a lost soul. Knowing the future, he vows to change it by conquering the realm of the Afterlife upon his return. Shredder first appears in Micro-series #1 and in full costume on the final page of issue #9. Dan Duncan first designed Shredder with input from Mateus Santolouco and Kevin Eastman; originally wanting to depict a \\"beefy...monster\\" he decided to simplify the design and slimmed down the character based on the original Mirage design. Seeking control in his forthcoming battle for power, Shredder offers Splinter a place in his army but Splinter refuses, revealing himself to be a reincarnated Hamato Yoshi. Saki then reveals his own identity and attacks Splinter, almost killing him when the Turtles arrive to rescue their father. Impressed by Leonardo, he orders his capture and conducts a plan involving kidnapping and stabbing Casey Jones. Shredder then has Kitsune brainwash Leonardo to become his new Chunin (second-in-command) and uses him for a show of strength to the criminal underworld. After the Turtles rescue Leonardo, Shredder calls a meeting with Krang and proposes an alliance in exchange for Utrom technologies, which Krang rejects. A short battle results in retreat on both sides and the revelation that Shredder had stolen some Utrom resources from Krang's compound to begin creating a mutant army (in the form of Bebop, Rocksteady, Koya and Bludgeon). In Issue #50, Shredder faced Splinter and the turtles in a final battle which he lost and briefly admitted his faults and also making Karai the new head of the Foot Clan. He was then killed by Splinter by having his sword slashed into the back of his head, killing him instantly. After his death, Shredder's body is kept in a crypt that is guarded by Jennika who was assigned by Hamato Yoshi in order to learn humility. Shredder's tomb is eventually desecrated by the witch Kitsune who plans to revive Oroku Saki in order to restore order to the Foot Clan but Splinter knew this and keeps the skull to foil her attempts. Shredder will appear in the upcoming miniseries Shredder in Hell. In the mini-series Shredder is in the afterlife and descends into the underworld trying to find the truth of his own soul meanwhile Kitsune uses his corpse to summon her father as his host. Shredder also fought his past life Takeshi Tasuo in his inner conflict until Splinter/Hamato Yoshi later shows up to help him against the forces of Hell. Television 1987 animated series Shredder in the 1987 animated series In the 1987 animated series, Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were both members of the Foot Clan in Japan. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting sensei, Yoshi was forced to exile himself to New York City, where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain. In the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan, and took on his Shredder persona. He also met a trans-dimensional alien called Krang, and used the advanced technology at his disposal to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. He secretly moved to New York, where he found Yoshi still alive. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. This mutates Yoshi into Splinter, and he starts training the also mutated Turtles in ninjutsu. After the Turtles discovered his operation in New York City, Shredder became their enemy and would stop at nothing until they were defeated. In one episode, Shredder was accidentally hit by his lasted weapon that made him think he was pals with the Turtles as he thought he was Michelangelo. However, Shredder was hypnotized by Splinter into going between his real personality and Michelangelo whenever he would hear their names. Although, after being hit again, Shredder was back to his old self, which might off undid the hypnosis. Shredder was voiced by James Avery for seasons one to seven and William E. Martin for seasons eight and ten, with the alternates being Dorian Harewood and Pat Fraley in 1989, Jim Cummings in 1991‚Äì1993 and Townsend Coleman in 1993. In the 2009 crossover movie Turtles Forever, this incarnation of the Shredder was voiced by Load Williams. In the 2012 series, the 1987 version of the Shredder is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson due to the death of James Avery in 2013. =Depiction= In his early appearances, Shredder was presented as extremely cunning and was described by Splinter himself as the most dangerous adversary he ever faced. Shredder's intelligence persevered throughout his various portrayals, and in several instances, it is claimed that Shredder has an IQ of 300. As the 1987 cartoon series was more light- hearted than the comics, Shredder was later depicted as evil but a villain that always fails rather than the dire and lethal ninja he was originally shown to be. He and Krang are constantly bickering about tactics and often take pleasure in the other's failings (and sometimes intentionally sabotage each other). His two henchmen Bebop and Rocksteady are especially incompetent and fail miserably at everything they do. They were mostly used for comic relief in the show; however, the Turtles certainly consider them to be formidable (despite their inane stupidity) in combat due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them. Despite Shredder's failings, he is still shown to have considerable skills. In martial arts, he is often shown to surpass the Turtles and to be equaled only by Splinter. Nevertheless, he usually runs away from a fight when outnumbered, incapacitating the Turtles to defeat them in combat; as the series progressed, however, the Turtles were able to battle him on more equal grounds and even defeat him in combat on several occasions. He trained the Punk Frogs in a very short period of time to be a match for the Turtles, but the Punk Frogs soon switch sides. His technical skills are also quite impressive: he designed and built a robotic body for Krang, prepared the mutagen mixture, knew how Krang's teleportation engine worked, and built numerous other advanced devices. Ironically in one episode \\"Shredderville\\" the Turtles dream they find themselves in a mirror universe where the TMNT never existed and Shredder rules New York City, yet finds the task of ruling so burdensome that he has a nervous breakdown. From mid season seven onwards, Shredder was depicted as a more serious threat, full of anger and bloodlust, though he was still easily defeated by the Turtles. His friendship with Krang also appeared to have grown. There were many times that Shredder could have just left Krang at the mercy of the Turtles or Lord Dregg, but he always rescued him, and went as far as to donate his life energy to save him. =Family= Shredder's family is presented in three episodes. In the episode \\"Shredder's Mom\\", Shredder's mother Miyoko helps Shredder and Krang in an attempt to destroy the world's climate. In this episode, Miyoko first learns of her son's criminal activities, and proves herself to be as villainous. However, she constantly treats Shredder like a baby, until he gets fed up with it and transports her back to her retirement home. In the episode \\"My Brother, the Bad Guy\\", it is revealed that Oroku Saki has a younger brother, Kazuo who works as a police lieutenant in Tokyo. Kazuo and the Turtles try to join forces to stop one of Shredder's plans, but his fervent respect of the law clashes with the Turtles' \\"whatever it takes\\" attitude. Finally, the episode \\"The Legend of Koji\\" features Saki's distant ancestor Oroku Sancho, who lived in Japan in 1583. He is the leader of a small clan, and every bit as wicked as his descendant. When Shredder offers to help him find magical relics that would provide him with power and wealth, Sancho takes Shredder's information, then betrays him and orders his men to kill him. However, Sancho is also a coward, and when he breaks down in the face of danger, his men abandon him. This family tree leads to a bit of confusion regarding whether Shredder's given name is Oroku and his last name Saki (as indicated by the fact his brother shares the name Saki), or the other way around (as indicated by the fact his ancestor's last name is Oroku). This question is never resolved on the show, although Mirage comics adds more evidence for Oroku being the family name; Saki's brother is \\"Oroku Nagi\\". This follows Japanese naming conventions, which place the family name before an individual's given name. =Timeline= Counting from the first meeting with the Turtles, Shredder spent eight seasons plotting ways to defeat them. In the season 8 episode \\"Turtle Trek\\", the Turtles destroy the engines of the Technodrome, trapping it and its inhabitants in Dimension X for good and putting an end to Shredder's plans. He spent the next two seasons in Dimension X, until he was contacted by Dregg (\\"The Power of Three\\"). Dregg arranged for him and Krang to come back to Earth, to help him fight the Turtles. Together, they capture the Turtles, but Dregg then betrays them and tries to drain the life energy of the Turtles, Krang, and Shredder all at once, making them weaker while Dregg becomes stronger. Shredder alone escapes the trap and restores Krang (\\"A Turtle in Time\\"), but Dregg captures them again. Finally, the Turtles spoil Dregg's plan and transport Shredder and Krang back to Dimension X (\\"Turtles to the Second Power\\"). In the series finale \\"Divide and Conquer\\", the Turtles return to the Technodrome in Dimension X to take Krang's android body, which they need to fight Dregg. Shredder is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X. He and Krang also appear in Turtles Forever, with the Technodrome still under New York City before being sent into the 2003 universe. However, Shredder and Krang's incompetence (as well as their relative sanity) is fully shown when the Utrom Shredder of the 2003 universe seizes command of the Technodrome and adds Utrom technology to the powerful war machine, and turns it against the world. In the climax, Shredder temporarily overcomes his hatred for the Turtles as both he and Krang decide to help the Turtles defeat the Utrom Shredder who they realise is totally insane, will kill everyone and has effectively stolen the Technodrome from them. Shredder also takes extreme offense at being considered inferior by his other-dimensional counterpart, doesn't see the point of destroying the entire universe and does not understand why the Utrom Shredder won't just kill the Turtles when he had the chance. So, with Krang, he chooses to fight alongside the Turtles against their common foe. The Next Mutation In Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, Shredder (portrayed by Patrick Pon, voiced by Doug Parker) is still the Turtles' sworn enemy. This time, however, Venus uses her powers to make the Oroku Saki from within take control of Shredder's mind. After the Foot Clan disbands, he ends up living on the streets. Later, the Dragon Lord's rank warriors attack him to get a medallion that was in his possession. Splinter saves him and takes him to the Turtles' lair to protect him. It was hinted that Shredder might possibly go back to his old ways, but the show was canceled soon after that episode. In the show, Shredder wore a general attire similar to the one he wore in the second film, but with a heavily altered helmet/mask due to the lesser budget for the TV series as compared to the movies, which had allowed for more detailed props and costume pieces. Shredder appeared only a few times in the show, due to the primary villain of the series being a draconic being from another dimension and thus supplanted Shredder as the Turtles' nemesis. 2003 animated series Numerous individuals have assumed the \\"Shredder\\" mantle in the 2003 animated series, all of whom, except for Karai, are voiced by Scottie Ray. In the episode \\"Tempus Fugit\\", a possible future is shown in which the Utrom Shredder, Tengu Shredder, and Cyber Shredder are engaged in a war for control of New York City. =Utrom Shredder= The Shredder's armor is penetrated, revealing his true Utrom form The Utrom Shredder is the main antagonist and primary Shredder of the series. He is the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter, and indirectly had a hand in their creation. Utrom Shredder serves as the main antagonist of the first three seasons of the show as well as the finale film Turtles Forever. His digital copy also serves as the antagonist of the seventh and final season. After causing the deaths of millions across the universe, the megalomaniacal and psychopathic alien warlord Ch'rell (whose aliases include Torrinon, Kako Naso, and Duke Acureds) was captured by his fellow Utrom and being transported back to his home world to answer for his crimes. However, Ch'rell managed to escape captivity and sabotaged the Utrom ship, causing it to crash-land on Earth during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. Stranded on the then-primitive planet, the Utrom were forced to wait for centuries until human technology advanced enough for them to develop a teleportation device and return home. They thus developed humanoid exo-suits to hide amongst the humans, and Ch'rell stole the first working prototype and used the Japanese legend of a Demon Tengu to craft a dual identity, becoming a wealthy Japanese philanthropist named Oroku Saki while secretly operating as the crime lord known as the Shredder. Saki soon founded the Foot Clan, which grew into a massive underground criminal empire by the 20th century. He eventually adopts an abandoned girl named Karai, whom he personally trained in the arts of ninjutsu to lead the Foot Clan in Japan while he operated in New York City. In New York, the Shredder captures Hamato Yoshi, one of the Utroms' foremost guardians, and kills him after he refuses to reveal their location. Yoshi's pet rat Splinter witnesses his murder and escapes, winding up in the city's sewers where he and four baby turtles are accidentally exposed to a mutagenic ooze created by the Utroms, transforming them into sentient humanoid lifeforms. In the first season set over a decade later, the Turtles begin encountering the Foot Clan and unknowingly foiling several of the Shredder's operations. Oroku Saki becomes intrigued with the Turtles, wanting to meet them and hoping to bring them to his side. One day, he invites Leonardo to his home and offers him to join the Foot. The Turtles consult their master Splinter, who reveals his true nature by telling them of Master Yoshi's murder. The Shredder eventually becomes the greatest enemy of the Turtles when they decline his offer. During their first engagement, the Shredder proves himself to be more skilled than the Turtles, compelling them to flee and hide. While Shredder and his Foot Ninja search for the Turtles, Splinter finds and regroups them, and plans a counterattack. In a subsequent battle on the rooftops, the Shredder outmatches the Turtles again, but Splinter tricks him into cutting the support for a water tower, which is kicked onto him. The water sweeps Shredder off the building, and the tower collapses to the ground, crushing him. But a few scenes later, Shredder's hand is shown to emerge from the wreckage of the water tower. Splinter and the Turtles were unaware of the Shredder's survival until months later, on one day when Leonardo goes on an outdoor morning training exercise, only to be ambushed by the Foot Clan. The Shredder's four Elite Guard beat Leonardo close to death and send him flying into a window of April O'Neil's antique shop apartment, where the Turtles were staying after Foot Ninjas had marauded their sewer home while they were away. Soon afterwards, the Shredder leads an assault on April's shop. Overpowered and outnumbered, the Turtles, Splinter, April and Casey Jones are forced to run off into retreat in a walk-in cooler. The Shredder then bars the door, drops a firebomb and punctures a gas pipe with his gauntlets. Fortunately, April remembers that the motor used to power the cooler was removed, leaving a hole in the exterior wall that leads outside. As a result, the Turtles and their allies are able to evacuate the building before it burns down. They retreat to Casey's grandmother's farmhouse in Northampton, Massachusetts, where they would spend the next three months recuperating. During this time, they are presumed dead by the Foot, but Oroku Saki sends the clan's mad scientist Baxter Stockman the task of confirming their deaths. Although Stockman finds no proof that the Turtles died, he creates false evidence to convince the Shredder and succeeds in doing so. When Leonardo is completely healed from his injuries, the Turtles and Splinter return to New York to face the Shredder once more. They launch a surprise assault on the Foot headquarters, fighting their way through Shredder's minions and eventually reaching his throne. By the end of the battle, an epic standoff between Leonardo and the Shredder occurs. Armed with the Sword of Tengu, the former decapitates the latter when they strike each other in one final clash. Not knowing that the Shredder is an Utrom, the Turtles believe him to be finally killed for good. After they leave, the Shredder is seen to be getting up and walking away carrying his severed head. In the second season, Ch'rell seeks to exact revenge on his species. He and his henchmen infiltrate the TCRI facility, where the Utroms' base is located, and coincidentally encounter the Turtles and Master Splinter. When the Shredder is zapped into unconsciousness, a time bomb slips out of his hands, set to detonate in ten minutes. The Turtles help the Utroms escape using the Transmat, a teleportation device, which Donatello activates. After the Utroms teleport back to their homeworld, the Shredder awakens and attacks the Turtles. In the ensuing fight, the Turtles use their weapons to penetrate his armor, which is then electrocuted by Donatello, disabling it. Afterwards, the Shredder reveals his Utrom form to the Turtles, intent on taking down his enemies with him. But at the last few seconds, Donatello manages to power up the Transmat, through which he, his brothers and Splinter escape before the TCRI building implodes with Ch'rell inside of it. With his supposed demise, the Foot Clan (led by the Elite Guard), the Purple Dragons and the New York Mafia clash with each other for control of New York City. Unknown to them, the Shredder had survived once more and was retrieved by his daughter Karai, now being placed in a stasis tube and healed by worms inside a secret medical facility of the Foot headquarters. During his recuperation, Karai assumes leadership of the Foot Clan and makes peace with the Turtles after they help her end the turf war. But once the Shredder is fully recovered, he vows vengeance and breaks off the truce, leaving Karai to question her loyalty. By this point, Baxter Stockman had created the Foot Mechs, mainly in the form of armed ninja robots, but also versions of the U.S. President, the English Prime Minister and Splinter. His plans were again thwarted by the Turtles, when his barge hideout is located by them, Splinter, and their unlikely ally, the delusional Triceraton Zog, leading to another confrontation with the Foot. Aboard the freighter, Donatello programs a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes. The Shredder is defeated again when Zog sacrifices his life by keeping him on his ship when it sinks due to the explosion, but Karai rescues him on a helicopter. In the third season, the Triceratons launch an invasion on Earth. In the aftermath of the invasion, New York City is in ruins. In his persona as Oroku Saki, the Shredder uses his fortune to repair the damage and gains favor of its citizens. Secretly, his real purpose of reconstruction was to salvage the remnants of Triceraton technology in order to construct a large starship to return to the stars, and thereby retaliating against the Utrom. He even enlists a young scientist named Dr. Chaplin to help out. The craft is eventually completed, but Ch'rell's plan suffers several complications, courtesy of the Turtles and the Earth Protection Force (led by Agent Bishop). Despite sustaining heavy damage, the ship is launched into orbit, albeit with the Turtles and Splinter on board. When Karai notes that they left their forces on Earth, Ch'rell states that he has allies on other worlds that can help him. Entering a four-armed Shredder exo-suit, Ch'rell easily defeats them all, prompting the Turtles and Splinter to attempt to sacrifice themselves and blow the ship up in a final attempt to stop the Shredder. Luckily, as the starship explodes, Mortu and the Utrom arrive, having placed a stasis field around the entire ship, freezing time, and teleport all its inhabitants to safety. While the Turtles and Splinter are teleported to sick bay and Professor Honeycutt is taken to one of their labs to be placed in a new robot body, Ch'rell, Karai, and Dr. Chaplin are teleported to the brig. On the Utrom homeworld, Ch'rell is placed on trial before the Utrom High Council that is watched by the Turtles, Splinter, and Professor Honeycutt. The Utrom High Council start by mentioning a testimony from Dolphette that Ch'rell willingly launched an attack on the planet Enethone where over 1 million innocent inhabitants perished. Then they bring up Wan-ran Otho's testimony where Ch'rell incited and funded a civil war on the planet Eno II in an effort to mine their raw minerals without restriction. 3,200,000 lives perished. The Utrom High Council then concludes that Ch'rell tried various attempts to take over the Utrom government through an illegal and violent coup. The Utrom High Council found Ch'rell guilty for the chaos and destruction he brought across the universe, and ultimately sentence him to eternal exile on the desolate ice asteroid Mor Gal Tal. Mortu states to everyone present that Karai and Dr. Chaplin will be returned to Earth and handed over to the authorities. In the finale film Turtles Forever, Ch'rell is freed from his exile by his Shredder counterpart from the 1987 series after his frozen body was teleported off of Mor Gal Tal by 1980s Shredder and Krang. Once Karai showed up upon finding out about Ch'rell's return, Ch'rell then takes over the Technodrome and gains a new, more powerful exo-suit. After realigning with a now-mutated Hun, Ch'rell reverse-engineers the mutagen that Hun got to turn a select number of Cyber Foot into Mutant Foot Soldiers and create new Foot Robots that are stronger than the '80s versions. The Ch'rell later uses the Technodrome to view alternate dimensions, realizing that there is an entire multiverse of Ninja Turtles. Locating the Turtles' source planet, Turtle Prime, Ch'rell vows to eliminate every Ninja Turtle in existence by destroying this dimension. The Mirage Turtles, the 1987 Turtles, and the 2003 Turtles team up to defeat Ch'rell, though Karai and Splinter agree that the Shredder will return again as he always does. In \\"Same As It Never Was\\", Donatello is transported to an alternate future in which the Shredder has succeeded in subjugating Earth. By then, Splinter had died protecting his sons and Casey Jones died fighting the Foot Clan. Ch'rell also severed Michelangelo's left arm and Raphael's left eye. When Donatello leads a final rebellion against the Shredder's fortress, his Foot forces kill Michelangelo while Karai kills Leonardo and Raphael. April avenges Leonardo and Raphael by using a rocket launcher on Karai, and the Shredder is killed by Donatello with the Tuneller. In \\"Timing is Everything\\", Leonardo and Cody Jones are accidentally sent back in time to the aftermath of the Turtles' first battle with the Shredder. Later, the Shredder and several Foot ninjas are transported to 2105 but are easily defeated by the Turtles' futuristic technology. =Demon Shredder= The Shredder Tengu or the original Demon Shredder serves as the main antagonist of the fifth season. The very first Shredder was a Demonic Tengu that rose from a hellish pit and terrorized ancient Japan. After a fierce battle when on the verge of death at the hands of the Five Dragons, it brokered a deal to enter and possessed their fifth member; a human named Oroku Saki, one of Japan's most skilled warriors and strongest of the warrior collective who confronted it. Tempted by the demon's promises of power the man welcomed the monster's essence into his being and assumed all of its terrible powers. Gaining vast magical ability precluding to flight, augmented dark chi, concussion blast projection, vast physical ability; able to toss the Silver Sentry into low orbit, telekinesis and reality manipulation amongst many other capabilities. His reign of terror would come to an end however as the original Shredder was eventually defeated by the power of his former comrades, each of whom having mastered powerful metaphysical practices of their own in order to combat their corrupted number. In defeating and concealing the evil warlord, the remaining dragons would fade from historical memory in order to become the Ninja Tribunal. A quartet of immortal warriors who spent the next couple of centuries watching over the demonic conquerors remains; having his body, helmet, and gauntlet separated and sealed away at differing locales to prevent his return. Later in the 21st century, the Tengu Shredder's five Foot Mystic heralds would attempt to resurrect him. First enlisting a bone demon backed by their mystic amulet to bypass the Tribunal, Master Splinter and the Ancient One's vast insight. But was undone by the youthful turtles who saw through said trinket's arcana. Something which would pique the ageless ninja master's interest before they erased the striplings' memories of the event. Years later the onset of the true Shredder's return forces the Ninja Tribunal to recruit the same Turtles alongside four human warriors as their Acolytes whom they would train in their ways for the purpose of preventing Saki's resurrection. After the Demon Shredder rises from the dead and conquers New York City, the Turtles recruit Karai's Foot Clan, the Justice Force, the Earth Protection Force, and the Purple Dragons to defeat him. The Demon Shredder is weakened when Karai drains his power via a mystic link (which connects all who take the mantle of the Shredder), and he is finally destroyed when the Turtles combine their Dragon avatars to summon the spirit of Hamato Yoshi who delivers the final blow ending the Demon Shredder for good. Something which the Ninja Tribunal had been aware of all along, revealing themselves to all who thought they'ed perished. Going onto say that the sands of fate had to fall where they lay so that the ones whom could slay the demonic tyrant would come of age, explaining as to why they had let Yoshi meet his demise as it led to Splinter and his turtle son's rise to prominence to aid the Tribunal in the end. =Cyber Shredder= The Cyber Shredder appears as the main antagonist of the seventh and final season, Back to the Sewer. It is revealed that prior to Ch'rell's exile, he created a digital copy of himself in the event that anything happened to his corporeal form and stored this double in a Foot data vault deep within the Internet. This vault's consciousness is later released when the futuristic Viral attempts to access it, giving rise to the Cyber Shredder. While he is initially confined to cyberspace, the Cyber Shredder ultimately manages to escape and become a physical being. During the final episode, the Cyber Shredder leads the Foot Clan to attack April O'Neil and Casey Jones's wedding, and is finally defeated when the Turtles erased him with a de- compiler previously used against Viral. =Karai= Karai is the adopted daughter of Oroku Saki (Ch'rell), who takes the mantle of the Shredder after her father's exile. After some lesser battles, she doffs the mantle and begins a non-hostile relationship with the Turtles, particularly towards Leonardo. 2012 animated series The Shredder appears as the main antagonist of the 2012 animated series, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. His Japanese origins as Oroku Saki and brotherly relationship with Hamato Yoshi is mostly intact, with the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan being later revealed as having a long- term rivalry before the Hamato family killed the Oroku family, wiped out their entire clan (starting with the destruction of the Foot Clan monastery) and took in the orphaned Saki as their own. Despite being raised as brothers, both Saki and Yoshi eventually became rivals due to the love of Tang Shen, whose decision to marry Yoshi drove Saki to discover his true heritage and turn on his former brother, eventually destroying everything Yoshi held dear, including the lovely Tang Shen (whom he had killed by accident) and the entire Hamato Clan (starting with the destruction of the Hamato Clan monastery, which resulted with Saki's head getting burned scarred and hairless). Blaming Tang Shen's untimely death on Yoshi, Saki returned to his biological family and became the new leader of the newly restored Foot Clan, tutoring ninjutsu students such as world-famous martial artist Chris Bradford and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes, sharing criminal business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer Ivan Steranko, Sicilian mob boss Don Visiozo, and Purple Dragons leader Hun. In addition, he also a pet akita named Hachiko (named after the akita of the same name) who played a part in Bradford's mutation into Dogpound after Hachiko bit him. Shredder first appeared in the end of \\"Rise of the Turtles, Part 2\\" where he traveled to New York when he learned that Hamato Yoshi is training his own ninjas after seeing a shuriken with his clan symbol on a shuriken left behind by the Turtles during a recent fight on a TV news report. Determined to finally end his age-old rival's life, he sent the Foot Clan after the Turtles until he made his first confrontation with the Turtles in person in \\"The Gauntlet\\", where victory was seemingly in his grasp before he was distracted by the mutating Bradford and Montes. Although Shredder planned to kill former TCRI inventor Baxter Stockman for interfering with his plans to kill the Turtles in \\"MOUSERS Attack\\", he changed his mind by commenting on how Stockman's scientific knowledge could be useful to him. Shredder is also Karai's father, as seen in \\"New Girl in Town\\". However, in \\"Showdown\\", during Shredder's battle with Splinter, he reveals that in the aftermath of the fight that caused Tang Shen's death, he took Splinter's daughter, Miwa, and raised her as Karai. He has told her that he is her biological father and it was Splinter who killed her mother, as she has sworn revenge ever since. Shredder initially dismissed the Kraang's presence in New York, but after capturing one, decided to ally with them to destroy the Turtles. The partnership seems stable, though it would seem the Shredder still did not fully trust his new allies. Early in the second season, in \\"Follow the Leader\\", he left for Japan to deal with a situation, leaving Karai as the interim leader of his Foot Clan. He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any dealings with the Kraang behind his back, and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in \\"The Manhattan Project\\", with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder's deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw was able to bring Splinter before him, but complication from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles' own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In \\"The Wrath of Tiger Claw\\", Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in \\"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto\\", where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. After his helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto, was stolen by professional thief Anton Zeck on behalf of Steranko, Shredder found Zeck's calling card on a glued-down Rahzar and ordered the entire clan before him. Explaining the helmet's history as a special Foot Clan relic, he had the clan hunt for Zeck, sending Fishface with Stockman-Fly and Rahzar with Tiger Claw. Leonardo later confronted Shredder with the Kabuto for a trade and kept him busy long enough for the other Turtles to get to Karai. However, the \\"Karai\\" Shredder traded them with turned out to be a dummy rigged with a bomb as the Turtles evaded it. In \\"Vengeance is Mine\\", Shredder attempted to use the real Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself. In the two-part second-season finale \\"The Invasion\\", Shredder and Kraang Prime formed a full alliance in which Shredder and the Foot Clan will help the Kraang take over New York and then the world and in turn, the Kraang would return Karai to normal, and deliver Splinter and the Turtles to him. Later, he watched as Leonardo fought and eventually defeated his army of Foot Bots, after which he sent Rahzar, Fishface, and Tiger Claw to take care of him. Leonardo managed to subdue them for a short period of time before Shredder got involved and badly injured Leonardo. Later, Splinter confronted him and the two battled until Splinter got trapped under large metal pipes. Shredder was prepared to kill his rival once and for all; however, Leatherhead intervened, and was defeated when Shredder sliced the front of his torso and kicked him off the edge of the dock. Splinter became furious as he broke out from under the pipes and tackled Shredder to the sewers. Later, the Turtles (minus Leonardo) and April watched helplessly from behind metal bars as Shredder defeated Splinter and seemingly killed him by throwing him down a large draining bay. In the middle of the third season in \\"Return to New York\\", tensions began to grow high within the Foot of their alliance with the Kraang, but Shredder convinced everyone that he will keep his promise to take the city back from them. After a feral Splinter was found by the Foot-Bots and taken before him, Shredder had Stockman-Fly work on restoring his memory, which is what April did instead with her Kraang powers when she, the Turtles and Casey Jones returned to the city to rescue their sensei. In \\"The Pig and the Rhino\\", Shredder sent a now mutated Steranko and Zeck (who are later renamed Bebop and Rocksteady by Michelangelo) to find Karai again, like they did recently before the Turtles helped her escape, or else they'll be given something even more painful than mutation. After the Turtles unknowingly led them to her, the two succeeded in re-capturing Karai (while the Turtles weren't looking) and delivering her back to Shredder, who promised to fix everything he's done to her. The Kraang invasion eventually came to a stop made by the Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals, but its effects had eventually gave Shredder a gift for his cooperation with the Kraang, which shifted the balance of power within the city's criminal underworld over to the Foot. For him, this was achieved by gaining control of the Purple Dragons and other Asian gangs through Hun, several South American gangs through Fishface, the Russian mob through Rocksteady, and the Sicilian mob through Vizioso. By using this power, Shredder had these crime groups aid him with collecting various chemicals from a chemical company called Aumen Chemicals, an abandoned Kraang lab and Vizioso for a mind-control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals, and Karai. In the two-part season 3 finale, Annihilation: Earth! he briefly teams up with Splinter to stop a black hole machine that was to destroy the Earth. He briefly fought the Triceratons until he followed Splinter, double-crossing and stabbing him in the back, killing him instantly in front of the turtles. They rushed to Splinter while April blew Shredder away with a blast from her mind. Proclaiming that his victory over Splinter is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and Splinter while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth's destruction and then in \\"Beyond the Known Universe\\", they travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening. In \\"Earth's Last Stand\\" these events were revisited, but the arrival of the Turtles from the future resulted in Shredder's attempt to murder Splinter being thwarted. The two engaged briefly in battle with Splinter proving victorious, and the unconscious Shredder was carried away by Tiger Claw. In \\"City at War\\" due to the injuries he sustained from Splinter, Shredder has been confined to a hospital bed under the care of Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take Shredder down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, Shredder decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to Shredder, and as the mutagen is injected into Shredder, his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In \\"The Insecta Trifecta\\", Shredder is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, Shredder is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as Shredder deploys a pair of blades from the back of his hand, right out of the skin itself. In \\"The Super Shredder\\", Shredder forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super Shredder form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. This form left him with blades coming out of his body, a muscular build, and bandaged feet and ankles. Shredder then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the Shredder along with Shinigami, but Shredder easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him (The Shell Raiser), and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. Shredder then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. Shredder then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then lights fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach Shredder, Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. Shredder forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads Shredder to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. Shredder eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. Shredder then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as Shredder was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and Shredder fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, \\"Darkest Plight\\", Shredder and Splinter are separated during the fall, and Shredder returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, Shredder goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, Shredder tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at Shredder. However, before Shredder can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures Shredder in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, Shredder is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where Shredder demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, Shredder overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In \\"Tale of Tiger Claw\\", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter. In \\"Requiem\\", he returns to New York City, far stronger and more vengeful than ever before. He shows up at the hideout where Karai is planning her next move with Shnigami and the Mighty Mutanimals. He defeats the Mutanimals effortlessly and badly injures Karai in the process. On the WOLF building, he faces off against Splinter, Slash, Raphael, April and Casey. He ultimately manages to murder Splinter and hurls him from the building to his death. He is then blasted by a tremendously powerful psychic wave from an enraged April, and is crushed by a garbage truck, though he again survives the onslaught. In the season four finale \\"Owari\\" he has his lackeys prepare for the inevitable arrival of the Turtles, April and Casey. He burns down his new lair and confronts the Turtles in a final showdown on the roof. His unique mutation makes him immune to Donatello's retro-mutagen, which allows him to beat Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo all at once, leaving only Leonardo left standing. After a heated one-on-one duel, Shredder is finally killed by Leonardo. Many months later, the Kabuto and his own heart were separated by unknown means and hidden in secret locations throughout New York. His heart was contained within a glass vial that came into the possession of Don Vzioso, which Tiger Claw and Kavaxas seek, as it is essential to revive him and then came back in a zombie-like form that wanted to die. Zombie Shredder was able to drag Kavaxas back to the Netherworld as they \\"belong dead.\\" 2018 animated series Shredder appears in the 2018 animated series voiced by Hoon Lee. 500 years before the series, Oroku Saki was the leader of the peaceful Foot Clan and father of the Hamato Clan founder, Karai, whose soul was swallowed by the demonic and nigh-unstoppable Kuroi Y≈çroi armor after it was forged by a horrible Oni (that resembled Krang). After being reborn as the Shredder, Saki turned the Foot into a cult that worshipped his dark power. With no other choice, Karai was forced to create her own clan, the Hamato Clan, to combat the power of the demon and the Foot. Shredder terrorized Japan until he was defeated by the Hamato Clan, due to Karai using a mystic blade to send Shredder into a dimension called the Twilight Realm, and the Kuroi Y≈çroi was scattered across the world to prevent his return. The side effect of Shredder's defeat had sent Karai into the Twilight Realm, along with Shredder's sapience being sealed away. The Foot, allied with Baron Draxum, began collecting the armor pieces to resurrect him starting in \\"Shadow of Evil.\\" In \\"Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree\\", Draxum claimed the gauntlet in Warren Stone's possession that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Y≈çroi. In \\"Operation: Normal\\", the Foot Brute and the Foot Recruit targeted the slime Y≈çkai, Sunita, because the boots she was wearing were part of the Kuroi Y≈çroi. They managed to claim them. In \\"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will\\", Draxum and the Foot Recruit find out that a Kuroi Y≈çroi fragment is at the Botanical Gardens. They claimed it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail. After obtaining the fragment, Draxum declared himself to be the Foot's leader, via exploiting a loophole in the clan's rulings of leadership. However, Draxum was completely oblivious to the fact that the Foot were just manipulating him into reviving their true leader, as they needed a being of great mystic power to energize the armor in order to resurrect Shredder (they were unaware that Shredder wouldn't regain his sapience upon resurrection). In \\"One Man's Junk\\", the next piece of the Kuroi Y≈çroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis, who claimed it from a Y≈çkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant, Mrs. Nubbins who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought the metal from him. This caused the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal. After the Kuroi Y≈çroi was completed in \\"End Game\\", Draxum donned the armor with the intention of destroying humanity once and for all. The Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute addressed him as Shredder, but he rejected the title, confused with the name \\"Shredder\\". Furthermore, due to a flaw in the armor (the Turtles' Jupiter Jim action figure was shoved in to cover a hole when the faceplate was used as a tea kettle), it wasn't properly able to drain Draxum's power. After Draxum was defeated and spat out of the armor, due to April knocking a baseball against the action figure, it reassembled itself, having drained Draxum of his life force. In \\"Many Happy Returns\\", Shredder acted like a feral beast, due to his sapience still being sealed in the Twilight Realm. After being attacked by the demon, the Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreated to find out what went wrong. After discovering a flux in Shredder's quantum energy, causing him to randomly phase in and out between Earth and the Twilight Realm, Big Mama was able to provide a bauble for the Turtles and Splinter to trap Shredder in another dimension, though she made a secret last- minute alteration to this plan. In \\"Battle Nexus: New York,\\" Big Mama secretly attached a control device and it's associated magic ring to the Shredder, and controlled him under the alias of Shadow Fiend. This was discovered during the Turtles, Splinter, April, and the redeemed Draxum's fight with Big Mama. When the ring was removed from Big Mama during the fight, the Foot Recruit claimed it. Before Leonardo can portal Big Mama out, she got cut off. The Foot Recruit, furious that her master was enslaved, sinisterly told Big Mama that she was about to lose everything and advised her to run. The Shredder then destroyed the Grand Nexus Hotel, flying out into the city with the Foot Recruit on his back. Films The Shredder was played by James Saito in the first movie and by Fran√ßois Chau in the second, while his immense Super Shredder form was played by professional wrestler Kevin Nash.Kevin Nash (I) In all cases, the character was voiced by David McCharen. The Shredder's costume was, in the first movie, originally the same as in the original comic, with a red color. However, this was changed in the sequel to a violet color, reflecting the more cartoonish nature of the second film. In both movies, he also had a silver and black cape. In both films, he is served by his second- in-command Tatsu. In the Japanese versions, the Shredder is voiced by Norio Wakamoto (1st movie in VHS version), Hidekatsu Shibata (first movie in TV version), and Takeshi Watabe (second movie). Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) James Saito as The Shredder in the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) In the first movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were rival martial artists in Japan and both loved a woman named Tang Shen. Shen, who loved only Yoshi, persuaded him not to fight Saki honorably; instead, they fled for the United States. Saki followed them to New York City; when Yoshi returned home from his construction job he found his beloved Shen lying on the floor. And then, he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words and during the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken. Splinter leaped up into Saki's face, biting and clawing. But Saki threw him to the floor and took one swipe with his katana, slicing Splinter's ear. After this incident, it was said that Saki is never heard from again. The comic book adaptation of the film retains the original comic book origin story, with Oroku Nagi being slain and Saki coming to America to seek vengeance. Saki, in the \\"Shredder\\" persona, establishes an American branch of the Foot Clan. With the aid of his second- in-command Tatsu, he manipulates and recruits troubled teens as a brutal yet Machiavellian leader and father figure, teaching them ninjitsu to make them into skilled thieves and assassins. Shredder sends the Foot Clan to \\"silence\\" April O'Neil when she reports on the Foot Clan's connection to the recent crime wave, inadvertently leading them to the Turtles' hideout when Raphael saves April. Shredder had Splinter kidnapped and imprisoned him in his warehouse hideout, and has the Foot Clan hunt the Turtles. He beats Splinter while interrogating him about how the Turtles learned their fighting techniques. After the Turtles successfully defeat the Foot Clan in a final assault, Shredder confronts them on a rooftop. He defeats all of the Turtles with his superior skills and threatens Leonardo with his yari to force the others to toss away their weapons. Splinter, freed by Turtles' allies, Danny Pennington and Casey Jones, intervenes and reveals to Shredder that they met years ago, as he was Hamato Yoshi's pet. Shredder unmasks himself, revealing the scars that Splinter gave him, and charges towards Splinter to impale him. Splinter counters with Michelangelo's nunchaku to send him over the side of the roof. Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter. Splinter caught the knife, but had to let go of the nunchaku that was holding onto the spear, making Shredder fall into a parked garbage truck far below. Casey Jones then activates the crushing mechanism; the viewers are then shown a closeup of the Shredder's helmet being crushed, implying his death. TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991) In the second movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, the Turtles believe that since Casey had crushed him in the garbage truck, the Shredder was dead. It is soon revealed that Shredder had survived the crushing and revitalized his Foot Clan to get vengeance on the Turtles. After finding the Foot \\"fallback\\" headquarters in a junkyard, Tatsu was asking who would challenge him to cover for Shredder until Shredder appeared. Tatsu allowed Shredder to lead the Foot Clan. Shredder sent a member of the Foot to follow April, hoping to find the Turtles through her. When April's team was doing a report on T.G.R.I. in New Jersey, April's camera operator/Foot Clan member Freddy found some mutated dandelions and sent one to the Shredder. He then orders Tatsu to obtain a sample of the T.G.R.I. mutagen that mutated the Turtles, as well as kidnap researcher Jordan Perry. Using the last mutagen and Perry's research, the Shredder creates his own mutants, Tokka and Rahzar, from a stolen snapping turtle and a brown wolf respectively. Though initially enraged at their infant-like intelligence, he soon plays it to his advantage by manipulating the mutants as they imprinted him as their surrogate parent. After a failed attempt to kill the Turtles in the junkyard using a captured Raphael, Shredder unleashed Tokka and Rahzar onto a city street to \\"have fun\\" and destroy it. The Foot spy then gave April a message for the Turtles: that the Shredder would turn the mutants loose on Central Park next if they did not accede to a rematch at the construction site. After the Turtles de-mutate the two mutants (with help from Perry) and defeat Tatsu in a nightclub, the Shredder appears and threatens to mutate an innocent woman with a small reserve mutagen vial (the canister was knocked away by the Turtles' new human ally, Keno). Before he can mutate her, he is stopped when the Turtles play a keytar at full volume, sending the Shredder flying through a window from the force of a blown speaker. When the Turtles follow him outside on a pier, they discover that the Shredder has used the mutagen vial on himself. He is transformed into a massive \\"Super Shredder\\", an almost mindless giant-mutant being with immense superhuman strength. During his fight with the Turtles, Super Shredder knocks down the pier's pilings in a mindless rage, which then collapses onto him with the Turtles falling into the water below. Though the Turtles survive, the Shredder meets his demise from getting crushed by the destroyed pieces of the pier. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) and TMNT (2007) The Shredder did not appear in the third film but is shown briefly at the beginning of the fourth film to help give the backstory of the Turtles, and his helmet that he wore in the 1990 film is visible on Splinter's shelf of mementos at the end of the movie. The possibility of his return is also strongly hinted at in the end of the film by Karai. However, the established storyline was abandoned in favor of the 2014 reboot. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) Japanese American actor Tohoru Masamune portrayed the Shredder in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Initially, William Fichtner was intended to portray a Caucasian version of the Shredder, with the anglicized real name of Eric Sacks, instead of Oroku Saki. This idea was abandoned late in production in favor of featuring a Shredder of authentic Japanese ancestry, and the film went through re-shoots to change Fichtner's character of Sacks into being the Shredder's student. The change came too late to alter the film's Nintendo 3DS tie-in video game, and Sacks remains the Shredder in it. In contrast to much of the brand's history, Sacks, not Shredder, is the character connected to the Turtles' origins, having created them alongside April O'Neil's father; the Shredder (never referred to with any name other than his codename) has no connection to Splinter or the Turtles, and while he is shown to have scars on his face, it is not revealed how he suffered them. In the earliest stages of development for the film, Shredder was reimagined as \\"Colonel Schrader\\", the military leader of the black-ops unit \\"The Foot\\", revealed later in the script to be a yellow-skinned, red-eyed alien with the ability to sprout spikes. This idea was dropped after Evan Daugherty was hired to rewrite the script in early 2013.'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Release Pushed To June 6, 2014 Retrieved July 2, 2013 In the film, Shredder is the leader of the Foot Clan, who is terrorizing New York City. After a vigilante stops the Foot Clan, Shredder orders the Foot to take hostages down the subway in order to lure the vigilante out. Later in the film, Shredder's adopted son, Eric Sacks, informs Shredder that the vigilante is in fact four mutated Turtles who are test subjects of Project Renaissance, a science experiment of April O'Neil's late father. Sacks gives Shredder an armed suit and a helmet, the latter and the Foot Clan attack the Turtles' lair, where he defeats Splinter and kidnaps three Turtles after Raphael was presumed dead. Sacks drains the Turtles' blood in order to create mutagen so that he can complete his and Shredder's plan: the latter will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease, making him even richer. As Shredder prepares to release the virus, the Turtles escape and confront him. Although he nearly defeats them, the Turtles were able to conquer Shredder with the help of April, which causes him to fall from the building on which he stood, but he survives and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) Brian Tee portrayed Shredder in the 2016 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. In the beginning of the movie, the Foot Clan, led by a scientist named Baxter Stockman, attempt to help Shredder escape from prison. Although the turtles try to prevent the escape, Stockman was able to help Shredder escape using a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid- teleport and ends up in a place called Dimension X. There, he meets Krang, who gives Shredder a mutagen canister in exchange for a promise to find the three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago, which when united will open a portal to his dimension. Shredder returns to New York City and recruits two criminals named Bebop and Rocksteady and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them to powerful animal mutants- a warthog and rhinoceros. Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady find the components in a museum in New York and in a jungle in Brazil. Shredder and Stockman unite the components, creating a portal to Krang's dimension. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away, but upon entering the Technodrome, Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes. Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Andrew Kishino voices Shredder in the crossover animated film, Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In the film, Shredder allies his forces with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins to build a machine designed to transform Gotham's citizens into unhinged mutants. In exchange for his assistance, Ra's promises Shredder access to one of his Lazarus Pits, which would grant him eternal life. When he and the Foot Clan try to steal a cloud seeder from Wayne Enterprises, he ends up fighting Batman and barely comes out victorious after using an ancient technique. Later, he fights Batman once more when the Turtles and the Bat Family arrive at Ace Chemicals to stop him and Ra's from activating the machine. Though he gains the upper hand on the Dark Knight once again, he is thrown off when Batman says \\"Cowabunga\\" and gains assistance from Raphael. After Michaelangelo and Donatello destroy the machine, the debris sends him into a vat of chemicals as the plant explodes. In the post-credits scene, he is revealed to have survived the explosion and now strongly resembles the Joker. Video games As the original TMNT video games are mostly based on the 1987 cartoon, Shredder is often based on his first cartoon incarnation. He usually executes some plan to provoke the Turtles into retaliating and defeat them; these include kidnapping April O'Neil and stealing the Statue of Liberty. Shredder is usually the last boss in the games. *'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES, 1989): Shredder is the final boss. He is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He causes the Turtles to lose roughly half their energy if he touches them, and has a gun that can de-mutate them, which instantly kills them. He wears a red costume like in the Mirage comics. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade, 1989): Once again, Shredder is the final boss and is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He is armed with a sword, and has the ability to clone himself (the exact number of clones is one more than the number of Turtles attacking him in the arcade version). Shredder and his clones also have the ability to shoot lightning bolts from a device on the helmet, which de-mutate the Turtles they hit, killing them. When Shredder or one of his clones is close to death, his helmet falls off, a unique occurrence in the game series. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan (1990): This game was the first one not to feature Shredder as the final boss. Instead, Shredder is the boss of the penultimate stage, which is set in a river. It is also the first game in which Shredder does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles. His only attack is a sword swipe, but he can teleport if hit. The final boss is Krang. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Manhattan Missions (1991): In this PC game, Shredder fights the turtles in his Manhattan hideout, decorated in a Japanese style. His appearance is based on the Mirage comic version. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project (1992): This game is the first to feature both a battle against Shredder and a second one against a mutated Super Shredder. The first battle takes place at the end of the Technodrome level, which is the sixth of the eight levels of the game. In this battle, Shredder uses a sword to attack the Turtles. Shredder later returns as the final boss of the game, on the stage set in Krang's spacecraft. This time, he mutates himself into Super Shredder, much as he did in the second movie which had been released earlier the same year (1991). Super Shredder has two superpowers, the ability to call down lightning, and the ability to shoot fireballs. These fireballs can de-mutate the Turtles, but unlike other games, this is not an instant kill. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers (1991): A sequel to Fall of the Foot Clan, this game also features Shredder as a regular level boss and Krang as the final boss. He does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles, but he does have a wider variety of attacks than in the previous Game Boy game. Shredder returns later in his mutated Super Shredder form, as a sub-level boss of the final Technodrome level. However, in this incarnation, his only super-power is the ability to teleport elsewhere on the screen. He attacks the Turtles using a sword. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time (1991): Shredder is again the final boss of the game, and found in the Technodrome. However, this time, he is not preceded by a Technodrome level. Instead, the Turtles fight through a Starbase level in the future (2100 AD) with Krang as boss, then teleport to the Technodrome in the present (1991 in the arcade game and 1992 in the SNES version) for the final confrontation. Shredder attacks with a sword, and can fire energy attacks. In the SNES port of the game, Shredder begins the battle by mutating himself into Super Shredder, and has the added superpowers of super-speed movement, fire ground attacks, ice air attacks, and a de-mutating fire ball which costs a turtle a life. The SNES port also added a Technodrome level earlier in the game, which leads to a battle with a regular Shredder. In this battle, Shredder is in a kind of battletank, armed with a machine gun and claws. The player views the action over Shredder's shoulder inside the tank, and the only way to cause damage is to hurl the never-ending waves of Foot Soldiers toward the screen and into the tank. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist (1992): This game uses a Super Shredder similar to the one in Turtles in Time. His attacks are roughly the same. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue (1993): Unlike its two predecessors, Fall of the Foot Clan and Back from the Sewers, this game does feature Shredder as the final boss. However, this time Shredder has become Cyber Shredder, half-man and half-machine. This form of Shredder possessed deadly kick moves and energy ball attacks, as well as being the only boss in the game with two life meters, as the meter instantly refills after it is drained the first time. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters (1993): This is the first game in which Shredder is not a boss but instead a regular playable character. Furthermore, his costume is based on the Mirage comics version. Finally, in the SNES incarnation of this game, he appears under the name Cyber-Shredder, but there is no indication that he has become a cybernetic being as in Radical Rescue. After a 10-year hiatus, a new series of TMNT games was initiated. These new games are based on the 2003 cartoon series, and likewise, Shredder in the games is the same as in the cartoon. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003): Shredder appears as the final boss. The Turtles face him on the helicarrier at the top of the Foot Helicarriers; he wields the Sword of Tengu in this fight. Shredder's combo attacks are quick and nearly continuous. When half of his health bar has been depleted, his attacks become much faster. There is also a secret final boss in which the player faces Shredder as Oroku Saki. His combos are much quicker and deadlier, and he also has a temporary powered-up state. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus (2004): The game begins a short while before the end of the previous game, and Shredder is encountered by the Turtles in the second stage of the game; however, he is not fought by the player, only in a cutscene. As in the cartoon, Shredder is defeated, but he survives the assault on his headquarters. Shredder resurfaces in the TCRI building later on, but once again, the player does not directly fight him; the main goal of the mission being to evacuate the Utroms back to their home planet. He is seemingly killed in the destruction of the TCRI building, but he once again survives. In a sub-plot exclusive to the game, he is detailed as being a mass murderer of Utroms on their homeworld, and he gave Utrom mercenary Slashurr a permanent scar. He later wiped Slashurr's memory, and employed him to kill the Turtles. However, Slashurr eventually remembers his past, and with the Turtles, battles Shredder and the Foot on his ship. The Turtles eventually defeat Shredder once again. In the Battle Nexus fighting tournament mode, Shredder appears as the final boss of the Foot Fight tournament, though the nature of these tournaments when it comes to the game's canon is questionable. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee (2005): Shredder appeared as a playable character and opponent in three forms‚Äîhis standard armor, without the armor (as Oroku Saki), and a golden \\"Mega\\" Shredder. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare (2005) The third chapter of the game, \\"Exodus\\", deals directly with the Turtles thwarting the Foot's efforts. As in the third-season finale, the Turtles and Splinter battle the Foot at their headquarters, and follow the Shredder aboard his starship. They nearly sacrifice themselves to kill Shredder as well, but the Utroms rescue them, and exile Shredder to a distant ice asteroid forever. Shredder is also encountered in the dark future as one of the final bosses of the Nightmare chapter of the game. *TMNT (2007): In the console versions of the 2007 movie-based game, Shredder appears as a boss in a flashback-within-a- flashback (as the events of the game are told to Splinter after their occurrence). The armor of Shredder in this game is based on the 2003 cartoon series version. *TMNT: Smash Up (2009): Shredder is a playable character in the PS2 and Wii fighting game. He appears in both his Utrom Shredder and Cyber Shredder forms. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2013): Shredder appears as both the penultimate and final boss of the game. He recruits Baxter Stockman to build a new helmet for him using stolen Krang technology, which gives him telekinetic powers, including the ability to fly. Shredder is first fought in his lair when the Turtles come to save April and learn about his scheme. After escaping, he is fought again in the Krangs's secret undergroung facility, this time donning his new helmet built by Stockman. He is ultimately defeated by the Turtles, who destroy his helmet, leaving him to swear revenge. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014): The Nintendo 3DS game based on the 2014 film, Shredder, who is actually Eric Sacks, appears as the final boss. However, after defeating him, it is revealed that it was all an illusion created by Baxter Stockman, to allow the real Shredder to escape. *Nickelodeon Kart Racers (2018): Shredder appears as a non-playable background character in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles tracks, based on the 2012 incarnation. *Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix (2020): Shredder appears as a playable driver, once again based on his 2012 appearance. Other appearances In the anime adaptation Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen, the backstory from the original cartoon was preserved. Unlike the rest of the main cast, Shredder's appearance was changed to match the Supermutants Shredder toy that was being sold at that time. The manga explained this by saying his original outfit was destroyed in a battle with the Turtles and Krang created the new armor for him. Shredder also gains the ability to transform into the dragon Devil Shredder using the Mutanite crystals he stole from the Neutrinos. With the energy from the evil sprite Dark Mu, he was later able to transform into the gigantic Dark Devil Shredder. In the second volume of the anime he gets his Tiger Spirit Metal Mutant armor. He was voiced by Kiyoyuki Yanada. Shredder also made a guest appearance in an episode of the hit YouTube show Death Battle. In the episode, his weapons and abilities were analyzed against X-Men villain Silver Samurai. In the end, Shredder proved himself the better fighter and beat his opponent.

J. Divine, was an African-American spiritual leader from about 1907, until his death. His full self-given name was Reverend Major Jealous Divine, and he was also known as \\"the Messenger\\" early in his life. He founded the International Peace Mission movement, formulated its doctrine, and oversaw its growth from a small and predominantly black congregation into a multiracial and international church. Due to his ideology, many consider him to be a cult leader. Father Divine claimed to be God. He made numerous contributions toward his followers' economic independence and racial equality. He was a contemporary of other religious leaders such as Daddy Grace, Charles Harrison Mason, Noble Drew Ali, James F. Jones (also known as Prophet Jones), Wallace Fard Muhammad, and Elijah Muhammad. Life and career Prior to 1912: Early life and original name Little is known about Father Divine's early life, or even his real given name. Father Divine and the Peace Movement he started did not keep many records. Father Divine himself declined several offers to write his biography, saying that ‚Äúthe history of God would not be useful in mortal terms‚Äù. He also refused to acknowledge relationship to any family. Newspapers in the 1930s had to dig up his probable given name: George Baker. (This name is not recognized by the Library of Congress, and from 1979, there is no further use of that name as a heading for Father Divine in libraries' catalogs.)* Copy of the letter from the Library of Congress about the catalog heading for Father Divine Copy of the letter Federal Bureau of Investigation files record his name as George Baker alias \\"God\\". In 1936 Eliza Mayfield claimed to be Father Divine's mother. She stated that his real name was Frederick Edwards from Hendersonville, North Carolina, and he had abandoned a wife and five children, although Mayfield offered no proof and claimed to not remember his father's name. (Father Divine replied that \\"God has no Mother.\\") Father Divine's childhood remains a contentious point. Some, especially earlier researchers, suppose that he was born in the Deep South, most likely in Georgia, as the son of sharecroppers. Newer research by Jill Watts, based on census data, finds evidence for a George Baker Jr. of appropriate age born in an African-American enclave of Rockville, Maryland, called Monkey Run. If this theory is correct, his mother was a former slave named Nancy Baker, who died in May 1897. Most researchers agree that Father Divine's parents were freed African-American slaves. Notoriously poor records were kept about this generation of African Americans, so controversy about his upbringing is not likely to be resolved. On the other hand, he and his first wife, Peninniah (variant spellings: Penninah, Peninnah, Penniah) claimed that they were married on June 6, 1882.\\"Rumors Are Over: Father Divine Dies\\", Jet magazine, September 23, 1965, p20J. Gordon Melton, Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America (Routledge, 2014) p145\\"My Thirty Years with Father Divine\\", by Ruth Boaz, Ebony magazine (May 1965) p98 Father Divine was probably called George Baker around the turn of the century. He worked as a gardener in Baltimore, Maryland. In a 1906 sojourn in California, Father Divine became acquainted with the ideas of Charles Fillmore and the New Thought Movement, a philosophy of positive thinking that would inform his later doctrines. Among other things, this belief system asserted that negative thoughts led to poverty and unhappiness. Songwriter Johnny Mercer credited a Father Divine sermon for inspiring the title of his song \\"Accentuate the Positive\\". Father Divine attended a local Baptist Church, often preaching, until 1907, when a traveling preacher called Samuel Morris spoke and was expelled from the congregation. Morris, originally from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had a soft-spoken and uncontroversial sermon until the end, when he raised his arms and shouted, \\"I am the Eternal Father!\\" This routine had him thrown out of many churches in Baltimore, and was apparently unsuccessful until Morris happened upon the receptive Father Divine. In his late 20s, Father Divine became Morris's first follower and adopted a pseudonym, \\"The Messenger\\". The Messenger was a Christ figure to Morris's God the Father. Father Divine preached with Morris in Baltimore out of the home of former evangelist Harriette Snowden, who came to accept their divinity. Morris began calling himself \\"Father Jehovia.\\" Divine and Father Jehovia were later joined by John A. Hickerson, who called himself Reverend Bishop Saint John the Vine. John the Vine shared the Messenger's excellent speaking ability and his interest in New Thought. In 1912, the three-man ministry collapsed, as John the Vine denied Father Jehovia's monopoly on godhood, citing 1 John 4:15 to mean God was in everyone: :\\"Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and he in God.\\" Father Divine had finally parted ways with his former associates. Denying that Father Jehovia was God, and saying that not everyone could be God, he declared that he himself was God, and the only true expression of God's spirit. 1912‚Äì14: In the South Father Divine traveled south, where he preached extensively in Georgia. In 1913, conflicts with local ministers led to him being sentenced to 60 days in a chain gang. While he was serving his sentence, several prison inspectors were injured in an auto accident, which he viewed as the direct result of their disbelief. Upon his release, he attracted a following of mostly black women in Valdosta, Georgia. He taught celibacy and the rejection of gender categorizations. On February 6, 1914, several followers' husbands and local preachers had Divine arrested for lunacy. This actually expanded his ministry, with reporters and worshippers deluging his prison cell. Some whites even began calling on him. Former Mercer University professor and lay preacher, J. R. Moseley of Macon, Georgia, befriended Divine and arranged for J. B. Copeland, a Mercer alum and respected Valdosta lawyer, to represent him pro bono. Moseley was interested in what he termed \\"this unusual man\\" in his autobiography \\"Manifest Destiny.\\" Decades later, in the 1930s, Moseley met Divine in New York City when he received word that the man going by that name might in fact be the same person he met in Georgia. Father Divine was found mentally sound in spite of \\"maniacal\\" beliefs. He had given no name when arrested and was tried as \\"John Doe (alias God)\\". 1914‚Äì19: Brooklyn and marriage to Peninniah In 1914, Father Divine traveled to Brooklyn, New York, with a small number of followers and an all-black congregation. Although he claimed to be God incarnate fulfilling Biblical prophecy, he lived relatively quietly. He and his disciples formed a commune in a black middle-class apartment building. He forbade sex, alcohol, tobacco and gambling among those who were living with him. By 1919, he had adopted the name Reverend Major Jealous Divine. \\"Reverend Major\\" was chosen as a title of respect and authority, while \\"Jealous\\" was a reference to Exodus 34:14, where the Lord says he is a \\"jealous god\\" and that God's name is Jealous. His followers affectionately called him Father Divine. In this period, Father Divine was married to a follower, Peninniah (variant spellings: Penninah, Peninnah, Penniah), who was a few years older than he was. Like Father Divine, her early life is obscure, but she is believed to be from Macon, Georgia. The date of the marriage is unknown but probably occurred between 1914 and 1917. In addition to lending her dignified look to Father Divine, Peninniah served to defuse rumors of impropriety between him and his many young female followers. Both Penninah, who was often called \\"Mother Divine\\", and Father Divine would assert that the marriage was never physically consummated. 1919‚Äì31: Sayville, New York Father Divine's house in Sayville, New York. Father Divine and his disciples moved to Sayville, New York (on Long Island), in 1919. He and his followers were the first black homeowners in town. Father Divine purchased his 72 Macon Street house from a resident who wanted to spite the neighbor he was feuding with. The two neighbors, both German Americans, began fighting when one of them changed his name from Felgenhauer to Fellows in response to anti-German sentiment. His neighbor taunted him, and the feud escalated until Fellows decided to move. As a final insult, he specifically advertised his home for sale to a \\"colored\\" buyer, presumably to lower his neighbors' property value. In this period, his movement underwent sustained growth. Father Divine held free weekly banquets and helped newcomers find jobs. He began attracting many white followers as well as black. The integrated environment of Father Divine's communal house and the apparently flaunted wealth of his Cadillac infuriated neighbors. Members of the overwhelmingly white community accused him of maintaining a large harem and engaging in scandalous sex, although the Suffolk County district attorney's office found the claims baseless. In order to try to please his neighbors, he had \\"A sign posted at his driveway warned guests: NOTICE‚ÄîSmoking‚ÄîIntoxicating Liquors‚ÄîProfane Language‚ÄîStrictly Prohibited. Contrary to the charges of Sayville residents, angels claimed that Father Divine prohibited singing after eight o'clock and by ten o'clock had closed all windows and blinds.\\" Nonetheless, the neighbors continued to complain. 1931‚Äì32: Sayville arrests, trial, notoriety, and prison On May 8, 1931, a Sayville deputy arrested and charged Father Divine with disturbing the peace. Remarkable during the Depression, Father Divine submitted his $1000 bail in cash. The trial, not as speedy as the neighbors wanted, was scheduled for late fall, allowing Father Divine's popularity to snowball for the entire Sayville vacation season. Father Divine held banquets for as many as 3000 people that summer. Cars clogging the streets for these gatherings bolstered some neighbors' claims that Father Divine was a disturbance to the peace and furthermore was hurting their property values. On Sunday, November 15, at 12:15 am, a police officer was called to Father Divine's raucously loud property. By the time state troopers, deputies and prison buses were called in, a mob of neighbors had surrounded the compound. Fearing a riot, the police informed Father Divine and his followers that they had fifteen minutes to disperse. Father Divine had them wait in silence for ten minutes, and then they filed into police custody. Processed by the county jail at 3 AM, clerks were frustrated, because the followers often refused to give their usual names and stubbornly offered the \\"inspired\\" names they adopted in the movement. Seventy-eight people were arrested altogether, including fifteen whites. Forty-six pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace and incurred $5 fines, which Father Divine paid with a $500 bill, which the court was embarrassingly unable to make change from. Penninah, Father Divine, and thirty followers resisted the charges. Father Divine's arrest and heterodox doctrines were sensationally reported. The New York frenzy made this event and its repercussions the single most famous moment of Father Divine's life. Although mostly inaccurate, articles on Father Divine propelled his popularity. By December, his followers began renting buildings in New York City for Father Divine to speak in. Soon, he often had several engagements on a single night. On December 20, he spoke to an estimated 10,000 in Harlem's Rockland Palace, a spacious former basketball venue, Manhattan Casino. By May 1932, meetings were regularly held at the Rockland and throughout New York and New Jersey. Father Divine had supporters in Washington state, California and throughout the world thanks to New Thought devotees like Eugene Del Mar, an early convert and former Harlem journalist, and Henry Joerns, the publisher of a New Thought magazine in Seattle. Curiously, although the movement was predominantly black, followers outside the Northeast were mostly middle class whites. In this period of expansions, several branch communes were opened in New York and New Jersey. Father Divine's followers finally named the movement: the International Peace Mission movement. Father Divine's trial was finally held on May 24, 1932. His lawyer, Ellee J. Lovelace, a prominent Harlem African American and former US Attorney had requested the trial be moved outside of Suffolk County, due to potential jury bias. The court acquiesced, and the trial took place at the Nassau County Supreme Court before Justice Lewis J. Smith. After a long trial, with many witnesses, \\"Justice Smith instructed the jury to ignore the statements made by witnesses not present on the night of the raid. Smith's order invalidated most of the testimony in Father Divine's favor and severely crippled the defense.\\" The jury found him guilty on June 5 but asked for leniency on behalf of Father Divine. Ignoring this request, Justice Smith lectured on how Father Divine was a fraud and \\"menace to society\\" before issuing the maximum sentence for disturbing the peace: one year in prison and a $500 fine. Smith, 55, died of a heart attack days later on June 9, 1932. Father Divine was widely reported to have commented on the death, \\"I hated to do it.\\" In fact, he wrote to his followers, \\"I did not desire Judge Smith to die.‚Ä¶ I did desire that MY spirit would touch his heart and change his mind that he might repent and believe and be saved from the grave.\\" The impression that Justice Smith's death was divine retribution was perpetuated by the press, which failed to report Smith's prior heart problems and implied the death to be more sudden and unexpected than it was. During his brief prison stay, Father Divine read prodigiously, notably on the Scottsboro Nine. After his attorneys secured release through an appeal on June 25, 1932, he declared that the foundational documents of the United States of America, such as the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, were inspired. Father Divine also taught that contemporary leaders strayed from these ideals, but he would become increasingly patriotic through his life. 1932‚Äì42: Harlem The International Peace Mission movement established over 100 Heavens in the Northeastern United States. Father Divine moved to Harlem, New York, where he had accumulated significant following in the black community. Members, rather than Father Divine himself, held most deeds for the movement, but they contributed toward Father Divine's comfortable lifestyle. Purchasing several hotels, which they called \\"Heavens\\", members could live and seek jobs inexpensively. He opened one hotel \\"near Atlantic City, New Jersey, so that blacks could access the beach.\\" Father Divine, and the Peace Mission, became the largest property owners in Harlem at one point in time. The movement also opened several budget enterprises, including restaurants and clothing shops, that sold cheaply by cutting overhead. These proved very successful in the depression. Economical, cash-only businesses were actually part of Father Divine's doctrine. By 1934, branches had opened in Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, Washington, and gatherings occurred in France, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia, but the membership totals were drastically overstated in the press. Time Magazine estimated nearly two million followers, but the true figure of adherents was probably a few tens of thousands and a larger body of sympathizers who attended his gatherings. Nonetheless, Father Divine was increasingly called upon to offer political endorsements, which he initially did not. For example, New York mayoral candidates John P. O'Brien and Fiorello H. LaGuardia each sought his endorsement in 1933, but Father Divine was apparently uninterested. An odd alliance between Father Divine and the Communist Party of America began in early 1934. Although Father Divine was outspokenly capitalist, he was impressed with the party's commitment to civil rights. The party relished the endorsement, although contemporary FBI records indicate some critics of the perceived huckster were expelled from the party for protesting the alliance. In spite of this alliance, the movement was largely apolitical until the Harlem Riot of 1935. Based on a rumor of police killing a black teenager, it left four dead and caused over $1 million in property damage in Father Divine's neighborhood. Father Divine's outrage at this and other racial injustices fueled a keener interest in politics. In January 1939, the movement organized the first-ever \\"Divine Righteous Government Convention\\", which crafted political platforms incorporating the Doctrine of Father Divine. Among other things, the delegates opposed school segregation and many of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's social programs, which they interpreted as \\"handouts\\". At the zenith of Father Divine's influence, several misfortunes struck the movement. On December 16, John Hunt, a white millionaire and disciple from California calling himself John the Revelator, met the Jewett family of Denver, Colorado. He kidnapped their 17-year-old daughter Delight and took her back to California without her parents' consent. Renaming her \\"Virgin Mary\\", John the Revelator began sexual relations with her. He announced that she would give birth to a \\"New Redeemer\\" by \\"immaculate conception\\" in Hawaii. Father Divine summoned Hunt to New York, separated the couple and chastised his eccentric follower. The Jewetts, finding their daughter apparently brainwashed into believing she was literally the Virgin Mary, demanded compensation. After the movement's attorneys conducted an internal investigation, they refused. Outraged, the Jewetts offered their story to William Randolph Hearst's New York Evening Journal, an established critic of the movement. After a manhunt and trial, John Hunt was sentenced to three years and adopted a new name, the \\"Prodigal Son\\". Father Divine publicly endorsed the conviction of John the Revelator, contrary to some expectations (some followers expected him to once again \\"smite\\" the judge). However, the scandal brought bad publicity to Father Divine. News coverage implied his followers were gullible and dangerous. In March 1937, Penninah fell ill in Kingston, New York. Father Divine rarely comforted her on what was widely believed to be her deathbed. He kept running the church, only visiting her once in Kingston, again causing bad publicity. Penninah, however, claimed that she was not seriously ill or in pain. On April 20, 1937, a violent outburst occurred in a meeting when two men tried to deliver Father Divine a summons. One of the men, Harry Green, was stabbed as Father Divine fled. Father Divine went into hiding to evade authorities. During this time, one of Father Divine's most prominent followers, called Faithful Mary, defected and took control of a large commune, which was technically in her name. Of the Father she said, \\"he's just a damned man.\\" She furthermore alleged that he defrauded his followers to maintain a rich lifestyle for himself. Faithful Mary also made a number of sexual allegations, including a charge that Father Divine coerced women to have sex with key disciples. In early May, Father Divine was located and extradited from Connecticut and faced criminal charges in New York. That summer, Hearst's Metronone newsreel distributed mocking footage of Father Divine's followers singing outside police headquarters, \\"Glory, glory, hallelujah! Our God is in our land!\\" Later in May 1937, an ex-follower called Verinda Brown filed a lawsuit for $4,476 against Father Divine. The Browns had entrusted their savings with Father Divine in Sayville back in 1931. They left the movement in 1935 wishing to live as husband and wife again, but were unable to get their money back. In light of their evidence and testimony from Faithful Mary and others critical of the movement, the court ordered repayment of the money. However, this opened up an enormous potential liability from all ex-devotees, so Father Divine resisted and appealed the judgment. In 1938, Father Divine was cleared of criminal charges and Mother Divine recovered. Faithful Mary, impoverished and broken, returned to the movement. Father Divine made her grovel for forgiveness, which she did. By the late 1930s, the movement stabilized, although it had clearly passed its zenith. Father Divine's political focus on anti-lynching measures became more resolved. By 1940, his followers had gathered 250,000 signatures in favor of an anti- lynching bill he wrote. However, passage of such statutes came slowly in New York and elsewhere. The Verinda Brown lawsuit against Father dragged on and was sustained on appeal. In July, 1942, he was ordered to pay Brown or face contempt of court. Instead, Father Divine fled the state and re-established his headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He still visited New York, however. State law forbade serving subpoenas in New York on Sunday, so he often spoke on the Sabbath day in Harlem, the Promised Land (his Kingston commune), and Sayville. 1942‚Äì65: Pennsylvania After moving to Philadelphia, Father Divine's wife, Penninah, died. The exact date is not known, because Father Divine never talked about it or even acknowledged her death. However, it occurred sometime in 1943, and biographers believe Penninah's death rattled Father Divine, making him aware of his own mortality. It became obvious to Father Divine and his followers that his doctrine might not make one immortal as he asserted, at least not in the flesh. In 1944, singer/songwriter Johnny Mercer came to hear of one of Divine's sermons. The subject was \\"You got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.\\" Mercer said, \\"Wow, that's a colorful phrase!‚Äù He went back to Hollywood and got together with songwriter Harold Arlen (\\"Over The Rainbow\\"), and together they wrote \\"Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive\\", which was recorded by Mercer himself and the Pied Pipers in 1945. It was also recorded by Bing Crosby with the Andrews Sisters that same year. After his first wife died, Father Divine married a white Canadian woman called Edna Rose Ritchings in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 1946. The ceremony was kept secret even from most members until Ritching's visa expired. Critics of the movement believed that Father Divine's seemingly scandalous marriage to 21-year-old Ritchings would destroy the movement. Instead, most followers rejoiced, and the marriage date became a celebrated anniversary in the movement. To prove that he and Ritchings adhered to his doctrine on sexual abstinence, Father Divine assigned a black female follower to be her constant companion. He claimed that Ritchings, later called \\"Mother S. A. Divine\\", was the reincarnation of Penninah. Reincarnation was not previously part of Father Divine's doctrine and did not become a fixture of his theology. Followers believed that Penninah was an exceptional case and viewed her \\"return\\" as a miracle. Going into the 1950s, the press rarely covered Father Divine, and when it did, it was no longer as a menace, but as an amusing relic. For example, light-hearted stories ran when Father Divine announced Philadelphia was capital of the world and when he claimed to inspire invention of the hydrogen bomb. Father Divine's predominantly lower-class following ebbed as the economy swelled. Woodmont\\" was Father Divine's home from 1953 until his death in 1965. In 1953, follower John Devoute gave Father Divine Woodmont, a 72-acre (0.3 km¬≤) hilltop estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia. This French Gothic manor served as his home and primary site of his increasingly infrequent banquets until his death in 1965. As his health declined, he continued to petition for civil rights. In 1951, he advocated reparations to be paid to the descendants of slaves. He also argued in favor of integrated neighborhoods. However, he did not participate in the burgeoning American Civil Rights Movement because of his poor health and especially his dislike of the use of racial labels, denying he was black. On September 10, 1965, Father Divine died of natural causes at his Woodmont estate. His widow and remaining followers insist his spirit is still alive and always refer to Father Divine in the present tense. Believers keep the furnishings of Father Divine's personal rooms at Woodmont just as they were as a shrine to his life. The widow Edna Rose Ritchings became spiritual leader of the movement. In 1972, she fought an attempt by Jim Jones to take over the movement's dwindling devotees. Jones based some of his doctrines on the International Peace Mission movement and claimed to be the reincarnation of Father Divine. Although a few members of the Mission joined Peoples Temple after Jones made his play for leadership of the movement, the power push was, in terms of its ultimate objective, a complete failure. That Jones was 34 years old at the time of Father Divine's death made his claims of being a new incarnation rather hard to sustain - Jones claimed Divine's spirit had entered his body upon the passing of the elder man - and Ritchings was left unimpressed by Jones' impassioned rhetoric. Jones' custom of tape-recording all his sermons was copied from Divine, who \\"spoke\\" to his followers via archived sermon tapes once ill health forced him to cease speaking at meetings. Physical characteristics and preaching style Father Divine was a slight, black man at a diminutive . Through most of his life, he maintained a fastidious appearance and a neat moustache that he kept well groomed, his hair was invariably neatly combed, and since his days in Sayville, New York, he almost always wore a suit in public. Father Divine was said to be very charismatic. His sermons were emotionally moving and freely associated between topics. His speech was often peppered with words of his own invention like \\"physicalating\\" and \\"tangiblated\\". An attendee at a Harlem \\"kingdoms\\" meeting in the 1930s recalled that he rhythmically intoned \\"Tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions. Tens, hundreds, ... millions.' Although this seemed nonsense to the visitor, he reported that at the end the true believers chanted, \\"Yes, he's God. Yes he's God.\\" Other eccentricities were drawn from his doctrine. For example, nearly every sermon began with the greeting and exhortation \\"Peace!\\" Father Divine believed that peace should replace hello. Doctrine Father Divine preached of his divinity even before he was known as \\"Father Divine\\" in the late 1910s. His doctrine taught that his life fulfilled all Biblical prophecies about the second coming, regarding himself as Jesus Christ reborn. Father Divine also lectured that Christ existed in \\"every joint\\" of his follower's bodies, and that he was \\"God's light\\" incarnated in order to show people how to establish heaven on earth and to show them the way to eternal life. For example: Father Divine and his followers capitalized pronouns referring to him, much like \\"LORD\\" translated from the tetragrammaton is capitalized in the English Bible. Father Divine's definition of God became quite celebrated at the time because of its unusual use of language: \\"God is not only personified and materialized. He is repersonified and rematerialized. He rematerialized and He rematerialates. He rematerialates and He is rematerializatable. He repersonificates and He repersonifitizes.\\"  Positive thought  Father Divine can be considered part of the New Thought Movement; indeed, many of his white followers came from this tradition.  Welfare  Father Divine was particularly concerned with the downtrodden of society, including but not limited to Blacks. He was opposed to people accepting welfare. He believed in capitalism, and \\"In his opinion, capitalism was not at fault; the individual was to blame for the depression.\\" He thought Americans could make it better if they had positive thoughts and channeled God's spirit.  Race  Scholars disagree about whether Father Divine, an African American, was a civil rights activist, but he certainly advocated some progressive changes to race relations. For example, because he believed that every human was accorded equal rights, he believed that all members of lynch mobs ought to be tried and convicted as murderers. Father Divine's anti-lynching campaigns resonated in the black ghettos where his congregations lived, and he got over a quarter million people to sign his anti-lynching proposals.  Patriotism  Father Divine advocated that followers think of themselves as simply Americans. He believed that America was the birthplace of the \\"Kingdom of God\\", which would ultimately encompass truths of all religious principles, promoting equality and brotherhood. The Movement was supportive of the United States Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and particularly the Bill of Rights as inspired documents, believing that they outlined a more ideal life.  Communal living  Toward this life, followers of Father Divine owned and managed property collectively. The movement strove to alleviate poverty by feeding the poor and through education in written English, which the Movement believed was the \\"universal language.\\"  Chastity  Father Divine established an \\"International Modesty Code\\" which forbids smoking, drinking, and profanity. Additionally, it forbade tips, bribes, receiving presents, and \\"undue mixing of the sexes,\\" along with women wearing slacks or short skirts and men wearing short-sleeves. Although Father Divine himself was married, the movement discouraged marriage, along with any excessive mingling of the sexes. In the \\"Heavens\\" and other living spaces the Movement maintained, separate areas existed for men and women.  Thrift and Business Practices  Father Divine advocated a number of economic practices, which his followers abided by. He opposed life insurance (which converts were to cancel), welfare, social security, and credit. Thus, the Movement advocated economic self-sufficiency. His insistence that his followers refuse welfare not related to employment was estimated to have saved New York City $2 million during the Depression. Business owners in the Movement named their ventures to show affiliation with Father Divine, and obeyed all of these practices. They dealt only in cash, refusing credit in any of its forms. Each was to sell below competitor's prices while refusing any sorts of tips or gratuities. Finally, they refrained from trade in alcohol or tobacco. Legacy Civil rights Some biographers, such as Robert Weisbrot, speculate that Father Divine was a forerunner to the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s, heavily influenced by his upbringing in the segregated South. Others, such as Jill Watts, reject not only this characterization, but also the theory that Father Divine grew up in the Deep South. Watts asserts that Rockville was less oppressive than the South or even Baltimore, Maryland, and believes his civil rights positions are unintelligible without evaluating them in the context of the Doctrine of Father Divine. Religious Edna Rose Ritchings (Mother Divine) conducted services for the old and dwindling congregation until her death. The movement owns several properties, such as Father Divine's Gladwyne estate Woodmont, his former home in Sayville, New York, and the Circle Mission Church on Broad Street in Philadelphia, which also houses the movement's library. Chapters exist in Pennsylvania and possibly elsewhere, but the movement is not centralized and exists through a number of interrelated groups. In 2004, Gastronomica magazine published an article about Mother S. A. Divine and the movement's feasts. In 2000, the Divine Lorraine Hotel near Temple University on North Broad Street was sold off by the international Peace Mission Movement. It was a budget hotel with separate floors for men and women in accord with Father Divine's teachings. The Divine Tracy Hotel in West Philadelphia was sold in 2006.

Three kinds of performers take part in a bunraku performance: the Ningy≈çtsukai or Ningy≈çzukai (puppeteers), the Tay≈´ (chanters), and shamisen musicians. Occasionally other instruments such as taiko drums will be used. The most accurate term for the traditional puppet theater in Japan is . The combination of chanting and shamisen playing is called j≈çruri and the Japanese word for puppet (or dolls, generally) is ningy≈ç. It is used in many plays. Bunraku puppetry has been a documented traditional activity for Japanese people for hundreds of years. History Puppet master with female doll Scene from Date Musume Koi no Higanoko (‰ºäÈÅîÂ®òÊÅãÁ∑ãÈπøÂ≠ê) depicting Yaoya Oshichi climbing the tower Bunraku's history goes as far back as the 16th century but the origins of the modern form can be traced to the 1680s. It rose to popularity after the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653-1724) began a collaboration with the magnificent chanter Takemoto Gidayu (1651-1714), who established the Takemoto puppet theater in Osaka in 1684. Originally, the term Bunraku referred only to the particular theater established in 1805 in Osaka, which was named the Bunrakuza after the puppeteering ensemble of Uemura Bunrakuken (Ê§çÊùëÊñáÊ•ΩËªí, 1751‚Äì1810), an early 18th-century puppeteer from Awaji, whose efforts revived the flagging fortunes of the traditional puppet theatre. Elements of the form The puppets of the Osaka tradition tend to be somewhat smaller overall, while the puppets in the Awaji tradition are some of the largest as productions in that region tend to be held outdoors. The heads and hands of traditional puppets are carved by specialists, while the bodies and costumes are often constructed by puppeteers. The heads can be quite sophisticated mechanically. In plays with supernatural themes, a puppet may be constructed so that its face can quickly transform into that of a demon. Less complex heads may have eyes that move up and down, side to side or close, and noses, mouths, and eyebrows that move. Controls for all movements of parts of the head are located on a handle that extends down from the neck of the puppet and are reached by the main puppeteer inserting his or her left hand into the chest of the puppet through a hole in the back of the torso. The main puppeteer, the omozukai, uses his right hand to control the right hand of the puppet, and uses his left hand to control the puppet's head. The left puppeteer, known as the hidarizukai or sashizukai, depending of the tradition of the troupe, manipulates the left hand of the puppet with his or her own right hand by means of a control rod that extends back from the elbow of the puppet. A third puppeteer, the ashizukai, operates the feet and legs. Puppeteers begin their training by operating the feet, then move on to the left hand, before being able to train as the main puppeteer. Many practitioners in the traditional puppetry world, particularly those in the National Theater, describe the long training period, which often requires ten years on the feet, ten years on the left hand, and ten years on the head of secondary characters before finally developing the requisite skills to move to the manipulation of the head of a main character, as an artistic necessity. However, in a culture like that of Japan, which privileges seniority, the system can also be considered a mechanism to manage competition among artistic egos and provide for a balance among the demographics of the puppeteers in a troupe in order to fill each role. All but the most minor characters require three puppeteers, who perform in full view of the audience, generally wearing black robes. In most traditions, all puppeteers also wear black hoods over their heads, but a few others, including the National Bunraku Theater, leave the main puppeteer unhooded, a style of performance known as dezukai. The shape of the puppeteers' hoods also varies, depending on the school to which the puppeteer belongs. Usually a single chanter recites all the characters' parts, altering his vocal pitch and style in order to portray the various characters in a scene. Occasionally multiple chanters are used. The chanters sit next to the shamisen player. Some traditional puppet theaters have a revolving platform for the chanter and shamisen player, which rotates bringing replacement musicians for the next scene. The shamisen used in bunraku is slightly larger than other kinds of shamisen and has a different sound, lower in pitch and with a fuller tone. Bunraku shares many themes with kabuki. In fact, many plays were adapted for performance both by actors in kabuki and by puppet troupes in bunraku. Bunraku is particularly noted for lovers' suicide plays. The story of the forty-seven r≈çnin is also famous in both bunraku and kabuki. Bunraku is an author's theater, as opposed to kabuki, which is a performer's theater. In bunraku, prior to the performance, the chanter holds up the text and bows before it, promising to follow it faithfully. In kabuki, actors insert puns on their names, ad-libs, references to contemporary happenings and other things which deviate from the script. The most famous bunraku playwright was Chikamatsu Monzaemon. With more than 100 plays to his credit, he is sometimes called the Shakespeare of Japan. Bunraku companies, performers, and puppet makers have been designated \\"Living National Treasures\\" under Japan's program for preserving its culture. Today National Bunraku Theater in Osaka Osaka is the home of the government-supported troupe at National Bunraku Theatre. The National Bunraku Theater offers five or more shows every year, each running for two to three weeks in Osaka before moving to Tokyo for a run at the National Theater. The National Bunraku Theater also tours within Japan and occasionally abroad. Until the late 1800s there were also hundreds of other professional, semi-professional, and amateur troupes across Japan that performed traditional puppet drama. Since the end of World War II, the number of troupes has dropped to fewer than 40, most of which perform only once or twice a year, often in conjunction with local festivals. A few regional troupes, however, continue to perform actively. The Awaji Puppet Troupe, located on Awaji Island southwest of Kobe, offers short daily performances and more extensive shows at its own theater and has toured the United States, Russia and elsewhere abroad. The Tonda Puppet Troupe (ÂÜ®Áî∞‰∫∫ÂΩ¢ÂÖ±ÈÅäÂõ£) of Shiga Prefecture, founded in the 1830s, has toured the United States and Australia on five occasions and has been active in hosting academic programs in Japan for American university students who wish to train in traditional Japanese puppetry. The Imada Puppet Troupe, which has performed in France, Taiwan, and the United States, as well as the Kuroda Puppet Troupe are located in the city of Iida in Nagano Prefecture. Both troupes, which trace their histories back more than 300 years, perform frequently and are also active in nurturing a new generation of traditional puppeteers and expanding knowledge of puppetry through training programs at local middle schools and by teaching American university students in summer academic programs at their home theaters. The increase in interest in Bunraku puppetry has contributed to the establishment of the first traditional Japanese puppet troupe in North America. Since 2003, Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe, currently based at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, has performed at venues around the United States, including the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as in Japan. They have also performed alongside the Imada Puppet Troupe. The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia has an extensive variety of Bunraku puppets in their Asian collection. Asian Collection at the Center for Puppetry Arts  Music and song  Tayu and shamisen player The chanter/singer (tayu) and the shamisen player provide the essential music of the traditional Japanese puppet theater. In most performances only a shamisen player and a chanter perform the music for an act. Harmony between these two musicians determines the quality of their contribution to the performance.An Introduction to Bunraku, Japan Arts Council, The Chanter and the Shamisen Player The role of the tayu is to express the emotions and the personality of the puppets. The tayu performs not only the voices of each of the characters, but also serves as the narrator of the play. Located to the side of the stage the tayu physically demonstrates facial expressions of each character while performing their respective voices. While performing multiple characters simultaneously the tayu facilitates the distinction between characters by exaggerating their emotions and voices. This is also done to maximize the emotional aspects for the audience. In bunraku the futo-zao shamisen which is the largest shamisen as well as that of the lowest register, is employed. The instruments most frequently used are flutes, in particular the shakuhachi, the koto and various percussion instruments. Puppets Close-up of a male puppet's head with mechanical eyes. This particular puppet is a head used in Sanbaso performances.  The head  The heads of the puppets (kashira) are divided into categories according to gender, social class and personality. Certain heads are created for specific roles, others can be employed for several different performances by changing the clothing and the paint. The heads are in effect repainted and prepared before each presentation.An Introduction to Bunraku, Japan Arts Council, The Puppet's Head An Introduction to Bunraku, Japan Arts Council, Making the Puppet's Head The preparation of the hair constitutes an art in and of itself. The hair distinguishes the character and can also indicate certain personality traits. The hair is made from human hair, however yak tail can be added to create volume. The ensemble is then fixed on a copper plate. To ensure that the puppet head is not damaged, the finishing of the hairstyle is made with water and bee's wax, not oil.An Introduction to Bunraku, Japan Arts Council, The Puppet's Wig  Costumes  Female Puppet wearing a headdress and colourful kimono The costumes are designed by a costume master and are composed of a series of garments with varying colors and patterns. These garments typically include a sash and a collar as well as an under robe (juban), an inner kimono (kitsuke), a vest (haori) or an outer robe (uchikake). In order to keep the costumes soft they are lined with cotton.An Introduction to Bunraku, Japan Arts Council, The Puppet's Costumes As the clothing of the puppets wear out or are soiled the clothing is replaced by the puppeteers. The process of dressing or redressing the puppets by the puppeteers is called koshirae.  Construction  A doll's skeletal structure is simple. The carved wooden kashira is attached to the head grip, or dogushi, and thrust down an opening out of the puppet's shoulder. Long material is draped over the front and back of the shoulder board, followed by the attachment of cloth. Carved bamboo is attached to create the hips of the puppet, arms and legs are tied to the body with lengths of rope. There is no torso to the puppet, as it would merely block out the puppeteer's range of movement of the individual limbs. The isho, or costume of the doll is then sewn on to cover over any cloth, wooden or bamboo parts that the artist doesn't wish to be seen. Finally, a slit is created in the back of the costume in order for the chief puppeteer to firmly handle the dogushi head stick.  Text and the puppets  Unlike kabuki, which emphasizes the performance of the main actors, bunraku simultaneously demonstrates elements of presentation (directly attempting to invoke a certain response) and representation (trying to express the ideas or the feelings of the author). In this way attention is given to both visual and musical aspects of the puppets as well as the performance and the text. Every play begins with a short ritual in which the tayu, kneeling behind a small but ornate lectern, reverentially lifts his or her copy of the script to demonstrate devotion to a faithful rendering of the text. The script is presented at the beginning of each act as well.  Performers  Despite their complex training the puppeteers originated from a very destitute background. The kugutsu-mawashi were itinerants and as a result were treated as outcasts by the educated, richer class of Japanese society at the time. As a form of entertainment, the men would operate small hand puppets and put on miniature theatre performances, while women were often skilled in dancing and magic tricks which they used to tempt travelers to spend the night with them. The whole environment that gave birth to these puppet shows is reflected in the themes. Stage The musician's stage (Yuka) This is the auxiliary stage upon which the gidayu-bushi is performed. It juts out into the audience area at the front right area of the seats. Upon this auxiliary stage there is a special rotating platform. It is here that the chanter and the shamisen player make their appearance, and, when they are finished, it turns once more, bringing them backstage and placing the next performers on the stage. The partitions (Tesuri) and the pit (Funazoko) In the area between upstage and downstage, there are three stage positions, known as \\"railings\\" (tesuri). Located in the area behind the second partition is often called the pit and it is where the puppeteers stand in order to carry out the puppets' lifelike movements. Small Curtain (Komaku) and Screened-off Rooms (Misuuchi) This stage looks from an angle of the audience, the right side is referred to as the kamite (stage left), while the left side is referred to as the shimote (stage right). The puppets are made to appear and then leave the stage through the small black curtains. The blinded screens are just above these small curtains, and they have special blinds made from bamboo so that the audience cannot see inside.  Large Curtain (Joshiki-maku)  The joshiki-maku is a large, low hanging curtain hanging off of a ledge called the san-n-tesuri. It is used to separate the area where the audience is sitting from the main stage. The puppeteers stood behind the joshiki-maku, holding their puppets above the curtain while being hidden from the audience. However, the dezukai practice established later in the Bunraku form would let the actors be seen on stage moving with the puppets, nulling the use of the curtains.

Key figures were Ernest M. Skinner (1866‚Äì1960), Arthur Hudson Marks (1875‚Äì1939), Joseph Silver Whiteford (1921-1978), and G. Donald Harrison (1889‚Äì1956). The company was formed from the merger of the Skinner Organ Company and the pipe organ division of the √Üolian Company in 1932. Skinner period The Skinner & Cole Company was formed in 1902 as a partnership of Ernest Skinner and Cole, another former Hutchings-Votey employee. By 1904 the partnership had dissolved, and the \\"Ernest M. Skinner & Company\\" purchased the Skinner and Cole assets, in the form of the contract for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Holy Trinity in New York CityOpus 113, 1904 Holy Trinity Lutheran Church Organ History (Accessed 25 Dec 2010) from the former company for $1. Between 1904 and 1910, the firm produced approximately 30 instruments, including several new instruments of Skinner's design, in the 60- to 80-stop size range. By 1912 the firm had perfected the \\"Pitman Windchest\\" to a state of simple technical elegance. (A \\"wind chest\\" is the large box, normally built of wood, upon which the sound producing pipes are \\"planted\\", and which contains the valves and mechanisms which control the wind supply to the pipes.) The Pitman chest allows the air to be held constantly pressurized, directly at the valves located beneath each of the thousands of pipes, which increases responsiveness to the player, and eliminates noise and other problems found with the \\"Ventil\\"-style chests, which apply wind only when a stop is drawn. Virtually all major builders of electro-pneumatic action organs, including M. P. M√∂ller, W. W. Kimball (both firms now defunct), Schantz, and Reuter, use some form of the Pitman windchest to this day, although most have only recently begun to credit Skinner with the design and subsequent refinements that make it an industry benchmark. The 1928, Opus 750 at Missouri United Methodist Church in Columbia, Missouri was a favorite of organist James Thomas Quarles. Skinner also developed and perfected numerous parts of the \\"actions\\" for the instruments, as well as the Whiffletree Shade Motor, a mechanical device that moves the expression shades in a smooth, fluid motion without the \\"slam\\" that often accompanies mechanical expression shade controls. This allowed the instruments to provide quick and responsive control of the expression (volume) levels of the different parts of the instrument. In 1914 the Skinner Organ Factory company moved into a new factory building in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston at Crescent Avenue and Sydney Street.\\"Dorchester Illustration of the Day no. 1757 Skinner Organ\\", Dorchester Historical Society, April 5, 2012Whitney, Craig R., All the Stops: The Glorious Pipe Organ and Its American Masters, PublicAffairs, Perseus Books Group, 2004. Cf. p.65  Harrison period  G. Donald Harrison joined the Skinner firm in July 1927, and slowly began to influence how Skinner organs were built. After several years of conflict between Ernest Skinner and Arthur Marks, Harrison was appointed Vice-President and Tonal Director of √Üolian- Skinner in 1933. The company‚Äôs tonal philosophy continued to turn from the romantic-style orchestral instruments built under the direction of Skinner to a classically eclectic style. Organists began to look to the past to find direction for the future, and in doing so they found that they were in sympathy with the ideas being developed by Harrison. These ideas included the provision of smaller-scaled diapasons, along with more higher-pitched and mutation stops in place of large-scaled unison diapasons, color reeds and flutes. During Harrison's tenure from 1933 until his death in 1956 (while doing tonal finishing on the organ at St. Thomas Church, New York City, which was completed by Arthur Birchall after Harrison's death), the tonal design of √Üolian-Skinner organs changed a great deal, but retained and perfected many of Ernest Skinner's mechanical innovations. The company used Skinner's Pitman windchest, for example, throughout its existence. Also the high quality and distinctive design details of the √Üolian-Skinner console were preserved.

Whiteford was appointed President. Whiteford joined the company in 1948 and had distinguished himself through research in the field of musical acoustics as it relates to church music. Under his direction, √Üolian-Skinner built pipe organs for five of the foremost symphony orchestras in America. His love for vocal music led him to emphasize the role of the organ in accompanying singing. He had a charismatic personality that was well suited to the prestige of the √Üolian-Skinner name. In fact, his personal involvement secured major contracts that were directly commissioned without competing bids. His tonal work was not without criticism, including from within the company- e.g. Donald Gillett's unhappiness with Whiteford's \\"string quartet Greats\\". For more information see Dr Charles Callahan's book Aeolian-Skinner Remembered. Notable instruments from the Whiteford period include: *Detroit: Ford Auditorium (1957, III/71). Currently dismantled. The theater will be demolished. The organ will be installed in St. Aloysius Catholic Church in downtown Detroit. *Westminster, Maryland: Baker Memorial Chapel (1958)\\"Bishop Oxnam to Speak at Chapel Dedication\\", Enoch Pratt Library vertical file, Baltimore Evening Sun, April 2, 1958 *Independence, Missouri: RLDS Auditorium (1959, IV/113) *Honolulu: St. Andrew's Cathedral (1960, IV/72) *Ypsilanti, Michigan: Eastern Michigan University Pease Auditorium (1960).

Removed and incorporated into the Crystal Cathedral (now Christ Cathedral) organ, Garden Grove, California. After the Whiteford's resignation in 1966, John J. Tyrell, Donald M. Gillett, and Robert L. Sipe served as president until the company ceased operations in 1972.  Aeolian-Skinner Records  Beginning in 1954, Aeolian-Skinner produced a series of LP records titled The King of Instruments. These LPs are devoted to the tone and history of the modern organ. Volume 1, The American Classic Organ, contains a descriptive discussion written over both sides of the LP cover by Tyler Turner and Joseph Whiteford on the beginnings of the American classic organ. The five recorded sections on the record, with G. Donald Harrison as narrator describing the five selections, are \\"I-Principles\\", \\"II-Flutes\\", \\"III-Strings\\", \\"IV-Reeds\\", and \\"V-Mixtures and Mutations\\".

Trefethen, Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice (SIAM, 2012). Online: https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/ATAP/ In numerical analysis, Chebyshev nodes are specific real algebraic numbers, namely the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. They are often used as nodes in polynomial interpolation because the resulting interpolation polynomial minimizes the effect of Runge's phenomenon.Fink, Kurtis D., and John H. Mathews. Numerical Methods using MATLAB. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1999. 3rd ed. pp. 236-238. Definition Zeros of the first 50 Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind For a given positive integer n the Chebyshev nodes in the interval (‚àí1, 1) are :x_k = \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2k-1}{2n}\\\\pi\\\\right), \\\\quad k = 1, \\\\ldots, n. These are the roots of the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of degree n. For nodes over an arbitrary interval [a, b] an affine transformation can be used: :x_k = \\\\frac{1}{2} (a + b) + \\\\frac{1}{2} (b - a) \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2k-1}{2n}\\\\pi\\\\right), \\\\quad k = 1, \\\\ldots, n. Approximation The Chebyshev nodes are important in approximation theory because they form a particularly good set of nodes for polynomial interpolation. Given a function ∆í on the interval [-1,+1] and n points x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots , x_n, in that interval, the interpolation polynomial is that unique polynomial P_{n-1} of degree at most n-1 which has value f(x_i) at each point x_i. The interpolation error at x is :f(x) - P_{n-1}(x) = \\\\frac{f^{(n)}(\\\\xi)}{n!} \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (x-x_i) for some \\\\xi (depending on x) in [‚àí1, 1]., (20.3) So it is logical to try to minimize :\\\\max_{x \\\\in [-1,1]} \\\\left \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (x-x_i) \\\\right. This product is a monic polynomial of degree n. It may be shown that the maximum absolute value (maximum norm) of any such polynomial is bounded from below by 21‚àín. This bound is attained by the scaled Chebyshev polynomials 21‚àín Tn, which are also monic. (Recall that Tn(x) ‚â§ 1 for x ‚àà [‚àí1, 1]., Lecture 20, ¬ß14) Therefore, when the interpolation nodes xi are the roots of Tn, the error satisfies :\\\\leftf(x) - P_{n-1}(x)\\\\right \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{2^{n - 1}n!} \\\\max_{\\\\xi \\\\in [-1,1]} \\\\leftf^{(n)} (\\\\xi)\\\\right. For an arbitrary interval [a, b] a change of variable shows that :\\\\leftf(x) - P_{n-1}(x)\\\\right \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{2^{n - 1}n!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{b-a}{2}\\\\right)^n \\\\max_{\\\\xi \\\\in [a,b]} \\\\leftf^{(n)} (\\\\xi)\\\\right.

It included all the Cyclades (except Mykonos and Tinos). In 1537 it became a tributary of the Ottoman Empire, and was annexed by the Ottomans in 1579; however, Christian rule survived in islands such as Siphnos (conquered by the Ottomans in 1617) and Tinos (conquered in 1715). Background and establishment of the Duchy The Italian city states, especially the Republic of Genoa, Pisa, and the Republic of Venice, had been interested in the islands of the Aegean long before the Fourth Crusade. There were Italian trading colonies in Constantinople and Italian pirates frequently attacked settlements in the Aegean in the 12th century. After the collapse and partitioning of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, in which the Venetians played a major role, Venetian interests in the Aegean could be more thoroughly realized. The Duchy of the Archipelago was created in 1207 by the Venetian nobleman Marco Sanudo, a participant in the Fourth Crusade and nephew of the former Doge Enrico Dandolo, who had led the Venetian fleet to Constantinople. This was an independent venture, without the consent of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders. Sanudo was accompanied by Marino Dandolo and Andrea and Geremia Ghisi (as well as Filocalo Navigajoso, possibly). He arranged for the loan of eight galleys from the Venetian Arsenal, set anchor in the harbor of Potamides (now Pyrgaki, in the southwest of Naxos), and largely captured the island. The Naxiotes continued to resist, however, and established a base inland, around the fortress of Apalyros/Apalire. The latter fell to Sanudo after a five or six weeks' siege, despite the assistance rendered to the Greeks by the Genoese, Venice's main competitors. With the entire island occupied in 1210, Sanudo and his associates soon conquered Melos and the rest of the islands of the Cyclades, and he established himself as Duke of Naxia, or Duke of the Archipelago, with his headquarters on Naxos. Sanudo rebuilt a strong fortress and divided the island into 56 provinces, which he shared out as fiefs among the leaders of his men, most of whom were highly autonomous and apparently paid their own expenses. Navigaojso had been granted his island domain by Henry of Flanders and was technically vassal of the Latin Empire; Sanudo himself recognized the Latin Empire's authority rather than making the Duchy a vassal of Venice. The conqueror himself ruled for twenty years (1207‚Äì27). He held in his personal possession Paros, Antiparos, Milos, Sifnos, Kythnos, Ios, Amorgos, Kimolos, Sikinos, Syros, and Pholegandros. Sanudo's fellow crusaders conquered lordships of their own, sometimes as vassals of Sanudo like Dandolo for Andros. Although they are often considered to have become Sanudo's vassals as well,cf. Longnon (1969), p. 239 the Ghisi brothers, who held Tinos, Mykonos, and the Northern Sporades (Skiathos, Skyros, Skopelos) never recognized the suzerainty of Sanudo. Instead, like him they were directly vassals of the Latin Emperors.Setton (1976), p. 19 note 78 Some families thought earliercf Longnon (1969), pp. 238‚Äì239, basing himself on the works of Karl Hopf to have settled at this time in the islands were in fact established later, in the 14th century (Barozzi etc) or the 15th (Querini).Louise Buenger Robbert, Venice and the Crusades in A History of the Crusades vol.V p 432, citing the works of Silvano Borsari and of R-J Loenertz Further south, Kythera (or Cerigo), held by Marco Venier, and Antikythera (or Cerigotto), held by Jacopo Viaro chose to become vassals of Venice.Longnon (1969), p. 239 Administration, faith and economics The Duchy of Naxos and states in the Morea, carved from the Byzantine Empire, as they were in 1265 (William R. Shepherd, Historical Atlas, 1911) The institution of European feudalism caused little disruption to the local islanders who were familiar with the rights of a landowner class under the Byzantine system of the pronoia. The significant legal distinctions between the Byzantine pronoia and feudalism were of little immediate consequence to those who farmed the land or fished the waters in question. In most cases, the local population submitted relatively peacefully to the authority of their new Venetian lords. Sanudo and his successors prudently followed a conciliatory course with their Byzantine subjects, granting even fiefs to certain among them, in an effort to bind them to the dynasty. The Venetians brought the Catholic Church with them, but, as they were a minority of habitually absentee landowners, most of the population remained Greek Orthodox. Marco Sanudo himself established a Latin archbishopric on Naxos, but in contrast to his successors, did not attempt to forcibly convert the Greek Orthodox majority. These moves consisted primarily in imposing restrictions on Orthodox clergy and the exclusion of Orthodox Christians from positions of authority. The islands were of great importance in Venetian grand strategy, with their valuable trade routes to Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean, which the Venetians could now control; Aside from providing safe traveling routes to Venetian ships, the Venetians also exported to Venice corundum and marble, which they mined on Naxos. Certain Latin feudal rights survived in the island of Naxos and elsewhere until they were abrogated in 1720 by the Ottomans. Later history The Annals of the Latin Archipelago center on the family histories of Sanudo and Dandolo, Ghisi, Crispo, and Sommaripa, Venier and Quirini, Barozzi and Gozzadini. Twenty-one dukes of the two dynasties ruled the Archipelago, successively as vassals of the Latin Emperors at Constantinople, of the Villehardouin dynasty of princes of Achaea, of the Angevins of the Kingdom of Naples (in 1278), and after 1418 of the Republic of Venice. In 1248,R-J Loenertz, Les seigneurs tierciers de N√©grepont, Byzantion, vol. 35, 1965, re-edited in Byzantina et Franco-Graeca : series altera p 152. The date of 1236, proposed by Hopf without justification, has been rejected by Longnon in Probl√®mes de l'histoire de la principaut√© de Mor√©e, Journal des savants (1946) pp. 149-150. the Duchy was nominally granted to William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. Marco II Sanudo lost many of the islands, except Naxos and Paros, to the forces of the renewed Byzantine Empire under the admiral Licario in the late 13th century. The Byzantine revival was to prove short-lived though, as they relinquished control of their gains in 1310. In 1317 the Catalan Company raided the remnants of the Duchy; in 1383, the Crispo family led an armed insurrection and overthrew Sanudo's heirs as Dukes of Archipelago. Under the Crispo dukes, social order and agriculture decayed, and piracy became dominant. Collapse and Ottoman conquest Eastern Mediterranean in 1450 Before the last Latin Christian duke, Jacopo IV Crispo, was deposed in 1566 by Ottoman Sultan Selim II, he was already paying the Sultan tribute. The Sultan's appointed representative, the last Duke of Archipelago (1566‚Äì79) was a Portuguese Jew (Marrano), Joseph Nasi. Latin Christian rule was not entirely removed after that date: the Gozzadini family in Bologna survived as lords of Siphnos and other little islands in the Cyclades until 1617, and the island of Tenos remained Venetian until 1714. The last Venetian ports in Morea (the Peloponnese) were captured in 1718. Gaspar Graziani, a Dalmatian nobleman, was awarded the title of Duke of the Archipelago in 1616, but the island was again under direct Ottoman rule at the end of 1617; he was the last to hold the title. Legacy and influence Today, Cyclades islands such as Syros and Tinos have some entirely Catholic villages and parishes, while many Greeks from the Cyclades have surnames with a distinctly Italo-Venetian origin e.g. Venieris, Ragousis, Dellaportas, Damigos etc. Dukes of the Archipelago Sanudo Tower, Chora of Naxos Sanudo dynasty *Marco I Sanudo (1207‚Äì27) *Angelo (1227‚Äì62) *Marco II (1262‚Äì1303) *Guglielmo I (1303‚Äì23) *Niccol√≤ I (1323‚Äì41) *Giovanni I (1341‚Äì62) *Fiorenza (1362‚Äì71) *Niccol√≤ II (1364‚Äì71) *Niccol√≤ III dalle Carceri (1371‚Äì83) Crispo dynasty *Francesco I Crispo (1383‚Äì97) *Giacomo I (1397‚Äì1418) *Giovanni II (1418‚Äì33) *Giacomo II (1433‚Äì47) *Gian Giacomo (1447‚Äì53) *Guglielmo II (1453‚Äì63) *Francesco II (1463) *Giacomo III (1463‚Äì80) *Giovanni III (1480‚Äì94) (interregnum) *Francesco III (1500‚Äì11) (interregnum) *Giovanni IV (1517‚Äì64) *Giacomo IV (1564‚Äì66)  Ottoman representative  *Joseph Nasi (1566‚Äì79) See also * Byzantine Greece References Sources  * * Archipelago, Duchy of Category:Territories of the Republic of Venice Category:Frankokratia Category:History of Naxos Category:Paros Category:States and territories established in 1207 Category:1200s establishments in the Byzantine Empire Category:1579 disestablishments in Europe Category:Island countries Category:1207 establishments in Europe ","title":"Duchy of the Archipelago"},{"id":"647502","text":"World War I poster in the Library of Congress The term comrade is used to mean 'mate', 'colleague', or 'ally', and derives from the Spanish term ,Camarade - Acad√©mie fran√ßaise literally meaning 'chamber mate', from Latin , meaning 'chamber' or 'room'.

Background  Upon abolishing the titles of nobility in France, and the terms and (literally, 'my lord' and 'my lady'), the revolutionaries employed the term for men and for women (both meaning 'citizen') to refer to each other. The deposed King Louis XVI, for instance, was referred to as to emphasize his loss of privilege. When the socialist movement gained momentum in the mid-19th century, socialists elsewhere began to look for a similar egalitarian alternative to terms like \\"Mister\\", \\"Miss\\", or \\"Missus\\". In German, the word had long been used as an affectionate form of address among people linked by some strong common interest, such as a sport, a college, a profession (notably as a soldier), or simply friendship. The term was often used with political overtones in the revolutions of 1848, and was subsequently borrowed by French and English. In English, the first known use of the word comrade with this meaning was in 1884 in the socialist magazine Justice.  Russian and Soviet usage  In the late 19th century Russian Marxists and other leftist revolutionaries adopted as a translation of the word the Russian word for () (from Old Turkic ; abbreviated ), whose original meaning was \\"business companion\\" or \\"travel (or other adventure) mate\\", deriving from the noun (, 'merchandise').Anrede \\"Genosse\\" nicht mehr zeitgem√§√ü as a form of address in international (especially German) social democracy and in the associated parts of the labour movement. For instance, one might be referred to as or Chairman, or simply as . After the Russian Revolution, translations of the term in different languages were adopted by communists worldwide. However, due to its common usage in portrayals of the Soviet Union in Cold War films and books, the term became most strongly associated in public consciousness with communism as known in the Soviet Union, even though many other socialists would continue to use Comrade among themselves (e.g., German and Austrian social-democrats and, to this day, members of the British Labour Party). In the early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks used when addressing or referring to people assumed sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as members of the Communist party (and originally of other pro-revolution leftist formations such as the Left Socialist- Revolutionaries) and people from the \\"working masses\\". The more neutral republican form of address would translate as Citizen. Accordingly, supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War would use mockingly as a derogatory term for their enemies ‚Äì although at the same time, the various socialist anti-Bolshevik forces such as the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Mensheviks also used among themselves. By the mid-1920s, the form of address became so commonplace in the Soviet Union that it was used indiscriminately in essentially the same way as terms like \\"Mister\\" and \\"Sir\\" are employed in English. That use persisted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Still, the original meaning partly re-surfaced in some contexts: criminals and suspects were only addressed as \\"citizens\\" and not as , and expressly refusing to address someone as would generally be perceived as a hostile act or, in Stalinist times, even as an accusation of being \\"Anti- Soviet\\". The term Comrade is not used in Russian society, and the term is not often used in contemporary society, but it is still the standard form of address in the Russian Armed Forces and Police of Russia, where officers and soldiers are normally addressed as Colonel, General, Sergeant, or the like. The term is also used as part of idioms, for example: ('fellow-sufferer', from German ) or ([war] buddy), or as a part of such words as (partnership) that do not associate with communism.  Chinese usage  In Chinese, the translation of comrade is (), literally meaning '(people with) the same spirit, goal, ambition, etc.'. It was first introduced in the political sense by Sun Yat-sen to refer to his followers. The (Nationalist Party), which was co-founded by Sun Yat-Sen, has a long tradition of using this term to refer to its members, usually as a noun rather than a title; for example, a KMT member would say \\"Mr. Chang is a loyal and reliable comrade ().\\"See, for example, the remarks of Frank Hsieh after losing the Republic of China presidential election in 2008: ÂáùËÅöÈª®ÂÖßÂúòÁµê Ë¨ùÈï∑Âª∑ÔºöÊàëÊ±∫ÂÆöÁïôÂà∞‰∫î‰∫å‰∫î : \\"ÂæàÂ§öÂêåÂøóÂ∏åÊúõÊàëËÉΩÂ§†ÁïôÂà∞‰∫îÊúà‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•\\" (\\"Many comrades hoped that I could stay to May 25\\".

Nevertheless, the term was promoted most actively by the Communist Party of China during its struggle for power. It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in mainland China after the People's Republic of China was founded. For example, women were ('female comrade'), children were ('little comrade') and seniors were ('old comrade'). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese and members of the Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity. At party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained. Officials often address each other as , and thus the usage here is not limited to Communist Party members alone. In addition, is the term of preference to address any national leader when their titles are not attached (e.g., Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping). In October 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive urging all 90 million party members to keep calling each other \\"comrades\\" instead of less egalitarian terms. It is also in the regulations of the Chinese Armed Forces as one of three appropriate ways to formally address another member of the military (\\"comrade\\" plus rank or position, as in \\"Comrade Colonel\\", or simply \\"comrade/s\\" when lacking information about the person's rank, or talking to several servicepeople.) The SAR territories of Hong Kong and Macau generally use as a catch-all term to refer to members of the LGBT community; its use as a word for \\"comrade\\" has historically been uncommon due to both territories formerly being under foreign administrations. This definition of is becoming increasingly popular among mainland Chinese youth and a growing number of older Chinese people have stopped using due to its new association with the LGBT community.  South African usage  During the 1970s and 1980s, comrade emerged as a popular revolutionary form of address in South Africa among those involved in anti-apartheid political activities. For example, members of the African National Congress and South African Communist Party frequently referred to each other as comrade. Among poor residents of the country's segregated townships, it was also used to specifically denote members of militant youth organisations. These radical activists led consumer boycotts, organised anti-apartheid rallies and demonstrations, and intimidated those suspected of having ties to the South African government or security forces. In this particular context, the English title comrades was also used interchangeably with the Xhosa term . Zimbabwean usage In Zimbabwe, the term is used for persons affiliated with the ZANU (PF) political party. The state media also use Cde as short for comrade. Members of other political parties mainly the Movement for Democratic Change are often referred by their names or Mr, Mrs or Prof. The revived Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) members also call themselves comrades.  South Sudanese usage  Members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army call each other 'Comrade'.  Internet Culture usage  As aforementioned, the usage of the word comrade has resurfaced within internet culture. References to usage of \\"Comrade\\" can be connected with commentary upon communism and communistic symbols.  British Fascist Usage  The British Union of Fascists used the word commonly to refer to members, which was controversial. The Marching Song, set to the music of the began 'Comrades, the voices'.

Randall, defended the usage of the word by stating that 'comrades' ‚Äòfittingly and completely expresses the ideal of unity in the service of a common cause‚Äô  In other languages  *In Albanian, the word (meaning friend, from Latin ) was used within communist circles. *The Arabic word () (meaning comrade, companion) is used in Arabic, Urdu and Persian with the same political connotation as \\"comrade.\\" The term is used both among Arab communists as well as within the Ba'ath movement and the Lebanese Forces.

In 19th century Czech, it was a poetic word, meaning 'fellow'. As elsewhere in Europe, the term was originally introduced by the Czech Social Democrats and subsequently carried over to Czech Communists as well when these split off from the Social Democrats. After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like , (\\"Mister\\", \\"Madam\\") and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context.

The Faculty  The Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen is Denmark's largest law school, and one of the largest in Northern Europe, with approximately 4000 law students. One of the main objectives of the Faculty is to intensify contacts with foreign universities and law schools. These contacts have greatly increased in recent years. They include such activities as encouraging research and studies abroad, international student exchanges, faculty exchanges and a developing programme for visiting scholars. The Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen has existed since 1479 when the University was founded. The instituting statute founding the Faculty is still preserved in the archives of the Danish Royal Library. The University of Copenhagen is the largest university in Scandinavia and the only Scandinavian university ranked among the top 50 universities worldwide. The Faculty of Law of the Royal Frederick University in Norway, established in 1811 as the second law faculty in then-Denmark-Norway, was based on the curriculum of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Law and retained strong similarities until recently. The Faculty's research covers a wide range of topics. Additionally, the Faculty has a number of research centres: * CECS: Centre for Comparative and European Constitutional Studies * Centre for Pension Law * Centre for Studies in Legal Culture * FOCOFIMA - Forum for Company Law and Financial Market Law * WELMA - Legal Studies in Welfare and EU Market Integration * Centre for Information and Innovation Law (CIIR) * iCourts - The Danish National Research Foundation's Centre of Excellence for International Courts  Seal  The seal of the faculty contains the following text { :Sigillum Facultatis Iuridic√¶ :Universitatis Hafniensis  :Seal of the Faculty of Law :The University of Copenhagen } which is written in a circle around a lindworm above which is a sceptre and a sword. The lindworm symbolizes the struggle against evil, while the sceptre is the power of the state and the sword is justice. The seal is based on the seal given to the Faculty by the King in 1531.  Law Programmes  The Faculty of Law offers 4 different degrees { :LLB :LLM  :Master in Mediation and Conflict Resolution :PhD } The second degree of the law programme (LLM) takes a minimum of two years to complete. In Danish, the degree, which is awarded after a minimum of five years' of undergraduate and graduate studies, is called the candidatus or candidata juris, commonly shortened to cand.jur. This degree is equivalent to a master's degree. The official length of the programme is 120 ECTS Credits. The PhD course is a three-year researcher training course. During this period the Ph.D. student must attend courses, acquire teaching experience and take part in the research environment at other universities. Admission is on an individual basis and subject to an overall evaluation of the project and personal qualifications of the applicant. Only a limited number of applicants are accepted, depending on the financial resources available and other criteria such as counselling facilities. The most important aspect of the PhD course of studies is the preparation of a written thesis that forms the basis of the award of a PhD degree after an oral public defence (viva). Subject to academic merit PhD theses are published by the publishing house Jurist- og √òkonomforbundets Forlag. The master in Mediation and Conflict Resolution is part of the Faculty's continuing education programme.

Contents The Germania begins with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the Germanic people (chapters 1‚Äì27); it then describes individual tribes, beginning with those dwelling closest to Roman lands and ending on the uttermost shores of the Baltic, among the amber-gathering Aesti, the Fenni, and the unknown tribes beyond them. Tacitus says (chapter 2) that physically, the Germanic peoples appear to be a distinct nation, not an admixture of their neighbors, since nobody would desire to migrate to a climate as horrid as that of Germania. They are divided into three large branches, the Ingaevones, the Irminones, and the Istaevones, deriving their ancestry from three sons of Mannus, son of Tuisto, their common forefather. In chapter 4, he mentions that they all have common physical characteristics, blue eyes (truces et caerulei oculi = \\"sky-coloured, azure, dark blue, dark green\\"), reddish hair (rutilae comae = \\"red, golden-red, reddish yellow\\"), and large bodies, vigorous at the first onset but not tolerant of exhausting labour, tolerant of hunger and cold, but not of heat or thirst.unde habitus quoque corporum, tamquam in tanto hominum numero, idem omnibus: truces et caerulei oculi, rutilae comae, magna corpora et tantum ad impetum valida. [3] laboris atque operum non eadem patientia, minimeque sitim aestumque tolerare, frigora atque inediam caelo solove adsueverunt. In chapter 7, Tacitus describes their government and leadership as somewhat merit-based and egalitarian, with leadership by example rather than authority, and punishments are carried out by the priests. He mentions (chapter 8) that the opinions of women are given respect. In chapter 11, Tacitus describes a form of folk assembly rather similar to the public Things recorded in later Germanic sources: in these public deliberations, the final decision rests with the men of the tribe as a whole. Tacitus further discusses the role of women in chapters 7 and 8, mentioning that they often accompany the men to battle and offer encouragement. He says that the men are often highly motivated to fight for the women because of an extreme fear of losing them to captivity. Tacitus says (chapter 18) that the Germans are mainly content with one wife, except for a few political marriages, and specifically and explicitly compares this practice favorably to other barbarian cultures, perhaps since monogamy was a shared value between Roman and Germanic cultures. He also records (chapter 19) that adultery is very rare, and that an adulterous woman is shunned afterward by the community regardless of her beauty. In chapter 45, Tacitus mentions that the tribe to the north of the Germans, the Sitones, \\"resemble [the Suevi Scandinavians] in all respects but one - woman is the ruling sex.\\" \\"This,\\" Tacitus comments, \\"is the measure of their decline, I will not say below freedom, but even below decent slavery.\\" The latter chapters of the books describe the various Germanic tribes, their relative locations, and some of their characteristics. Many of the tribes named correspond with other (and later) historical records and traditions, while the fate of others is less clear. Purpose and sources Tacitus Ethnography had a long and distinguished heritage in classical literature, and the Germania fits squarely within the tradition established by authors from Herodotus to Julius Caesar. Tacitus himself had already written a similar--albeit shorter--essay on the lands and tribes of Britannia in his Agricola (chapters 10‚Äì13). The work can appear moralizing at points, perhaps implicitly comparing the values of Germanic tribes and those of his Roman contemporaries, although a direct comparison between Rome and Germania is not explicitly presented in the text. In writing the work, Tacitus might have wanted to stress the dangers that the Germanic tribes posed to the Empire. Tacitus' descriptions of the Germanic character are at times favorable in contrast to the opinions of the Romans of his day. He holds the strict monogamy and chastity of Germanic marriage customs worthy of the highest praise, in contrast to what he saw as the vice and immorality rampant in Roman society of his day (chapter 18), and he admires their open hospitality, their simplicity, and their bravery in battle. All of these traits were highlighted perhaps because of their similarity to idealized Roman virtues. One should not, however, think that Tacitus' portrayal of Germanic customs is entirely favorable; he notes a tendency in the Germanic people for what he saw as their habitual drunkenness, laziness, and barbarism, among other traits. The ethnonym Germani as used by Tacitus does not necessarily coincide with the modern linguistic definition of Germanic peoples as any people speaking a Germanic language, and the details of the classification Germani have been debated in scholarship, e.g. the possibility that the Batavians may therefore have been Celtic-speaking. Tacitus nevertheless shows no lack of precision in stating that the Nervii are not actually Germanic as they claim to be (chapter 28). He also notes in chapter 43 that a certain tribe called the Cotini actually speaks a Gallic tongue, and likewise the Osi speak a Pannonian dialect. Tacitus himself had never travelled in the Germanic lands; all his information is second-hand at best. Ronald Syme supposed that Tacitus closely copied the lost Bella Germaniae of Pliny the Elder, since the Germania is in some places outdated: in its description of the Danubian tribes, says Syme, \\"they are loyal clients of the Empire ... Which is peculiar. The defection of these peoples in the year 89 during Domitian's war against the Dacians modified the whole frontier policy of the Empire.\\"Syme, Tacitus (Oxford: 1958), p. 128 While Pliny may have been the primary source, scholars have identified others; among them are Caesar's Gallic Wars, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Posidonius, Aufidius Bassus, and numerous nonliterary sources, presumably based on interviews with traders and soldiers who had ventured beyond the Rhine and Danube borders, and Germanic mercenaries in Rome. Willem and Joan Blaeu), 1645, based on information from Tacitus and Pliny Reception One of the minor works of Tacitus, Germania was not widely cited or used before the Renaissance. In antiquity, Lucian appears to imitate a sentence from it.. It was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages. In the West, it was cited by Cassiodorus in the sixth century and used more extensively by Rudolf of Fulda in the ninth. In the East, it was used by the anonymous author of the Frankish Table of Nations in the early sixth century and possibly by the Emperor Maurice in his Strategikon later that century. In the ninth century, the Frankish Table was incorporated into the Historia Brittonum, which ensured a wide diffusion to at least some of the Germania's information.. Guibert of Nogent, writing his autobiography around 1115, quotes Germania. Germania survives in a single manuscript that was found in Hersfeld Abbey (Codex Hersfeldensis) in 1425. This was brought to Italy, where Enea Silvio Piccolomini, later Pope Pius II, first examined and analyzed the book. This sparked interest among German humanists, including Conrad Celtes, Johannes Aventinus, and Ulrich von Hutten and beyond. The peoples of medieval Germany (the Kingdom of Germany in the Holy Roman Empire) were heterogenous, separated in distinct tribal kingdoms, such as the Bavarians, Franconians, and Swabians, distinctions which remain evident in the German language and culture after the unification of Germany in 1871 (aside from Austria) and the establishment of modern Austria and Germany. During the medieval period, a self-designation of \\"Germani\\" was virtually never used; the name was only revived in 1471, inspired by the rediscovered text of Germania, to invoke the warlike qualities of the ancient Germans in a crusade against the Turks. Ever since its discovery, treatment of the text regarding the culture of the early Germanic peoples in ancient Germany remains strong, especially in German history, philology, and ethnology studies, and to a lesser degree in Scandinavian countries, as well. Beginning in 16th-century German humanism, German interest in Germanic antiquity remained acute throughout the period of Romanticism and nationalism. A scientific angle was introduced with the development of Germanic philology by Jacob Grimm. Because of its influence on the ideologies of Pan-Germanism and Nordicism, Jewish- Italian historian Arnaldo Momigliano in 1956 described Germania and the Iliad as \\"among the most dangerous books ever written\\".Anthony Birley, ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô, in Tacitus, Agricola and Germany (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. xxxviii. Christopher Krebs, a professor at Stanford University, claims in a 2012 study that Germania played a major role in the formation of the core concepts of Nazi ideology.Christopher B. Krebs, A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus‚Äôs Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich (New York: W.W. Norton, 2012), p. 22. The mainstream German reception is much less sensationalist and sees Tacitus's description as more patronizing than laudatory, a predecessor of the classical noble savage concept which started in the 17th and 18th centuries in western European literature.Paradies auf Erden?: Mythenbildung als Form von Fremdwahrnehmung : der S√ºdsee-Mythos in Schl√ºsselphasen der deutschen Literatur Anja Hall K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 2008  Codex Aesinas The Codex Aesinas is believed to be portions of the Codex Hersfeldensis ‚Äì the lost Germania manuscript brought to Rome from Hersfeld Abbey. It was rediscovered in 1902 by priest-philologist Cesare Annibaldi in the possession of Count Aurelio Balleani of Iesi. Temporarily transferred to Florence for the controls at the state body of the fine arts, the manuscript was severely damaged during the 1966 flood. It was later restored and brought back to Iesi, and in 1994, the Codex Aesinas was given to the National Library in Rome, catalogued as Cod. Vitt.

The bill was passed by the 43rd United States Congress and signed into law by United States President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875. The act was designed to \\"protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights\\", providing for equal treatment in public accommodations and public transportation and prohibiting exclusion from jury service. It was originally drafted by Senator Charles Sumner in 1870, but was not passed until shortly after Sumner's death in 1875. The law was not effectively enforced, partly because President Grant had favored different measures to help him suppress election-related violence against blacks and Republicans in the South. The Reconstruction era ended with the resolution of the 1876 presidential election, and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last federal civil rights law enacted until the passage of Civil Rights Act of 1957. In 1883, the Supreme Court ruled in the Civil Rights Cases that the public accommodation sections of the act were unconstitutional, saying Congress was not afforded control over private persons or corporations under the Equal Protection Clause. Parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later re-adopted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, both of which cited the Commerce Clause as the source of Congress's power to regulate private actors. Legislative history The drafting of the bill was performed early in 1870 by United States Senator Charles Sumner, a dominant Radical Republican in the Senate, with the assistance of John Mercer Langston, a prominent African American who established the law department at Howard University. The bill was proposed by Senator Sumner and co-sponsored by Representative Benjamin F. Butler, both Republicans from Massachusetts, in the 41st Congress of the United States in 1870. Congress removed the coverage of public schools that Sumner had included. The act was passed by the 43rd Congress in February 1875 as a memorial to honor Sumner, who had just died.Hoffer (2010), p. 121 It was signed into law by United States President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875. Enforcement President Grant had wanted an entirely different law to help him suppress election-related violence against blacks and Republicans in the South. Congress did not give him that, but instead wrote a law for equal rights to public accommodations that was passed as a memorial to Grant's bitterest enemy, the late Senator Charles Sumner.Smith (2002), pp. 566-68 Grant never commented on the 1875 law, and did nothing to enforce it says historian John Hope Franklin.Franklin (1974), pp. 225-35 Grant's Justice Department ignored it and did not send copies to US attorneys, says Franklin, while many federal judges called it unconstitutional before the Supreme Court shut it down. Franklin concludes regarding Grant and Hayes administrations, \\"The Civil Rights Act was never effectively enforced.\\" Franklin (1974), p. 235 Public opinion was opposed, with the black community in support.Gillette (1982), p. 201 Historian Rayford Logan looking at newspaper editorials finds the press was overwhelmingly opposed.Logan (1997), p. 173-175 Case law The Supreme Court, in an 8‚Äì1 decision, declared sections of the act unconstitutional in the Civil Rights Cases on October 15, 1883. Justice John Marshall Harlan provided the lone dissent. The Court held the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination by the state and local government, but it does not give the federal government the power to prohibit discrimination by private individuals and organizations.Gerber and Friedlander (2008) The Court also held that the Thirteenth Amendment was meant to eliminate \\"the badge of slavery,\\" but not to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last federal civil rights bill signed into law until the Civil Rights Act of 1957, enacted during the Civil Rights Movement. Legacy The Civil Rights Act of 1875 is notable as the last major piece of legislation related to Reconstruction that was passed by Congress during the Reconstruction era. These include the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the four Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868, the three Enforcement Acts of 1870 and 1871, and the three Constitutional Amendments adopted between 1865 and 1870. Provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later readopted by Congress during the Civil Rights Movement as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The 1964 and 1968 acts relied upon the Commerce Clause contained in Article One of the Constitution of the United States rather than the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Faculty educates students in the areas of Human Health and Medical Sciences, Oral Health Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science. History The official seal of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, featuring the Rod of Asclepius. It was designed by Pete Burke and first taken into use on September 1, 2004. The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen was established in its current form in 1992 from the merging of K√∏benhavns Tandl√¶geh√∏jskole (The Dental School of Copenhagen) and Det L√¶gevidenskabelige Fakultet (The Medical Faculty). The School of Medical Sciences' history dates back to 1479, when the University of Copenhagen was founded. The University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine was founded in 1814 as a de facto Norwegian (partial) continuation of the medical faculty in Copenhagen, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars and the breakup of Denmark-Norway by the foreign powers. The medical faculty in Oslo therefore shared many of its traditions with the Copenhagen faculty. In 1842 the Faculty of Medicine and the Kirurgisk Akademi (Academy of Surgery) were merged to form the Faculty of Medical Science. An integration of the health education programs was discussed in the late 1970s, and a decade later, the Faculty of Medical Science and the School of Dentistry were merged to form the Faculty of Health Sciences. Buildings built during this time period include the Panum Building. As of January 2016, Panum is the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences' largest building complex and houses six of the Faculty‚Äôs thirteen departments. In 2005, the Center for Health and Society (Danish: Center for Sundhed og Samfund, abbr. CSS) was opened in the former Copenhagen Municipal Hospital in central Copenhagen. As of January 2016, the CSS houses most of the Department of Public Health and the School of Global Health. The School of Oral Health Sciences operates under the Department of Odontology. Its history dates back the early 1890s, when Denmark's first school of dentistry was founded on Nygade. The school moved its location twice, first in 1894 to Stormgade where the facilities were shared with the Teachers College and a school museum, and in 1928 to Trommesalen. In 1941, the school moved to newly constructed facilities on Jagtvej and changed its name to the School of Dentistry (Tandl√¶geh√∏jskolen). During the 1980s, the School of Dentistry was merged into the University of Copenhagen and moved to the recently erected Panum Building. The former School of Dentistry was merged with the university's Faculty of Medical Science to form the Faculty of Health Sciences, and was renamed as the Central Department of Odontology (Odontologisk Centralinstitut). It consisted of two scientific and one clinical section. In the early 1990s, a revision of the dental education program resulted in 60% joint courses with the medical program. In 1993, a new university law was passed and the Department of Odontology received its current designation. The School of Pharmaceutical Sciences' history dates back to 1892, when the Pharmaceutical College (Den Farmaceutiske L√¶reanstalt) was founded on Stockholmsgade. In 1942, the Pharmaceutical College moved into a new building at University Park and changed its name to the Danish Pharmaceutical College (Danmarks Farmaceutiske H√∏jskole). In 2003, the Danish Pharmaceutical College was renamed as the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science (Danmarks Farmaceutiske Universitet). In 2007, the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science was merged into the University of Copenhagen and was renamed as the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. In 2012, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences and the veterinary part of the Faculty of Life Sciences to form the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. In January 2007, the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University was merged into the University of Copenhagen and was renamed as the Faculty of Life Sciences. This was later split up, with the veterinary part merging with the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences to form the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the rest merging into the Faculty of Science. The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences received its current name when the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the veterinary part of the Faculty of Life Sciences were merged in 2012.The Panum Building Departments As of January 2019, the faculty houses thirteen departments.

After that he studied in Birmingham till 1986. The notable international appearances he made were in the TV shows of Ruby Wax, Clive James, Jeremy Clarkson and in the British satirical programme Have I Got News for You (on series 9) in 1995. A year later he became a panelist in the successful Dutch version of the same show: Dit was het nieuws. Raoul, and his brother Eric, founded comedyclub Toomler and Comedytrain, the stand-up comedy collective that introduced stand- up comedy in the Netherlands in the year 1990. In 2007 he is one of the members of The Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective. Heertje also wrote columns voor Het Parool. His father is the well-known economist Arnold Heertje. Comedytrain Comedytrain was the first stand-up comedy collective in the Netherlands. It was founded in 1990 by Raoul Heertje. Comedy club Toomler in Amsterdam is its home theatre. The word Comedytrain is a combination of comedy and training. Its main goal was to give talented comedians, who did not succeed at once in making an hour and a half one-man show, a place to perform and develop, to try out, fail and succeed; to evaluate others and be evaluated by them. Over the years Comedytrain has become the home of famous Dutch comedians, like Hans Teeuwen, Theo Maassen, Najib Amhali, Hans Sibbel, Thomas Acda, Ronald Goedemondt, Jan Jaap van der Wal, and Sanne Wallis de Vries. Comedytrain is still a place where young comedians find a stage for developing as performers. Twice a year auditions are held for new talents to enter Comedytrain. The comedians do not only play the Toomler stage weekly, but also tour the Dutch theatres together, perform for companies and parties and play the many stages in theatre caf√©'s and bars all over the country.

The title is taken from the Song of Solomon 8:7: \\"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. If a man were to give all his wealth for love, it would be utterly scorned.\\" The principal characters of the story are Sandy and Dennys Murry, twin brothers who are somewhat out of place in the context of the multifarious and eccentric Murry family from A Wrinkle in Time. The action of the story follows that of A Wind in the Door but precedes the climactic, apocalyptic event in A Swiftly Tilting Planet. Plot summary In the middle of a New England winter, identical twin brothers Sandy and Dennys accidentally disturb an experiment in their parents' laboratory and are teleported to a sandy desert. There, they are acquired by water-prospector 'Japheth' and guided to an oasis, but Dennys is separated from the others. Sandy remains with Japheth and his elderly grandfather Lamech; there, Sandy is cured of heatstroke by a variety of improbable beings, including seraphim. Dennys reappears in another tent and is thrown into a refuse heap. He later comes under the care of a friendly family in the center of the oasis, headed by a gruff but kindly patriarch called Noah. It soon becomes apparent that the boys have been interpolated into the story of Noah's Ark, shortly before the Flood. Both Noah and Lamech receive mysterious instructions from God (known as El) concerning the building of the Ark. The twins come to understand that unicorns who can traverse space and time live in the oasis. Sinister supernatural beings known as the nephilim distrust the twins, and their human wives attempt to gather information about them. At several points, the wife of a nephil unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Sandy. Separated for much of the book, the twins become more independent of each other and gain maturity over the course of a year in the desert. Both are in love with Noah's beautiful and virtuous daughter Yalith (and she with them), but neither twin declares his affection until the very end of the novel. Dennys convinces Noah to reconcile with his father, Lamech, and both twins eventually care for Lamech's gardens while he lies ill. After Lamech's death, Sandy is kidnapped, but is eventually found by Japheth. Suspense arises when it becomes clear that there is no place on the Ark reserved for Sandy, Dennys, or Yalith. After both twins assist in the construction of the Ark, Yalith is taken by the seraphim to the presence of El. Sandy and Dennys are then returned to their own time and place by unicorns summoned by the seraphim. Major themes The story largely concerns the teenaged twins' emotional coming of age, but, like the other three novels about the Murry family, includes elements of fantasy and Christian theology such as the seraphim, a heavenly race of angels and the nephilim, a race of giants that were the result of the mating of mortal women and angels are the main antagonists of the story (see Genesis 6:1-4 ).Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), p. 181. Author Donald R. Hettinga notes that the world of Noah's oasis is especially difficult for \\"the empirically minded twins\\" to accept because in L'Engle's theology of \\"a gradual Fall\\", it is still populated by manticores and unicorns, \\"everyone can still see angels,\\" and some people \\"can still converse intimately with God.\\" Similarities to the fantasy-science fiction works of C. S. Lewis, always present in L'Engle's oeuvre, are particularly notable here. The twins' difficulty in believing in things that exist outside their empiricist world is a trait they must overcome in the story, because it is only by believing in a \\"virtual unicorn\\" that they can obtain transportation back to their everyday world. Biblical and other sources of immortal character names Although previous books in the series touched on themes of Christian theology, Many Waters makes direct references to Biblical and Qabalistic mysticism, particularly in its supernatural characters. While A Wind in the Door featured a \\"singular cherubim\\" with the fabricated name of Proginoskes, many of the seraphim and nephilim are named after obscure mystical entities: Seraphim The Seraphim are angels, although the text declines to explicitly name them as such even when asked directly. They serve as protectors, healers, and advisors, and form special friendships with pious people. They have wings colored in gold, silver or blue. Each has a preferred animal form, often mammals or birds, although some appear even as reptiles and insects. They regard the Nephilim as their brothers, in spite of the schism between them. * Adnarel, originally one of the leaders who follow the four leaders who divide the four parts of the year in the Book of Enoch 82:14. * Aariel, variant of Ariel, \\"lion of God\\". The name occurs with some frequency in the Old Testament and in rabbinical literature. (Note that Aariel frequently appears in the novel in the form of a lion.) * Abasdarhon, originally the angel who rules over the fifth hour of the night. The name also appears in the Steganographia of Johannes Trithemius. * Abdiel, a seraph in the Sepher Raziel and a character in Milton's Paradise Lost. * Akatriel, one of the Angels of Presence. * Achsah, wife of Othniel in the Old Testament. Curiously, this seraph is named after a mortal character. * Admael, one of the seven angels set over the earth. * Adabiel is mentioned in the alt.magick Kabbalah FAQKabbalah FAQ (Version: 3.0 Release Date: February 1996).

Nephilim The Nephilim seem to be fallen angels who can't return to heaven, although they claim to have willingly chosen to leave paradise for the sake of material pleasures. They are lusty hedonists who seduce young women with their beauty and riches. They have wings and eyes colored in violets and reds. They often take the form of insects, reptiles, and desert scavengers. They have adversarial attitudes toward the Seraphim. * Ugiel, second of the unholy sefirot according to Moses de Burgos. * Rofocale, after Lucifuge Rofocale, governor of Hell in The Sworn Book of Honorius. * Eisheth, an angel of prostitution and the consort of the demon Samael. * Eblis, variant of Iblis, the primary devil in Islam. * Estael is named as an intelligence of Jupiter in The Secret Grimoire of Turiel, purportedly a sixteenth-century grimoire. * Negarsanel, variant of Nasargiel, an angel of Hell according to The Legends of the Jews by Rabbi Louis Ginzberg. * Rugziel, a fallen angel. * Rumael, twentieth of the twenty-one named fallen angels in 1 Enoch 69. * Rumjal, sixth named of the fallen angels in 1 Enoch 69. * Ertrael, another fallen angel named in 1 Enoch. * Naamah, another consort of Samael. Reception Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"the kind of intricate tale with complex characters and relationships that L'Engle's readers have come to expect... A carefully wrought fable, entwining disparate elements from unicorns to particle physics, this will be enjoyed for its suspense and humor as well as its other levels of meaning.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Newbery Medal-winning author Susan Cooper wrote, \\"Analogies between the Flood and the possibility of nuclear destruction are suggested from time to time, but no didactic conclusion is forced out of them... Miss L'Engle is above all a skillful storyteller, and every admirer of 'A Wrinkle in Time' will have fun with 'Many Waters.'\\" Series notes Many Waters is an anomaly among the books of the Time Quintet. Meg and Charles Wallace Murry, the protagonists of the other three books, only appear on the last two pages of this one, while Sandy and Dennys, usually minor characters, are fully developed. Written after A Swiftly Tilting Planet, it nevertheless takes place about five years before that book, and about five years after A Wrinkle in Time. If one reads the books in the order of internal chronology, Many Waters thus interrupts the saga of Meg and Charles Wallace for a side trip with the \\"ordinary\\" members of the Murry family. Since the story was not written before Planet was published, the latter book does not fully take into account the twins' expanded understanding of the world beyond the everyday, instead showing some continued skepticism on their part. However, this aspect of their character is less extreme than in earlier books. For the twins, being immersed in Noah's world \\"stretches their sense of reality\\". Sandy and Dennys appear to retain this change in attitude as adults, particularly in A House Like a Lotus, in which Sandy acts as a mentor to his eldest niece, Polly O'Keefe. In the previous book in the series, A Wind in the Door, Meg is informed that Sandy and Dennys will become \\"Teachers\\", a metaphoric role that they appear to play as adults because of their experiences in Many Waters. However, An Acceptable Time, the fifth book in the so-called Time Quintet (the Time Quartet plus the final novel about Polly), does not include the twins as either skeptics or teachers.

He was a pioneer of modern transpersonal astrology. Biography Dane Rudhyar was born in Paris on March 23, 1895. At the age of 12, a severe illness and surgery disabled him, and he turned to music and intellectual development to compensate for his lack of physical agility. He studied at the Sorbonne, University of Paris (graduating at the age of 16), and at the Paris Conservatoire. His early ventures into philosophy and his association with the artistic community in Paris led to his conviction that all existence is cyclical in character. Influenced by Nietzsche as a youth, Rudhyar visioned himself as a \\"seed man\\" of new age cultural evolution. In November 1916, Rudhyar's music brought him to New York City, where his orchestral arrangements and original compositions were performed on April 4, 1917 at a performance of M√©tachorie by the New York Metropolitan Opera. This was one of the first polytonal pieces of music performed in the United States. He also met Sasaki Roshi, one of the early Japanese Zen teachers in America, who led him in the study of Oriental philosophy and occultism. During this period from 1917 to 1919, spent partly in New York City, partly in Canada, and partly in Philadelphia he adopted the name \\"Rudhyar\\" a cognate of several attractive Sanskrit words including the name of the god Rudra. His interest was further stimulated by his association with Theosophy, which began when he was asked to compose music for a production at the society's headquarters in Los Angeles in 1920. Rudhyar became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1926. He stayed in California (often commuting to New York) through the 1920s and in 1930 married Marla Contento, secretary to independent Theosophist Will Levington Comfort. Comfort introduced Rudhyar to Marc Edmund Jones, who in turn introduced him to astrology. Rudhyar received mimeographed lessons on astrology from Jones. Rudhyar learned astrology during a period when he was also studying the psychological writings of Carl G. Jung, and he began to think in terms of bringing astrology and Jungian psychology together. Rudyar also cites Jan Smut's book Holism and Evolution as an influence. The marriage between astrology and depth-psychology overcame some basic problems, including astrology's deterministic approach to life and the trouble of designating an agreeable agent to produce the astrological effects. Rudhyar postulated that the stars did not cause the effects seen in human life but were pictures synchronistically aligned to human beings. They detailed psychological forces working in individuals, but did not override human freedom in responding to those forces, he said. At first he called his new interpretation \\"harmonic astrology\\" and as the ideas matured renamed it \\"humanistic astrology,\\" the subject of his monumental volume, The Astrology of Personality, published in 1936. A friend, Theosophist Alice A. Bailey (the person who invented the term New Age), encouraged the development of his thought and published his book on her press, Lucis Publishing. His initial writings were regular articles in Paul Clancy's magazine American Astrology and Grant Lewi's Horoscope Magazine. Over the next two decades Rudhyar continued to write and lecture on astrology, but while he was honored within the astrological community he was little known outside of it. It was not until the 1970s, as the New Age movement emerged, that major publishing houses discovered him and began to publish his writings: among the first was The Practice of Astrology, published in 1970 by Penguin Books. In 1969 Rudhyar founded the International Committee for Humanistic Astrology, a small professional society that would work on the development of his perspective. He began one of the most fruitful periods of his life, turning out several books a year for the next decade. He began to absorb the insights of transpersonal psychology, which concentrated on exploring altered and exalted states of perception, and by the mid-1970s had moved beyond humanistic astrology to what he termed \\"transpersonal astrology.\\" He also began to reflect upon the New Age movement and wrote several of the more sophisticated volumes on planetary consciousness and New Age philosophy.Melton, J. Gordon, Jerome Clark, and Aidan A. Kelly New Age Encyclopedia Detroit:1990 Gale Research Dane Rudhyar died September 13, 1985, in San Francisco, California. Astrological writings Most of Rudhyar's more than forty books and hundreds of articles concern astrology and spirituality. The book that established his reputation in the astrological field was his first on the subject, The Astrology of Personality (1936). Arguing that astrology is not essentially predictive but rather productive of intuitive insights, The Astrology of Personality was one of the most influential tracts of \\"free-will\\" astrology, despite being written in the dense, circuitous style that characterizes much of Rudhyar's writing. Rudhyar's astrological works were influential in the New Age movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially among the hippies of San Francisco, where he lived and gave frequent lectures. Rudhyar regarded the 'true early hippies' as potential harbingers of a New Age. In 1967 the scene reached its peak in the‚Ä¶Summer of Love in San Francisco.\\"Rudhyar, Dane The Astrology of America's Destiny: A Birth Chart for the United States of America New York: 1974 Random House Page 173 Most notably, Dane Rudhyar predicted in 1972 that the Age of Aquarius would begin in 2062.Rudhyar, Dane Astrological Timing: The Transition to the New Age New York: 1972 Harper & Row Fiction novels Dane Rudhyar also wrote several novels: When Cosmic Love Awakens ‚Äì A Transpersonal Love Story, by Dane Rudhyar was written and published in 1952. Story synopsis: There was a conjunction of Venus and Mars on Valentine's Day 1951. On that day two men and a woman who worked at a New York City science fiction magazine office met a Mr. Ramar, who showed them how to travel to the planets within. When Cosmic Love Awakens: Rania ‚Äì An Epic Narrative, by Dane Rudhyar, was written in 1930 and first published in 1973. Story synopsis: It is the intense and dramatic story of the evolution of a woman's soul. Rania's tortuous search for spiritual growth sustains her in her final battle with the Powers of Darkness. Rania: Return from No Return (subtitled 'A Paraphysical Novel'), by Dane Rudhyar, was also first published in 1973. Story synopsis: Set in a 22nd-century Earth with a unified world government intent on peaceful space exploration, a poetic astronaut agrees to undertake a physically perilous mission to travel beyond an outer-region threshold that has disintegrated all previous explorers. He intends to report back to Earth (to his wife on Earth) via telepathic communication methods that they have spent time scientifically preparing. As the book jacket says: \\"...Return from No Return weaves the drama of a global crisis, an intense love story, and profound esoteric truths into a powerful and suspenseful novel.\\" Rudhyar, Dane Return from No Return Palo Alto: 1973 The Seed Center Transcendental art Dane Rudhyar joined the Transcendental Painting Group in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1938 and 1939. The idea behind transcendental painting and drawing was to paint or draw images of Jungian archetypes. Transcendental painting may be considered a cousin of surrealist art and a precursor of the cosmic art of the 1950s,Piper, Raymond F. and Lila K. Cosmic Art New York:1975 Hawthorn Press. (Contains a transcendental art drawing by Dane Rudhyar) the psychedelic art of the 1960s, and the visionary art of the 1970s. Throughout his career, Dane Rudhyar continued to paint and draw new transcendental artwork, or use artwork he had previously painted, to illustrate his pamphlets and books about astrology.

Rudhyar's own compositions tend to employ dissonant harmony, emphatically not of a systematic variety such as Charles Seeger's‚ÄîRudhyar was philosophically opposed to such a rigid approach. His musical thought was influenced by Henri Bergson and theosophy, and he viewed composers as mediums, writing that \\"the new composer\\" was \\"no longer a 'composer,' but an evoker, a magician. His material is his musical instrument, a living thing, a mysterious entity endowed with vital laws of its own, sneering at formulas, fearfully alive.\\" Rudhyar's most distinctive music is for piano, including his Tetragram (1920‚Äì67) and Pentagram (1924‚Äì26) series, Syntony (1919‚Äì24, rev. 1967), and Granites (1929). His works are almost all composed of brief movements‚Äîhe felt that length and its attendant structural demands led to abstraction and away from the sensuous physicality of sound. He influenced several early-20th- century composers including Ruth Crawford and Carl Ruggles, as well as members of the group centered around Henry Cowell known as the \\"ultra-modernists.\\" Cowell paid homage to him with a solo piano piece, A Rudhyar (1924). Late in his life, Rudhyar's musical work was rediscovered by the composers James Tenney and Peter Garland, who declared that Rudhyar's \\"best works occurred in the 1920s and...1970s!!!\\" References Further reading *Dane Rudhyar: His Music, Thought, and Art a new biography by Deniz Ertan published in 2009 by the University of Rochester Press. *Kirkpatrick, John, et al.

Scatter/gather refers to the process of gathering data from, or scattering data into, the given set of buffers. Vectored I/O can operate synchronously or asynchronously. The main reasons for using vectored I/O are efficiency and convenience. Vectored I/O has several potential uses: * Atomicity: if the particular vectored I/O implementation supports atomicity, a process can write into or read from a set of buffers to or from a file without risk that another thread or process might perform I/O on the same file between the first process' reads or writes, thereby corrupting the file or compromising the integrity of the input * Concatenating output: an application that wants to write non-sequentially placed data in memory can do so in one vectored I/O operation. For example, writing a fixed-size header and its associated payload data that are placed non-sequentially in memory can be done by a single vectored I/O operation without first concatenating the header and the payload to another buffer * Efficiency: one vectored I/O read or write can replace many ordinary reads or writes, and thus save on the overhead involved in syscalls * Splitting input: when reading data held in a format that defines a fixed-size header, one can use a vector of buffers in which the first buffer is the size of that header; and the second buffer will contain the data associated with the header Standards bodies document the applicable functions \`readv\`readv in the Single Unix Specification and \`writev\`writev in the Single Unix Specification in POSIX 1003.1-2001 and the Single UNIX Specification version 2. The Windows API has analogous functions \`ReadFileScatter\` and \`WriteFileGather\`; however, unlike the POSIX functions, they require the alignment of each buffer on a memory page.ReadFileScatter in MSDN Library Winsock provides separate \`WSASend\` and \`WSARecv\` functions without this requirement. While working directly with a vector of buffers can be significantly harder than working with a single buffer, using higher-level APIs Vstr the Vectored String API for working efficiently can mitigate the difficulties.  Examples  The following example prints \\"Hello, Wikipedia Community!\\" to the standard output. Each word is saved into a single buffer and with only one call to \`writev()\`, all buffers are printed to the standard output. #include #include #include #include #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { const char buf1[] = \\"Hello, \\"; const char buf2[] = \\"Wikipedia \\"; const char buf3[] = \\"Community! \\"; struct iovec bufs[] = { { .iov_base = (void *) buf1, .iov_len = sizeof buf1 - 1 }, { .iov_base = (void *) buf2, .iov_len = sizeof buf2 - 1 }, { .iov_base = (void *) buf3, .iov_len = sizeof buf3 - 1 }, }; if (-1  writev(STDOUT_FILENO, bufs, sizeof bufs / sizeof *bufs)) { perror(\\"writev()\\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } return EXIT_SUCCESS; }  References  Category:Input/output ","title":"Vectored I/O"},{"id":"647575","text":"WGEM may refer to: * WGEM-TV, a television station (channel 10) licensed to Quincy, Illinois, United States * WGEM (AM), a radio station (1440 AM) licensed to Quincy, Illinois, United States * WGEM-FM, a radio station (105.1 FM) licensed to Quincy, Illinois, United States ","title":"WGEM"},{"id":"647581","text":"The Bioinformatics Centre is an interdisciplinary research in bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH).

The machine gun typically required a six to eight-man team to operate: one fired, one fed the ammunition, the rest helped to carry the weapon, its ammunition, and spare parts. Not to be confused with the Maxim machine gun, it was in service from before the First World War until the 1960s, with air-cooled versions of it on many Allied World War I fighter aircraft. The weapon had a reputation for great solidity and reliability. Ian V. Hogg, in Weapons & War Machines, describes an action that took place in August 1916, during which the British 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps fired their ten Vickers guns continuously for twelve hours. Using 100 barrels, they fired a million rounds without a failure. \\"It was this absolute foolproof reliability which endeared the Vickers to every British soldier who ever fired one.\\" \\"The Vickers gun accompanied the BEF to France in 1914, and in the years that followed, proved itself to be the most reliable weapon on the battlefield...\\" History A Vickers machine gun crew in action at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, September 1917 The Vickers machine gun was based on the successful Maxim gun of the late 19th century. After purchasing the Maxim company outright in 1896, Vickers took the design of the Maxim gun and improved it, inverting the mechanism as well as reducing its weight by lightening and simplifying the action and using high strength alloys for certain components. A muzzle booster was also added. The British Army formally adopted the Vickers gun as its standard machine gun under the name Gun, Machine, Mark I, Vickers, .303-inch on 26 November 1912. There were still great shortages when the First World War began, and the British Expeditionary Force was still equipped with Maxims when sent to France in 1914. Vickers was, in fact, threatened with prosecution for war profiteering, due to the exorbitant price it was demanding for each gun. As a result, the price was slashed. As the war progressed, and numbers increased, it became the British Army's primary machine gun, and served on all fronts during the conflict. When the Lewis Gun was adopted as a light machine gun and issued to infantry units, the Vickers guns were redefined as heavy machine guns, withdrawn from infantry units, and grouped in the hands of the new Machine Gun Corps (when heavier 0.5 in/12.7 mm calibre machine guns appeared, the tripod-mounted, rifle-calibre machine guns like the Vickers became medium machine guns). After the First World War, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) was disbanded and the Vickers returned to infantry units. Before the Second World War, there were plans to replace the Vickers gun; one of the contenders was the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser Besa machine gun (a Czech design), which eventually became the British Army's standard tank-mounted machine gun. However, the Vickers remained in service with the British Army until 30 March 1968. Its last operational use was in the Radfan during the Aden Emergency. Its successor in UK service is the L7 GPMG. Use in aircraft The cockpit of a Bristol Scout biplane in 1916, showing a Vickers machine gun synchronised to fire through the propeller by an early Vickers-Challenger interrupter gear. In 1913, a Vickers machine gun was mounted on the experimental Vickers E.F.B.1 biplane, which was probably the world's first purpose-built combat aeroplane. However, by the time the production version, the Vickers F.B.5, had entered service the following year, the armament had been changed to a Lewis gun. During World War I, the Vickers gun became a standard weapon on British and French military aircraft, especially after 1916. Although heavier than the Lewis, its closed bolt firing cycle made it much easier to synchronize to allow it to fire through aircraft propellers. The belt feed was enclosed right up to the gun's feed-way to inhibit effects from wind. Steel disintegrating- link ammunition belts were perfected in the UK by William de Courcy Prideaux in mid-war and became standard for aircraft guns thereafter. By 1917 it had been determined that standard rifle calibre cartridges were less satisfactory for shooting down observation balloons than larger calibres carrying incendiary or tracer bullets; the Vickers machine gun was chambered in the 11mm Vickers round, known as the Vickers aircraft machine gun and sometimes the \\"Balloon Buster\\", and was adopted by the Allies as a standard anti-balloon armament, used by both the British and French in this role until the end of the war.Frank C. Barnes, Cartridges of the World, 15th ed, Gun Digest Books, Iola, 2016, .Imperial War Museums, \\"11x59R: 11mm Gras Machine Gun & 11mm Vickers\\", iwm.org.uk, retrieved 4 June 2018. The famous Sopwith Camel and the SPAD XIII types used twin synchronized Vickers, as did most British and French fighters between 1918 and the mid-1930s. In the air, the weighty water cooling system was rendered redundant by the chilly temperatures at high altitude and the constant stream of air passing over the gun as the plane flew; but because the weapon relied on barrel recoil, the (empty) water-holding barrel jacket or casing needed to be retained. Several sets of louvred slots were cut into the barrel jacket to aid air cooling, a better solution than what had initially been attempted with the 1915-vintage lMG 08 German aircraft ordnance. As the machine gun armament of fighter aircraft moved from the fuselage to the wings in the years before the Second World War, the Vickers was generally replaced by the faster-firing and more reliableChorlton, Martyn (2012). Hawker Hurricane Mk I-V. Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2012, Air Vanguard No. 6. . Browning Model 1919 using metal-linked cartridges. The Gloster Gladiator was the last RAF fighter to be armed with the Vickers, although they were later replaced by Brownings. The Fairey Swordfish continued to be fitted with the weapon until production ended in August 1944. Several British bombers and attack aircraft of the Second World War mounted the Vickers K machine gun or VGO, a completely different design, resembling the Lewis gun in external appearance. Vickers machine guns, designated as models E (pilot's) and F (observer's) were also used among others in Poland, where 777 of them were converted to 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge in 1933-1937.Konstankiewicz, Andrzej (1986), Bro≈Ñ strzelecka Wojska Polskiego 1918-39, Warsaw , p. 141 Variants A .5-inch Mk. III, four-gun anti-aircraft mount and its crew on the cruiser in 1941 The larger calibre (half-inch) version of the Vickers was used on armoured fighting vehicles and naval vessels. The Gun, Machine, Vickers, .5-inch, Mk. II was used in tanks, the earlier Mark I having been the development model. This entered service in 1933 and was obsolete in 1944. Firing either single shot or automatic it had a pistol type trigger grip rather than the spades of the 0.303 in (7.7 mm) weapon. The Gun, Machine, Vickers, .5-inch, Mk. III was used as an anti-aircraft gun on British ships. This variation was typically four guns mounted on a 360¬∞ rotating and (+80¬∞ to ‚àí10¬∞) elevating housing. The belts were rolled into a spiral and placed in hoppers beside each gun. The heavy plain bullet weighed and was good for range. Maximum rate of fire for the Mark III was about 700 rpm from a 200-round belt carried in a drum. They were fitted from the 1920s onwards, but in practical terms, proved of little use. During the Second World War, the naval 0.5 in (12.7 mm) version was also mounted on power-operated turrets in smaller watercraft, such as Motor Gun Boats and Motor Torpedo Boats. The Mark IV and V guns were improvements on the Mark II. Intended for British light tanks, some were used during the war on mounts on trucks by the Long Range Desert Group in the North Africa Campaign. The Vickers machine gun was produced, between the wars, as the vz.09 machine gun. Foreign service An Indian Army Vickers machine gun crew in the North West Frontier, India, 1940. The Vickers was widely sold commercially and saw service with many nations and their own particular ammunition. It was also modified for each country and served as a base for many other weapons.

Many of these were donated to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) during the Angolan Civil War. Angolan militants were usually trained in their use by South African advisers. Small quantities re-chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition remained in active service with the South African Defence Force until the mid 1980s, when they were all relegated to reserve storage. Six were withdrawn from storage and reused by a South African liaison team operating with UNITA during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, after which the weapons were finally retired. In the mid-1960s, the Vickers machine gun remained in service in countries such as India, Israel, or Egypt. =Colt‚ÄìVickers M1915= By the early 1900s, the U.S. military had a mixed collection of automatic machine guns in use that included M1895 \\"potato diggers\\", 287 M1904 Maxims, 670 M1909 Ben√©t‚ÄìMerci√© guns, and 353 Lewis machine guns. In 1913, the U.S. began to search for a superior automatic weapon. One of the weapons considered was the British Vickers machine gun. Field tests were conducted of the Vickers in 1914, and the gun was unanimously approved by the board for the army under the designation \\"Vickers Machine Gun Model of 1915, Caliber .30, Water-Cooled\\". One hundred twenty-five guns were ordered from Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1915, with an additional 4,000 ordered the next year, all chambered for .30-06. Design complexities, design modifications, and focus on producing previously ordered weapons meant that when the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, Colt had not manufactured a single M1915. Production began in late 1917 with shipments to the Western Front in mid-1918. The first twelve divisions to reach France were given French Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns, and the next ten had M1915s. The next twelve divisions were to have Browning M1917 machine guns, but there was a shortage of parts. By August 1918, thirteen U.S. divisions were armed with the Colt‚ÄìVickers machine gun. 7,653 guns were issued during the war out of 12,125 produced in total. War damage losses reduced the number of M1915s in the U.S. inventory to about 8,000 total. After World War I, the Colt‚ÄìVickers machine guns were kept in reserve until World War II. Several hundred were sent to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, and were all eventually lost to enemy action. Seven thousand guns were sent to Britain under Lend-Lease to re-equip their forces after the Dunkirk evacuation, which depleted the weapon from the U.S. inventory before their entry into the war. Because the M1915 Colt‚ÄìVickers was not chambered for the standard British .303, it was painted to differentiate it and relegated to Home Guard use. After the end of the war, the British had enough domestic Vickers guns to retire the M1915 from the Home Guard, after which they were disposed of. Specifications .303 inch cartridge from World War II. The type of ammunition is denoted by the colour of the annulus, the narrow ring shown here surrounding the percussion cap The weight of the gun itself varied based on the gear attached, but was generally with a tripod. The ammunition boxes for the 250-round ammunition belts weighed each. In addition, it required about of water in its evaporative cooling system to prevent overheating. The heat of the barrel boiled the water in the jacket surrounding it. The resulting steam was taken off by a flexible tube to a condenser container‚Äîthis had the dual benefits of avoiding giving away the gun's location, and also enabling re-use of the water, which was very important in arid environments. In British service, the Vickers gun fired the standard .303 inch cartridges used in the Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle, which generally had to be hand-loaded into the cloth ammunition belts. There was also a 0.5 in calibre version used as an anti-aircraft weapon and various other calibres produced for foreign buyers. The gun was long and its cyclic rate of fire was between 450 and 600 rounds per minute. In practice, it was expected that 10,000 rounds would be fired per hour, and that the barrel would be changed every hour‚Äîa two-minute job for a trained team. The Vickers gun could sustain fire for long durations of time exceeding the recommended 10,000 rounds an hour due to the water-cooled barrel and hourly barrel swaps. One account states a Vickers fired just under 5 million rounds in a week as a test in 1963 at Strensall Barracks and was still operable. The muzzle velocity was ¬± with Mark VII(z) ammunition and with Mark VIIIz ammunition. The Mark VIIIz cartridge, which had a boat-tailed spitzer 'streamlined' bullet, could be used against targets at a range of approximately . The bullet jackets were generally made of an alloy of cupro-nickel, and gilding metal. Ammunition for the Vickers used colour-coded annuli. Tracer ammunition was marked with a red annulus; armouring-piercing ammunition a green annulus, and incendiary ammunition was marked with a blue annulus. Lastly, explosive ammunition was marked with an orange annulus before the Second World War and was changed to black. Use Soldiers of Princess Patricia‚Äôs Canadian Light Infantry firing a Vickers machine gun during a training exercise, Eastbourne, England, 3 December 1942 The gun and its tripod were carried separately and both were heavy. The Vickers Mk I was 30 lb (13.6 kg) without the water and tripod, and weighed 40 lb (18.1 kg) with the water. The original design did not anticipate it being carried up jungle-covered mountains on men's backs, but such was the weapon's popularity that men were generally content to pack it to all manner of difficult locations. The tripod would be set up to make a firm base, often dug into the ground a little and perhaps with the feet weighted down with sandbags. The water jacket would be filled with about of water from a small hole at the rear end, sealed by a cap. The evaporative cooling system, though heavy, was very effective and enabled the gun to keep firing far longer than its air-cooled rival weapons. If water was unavailable, soldiers were known to resort to using their urine. It was sometimes claimed that crews would fire off a few rounds simply to heat their gun's cooling water to make tea, despite the resulting brew tasting of machine-oil. In extremely cold weather, the cooling water could freeze and damage the gun. This problem was addressed using an insulating water jacket cover, introduced in 1918 but still in use during the Korean War. Some crews added vehicle antifreeze, others drained the water jacket, or simply fired a few rounds periodically to keep the water from freezing. The loader sat to the gunner's right, and fed in belts of cloth, into which the rounds had been placed. The weapon would draw in the belt from right to left, pull the next round out of the belt and into the chamber, fire it, then send the fired brass cartridge down and out of the receiver while the cloth belt would continue out the left side. During sustained fire, the barrel would heat up which heated the water in the jacket until hot enough for the water to evaporate or boil thereby cooling the barrel releasing the heat through steam. It took the Mk I 600 rounds of continuous fire to boil the water in the jacket, evaporating at a rate of 1.5 pints (0.852 L) per 1,000 rounds. The steam would reach the top of the jacket and enter a steam tube which led to a port that was situated under the jacket near the muzzle. A hose was connected to this, which released the steam into a metal water can allowing it to be vented away from the rest of the gun hiding the steam cloud and the gun's position. This also allowed any condensate to be reclaimed from the steam. Before the can got too full, it would be emptied back into the jacket to replenish the water level which would have fallen as the water evaporated and boiled away. If the water jacket needed to be emptied, a plug under the jacket could be unscrewed to drain the entire jacket. Clinometer for Vickers .303 machine gun The Vickers was used for indirect fire against enemy positions at ranges up to with Mark VIIIz ammunition.The Vickers Machine Gun Range Tables This plunging fire was used to great effect against road junctions, trench systems, forming up points, and other locations that might be observed by a forward observer, or zeroed in at one time for future attacks, or guessed at by men using maps and experience. Sometimes a location might be zeroed in during the day, and then attacked at night, much to the surprise and confusion of the enemy. New Zealand units were especially fond of this use. A white disc would be set up on a pole near the MMG, and the gunner would aim at a mark on it, knowing that this corresponded to aiming at the distant target. There was a special back-sight with a tall extension on it for this purpose. The only similar weapon of the time to use indirect fire was the German MG 08, which had a separate attachment sight with range calculator. A British, World War 2, Vickers medium machine gun platoon typically had one officer in command of four guns, in two sections of two, each with a crew and a small team of riflemen whose job was to protect the gun and keep it supplied with ammunition.

It is part of an island chain that extends north to the Straits of Mackinac. The island consists of a ridge of tilted layers of limestone, buried under a blanket of glacial debris. Glaciers carved out the Lake Michigan basin. When the basin filled with water, the peaks of the ridge remained exposed as islands. During post-glacial times, winds blowing on the high, sandy bluffs on the west side of the island moved sand inland, forming sand dunes. Florence Lake is the island's only inland lake. The island has a system of trails and campsites. A growth of Northern white cedars on the southwestern corner of the island are among the oldest and largest in the world. The largest is around and is estimated to be over 500 years old. The lighthouse on South Manitou Island, built in 1871. History South Manitou Island was originally settled in the mid-1830s by William Burton to provide cord wood to fuel the Great Lakes steamships. His dock was built in the middle of the crescent-shaped bay on the eastern side of the island, which offered the only natural deep-water harbor between Chicago and Buffalo. In 1847, the village included Burton's Wharf, a house, blacksmith shop, grocery store, barn, and a wooden tamarack railroad track extending from the dock inland to haul wood for the steamers. When the first post office opened in 1870, it was located here. When logging operations ended and the dock fell into disrepair, the original island village dwindled in size and importance. Burdick's moved their general store from its original location near the old dock to a site near the Lifesaving station in 1923 on the southeastern shore, and that marked the shift of the island community to the current village site located at the present dock where the passenger ferry arrives. Farming developed slowly on the island, but by 1870 most islanders were self- sufficient farmers. Surplus crops were sold to passing ships and mainland markets. The isolation of the island provided an ideal environment for growing prize-winning rye, beans and peas. Today, there are no active farms on the island, but farm buildings, abandoned machinery, the old school and cemetery are reminders of the past. The island is now uninhabited, and most of its buildings lie in ruins. Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service Station South Manitou Island Light Blueprint South Manitou Island was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries as a harbor and fueling station. With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1826, the development of commercial navigation on the Great Lakes increased rapidly. The Manitou Passage was the most important route for schooners and steamers traveling the 300 mile length of Lake Michigan. The island was a stop for early mariners between Chicago and the Straits of Mackinac. To guide storm-driven ships, Congress appropriated $5,000 in 1838 for the construction of a lighthouse. Construction began in 1839, but very little is known about this first lighthouse on South Manitou Island. The specifications were the same as for the Old Presque Isle lighthouse, which included a 30-foot circular tower and a stone keeper's dwelling, but written accounts describe a 1.5 story house with a light tower on one gable end. No sketches or photos exist to determine what was actually built. The location of the light was on a 30-foot sandy knoll near the shore close to the location of the present lighthouse, but the exact location is not known. In 1858, the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment recognized the need for greater safety and replaced this house with a two-story brick residence with a 35-foot tower on top. The tower housed a Fourth Order Fresnel lens. A fog signal building was added and both structures still stand today. The increased shipping traffic brought changes and in 1871, a 100-foot tower was built. The tower is 18 feet in diameter at the base. The walls are hollow and 5 feet thick at the base tapering to 3 feet thick at the top. A passageway was added connecting the tower to the keeper's dwelling. A Third Order Fresnel lens from Paris was installed with a 3-wick lamp that had a range of 18 miles. In 1875, the first steam fog signal on Lake Michigan was installed replacing the fog bell. The 100 foot lighthouse was in operation from 1871 to 1958. The lighthouse is still in good condition. Recent efforts have restored its light tower to operational status for the summer months. In 1901, the United States Life- Saving Service built a station on the island. The USLSS became part of the United States Coast Guard in 1915. The station was permanently closed in 1958. This station is now the island's ranger station and is not open to the public. Map of South Manitou Island. Shipwrecks Francisco Morazan shipwreck. The Manitou islands are surrounded by over 50 known shipwreck sites, some of which are popular diving spots. A preserve was established in 1988 to conserve the historic and archeological value of the fifty known shipwreck sites, dating from 1835 to 1960. One such shipwreck is the , which grounded and became a total loss in 1960 off the south shore of the island. She ran over the wreck of the bulk freighter , stranded November 4, 1903, with a cargo of corn and general merchandise. The eastern side of the island is dominated by a large round bay. This bay is deep until very close to shore. On more than one occasion, ships found here a safe port in a storm, even some of the large bulk carriers. During the \\"Big Blow\\" of 1913, Captain John Stufflebeam nosed the bow of the passenger/packet steamer Illinois up onto the beach. He kept the engines going full for 49 hours so the wind would not blow the vessel back out to sea, until he was able to send two seamen ashore to fasten to a stout tree. When the storm abated 24 hours later, he untied from the tree, put his engines in reverse and backed away from shore to proceed safely on his journey.True Tales of the Great Lakes by Dwight Boyer, Dodd Mead & Company, New York, 1971, References *South Manitou Island: Blocks 1180 and 1181, Census Tract 9704, Leelanau County, Michigan United States Census Bureau *Inventory of Maritime and Recreation Resources of the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve, Kennth J.

Though the empire itself emerged from the decline of Rome and lasted until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453,. the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history, if still imprecise. Many Eastern Orthodox states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the Muslim states of the eastern Mediterranean, preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward. A number of states contemporary with the Byzantine Empire were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the \\"Byzantine commonwealth\\"). These included the Rus, as well as some non-Orthodox states like the Republic of Venice, which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century, and the Kingdom of Sicily, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century. Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence, such as Serbia and Bulgaria. After the fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1453, art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire was often called \\"post-Byzantine.\\" Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Cyprus, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day. Introduction Icon of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints and angels, 6th century, Saint Catherine's Monastery, Sinai Byzantine art originated and evolved from the Christianized Greek culture of the Eastern Roman Empire; content from both Christianity and classical Greek mythology were artistically expressed through Hellenistic modes of style and iconography.; ; ; ; . The art of Byzantium never lost sight of its classical heritage; the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was adorned with a large number of classical sculptures,. although they eventually became an object of some puzzlement for its inhabitants. (however, Byzantine beholders showed no signs of puzzlement towards other forms of classical media such as wall paintings.). The basis of Byzantine art is a fundamental artistic attitude held by the Byzantine Greeks who, like their ancient Greek predecessors, \\"were never satisfied with a play of forms alone, but stimulated by an innate rationalism, endowed forms with life by associating them with a meaningful content.\\". Although the art produced in the Byzantine Empire was marked by periodic revivals of a classical aesthetic, it was above all marked by the development of a new aesthetic defined by its salient \\"abstract\\", or anti- naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. Ethiopian Saint Arethas depicted in traditional Byzantine style (10th century) The nature and causes of this transformation, which largely took place during late antiquity, have been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries.. Giorgio Vasari attributed it to a decline in artistic skills and standards, which had in turn been revived by his contemporaries in the Italian Renaissance. Although this point of view has been occasionally revived, most notably by Bernard Berenson,. modern scholars tend to take a more positive view of the Byzantine aesthetic. Alois Riegl and Josef Strzygowski, writing in the early 20th century, were above all responsible for the revaluation of late antique art.. Riegl saw it as a natural development of pre-existing tendencies in Roman art, whereas Strzygowski viewed it as a product of \\"oriental\\" influences. Notable recent contributions to the debate include those of Ernst Kitzinger,. who traced a \\"dialectic\\" between \\"abstract\\" and \\"Hellenistic\\" tendencies in late antiquity, and John Onians,. who saw an \\"increase in visual response\\" in late antiquity, through which a viewer \\"could look at something which was in twentieth-century terms purely abstract and find it representational.\\" In any case, the debate is purely modern: it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As Cyril Mango has observed, \\"our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of Phidias, Apelles, and Zeuxis.\\". Frescoes in Nerezi near Skopje (1164), with their unique blend of high tragedy, gentle humanity, and homespun realism, anticipate the approach of Giotto and other proto-Renaissance Italian artists. The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. These preoccupations are partly a result of the pious and autocratic nature of Byzantine society, and partly a result of its economic structure: the wealth of the empire was concentrated in the hands of the church and the imperial office, which had the greatest opportunity to undertake monumental artistic commissions. Religious art was not, however, limited to the monumental decoration of church interiors. One of the most important genres of Byzantine art was the icon, an image of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint, used as an object of veneration in Orthodox churches and private homes alike. Icons were more religious than aesthetic in nature: especially after the end of iconoclasm, they were understood to manifest the unique \\"presence\\" of the figure depicted by means of a \\"likeness\\" to that figure maintained through carefully maintained canons of representation.. The illumination of manuscripts was another major genre of Byzantine art. The most commonly illustrated texts were religious, both scripture itself (particularly the Psalms) and devotional or theological texts (such as the Ladder of Divine Ascent of John Climacus or the homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus). Secular texts were also illuminated: important examples include the Alexander Romance and the history of John Skylitzes. The Byzantines inherited the Early Christian distrust of monumental sculpture in religious art, and produced only reliefs, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from Carolingian art onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief. The so-called \\"minor arts\\" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, glass, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off Byzantine silver. Periods Rotunda of St. George, Thessaloniki, with remnants of the mosaics Byzantine art and architecture is divided into four periods by convention: the Early period, commencing with the Edict of Milan (when Christian worship was legitimized) and the transfer of the imperial seat to Constantinople, extends to AD 842, with the conclusion of Iconoclasm; the Middle, or high period, begins with the restoration of the icons in 843 and culminates in the Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204; the Late period includes the eclectic osmosis between Western European and traditional Byzantine elements in art and architecture, and ends with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The term post-Byzantine is then used for later years, whereas \\"Neo- Byzantine\\" is used for art and architecture from the 19th century onwards, when the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire prompted a renewed appreciation of Byzantium by artists and historians alike.  Early Byzantine art  Leaf from an ivory diptych of Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus, consul in Constantinople, 506. Areobindus is shown above, presiding over the games in the Hippodrome, depicted beneath (Mus√©e national du Moyen √Çge) The St. George Rotunda in Sofia, built in the 4th century, and some remains of Serdica can be seen in the foreground Two events were of fundamental importance to the development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the Edict of Milan, issued by the emperors Constantine I and Licinius in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led to the development of a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of Constantinople in 330 created a great new artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome, but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the Arabs and Rome to the Goths - that Constantinople established its supremacy. Constantine devoted great effort to the decoration of Constantinople, adorning its public spaces with ancient statuary,. and building a forum dominated by a porphyry column that carried a statue of himself.; . Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, Constantius II, included the original foundations of Hagia Sophia and the Church of the Holy Apostles.; The next major building campaign in Constantinople was sponsored by Theodosius I. The most important surviving monument of this period is the obelisk and base erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome. which, with the large silver dish called the Missorium of Theodosius I, represents the classic examples of what is sometimes called the \\"Theodosian Renaissance\\". The earliest surviving church in Constantinople is the Basilica of St. John at the Stoudios Monastery, built in the fifth century.. Miniatures of the 6th-century Rabula Gospel (a Byzantine Syriac Gospel) display the more abstract and symbolic nature of Byzantine art Due to subsequent rebuilding and destruction, relatively few Constantinopolitan monuments of this early period survive. However, the development of monumental early Byzantine art can still be traced through surviving structures in other cities. For example, important early churches are found in Rome (including Santa Sabina and Santa Maria Maggiore),. and in Thessaloniki (the Rotunda and the Acheiropoietos Basilica).; . A number of important illuminated manuscripts, both sacred and secular, survive from this early period. Classical authors, including Virgil (represented by the Vergilius Vaticanus. and the Vergilius Romanus). and Homer (represented by the Ambrosian Iliad), were illustrated with narrative paintings. Illuminated biblical manuscripts of this period survive only in fragments: for example, the Quedlinburg Itala fragment is a small portion of what must have been a lavishly illustrated copy of 1 Kings.. Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of ivory carving.. Ivory diptychs, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed consuls.. Silver plates were another important form of luxury art:. among the most lavish from this period is the Missorium of Theodosius I.. Sarcophagi continued to be produced in great numbers. Age of Justinian I Mosaic from San Vitale in Ravenna, showing the Emperor Justinian and Bishop Maximian, surrounded by clerics and soldiers. Archangel ivory of the early 6th century from Constantinople Significant changes in Byzantine art coincided with the reign of Justinian I (527‚Äì565). Justinian devoted much of his reign to reconquering Italy, North Africa and Spain. He also laid the foundations of the imperial absolutism of the Byzantine state, codifying its laws and imposing his religious views on all his subjects by law.. A significant component of Justinian's project of imperial renovation was a massive building program, which was described in a book, the Buildings, written by Justinian's court historian, Procopius.Tr. H.B. Dewing, Procopius VII (Cambridge, 1962). Justinian renovated, rebuilt, or founded anew countless churches within Constantinople, including Hagia Sophia,. which had been destroyed during the Nika riots, the Church of the Holy Apostles,. and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus.; . Justinian also built a number of churches and fortifications outside of the imperial capital, including Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt,. Basilica of Saint Sofia in Sofia and the Basilica of St. John in Ephesus.. Nave of Basilica of Saint Sofia Several major churches of this period were built in the provinces by local bishops in imitation of the new Constantinopolitan foundations. The Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, was built by Bishop Maximianus. The decoration of San Vitale includes important mosaics of Justinian and his empress, Theodora, although neither ever visited the church.. Also of note is the Euphrasian Basilica in Poreƒç.Eufrasiana Basilica Project. Archeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries unearthed a large group of Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East. The eastern provinces of the Eastern Roman and later the Byzantine Empires inherited a strong artistic tradition from the Late Antiquity. Christian mosaic art flourished in this area from the 4th century onwards. The tradition of making mosaics was carried on in the Umayyad era until the end of the 8th century. The most important surviving examples are the Madaba Map, the mosaics of Mount Nebo, Saint Catherine's Monastery and the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now Umm ar- Rasas). The first fully preserved illuminated biblical manuscripts date to the first half of the sixth century, most notably the Vienna Genesis,. the Rossano Gospels,. and the Sinope Gospels.. The Vienna Dioscurides is a lavishly illustrated botanical treatise, presented as a gift to the Byzantine aristocrat Julia Anicia.. Important ivory sculptures of this period include the Barberini ivory, which probably depicts Justinian himself,. and the Archangel ivory in the British Museum.. Silver plate continued to be decorated with scenes drawn from classical mythology; for example, a plate preserved in the Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris, depicts Hercules wrestling the Nemean lion. Seventh-century crisis Mosaic from the church of Hagios Demetrios in Thessaloniki, late 7th or early 8th century, showing St. Demetrios with the bishop and the eparch The Age of Justinian was followed by a political decline, since most of Justinian's conquests were lost and the Empire faced acute crisis with the invasions of the Avars, Slavs, Persians and Arabs in the 7th century. Constantinople was also wracked by religious and political conflict.. The most significant surviving monumental projects of this period were undertaken outside of the imperial capital. The church of Hagios Demetrios in Thessaloniki was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-seventh century. The new sections include mosaics executed in a remarkably abstract style.. The church of the Koimesis in Nicaea (present-day Iznik), destroyed in the early 20th century but documented through photographs, demonstrates the simultaneous survival of a more classical style of church decoration.. The churches of Rome, still a Byzantine territory in this period, also include important surviving decorative programs, especially Santa Maria Antiqua, Sant'Agnese fuori le mura, and the Chapel of San Venanzio in San Giovanni in Laterano.. Byzantine mosaicists probably also contributed to the decoration of the early Umayyad monuments, including the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of Damascus.; . Important works of luxury art from this period include the silver David Plates, produced during the reign of Emperor Heraclius, and depicting scenes from the life of the Hebrew king David.. The most notable surviving manuscripts are Syriac gospel books, such as the so-called Syriac Bible of Paris.. However, the London Canon Tables bear witness to the continuing production of lavish gospel books in Greek.. The period between Justinian and iconoclasm saw major changes in the social and religious roles of images within Byzantium. The veneration of acheiropoieta, or holy images \\"not made by human hands,\\" became a significant phenomenon, and in some instances these images were credited with saving cities from military assault. By the end of the seventh century, certain images of saints had come to be viewed as \\"windows\\" through which one could communicate with the figure depicted. Proskynesis before images is also attested in texts from the late seventh century. These developments mark the beginnings of a theology of icons.. At the same time, the debate over the proper role of art in the decoration of churches intensified. Three canons of the Quinisext Council of 692 addressed controversies in this area: prohibition of the representation of the cross on church pavements (Canon 73), prohibition of the representation of Christ as a lamb (Canon 82), and a general injunction against \\"pictures, whether they are in paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the mind, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures\\" (Canon 100). Crisis of iconoclasm Helios in his chariot, surrounded by symbols of the months and of the zodiac. From Vat. Gr. 1291, the \\"Handy Tables\\" of Ptolemy, produced during the reign of Constantine V Intense debate over the role of art in worship led eventually to the period of \\"Byzantine iconoclasm.\\"; . Sporadic outbreaks of iconoclasm on the part of local bishops are attested in Asia Minor during the 720s. In 726, an underwater earthquake between the islands of Thera and Therasia was interpreted by Emperor Leo III as a sign of God's anger, and may have led Leo to remove a famous icon of Christ from the Chalke Gate outside the imperial palace.; The story of the Chalke Icon may be a later invention: . However, iconoclasm probably did not become imperial policy until the reign of Leo's son, Constantine V. The Council of Hieria, convened under Constantine in 754, proscribed the manufacture of icons of Christ. This inaugurated the Iconoclastic period, which lasted, with interruptions, until 843. While iconoclasm severely restricted the role of religious art, and led to the removal of some earlier apse mosaics and (possibly) the sporadic destruction of portable icons, it never constituted a total ban on the production of figural art. Ample literary sources indicate that secular art (i.e. hunting scenes and depictions of the games in the hippodrome) continued to be produced,. and the few monuments that can be securely dated to the period (most notably the manuscript of Ptolemy's \\"Handy Tables\\" today held by the Vatican.) demonstrate that metropolitan artists maintained a high quality of production.. Major churches dating to this period include Hagia Eirene in Constantinople, which was rebuilt in the 760s following its destruction by the 740 Constantinople earthquake. The interior of Hagia Eirene, which is dominated by a large mosaic cross in the apse, is one of the best-preserved examples of iconoclastic church decoration.. The church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki was also rebuilt in the late 8th century.. Certain churches built outside of the empire during this period, but decorated in a figural, \\"Byzantine,\\" style, may also bear witness to the continuing activities of Byzantine artists. Particularly important in this regard are the original mosaics of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen (since either destroyed or heavily restored) and the frescoes in the Church of Maria foris portas in Castelseprio. Macedonian art Mosaics of Nea Moni of Chios (11th century) An example of Macedonian-era ivorywork from Constantinople: the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, now in the Bode Museum, Berlin The rulings of the Council of Hieria were reversed by a new church council in 843, celebrated to this day in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the \\"Triumph of Orthodoxy.\\" In 867, the installation of a new apse mosaic in Hagia Sophia depicting the Virgin and Child was celebrated by the Patriarch Photios in a famous homily as a victory over the evils of iconoclasm. Later in the same year, the Emperor Basil I, called \\"the Macedonian,\\" acceded to the throne; as a result the following period of Byzantine art has sometimes been called the \\"Macedonian Renaissance\\", although the term is doubly problematic (it was neither \\"Macedonian\\", nor, strictly speaking, a \\"Renaissance\\"). In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Empire's military situation improved, and patronage of art and architecture increased. New churches were commissioned, and the standard architectural form (the \\"cross-in-square\\") and decorative scheme of the Middle Byzantine church were standardised. Major surviving examples include Hosios Loukas in Boeotia, the Daphni Monastery near Athens and Nea Moni on Chios. There was a revival of interest in the depiction of subjects from classical Greek mythology (as on the Veroli Casket) and in the use of a \\"classical\\" Hellenistic styles to depict religious, and particularly Old Testament, subjects (of which the Paris Psalter and the Joshua Roll are important examples). The Macedonian period also saw a revival of the late antique technique of ivory carving. Many ornate ivory triptychs and diptychs survive, such as the Harbaville Triptych and a triptych at Luton Hoo, dating from the reign of Nicephorus Phocas. Komnenian age Mosaic of Daphni Monastery (ca. 1100) The Macedonian emperors were followed by the Komnenian dynasty, beginning with the reign of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081. Byzantium had recently suffered a period of severe dislocation following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor to the Turks. However, the Komnenoi brought stability to the empire (1081‚Äì1185) and during the course of the twelfth century their energetic campaigning did much to restore the fortunes of the empire. The Komnenoi were great patrons of the arts, and with their support Byzantine artists continued to move in the direction of greater humanism and emotion, of which the Theotokos of Vladimir, the cycle of mosaics at Daphni, and the murals at Nerezi yield important examples. Ivory sculpture and other expensive mediums of art gradually gave way to frescoes and icons, which for the first time gained widespread popularity across the Empire. Apart from painted icons, there were other varieties - notably the mosaic and ceramic ones. Some of the finest Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of Gelati, Kiev, Torcello, Venice, Monreale, Cefal√π and Palermo. For instance, Venice's Basilica of St Mark, begun in 1063, was based on the great Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an echo of the age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the basilica is also a great museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., Pala d'Oro).

The destruction by sack or subsequent neglect of the city's secular architecture in particular has left us with an imperfect understanding of Byzantine art. Although the Byzantines regained the city in 1261, the Empire was thereafter a small and weak state confined to the Greek peninsula and the islands of the Aegean. During their half-century of exile, however, the last great flowing of Anatolian Hellenism began. As Nicaea emerged as the center of opposition under the Laskaris emperors, it spawned a renaissance, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from across the Byzantine world. A glittering court emerged as the dispossessed intelligentsia found in the Hellenic side of their traditions a pride and identity unsullied by association with the hated \\"latin\\" enemy.. With the recapture of the capital under the new Palaeologan Dynasty, Byzantine artists developed a new interest in landscapes and pastoral scenes, and the traditional mosaic-work (of which the Chora Church in Constantinople is the finest extant example) gradually gave way to detailed cycles of narrative frescoes (as evidenced in a large group of Mystras churches). The icons, which became a favoured medium for artistic expression, were characterized by a less austere attitude, new appreciation for purely decorative qualities of painting and meticulous attention to details, earning the popular name of the Paleologan Mannerism for the period in general. Venice came to control Byzantine Crete by 1212, and Byzantine artistic traditions continued long after the Ottoman conquest of the last Byzantine successor state in 1461. The Cretan school, as it is today known, gradually introduced Western elements into its style, and exported large numbers of icons to the West. The tradition's most famous artist was El Greco.

The splendour of Byzantine art was always in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most important movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit to stand next to both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial Carolingian art and Ottonian art. Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, and reached for example the royal Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo burial in Suffolk of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. Byzantine silks were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople. There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at Castelseprio and miniatures in the Vienna Coronation Gospels, seem to have been produced by such figures. In particular, teams of mosaic artists were dispatched as diplomatic gestures by emperors to Italy, where they often trained locals to continue their work in a style heavily influenced by Byzantium. Venice and Norman Sicily were particular centres of Byzantine influence. The earliest surviving panel paintings in the West were in a style heavily influenced by contemporary Byzantine icons, until a distinctive Western style began to develop in Italy in the Trecento; the traditional and still influential narrative of Vasari and others has the story of Western painting begin as a breakaway by Cimabue and then Giotto from the shackles of the Byzantine tradition. In general, Byzantine artistic influence on Europe was in steep decline by the 14th century if not earlier, despite the continued importance of migrated Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance in other areas. Islamic art began with artists and craftsmen mostly trained in Byzantine styles, and though figurative content was greatly reduced, Byzantine decorative styles remained a great influence on Islamic art, and Byzantine artists continued to be imported for important works for some time, especially for mosaics. The Byzantine era properly defined came to an end with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, but by this time the Byzantine cultural heritage had been widely diffused, carried by the spread of Orthodox Christianity, to Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania and, most importantly, to Russia, which became the centre of the Orthodox world following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Even under Ottoman rule, Byzantine traditions in icon-painting and other small-scale arts survived, especially in the Venetian-ruled Crete and Rhodes, where a \\"post- Byzantine\\" style under increasing Western influence survived for a further two centuries, producing artists including El Greco whose training was in the Cretan School which was the most vigorous post-Byzantine school, exporting great numbers of icons to Europe. The willingness of the Cretan School to accept Western influence was atypical; in most of the post-Byzantine world \\"as an instrument of ethnic cohesiveness, art became assertively conservative during the Turcocratia\\" (period of Ottoman rule).. Russian icon painting began by entirely adopting and imitating Byzantine art, as did the art of other Orthodox nations, and has remained extremely conservative in iconography, although its painting style has developed distinct characteristics, including influences from post-Renaissance Western art. All the Eastern Orthodox churches have remained highly protective of their traditions in terms of the form and content of images and, for example, modern Orthodox depictions of the Nativity of Christ vary little in content from those developed in the 6th century.

The word Muscicapa comes from the Latin musca, a fly and capere, to catch. The specific dauurica refers to Dauria, an area of south-eastern Siberia named after a local nomadic tribe.. This is an insectivorous species which breeds in Japan, eastern Siberia and the Himalayas. It is migratory and winters in tropical southern Asia from southern India and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia. The correct specific epithet for this species is disputed. Description This species is long, including the cocked tail. It is similar in shape to the larger spotted flycatcher, but is relatively longer-tailed. The dark bill is relatively large and broad-based. The adult has grey-brown upperparts, which become greyer as the plumage ages, and whitish underparts with brown-tinged flanks. Young birds have scaly brown upperparts, head and breast.

His large oeuvre of works is extremely varied in style, having been influenced by serialism, atonality, Stravinsky, Italian music, Arabic music and jazz, as well as traditional schools of German composition. In particular, his stage works reflect \\"his consistent cultivation of music for the theatre throughout his life\\". Henze was also known for his political convictions. He left Germany for Italy in 1953 because of a perceived intolerance towards his leftist politics and homosexuality. Late in life he lived in the village of Marino in the central Italian region of Lazio, and in his final years still travelled extensively, in particular to Britain and Germany, as part of his work. An avowed Marxist and member of the Italian Communist Party, Henze produced compositions honoring Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara. At the 1968 Hamburg premiere of his requiem for Che Guevara, titled Das Flo√ü der Medusa (The Raft of Medusa), the placing of a red flag on the stage sparked a riot and the arrest of several people, including the librettist. Henze spent a year from 1969 to 1970 teaching in Cuba. Life and works Early years Henze was born in G√ºtersloh, Westphalia, the eldest of six children of a teacher, and showed early interest in art and music. That and his political views led to conflict with his conservative father. Henze's father, Franz, had served in the First World War and was wounded at Verdun. He worked as a teacher in a school at Bielefeld, formed on progressive lines, but it was closed in 1933 by government order because its progressive style was out of step with official views. Franz Henze then moved to D√ºnne, a small village near B√ºnde, where he fell under the spell of Nazi propaganda. Books by Jewish and Christian authors were replaced in the Henze household by literature reflecting Nazi views; the whole family was expected to fall into line with Franz's new thinking. The older boys, including Hans, were enrolled in the Hitler Youth. Although the Henze household was filled with talk of current affairs, Hans was also able to hear broadcasts of classical music (especially Mozart) and eventually his father realized that his son had a vocation as a musician. Henze began studies at the state music school of Braunschweig in 1942, where he studied piano, percussion, and theory. Franz Henze rejoined the army in 1943 and he was sent to the Eastern front, where he died. Henze had to break off his studies after being conscripted into the army in 1944, towards the end of the Second World War. He was trained as a radio officer. He was soon captured by the British and held in a prisoner-of-war camp for the remainder of the war. In 1945 he became an accompanist in the Bielefeld City Theatre, and continued his studies under Wolfgang Fortner at Heidelberg University in 1946. Henze had some successful performances at Darmstadt, including an immediate success in 1946 with a neo-baroque work for piano, flute and strings, that brought him to the attention of Schott's, the music publishers. He also took part in the famous Darmstadt New Music Summer School, a key vehicle for the propagation of avant- garde techniques. At the 1947 summer school, Henze turned to serial technique. In his early years he worked with twelve-tone technique, for example in his First Symphony and First Violin Concerto of 1947. Sadler's Wells Ballet visited Hamburg in 1948; this inspired Henze to write a choreographic poem, Ballett-Variationen, which he completed in 1949. The first ballet he saw was Frederick Ashton's Sc√®nes de Ballet. He wrote a letter of appreciation to Ashton, introducing himself as a 22-year-old composer. The next time he wrote to Ashton he enclosed the score of his Ballett-Variationen, which he hoped Ashton might find of interest. This work was first performed in D√ºsseldorf in September 1949 and staged for the first time in Wuppertal in 1958. In 1948 he became musical assistant at the Deutscher Theater in Konstanz, where his first opera ', based on the work of Cervantes, was created. In 1950 he became ballet conductor at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden, where he composed two operas for radio, his First Piano Concerto, as well as his first stage work of real note, the jazz-influenced opera Boulevard Solitude, a modern recasting of the traditional Manon Lescaut story. Move to Italy Henze left Germany in 1953, in reaction against homophobia and the country's general political climate. His publisher, Schott's, had also offered Henze an advance on royalties, on condition that he leave his conducting posts to focus on composition. This financial incentive allowed Henze to move to Italy, where he remained for most of his life. He settled on the island of Ischia in the Gulf of Naples. Also resident on the island were the composer William Walton and his wife Susana, who took a great interest in the young German composer. Henze's Quattro poemi for orchestra in 1955 made clear that he had moved far from the principles of the Darmstadt avant-garde. In January 1956 he left Ischia and moved to the mainland to live in Naples. Initially he suffered further disappointment, with controversial premieres of the opera K√∂nig Hirsch, based on a text by Carlo Gozzi, and the ballet Maratona di danza, with a libretto by Luchino Visconti. However, he then began a long-lasting and fruitful creative partnership with the poet Ingeborg Bachmann. Working with her as librettist, he composed the operas Der Prinz von Homburg (1958) based on a text by Heinrich von Kleist and Der junge Lord (1964) after Wilhelm Hauff, as well as Serenades and Arias (1957) and his Choral Fantasy (1964). He composed his Five Neapolitan Songs for Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau soon after his arrival in Naples. A later sojourn in Greece provided the opportunity to complete his H√∂lderlin-based work Kammermusik 1958, dedicated to Benjamin Britten and premiered by the tenor Peter Pears, the guitarist Julian Bream and an eight-member chamber ensemble. Henze moved in 1961 to a secluded villa, 'La Leprara', on the hills of Marino, overlooking the River Tiber south of Rome. This time also signalled a strong leaning towards music involving the voice. From 1962 until 1967, Henze taught masterclasses in composition at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and in 1967 he became a visiting Professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. One of his greatest successes was the premiere of the opera Die Bassariden at the Salzburg Festival. In the following period, he greatly strengthened his political involvement which also influenced his musical work. For example, the premi√®re of his oratorio Das Flo√ü der Medusa in Hamburg failed when his West Berlin collaborators refused to perform under a portrait of Che Guevara and a revolutionary flag had been placed upon the stage.Ernst Schnabel, \\"Zum Untergang einer Urauff√ºhrung\\" and \\"Postscriptum nach dreiunddreissig Tagen\\", in Hans Werner Henze and Ernst Schnabel, Das Floss der Medusa: Text zum Oratorium, 47‚Äì61 & 65‚Äì79 (Munich: Piper-Verlag, 1969); Andrew Porter, \\"Henze: The Raft of the Frigate 'Medusa' ‚Äì Oratorio\\" [record review of DGG 139428-9], Gramophone 47, no. 563 (April 1970): 1625; \\"Aff√§ren/Henze: Sie bleibt\\", Der Spiegel 22, no. 51 (16 December 1968): 152. His politics also influenced his Sixth Symphony (1969), Second Violin Concerto (1971), Voices (1973), and his piece for spoken word and chamber orchestra, El Cimarr√≥n, based on a book by Cuban author Miguel Barnet about escaped black slaves during Cuba's colonial period. An established composer His political critique reached its high point in 1976 with the premiere of his opera We Come to the River. In the same year Henze founded the Cantiere Internazionale d'Arte in Montepulciano for the promotion of new music, where his children's opera Pollicino premiered in 1980. From 1980 until 1991 he led a class in composition in the Cologne Music School. In 1981 he founded the M√ºrztal Workshops in the Austrian region of Styria, the same region where he set up the Deutschlandsberg Youth Music Festival in 1984. In 1988 he founded the Munich Biennale, an \\"international festival for new music theatre\\", of which he was the artistic director. His own operas became more conventional once more, for example The English Cat (1983), and Das verratene Meer (1990), based on Yukio Mishima's novel Gogo no Eiko, known in English as The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea. His later works, while less controversial, continued his political and social engagement. His Requiem (1990‚Äì93) comprised nine 'sacred concertos' for piano, trumpet and chamber orchestra, and was written in memory of Michael Vyner, the artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. The choral Ninth Symphony (1997), ‚Äì \\"dedicated to the heroes and martyrs of German anti-fascism\\" ‚Äì to a libretto by Hans-Ulrich Treichel based on motifs from the novel The Seventh Cross by Anna Seghers is a defiant rejection of Nazi barbarism, with which Henze himself lived as a child and teenager. His last success was the 2003 premiere of the opera L'Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe (English: The Hoopoe and the Triumph of Filial Love) at the Salzburg Festival, with a text he wrote himself, based on a Syrian fairy tale. Other late compositions include Sebastian im Traum (2004) for large orchestra and the opera Phaedra (2007). Henze lived with his partner Fausto Moroni from the early sixties, and Moroni planned and planted the hillside garden around La Leprara. Moroni cared for the composer when he suffered a spectacular emotional collapse during which he barely spoke and had to be encouraged to eat, living as though in a coma. In 2007, shortly after Henze's sudden recovery, Moroni died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Elogium Musicum (2008), for large orchestra and chorus singing Henze's own Latin text, is a memorial to his partner of more than forty years. In 1995 Henze received the Westphalian Music Prize, which has carried his name since 2001. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the tenth composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr√§t of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2000, but owing to illness he did not attend. The music included his Requiem. On 7 November 2004, Henze received an honorary doctorate in Musicology from the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater M√ºnchen (University for Music and Performing Arts, Munich). In 1975 he became an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music, London. The English version of his autobiography, Bohemian Fifths, was published in 1998. Henze died in Dresden on 27 October 2012 at the age of 86. Works Henze's music has incorporated neoclassicism, jazz, the twelve-tone technique, serialism, and some rock or popular music. Although he did study atonalism early in his career, after his move to Italy in 1953, Henze's music became considerably more Neapolitan in style. His opera K√∂nig Hirsch (\\"The Stag King\\") contains lush, rich textures. This trend is carried further in the opulent ballet music that he wrote for English choreographer Frederick Ashton's Ondine, completed in 1957. While Mendelssohn and Weber were important influences, the music for Ondine contains some jazz and there is much in it redolent of Stravinsky‚Äînot only Stravinsky the neo-classical composer, but also the composer of The Rite of Spring. His Maratona di danza, on the other hand, required much tighter integration of jazz elements, complete with an on- stage band, which was very different from the more romantic Ondine. Henze received much of the impetus for his ballet music from his earlier job as ballet adviser at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden. The textures for the cantata Kammermusik (1958, rev. 1963) are far harsher; Henze returned to atonalism in Antifone, and later the other styles mentioned above again became important in his music.

Approximately long overall, both ends connected to the Pennsylvania Canal, and the system was primarily used as a portage railway, haulting river boats and barges over the divide between the Ohio and the Susquehanna Rivers. Today, the remains of the railroad are preserved within the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site operated by the National Park Service. The railroad was authorized as part of the Main Line of Public Works legislation in 1824. It had five inclines on either side of the drainage divide running athwart the ridge line from Blair Gap through along the kinked saddle at the summit into Cresson, Pennsylvania. The endpoints connected to the Canal at Johnstown on the west through the relative flats to Hollidaysburg on the east. The Railroad utilized cleverly designed wheeled barges to ride a narrow-gauge rail track with steam-powered stationary engines lifting the vehicles. The roadbed of the railroad did not incline monotonically upwards, but rose in relatively long, saw-toothed stretches of slightly-sloped flat terrain suitable to animal powered towing, alternating with steep cable railway inclined planes using static steam engine powered windlasses, similar to mechanisms of modern ski lifts. Except for peak moments of severe storms, it was an all-weather, all-seasons operation. Along with the rest of the Main Works, it cut transport time from Philadelphia to the Ohio River from weeks to just 3‚Äì5 days. Considered a technological marvel in its day, it played a critical role in opening the interior of the United States beyond the Appalachian Mountains to settlement and commerce. It included the first railroad tunnel in the United States, the Staple Bend Tunnel, and its inauguration was marked with great fanfare. History Old Portage Railroad, a drawing by George W. Storm, 1839 Construction of the Old Portage Railroad from Hollidaysburg to Johnstown, thirty six miles long, began in 1831 and took three years to complete. It included a tunnel long as well as a viaduct over the Little Conemaugh River upstream from Johnstown. The vertical ascent from Johnstown was . The vertical ascent from Hollidaysburg was . The project was financed by the State of Pennsylvania as a means to compete with the Erie Canal in New York and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Maryland. The work was done largely through private contractors. The railroad utilized eleven grade lines and ten cable inclined planes, five on either side of the summit of the Allegheny Ridge, to carry loaded canal boats on flatbed railroad cars. Trains of two-three cars were pulled on grade lines by mules. On inclined planes, stationary steam engines pulled up and lowered down cars by hemp ropes switching to wire ropes in 1842.Modern History of Wire Rope by Donald Sayenga The entire Main Line system connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburgh via the Philadelphia-Columbia railroad, the Columbia-Hollidaysburg canal, the Portage railroad linking Hollidaysburg to Johnstown, and a canal from Johnstown to Pittsburgh, was long. A typical ride took 4 days instead of the former 23-day horse-wagon journey.Ten inclined planes on the Allegheny Portage Railroad, National Park Service The Old Portage Railroad was in operation for twenty years being considered \\"the wonder of America.\\"Boucher, John N. History of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. New York: The Lewis Publishing Company, 1906. Charles Dickens wrote a contemporary account of travel on the railroad in Chapter 10 of his American Notes. Quoted at length in the Pennsylvania guide, Dickens \\"described travel on the Portage in 1842,\\" describing aspects of the Portage Railroad's immediate social and geographic context, as well as mechanical strategies used by the Railroad for coping with the steep grades encountered on the route : In the 1850s, the Main Line of Public Works and its portage railroad was rendered obsolete by the advance of railway technology and railroad engineering. Early in 1846 the Legislature chartered the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) to cross the entire state in response to plans by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to reach the Ohio Valley through Virginia. In December 1852 trains started to run between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh shortening the travel time from 4 days to 13 hours.Allegheny Portage Railroad, Gallitzin, PA: Life on the Portage Construction on the New Portage Railroad, a 40-mile realignment to cross the Allegheny Ridge bypassing inclines, started in 1851 and cost $2.14 million. The PRR raised sufficient investment and had enough quick success that they bought the existing Portage railroad and other parts of the Main Line of Public Works from the state on July 31, 1857. The PRR abandoned most of the line and used the rest as local branches; \\"anything of value was either sold or stripped from the Allegheny Portage Railroad.\\"Lindeman, Teresa F. Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site: An engineering marvel, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 19, 2016. Nearly half a century later, the graded roadbeds of the descending section east of the Gallitzin Tunnel were re-railed with standard gauge freight tracks. The line reopened as a freight bypass line in 1904. Pennsylvania Railroad successor Conrail abandoned this line to Hollidaysburg and most of the branch trackage along the Juniata River in 1981 and removed the rails. Profile of the original line of the Portage railroad from Hollidaysburg to Johnstown National Historic Site The National Historic Site was established on in 1964 and is about west of Altoona, in Blair and Cambria counties. The park service operates a visitor center with interpretive exhibits near the old line. Nearby is the Samuel Lemon House, a tavern located alongside the railroad near Cresson that was a popular stop for railroad passengers; it has been converted into a historical museum by the National Park Service. The NPS also maintains a length of reconstructed track, an engine house with exhibits, a picnic area, and hiking trails. A skew arch bridge, a masterwork of cut stone construction, is another feature of the site near the Lemon House. The bridge is long on the south elevation, long on the north elevation, and high. It was the only bridge on the line that was built to carry a road. The Staple Bend Tunnel is preserved in a separate unit of the historic site, east of Johnstown.

Cheng can also be the Cantonese version of Zheng (ÈÑ≠) and Jing (‰∫ï), non-standard romanization of Cen (Â≤ë), and Teochew or Hokkien pronunciation of Zhong (Èçæ) and Zhuang (Ëéä). Further confusion arises because Wade‚ÄìGiles often appears without the required apostrophes (which indicates aspiration), and thus some Wade‚ÄìGiles names which are properly romanized Ch'eng (such as Á®ã pinyin Ch√©ng) will appear as Cheng. Origins There are a number of the origin of the same Êàê (Ch√©ng) surname. It was the name of fiefdom Cheng (ÈÉï) in Henan belong to Shu Wu, a son of King Wen of Zhou. His descendants adopted the name Cheng, simplifying it to Êàê by dropping the radical. Similarly descendants of Ji Zai, who was granted another fief of the same name in Shandong by King Wu of Zhou, also simplified the name and adopted it as their surname. The name may also be derived from a fief of the name Cheng Êàê in the state of Lu. Descendants of a Cheng Hu (ÊàêËôé), son of the ruler of Chu Ruo'ao, also adopted Cheng as their surname. Others are descendants of Tu Ge invaders and other tribes in China. The Ch√©ng (Á®ã) surname may have come from a fief named Cheng in Henan, as well as another in Shaanxi. See article on Zheng for the origins of the surname Zheng (ÈÑ≠).

Cheng usually is only seen to be applied to the last name due to the meaning and nature of the chosen 'Cheng', if it was 'Êàê' where it means 'to become' then it is suited best as a last name as it symbolises a foreseeing connotation and would make more sense at the end of a name, but also in Chinese name layout, the last name is usually said first. whereas if it were 'ÊæÑ' meaning 'clarity', then it would be more likely seen as a first name, this usually appears in the middle of the name in Chinese format.

Mobile browsers are optimized so as to display Web content most effectively for small screens on portable devices. Mobile browser software must be small and efficient to accommodate the low memory capacity and low-bandwidth of wireless handheld devices.\\"A Survey of Techniques for Improving Efficiency of Mobile Web Browsing\\", Mittal et al., CPE, 2018 Typically, they were stripped-down web browsers, however, some recent mobile browsers can handle latest technologies also such as CSS 3, JavaScript, and Ajax. Websites designed so that they may be accessed from these browsers are referred to as wireless portals or collectively as the Mobile Web. They may automatically create \\"mobile\\" version of each page, for example the Wikipedia website. Underlying technology The mobile browser usually connects via cellular network, or increasingly via Wireless LAN, using standard HTTP over TCP/IP and displays web pages written in HTML, XHTML Mobile Profile (WAP 2.0), or WML (which evolved from HDML). WML and HDML are stripped-down formats suitable for transmission across limited bandwidth, and wireless data connection called WAP. In Japan, DoCoMo defined the i-mode service based on i-mode HTML, which is an extension of Compact HTML (C-HTML), a simple subset of HTML. WAP 2.0 specifies XHTML Mobile Profile plus WAP CSS, subsets of the W3C's standard XHTML and CSS with minor mobile extensions. Newer mobile browsers are full-featured Web browsers capable of HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, as well as mobile technologies such as WML, i-mode HTML, or cHTML. To accommodate small screens, they use Post-WIMP interfaces. History The first mobile browser for a PDA was PocketWeb for the Apple Newton created at TecO in 1994, followed by the first commercial product NetHopper released in August 1996. The so-called \\"microbrowser\\" technologies such as WAP, NTTDocomo's i-mode platform and Openwave's HDML platform fueled the first wave of interest in wireless data services. The first deployment of a mobile browser on a mobile phone was probably in 1997 when Unwired Planet (later to become Openwave) put their \\"UP.Browser\\" on AT&T; handsets to give users access to HDML content. A British company, STNC Ltd., developed a mobile browser (HitchHiker) in 1997 that was intended to present the entire device UI. The demonstration platform for this mobile browser (Webwalker) had 1 MIPS total processing power. This was a single core platform, running the GSM stack on the same processor as the application stack. In 1999 STNC was acquired by Microsoft and HitchHiker became Microsoft Mobile Explorer 2.0, not related to the primitive Microsoft Mobile Explorer 1.0. HitchHiker is believed to be the first mobile browser with a unified rendering model, handling HTML and WAP along with ECMAScript, WMLScript, POP3 and IMAP mail in a single client. Although it was not used, it was possible to combine HTML and WAP in the same pages although this would render the pages invalid for any other device. Mobile Explorer 2.0 was available on the Benefon Q, Sony CMD-Z5, CMD-J5, CMD-MZ5, CMD-J6, CMD-Z7, CMD-J7 and CMD-J70. With the addition of a messaging kernel and a driver model, this was powerful enough to be the operating system for certain embedded devices. One such device was the Amstrad e-m@iler and e-m@iler 2. This code formed the basis for MME3. Multiple companies offered browsers for the Palm OS platform. The first HTML browser for Palm OS 1.0 was HandWeb by Smartcode software, released in 1997. HandWeb included its own TCP/IP stack, and Smartcode was acquired by Palm in 1999. Mobile browsers for the Palm OS platform multiplied after the release of Palm OS 2.0, which included a TCP/IP stack. A freeware (although later shareware) browser for the Palm OS was Palmscape, written in 1998 by Kazuho Oku in Japan, who went on to found Ilinx. Still in limited use as late as 2003. Qualcomm also developed the Eudora Web browser, and launched it with the Palm OS based QCP smartphone. ProxiWeb was a proxy-based Web browsing solution, developed by Ian Goldberg and others at the University of California Berkeley and later acquired by PumaTech. Released in 2001, Mobile Explorer 3.0 added iMode compatibility (cHTML) plus numerous proprietary schemes. By imaginatively combining these proprietary schemes with WAP protocols, MME3.0 implemented OTA database synchronisation, push email, push information clients (not unlike a 'Today Screen') and PIM functionality. The cancelled Sony Ericsson CMD-Z700 was to feature heavy integration with MME3.0. Although Mobile Explorer was ahead of its time in the mobile phone space, development was stopped in 2002. Also in 2002, Palm, Inc. offered Web Pro on Tungsten PDAs based upon a Novarra browser. PalmSource offered a competing Web browser based on Access Netfront. Opera Software pioneered with its Small Screen Rendering (SSR) and Medium Screen Rendering (MSR) technology. The Opera web browser is able to reformat regular web pages for optimal fit on small screens and medium-sized (PDA) screens. It was also the first widely available mobile browser to support Ajax and the first mobile browser to pass ACID2 test. Distinct from a mobile browser is a web-based emulator, which uses a \\"Virtual Handset\\" to display WAP pages on a computer screen, implemented either in Java or as an HTML transcoder. Popular mobile browsers The following are some of the more popular mobile browsers. Some mobile browsers are really miniaturized web browsers, so some mobile device providers also provide browsers for desktop and laptop computers. {\\"sortable wikitable + Usage share of mobile (smartphone and tablet) browsers for - \\"unsortable\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Source ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date ! scope=\\"col\\"  Android Browser ! scope=\\"col\\"  Chrome ! scope=\\"col\\"  Internet Explorer ! scope=\\"col\\"  Safari ! scope=\\"col\\" Opera Mini ! scope=\\"col\\"  UC Browser ! scope=\\"col\\"  Samsung Internet ! scope=\\"col\\"  Other - !scope=\\"row\\"  StatcounterStatCounter 2017  June 2017  4.24%  47.26%  0.59%  21.17%  5.01%  14.16%  6.03%  1.09% - !scope=\\"row\\"  StatcounterStatCounter 2015  June 2015  15.81%  30.67% 1.76%  24.64%  10.37%  12.95%  --  3.79% - !scope=\\"row\\"  NetApplicationsNetApplications 2014  June 2014  22.77%  16.67%  2.01%  47.06%  7.82%  --  --  4.69% } Default browsers for Mobile and Tablet { \\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: center; width: auto;\\" - !

Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters; recognizing the responsibilities of the states in addressing pollution and providing assistance to states to do so, including funding for publicly owned treatment works for the improvement of wastewater treatment; and maintaining the integrity of wetlands.Jim Hanlon, Mike Cook, Mike Quigley, Bob Wayland. ‚ÄúWater Quality: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. The Clean Water Act was one of the United States' first and most influential modern environmental laws. Its laws and regulations are primarily administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in coordination with state governments, though some of its provisions, such as those involving filling or dredging, are administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Its implementing regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. Subchapters D, N, and O (Parts 100-140, 401-471, and 501-503). Technically, the name of the law is the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.See U.S. EPA, Summary of the Clean Water Act (\\"Clean Water Act\\" is the law's \\"common name,\\" including link to Senate version of the Act with proper title). The first FWPCA was enacted in 1948, but took on its modern form when completely rewritten in 1972 in an act entitled the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972.United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Pub.L. 92-500, October 18, 1972. Major changes have subsequently been introduced via amendatory legislation including the Clean Water Act of 1977Clean Water Act of 1977. Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. and the Water Quality Act (WQA) of 1987.Water Quality Act of 1987. Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. The Clean Water Act does not directly address groundwater contamination. Groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act. Background  Health implications of water pollution  Contamination of drinking water supplies can not only occur in the source water but also in the distribution system. Sources of water contamination include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of water contamination are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants. = Gastrointestinal illness = Gastrointestinal disorders include such conditions as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, perianal abscesses, anal fistulas, perianal infections, diverticular diseases, colitis, colon polyps and cancer. In general, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase). The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65‚Äì74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices. = Reproductive problems = Reproductive problems refer to any illness of the reproductive system. New research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter strengthens the relationship between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. Study identified a group of chemicals that act as anti-androgens in polluted water, which inhibits the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility. = Neurological disorders = Neurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. The new study of more than 700 people in California's Central Valley found that those who likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinson's. The risk was 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with widely used insecticides. Unlike water supplies in large cities, private wells are mostly unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants. Many of them exist at shallow depths of less than 20 yards, and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can flow into ground water. Therefore, private wells are likely to contain pesticides, which can attack developing brains (womb or infancy), leading to neurological diseases later in life. A study led by UCLA epidemiology professor Beate Ritz suggests that \\"people with Parkinson‚Äôs were more likely to have consumed private well water, and had consumed it on average 4.3 years longer than those who did not have the disease.\\" Waters protected All waters with a \\"significant nexus\\" to \\"navigable waters\\" are covered under the CWA; however, the phrase \\"significant nexus\\" remains open to judicial interpretation and considerable controversy. The 1972 statute frequently uses the term \\"navigable waters\\" but also defines the term as \\"waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\\"United States. Clean Water Act (CWA) section 502 (7); . Some regulations interpreting the 1972 law have included water features such as intermittent streams, playa lakes, prairie potholes, sloughs and wetlands as \\"waters of the United States.\\" In 2006, in Rapanos v. United States, a plurality of the US Supreme Court held that the term \\"waters of the United States\\" \\"includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographic features' that are described in ordinary parlance as 'streams[,]... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.'\\" Since Rapanos the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have attempted to define protected waters in the context of Rapanos through the 2015 Clean Water Rule but this has been highly controversial.  Pollution control strategy  Common point source discharges  Point sources  The CWA introduced the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permit system for regulating point sources of pollution.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. \\"National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.\\" Updated 2017-01-15. Point sources include: * industrial facilities (including manufacturing, mining, shipping activities, oil and gas extractionSome oil and gas extraction wastestreams were later exempted from regulations. See EPA, \\"Oil and Gas Stormwater Permitting.\\" Updated 2016-11-01. and service industries). * municipal governments (particularly sewage treatment plants) and other government facilities (such as military bases), and * some agricultural facilities, such as animal feedlots. Point sources may not discharge pollutants to surface waters without an NPDES permit. The system is managed by EPA in partnership with state environmental agencies. EPA has authorized 47 states to issue permits directly to the discharging facilities. The CWA also allows tribes to issue permits, but no tribes have been authorized by EPA. In the remaining states and territories, the permits are issued by an EPA regional office. (See Titles III and IV.) In legislation prior to 1972, Congress had authorized states to develop water quality standards, which would limit discharges from facilities based on the characteristics of individual water bodies. However, those standards were to be developed only for interstate waters, and the science to support that process (i.e. data, methodology) was in the early stages of development. That system was not effective, and there was no permit system in place to enforce the requirements. In the 1972 CWA, Congress added the permit system and a requirement for technology-based effluent limitations.Water Pollution Control Foundation. \\"The Clean Water Act of 1987.\\" Joan M. Kovalic et al. Alexandria, VA, 1987. . In the 2020 Supreme Court case County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the Court also validated that some discharges may not be point sources, but are the \\"functional equivalent of a direct discharge\\" to navigable waters, such as in this case, the injection of wastewater into groundwater injection wells. As of the time of the case's decision, this was not an area the EPA has established regulations for, and the Court instructed the EPA to work with the courts to define such functional equalivents. The Court wrote that this would likely depend most on the distance the pollutants traveled and time to reach navigable waters, with consideration for the material that the pollutants traveled through, any physical or chemical interaction of the pollutants with components in the ground, and how much of the pollutant makes it to the navigable water. = Technology-based standards = The 1972 CWA created a new requirement for technology-based standards for point source discharges. EPA develops those standards for categories of dischargers, based on the performance of pollution control technologies without regard to the conditions of a particular receiving water body. The intent of Congress was to create a \\"level playing field\\" by establishing a basic national discharge standard for all facilities within a category, using a \\"Best Available Technology.\\" The standard becomes the minimum regulatory requirement in a permit. If the national standard is not sufficiently protective at a particular location, then water quality standards may be employed. = Water quality standards = The 1972 act authorized continued use of the water quality-based approach, but in coordination with the technology-based standards. After application of technology-based standards to a permit, if water quality is still impaired for the particular water body, then the permit agency (state or EPA) may add water quality-based limitations to that permit. The additional limitations are to be more stringent than the technology-based limitations and would require the permittee to install additional controls. Water quality standards consist of four basic elements: 1) Designated uses; 2) Water quality criteria; 3) Antidegradation policy and 4) General policies. Designated uses According to water quality standard regulations, federally recognized tribes/nations and states are required to specify appropriate water uses. Identification of appropriate water uses takes into consideration the usage and value of public water supply, protection of fish, wildlife, recreational waters, agricultural, industrial and navigational water ways. Suitability of a water body is examined by states and tribes/nations usages based on physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. States and tribes/nations also examine geographical settings, scenic qualities and economic considerations to determine fitness of designated uses for water bodies. If those standards indicate designated uses to be less than those currently attained, states or tribes are required to revise standards to reflect the uses that are actually being attained. For any body of water with designated uses that do not include \\"fishable/swimmable\\" target use that is identified in section 101(a)(2) of CWA, a \\"Use Attainability Analysis\\" must be conducted. Every three years, such bodies of water must be re-examined to verify if new information is available that demand a revision of the standard. If new information is available that specify ‚Äúfishable/swimmable‚Äù uses can be attained, the use must be designated. Water quality criteria Federally recognized Indigenous Nations and states protect designated areas by adopting water quality criteria that the EPA publishes under ¬ß304(a) of the CWA, modifying the ¬ß304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopting criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as a basis for limiting the toxicity of waste discharges to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on the aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment, and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects. Anti-degradation policy Water quality standards consist of an anti-degradation policy that requires states and tribes to establish a three-tiered anti-degradation program. Anti- degradation procedures identify steps and questions that need to be addressed when specific activities affect water quality. Tier 1 is applicable to all surface waters. It maintains and protects current uses and water quality conditions to support existing uses. Current uses are identified by showing that fishing, swimming, and other water uses have occurred and are suitable since November 28, 1975. Tier 2 maintains and protects water bodies with existing conditions that are better to support CWA 101(a)(2) \\"fishable/swimmable\\" uses. Tier 3 maintains and protects water quality in outstanding national resource waters (ONRWs), which are the highest quality waters in the US with ecological significance. General policies States and Indian tribes adopt general policies pertaining to water quality standards that are subject to review and approval by the EPA. Those provisions on water quality standards include mixing zones, variance, and low flow policies. Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance as part of their water quality standard. Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. Low Flow policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical low flow conditions.  Nonpoint sources  Nonpoint source pollutants, such as sediments, nutrients, pesticides, fertilizers and animal wastes, account for more than half of the pollution in U.S. waters. Congress exempted some water pollution sources from the point source definition in the 1972 CWA and was unclear on the status of some other sources. Such sources were therefore considered to be nonpoint sources that were not subject to the permit program. Agricultural stormwater discharges and irrigation return flows were specifically exempted from permit requirements.CWA 502(14), . Congress, however, provided support for research, technical and financial assistance programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve runoff management practices on farms. See Natural Resources Conservation Service. Map of municipal separate storm sewer systems Stormwater runoff from industrial sources, municipal storm drains, and other sources were not specifically addressed in the 1972 law. EPA had declined to include urban runoff and industrial stormwater discharges in its initial implementation of the NPDES program, and subsequently the agency was sued by an environmental group. In 1977, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that stormwater discharges must be covered by the permit program.Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train, 396 F.Supp. 1393 (D.D.C. 1975), aff'd. by NRDC v. Costle, 568 F.2d 1369 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Research conducted starting in the late 1970s and 1980s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the US. In the early 1980s, the EPA conducted the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) to document the extent of the urban stormwater problem. The agency began to develop regulations for stormwater permit coverage but encountered resistance from industry and municipalities, and there were additional rounds of litigation. The litigation was pending when Congress considered further amendments to the CWA in 1986. In the Water Quality Act of 1987, Congress responded to the stormwater problem by defining industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems (often called \\"MS4\\") as point sources, and requiring them to obtain NPDES permits, by specific deadlines. The permit exemption for agricultural discharges continued, but Congress created several programs and grants, including a demonstration grant program at the EPA to expand the research and development of non point controls and management practices.  Financing of pollution controls  Congress created a major public works financing program for municipal sewage treatment in the 1972 CWA. A system of grants for construction of municipal sewage treatment plants was authorized and funded in Title II. In the initial program, the federal portion of each grant was up to 75 percent of a facility's capital cost, with the remainder financed by the state. In subsequent amendments Congress reduced the federal proportion of the grants and in the 1987 WQA transitioned to a revolving loan program in Title VI. Industrial and other private facilities are required to finance their own treatment improvements on the \\"polluter pays\\" principle. = Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act = Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously-authorized revolving fund unter CWA Title VI.United States. Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. , title V, ¬ß5022. Approved 2014-06-10. Pursuant to WIFIA, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including public‚Äìprivate partnerships. Congress amended the WIFIA program in 2015 and 2016.United States. 1\\\\. Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. , ¬ß1445. Approved 2015-12-04. 2\\\\. Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016. , ¬ß5008. Approved 2016-12-16.  Major statutory provisions  This Act has six titles.  Title I - Research and Related Programs  Title I includes a Declaration of Goals and PolicyCWA 101, . and various grant authorizations for research programs and pollution control programs. Some of the programs authorized by the 1972 law are ongoing (e.g. section 104 research programs, section 106 pollution control programs, section 117 Chesapeake Bay Program) while other programs no longer receive funds from Congress and have been discontinued.  Title II - Grants for Construction of Treatment Works  The construction grants program funded new sewage treatment plants and upgrading existing plants to national secondary treatment standards. To assist municipalities in building or expanding sewage treatment plants, also known as publicly owned treatment works (POTW), Title II established a system of construction grants. The 1972 CWA provided that federal funds would support 75% of project costs, with state and local funds providing the remaining 25%. In 1981 Congress reduced the federal funding proportion for most grants to 55%. Clean Water Act Amendments of 1981, , Sec. 7. Approved 1981-12-29. The construction grant program was replaced by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund in the 1987 WQA (see Title VI), although some local utilities continued to receive \\"special purpose project grants\\" directly from Congress, through a budgetary procedure known as \\"earmarking.\\"  Title III - Standards and enforcement  =Discharge permits required= Section 301 of the Act prohibits discharges to waters of the U.S. except with a permit.CWA 301(a), . (See Title IV for discussion of permit programs.) Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement Best Management Practices to control their discharges.CWA 402(r), . This provision was added by the Clean Boating Act of 2008, , July 29, 2008. (See Regulation of ship pollution in the United States.) = Technology-Based Standards Program = Under the 1972 act EPA began to issue technology-based standards for municipal and industrial sources. * Municipal sewage treatment plants (POTW) are required to meet secondary treatment standards.CWA 304(d)(1), and \\"Secondary Treatment Regulation\\", Code of Federal Regulations, . * Effluent guidelines (for existing sources) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are issued for categories of industrial facilities discharging directly to surface waters.CWA 301, ; CWA 304(b), ; and CWA 306, . Regulations at 40 CFR Subchapter N. * Categorical Pretreatment Standards are issued to industrial users (also called \\"indirect dischargers\\") contributing wastes to POTW.CWA 307(b), ; and CWA 307(c), . 40 CFR Subchapter N. These standards are developed in conjunction with the effluent guidelines program. As with effluent guidelines and NSPS, pretreatment standards consists of Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) and Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS). There are 28 categories with pretreatment standards as of 2020. As of 2020 the effluent guidelines and categorical pretreatment standards regulations have been published for 59 categories and apply to approximately 40,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation's waters, 129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites. These regulations are responsible for preventing the discharge of almost 700 billion pounds of pollutants each year. EPA has updated some categories since their initial promulgation and has added new categories. The secondary treatment standards for POTWs and the effluent guidelines are implemented through NPDES permits. (See Title IV.) The categorical pretreatment standards are typically implemented by POTWs through permits that they issue to their industrial users. = Water Quality Standards Program = The framework that came out of the Clean Water Act to be implemented by the EPA and states includes states monitoring their water bodies and establishing Water Quality Standards for them. Water Quality Standards (WQS) are risk-based requirements which set site-specific allowable pollutant levels for individual water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. States set WQS by designating uses for the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply, aquatic life, agriculture) and applying water quality criteria (numeric pollutant concentrations and narrative requirements) to protect the designated uses. An antidegradation policy is also issued by each state to maintain and protect existing uses and high quality waters. If a state fails to issue WQS, EPA is required to issue standards for that state.CWA 303(b), Water bodies that do not meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards. Water bodies on the 303(d) list require development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS. The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS) Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half. Following the issuance of a TMDL for a water body, implementation of the requirements involves modification to NPDES permits for facilities discharging to the water body to meet the WLA allocated to the water body (see Title IV). The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state agencies. More than half of U.S. stream and river miles continue to violate water quality standards. Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nation's coastlines, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired. = National Water Quality Inventory = The primary mode of informing the quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report. Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress as a means to inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes.CWA 305(b), . The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act. = Enforcement = Under section 309, EPA can issue administrative orders against violators, and seek civil or criminal penalties when necessary.CWA 309, . *For a first offense of criminal negligence, the minimum fine is $2,500, with a maximum of $25,000 fine per day of violation. A violator may also receive up to a year in jail. On a second offense, a maximum fine of $50,000 per day may be issued. *For a knowing endangerment violation, i.e. placing another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, a fine may be issued up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 15 years for an individual, or up to $1,000,000 for an organization. States that are authorized by EPA to administer the NPDES program must have authority to enforce permit requirements under their respective state laws. = Federal facilities = Military bases, national parks and other federal facilities must comply with CWA provisions.CWA 313, . = Thermal pollution = Section 316 requires standards for thermal pollution discharges, as well as standards for cooling water intake structures (e.g., fish screens).. These standards are applicable to power plants and other industrial facilities. = Nonpoint Source Management Program = The 1987 amendments created the Nonpoint Source Management Program under CWA section 319.. This program provides grants to states, territories and Indian tribes to support demonstration projects, technology transfer, education, training, technical assistance and related activities designed to reduce nonpoint source pollution. Grant funding for the program averaged $210 million annually for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008.EPA. \\"Clean Water Act Section 319(h) Grant Funds History.\\" Accessed 2008-07-28.  Title IV - Permits and licenses  =State certification of compliance= States are required to certify that discharges authorized by federal permits will not violate the state's water quality standards.CWA 401, . = NPDES permits for point sources = The NPDES permits program is authorized by CWA section 402.. The initial permits issued in the 1970s and early 1980s focused on POTWs and industrial wastewater‚Äîtypically \\"process\\" wastewater and cooling water where applicable, and in some cases, industrial stormwater. The 1987 WQA expanded the program to cover stormwater discharges explicitly, both from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) and industrial sources.CWA 402(p), . The MS4 NPDES permits require regulated municipalities to use Best Management Practices to reduce pollutants to the \\"Maximum Extent Practicable.\\" MS4s serve over 80% of the US population and provide drainage for 4% of the land area. POTWs with combined sewers are required to comply with the national Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994.United States. Wet Weather Quality Act of 2000, Section 112 of Division B, , December 21, 2000. Added CWA section 402(q), . The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems.EPA (1994-04-19). \\"Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy.\\" Federal Register, 59 FR 18688. About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people. Non-stormwater permits typically include numeric effluent limitations for specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration allowed in the discharge, e.g., 30 mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes a violation of the permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non- stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment. In 2012, EPA estimated that there are over 500,000 stormwater permittees. This number includes permanent facilities such as municipal (POTW, MS4) and industrial plants, and construction sites, which are temporary stormwater dischargers. =Dredge and fill permits = Section 404 requires that a discharger of dredged or fill material obtain a permit, unless the activity is eligible for an exemption.CWA section 404. Essentially, all discharges affecting the bottom elevation of a jurisdictional water body require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). These permits are an essential part of protecting streams and wetlands, which are often filled by land developers. Wetlands are vital to the ecosystem in filtering streams and rivers and providing habitat for wildlife. There are two main types of wetlands permits: general permits and individual permits. General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the \\"Nationwide Permits\\") are issued for fill activities that will result in minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a general permit, or that do not meet the conditions of a General Permit. In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit. When the USACE processes an application for an Individual Permit, it must issue a public notice describing the proposed action described in the permit application. Although the Corps District Engineer makes the decision to grant a permit, the EPA Administrator may veto a permit if it is not reasonable. Before making such a decision, however, EPA must consult with the USACE. A USACE permit typically expires after five years. Mountaintop removal mining requires a section 404 permit when soil and rock from the mining operation is placed in streams and wetlands (commonly called a \\"valley fill\\"). Pollutant discharges from valley fills to streams also requires an NPDES permit. Exemptions After passage of the CWA in 1972, a controversy arose as to the application of section 404 to agriculture and certain other activities. The Act was interpreted by some to place restrictions on virtually all placement of dredged materials in wetlands and other waters of the United States, raising concern that the federal government was about to place all agricultural activities under the jurisdiction of USACE. For opponents of the Act, section 404 had, as a result of this concern, become a symbol of dramatic over-regulation.U.S. Congress. Senate. Committee on Public Works (1978). \\"A Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977.\\" Serial No. 95-14. Vol. 4. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. When Congress considered the 1977 CWA Amendments, a significant issue was to ensure that certain agricultural activities and other selected activities, could continue without the government's supervision‚Äîin other words, completely outside the regulatory or permit jurisdiction of any federal agency. The 1977 amendments included a set of six section 404 exemptions. For example, totally new activities such as construction of farm roads, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(E), construction of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, and minor agricultural drainage, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(A), all are exempted by Statute. Section 1344(f)(1)(C), which exempts discharge of dredged material ‚Äúfor the purpose of... the maintenance of drainage ditches.‚Äù All of these exemptions were envisioned to be self-executing, that is not technically requiring an administrative no-jurisdiction determination. One such example was the maintenance of agricultural drainage ditches. Throughout the hearing process, Congressmen of every environmental persuasion repeatedly stated that the over $5 Billion invested in drainage facilities could be maintained without government regulation of any kind. Senator Edmund Muskie, for example, explained that exempt activities such as agricultural drainage would be entirely unregulated. Other exemptions were granted as well, including exemptions for normal farming activities. Importance of no-jurisdiction determinations Although Congress envisioned a set of self-executing exemptions, it has become common for landowners to seek no-jurisdiction determinations from the USACE. A landowner who intends to make substantial investments in acquisition or improvement of land might lawfully proceed with exempt activity, a permit not being required. The problem is that if the landowner's assumptions were incorrect and the activity later determined not to be exempt, the USACE will issue a cease and desist order. Obtaining an advanced ruling provides some level of comfort that the activities will have been deemed conducted in good faith. Recapture of exemptions Because some of the six exemptions involved new activities, such as minor drainage and silviculture (the clearing of forests by the timber industry), Congress recognized the need to impose some limitations on exemptions. Consequently, Congress placed the so-called recapture clause limitation on these new project exemptions. Under section 404(f)(2), such new projects would be deprived of their exemption if all of the following three characteristics could be shown: # A discharge of dredge or fill material in the navigable waters of the United States; # The discharge is incidental to an activity having as its purpose the bringing of an area of navigable waters into a use to which it was not previously subject, and # Where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters may be reduced. To remove the exemption, all of these requirements must be fulfilled‚Äîthe discharge, the project purpose of bringing an area into a use to which it was not previously subject, and the impairment or reduction of navigable waters. = POTW Biosolids Management Program = The 1987 WQA created a program for management of biosolids (sludge) generated by POTWs.CWA 405, . The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage sludge or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage sludge, including disposal; (2) Specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs. . The term biosolids is used to differentiate treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. The quality of sewage sludge is controlled under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants and those that do not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it. Standards are set for sewage sludge generated or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs are referred to as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non- agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.  Title V - General Provisions  = Citizen suits = Any U.S. citizen may file a citizen suit against any person who has allegedly violated an effluent standard or limitation (i.e., a provision in an NPDES permit) or against the EPA Administrator if the Administrator failed to perform any non-discretionary act or duty required by the CWA.CWA 505, = Employee protection = The CWA includes an employee (\\"whistleblower\\") protection provision. Employees in the U.S. who believe they were fired or suffered adverse action related to enforcement of the CWA may file a written complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.CWA 507, .  Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds  The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program was authorized by the 1987 WQA.CWA 601, et seq. This replaced the municipal construction grants program, which was authorized in the 1972 law under Title II. In the CWSRF, federal funds are provided to the states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their respective revolving funds, which are used to provide financial assistance (loans or grants) to local governments for wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection. The fund provides loans to municipalities at lower-than-market rates. The program's average interest rate was 1.4 percent nationwide in 2017, compared to an average market rate of 3.5 percent. In 2017, CWSRF assistance totaling $7.4 billion was provided to 1,484 local projects across the country.  Earlier legislation  During the 1880s and 1890s, Congress directed USACE to prevent dumping and filling in the nation's harbors, and the program was vigorously enforced.United States Army Corps of Engineers, Washington, DC. \\"Environmental Activities.\\" Brief History of the Corps. Accessed 2013-10-19. Congress first addressed water pollution issues in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899,Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Ch. 425, Sec. 9, 30 Stat. 1151. . March 3, 1899 giving the Corps the authority to regulate most kinds of obstructions to navigation, including hazards resulting from effluents. Portions of this law remain in effect, including Section 13, the so-called Refuse Act. In 1910, USACE used the act to object to a proposed sewer in New York City, but a court ruled that pollution control was a matter left to the states alone. Speaking to the 1911 National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the chief of the Corps, Brigadier General William H. Bixby, suggested that modern treatment facilities and prohibitions on dumping \\"should either be made compulsory or at least encouraged everywhere in the United States.\\" Most legal analysts have concluded that the 1899 law did not address environmental impacts from pollution, such as sewage or industrial discharges. However, there were several pollution enforcement cases in the 1960s and 1970s where the law was cited for broader pollution control objectives. Some sections of the 1899 act have been superseded by various amendments, including the 1972 CWA, while other notable legislative predecessors include: * Public Health Service Act of 1912 expanded the mission of the United States Public Health Service to study problems of sanitation, sewage and pollution., August 14, 1912. * Oil Pollution Act of 1924 prohibited the intentional discharge of fuel oil into tidal waters43 Stat. 604. and provided authorization for USACE to apprehend violators. This was repealed by the 1972 CWA, reducing the Corps' role in pollution control to the discharge of dredged or fill material. * Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 created a comprehensive set of water quality programs that also provided some financing for state and local governments. Enforcement was limited to interstate waters. The Public Health Service provided financial and technical assistance.. * Water Quality Act of 1965 required states to issue water quality standards for interstate waters, and authorized the newly created Federal Water Pollution Control Administration to set standards where states failed to do so.. When EPA first opened its doors in 1970, the agency had weak authority to protect U.S. waters, lacking the legal power to write effluent guidelines and possessing only general authority to require secondary treatment from industrial dischargers.EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, Video, Transcript (see p1). The 1969 burning Cuyahoga River had sparked national outrage; the Act grew out of it. In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney Robert Jones (Ohio lawyer) began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. It was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The Attorney General of the United States, John N. Mitchell, gave a Press Conference December 18, 1970 referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a lawsuit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. It was largely based on these and other litigation experiences that criteria for new legislation were identified.  Case law  *United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. (1985). The Supreme Court upheld the Act's coverage in regulating wetlands that intermingle with navigable waters.U.S. Supreme Court. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, . This ruling was revised by the 2006 Rapanos decision. *Edward Hanousek, Jr v. United States (9th Cir. Court of Appeals, 1996; certiorari denied, 2000). In 1994, during rock removal operations, a backhoe operator accidentally struck a petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks.

Amendment  * America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018United States. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. . October 23, 2018.  Effects  To date, the water quality goals stated by Congress in the 1972 act have not been achieved by American society: * \\"to make all U.S. waters fishable and swimmable by 1983;\\" * \\"to have zero water pollution discharge by 1985;\\" * \\"to prohibit discharge of toxic amounts of toxic pollutants\\". More than half of U.S. stream and river miles, about 70 percent of lakes, ponds and reservoirs, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas continue to violate water quality standards. The reasons for the impairment vary by location; major sources are agriculture, industry and communities (typically through urban runoff). Some of these pollution sources are difficult to control through national regulatory programs. However, since the passage of the 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. The law has resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters are drinking water sources. In many watersheds nutrient pollution (excess nitrogen and phosphorus) has become a major problem. It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain. A 2015 paper acknowledges that the CWA has been effective in controlling point sources, but that it has not effective with nonpoint sources, and argues that the law must be updated to address the nation's current water quality problems. A 2017 working paper finds that \\"most types of water pollution declined [over the period 1962-2001], though the rate of decrease slowed over time... Our finding of decreases in most pollutants implies that the prevalence of such violations was even greater before the Clean Water Act.\\" Several studies have estimated that the costs of the CWA (including the expenditures for the Title II construction grants program) are higher than the benefits. An EPA study had similar findings, but acknowledged that several kinds of benefits were unmeasured. A 2018 study argues that \\"available estimates of the costs and benefits of water pollution control programs [including the CWA] are incomplete and do not conclusively determine the net benefits of surface water quality.\\"  See also  * Great Lakes Areas of Concern * Ocean Dumping Act * Water supply and sanitation in the United States * Oil Pollution Act of 1990 References * External links ;CWA text and analysis * * Clean Water Act - Full text with amendments through 2011-01-04.

At one time it was considered to be a subspecies of the red-breasted flycatcher, Ficedula parva. This is an insectivorous species which breeds in the north-west Himalayas in the Kashmir region of the Indian Subcontinent. It is migratory and winters in the hills of central Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats of India. Kashmir flycatcher, Ooty, Tamil Nadu India The Kashmir flycatcher breeds in deciduous forest with dense undergrowth, nesting in a hole in a tree and laying 3-5 eggs which are incubated by the female. It winters in gardens, tea estates, forest edges, and open areas within forest, generally above 750 m. Most individuals leave the breeding grounds in September, arriving in Sri Lanka in October and departing again in late March. One of the best places to see this rare species is Victoria Park in Nuwara Eliya. This species is 13 cm long. It is similar in shape to the slightly smaller red-breasted flycatcher. The male has a grey- brown back with an orange-red throat, breast and flanks, bordered with black on the throat and breast. Females and first-winter birds have slightly browner upperparts, and the red of the underparts may be reduced to just a pinkish wash. The male of the similar taiga flycatcher, Ficedula albicilla, has the reddish-orange area limited to the throat and the top of the breast, and lacks the black border. The song is a short melodic sweet-eet sweet-eet-did-he, and the call is a sharp chak. This is a vulnerable species with a decreasing population and breeding range, which is also severely fragmented as a result of the destruction of temperate mixed deciduous forests by commercial timber extraction, agriculture and livestock grazing. The population is thought to be between 2,500 and 10,000 birds.

They are excellent examples of rock-cut architecture and one of the three most famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China. The others are Longmen and Mogao. The site is located about 16 km west of the city of Datong, in the valley of the Shi Li river at the base of the Wuzhou Shan mountains. They are an outstanding example of the Chinese stone carvings from the 5th and 6th centuries. There are 53 major caves, along with 51,000 niches housing the same number of Buddha statues. Additionally, there are around 1,100 minor caves. A Ming Dynasty-era fort is still located on top of the cliff housing the Yungang Grottoes. The grottoes were excavated in the south face of a sandstone cliff about 2600 feet long and 30 to 60 feet high. In 2001, the Yungang Grottoes were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Yungang Grottoes are considered by UNESCO to be a \\"masterpiece of early Chinese Buddhist cave art... [and] ...represent the successful fusion of Buddhist religious symbolic art from south and central Asia with Chinese cultural traditions, starting in the 5th century CE under Imperial auspices.\\" It is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. History Cave 9 After the decline of the Jin Dynasty, the northern parts of China came under the control of the Tuoba-ruled Northern Wei. They made the city of Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé), now known as Datong (Â§ßÂêå), their capital. Due to its promotion, Pingcheng saw an increase in construction work. The Northern Wei early adopted Buddhism as their state religion. Buddhism arrived in this location via travel on the ancient North Silk Road, the northernmost route of about 2600 kilometres in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerging in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia. Silk Road, North China, C.Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham, 2007] The work on this first period of carving lasted until the year 465 AD, and the caves are now known as caves 16-20\\\\. Beginning around the year 471 AD, in a second construction phase that lasted until 494 AD, the twin caves 5/6, 7/8, and 9/10 as well as the caves 11, 12, and probably 13 were constructed under the supervision and support of the imperial court. The imperial patronage ended 494 AD with the move of the Wei court to the new capital of Luoyang. All other caves emerged under private patronage in a third construction period, lasting until 525, when the construction came to a final halt due to uprisings in the area.  Deterioration and Conservation  Since the end of the works, the sandstone of the grottoes has been exposed to heavy weathering. Many of the grottoes are exposed to the open air, and are therefore vulnerable to various forms of pollution and deterioration. Windblown dust and air pollution from the industrial city of Datong, as well as dust from mines and highways near the site pose a threat to the preservation of the ancient statues. The site is also in proximity of the Gobi Desert, the storms of which can contribute to the decay of the statues. The ensuing centuries therefore saw several attempts to preserve the caves and to repair sustained damage. During the Liao Dynasty the caves saw some renewing of statues and the buildup of the \\"10 temples of Yungang\\" from 1049 to 1060, that were meant to protect the main caves. However, they were destroyed again just some 60 years later in a fire. The wooden buildings extant in front of caves 5 and 6 were constructed in 1621, during the early Qing Dynasty. Since the 1950s, cracks in the sandstone have been sealed by grouting, and forestation has been implemented in an effort to reduce the weathering due to sandstorms.report of the UNESCO advisory board During April and May 1991, Caltech personnel conducted air pollutant measurement experiments in the Yungang Grottoes. It was found that nearly all of the airborne matter was mineral dust or carbon particles, allowing a focus of attention on sources of these kinds of matter.  Cave 6  Cave 6 is one of the richest of the Yungang sites. It was constructed between 465 and 494 C.E. by Emperor Xiao Wen. The cave‚Äôs surface area is approximately 1,000 square meters. The entire interior of the cave is carved and painted. There is a stupa pillar in the center of the room extending from the floor to the ceiling. The walls are divided into two stories. The walls of the upper stories are host to carvings of standing Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and monks among other celestial figures. All of the carvings were painted, but because the caves have been repainted evidently up to twelve times, determining the original scheme is difficult.

Delta 4 designed games between 1984 and 1992. Some were self-published, others were released by CRL Group, Piranha, Silversoft, or On-Line Entertainment. Delta 4 were also credited with providing the code for Jonathan Nash's tape magazine YS2 which was given away free with Your Sinclair magazine and published by Future Publishing.  History  Delta 4 was formed by McNeill with a few friends whilst still at school. Their debut text adventure games were the Dragonstar trilogy (\\"...like Classic Adventure but without the interesting bits.\\") and two Holy Joystick comedy adventures, self-published in 1984. Gilsoft's The Quill was the design software. Their first critical success was Bored of the Rings, inspired by the Harvard Lampoon novel of the same name. Published in 1985, it received a Sinclair User Classic award. They also published Robin of Sherlock. In the early 1990s, Delta 4 developed several CD based games. The Town with No Name, Psycho Killer and The Hound of the Baskervilles were all developed using D.U.N.E. (Developers Universal Non-programming Environment) and all games were panned by both critics and players.

A version for MS-DOS was released in 1993. The game stars \\"The Man with No Name\\" (no relation to the film character of the same name portrayed by Clint Eastwood), who gets off a train at the station in the eponymous town. Upon entering the town, he is quickly confronted by a gunman. Once No Name kills the gunman, an unnamed man with a cigarillo who more closely resembles Eastwood's character reveals that the gunman was the littlest brother of Evil Eb, the leader of the Hole-in-the-Head Gang, and foreshadows that Eb will send his bandits after No Name. No Name then explores each of the town's buildings, either by interacting with the town's residents or by playing minigames, and duels with gang members usually after leaving the buildings. After killing every outlaw except Evil Eb, No Name confronts Eb himself but only shoots off his hat. Eb, having dropped his gun in surprise and resigning to his defeat, asks No Name to kill him, believing him to be a man called Billy-Bob. No Name explains that he is not Billy-Bob and came to town to meet his sister, believing he is in a town called Dodge Gulch. Eb tells him in turn that Dodge Gulch is actually \\"20 miles down the line\\" from where they are. No Name spares Eb because of their misunderstanding each other, and the two become friends in the end over whiskey. In an alternate ending to the game, No Name can leave on the train that brought him into town. As the train departs, a small boy yells, \\"Come back, Shane!\\", prompting No Name to shoot the child and tell him that his name is not Shane before the train flies away into outer space. The gameplay is divided into two forms: 1) a point-and-click format with menus containing multiple options, followed by short animated scenes based on the player's selections; 2) a first-person shooter-type interface where the player must quickly shoot a target before the target shoots back, ending the game in defeat.  Psycho Killer  The first out of many quick-time events in Psycho Killer. In order to proceed, the player must click the brake with the mouse button in order to stop the car. If the player fails in doing this in time the protagonist drives into the idle car, making it explode and triggering a game over. Psycho Killer is a graphic action-adventure game released by On-Line Entertainment in 1992 for the Commodore CDTV. A version for MS-DOS was released in 1993. The game involves an unnamed protagonist going on a quest in order to save a woman from a murderer, and to save himself. The graphics for the game were created using digitised still photographs that were taken in the suburbs of London. Gameplay of Psycho Killer is restricted to a point-and-click interface, such as clicking certain arrows to go their respective direction. There are multiple times in the game where the player must respond promptly to a quick time event in order to proceed to the next scene. Failure to do so can result in the game ending with the protagonist's death. In issue 32 of Amiga Format, the reviewer gave the game 13% and complained of \\"poor gameplay\\", comparing it to an \\"interactive home movie\\" and asked who would want to play a game featuring a \\"spotty herbert who drives a Vauxhall Chevette\\". The game was reviewed again in issue 39 of the same magazine; the review gave it the same score, Alt URL and complained again about the poor gameplay. Amiga Joker reviewed the game more positively. The magazine gave the game a 3/5, stating, \\"with a little bit of goodwill, the game could be described as a interactive movie\\". The magazine ended the review calling the game \\"the best pure CD game ever.\\" Amiga Magazine also reviewed the game positively, but did not give a score. The magazine spoke about the \\"forgiving reaction time\\". The magazine also said that the game is well-tuned to the CDTV. The magazine complained that the mouse pointer was black which made it \\"impossible to see\\" during some scenes.

Prince Sattva was one of the previous incarnations of Gautama Buddha, according to a jataka story. The son of King Maharatha, he became an ascetic and gained a few disciples. On his walk with his closest disciple, he comes to the edge of a cliff, at the bottom of which is a starving tigress about to eat her newborn cubs in desperation. The bodhisattva tells his disciple to go look for food and he will stay and try to figure out a way to save her and her young. While his disciple is gone, the bodhisattva reflects that while his disciple very well may not find food, his body is just so much flesh as the tradition states, and by giving it up, he can save the tigress' purity and her cubs' lives. He leaps off the cliff to his death, attracting the tigress' attention with his impact, and she eats his body. In this way, he comes closer to perfecting some of the ten Buddhist perfections, those of generosity, renunciation, morality, resolution and equanimity. His disciple returns, having not found food, and, upon discovering what the bodhisattva has done, rejoices in his good deed. He comes back with other disciples and they and the heavens shower the spot with lotus flowers.

Launched in 1957, it was both the world's first nuclear-powered surface ship and the first nuclear- powered civilian vessel. Lenin entered operation in 1959 and worked clearing sea routes for cargo ships along Russia's northern coast. From 1960 to 1965 the ship covered over 85,000 miles during the Arctic navigation season, of which almost 65,000 were through ice. Nuclear power proved to be an ideal technology for a vessel working in such a remote area as it removed the need for regular replenishment of fuel. On April 10, 1974 the vessel was awarded the Order of Lenin. It was officially decommissioned in 1989. It was subsequently converted to a museum ship and is now permanently based at Murmansk. Propulsion Primorsk where Lenin had sea trials When launched in 1957, Lenin was powered by three OK-150 reactors. In its late-1960s configuration, at full capacity the ship used five to six pounds of uranium-235 per 100 days. In the configuration employed from 1970, two OK-900 reactors provided steam for four steam turbines, that were in turn connected to generators, which powered three sets of electric motors to drive the ship's three propellers. Nuclear accidents In February 1965, there was a loss-of- coolant accident. After being shut down for refueling, the coolant was removed from the number two reactor before the spent fuel had been removed. As a result, some of the fuel elements melted and deformed inside the reactor. When the spent elements were being unloaded for storage and disposal, it was found that 124 fuel assemblies (about 60% of the total) were stuck in the reactor core. It was decided to remove the fuel, control grid, and control rods as a unit for disposal; they were placed in a special cask, solidified, stored for two years, and dumped in Tsivolki Bay (near the Novaya Zemlya archipelago) in 1967. The second accident was a cooling system leak which occurred in 1967, shortly after refueling. Finding the leak required breaking through the concrete and metal biological shield with sledgehammers. Once the leak was found, it became apparent that the sledgehammer damage could not be repaired; subsequently, all three reactors were removed by blowing them off the ship with shaped charges above a burial site off Novaya Zemlya,–í—ã–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–∞ –∞—Ç–æ–º–Ω–æ–π —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏ –û–ö ‚Äì 150 —Å –ª–µ–¥–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞ ¬´–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω¬ª. and replaced by two OK-900 reactors.

Small business programs could be developed and debugged rapidly with Business Basic because of the interactive nature of the interpreter, but the language did not provide many structured programming features, and as programs grew larger, maintenance became a problem. There was limited memory space for Business Basic programs on the Nova, and programmers often resorted to tricks such as self-modifying programs, which was easy to program in Business Basic, but complicated to debug. The original version of the language was \\"double precision\\", i.e. 32-bit (and so each integer used two 16-bit Nova words). When Data General ported the language to the MV line, they included two copies of the language, one \\"double precision\\", and one \\"triple precision\\". Unfortunately the two were incompatible with each other in subtle ways. Although Data General improved the language in some ways, such as adding multiple-line IF THEN ELSE END IF statements, they failed to lift many of the constraints of the language on the MV machines, such as a 9,999 line maximum, 384 variable limit, and maximum of 16 open files. Competing BASICs An early competitor to Data General's Business Basic was Bluebird Business Basic, a compiled language running on its proprietary SuperDOS (Bluebird) platform. Bluebird's Basic was not fully compatible with Data General's. B32 Business Basic was a highly compatible interpreter which ran on the Eclipse MV line. It lifted many of the Data General Business Basic constraints, and ran significantly faster by using the full power of the 32-bit processor. B32 stored all variables internally as 64-bit, and emulated double and triple precision as required. It also provided new language features. B32 was ported to Unix and later to DOS, allowing Data General's customers to readily move to other hardware vendors. B32 also had substantial compatibility with Bluebird Business Basic. Transoft produced another competitor to Data General's Business Basic, Universal Business Basic. UBB ran on Unix and DOS, and was substantially compatible with Data General's Business Basic. Transoft purchased B32 in 1992. Data General ported Business Basic to the AViiON, but B32 and UBB were already available on that platform. Data General's programmers did have one major success on the AViiON when they unveiled a new version of Business Basic at a \\"shootout\\" between themselves, B32 and UBB. Data General had added a caching mechanism to speed up their Business Basic's disk access, and it outperformed the other companies' products. Within a month, B32 and UBB had added their own caching mechanisms, and drawn ahead of Data General again. Transoft's UBB is now sold as the Universal Business Language.

It is the most common academic degree in seminaries and divinity schools (e.g. in 2014 nearly 44 percent of all US students in schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools were enrolled in an M.Div. program). In many Christian denominations and in some other religions the degree is the standard prerequisite for ordination or licensing to professional ministry. At accredited seminaries in the United States this degree requires between 72 and 106 credit hours of study (72 being the minimum determined by academic accrediting agencies and 106 being on the upper end of certain schools that wish to ensure a broader study of the related disciplines). Christian M.Div. programs generally include studies in Christian ministry and theology. In 1996 the Association of Theological Schools established the standard that all accredited M.Div. programs should include the following four content areas: Religious Heritage, Cultural Context, Personal and Spiritual Formation, and Capacity for Ministerial and Public Leadership. Coursework usually includes studies in New Testament Greek, theology, philosophy, church history, pastoral theology, Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), and New Testament studies. Many programs also contain courses in church growth, ecclesiology, evangelism, systematic theology, Christian education, liturgical studies, Latin, Hebrew, canon law, and patristics.For an example of an MDiv degree outline see The degree may or may not include a thesis. Requirement for ordination The M.Div. is a requirement for ordination in many denominations. For example, the United Methodist Church, one of the largest Protestant Christian denominations in the US, whose students in 2014 made up 9% of all M.Div. students enrolled in schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, requires candidates for ordination as elder to earn an M.Div. and requires candidates for ordination as deacon to earn either an M.Div. or a master's degree in another field with additional theological studies. Contemporary usage The Master of Divinity has replaced the Bachelor of Divinity in most United States seminaries as the first professional degree, since the former title implied in the American academic system that it was on a par with a Bachelor of Arts or other basic undergraduate education even though a bachelor's degree previously was and remains a prerequisite for entrance into graduate divinity programs. The Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada accredits most Christian schools in North America and approves the degree programs they offer, including the M.Div. The M.Div. is a significantly more extensive program than most taught (as opposed to research- based) master's degrees. In the United States the degree usually consists on average of 90 semester hours, as opposed to the usual 36 or 48. Ordination in most mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church thus requires seven or eight years of education past high school: the first four in undergraduate studies leading to a bachelor's degree (which may or may not be in a related field) and then three or four years of seminary or divinity school education leading to the M.Div.. The M.Div. stands in contrast to the Master of Arts (MA) in theology and Master of Theological Studies (MTS), the usual academic degrees in the subject (which tend not to include \\"pastoral\\" or \\"practical\\" courses), and the Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB), Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL), Master of Theology (MTh), Master of Sacred Theology (STM), and Master of Religion (MRel), which are also academic degrees. Schools with Pontifical faculties in North America often award both the M.Div. and STB at the same time after a three-year period of graduate studies. Enrollment differences between genders Although in 2014 women made up approximately 53% of all students enrolled in ministerial non-M.Div. degree programs at US schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, they constituted only approximately 29% of all M.Div. students in the same schools in that year. The group with the most parity in M.Div. enrollment numbers between men and women at those schools in that time period were African American students, among whom enrollment numbers were almost equal between genders. Cost For the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year the average cost per year for M.Div. tuition and fees at a school accredited by the Association of Theological Schools was $14,673.50 in the US and $9,493.25 in Canada.

Many languages admit both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, while some languages admit only ambiguous grammars. Any non-empty language admits an ambiguous grammar by taking an unambiguous grammar and introducing a duplicate rule or synonym (the only language without ambiguous grammars is the empty language). A language that only admits ambiguous grammars is called an inherently ambiguous language, and there are inherently ambiguous context-free languages. Deterministic context-free grammars are always unambiguous, and are an important subclass of unambiguous grammars; there are non-deterministic unambiguous grammars, however. For computer programming languages, the reference grammar is often ambiguous, due to issues such as the dangling else problem. If present, these ambiguities are generally resolved by adding precedence rules or other context-sensitive parsing rules, so the overall phrase grammar is unambiguous. Some parsing algorithms (such as (Earley or GLR parsers) can generate sets of parse trees (or \\"parse forests\\") from strings that are syntactically ambiguous.Tomita, Masaru. \\"An efficient augmented- context-free parsing algorithm.\\" Computational linguistics 13.1-2 (1987): 31-46. Examples Trivial language The simplest example is the following ambiguous grammar for the trivial language, which consists of only the empty string: :A ‚Üí A  Œµ ‚Ä¶meaning that a production can either be itself again, or the empty string. Thus the empty string has leftmost derivations of length 1, 2, 3, and indeed of any length, depending on how many times the rule A ‚Üí A is used. This language also has the unambiguous grammar, consisting of a single production rule: :A ‚Üí Œµ ‚Ä¶meaning that the unique production can only produce the empty string, which is the unique string in the language. In the same way, any grammar for a non-empty language can be made ambiguous by adding duplicates. Unary string The regular language of unary strings of a given character, say \`'a'\` (the regular expression \`a*\`), has the unambiguous grammar: :A ‚Üí aA  Œµ ‚Ä¶but also has the ambiguous grammar: :A ‚Üí aA  Aa  Œµ These correspond to producing a right-associative tree (for the unambiguous grammar) or allowing both left- and right- association. This is elaborated below. Addition and subtraction The context free grammar :A ‚Üí A + A  A ‚àí A  a is ambiguous since there are two leftmost derivations for the string a + a + a: { border=\\"0\\"   A  ‚Üí A + A   A  ‚Üí A + A   ‚Üí a + A   ‚Üí A + A + A (First A is replaced by A+A. Replacement of the second A would yield a similar derivation)   ‚Üí a + A + A   ‚Üí a + A + A   ‚Üí a + a + A   ‚Üí a + a + A   ‚Üí a + a + a   ‚Üí a + a + a } As another example, the grammar is ambiguous since there are two parse trees for the string a + a ‚àí a: :400px The language that it generates, however, is not inherently ambiguous; the following is a non- ambiguous grammar generating the same language: :A ‚Üí A + a  A ‚àí a  a Dangling else A common example of ambiguity in computer programming languages is the dangling else problem. In many languages, the \`else\` in an If‚Äìthen(‚Äìelse) statement is optional, which results in nested conditionals having multiple ways of being recognized in terms of the context-free grammar. Concretely, in many languages one may write conditionals in two valid forms: the if-then form, and the if-then-else form ‚Äì in effect, making the else clause optional:The following example uses Pascal syntax In a grammar containing the rules Statement ‚Üí if Condition then Statement  if Condition then Statement else Statement  ... Condition ‚Üí ... some ambiguous phrase structures can appear. The expression if a then if b then s else s2 can be parsed as either if a then begin if b then s end else s2 or as if a then begin if b then s else s2 end depending on whether the \`else\` is associated with the first \`if\` or second \`if\`. This is resolved in various ways in different languages. Sometimes the grammar is modified so that it is unambiguous, such as by requiring an \`endif\` statement or making \`else\` mandatory. In other cases the grammar is left ambiguous, but the ambiguity is resolved by making the overall phrase grammar context-sensitive, such as by associating an \`else\` with the nearest \`if\`. In this latter case the grammar is unambiguous, but the context-free grammar is ambiguous. An unambiguous grammar with multiple derivations The existence of multiple derivations of the same string does not suffice to indicate that the grammar is ambiguous; only multiple leftmost derivations (or, equivalently, multiple parse trees) indicate ambiguity. For example, the simple grammar S ‚Üí A + A A ‚Üí 0  1 is an unambiguous grammar for the language { 0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1 }. While each of these four strings has only one leftmost derivation, it has two different derivations, for example S ‚áí A + A ‚áí 0 + A ‚áí 0 + 0 and S ‚áí A + A ‚áí A + 0 ‚áí 0 + 0 Only the former derivation is a leftmost one. Recognizing ambiguous grammars The decision problem of whether an arbitrary grammar is ambiguous is undecidable because it can be shown that it is equivalent to the Post correspondence problem. At least, there are tools implementing some semi-decision procedure for detecting ambiguity of context-free grammars. The efficiency of context-free grammar parsing is determined by the automaton that accepts it. Deterministic context- free grammars are accepted by deterministic pushdown automata and can be parsed in linear time, for example by the LR parser. This is a subset of the context-free grammars which are accepted by the pushdown automaton and can be parsed in polynomial time, for example by the CYK algorithm. Unambiguous context-free grammars can be nondeterministic. For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the unambiguous context-free grammar S ‚Üí 0S0  1S1  Œµ. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string. Nevertheless, removing grammar ambiguity may produce a deterministic context-free grammar and thus allow for more efficient parsing. Compiler generators such as YACC include features for resolving some kinds of ambiguity, such as by using the precedence and associativity constraints. Inherently ambiguous languages The existence of inherently ambiguous languages was proven with Parikh's theorem in 1961 by Rohit Parikh in an MIT research report. While some context- free languages (the set of strings that can be generated by a grammar) have both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, there exist context-free languages for which no unambiguous context-free grammar can exist. An example of an inherently ambiguous language is the union of {a^n b^m c^m d^n  n, m > 0} with {a^n b^n c^m d^m  n, m > 0}. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But give a proof that there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) common subset {a^n b^n c^n d^n  n > 0}.p.99-103, Sect.4.7 See also *GLR parser, a type of parser for ambiguous and nondeterministic grammars *Chart parser, another type of parser for ambiguous grammars *Syntactic ambiguity References  Notes External links *dk.brics.grammar - a grammar ambiguity analyzer. *CFGAnalyzer - tool for analyzing context-free grammars with respect to language universality, ambiguity, and similar properties.

Stone, philanthropist Irving Stone (born Tennenbaum, July 14, 1903, San Francisco ‚Äì August 26, 1989, Los Angeles) was an American writer, chiefly known for his biographical novels of noted artists, politicians and intellectuals. Among the best known are Lust for Life (1934), about the life of Vincent van Gogh, and The Agony and the Ecstasy (1961), about Michelangelo. Biography Born Irving Tennenbaum, he was seven when his parents divorced. By the time he was a senior in high school, his mother had remarried. He legally changed his last name to \\"Stone\\", his stepfather's surname. Stone said his mother instilled a passion for reading in him. From then on, he believed that education was the only way to succeed in life. In 1923, Stone received his bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley. After receiving his M.A. there, he worked as a teaching assistant in English. He met his first wife, Lona Mosk (1905‚Äì1965), who was a student at the university. On money provided by her father, Los Angeles businessman Ernest Mosk, the young couple went to Paris. Irving and Lona Stone returned to the United States in the 1930s from Europe, where he had been researching Van Gogh for six months. In 1930 he received a letter from Dr. Felix Rey - who had treated Vincent after he'd cut off his own ear in December 1888. Rey later became Stone's friend and was the subject of a portrait painting by Van Gogh. Rey confirmed Van Gogh;s whole ear was removed and not only Van Gogh's earlobe. As reported in the NY Times obituary of Stone on August 28, 1989 the Stones resided in New York's Greenwich Village where Irving finished Lust for Life, the biographical novel about Van Gogh that set his career in motion. According to the Times, Lust for Life (the title suggested by his first wife) was rejected by seventeen publishers over three years before being published in 1934. Stone took up with his secretary Jean. After he was divorced from Lona, he and Jean married. This later marriage lasted until Stone's death in 1989. Jean Stone died in 2004 aged 93. During their years together, Jean Stone edited many of his works. The Stones lived primarily in Los Angeles. They funded a foundation to support charitable causes they believed in. When at home, Stone relied upon the research facilities and expertise made available to him by Esther Euler, head research librarian of the University of California at Los Angeles. He dedicated books to her and thanked her in several of his works. According to his afterword for Lust for Life, Stone relied on Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo. Stone additionally did much of his research \\"in the field\\". For example, he spent many years living in Italy while working on The Agony and the Ecstasy, a novel about Michelangelo. The Italian government lauded Stone with several honorary awards during this period for his cultural achievements highlighting Italian history. Non-fiction books Although he was best known for his novels, Stone also wrote a number of non-fiction books. His biography of Clarence Darrow, Clarence Darrow For the Defense, about the attorney known both for his defense of thrill killers Leopold and Loeb and his defense of John T. Scopes in the 1925 Scopes \\"Monkey\\" Trial (the trial of a biology teacher who taught about evolution in Tennessee)‚Äî, was published in 1941. His biography Earl Warren, about the California governor and later Chief Justice of the United States, was published in 1948. Film adaptations In 1953, a popular film version was made of The President's Lady, based on Stone's 1951 novel of the same name, starring Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson and Susan Hayward as Rachel Donelson Jackson. In 1956, a film version was made of Lust for Life, based on his 1934 novel, starring Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh.

Any such surface is the Kummer variety of the Jacobian variety of a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus 2; i.e. a quotient of the Jacobian by the Kummer involution x ‚Ü¶ ‚àíx. The Kummer involution has 16 fixed points: the 16 2-torsion point of the Jacobian, and they are the 16 singular points of the quartic surface. Resolving the 16 double points of the quotient of a (possibly nonalgebraic) torus by the Kummer involution gives a K3 surface with 16 disjoint rational curves; these K3 surfaces are also sometimes called Kummer surfaces. Other surfaces closely related to Kummer surfaces include Weddle surfaces, wave surfaces, and tetrahedroids.  Geometry of the Kummer surface   Singular quartic surfaces and the double plane model  Let K\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{P}^3 be a quartic surface with an ordinary double point p, near which K looks like a quadratic cone. Any projective line through p then meets K with multiplicity two at p, and will therefore meet the quartic K in just two other points. Identifying the lines in \\\\mathbb{P}^3 through the point p with \\\\mathbb{P}^2, we get a double cover from the blow up of K at p to \\\\mathbb{P}^2; this double cover is given by sending q ‚â† p ‚Ü¶ \\\\scriptstyle\\\\overline{pq}, and any line in the tangent cone of p in K to itself. The ramification locus of the double cover is a plane curve C of degree 6, and all the nodes of K which are not p map to nodes of C. By the genus degree formula, the maximal number possible number of nodes on a sextic curve is obtained when the curve is a union of 6 lines, in which case we have 15 nodes. Hence the maximal number of nodes on a quartic is 16, and in this case they are all simple nodes (to show that p is simple project from another node). A quartic which obtains these 16 nodes is called a Kummer Quartic, and we will concentrate on them below. Since p is a simple node, the tangent cone to this point is mapped to a conic under the double cover. This conic is in fact tangent to the six lines (w.o proof). Conversely, given a configuration of a conic and six lines which tangent to it in the plane, we may define the double cover of the plane ramified over the union of these 6 lines. This double cover may be mapped to \\\\mathbb{P}^3, under a map which blows down the double cover of the special conic, and is an isomorphism elsewhere (w.o. proof).  The double plane and Kummer varieties of Jacobians  Starting from a smooth curve C of genus 2, we may identify the Jacobian Jac(C) with Pic^2(C) under the map x\\\\mapsto x+K_C. We now observe two facts: Since C is a hyperelliptic curve the map from the symmetric product Sym^2 C to Pic^2 C, defined by {p,q}\\\\mapsto p+q, is the blow down of the graph of the hyperelliptic involution to the canonical divisor class. Moreover, the canonical map C\\\\toK_C^* is a double cover. Hence we get a double cover Kum(C)\\\\to Sym^2K_C^*. This double cover is the one which already appeared above: The 6 lines are the images of the odd symmetric theta divisors on Jac(C), while the conic is the image of the blown-up 0. The conic is isomorphic to the canonical system via the isomorphism T_0 Jac(C)\\\\cong K_C^*, and each of the six lines is naturally isomorphic to the dual canonical system K_C^* via the identification of theta divisors and translates of the curve C. There is a 1-1 correspondence between pairs of odd symmetric theta divisors and 2-torsion points on the Jacobian given by the fact that (\\\\Theta+w_1)\\\\cap(\\\\Theta+w_2)={w_1-w_2,0}, where w_1,w_2 are Weierstrass points (which are the odd theta characteristics in this in genus 2). Hence the branch points of the canonical map C\\\\mapsto K_C^* appear on each of these copies of the canonical system as the intersection points of the lines and the tangency points of the lines and the conic. Finally, since we know that every Kummer quartic is a Kummer variety of a Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we show how to reconstruct Kummer quartic surface directly from the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve: The Jacobian of C maps to the complete linear system O_{Jac(C)}(2\\\\Theta_C)\\\\cong\\\\mathbb{P}^{2^2-1} (see the article on Abelian varieties). This map factors through the Kummer variety as a degree 4 map which has 16 nodes at the images of the 2-torsion points on Jac(C).  The quadric line complex   Level 2 structure   Kummer's 16_6 configuration  There are several crucial points which relate the geometric, algebraic, and combinatorial aspects of the configuration of the nodes of the kummer quartic: * Any symmetric odd theta divisor on Jac(C) is given by the set points {q-wq\\\\in C}, where w is a Weierstrass point on C. This theta divisor contains six 2-torsion points: w'-w such that w' is a Weierstrass point. * Two odd theta divisors given by Weierstrass points w,w' intersect at 0 and at w-w'. * The translation of the Jacobian by a two torsion point is an isomorphism of the Jacobian as an algebraic surface, which maps the set of 2-torsion points to itself. * In the complete linear system 2\\\\Theta_C on Jac(C), any odd theta divisor is mapped to a conic, which is the intersection of the Kummer quartic with a plane. Moreover, this complete linear system is invariant under shifts by 2-torsion points. Hence we have a configuration of 16 conics in \\\\mathbb{P}^3; where each contains 6 nodes, and such that the intersection of each two is along 2 nodes. This configuration is called the 16_6 configuration or the Kummer configuration.  The Weil Pairing  The 2-torsion points on an Abelian variety admit a symplectic bilinear form called the Weil pairing. In the case of Jacobians of curves of genus two, every nontrivial 2-torsion point is uniquely expressed as a difference between two of the six Weierstrass points of the curve. The Weil pairing is given in this case by \\\\langle p_1-p_2,p_3-p_4\\\\rangle=#{p_1,p_2}\\\\cap{p_3,p_4}. One can recover a lot of the group theoretic invariants of the group Sp_4(2) via the geometry of the 16_6 configuration.

The CAJ was created to promote excellence in the craft of journalism and to encourage investigative journalism in Canada. The CAJ presents annual investigative journalism awards including the McGillivray Award and the Charles Bury Award. History The CAJ was founded in 1978 as the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ). A few senior Canadian journalists founded the CIJ to counteract the isolation of the one or two reporters in the average newsroom who did investigative work. One of CIJ's initiatives was the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom group that later became Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE). In 1990, the organization changed its name to its current form to reflect a broader emphasis on all journalism and attract additional members. Promoting investigate journalism remains one of the CAJ's main goals. Awards The Canadian Association of Journalists runs an annual awards program recognizing the best in Canadian journalism, with a particular focus on journalism that is investigative in nature. Entries are welcome from any practising journalist whose work has been published or broadcast in Canada. A call for entries is usually issued in December‚ÄìJanuary, with a deadline in late January or early February. Once judging is complete, a list of the finalists in each category is released. The winning entry in each category is announced as part of the banquet during the annual conference each spring. INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM These categories recognize journalism in a variety of media as set out below. Entries don't have to be purely investigative to qualify; investigative entries are given added weight. Direction to judges include such items as effective use of the medium the entry was published or broadcast in, thoroughness of research, relevance and any outcomes arising from the entry's publication or broadcast. Items based on the same body of research, regardless of which medium they were released in, can only be entered in one category. Entries are awarded in the categories below, with the winner of the Don McGillivray Award for Investigative Journalism chosen from amongst these categories. Open newspaper / wire service Entries welcomed for any article published in a Canadian newspaper or wire service, regardless of circulation or publication frequency. Print articles published exclusively on newspaper websites are also eligible. Community newspaper Entries welcomed for any article published in a Canadian newspaper with an average circulation of under 25,000 or any newspaper published fewer than five times a week. Print articles published exclusively on newspaper websites are also eligible. Magazine Entries welcomed for any article published by a Canadian magazine. Print articles published exclusively on magazine websites are also eligible. ''' Open television (under five minutes runtime)''' Entries welcomed for any piece broadcast on any Canadian station, with a runtime of under five minutes. Open television (over five minutes runtime) Entries welcomed for any piece broadcast on any Canadian station, with a runtime of over five minutes. Regional television Entries welcomed for any piece broadcast exclusively on a local or regional station. Open radio news or current affairs Entries welcome for any news or current affairs audio broadcast on any Canadian station, of any length. CAJ / Marketwired data journalism Entries welcome from any media in any format published or broadcast in Canada where data journalism / CAR techniques played a key and indispensable part in developing the story. This category is meant to highlight the use of data journalism, but not at the expense of good journalism and good storytelling. GENERAL AWARDS The following categories recognize exemplary journalism as laid out below. The winning entries in each of these categories is not eligible for consideration for the Don McGillivray award. Photojournalism Entries welcome showcasing a portfolio of up to 20 photographs demonstrating journalistic vision, consistent quality and a reflection of the entrant's professionalism and journalistic abilities. Scoop Entries welcome from any media in any format published or broadcast in Canada that can show how it was the first to bring new or significant information to light of regional or national importance. Daily excellence Entries welcome from print, radio and television journalists for items published or broadcast in Canada demonstrating excellence in daily, deadline- driven reporting based on same-day research. Print feature Entries welcome for any article published in a Canadian newspaper or magazine that is not specifically investigative in nature. jhr / CAJ Award for Human Rights Reporting What is human rights reporting? This prize rewards journalism that puts a human face on situations where human rights are not respected and/or holds authorities to account to do a better job of protecting those rights. As a result, the story builds awareness of human rights and social justice issues, and shows the human impact and the human cost of abstract political and economic forces. To qualify, a story must also be international in scope. For examples of human rights reporting, visit www.jhr.ca/success/ The details: The winner receives the opportunity to travel with jhr to one of its African project sites over 14 days. Travel (flights) to the site is provided by jhr, as is on-the-ground travel in the host nation. The CAJ provides the winner a $500 cash prize. The winner agrees to be responsible for covering pre- departure costs (visas, vaccinations, etc.) as well as accommodation costs while in Africa, which are booked in liaison with jhr (est. $1,000+). The winning entrant will be have her/his registration fee to the 2013 CAJ conference waived and be invited to give a presentation sharing the award's experience with CAJ conference delegates. CWA Canada / CAJ Award for Labour Reporting What are labour issues? Judges will be instructed to reward those entries that effectively bring to the public's attention important labour issues. The award seeks to honour journalism that goes beyond a work-to-rule, strike, lockout or other job action and shows skill in reporting on the social, economic and political factors that impact the labour environment in Canada. Entries showing impact on policy, law or public awareness are encouraged. This award is meant to recognize great journalism on labour issues that can make a difference in the lives of Canadians. Does an entry have to be reporting on a union? No‚Äì judges are looking for the best journalism on labour issues. While Canada's unions are integral to the labour movement, not all of the labour issues that are reported on in this country involve unions. It's expected many entries will include the labour movement and unions, but this is not a requirement of the award. Entries are encouraged in either official language. Should the judges determine it appropriate, one award may be handed out for reporting done in English and another in French. CAJ / CNW GROUP STUDENT AWARD OF EXCELLENCE The award recognizes excellence in the field of journalism at the student level. Submissions will be accepted from all students enrolled (at the time of publication or broadcast) in an accredited degree/diploma program offered by a Canadian university or college. In addition to awards for professional excellence, the CAJ presents a Code of Silence Award to celebrate \\"Canada's rich bureaucratic culture of secrecy.\\" At the 'Muck Rake 2004' conference in Vancouver in May, 2004, the federal government Health Canada department won its third Code of Silence award. Winners since then include the federal department of foreign affairs in 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office in 2009 and the Toronto Police Service in 2010. Governance The CAJ is governed by a board of directors, elected by chapters or through regional or national elections held prior to the annual meeting. Members of the board must be practising journalists as defined by the CAJ bylaws. Karyn Pugliese is president of the Canadian Association of Journalists (2018-2020) and previously sat on the CAJ Ethics Committee.

A wooden mallet Stonemason's mallets of plastic, wood and steel An iron mallet with copper faces. Solid head copper mallets are produced with a round or square head An aluminum meat mallet, for tenderizing meat Meat mallet. Cooking mallet for crushing crops. Indian cobbler tool kit, with an iron mallet A mallet is a kind of hammer, often made of rubber or sometimes wood, that is smaller than a maul or beetle, and usually has a relatively large head. The term is descriptive of the overall size and proportions of the tool, and not the materials it may be made of, though most mallets have striking faces that are softer than steel. Mallets are used in various industries, such as upholstery work, and a variety of other general purposes. It is a tool of preference for wood workers using chisels with plastic, metal, or wooden handles, as they give a softened strike with a positive drive. * Wooden mallets are usually used in carpentry to knock wooden pieces together, or to drive dowels or chisels. A wooden mallet will not deform the striking end of a metal tool, as most metal hammers would. It is also used to reduce the force driving the cutting edge of a chisel, giving better control. Hardwood mallets are also used to knock in cricket bats. * Copper, brass and leaden mallets are typically used on machinery to apply force to parts with a reduced risk of damaging them, and to avoid sparks. As these metals are softer than steel, the mallet is deformed by any excessive force, rather than any steel object it is hitting. * Meat mallets tenderise or flatten meat. Made from wood or metal, they are typically two-sided, one flat or with slight bumps, and the other with more pronounced protrusions. Their use has been reduced with the invention of cube steak machines and other electric tenderisers, but they can still be readily found at cookery stores and in professional use. Less common mallets include: * Rawhide mallets, which may employ rawhide covering a steel head, or simply consist of rolled-up rawhide, are used for leatherwork, jewellery, and assembling electric motors and delicate machinery. * Plastic mallets, made of nylon, polycarbonate, or polystyrene are used especially in leatherwork and jewellery. * Split head mallets have removable faces which can be changed to an appropriate material for the job. * Beetle mallets are large mallets with a circular wood or plastic head, with rounded ends about in diameter, and a handle about long. It is used by paviours for tapping paving stones into position when bedding them. Beetles are also used in jobs such as timber framing to shift the bases of large wooden posts, to fit joints, and to drive in pegs.An illustration of the mallet can be found in Charles F. Mitchell's Building Construction, 11th edition, printed in 1930 by B.T. Batford, Ltd. * Dead blow mallets typically have an internal cavity partially filled with steel shot, lead shot, or loose sand. This modification evens out the time-impulse curve of the impact, enabling a more powerful blow to be delivered without risk of marring the target. * Carver's mallets feature heads where the axis of rotation is in line with the handle (so the hitting surface is always round) in a shape like a cylinder on its end, or a conical frustum, or half of a capsule (see images of \\"stonemason's mallets\\" to the right). The round striking surface is designed to drive a chisel or wedge and allows for a face to strike when swinging from any angle. Mallets of various types are some of the oldest forms of tools, and have been found in Stone Age gravesites. Musical instruments Mallets used as drumsticks are often used to strike a marimba, xylophone, glockenspiel, metallophone, or vibraphone, collectively referred to as mallet percussion. The sticks usually have shafts made of rattan, birch, or fiberglass. Rattan shafts are more flexible than the other materials. Heads vary in size, shape, and material; they may be made of metal, plastic, rubber, or wood, and some are wrapped with felt, cord, or yarn. Heavier heads produce louder sounds, while harder heads produce sharper and louder sounds, with more overtones. Toys Mallets are commonly used as children's toys. Lightweight wooden mallets are used for peg toys. Toy mallets are also used in games such as Whac-A-Mole. Another type of toy mallet is a plastic mallet made of soft, hollow vinyl, with bellows and a built-in whistle, so that when the mallet is struck, it produces a sharp, chirping sound. A yellow-handled, red-headed squeaky plastic mallet known as the \\"Chipote Chill√≥n\\" (Squeaky Bruiser), or the \\"Marreta Bi√¥nica\\" (Bionic Sledgehammer) in Portuguese, was the iconic weapon of Mexican comedian Chespirito's comical superhero character El Chapul√≠n Colorado. Cartoons The misuse of wooden mallets in the workplace became a classic gag in the Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, Nickelodeon, Disney, and MGM cartoons, including some more recent 3D animations. Characters like Roger Rabbit, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Tom and Jerry and Screwy Squirrel made use of mallets as part of their arsenal in the Golden Age of animation. On the British daytime shows TV-AM and GMTV, and in the spinoff children's shows hosted by Timmy Mallet, a game was played called \\"Mallet's Mallet\\" where a participant had to associate words in a certain time period. Failing contestants were hit on the head by Mallet, using a soft pink and yellow mallet with black \\"Mallet's Mallet\\" writing on both sides. The person who got hit then had a sticking plaster affixed to their head by Mallet. In slapstick anime and manga, it is a common gag for an angry character to pull a large mallet out of thin air, and strike the person or thing that is angering him/her.

It was visually distinctive because of its salmon‚Äëcolored pages and sketch illustrations. Henry Rollins once described it as \\"the curiously pink newspaper\\". The paper switched to white‚Äëcolored paper in 2014. The fourth and longest-serving editor for the newspaper, Peter Kaplan, left the newspaper on July 1, 2009. Interim editor Tom McGeveran was replaced by Kyle Pope in 2009. Elizabeth Spiers served as editor from 2011 to 2012, followed by interim editor Aaron Gell. In January 2013, publisher Jared Kushner named his longtime friend Ken Kurson, a political consultant, journalist, and author, as the Observers next editor. Publication of the weekly print edition ended with the November 9, 2016. issue.The Wall Street Journal, Monday, November 14, 2016, pg. B5 Observer Media, the publication's parent company, has continued to publish content on an online site under the masthead \\"Observer\\" (dropping \\"New York\\" from the name). The discontinuation of the print Observer came the day after Kushner's father-in-law, Donald Trump (Trump's daughter Ivanka is Kushner's wife), won the 2016 presidential election; Kushner serves as a senior adviser in the Trump Administration. Kushner transferred his ownership of Observer Media's remaining online assets into a family trust, through which his brother-in-law Joseph Meyer took over his former role as publisher. James Karklins, the former global chief marketing officer at Newsweek Media Group, was announced as the new president of Observer on January 8, 2018. His role will be to help Observer grow, by diversifying its revenue streams, putting together conferences, and even charging for digital subscriptions. Ownership The publisher and original owner, Arthur Carter, has had other publishing interests, including the Litchfield County Times. At one time, he was a part‚Äëowner in The East Hampton Star. Carter received a B.A. in French literature from Brown University and an M.B.A. in finance from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. He spent 25 years in investment banking until 1981, when he founded the Litchfield County Times in New Milford, Connecticut. He owned it for twenty years until selling to Journal Register Company, later also selling his 50‚Äëpercent interest in The East Hampton Star in 2003. He has been an adjunct professor of philosophy and journalism at New York University and is a trustee. In July 2006, Jared Kushner, a 25‚Äëyear‚Äëold law student and son of a wealthy New Jersey developer, Charles Kushner, purchased the paper for just under $10million. In April 2007 Bob Sommer became president of Observer Media Group, and subsequently served on the Observer Media Group Board of Directors. In January 2017, Jared Kushner announced he would sell his stake to a Kushner family trust, when he became a senior advisor to President Donald Trump. Kushner's brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer, who has been the CEO of Observer Media Group since 2013, replaced him as publisher. Political stance In 2016, the New York Observer became notable for being one of only a handful of newspapers to officially endorse United States presidential candidate Donald Trump in the Republican Party presidential primaries. The newspaper's owner and then publisher, Jared Kushner, is Donald Trump's son-in-law and was an advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. The Observer did not repeat its endorsement after Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for President.

It was often used as a derogatory slur by Italian American and Sicilian American mobsters in reference to newer immigrant Sicilian and Italian mafiosi. The mobsters in the US were said to have difficulty understanding the Sicilian dialects of the new immigrants, in which words appeared to \\"zip\\" by. Other theories include pejorative uses, such as Sicilians' preference for homemade zip guns. According to still another theory, the term is a contraction of the Sicilian slang term for \\"hicks\\" or \\"primitives.\\" The older Sicilian mafiosi of the pre-Prohibition era, known as \\"Mustache Petes,\\" were also referred to as \\"zips\\". They were deposed by American-born mobsters during the Castellammarese War. Arrival in the United States With increasing violence and government presence in Italy, Sicilians and Neapolitans alike found positions in the growing drug trafficking market of New York City's Five Families in the early 20th century. The Pizza Connection, a heroin-trafficking operation involving Salvatore Catalano, a capo of the Bonanno crime family, and Gaetano Badalamenti, a Sicilian mafioso, was largely organized by Zips. The Zips were effective because they were unknown in the United States and had no police records. They generally congregated in the Knickerbocker Avenue area. The younger Sicilian mafiosi became known for their reckless and undisciplined behavior, which gained unwanted attention for New York's crime families. The Zips had no qualms about murdering people who had been considered off-limits by the American Mafia, such as police officers, judges, and women and children. They were also known for using bombs to kill their targets. Although bombings were commonly used by the Sicilian Mafia, American mafiosi have usually shied away from bombs out of concern that they could put innocent people at risk.Capeci, Mustain (1996), pp. 139‚Äì140 Zips were also known to have killed victims who were terminally ill. In the Sicilian Mafia, when someone is marked for death, that person cannot be allowed to die of natural causes. The group was tolerated because they earned millions for the families, specifically the Bonanno and Gambino families. Both Carmine Galante and Carlo Gambino used zips for running narcotics and conducting murders. Galante's two personal bodyguards Cesare Bonventre and Baldo Amato, were Zips. Many Italian-American mobsters distrusted the Zips. Bonanno soldier Benjamin \\"Lefty\\" Ruggiero explained in a conversation to undercover FBI agent Joseph \\"Donnie Brasco\\" Pistone: > \\"Lots of people hate him [Galante]... There's only a few people he's close > to. And that's mainly the Zips... Those guys are always with him. He brought > them over from Sicily, and he uses them for different pieces of work and for > dealing all that junk [drugs]. They're as mean as he is. You can't trust > those bastard Zips. Nobody can. Except the Old Man.\\" On another occasion, > Ruggiero told Pistone, \\"They hate the American people. They hate the > American wiseguys.\\" Bonanno soldier Anthony Mirra told Pistone, \\"The Zips > are clannish and secretive. They are the meanest killers in the business\\". Pizza connection With Galante's cooperation, as well as support from Sicilian mafiosi, the Zips' influence and power in New York's underworld grew. Eventually they arranged a working relationship between American and Sicilian mafiosi to begin large-scale drug trafficking operations to distribute heroin into the United States. Sicilian mafiosi purchased the morphine base in the Middle East, where it was processed into heroin, before being shipped to New York for distribution. Supplying support services and specific areas for distribution, New York's crime families collected a percentage of income from drug dealers, while keeping a distance from operations in order to avoid federal prosecution. By the late 1970s, Galante had been bringing in large numbers of Zips for the rapidly growing heroin distribution market (which had been peaking at $10 million a year). Galante's Zip bodyguards were party to his murder. Galante was murdered for keeping all the heroin trafficking profits for himself. In popular culture In the television series The Sopranos, Italian-born mobster Furio Giunta is referred to several times as a \\"Zip.\\" See also *Fresh off the boat References *Kelly, Robert J.

He was also a counter-insurgency theorist, mainly with his book Modern Warfare. Early life Roger Trinquier was born on 20 March 1908 in La Beaume, a small village in the Hautes-Alpes department, to a peasant family. He studied at a one-room village school in his home village until 1920, when he entered the Ecole Normale of Aix-en- Provence. He graduated in 1928 at twenty and was called up for 2 years' compulsory military service, being sent to the French Army's reserve officers‚Äô school, where unlike most of his classmates he became interested in the military. When Trinquier's two years of compulsory military service came to an end, he decided to remain in the army and was transferred to the active officers‚Äô school of Saint-Maixent, from which he graduated in 1933 as a second lieutenant. He now joined the colonial infantry. After some time with the 4th Senegalese Tirailleur Regiment at Toulon, he embarked on a ship bound for Indochina on 11 May 1934. He was first stationed at Kylua, near Lang Son, in Tonkin (Northern Vietnam). He then took command of a French outpost at Chi Ma on the Chinese border. Trinquier returned to France in 1936 and was assigned to the 41st Colonial Infantry Machine-gun Regiment (41e R√©giment de Mitrailleurs d‚ÄôInfanterie Coloniale, 41e RMIC) at Sarralbe, where he commanded a company until he was sent to China in early August 1938. He served in the French concessions in China, first in Tianjin, then Beijing and finally Shanghai in January 1940. While stationed there he also learned Chinese. Promoted to captain he commanded a company of the French military detachment there until 3 January 1946 under circumstance that had until 1945 become increasingly difficult during the Japanese invasion and occupation of large parts of China. Indochina He arrived at Saigon in early 1946 and was assigned to Commando Ponchardier, a combined army and navy commando unit named after its commander Captain Pierre Ponchardier. Trinquier became commander of B4, one of the sub-units of the commando, recruited from the colonial infantry. He returned to France in the summer of 1946, charged with the responsibility of recruiting and training volunteers for a colonial parachute battalion that was being formed for combat in Indochina against the Viet Minh. Trinquier returned to Indochina with the 2nd Colonial Commando Parachute Battalion (2e BCCP), during November 1947. The battalion was assigned to Lai Thieu, a refuge for the 301st Viet Minh Regiment, located around 20 km from Saigon. He took part, as second-in-command, in operations in Cambodia and on the Plain of Reeds in southern Vietnam. He took command of the battalion when its commander, Major Dupuis, was killed in action on 9 September 1948, and was promoted to Major on 1 October. Leading the battalion in combat in central Annam and the area around Saigon, he became aware of the inefficiency of the operations launched by the French high command and proposed to General Pierre Boyer de Latour du Moulin, the commander of the French forces in southern Vietnam, a new approach to pacifying areas with strong Viet Minh presence. Trinquier's troops occupied the terrain and laid ambushes against the Viet Minh at night instead of the normal policy of taking a few positions, where refuge could be taken at night and then reopening the roads in the morning. Trinquier's tactics proved effective, reassured people and pacified the La√Ø Thieu area. On 12 December 1949, after thirty airborne operations and numerous ground operations, Trinquier and the battalion embarked on Pasteur, a French transport ship, and returned to France. In late December 1951, Trinquier was again in Indochina for his third tour ‚Äì this time in the newly formed Groupement de Commandos Mixtes A√©roport√©s (GCMA) (Composite Airborne Commando Group) commanded by Edmond Grall. Trinquier took over the command of the GCMA in early 1953 and directed the fighting behind Viet Minh lines, creating a maquis in the Tonkinese upper region and in Laos, totaling around 30,000 men. Trinquier's maquis contributed to the successful evacuation of the fortified airhead at Na San, in August 1953, and the reoccupation of the Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces. After the French withdrawal following the defeat of Dien Bien Phu, Trinquier's maquis was left behind and hunted down by Ho Chi Minh's forces. Algeria Trinquier returned to France in January 1955, being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and assigned to the staff of General Gilles, commander of the airborne troops. He was posted to Algeria in August 1956 at the airborne base of French North Africa as the war against the FLN was becoming more intense. He then served as second-in-command to General Massu, commander of the 10th Parachute Division, during the Battle of Algiers, where he was one of the leading figures behind the creation of the DPU (Dispositif de Protection Urbain). After a brief stay in France as a director to the airborne school, Trinquier returned to Algeria in March 1958 to take over command of the 3rd Colonial Parachute Regiment, soon to be the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, when its commanding officer, Marcel Bigeard, was recalled to France. He became a member of the committee for public safety formed by Generals Massu and Salan during the May 1958 crisis, which brought Charles de Gaulle back to power; Trinquier resigned from the committee on 11 June and returned to his regiment. He led it during the fighting in southern Algeria and in the Kabylie, where he captured Si Azzedine, a senior FLN leader. During the first half of 1959, Trinquier led the regiment during the Challe Offensive, proposed by the French commander in Algeria, Maurice Challe, to cripple the FLN. In March 1959, he handed over the command of the regiment to Louis Bonnigal and in July, took command of the El Milia sector in Constantine department. He was recalled to France in July 1960 and in December assigned to Nice and the staff of the general commanding that group of sub- divisions. Later life On 26 January 1961, Trinquier asked for early retirement from the army into the reserve. He was then hired by Moise Tshombe, the leader of the State of Katanga rebellion in Congo, to train his forces. Trinquier only stayed a few weeks in Congo before being thrown out by the United Nations. Returning from Congo, when staying in Athens, he learned of the failed Algiers putsch against de Gaulle, after which he asked to be retired from the reserve as well. In retirement he devoted himself to viniculture and writing about his career and experiences. With Colonel Buchoud, he was one of the founders of the National Union of Paratroopers (Union Nationale des Parachutistes, UNP), for veterans of the French airborne force. Trinquier was also its first president from 1963 to 1965, before stepping down for General Jean Gracieux.Pr√©sentation g√©n√©rale de l'UNP . Retrieved on 16 November 2008. Modern Warfare Trinquier is a theorist on the style of warfare he called Modern Warfare, an \\"interlocking system of actions ‚Äì political, economic, psychological, military ‚Äì which aims at the overthrow of the established authority in a country and its replacement by another regime.\\" (Modern Warfare, Ch. 2). He was critical of the traditional army's inability to adapt to this new kind of warfare. These tactics included the use of small and mobile commando teams, torture, the setting-up of self- defense forces recruited in the local population, and their forced relocation in camps, as well as psychological and educational operations. Perhaps his most original contribution was his study and application of terrorism and torture as it related to this Modern Warfare. He argued that it was immoral to treat terrorists as criminals, and to hold them criminally liable for their acts. In his view terrorists should be treated as soldiers, albeit with the qualification that while they may attack civilian targets and wear no uniform, they also must be tortured for the very specific purpose of betraying their organization. Trinquier's criteria for torture was that the terrorist was to be asked only questions that related to the organization of his movement, that the interrogators must know what to ask, and that once the information is obtained the torture must stop and the terrorist is then treated as any other prisoner of war. (See Chapter 4 of Modern Warfare). The French Army applied Trinquier's tactics during the Algerian War. In the short run these tactics resulted in a decisive victory in the Battle of Algiers.Edward Behr The Algerian Problem, These tactics were exposed by the press, with little or no effect at the time, as they were generally regarded as a necessary evil. In the longer term the debate on the tactics used, particularly torture, would re-emerge in the French press for decades to come (with the trial of Paul Aussaresses). Popular culture The character of Julien Boisfeuras in the novels The Centurions and The Praetorians by Jean Larteguy was according to Larteguy not based on anyone, but believed by many to be at least partially inspired by Trinquier and Paul Aussaresses.. Retrieved on 11 February 2008. The character of Colonel Jean-Marie la Ronci√®re in another of Larteguy's novels, The Hounds of Hell (Les chim√®res noires), was certainly based on Trinquier and his activities during the Katanga rebellion.Jean Larteguy's books. Retrieved on 12 February 2008. Larteguy's fiction is rather critical of Trinquier's theories on subversive war which clearly could not be applied in the Congo. The colonel la Ronci√®re seems rather clumsy and unprepared for the situation he faces in Elisabethville where his total lack of knowledge of the post-colonial situation in Central Africa soon puts him in trouble with his European and African mentors. He is forced to flee the Katangese capital after helping Secessionists win the first round of fighting against UNO troops.

History Shirokiya (back right) in Edo (now Tokyo) circa 1850; drawn by Hiroshige. Note the logo on the front curtain Hikotaro Omura opened a dry goods store at Nihonbashi in Edo, (now Tokyo) in August 1662. Omura called the store Shirokiya Gofukuten, a name that would last until the 20th century. Over the next few hundred years, the store slowly expanded, and as Japan entered the Meiji era, Shirokiya and its main rival at the time, Mitsukoshi, expanded into selling clothing and other goods in 1886. In 1903, Shirokiya opened a western-style department store, followed by the creation of a larger store down the street eight years later. The turning point for Shirokiya was a series of natural, financial and man-made disasters that devastated the company's fortunes. The first was the Tokyo earthquake of 1923 that completely destroyed the original department store building (it was then reconstructed using modern architecture Old Tokyo: Shirokiya Department Store ). This was followed a few years later by a major fire on December 16, 1932, which destroyed the larger building and caused 14 fatalities. Finally, Shirokiya's assets, centered mainly in Tokyo, were devastated during World War II and the subsequent occupation of Japan, whereas Mitsukoshi, spread throughout the nation, fared better. By 1958, Shirokiya was clearly on the downturn; despite the use of innovative marketing techniques common in the west but unheard of in Japan, Mitsukoshi continued to have a commanding lead in Japan's retail industry. Tokyu era In 1958, in order to protect itself from a hostile takeover, Shirokiya agreed to be absorbed into the Tokyu Group, a railway company expanding into the retail industry at that time. In a move to unite all Japanese stores under the Tokyu Department Store chain, the Shirokiya brand progressively disappeared from Japanese life, culminating with the renaming of the Nihonbashi site in 1967.Tokyu Department Store Co., Ltd. Company history However, the fusion with Tokyu also resulted in an overseas expansion using the Shirokiya branding. On October 29, 1959, the first branch of Shirokiya outside Japan opened in Hawaii's then brand-new Ala Moana Center. The branch would later move to its present location in Ala Moana, across from Liberty House (now Macy's) in 1966. A branch store was opened in Maui in November 1973. A second branch was opened up at Pearlridge, near Pearl Harbor, on April 2, 1981. Though the three stores were popular with both local residents and tourists, the stores had an uneven profit record. By the 1990s, as the Japanese economy collapsed, the Tokyu Group went heavily into debt. By 2001 the company was already $470 million in debt, and in 1999 it was forced to close its 330-year-old flagship location in Nihonbashi.Êù±ÊÄ•ÁôæË≤®Â∫ó„ÅÆÊ≤øÈù© (japanese) 1999 Âπ≥Êàê11Âπ¥1Êúà Êó•Êú¨Ê©ãÂ∫óÈñâÂ∫ó [January 1999 Closure of the Nihonbashi shop]Êù±ÊÄ•ÁôæË≤®Â∫óÊó•Êú¨Ê©ãÂ∫ó(ÂÖÉÁôΩÊú®Â±ãÔºâ„ÅåÈñâÂ∫ó„Åó„ÅüÊó•(japanese) translation In order to further cut costs, Tokyu began to shed its overseas businesses, either selling them off or closing them outright. Eventually, attention turned to the Shirokiya stores, with the Pearlridge store closing in March 2001 and the Maui store shuttering in May of that same year. Customer outcry was immense. Led by Senator Daniel Inouye, a petition signed by 30,000 residents of Hawaii and Japan was sent to Tokyu, in the hopes that Tokyu would find a fitting end to the \\"Shirokiya crisis\\". News reports both in Japan and Hawaii began to report that Tokyu would simply close all of its retail outlets and sell off its other properties and focus only on its Japanese businesses. This was compounded when Tokyu declined to renegotiate its leases for all the stores. Modern era In a surprise move, Tokyu opted to sell the Shirokiya company to the seven highest-ranking executives of the Hawaiian store for the amount of $1, taking a $23 million loss. The deal, which included the rights to build a future expansion at Tokyu's lone remaining Hawaii asset, the Shirokiya Department Store at Ala Moana Shopping Center, ensured the survival of Shirokiya, though there were some reports in the Japanese media about the loss of one of Japan's oldest companies to the U.S. The newly formed Shirokiya Holdings acted immediately, streamlining operations and assets, and renegotiating the lease on the remaining store. On November 17, 2002, Shirokiya reopened its doors, with then-Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano declaring the day to be \\"Shirokiya Day\\". The following year, on July 14, 2003, Shirokiya Holdings reported net sales of $35 million. On June 25, 2016, Shirokiya opened the new Shirokiya Japan Village Walk, offering customers a unique experience showcasing a traditional Japanese town reminiscent of old Kyoto. Highlighting traditional Japanese culture, the new Shirokiya Japan Village Walk consists of four main themes: Yataimura (quality food court & beer garden featuring $1 beers), Zeppin Plaza (shopping alleys), Omatsuri Hiroba (festival and event square) and Guardian Spirits Sanctuary (good luck deities). The former Shirokiya space above the Vintage Cave Club was converted into another Ala Moana Center food court called \\"The Lanai.\\" External links *Shirokiya official website *Old Tokyo: Shirokiya Department Store *Shirokiya called more than a store, Honolulu Advertiser, January 23, 2000 *Shirokiya bids aloha to Pearlridge store, Honolulu Star-Bulletin, February 6, 2001 *Saving Shirokiya, Honolulu Star-Bulletin, July 14, 2002 *Tokyu Department Store Co., Ltd.

A year later he was named president of the Travel Related Services group, which was responsible for American Express cards, traveler's cheques, and travel-service offices. At this time, MasterCard and Visa had begun to compete for the company's market share. Gerstner found new uses and users for the card. In 1980, most department stores did not accept American Express cards ‚Äî by 1985 retail sales were second only to airline tickets in card purchases. College students, physicians, and women were singled out in various marketing pushes. Corporations were persuaded to adopt the card as a more effective way of tracking business expenses. Gerstner also created exclusive versions appealing to higher-end clients, such as the Gold Card, which carried an annual fee of $65 and came with a $2,000 line of credit, and the Platinum Card, which had a $250 annual fee, a $10,000 check-cashing benefit, and private club memberships for traveling executives. As sales and profits rebounded, Gerstner was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer of AmEx's Travel Related Services in 1982, and president of the parent company in 1985. Although he claimed the position at the age of 43, Gerstner dismissed the speculation that his success was the product of being a workaholic. Gerstner told Leslie Wayne, \\"I hear that and I can't accept that. A workaholic can't take vacations and I take four weeks a year.\\" As chairman and chief executive officer of the Travel Related Services division, Gerstner spearheaded its successful \\"membership has its privileges\\" promotion. Not only was the division continually the most profitable in the company, but it also led the entire financial services industry. Despite these successes, Gerstner hit a ceiling at American Express, as chief executive James D. Robinson III was not expected to retire for another 12 years. During Gerstner's 11-year tenure at American Express, membership had increased from 8.6 million to 30.7 million. He left AmEx in 1989 to succeed Ross Johnson as chairman and chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco following its $25 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.  IBM  Gerstner was hired as chairman and CEO of IBM in April 1993. The company's board had forced his predecessor John Akers to resign, looking first within the computer industry for his successor. However Apple's John Sculley, Motorola chairman George Fisher, and Bill Gates of Microsoft were not interested (other rumored candidates included Eckhard Pfeiffer of Compaq and Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems). IBM then turned to Gerstner, an outsider with a record that suggested success whose older brother Richard had run the company's PC division until retiring due to health issues four years earlier. Gerstner was the first IBM CEO who was hired from outside the company. Upon becoming chief executive of IBM, Gerstner declared: \\"the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision\\", as he instead focused on execution, decisiveness, simplifying the organization for speed, and breaking the gridlock. Many expected heads to roll, yet Gerstner initially changed only the CFO, the HR chief, and three key line executives. In his memoir, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?, he describes his arrival at the company in April 1993, when an active plan was in place to dis-aggregate the company. The prevailing wisdom of the time held that IBM's core mainframe business was headed for obsolescence. The company's own management was in the process of allowing its various divisions to rebrand and manage themselves -- the so-called \\"Baby Blues.\\" Then-CEO John Akers decided that the logical and rational solution was to split IBM into autonomous business units (such as processors, storage, software, services, printers,) that could compete more effectively with competitors that were more focused and agile and had lower cost structures. Gerstner reversed this plan, realizing from his previous experiences at RJR and American Express that there remained a vital need for a broad-based information technology integrator. He discovered that the biggest problem that all major companies faced in 1993 was integrating all the separate computing technologies that were emerging at the time, and saw that IBM‚Äôs unique competitive advantage was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers ‚Äì a company that could represent more than piece parts or components‚Äîsomething he only learned by going beyond just listening to the proponents of different technologies within IBM. His choice to keep the company together was the defining decision of his tenure, as these gave IBM the capabilities to deliver complete IT solutions to customers. Services could be sold as an add-on to companies that had already bought IBM computers, while barely profitable pieces of hardware were used to open the door to more profitable deals. One of the strategic visions that Gerstner set for IBM in 1993 was to make e-business its heart and soul. He believed in the potential of B2B e-commerce and wanted to expand the application of the internet to more than just web-page browsing and consumer marketing. He argued that a network-centric approach would shift the workload from personal computers to larger enterprise-systems and allow the internet to be embedded into all aspects of business operations.IBM100 - e-business - Overview. Retrieved 7 June 2020 IBM‚Äôs initial vision for how e-business could transform the world included electronic debit services that would allow customers to place orders online and eventually shop at virtual stores, creating virtual databases of movies, books, and music that would be available from anywhere in the world, and more.IBM100 - e-business - Transforming the World. Retrieved 7 June 2020 Soon after, Gerstner announced e-business as IBM‚Äôs growth strategy and formed the IBM Internet Division, led by Irving Wladawsky-Berger. In 1996, IBM‚Äôs marketing department established the term e-business for any kind of business or commercial transaction conducted over the internet.Gerstner, L. (2002). Who says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround. pg 172. Under Gerstner, e-business transformed IBM and within six years, they became the market leader in providing the products and services needed to transform any of their customers businesses into a network- centric e-business. While IBM had been credited with turning the personal computer (PC) into a mainstream product, the company could no longer monopolize its market. A proliferation of cheaper IBM-compatible PC clones that used the same Intel chips and Microsoft operating system software simply undercut it and eroded market share. Outgoing IBM chairman and CEO Akers, a company lifer, was excessively immersed in its corporate culture, remaining loyal to traditional ways that masked the real threats. As an outsider, Gerstner had no emotional attachment to long-suffering products IBM had developed to try to regain control of the PC market. Gerstner wrote that in spite of OS/2's technical superiority to the dominant Microsoft Windows 3.0, his colleagues were \\"unwilling or unable to accept\\" that it was a \\"resounding defeat\\" as it \\"was draining tens of millions of dollars, absorbing huge chunks of senior management's time, and making a mockery of our image\\". By the end of 1994, IBM ceased new development of OS/2 software. IBM withdrew from the retail desktop PC market entirely, which had become unprofitable due to price pressures in the early 2000s. Three years after Gerstner's 2002 retirement, IBM sold the PC division to Lenovo. In his memoir, Gerstner described the turnaround as difficult and often wrenching for an IBM culture that had become insular and balkanized. After he arrived, over 100,000 employees were laid off from a company that had maintained a lifetime employment practice from its inception. Long allowed by their managers to believe that employment security had little reference to performance, thousands of IBM employees had grown lax, while the top-performing employees complained bitterly in attitude surveys. In the goal to create one common brand message for all IBM products and services around the world, under Gerstner's leadership the company consolidated its many advertising agencies down to just Ogilvy & Mather. Layoffs and other tough management measures continued in the first two years of his tenure, but the company was saved, and business success has continued to grow steadily since then. From 1993 to Gerstner's retirement in 2002, IBM's market capitalization rose from $29 billion to $168 billion. Despite his success Gerstner also presided over the company's decline, relative to newer rivals, as it lost its once-dominant position in the IT industry. Microsoft grew beyond just PC software in the 1990s, hardware companies Apple and Dell expanded their market share, and entirely new entities such as the Google search engine emerged and created new computer-based business empires. Gerstner was also the first highly-paid IBM CEO relative to his home-grown predecessors, earning a personal fortune of hundreds of millions in his role. His philosophy, quoted as \\"The importance of managers being aligned with shareholders‚Äînot through risk-free instruments like stock options, but through the process of putting their own money on the line through direct ownership of the company‚Äîbecame a critical part of the management philosophy I brought to IBM\\" has been criticized for IBM's management in the late 2000s becoming \\"fully isolated and immune from the long-term consequences of their decisions\\".  Post-IBM  In January 2003, Gerstner assumed the position of chairman of The Carlyle Group, a Washington, DC global private equity firm. He served as chairman from January 2003 until October 2008 and upon retiring from that position, he continued as a senior advisor to Carlyle through September 2016. Gerstner has held the position of chairman of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard since January 2013. Gerstner established the Gerstner Family Foundation in 1989 and serves as the chairman. The Foundation makes grants in Biomedical Research, Education, and Helping Hands. Since inception, Gerstner Philanthropies has made over $100 million in grants. Most recently, in 2019, over $15 million was granted across the three program areas.  Honors  In 1991, Gerstner received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In recognition of his work on behalf of public education, as well as his business accomplishments, Mr. Gerstner was awarded the designation of honorary Knight of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in June 2001. He has received numerous awards for his work in education, among them the Cleveland E. Dodge Medal for Distinguished Service to Education - Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Distinguished Service to Science and Education award from the American Museum of Natural History. In 2008, Gerstner received the Legend in Leadership Award from the Yale School of Management. References * * Gerstner, Jr., Louis V. (2002). Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

It starts at the confluence of the Ohau River and the Tekapo River, now in the head of the artificial Lake Benmore, these rivers being fed by three large glacial lakes, Pukaki, Tekapo, and Ohau. The Waitaki flows through Lake Benmore, Lake Aviemore and Lake Waitaki, these lakes being contained by hydroelectric dams, Benmore Dam, Aviemore Dam and Waitaki Dam.Waitaki River, An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966. Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 26-Sep-2006. The Waitaki has several tributaries, notably the Ahuriri River and the Hakataramea River. It passes Kurow and Glenavy before entering the Pacific Ocean. The river's flow is normally low in winter, with flows increasing in spring when the snow cloaking the Southern Alps begins to melt, with flows throughout the summer being rainfall dependent and then declining in the autumn as the colder weather begins to freeze the smaller streams and streams which feed the catchment. The median flow of the Waitaki River at Kurow is .Waitaki Catchment Hydrological Information, Table 3.2 Waitaki Catchment - Flow Statistics at Flow Recording Sites, February 2005, Ref. ME582, Ministry for the Environment website, retrieved 22 November 2007. The middle of the river bed formed a traditional political boundary between Canterbury and Otago. As such, the term \\"South of the Waitaki\\" is often used to refer to the Otago and Southland regions as one common area (the two regions share historical and ethnic relationships which make them distinct from the regions to the north of them). The river is popular for recreational fishing and jetboating. Electricity generation The river is the site of many hydroelectricity projects. The Waitaki dam was built first, between 1928 and 1934, and without earth-moving machinery, followed by the development of the Aviemore Dam, creating Lake Aviemore - and Benmore Dam, creating Lake Benmore. Lake Pukaki was initially dammed at this stage to provide storage and flow control. A small station was also installed on Lake Tekapo, with water taken through a tunnel to a powerstation below the level of the lake. The original Waitaki power stations discharge water back into the Waitaki River which then forms a storage lake for the next station in the chain. The three power stations are (commissioned/capacity/annual output): *Waitaki (1935/105 MW/500 GWh) *Benmore (1965/540 MW/2200 GWh) *Aviemore (1968/220 MW/940 GWh) In the 1960s, work was started on the Upper Waitaki project. This project consisted of taking the discharge from the original Tekapo (A) station through the Tekapo Canal, to Tekapo B station at the edge of Lake Pukaki. The dam at Pukaki was increased in height. Water from Pukaki is then transferred into the Pukaki Canal which meets the Ohau Canal from Lake Ohau into Ohau A station and Lake Ruataniwha. The Ohau Canal continues beyond Lake Ruataniwha to Ohau B midway along, before emptying through Ohau C into Lake Benmore. Tekapo Canal The stations are (commissioned/capacity/annual output): *Tekapo A (1955/25 MW/160 GWh) *Tekapo B (1977/160 MW/800 GWh) *Ohau A (1980/264 MW/1150 GWh) *Ohau B (1984-85/212 MW/970 GWh) *Ohau C (1984-85/212 MW/970 GWh) Later proposals In 2001 a proposal for a new series of canals and dams was made by Meridian Energy for irrigation and electricity generation on the river. This scheme, known as Project Aqua, planned to divert up to 77 percent of the lower river's flow to create a hydroelectric scheme, but these plans were dropped in March 2004. Lack of commercial viability was given as the major reason for the scheme's shelving, although strenuous public protest may also have been a major contributing factor. A more modest successor scheme, the North Bank tunnel looked likely to proceed, with water rights being granted in 2009, but land access negotiations were suspended in January 2013 due to flat demand for electricity forecast for the next five years.

It is located on the south bank of the Waitaki River, northwest of Oamaru. At the 2013 Census, the town had a population of 312 people. Description The name is an Anglicised form of the MƒÅori name of the nearby mountain, Te Kohurau. Which means 'a thousand mists'.Otago places In the 1920s, the town was the base for the building of the nearby Waitaki Dam and forming Lake Waitaki in the first of a series of hydroelectric projects on the Waitaki River. The first social security scheme for New Zealand workers was designed in the town, arising from Presbyterian Minister of Kurow Arnold Nordmeyer's experience of working with families of workers on the Waitaki hydro-electric project. Examples of pre- European MƒÅori cave paintings are close to the small settlement of Duntroon. The land around the town includes summerfruit orchards, and increasing amounts of Pinot noir are being planted in the limestone soils. The town was the terminus of the Kurow Branch railway, opened in 1881 to Hakataramea, across the Waitaki River, but cut back to Kurow in 1930. It closed in 1983: the line can be traced on the ground, and the station still building stands on Liverpool St. From 1928 until 1937, a line owned by the Public Works Department ran from Kurow to the hydroelectric project 6.4 km to the west. Notable people from Kurow include All Black captain Richie McCaw, All Black and rugby administrator Charles Saxton and mathematician Roy Kerr. From 1929 to 1934, Dr Gervan McMillan and his wife Ethel were residents of Kurow, with Dr McMillan running a medical practice there.

He was a reporter at 16, a newspaper editor by the age of 20, and a publisher at 32. He was a co- founder of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, a general in the US Army and the Philippine Army, university president, President of the UN General Assembly, was eventually named one of the Philippines' National Artists in Literature, and was the recipient of many other honors and honorary degrees. He was born in Camiling, Tarlac and he studied at the Camiling Central Elementary School during his basic education. Early Career Studying in the Philippines and the United States, Dr. Carlos Romulo became a professor of English at the University of the Philippines in 1923. Simultaneously, Romulo served as the secretary to the President of the Senate of the Philippines Manuel Quezon. During the 1930s, Romulo became the publisher and editor of The Philippines Herald, and one of his reporters was Yay Panlilio. At the start of WWII, Major Carlos Romulo served as an aide to General MacArthur, attaining the rank of general by the end of that war. Diplomatic career Romulo served eight Philippine presidents, from Manuel L. Quezon to Ferdinand Marcos, as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and as the country's representative to the United States and to the United Nations. He also served as the Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives during the Commonwealth era. In addition, he served also as the Secretary of Education in President Diosdado P. Macapagal's and President Ferdinand E. Marcos's Cabinet through 1962 to 1968. Resident Commissioner Romulo served as Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the United States Congress from 1944 to 1946. This was the title of the non-voting Delegate to the US House of Representatives for lands taken in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and as such, he is the only member of the US Congress to end his tenure via a legal secession from the Union. United Nations In his career in the United Nations, Romulo was a strong advocate of human rights, freedom, and decolonization. In 1948 in Paris, France, at the third UN General Assembly, he strongly disagreed with a proposal made by the Soviet delegation headed by Andrei Vishinsky, who challenged his credentials by insulting him with this quote: \\"You are just a little man from a little country.\\" In return, Romulo replied, \\"It is the duty of the little Davids of this world to fling the pebbles of truth in the eyes of the blustering Goliaths and force them to behave!\\", leaving Vishinsky with nothing left to do but sit down. Palestine Partition Plan In the days preceding the UN General Assembly vote on the Partition Plan for Palestine, Romulo stated \\"We hold that the issue is primarily moral. The issue is whether the United Nations should accept responsibility for the enforcement of a policy which is clearly repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine. The Philippines Government holds that the United Nations ought not to accept such responsibility.\\" Thus, he clearly intended to oppose the Partition Plan, or at most abstain in the vote. However, pressure on the Philippines government from Washington led to Romulo being recalled, replaced by a Philippines representative who voted in favor of the Partition Plan. =President of the UN General Assembly= He served as the President of the Fourth Session of United Nations General Assembly from 1949 to 1950‚Äîthe first Asian to hold the position‚Äîand served as president of the United Nations Security Council four times, twice in 1957, 1980 and 1981.Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Library. Retrieved 7 September 2013 He had served with General Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific, and became the first non-American to win the Pulitzer Prize in Correspondence in 1942. The Pulitzer Prize website says Carlos P. Romulo of the Philippine Herald was awarded \\"For his observations and forecasts of Far Eastern developments during a tour of the trouble centers from Hong Kong to Batavia.\\" =Campaign for Secretary-General= Romulo ran for the office of United Nations Secretary-General in the 1953 selection. He fell two votes short of the required 7-vote majority in the Security Council, finishing second to Lester B. Pearson of Canada. His ambitions were further dashed by negative votes from France and the Soviet Union, both of whom were permanent members with veto power. The Security Council eventually settled on a dark horse candidate and selected Dag Hammarskj√∂ld as Secretary-General of the United Nations. Ambassador to the United States From January 1952 to May 1953, Romulo became only the second former member of Congress to become the Ambassador to the United States from a foreign country, following Joaquin M. Elizalde, who had been his immediate predecessor in both posts. He later served as Ambassador again from September 1955 to February 1962.  Return to the Philippines  Philippine Presidential Aspiration Instead, he returned to the Philippines and was a candidate for the nomination as the presidential candidate for the Liberal Party, but lost at the party convention to the incumbent Elpidio Quirino, who ran unsuccessfully for re-election against Ramon Magsaysay. Quirino had agreed to a secret ballot at the convention, but after the convention opened, the president demanded an open roll-call voting, leaving the delegates no choice but supporting Quirino, the candidate of the party machine. Feeling betrayed, Romulo left the Liberal Party and became national campaign manager of Magsaysay, the candidate of the opposing Nacionalista Party who won the election. Romulo, portrait by Soshana, oil on canvas, 1945 Ang Paglulunsad Memorial, Lingayen, Pangasinan. Carlos P. Romulo launched on January 10, 1945 Philippine and Pacific troops to liberate Luzon Minister of Foreign Affairs He was the Philippines' Secretary (Minister from 1973 to 1984) of Foreign Affairs under President Elpidio Quirino from 1950 to 1952, under President Diosdado Macapagal from 1963 to 1964 and under President Ferdinand Marcos from 1968 to 1984. In April 1955 he led the Philippines' delegation to the Asian-African Conference at Bandung. Resignation from the Marcos Cabinet Romulo supported President Ferdinand Marcos through most of his presidency. But he resigned in 1983, soon after the assassination of Benigno Aquino, citing poor health. Gregorio Brillantes interviewed him in 1984, and he said he resigned \\"heartsick\\" because of the assassination of Aquino, whom he considered a \\"friend\\", and the resulting freefall of the Philippines' economy and international reputation.Brillantes, Gregorio. The Twilight of the General. National Midweek Vol. 1 No. 9. January 1, 1986. According to Beth Day Romulo, the Marcos administration had asked him to sign an ad that the administration was planning to place in the New York Times and other major international dailies. Carlos P. Romulo refused to sign the ad and instead resigned. Death He died, at 87, in Manila on 15 December 1985 and was buried in the Heroes' Cemetery (Libingan ng mga Bayani). He was honored as \\"one of the truly great statesmen of the 20th century.\\" In 1980, he was extolled by United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim as \\"Mr. United Nations\\" for his valuable services to the United Nations and his dedication to freedom and world peace. Published books Romulo, in all, wrote and published 22 books, which includes The United (novel), I Walked with Heroes (autobiography), I Saw the Fall of the Philippines, Mother America and I See the Philippines Rise (war-time memoirs).

Romulo with drinks and cigars, to which the general kindly refused. Their conversation went as follows: At this, Marshal Tito was tickled by his reply and loudly exclaimed around the room, \\"I etcetera, etcetera, etcetera!\\" Romulo was a dapper little man (barely five feet four inches in shoes). When they waded in at Leyte beach in October 1944, and the word went out that General MacArthur was waist deep, one of Romulo's journalist friends cabled, \\"If MacArthur was in water waist deep, Romulo must have drowned!\\" In later years, Romulo told another story himself about a meeting with MacArthur and other tall American generals who disparaged his physical stature. \\"Gentlemen,\\" he declared, \\"When you say something like that, you make me feel like a dime among nickels.\\" Books Carlos P.

It is Huxley's longest novel, and was notably more complex and serious than his earlier fiction. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Point Counter Point 44th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Title and construction The novel's title is a reference to the flow of arguments in a debate, and a series of these exchanges tell the story. Instead of a single central plot, there are a number of interlinked story lines and recurring themes (as in musical \\"counterpoint\\"). As a roman √† clef, many of the characters are based on real people, most of whom Huxley knew personally, such as D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Sir Oswald Mosley, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murry, and Huxley is depicted as the novel's novelist, Philip Quarles. Main characters and storylines Some of the main characters include: *Walter Bidlake, a young journalist. A weak and ineffectual man, Walter is living with Marjorie Carling, a married woman whose husband refuses to grant her a divorce. Marjorie is pregnant with Walter's child, but their relationship is disintegrating, largely because Walter has fallen desperately in love with the sexually aggressive and independent Lucy Tantamount (based on Nancy Cunard, with whom Huxley had a similarly unsatisfactory affair). His wife Ms Bidlake is inspired by Lady Ottoline Morrell. *John Bidlake, Walter's father, a painter (based on Augustus John). He is famous for his work and for his scandalous love life. However, his recent paintings show a creative decline, which he himself recognises but refuses to admit. He has an illness which is eventually diagnosed as terminal cancer. *Philip Quarles, a writer (a self- portrait of Huxley) and his wife Elinor, John Bidlake's daughter. They return from India to England. Quarles is a withdrawn, cerebral man, ill at ease with the everyday world and its emotions; Elinor loves him, but is tempted to enter into an affair with the bold and attractive Everard Webley, a political demagogue and leader of his own quasi-military group, the Brotherhood of British Freemen. (Webley is often assumed to be based on Oswald Mosley, but there are reasons for doubting this: see below.) Quarles' father, Sidney, is unlike his son: outwardly impressive, he is in reality pretentious, feeble and self-indulgent. An undistinguished MP and failed businessman, he has retired from public life, supposedly to concentrate on writing a vast and definitive study of democracy. In fact he has written nothing, but he employs a secretary; the girl becomes pregnant by him and threatens to make a scandal. Philip and Elinor have a young son, little Phil, who becomes ill and dies of meningitis. *Mark Rampion, a writer and painter. Based on D. H. Lawrence, whom Huxley admired greatly, Rampion is a fierce critic of modern society. A full chapter in flashback shows Rampion's courtship and marriage to his wife, Mary (based on Lawrence's wife Frieda). *Maurice Spandrell, an intellectual desperately and unsuccessfully searching for proof of the divine in his life (based on Charles Baudelaire, who of course did not live in Huxley's time). For years Spandrell has devoted himself to vice and deliberate wickedness in order to prompt a reaction from God. He has found some pleasure in the corruption of an innocent young girl, both in the act itself and in his own feelings of remorse, but when he is not divinely punished, he looks for an even larger sin to force God's hand. He believes that if there is no real evidence of God's existence, everything in life is pointless. He meets Illidge, a young scientist of working-class origin, and taunts him for his angry left-wing rhetoric and actual political impotence in order to persuade him into helping him murder Everard Webley. Tragically, there is still no obvious heavenly negative and personal consequences for this ultimate sin, except to strengthen Webley's Brotherhood of British Freemen. Spandrell sends an anonymous note to the Brotherhood, informing them that the murderer is at his address. He tries one last time to find God's presence in the world when he asks Rampion whether Beethoven's String Quartet No 15, played on the newly invented gramophone, (to symbolize the collision of science and technology with art) is an indication or proof of God. Rampion answers that even the sublimest of music, such as Beethoven's composition that they are listening to, is not a proof of God, this motivates Spandrell to call the police, essentially committing suicide, since when they arrive he allows himself to be shot and killed, while the third movement from Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 plays in the background. *Denis Burlap, Walter Bidlake's editor. Based on John Middleton Murry, Burlap is in his writings and public image a Christian and an anguished, self-accusing moralist; in his inner thoughts and private behaviour, however, he is calculating, avaricious and libidinous. He lives with Beatrice Gilray (based on Dorothy Brett, painter), who at thirty-five remains a virgin, having been molested as a young girl; for some time their relationship is platonic, but Burlap succeeds in seducing her. The novel ends with his having secured several thousand dollars for a book, St Francis and the Modern Psyche, and enjoying an evening of sensual pleasure with Beatrice. Comparison with Oswald Mosley Comparisons have been made between the character Everard Webley and his Brotherhood of British Freemen and Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. However, when Huxley wrote Point Counter Point, Mosley was still a prominent member of the Labour Party and would remain so until 1931. The BUF was not founded until 1932. A number of other fascist groups preceded Mosley, the most prominent being the British Fascists, and possibly one of those may have been Huxley's inspiration. In the 1996 reprint of Point Counter Point, Mosley's son Nicholas discusses the connection in a new introduction to the novel. David Bradshaw has argued that the most likely source for Webley is John Hargrave, the founder of The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. Aside from the question of which British fascist leader was meant, when the book was written in 1928, Hitler and his Nazi Party were still a marginal force in German politics, and British fascists looked mainly to Fascist Italy, which did not pose any kind of military threat to Britain. That makes a difference for the act of killing the fascist leader. Ten years later, the killing of a British fascist might have been considered a patriotic act, removing a potential collaborator with the Nazis, but in 1928, such an act was simply a pure manifestation of left-wing radicalism. Film and television adaptations The novel was adapted into a BBC mini-series by Simon Raven in 1968, starring Tristram Jellinek. It was later broadcast on PBS television in 1972.

The ciphers were developed based on a body of work analysing DES, and are very similar to DES in structure. The LOKI algorithms were named for Loki, the god of mischief in Norse mythology. LOKI89 LOKI89 was first published in 1990, then named just \\"LOKI\\", by Australian cryptographers Lawrie Brown, Josef Pieprzyk, and Jennifer Seberry. LOKI89 was submitted to the European RIPE project for evaluation, but was not selected. The cipher uses a 64-bit block and a 64-bit key. Like DES, it is a 16-round Feistel cipher and has a similar general structure, but differs in the choice of the particular S-boxes, the \\"P-permutation\\", and the \\"Expansion permutation\\". The S-boxes use the non- linearity criteria developed by Josef Pieprzyk, making them as \\"complex\\" and \\"unpredicatable\\" as possible. Their effectiveness was compared against the known design criteria for the DES S-boxes. The permutations were designed to \\"mix\\" the outputs of the S-boxes as quickly as possible, promoting the avalanche and completeness properties, essential for a good Feistel cipher. However unlike their equivalents in the DES, they are intended to be as clean and simple as possible (in retrospect perhaps a little too simple), aiding the analysis of the design. Following the publication of LOKI89, information on the new differential cryptanalysis became available, as well as some early analysis results by (Knudsen 1993a). This resulted in the design being changed to become LOKI91. LOKI91 LOKI 91 was designed in response to the attacks on LOKI89 (Brown et al., 1991). The changes included removing the initial and final key whitening, a new S-box, and small alterations to the key schedule. More specifically, the S-boxes were changed to minimise the probability of seeing different inputs resulting in the same output (a hook which Differential cryptanalysis uses), thus improving LOKI91's immunity to this attack, as detailed by the attacks authors (Biham and Shamir 1991). The changes to the key schedule were designed to reduce the number of \\"equivalent\\" or \\"related\\" keys, which resulted in the exhaustive search space for the cipher being reduced. Whilst the resulting cipher is clearly stronger and more secure than LOKI89, there are a number of potential attacks, as detailed in the papers by Knudsen and Biham. Consequently these ciphers should be viewed as academic efforts to advance the field of block cipher design, rather than algorithms for use. The number of citations and published critiques suggests this aim has been achieved.

Originally published as \\"Academie Royale Des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres,\\" Encyclop√©die ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers, 1:52 (Paris, 1751). In 1683 Minister Louvois increased the membership to eight. In 1701 its membership was expanded to 40 and reorganized under the leadership of Chancellor Pontchartrain. It met twice a week at the Louvre, its members began to receive significant pensions, and was made an official state institution on the king's decree. In January 1716 it was permanently renamed to the Acad√©mie royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres with the broader goal of elevating the prestige of the French monarchy using physical symbols uncovered or recovered through the methods of classical erudition. The Acad√©mie produced a catalogue of medals created in honor of Louis XIV, M√©dailles sur les √©v√©nements du r√®gne de Louis le Grand, avec des explications historiques, first published in 1702. A second edition was published in 1723, eight years after Louis' death. Each page of the catalogue featured engraved images of the obverse and reverse of a single medal, followed by a lengthy description of the event upon which it was based. The second edition added some medals for events prior to 1700 which were not included in the first volume, and in some cases the images of medals in the earlier edition were altered, resulting in an improved version. The catalogues may therefore be seen as an artistic effort to enhance the king's image, rather than as an accurate historical record. Role In the words of the Acad√©mie's charter, it is: > primarily concerned with the study of the monuments, the documents, the > languages, and the cultures of the civilizations of antiquity, the Middle > Ages, and the classical period, as well as those of non-European > civilizations. Today the academy is composed of fifty-five French members, forty associate foreign members, fifty French corresponding members, and fifty foreign corresponding members. The seats are distributed evenly among \\"orientalists\\" (scholars of Asia and the Islamic world, from ancient times), \\"antiquists\\" (scholars of Greece, Rome, and Gaul, including archaeologists, numismatists, philologists and historians), \\"medievalists\\", and a fourth miscellaneous group of linguists, law historians, historians of religion, historians of thought, and prehistorians.

Three Exclusion bills sought to exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland because he was Roman Catholic. None became law. Two new parties formed. The Tories were opposed to this exclusion while the \\"Country Party\\", who were soon to be called the Whigs, supported it. While the matter of James's exclusion was not decided in Parliament during Charles's reign, it would come to a head only three years after he took the throne, when he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Finally, the Act of Settlement 1701 decided definitively that Catholics were to be excluded from the English throne. Background the Duke of York as Lord High Admiral of England. In 1673, the Duke of York, who had converted to Catholicism, resigned as Lord High Admiral rather than take the anti-Catholic oath prescribed by the Test Act. cardinals, friars, and nuns paraded through the streets of London and then burned in a large bonfire. In 1673, when he refused to take the oath prescribed by the new Test Act, it became publicly known that the Duke of York was a Roman Catholic. His secretary, Edward Colman, had been named by Titus Oates during the Popish Plot (1678) as a conspirator to subvert the kingdom. Members of the Anglican English establishment could see that in France a Catholic king was ruling in an absolutist way, and a movement gathered strength to avoid such a form of monarchy from developing in England, as many feared it would if James were to succeed his brother Charles, who had no legitimate children. Sir Henry Capel summarised the general feeling of the country when he said in a parliamentary debate in the House of Commons of England on 27 April 1679: Crises The occasion which brought these sentiments to a head was the impeachment of Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, as a scapegoat for a scandal by which Louis XIV bought the neutrality of Charles's government with an outright bribe. Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament, but the new Parliament which assembled on 6 March 1679 was even more hostile to the king and to his unfortunate minister, thus Danby was committed to the Tower of London. The Earl of Shaftesbury, the leader of the Whigs who introduced the Exclusion Bill in the House of Commons on 15 May 1679. On 15 May 1679, the supporters of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, introduced the Exclusion bill in the Commons with the intention of excluding James from the succession to the throne. A fringe group there began to support the claim to the throne of Charles's illegitimate ‚Äì but Protestant ‚Äì son, the Duke of Monmouth. As it seemed likely that the bill would pass in the House of Commons, Charles exercised his royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament again. Successive Parliaments attempted to pass such a bill, and were likewise dissolved. End of the Crisis While it should be treated with caution, the Exclusion Crisis is often identified as the point at which discernible political parties first emerged in England. Those who supported petitions asking Charles to recall Parliament and complete the passage of the Exclusion Bill were known as 'Petitioners' and later became Whigs. Those who opposed the Bill or so-called Abhorrers developed into the Tories. The nature of politics in this period is illustrated by the fact that Shaftesbury, who opposed James due to his similarities to the absolutist Catholic French regime, was supported financially by Louis XIV of France who saw benefit in deepening English internal divisions. The Popish Plot was used by the Whigs to mobilise support but moderates grew increasingly concerned by the hysteria it generated which caused the execution of 22 'conspirators' and accused the Queen of conspiring to poison her husband. Many of Shaftesbury's supporters like the Earl of Huntingdon now switched sides and after two failed attempts to pass the Bill, Charles succeeded in labelling the Whigs as subversives. Louis now switched financial support to Charles, allowing him to dissolve the 1681 Oxford Parliament. It was not called again during his reign, depriving the Whigs of their main source of political support, i.e., government patronage; the failed 1683 Rye House Plot then completed their isolation. One long-lasting result of the crisis was the codification of the writ of Habeas Corpus: the one concrete achievement of the short-lived Habeas Corpus Parliament of 1679 before it was dissolved. In passing this act, the Whig leaders were concerned for their own persons, apprehensive (correctly) that the King would try to move against them through the courts. But the act far outlived the specific crisis, having long-term implications for the British legal system (and later, the American one). In fiction Robert Neill's 1972 historical novel The Golden Days depicts the Exclusion Crisis as experienced by two Members of Parliament representing a rural constituency. Sir Harry Burnaby is a staunch Royalist who had been knighted for having helped Charles II's Restoration; his neighbour and fellow MP is Richard Gibson, an ex-Colonel in Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, and an outspoken member of the Green Ribbon Club and of the emerging Whig party. Despite their sharp political differences, Burnaby and Gibson come to deeply respect each other, and they share the anxiety lest the unfolding crisis escalate beyond control and England be plunged again into all-out civil war. Eventually, Burnaby's son marries Gibson's daughter, with the full blessing of both fathers.

He was a student of Francis Hayman. He is perhaps best remembered for his portrait of Benjamin Franklin. Life Chamberlin was a pupil of Francis Hayman. In 1768 he was one of the founding members of the Royal Academy. He exhibited 50 works at the academy between 1769 and 1786. All were portraits. The subjects of most of them are unnamed in the catalogues, but in 1771 he showed a full-length painting of Prince Edward and Princess Augusta, and in 1774 one of Catharine Macaulay. He also showed 22 works at the Society of Artists and two at the Free Society of Artists. His address is given as 7, Stuart Street, Spitalfields in the Academy catalogues, and later, from 1785, as 10, Bartlett's Buildings. Franklin portrait Chamberlin‚Äôs portrait of Benjamin Franklin (1762) He is perhaps best known for a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, commissioned by wealthy Virginian landowner and friend of Franklin's in London, Colonel Philip Ludwell III, and painted from life in 1762. It shows Franklin seated in his study with lightning striking outside the window in the background, and a lightning rod on his house. He looks to the left at a set of lightning bells (a device of his own invention), which would ring to signal when lightning was striking the rod. Franklin could then use the electricity in order to perform his experiments. Later in 1762 (or early 1763) a popular mezzotint was made after it (possibly as part of the agreement between Chamberlin and Ludwell), by the Irish-born engraver Edward Fisher (1730‚Äì1785). Franklin's son William ordered 100 copies to sell in America, 18 of which Franklin distributed himself, mostly to friends in New England such as Mather Byles, Ezra Stiles, and his niece's husband, Jonathan Williams. This was Franklin's favorite print during the time, partially because of the accurate likeness. The original painting is owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Franklin's son William also commissioned a replica of this painting to be made, for Franklin to give him as a gift to hang in the dining room of William's new home ‚Äî the copy is presumed to have been sent to America, but has since been destroyed. Death He died at Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, on 20 January 1787. Family His son, also called Mason, was a prolific painter who exhibited 68 landscapes in London between 1780 and 1827, of which 58 were shown at the Royal Academy.

History  Jaschan lived in the village of Waffensen, Germany, and attended a computer science school in nearby Rotenburg. He was a shy & quiet person. He admitted writing and releasing the two damaging worms when arrested by German police on 7 May 2004 after a three- month-long international investigation. Following his arrest, Microsoft confirmed that they had received tip-offs from more than one source, and that the $250,000 reward for identifying the author of the NetSky worm would be shared between them. A Microsoft official attended the arrest and the initial interrogation. Some sources claim that at least one tip-off came from a classmate of Jaschan's to whom he had boasted of his activities. Several of Jaschan's classmates also came under investigation following Jaschan's arrest. There was also speculation that he had written the worms to drum up business for his mother and stepfather's PC support business and was actively working on an antidote to the worm. \\"Sasser Arrest\\", Sophos.com, modified and retrieved November 7, 2006. In an interview in July 2004, Jaschan claimed to have written the Netsky worms in order to remove infection with Mydoom and Bagle worms from victims' computers. He also confirmed that a classmate had given a tip to Microsoft.  Sasser Worm Damage and subsequent arrest  A report by Sophos in August 2004 claimed that Jaschan's viruses were responsible for 70% of the infections seen in the first half of that year. Following his initial arrest, Jaschan was released pending trial. Several companies and institutions have posted damage claims against him. According to the Rotenburg-Wuemme State Court, four German lawsuits were settled for under $1,000 each. Jaschan was tried as a minor because the German courts determined that he created the virus before he was 18. The virus was released on his 18th birthday (April 29, 2004). Sven Jaschan was found guilty of computer sabotage and illegally altering data. On Friday, July 8, 2005, he received a 21-month suspended sentence.

She was found guilty of treason for an affair with a German officer during World War II, but she continued her career which included playing Blanche in the French version of A Streetcar Named Desire. Early years Arletty was born in Courbevoie (near Paris), to a working-class family. After her father's death, she left home and pursued a modeling career. She took the stage name \\"Arlette\\" based on the heroine of a story by Guy de Maupassant. She was not interested in acting until she met Paul Guillaume, an art dealer. He recommended some theaters and, at the age of 21, she was hired. Her early career was dominated by the music hall, and she later appeared in plays and cabaret. Arletty was a stage performer for ten years before her film debut in 1930. Arletty's career took off around 1936 when she appeared as the leading lady in the stage plays Les Joies du Capitole and Fric-Frac, in which she starred opposite Michel Simon. She later starred as Blanche in the French version of A Streetcar Named Desire.Felando, Cynthia. \\"Arletty.\\" International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers. Ed.

For this role she earned one of the highest salaries ever in French cinema.Aldstadt, David. (2002).

She allegedly later commented on the experience, \\"My heart is French but my ass is international.\\"Geoffrey Nowell Smith, The Oxford History of World Cinema, p. 347. See also Arletty, allocine.fr: \\"mon coeur est fran√ßais mais mon cul est international !\\" The quotation in French is, \\"Si mon c≈ìur est fran√ßais, mon cul, lui, est international\\" and the word \\"cul\\" is also translated \\"sex.\\" The French version of Wikipedia says the phrase was suggested by Henri Jeanson, but is perhaps apocryphal. Although other French women fell in love with German soldiers, her romantic affiliation with Soehring during the German occupation prompted a charge of treason. James Lord wrote of her special treatment: > Arletty was too well known for the mere humiliation of having her head > shaved, her naked skull tarred with a swastika and in this abject state > paraded through the streets to confront the jeers and spittle of the mob. > Prison would be none too good for her, people said, looking forward to > severe retribution for the moral treason of which they found her guilty. For her crimes she received a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment, most of which was served in a private chateau. Later years After a moderately successful period as a stage actress in later life she was forced to retire into private life due to progressive loss of her eyesight. One of her final screen appearances was in a small role as an elderly French woman in The Longest Day (1962). After her death in 1992, Arletty was cremated, and her ashes interred in her hometown at the Nouveau Cimeti√®re de Courbevoie. Legacy In 1995 the government of France issued a series of limited edition coins to commemorate the centenary of film that included a 100 Franc coin bearing the image of Arletty.

Since November 2015, he is a member of the Advisory Commission of the State Council of the Russian Federation. Over the years, he has come under criticism from international organisations for a wide array of human rights abuses under his watch, with Human Rights Watch calling the forced disappearances and torture so widespread they constituted crimes against humanity. During his tenure, he has advocated to restrict the public lives of women, and led a campaign for mass detention of those who are suspected to have engaged in homosexual behavior. Biography Early life and militia leader Akhmad Kadyrov, father of Ramzan and formerly a leading separatist mufti, had switched sides in 2000 He was born in Tsentaroy, RSFSR, USSR. He was the second son in Akhmat and Aimani Kadyrovs' family and their youngest child. He had an elder brother called Zelimkhan (1974 ‚Äì 31 May 2004), and he has two elder sisters, Zargan (born 1971) and Zulay (born 1972). Kadyrov strove to gain the respect of his father, Akhmad Kadyrov, who was an imam. He claims that he always emulated his father. Akhmad had supported the call for jihad against Russians during the First Chechen War but switched sides and declared allegiance to Russia in the Second Chechen War. In the early 1990s, as the Soviet Union dissolved, the Chechens launched a bid for independence. During the First Chechen War, together with his father, he fought against Russian armed forces. After the war, Ramzan was the personal driver and bodyguard of his father Akhmad, who became the separatist mufti of Chechnya. The Kadyrovtsy militia was formed during the First Chechen War when Akhmad Kadyrov launched the jihad against Russia. The Kadyrov family defected to the Moscow side at the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999. Since then, Kadyrov led his militia with support from Russia's FSB state security service (including service ID cards) becoming the head of the Chechen Presidential Security Service. The militia later became known as the Kadyrovites. Ramzan Kadyrov was falsely rumoured to have died of a gunshot wound inflicted by his bodyguard on 28 April 2004.Discrepant reports about Kadyrov, Jr. ‚Äì Kavkazcenter.com Deputy Prime Minister After his father, the then President, was assassinated on 9 May 2004, Ramzan was appointed as the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic on 10 May 2004. When his sister was detained by the Dagestan police in January 2005, Ramzan and some 150 armed men drove to the Khasavyurt City Police (GOVD) building. According to the city mayor, Kadyrov's men surrounded the GOVD, forcing its duty officers against a wall, and assaulted them, after which they left the building with Zulay Kadyrova, \\"victoriously shooting in the air.\\" In August 2005, Ramzan declared that \\"Europe's largest mosque\\" would be built in place of the demolished ruins of Grozny's shattered downtown. He also claimed that Chechnya is the \\"most peaceful place in Russia\\" and in a few years it would also be \\"the wealthiest and the most peaceful\\" place in the world. He said that the war was already over with only 150 \\"bandits\\" remaining (as opposed to the official figures of 700 to 2,000 rebel fighters), and that thanks to his father, 7,000 separatists had already defected to the Russian side since 1999. When responding to a question on how he is going to \\"avenge the murder of his father\\", Ramzan said: He remained the First Deputy Prime Minister until November 2005. Acting Prime Minister From left to right: President Alu Alkhanov, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Kadyrov at the first session of the Chechen Parliament in December 2005. Following a car accident in November 2005, in which Chechnya's prime minister Sergey Abramov was injured, Ramzan was appointed as the caretaker prime minister on 18 November 2005. He immediately proceeded to implement elements of Sharia law, such as declaring a ban on gambling and alcohol production. In February 2006, responding to the publication of the Mohammed cartoons, he accused the Danes of \\"spying\\" and being \\"pro-terrorist\\". He also banned Danish citizens from entering Chechnya, effectively banning activity of the Danish Refugee Council, the largest NGO working in the region. Kadyrov is quoted as saying, \\"That cartoonist needs to be buried alive.\\" He was eventually pressed to overturn this decision by Moscow, a rare example of federal intervention in Kadyrov's rule in the republic. Prime Minister On 1 March 2006, Sergey Abramov resigned from the position of prime minister and told Itar-Tass news agency that he did so \\"on the condition that Ramzan Kadyrov lead the Chechen government.\\" This was followed by a decree of Kadyrov forcing women to wear headscarves; he also rejected a federal appropriation of the republic's budget, demanding more money, and called for all federal forces but the border guards to be withdrawn. Kadyrov was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic by Alkhanov on 4 March 2006. Shortly after taking office, Kadyrov approved a project to erect a presidential palace on a plot by the Sunzha River in ruined downtown Grozny. The project, which was also to include a five-star hotel and recreational facilities, was estimated to cost around 1.5 billion rubles ($54 million USD) to build. Later, Kadyrov called for refugee camps scattered across Chechnya to be closed down, calling the refugees \\"international spies who are interested in stoking conflict between Chechnya and Russia, who are seeking to destabilise the situation in our region\\". Reuters quoted him as saying that \\"liquidating the refugee camps will allow us to uncover spies who are working for foreign intelligence services\\". His cousin Odes Baysultanov was appointed to the position of First Deputy Prime Minister by Alkhanov on 6 March 2006 after being unanimously approved by the Chechen Parliament. On 5 June 2006, Speaker of the Chechen People's Assembly Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov said at a press conference in Moscow that \\"there is no alternative\\" to Kadyrov for the presidency; Kadyrov has \\"exclusive awards in combat, and has made achievements in improving the peaceful life and in human rights protection. Who could replace him at this stage? Nobody,\\" he said. Later that year, Umar Dzhabrailov, Chechnya's representative in the Federation Council and a close ally of Kadyrov's, urged Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov to initiate a measure calling on Kadyrov to become the republic's president, thereby replacing Alu Alkhanov. The following week, several Russian newspapers reported that a worsening security situation in Chechnya was lessening the likelihood that Kadyrov would replace Alu Alkhanov as the republic's president. Other media, however, reported that Kadyrov continued to strengthen his position at Alkhanov's expense. He was also elected as the Chair of the Chechen Peoples' Assembly in late-October 2006. On 6 December 2006, Kadyrov said that he would seek the prosecution of the commanders of federal military units responsible for the death or disappearance of civilians in Chechnya (specifically Major General Aleksandr Studenikin). In addition, Kadyrov said the war in Chechnya was unleashed not by the Chechen people but by the Russian leadership. Kadyrov's comments may have represented his government's increasing unhappiness with certain figures in Moscow, who were said to be blocking his elevation to the post of Chechen president. In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia's Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime \\"water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea\\", and a report that Ramzan Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a \\"five-kilo lump of gold\\". On 5 February 2007, Kadyrov said he did not aspire to become the Chechen president; however, he criticised Alkhanov. Kadyrov also claimed the war in Chechnya was ultimately finished, with \\"all informal armed groups eliminated\\". Alkhanov, for his part, criticised \\"the cult of personality and idealisation of one person\\", a clear reference to Kadyrov, whose enormous portraits are prominently displayed in Grozny. President of the Chechen Republic Kadyrov (right) with Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2008 On 15 February 2007, Putin signed a decree removing Alkhanov and installing Kadyrov as Chechen's acting president. On 2 March 2007, following Putin's nomination of Kadyrov as Chechen president, the Chechen parliament approved the nomination.Chechen parliament votes for appointing Ramzan Kadyrov as president ‚Äì Russian News ‚Äì REGNUM In the following days, serious changes took place in the administrative setup of the republic, affecting both the top- and middle-ranking officials. Former deputy prime minister Odes Baysultanov (a cousin of Kadyrov) was elevated to the vacant post of prime minister. Critics allege that Ramzan Kadyrov is actively building his own \\"vertical of power\\" in the republic, and encouraging nepotism by placing men of his own family(Kadyrov) in all the leading and important positions. A Russian daily, Gazeta, reported that according to a poll conducted by the independent Levada Center, only 33 percent of Russians believe that Ramzan Kadyrov can be trusted, while 35 percent believed that he cannot. Asked whether they thought Kadyrov could normalise the situation in Chechnya and end the bloodshed there, 31 percent said yes and 38 percent said no. On 14 March 2007, Kadyrov said that human rights abuses were \\"a thing of the past\\" in his republic, rejecting new charges of torture made by the Council of Europe. Two days later he accused the federal authorities of torturing detainees. On 19 March 2007, Kadyrov vowed to put an end to all remaining guerilla activity in Chechnya within two months. On 5 April 2007, Kadyrov was sworn in as President of Chechnya.\\"Kadyrov sworn in as Chechnya's new Kremlin-backed president\\" , Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 5 April 2007. He appointed his maternal cousin Odes Baysultanov as the Prime Minister of the republic on 10 April. Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque completed in 2008 After the car-bomb attack on Yunus-bek Yevkurov, president of the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia on 22 June 2009, Kadyrov claimed that the Kremlin had ordered him to fight insurgents there, and during his subsequent visit to the republic on 24 June pledged ruthless vengeance. In late December 2009, Kadyrov claimed that remaining rebels were getting financed by \\"The West\\"; \\"I officially declare this: those who destroyed the Soviet Union, those who want to destroy the Russian Federation, they stand behind them\\". He also suggested that Russia should attack Georgia and Ukraine \\"It's Russia's private affliction; why should we always suffer if we can eradicate this for good?\\".Chechen President Says the West Wants to Destroy Russia , The Telegraph, (21 December 2009) In early August 2010, Kadyrov had claimed that there were only 70 Islamist militants left in Chechnya. In the same month, he proposed changing the title of President of the Chechen Republic to Head of the Chechen Republic. On 12 August, he also called upon presidents of all North Caucasus republics to petition the State Duma to change their titles, stating that there should only be one president in Russia. The Chechen parliament unanimously approved this change on 2 September. However, Speaker of the Chechen Parliament Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov stated on 4 September that the title will be retained until the end of Kadyrov's term in April 2011. In February 2011, he invited the players of Brazil's 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team to play a match against a Chechen football team led by Kadyrov. The Brazilian team was named as Brazil XI. In addition, Ruud Gullit was hired by Kadyrov to train FC Terek Grozny. =Attempts at consolidation of the Chechen nation= As reported by the Caucasian Knot, an independent human rights resource, on 5 February 2009, \\"in the course of his meeting in Grozny with Ramzan Ampukaev, representative of the Chechen Diaspora in Europe, Ramzan Kadyrov invited former militants, now living in Europe, to come back home\\": :\\"Now, the situation in the republic has stabilized, we witness a steady economic growth, and there's no sense for people to leave. And those who are already abroad, can always come back. We'll help them in every possible way,\\" said Mr. Kadyrov. \\"All sorts of Emirs and former participants of illegal armed formations, who are now in Europe and whose actions were not aggravated by bloody crimes, have two alternatives: either to come back and serve for the welfare of their homeland, or stay there until the end of their days.\\" =Tsentoroy and Chechen Parliament attacks= In 2010, two large scale attacks were carried out by Chechen insurgents, one in Kadyrov's home-village Tsentoroy and the other on Chechen Parliament in Grozny.\\"Chechen Commanders Rebel Against Umarov\\", RFE/RL, 13 August 2010.\\"Chechen Rebel Field Commanders Renounced Loyalty Oath to Doku Umarov\\" . Eurasia Daily Monitor, Volume 7, Issue 182. Jamestown Foundation, 8 October 2010. The assault on Tsentoroy which occurred on 29 August is considered to have \\"shattered\\" the image of Kadyrov's unshakeable rule in Chechnya, as it was the first time in six years that his seemingly impregnable village had come under attack. On 2 September, Ramzan Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted as an indicator of the government's weakness. Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave in the days after the attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels. The attack on the Chechen parliament was carried out by three Chechen rebels on 19 October 2010. Kadyrov dressed in a parade uniform attended a meeting that was held a few hours after all the buildings of the parliament were declared cleared by the special forces. During the meeting, he apologised to the politicians who escaped unhurt from the attack. Kadyrov vowed to intensify the fight against militants in the republic, calling them \\"bandits\\". He also blamed the United Kingdom and Poland saying they were \\"harbouring criminals. Why do they shield bandits who have shed blood where there is western democracy? Where is the justice? ... Sooner or later Zakayev, Gakayev, Umarov, Vadalov and other criminals will get what they deserve ... I have no doubt that it was the drunk and alcoholic Akhmed Zakayev and his backers in London and other western capitals. I want to say that they will not achieve anything.

Washington, Tom. \\"Kadyrov blames London for Grozny attack\\" . The Moscow News, 20 October 2010. Head of the Chechen Republic Kadyrov in 2014 Kadyrov was nominated by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 28 February 2011 and was unanimously elected for a second term by the Chechen Parliament on 5 March 2011. After his election, he stated that he was going to continue the current course of reviving the republic's economy and society. On 8 March, he captained a Chechen football team which included current players of FC Terek Grozny, former players of Soviet Union national football team and former German midfielder Lothar Matthaeus in a match against the team Brazil XI which included ex-Brazilian footballers like Romario, Dunga, Bebeto and Cafu. Kadyrov scored twice during the match but his team lost 6‚Äì4 to the Brazilian side. Kadyrov said that he had organised the match to show that Chechnya had recovered from years of separatist conflict. He also said that the Brazilians weren't paid to appear but came out of goodwill and in return for a donation to flood victims in Brazil. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Ramzan Kadyrov at the grave of the first President of Chechnya Akhmad Kadyrov in June 2012 Kadyrov was sworn in as head of the republic on 5 April 2011. In November 2012, he visited Azerbaijan to sign intergovernmental agreements. In December 2012, he ordered the closure of the newspaper Kadyrov's Path after one of its reporters asked Putin a question about the violence once focused in Chechnya spreading to other republics and followed it up by asking about the fate of a local radio station. Kadyrov had reportedly taken a disliking to the question asked by the reporter to Putin. Kadyrov termed former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster as a \\"coup d'etat\\" and a deliberate attempt to exert pressure on Russia through Ukraine, however at the same time placed the blame on Yanukovych for the situation in Ukraine. On 28 February 2014, he affirmed his readiness to dispatch peacekeepers and a consignment of humanitarian aid to Crimea. After the 2014 Grozny bombing, in which ISIL's hand was suspected, he said that he might block internet in Chechnya as anyone could easily find and listen to a sermon by a jihadist. After Kadyrov went on a tirade against ISIL on Instagram for threatening Russia, ISIL commander Omar al-Shishani put a $5 million bounty on him. On 26 May 2015, he announced that he was going to star in a Hollywood thriller titled Whoever Doesn't Understand Will Get It which will be directed by a director of famous Hollywood films and also feature global film-stars. Kadyrov in July 2015 denied that ISIL had any territory in Chechnya and claimed that they never will. During an interview in October 2015, he suggested that Putin should send Chechen special forces to Syria claiming they will wipe out ISIL in weeks. On 3 December, he promised revenge against ISIL for beheading of Magomed Khasiev. On 8 February 2016, he claimed that Chechen special forces had infiltrated ISIL cells. Kadyrov announced on 27 February 2016 that he would step down at the end of his second term, which was set to expire on 5 April. However, he later decided to run in the elections that were to be held that September. Putin appointed him as the acting head of Chechnya until the elections in a decree signed on 25 March. He held a meeting with Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman's deputy Ahmed al-Khatib on 8 May relating to Saudi Arabia investing in projects in Chechnya and declared that relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia were at an \\"all-time high\\". Kadyrov launched his reality show titled The Team with the first episode being aired by Channel One on 30 June. People from across Russia were invited by Kadyrov to register for the contest. The winner of the contest will go on to become head of Chechnya's Agency for Strategic Development. On 18 September 2016, Kadyrov was re-elected with nearly 98% of the vote. Philip Varychenko, a native of D√ºsseldorf, was chosen as the winner of Kadyrov's reality show on 22 November and was appointed as a government aide. Kadyrov visited Saudi Arabia on 27 November where he met the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During the meeting, they discussed Russia‚ÄìSaudi Arabia relations as well as issues of common interest. He also visited the United Arab Emirates on the same day and met Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The two discussed friendship, cooperation and strengthening ties. During his visits, he praised King Salman of Saudi Arabia for his \\"leadership of the Muslim world and efforts to combat extremism\\". On 28 November, he stated that veterans of American special forces would not be allowed to train security and intelligence personnel at a \\"tactical city\\" in Gudermes because \\"they weren't as good as Russian special forces and there were sanctions against all official structures from the United States.\\" On 29 November, he claimed in an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat that only a few dozen Chechens were fighting with ISIL, adding that most of them grew up in Western Europe. He also stated that measures taken by Chechen authorities had been successful in bringing back many young recruits before they reached Syria. During an interview aired on 27 November 2017, Kadyrov stated that he was ready to resign as Head of the Chechen Republic, calling it his \\"dream\\" as he found the responsibility to be \\"too heavy\\". He announced on 5 December that no Chechen athletes will participate under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics. After an attack on the Church of Archangel Michael in Grozny on 19 May 2018, Kadyrov stated that he had personally overseen the operation to eliminate the attackers. On September 26, he signed an agreement with Yunus- bek Yevkurov, the Head of Ingushetia, resolving the border dispute between the two Russian republics. The agreement seen as grossly unfair to Ingushestia ignited widespread protests eventually leading to resignation of Yevkurov on 24 June 2019. =COVID-19 pandemic= During the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, Kadyrov initially in March dismissed the spread of the disease as nothing serious. Later, Chechnya imposed strict measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after it first emerged in the republic. In an interview to Caucasian Knot, Kadyrov purportedly stated that infected people violating self-quarantine should be killed. People accused of spreading rumors have also been forced to admit their guilt and apologize on live television broadcasts by Kadyrov, though human rights organizations have claimed they were pressured. In April 2020, Kadyrov announced imposition of even stricter measures in Chechnya to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to a night curfew, the government also sealed off all transportation to regions outside the republic. Kadyrov meanwhile also denied that force was being used against those who defied the restrictions. After the Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin criticized heads of Russian regions for overstepping the extent of their powers with the restrictions they imposed, Kadyrov commented that while he didn't know if Mishustin referred to Chechnya, but goods as well as entry into the republic was not barred. However, entry of non-Chechens into the republic would be banned to curb the spread of the disease. On 15 May 2020, Kadyrov in a live broadcast on the state-run Grozny TV stated that medical workers protesting over lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) must be sacked after one such protest occurred in Gudermes, claiming the republic had enough PPE. On 20 May, Kadyrov was reportedly flown to Moscow after developing \\"flu-like symptoms\\", suspected to be COVID-19. On 26 May however, Kadyrov attended a televised meeting in Grozny for taking steps against the coronavirus. The next day he stated that he had a right to be sick, without confirming if he had fallen ill. He also dismissed reports of using a catheter, stating he had a right to use it to boost his immunity.

In February 2010, head of the British delegation of the Human Rights Group Lord Judd, formerly \\"bitterly critical of the Russian authorities for the situation in Chechnya\\", pointed out a striking change for the better in the Russian North Caucasus republic. Judd said that changes which occurred since his visit as a member of PACE delegation in 2000 were \\"so overwhelming that sometimes you forget about what happened here until quite recently\\". According to a 2016 report by Russian opposition leader Ilya Yashin, Kadyrov collected enormous wealth, primarily through theft of federal subsidies for Chechnya. Between 2001 and 2014 Chechnya has received over 464 billion roubles in subsidies, grants and donations with federal subsidies accounting for 80% of the republic's budget (and this does not include funds allocated for infrastructure managed at federal level such as roads). However, the administration of Chechnya is being criticized for spending public funds for their personal benefit‚Äîin 2010 Dmitry Medvedev noted that \\"federal funds often do not reach people; we know where they disappear; it is obvious-they are being stolen\\". For example, the fleet of official vehicles in Chechnya accounts for half of all official vehicles in all Northern Caucasus republics. Public funds are being funnelled through Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation, which‚Äîwhile being registered as a charity‚Äîhas never produced or published any financial reports as required by Russian law. These violations are ignored by Russian Ministry of Justice, which in many cases has enforced them very strictly against other charities. The foundation operates a building company that services most of the publicly procured infrastructure projects in the republic and also collects a fee from all working citizens of Chechnya, ranging from 10 to 30% of their earnings, raising 3‚Äì4 billion roubles per year this way. Kadyrov himself declares annual income of 4.84 million roubles (2015), which is inconsistent with his lavish life-style, luxury vehicles, watches, race horses and mansions. In 2020 Proekt.media published an in-depth analysis of business operations of Kadyrov and Adam Delimkhanov who are allegedly running multi-million dollar businesses in Moscow through a proxy provided by businessman Pavel Krotov.  2009 assassination attempt  An assassination attempt on Kadyrov and a parliament member Adam Delimkhanov was averted on 23 October 2009, by the police. Chechen Deputy interior minister Roman Edilov said the police shot dead the driver of a speeding car loaded with a 200-litre tank after firing warning shots shortly before Kadyrov was to arrive at a construction site. The driver of the car was later identified as a militant leader (so-called Urus-Martan emir Beslan Bashtayev).Chechnya says assassination attempt on Kadyrov averted. RIA Novosti. 23 October 2009.Attempted assailant of Chechen president identified, Interfax-Ukraine Said-Emi Khizriev, who played a role in organising the attack, was killed by Russian police who tried to arrest him in the Michurin village in Grozny.Russian police killed Chechen militant leader. RIA Novosti. 23 October 2009. Khizriev planned and took part in explosions at two gas stations in Gudermes in the spring of the previous year, as well as in an armed attack at a sport club in the city.  Accusations of human rights abuses  Kadyrov with Chechnya's parliamentary chairman Magomed Daudov in June 2016 Kadyrov has been personally implicated in several instances of torture and murder. A number of Chechens opposed to Kadyrov have been assassinated abroad, and several witnesses (including Artur Kurmakaev and Ruslan Khalidov) report the existence of a 300 name \\"Murder List\\". Chechens who have been murdered, where Kadyrov's involvement is suspected, include Movladi Baisarov and Ruslan Yamadaev (both Moscow); Sulim Yamadaev (Dubai); Gazhi Edilsutanov, Islam Dzahnibekov, Ali Osaev (Istanbul); and Umar Israilov (Vienna).Wood, Tony (14 May 2009). \\"The Murder List\\". London Review of Books. Vol. 31 No. 9 p 14. Kadyrov stated in December 2009 that he had personally helped many of the murder victims and their families and was not their enemy. \\"I don't want to kill, who did I fight? I fought terrorists. Who did I protect? I protected the whole of Russia so that people in Moscow or St. Petersburg...could live in peace. They accuse me of killing women and children. It's not true.\\" * A mutinied commander, Movladi Baisarov, said that Kadyrov \\"acts like a medieval tyrant. If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it's like signing one's own death warrant. Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. (...) Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried\\".Eurasian Secret Services Daily Review. axisglobe.com (23 October 2006) On 18 November 2006, Baisarov was killed in an ambush by members of Kadyrov's police on Moscow's Leninsky Prospekt, about two kilometres from the Kremlin. * On 13 November 2006, Human Rights Watch published a briefing paper on torture in Chechnya that it had prepared for the 37th session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture. The paper covered torture by personnel of the Second Operational Investigative Bureau (ORB-2), torture by units under the effective command of Ramzan Kadyrov, torture in secret detentions and the continuing \\"forced disappearances\\". According to HRW, torture \\"in both official and secret detention facilities is widespread and systematic in Chechnya\\". In many cases the perpetrators were so confident that there would be no consequences for their abuses that they did not even attempt to conceal their identity. Based on extensive research, HRW concluded in 2005 that forced disappearances in Chechnya are so widespread and systematic that they constitute crimes against humanity. * Anna Politkovskaya, a veteran Russian reporter (murdered in 2006; case unsolved as of ) who specialised in Chechnyan reporting, claimed that she had received a grainy video footage shot on a mobile phone of a man identical in appearance to Ramzan, saying that \\"the clips were the murders of federal servicemen by the Kadyrovites, and also kidnappings directed by Kadyrov. These are very serious things; on the basis of this evidence a criminal case and investigation should follow. This could allow this person to be brought to justice, something he has long richly deserved,\\" she said. She was allegedly working on an article revealing human rights abuses and regular incidents of torture in Chechnya at the time of her murder.

There is also no doubt in our minds that Kadyrov has personally taken part in beating and torturing people. What they are doing is pure lawlessness. To make matters worse, they also go after people who are innocent, whose names were given by someone being tortured to death. He and his henchmen spread fear and terror in Chechnya. (...)

In Tsentaroy (Khosi-Yurt), where the Kadyrovite headquarters is located, there are at least two illegal prisons functioning. One consists of concrete bunkers or pillboxes, where kidnapped relatives of armed Chechen fighters are held hostage while the second prison in Tsentaroy is evidently located in the yard‚Äîor in immediate vicinity‚Äîof the house of Ramzan Kadyrov. * The Kadyrovites are often accused of working as a death squad against Kadyrov's enemies. Ramzan is rumoured to own a private prison in his stronghold of Tsentaroy, his home village south-east of Grozny. Fields around Tsentaroy are allegedly mined and all access routes are blocked by checkpoints.

He condemned the killers, and in response to Orlov's accusations, said: \\"You are not a prosecutor or a judge therefore your claims about my guilt are not ethical, to put it mildly, and are insulting to me.

In May 2016, his house was burnt down by a group of masked men and his family was dragged out, put in a car and were thrown under a bridge. His wife also stated that they threatened the other residents with burning down their houses as well if they reported about the matter to anyone. Later, the Chechen police cordoned off his village in order to hunt him down. Kadyrov's spokesman denied these reports were true. The complainant later publicly apologised to Kadyrov and accused the media of distorting his remarks in his video complaint. He again fled to Dagestan in November 2016. According to human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina, he had to flee after Chechnya's Deputy Interior Minister Apti Alaudinov personally threatened to kill him. * After Memorial's Chechnya head Oyub Titiev was arrested in January 2018 over drug possession, Oyub's supporters claimed the charges were fake and were made-up by the Chechen authorities to suppress criticism of Kadyrov. Kadyrov called Oyub a \\"drug addict\\" while criticising those working with human rights activists and warned them off from working in his region. * On 30 January 2020, Imran Aliev, an anti-Kadyrov blogger, was murdered in a hotel in Lille. French authorities have identified the alleged killer as a hitman having connections with the Chechen leader and who had travelled with Aliev in a train from Belgium to France. Rounding up, torture and execution of gay men Kadyrov has previously encouraged extrajudicial killings of homosexual men by family members as an alternative to law enforcement ‚Äì in some cases, gay men in prison have been released early specifically to enable their murder by relatives. In April 2017, international media reported that gay men in Chechnya were being arrested, detained and tortured as part of a region-wide pogrom. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on 5 May that he would personally ask the Russian Prosecutor General and Interior Ministry to help Kremlin rights ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova check the reported abuse. UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Sir Alan Duncan told the UK Parliament he had been informed of alleged plans to eliminate Chechnya's gay community by the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which commenced on 26 May 2017. Chechnya has denied the reports, with its interior minister calling the allegations an \\"April Fools' joke\\". Kadyrov's spokesman Alvi Karimov rejected the allegations and described the report in the Russian newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, as \\"absolute lies and disinformation\\", basing his denial on the claim that \\"you cannot detain and persecute people who simply do not exist in the republic. If there were such people in Chechnya, the law-enforcement organs wouldn't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning.\\" Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that there had been no evidence found to support the allegations, adding that he had no reason to doubt Kadyrov's claims that no one under his rule has been persecuted for their sexual orientation. In an interview with HBO's Real Sports aired on 18 July, Kadyrov said that, if there are any, Chechen gays should be moved to Canada, and claimed that pro-LGBT lobbyists are devils. Sanctions On 20 December 2017, the United States imposed sanctions under the Magnitsky Act on five Russian nationals including Kadyrov, accusing him of personal involvement in repression, torture and murder. U.S. officials accused him of heading \\"an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings,\\" and that one or more of his political opponents were killed at his direction. He was added to United States Department of the Treasury's blacklist which also included a Chechen security official Ayub Kataev along with three other Russian individuals for their criminal involvement in a corruption case uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky. In response, Kadyrov mocked the sanctions on his Instagram account. \\"A sleepless night is waiting for me.\\" He further stated, \\"I can be proud that I'm out of favor with the special services of the USA,\\" and added, \\"In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America's special services.\\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the sanctions \\"illegal\\" and \\"unfriendly\\" stating, \\"We consider these sanctions illegal, we consider them unfriendly, and we do not agree with them.\\" He also stated that it was highly probable that Russia would retaliate by accusing U.S. officials or citizens of rights violations and banning them from the country. Further sanctions were added on 20 July 2020, with United States Secretary of State accusing him of increasing abuses on civilians during the COVID-19 pandemic. His immediate family were also sanctioned. The sanctions also ban him, his wife and two of his daughters from traveling to the United States. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Sputnik News Agency that they will try to impose retaliatory sanctions. Kadyrov meanwhile posted a picture of himself along with firearms, saying, \\"Pompeo, we accept the fight! What comes next will be more interesting.\\" Threats to journalists On April 13, 2020, Kadyrov threatened the journalist Elena Milashina on Instagram for her news article in Novaya Gazeta about Chechnya's coronavirus lockdown, stating it was \\"defamatory\\". He also criticized the federal authorities for not taking any action saying, \\"If you want us to commit a crime and become criminals, just say so! One [of us] will take on this responsibility and serve his time, as required by law.\\" On Telegram, he later labeled her newspaper \\"anti-Russian\\" and a \\"foreign agent\\", also claiming it stereotyped Chechens. Yelena had also covered about Chechnya's gay purges and had been allegedly attacked on February 6, 2020. She accused the Chechen authorities of orchestrating the attack. Over 100 Russian celebrities and human rights activists in response to Kadyrov's online threats, called upon the federal government to protect Yelena. Novaya Gazeta meanwhile was made to delete Elena's article article from its website by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia, which claimed it was fake news and created a threat to the lives of citizens. Peskov dismissed Kadyrov's threats as an emotional response, saying everyone was on edge due to the coronavirus pandemic. Human Rights Watch criticized Peskov's reaction, stating it was \\"like a stark green light to Chechen officials to act on their threats.\\" On April 21, 2020, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty stated that it had complained to Russian authorities after Kadyrov in an online video had threatened to punish their North Caucasus buerau chief Aslan Doukaev over an article against his government's restrictive coronavirus lockdown measures against farmers. The ambassador of United States to Russia John J. Sullivan condemned Kadyrov's threats against Milashina and Aslan Doukaev, stating freedom of press was a pillar of democracy. French Human Rights Ambassador-at- Large Fran√ßois Croquette and the German Commissioner for Human Rights Policy B√§rbel Kofler in a joint statement called Kadyrov's threats against Milashina unacceptable and urged Russia to investigate. The State Security Service of Georgia announced arrest of a Russian citizen on July 15 for an assassination attempt on Giorgi Gabunia, who had insulted Putin in past. Georgian media and Gabunia's boss later claimed the assassin was sent by Kadyrov, who denied the allegations and said that if he had sent someone to kill, they would succeed. Kadyrov called Gabunia his enemy and said that he should beg for forgiveness by getting down on his knees, otherwise he would continue to remain one. Georgian authorities have not confirmed or denied the allegations against Kadyrov. Social media Networks The number of subscribers to Kadyrov's social networks in 2016 was more than three million people, including three million followers of his Instagram account, according to the Chechen leader's press service. It said that he had 500,000 followers on the Russian VK social network, 760,860 on Facebook, 331,000 on Twitter and 5,447 on LiveJournal. Besides his Instagram postings, it was said that he had also made almost 5,000 on Twitter and 2,300 on VK.

WhatsApp lecture In May 2015, Kadyrov gave a stern televised lecture to a group of Chechen men and women who were accused of using the WhatsApp messaging service to comment on the impending marriage of local police chief to a teenage girl some three decades younger than him. The wedding had been widely discussed across Russia on reports that the young woman, Kheda Goylabiyeva, was being coerced into marriage with the chief, Nazhud Guchigov. \\"Behave like Chechens\\", Kadyrov was reported as telling the assemblage of about a dozen people standing in the marbled courtyard of a building that seemed to be his government palace. \\"Honor of the family is the most important thing. Don't write such things any more. You, men, keep your women away from WhatsApp.\\" In its coverage of the incident, The New York Times reported: > \\"Lock them in, do not let them go out, and they will not post anything\\", Mr. > Kadyrov said in a video to a sheepish group of men and women who kept their > arms folded across their chests and their eyes firmly on the ground during > the harangue.MacFarquhar, Neil (May 20, 2015) \\"Chechen Leader's Advice on > Women: Lock Them In\\". The New York Times In December 2015, a female Chechen social worker criticised Kadyrov in an audio message posted on WhatsApp, after her boss tried to force her to put aside some money as collateral for her next month's payment. Three days after posting the message, she appeared on Grozny TV along with her husband, where she was publicly berated by Kadyrov as well as parliament speaker Magomed Daudov, presidential administration head Islam Kadyrov and her boss. The couple apologised on live television for her message. John Oliver In May 2016, Kadyrov engaged in a brief Instagram dispute with comedian John Oliver. He had posted a message on Instagram asking for help in finding his cat, which had gone astray. The posting led Oliver to make a five-minute segment on HBO's Last Week Tonight dealing with the cat's disappearance and, according to The Guardian, Kadyrov's penchant for posting of, for example, \\"regular videos of his work-outs in the gym,\\" also on Instagram. As well, Oliver teased Kadyrov \\"for his propensity\\" to wear T-shirts bearing the image of Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the show, Oliver posted a photo of himself holding a cat, captioned \\"@RKadyrov Is this your cat?\\"Walker, Shaun (24 May 2016) \\"Fur Flies as Chechen Leader and Comedian John Oliver Clash Over Lost Cat\\".

The New York Times Account suspensions Kadyrov stated that he found his Russian-language Instagram and Facebook accounts were not working on December 23, 2017, and he never received a response from Instagram after sending a request for service support. His English-language Instagram account remained unaffected however. Kadyrov accused them of bowing to pressure from United States after he was sanctioned. He wrote on Telegram in response, \\"Instagram's move, which still wants to pretend it is independent from officials of Washington is weird.\\" He added, \\"They wanted to stir my indignation, but were wrong, and this is the only thing which pleases me in actions Instagram and their patrons in the White House are undertaking. I have planned already to quit the network. But I thought I could fail my friends and subscribers, as on Instagram and Facebook I have more than 4 million followers.\\" The Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin stated that the decision by Facebook and Instagram to suspend Kadyrov's accounts violated his rights, stating, \\"They are afraid of a public conversation and the truth. Such decision cannot be explained in another way‚Ä¶ The thing is that to read bloggers in social networks one needs to be their subscribers. By deleting an account, they deprive citizens of their right to know about bloggers‚Äô opinion and to communicate with them.\\" Russia's telecommunications overseer Roskomnadzor on 26 December asked Facebook to explain why they had suspended his accounts. Facebook issued a statement on 28 December that it did so after he was sanctioned by United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control as these came under trade sanctions.  Other issues   Sauna video  On 12 March 2006, a Chechen separatist website posted a short video shot on a mobile phone of a party in a sauna involving two alleged prostitutes and several men, including one who looked and sounded like Ramzan Kadyrov, seen dancing with a young, half-naked woman and trying to rip her bra off. Another man then starts masturbating in front of them.

The leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, immediately called for the Government of Australia to quarantine the prize money until assurances are received as to how the money will be used. Concerns had been previously raised that the Melbourne Cup could be used to launder money by overseas individuals.  Honor killings  In 2009, Kadyrov stated his approval of honor killings of seven women, based on the belief that they were engaging in adultery. In an interview with David Scott of HBO, he condoned honor killings of homosexuals in July 2017 stating, \\"If we have [gay] people here, I'm telling you officially their relatives won't let them be because of our faith, our mentality, customs, traditions. Even if it's punishable under the law, we would still condone it.\\"  Wikileaks  On 28 November 2010, a classified Wikileaks cable named Kadyrov as a \\"starring guest\\" at some of Dagestan's most elaborate weddings, which indicates the political \\"Caucasus power structure\\" in these weddings. In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia's Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime \\"water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea\\", and a report that Ramzan Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a \\"five-kilo lump of gold\\".  Charlie Hebdo cartoons  In January 2015, Kadyrov said he would organize protests if a Russian newspaper published the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, saying \\"we will not allow anyone to insult the Prophet [Muhammad], even if it will cost us our lives.\\" He also stated that Alexei Venediktov \\"will be brought to account\\" after his radio station Ekho Moskvy took a survey of readers on whether to publish the cartoons. Venediktov stated he would ask the authorities to intervene against Kadyrov's threats. During a protest rally against the cartoons attended by hundreds of thousands of people in Chechnya, he accused those backing Charlie Hebdo of using \\"false slogans about free speech and democracy\\".  Support for polygamy  Kadyrov supports polygamy in Muslim-majority republics in Russia, and believes that Muslims who speak out against the practice are not true adherents to their faith. According to Kadyrov, men legally marrying more than one wife would be more honest than having many mistresses, and would resolve Russia's demographic problem. In April 2018, he stated that all Muslim men are permitted by Allah to have four wives but discouraged having the marriages officially registered. He also denied reports that polygamy would be legalised in Chechnya.  Boston Marathon bombing  After the Boston Marathon bombing, Kadyrov expressed sadness for the victims but denied the suspects had any ties to his region in a statement on his Instagram. He suggested that the suspects were products of American upbringing. Kadyrov accused the CIA of framing Dzokhar Tsarnaev on 18 March 2015, after he was handed a death sentence for the Boston Marathon Bombing and said that they could not have conducted the bombing without CIA's knowledge.  Threats to opposition politicians  On 31 January 2016, Kadyrov posted a video of Russian opposition politicians Mikhail Kasyanov and Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza in the crosshairs of a gun on his Instagram blog. In a few days, after multiple complaints, Instagram removed the video prompting Kadyrov to criticize the decision: \\"This is the much-boasted freedom of speech in America! You can write anything but cannot touch those American dogs, those friends of the Congress and the State Department\\". Report by Ilya Yashin Russian opposition leader Ilya Yashin authored a report against Kadyrov released on 23 February 2016 during a press conference which was repeatedly interrupted by police and hecklers. He also claimed that Kadyrov had murdered Boris Nemtsov. The report titled A National Security Threat claimed that Kadyrov poses a threat to Russia. It included allegations of corruption, authoritarian rule, secret prisons, rigging votes in favour of Vladimir Putin, stealing from the country's national budget to enrich himself, enforcing Sharia law over Russian law, his lavish lifestyle, building and maintaining a personal army of about 30,000 fighters, purported ties to organised crime figures, and his involvement in politically motivated murders of journalists, human rights activists and political opponents. The report also contained 20 questions which Yashin had invited Kadyrov to answer but was refused. Kadyrov dismissed the report calling it \\"nothing but idle chatter\\" and posted it on his social network accounts before its release. His spokesman filed a request with the Russian Prosecutor General and the Investigative Committee for Yashin to be arrested for the report saying it contained slander and insults against Kadyrov. Grozny fatwa A conference of Islamic scholars funded by the Tabah foundation in the United Arab Emirates, was convened by Kadyrov in Grozny in late August 2016. The conference was attended by notable Islamic scholars including the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed el- Tayeb; Grand Mufti of Egypt, Shawki Allam; ex-Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa, Usama al-Azhari who is the religious adviser to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; Habib Ali al-Jifri and the mufti of Damascus Abdul Fattah al- Bizm. The conference was convened to discuss the alleged abuse of Islamic ideas to propagate extremism and to establish the criteria for determining who are the true followers of the Sunnah. The assembly of scholars issued a fatwa which declared that those who abide by the Kalam, belong to the four madhhabs and follow the path of moral self-perfection espoused by distinguished Islamic teachers, primarily the Sufi sheikhs, were the only true believers. The fatwa called the sect of Salafism as a \\"dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect\\", along with the extremist groups like Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Habashis. The conference also issued two further documents. In the first one, it appealed to President Vladimir Putin to ban Salafism and term any condemnation of \\"traditional Islam\\" as \\"extremism\\". It also proposed the fatwa be regarded as the considered opinion of \\"leading Russian experts\\" when evaluating the activity of Muslim organizations and the preaching of individual clerics. The second one issued a resolution calling for the establishment of a Council for Islamic Education and also a Council of Ulema, which would rule on who is and is not a true follower of Sunni Islam. The ruling created a controversy, with both Islamic theologians and secular commentators condemning it, with some seeing it as a bid by Kadyrov to divide Russian Muslims into those who accept the importance he places on teachings of the Sufi brotherhoods as well as probably also what he considers as \\"traditional Islam\\" without question, and those who don't with \\"erroneous\\" views. Many of the key participants also disavowed the resolutions. Mukkadas Bibarsov, mufti of Saratov Oblast stated that the question of who was a true follower of Sunni Islam was resolved \\"centuries ago\\". He also added that the fatwa failed to take into account the crucial differences between Russia's Muslims, specifically that some Muslim communities did not follow Sufism. Liz Fuller writing for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty commented that the fatwa seemed to be giving permission to Kadyrov to take any action he likes to punish those whose religious views don't match with his own. Yaroslav Trofimov writing for The Wall Street Journal described it as a \\"new fracture emerging within Islam\\". Many Saudi clerics and citizens expressed outrage at the fatwa on social media. The Muslim Brotherhood expressed \\"deep sorrow\\" over the fatwa, stating that it ‚Äúignited fires of discord among Muslims around the world.‚Äù  Threats to Russian police officers  In 2015, Kadyrov ordered Chechen security forces to ‚Äúshoot to kill‚Äù if they encountered police officers from other parts of Russia on the territory of the Chechen Republic.\\"Kadyrov Authorizes His Police to Shoot Officers From Other Parts of Russia\\".

Mixed martial arts tournament involving child fighters A mixed martial arts tournament involving children was held as an \\"exhibition fight\\" on 4 October during the Grand Prix Akhmat 2016 in Grozny and broadcast on Match TV. Three of Kadyrov's sons, all of them aged under 12, fought in the tournament with Kadyrov sitting in the audience and none of the fighters wearing any protective gear. One of the fights ended with a technical knockout. Kadyrov also posted images of the bouts on his Instagram account. The event caused an outcry especially against Ramzan allowing his children to compete in the tournament. Fedor Emelianenko, the president of Russian MMA Union, criticised the event as \\"inexcusable\\", stating that rules stipulate fighters under the age of 21 have to wear protective gear while children under the age of 12 are not allowed to compete. Vadim Finkelstein, the head of MMA promotion M-1 Global also backed Fedor's comments. Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for President Putin, stated that the fact that one of the fights between the children finished with a technical knockout was ‚Äúa reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to inquire about this incident.‚Äù Deputy Minister of Sports Pavel Kolobkov stated that participation of children under the age of 12 in MMA competitions was illegal while stating that the incident was being investigated. Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also stated that the event will be investigated. MMA fighter Jeff Monson however backed the organisers stating that there was nothing wrong with it. Several Chechen officials responded to Fedor's criticism with insults and accusations including Timur Dugazayev, general director of Akhmat MMA promotion, Member of Parliament Adam Delimkhanov as well as Kadyrov himself. The Ministry of Sports found on 18 October that Kadyrov's promotion had violated regulations. It also found that the event was actually an unlicensed show with no regulatory oversight. The promotion was directed to coordinate with the Ministry of Sports and other regulatory bodies to ‚Äúprevent such irregularities in conduct‚Äù and handed a letter detailing its failure to comply with the legislation. Comments about gays, Russia's nuclear arsenal and tensions with the United States In an interview with HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel in July 2017, Kadyrov denied that there had been anti-gay purges in Chechnya, while claiming that there were no gay men in Chechnya. He further stated that if there were any, they should be sent to Canada. He also said that gay people were \\"not human\\". Kadyrov also commented about Russia's nuclear arsenal and tensions between the United States and Russia. He said that \\"America is not really a strong enough state for us to regard it as an enemy of Russia, we have a strong government and are a nuclear state.\\" He also added, \\"Even if our government was completely destroyed, our nuclear missiles would be automatically deployed. We will put the whole world on its knees and screw it from behind.\\" Threats to netizens insulting someone's honor In June 2019, Ramzan in an Instagram video told residents of Dagestan to not insult Chechnya or Chechens online amidst controversy over a piece of land of the republic being labeled as belonging to Chechnya, threatening to torture whoever insulted the honor of Chechens. He also warned the people to remove any such comments, otherwise they will have to answer to the Chechen law enforcement agencies. Kadyrov during a government function organized for medium and small-scale businesses in November 2019, called for online users insulting someone's honor to be killed, arrested or intimidated per a BBC Russian Service translation. He stated in the same speech that he didn't call for targeting law-abiding citizens, but the others were \\"crooks, traitors, tattletales and schizophrenics of all stripes.\\" Kadyrov's spokesman Alvi Karimov denied the accuracy of BBC's translation, however Meduza's translation found that it painted an accurate picture. The speech was broadcast on a state-owned TV channel. Dmitry Peskov stated that his remarks won't be investigated by the Russian government as it was the job of the police.  Personal life  The opening of the Moscow Cathedral Mosque in September 2015 The New Yorker says that over the years Kadyrov has tried out various personalities: \\"the merciless warrior in fatigues who leads special operations to kill anti-government rebels; the jolly Caucasus baron who spars with Mike Tyson and shows off his private zoo; the family man and observant Muslim who has banned alcohol, ordered that women wear head scarves in public buildings, and boasts that his six-year-old son has memorized the Koran.\\" He enjoys boxing and once met with former heavyweight-boxing champion Mike Tyson. In 1996, Kadyrov married Medni Musaevna Kadyrova. The couple are parents of twelve children. His sons Adam and Eli have earned the title of hafiz while his daughters Aishat, Khadizhat and Khutmat have earned the title of hafiza. Khutmat and another daughter Ashura have performed together with the nasheed singer Mishary Rashid Alafasy. Khadizhat was recognised as the most gifted student in Chechnya in 2016 and qualified for participation in pan-Russian contest \\"Student of the Year 2016\\" on 20 February 2016. Medni launched her fashion line called \\"Firdaws\\" in March 2012 in Dubai. Aishat too presented her own fashion collection in March 2017 and has also taken over her mother's fashion enterprise Firdaws. Today, Aishat is the president of the Firdaws fashion house. Kadyrov is a noted collector of sports cars. He owns a Lamborghini Revent√≥n, one of only 20 made. He is also known for his extensive collection of Chechen daggers. On 5 October 2011, he celebrated his 35th birthday in a lavish fashion in the presence of several Hollywood stars, including actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and actress Hilary Swank as well as British violinist Vanessa-Mae, singer Seal and many others. When journalist Marianna Makismovskaya asked him where the money for the live-televised celebration were coming from, he reportedly laughed and said \\"Allah gives it to us\\", before adding: \\"I don't know, it comes from somewhere\\"  See also  *Natalya Estemirova *Politics of Chechnya *Akhmad Kadyrov *Kadyrovtsy *Second Chechen War *FC Akhmat Grozny  References   External links  * Official website * Category:Living people Category:1976 births Category:Chechen warlords Category:Chechen Islamists Category:Deputy prime ministers of Chechnya Category:Russian football chairmen and investors Category:Heroes of the Russian Federation Category:Recipients of the Order of Courage Category:People of the Chechen wars Category:Presidents of Chechnya Category:People from Grozny Category:People sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act Category:Russian Muslims Category:Prime Ministers of Chechnya Category:Russian military personnel Category:Russian Sunni Muslims Category:United Russia politicians Category:21st-century Russian politicians Category:Heads of the federal subjects of Russia Category:Russian Islamists Category:Russian people of Chechen descent Category:Racehorse owners and breeders Category:Honorary Members of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences Category:Chechen people Category:FC Akhmat Grozny Category:Qadiri order Category:Recipients of the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\", 4th class ","title":"Ramzan Kadyrov"},{"id":"647886","text":"The Cave Clan is a primarily Australian group dedicated to urban exploration. History The Cave Clan was founded on 26 January (Australia Day), 1986 by three Melbourne teenagers, Woody, Dougo and Sloth. The trio had started exploring together during the summer of 1985‚Äì1986. Alfred Saddlier, a worker for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW), is often cited as an inspiration to the Cave Clan's founders. During construction on Melbourne‚Äôs drains in the 1940s and 1950s, Saddlier would leave his name and the date in tar paint before the last section of tunnel was put in place. After Saddlier was mentioned in an article in Melbourne‚Äôs The Herald Sun his sister wrote to the Cave Clan explaining that her brother was in fact a \\"builder of drains\\", and not an explorer. Membership and activities Cave Clan members explore natural or artificial tunnels and caves, along with rooftops and abandoned buildings.

Amongst other things, members are attracted by the appeal of entering locations that the public rarely sees. Safety issues The Cave Clan does not advocate entering drains when it is raining, exploring alone, or removing a manhole from beneath if the above location is unknown. This is due to the potential hazard of the exit being on a road and thus has the risk of being struck by a vehicle. The golden rule of the Cave Clan is, \\"When it rains, no drains!\\". Controversy A modern compass themed Cave Clan logo. As with urban exploration-related topics, by entering into locations or drains without permission, the members of the Cave Clan can be described as \\"recreational trespassers\\". In 2005 it was revealed that the NSW State Government had asked for the Cave Clan's help in finding tunnels that could become terrorist targets.Cave Clan's Fortress, \\"Cave Clan's Fortress ‚Äì smh.com.au\\", Retrieved on 7 April 2008. Coroner Hugh Dillon investigating the death of two graffiti artists in a Sydney stormwater drain in 2008 has recommended police investigate a group known as the Sydney Cave Clan. Delivering his findings into the deaths, Dillon said he was concerned about the counter-cultural message by the group, which he said consisted of \\"shadowy characters\\". Dillon said he would recommend to police that they investigate the group and shut the website down after it was revealed that it publicised the drain and encouraged risk-taking activity. Malinowsky, the sole survivor of the trio, alleged at the inquest that he was encouraged by a website from the so-called \\"Cave Clan\\"--a group which he alleged dared people to explore urban underground spaces. Graffiti A cave clan tag left underground in the Hobart Rivulet The Cave Clan has long officially distanced itself from graffiti, despite the historical practice of discreet tagging as a historical documentation practice. Drain tagging is discouraged, especially in historically significant areas; there are clear examples, however, of the Cave Clan name, logo and other specific material related to the Cave Clan and/or their members, being used in graffiti, by unknown sources.

He is a full professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Ariel University and former Science and Technology Adviser to the Prime Minister of Israel (1996‚Äì1999). He is founder of Israel Science and Technology Directory.Israel Science and Technology Directory. Israel Science and Technology Directory: About page Education Elementary and High School education Israel Hanukoglu attended :tr:≈ûi≈üli Terakki Lisesi in Istanbul until the end of the Junior High School. In ninth grade, he switched to Atat√ºrk Erkek Lisesi in Taksim, Istanbul, graduating in 1969. In his senior year, he was selected as a student for the American Field Service (AFS). As an AFS student, he attended Joseph A. Craig High School in Janesville, Wisconsin, and received his high-school diploma in 1970.Israel Hanukoglu. Curriculum Vitae College education Israel Hanukoglu received his undergraduate degree cum laude with double majors in biology and psychology and a minor in political science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He then went to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for graduate studies and received his M.Sc. degree in 1976 in an inter-disciplinary Endocrinology-Reproductive physiology program, under the joint supervision of Prof. Harry J. Karavolas (Dept. of Physiological Chemistry) and Prof. Robert W. Goy (Dept. of Psychology). His Ph.D. thesis research on the \\"Mechanism of electron transport to cytochrome P-450 in adrenal cortex mitochondrial steroid monooxygenase systems\\" was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Colin R. Jefcoate. He received his Ph.D. diploma in August 1980. Contributions to science Prof. Hanukoglu's scientific work concentrated in three different areas outlined below. Structures of keratins Hanukoglu's career in molecular biology started at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Chicago (1980-1983 with Elaine Fuchs), where he cloned and sequenced cDNAs coding for cytoskeletal proteins, actin and alpha keratins. He elucidated the first structures of cytoskeletal keratin families, and predicted the long helical domains of these proteins. By computerized analysis of amino acid sequences he predicted that the central rod domain of intermediate filament proteins is composed of four helical segments separated by three short linker sequences. Later crystallographic studies have confirmed this as a general model for intermediate filament protein structure. Steroid hormone synthesis During his Ph.D. thesis research, Israel isolated the mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones in all steroidogenic tissues, including the adrenal cortex, and the reproductive organs. The first step of steroidogenesis is dependent on the transfer of electrons from NADPH to a P450 type enzyme (P450scc) via an electron-transfer chain that includes two additional proteins. These proteins are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Israel reconstituted this system using proteins he purified, characterized the process of electron transfer between the proteins, and built a kinetic model that simulated precisely the dynamic behavior of this complex system. In his first academic position at the Department of Biology at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, he first determined the molar stoichiometry of the mitochondrial P450 system proteins using specific antibodies that he generated. He then set out to clone the cDNAs and the genes that code for these enzymes. His lab was the first to clone the cDNAs and the gene coding for adrenodoxin reductase - the first enzyme in the electron transfer chain of the mitochondrial P450 system. By sequence and structural analyses of adrenodoxin reductase, Israel identified its binding sites for the electron donor and acceptor coenzymes, NADPH and FAD. By sequence analyses of the large oxidoreductase type of enzyme families, he noted that the FAD-binding site is a classical Rossmann fold, but the NADPH binding site has a different consensus sequence that could be responsible for NAD vs. NADP coenzyme specificity. The importance of the motifs he identified was confirmed by re-engineering of coenzyme specificities of different enzymes. Elucidation of the crystal structure of adrenodoxin reductase further verified Israel's identification of the coenzyme binding sites. Analysis of the phylogeny of this enzyme in eukaryotes showed that the NADP binding site sequence is strictly conserved. As the steroidogenic tissues have very high levels of antioxidants, Israel suspected that the P450 systems may leak electrons producing oxygen radicals. He examined this issue and showed that indeed, electrons that leak during the action mitochondrial P450 systems generate reactive oxygen species. His studies also showed that in bovine ovary, levels of antioxidants are coordinately regulated with steroidogenesis. His other work in this field includes elucidation of the mechanism of action of corticotropin (ACTH) in regulating steroid hormone synthesis in the adrenal cortex, regulation of adrenal steroidogenic capacity in disease states, and the cloning and elucidation of the structure of ACTH receptor. In this field, Israel organized the first International Symposium in Molecular Steroidogenesis in Jerusalem in 1991 which served as the cornerstone for a continuing series of international symposia for scientists who specialize in this field. Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) In his clinical work as an endocrinologist, Israel's older brother, Prof. Aaron Hanukoglu (Tel Aviv University, Sackler Medical School and E. Wolfson Medical Center), identified that a hereditary disease named pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I encompasses two independent syndromes. Following this discovery the two brothers continued their collaboration to understand the molecular basis of the severe form of PHA. By their collaborative work that also included additional labs, the Hanukoglu brothers discovered that the severe forms of pseudohypoaldosteronism type I result from mutations in three genes (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1B) that encode for protein subunits of the Epithelial sodium (Na+) channel (ENaC). These studies also helped establish that ENaC is the principal channel involved in blood volume and blood pressure regulation in humans. Following these studies, the Hanukoglu brothers directed their attention to understand the structure and function of ENaC assembled from normal and mutated subunits. Their analyses showed that the phenotypic variations in the severity of pseudohypoaldosteronism are associated with the types of genetic mutations. Their work on the structure of ENaC subunits led to the identification of charged residues and regions responsible for transport of the protein to membrane and for regulation of extracellular Na+ ions. In an extensive review of studies on ASIC and ENaC, Prof. Hanukoglu has summarized the major similarities between ASIC and ENaC type channels. To define the sites of localization of ENaC in tissues and within cells, Hanukoglu's laboratory generated polyclonal antibodies against extracellular ENaC subunits. These antibodies for the first time permitted visualization of intracellular localization of ENaC at high resolution and led to the discovery that in all cells with motile cilia ENaC is located on cilia. These studies establish that ENaC is an important regulator of fluid level in the luminal side of cells with motile cilia in the female reproductive and respiratory tract. More recently, they showed that these sodium channels are also located in the seminiferous tubules in the testis and in the tail and head region of sperm. Systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism patients with mutated ENaC subunits may lose significant amount salt in sweat especially at hot climates. To identify the sites of salt loss, Hanukoglu brothers examined the localization of ENaC in the human skin. In a comprehensive study examining all the layers of skin and epidermal appendages, they found a widespread distribution of ENaC in keratinocytes in the epidermal layers. Yet, in the eccrine sweat glands, ENaC was localized on the apical cell membrane exposed to the duct of these sweat glands. Based on additional observations, they concluded that the ENaC located on the eccrine gland sweat ducts is responsible for the uptake of Na+ ions from sweat secretions. This recycling of Na+ reduces the concentration of salt in perspiration and prevents the loss of salt at hot climates via perspiration.

As the Moon covers the Sun during a solar eclipse, the rugged topography of the lunar limb allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some places while not in others. The effect is named after Francis Baily, who explained the phenomenon in 1836. The diamond ring effect is seen when only one bead is left, appearing as a shining \\"diamond\\" set in a bright ring around the lunar silhouette. Lunar topography has considerable relief because of the presence of mountains, craters, valleys, and other topographical features. The irregularities of the lunar limb profile (the \\"edge\\" of the Moon, as seen from a distance) are known accurately from observations of grazing occultations of stars. Astronomers thus have a fairly good idea which mountains and valleys will cause the beads to appear in advance of the eclipse. While Baily's beads are seen briefly for a few seconds at the center of the eclipse path, their duration is maximized near the edges of the path of the umbra, lasting 1‚Äì2 minutes. After the diamond ring effect has diminished, the subsequent Baily's beads effect and totality phase are safe to view without the solar filters used during the partial phases. By then, less than 0.001% of the Sun's photosphere is visible. Observers in the path of totality of a solar eclipse see first a gradual covering of the Sun by the lunar silhouette for just a small duration of time from around one minute to four minutes, followed by the diamond ring effect (visible without filters) as the last bit of photosphere disappears. As the burst of light from the ring fades, Bailey's beads appear as the last bits of the bright photosphere shine through valleys aligned at the edge of the Moon.Pasachoff, J. M. & Covington, M. The Cambridge Eclipse Photography Guide (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993) As the Baily's beads disappear behind the advancing lunar edge (the beads also reappear at the end of totality), a thin reddish edge called the chromosphere (the Greek chr≈çma meaning \\"color\\") appears. Though the reddish hydrogen radiation is most visible to the unaided eye, the chromosphere also emits thousands of additional spectral lines. Observational history Although Baily is often said to have discovered the cause of the feature which bears his name, Sir Edmond Halley made the first recorded observations of Baily's beads during the solar eclipse of 3 May 1715.Great Britain did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752, so at the time of the eclipse, the date was recorded as 22 April 1715. Halley described and correctly ascertained the cause of the effect in his \\"Observations of the late Total Eclipse of the Sun[...]\\" in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: In media Cosmas Damian Asam was probably the earliest realistic painter to depict a total solar eclipse and diamond ring. His painting was finished in 1735. The Baily's beads phenomenon is seen during the credit opening sequence of the NBC TV show Heroes, while the Diamond Ring effect is seen during the credit opening sequence of Star Trek: Voyager, albeit from a fictitious extrasolar body, seen from space.

According to his biographer:McVaugh 1956:vii. He collected specimens in the southwestern United States, Florida, Mexico (including Baja California), and South America. He had about 200 species and two genera (Palmerella and Malperia) of plants named in his honor. The standard author abbreviation Palmer is applied to botanical taxa he described. Palmer's botanical collections (numbering over 100,000) are mostly pressed and dried and reside at research institutions around the world. These institutions include the Smithsonian Institution, Harvard University, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the U.S. National Arboretum, the New York Botanical Garden, Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, and many others. The Palmer botanical collection in the U.S. National Herbarium at the Smithsonian Institution remains the largest, containing over 16,000 specimens collected over sixty years.Edward Palmer Collection, Department of Botany, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution He wrote a report, Food Products of the North American Indians (1871), which was one of the pioneering works in ethnobotany. He collected specimens of 24 of the 61 plant species described, with their uses, in the report. Though primarily a botanist, Edward Palmer also contributed to early American archaeology and ethnology. Between 1882 and 1884, Palmer worked as a field assistant for the Bureau of American Ethnology Mound Exploration Division. The purpose of this expedition was to conduct an extensive survey of Indian mounds in the eastern United States. While most of Palmer's archaeological research was performed in Arkansas, he also excavated mounds in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia. While in Georgia, Palmer investigated the Kolomoki Mound site in Early County. Though he excavated many of the mounds at Kolomoki, he is said to have discovered nothing worth cataloguing. However, he examined many \\"house sites\\" and found a number of ash deposits and fragments of pottery. In 1894, the Mound Exploration Division final report, written by its director Cyrus Thomas, was published and dispelled the racist theories that the mounds of the southeastern United States had been built by a \\"lost race of Mound-Builders.\\" The report cited ample evidence that the mounds were built by the ancestors of historical Native tribes.

The battle was waged in both Gordon and Whitfield counties, Georgia, May 13‚Äì15, 1864. It ended inconclusively with the Confederate Army retreating. The engagement was fought between the Military Division of the Mississippi (led by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman) on the side of the Union and the Army of Tennessee (Gen. Joseph E. Johnston) for the Confederates. Background thumbright305pxSherman's Atlanta Campaign Confederate earthworks overlooking the battlefield at Resaca, 1864. In early May 1864, the Confederate government granted Johnston's request for reinforcements to his camps around Dalton, Georgia. As the brigade of Brig. Gen. James Cantey started to move through the city on May 7, cavalry scouts alerted Johnston that a large number of Union troops were moving towards Rome, Georgia, on roads that led through Resaca. During the remainder of May 7 and the day of May 8 Cantey's brigade had time to entrench and set up defenses. On May 9, the Army of the Tennessee under the command of James B. McPherson moved out of Snake Creek Gap and immediately ran into a Confederate cavalry brigade ordered to scout the area the day before under the command of Colonel Warren Grigsby. After a fierce battle, Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Sweeny formed a defensive line and drove the Confederates back to Resaca, several miles to the east. Sherman's plan, as written in his memoirs, was to hold the railroad and telegraph lines south of Dalton so that Johnston would either evacuate his position at Dalton or detach a section of his army to fight Sherman on a ground that had more of an advantage to Sherman. He devoted the Army of the Tennessee for this, while the Army of the Cumberland and the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gens. George H. Thomas and John M. Schofield, respectively, would feign attacks in the Confederates's front. As McPherson's two Corps left the woods, they skirmished with Confederate cavalry for a while until the cavalry was able to withdraw to a line of fortifications on the outer edge of the city, where they were reinforced by the 37th Mississippi, a regiment in James Cantey's brigade. In the evening, McPherson sent his only cavalry, the 9th Illinois Mounted Infantry, northeast to scout out the best route to the Western & Atlantic Railroad. Meanwhile, skirmishers in Maj. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge's XVI Corps moved to attack a line of fortifications along Camp Creek, held by Confederate cavalry, the remainders of Cantey's Division, two batteries (eight cannons) of Confederate-manufactured 12-pound Napoleon guns and a fresh brigade under Confederate Brig.

Johnston had withdrawn his forces from Rocky Face Ridge to the hills around Resaca. On May 13, the Union troops tested the Confederate lines to pinpoint their whereabouts. The next day full- scale fighting occurred, and the Union troops were generally repulsed except on the Confederate right flank where Sherman did not fully exploit his advantage. On May 15, the battle continued with no advantage to either side until Sherman sent a force across the Oostanaula River, at Lay's Ferry, using newly delivered Cumberland pontoon bridges and advanced towards Johnston's railroad supply line. Unable to halt this Union turning movement, Johnston was forced to retire. Aftermath Unable to halt the Union turning movement caused by Sherman's crossing of the Oostanaula, Johnston was forced to retire, burning the railroad span and a nearby wagon bridge in the early morning of May 16.Battle of Resaca, Ga., May 14-15, 1864. darrellryan.homestead.com After the Union repaired the bridges and transported more men over, they continued in the pursuit of the Confederates, leading to the Battle of Adairsville on May 17.

It is named in honor of Isabella I of Castile. Isabela is spread over 13 barrios and Isabela Pueblo, which is the downtown area and administrative center. It is a principal part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti√°n Metropolitan Statistical Area. Nicknames The town is known as the \\"Jard√≠n del Noroeste\\", the \\"Garden of the Northwest\\", because of the many wild flowers in its landscape. It is also known as \\"El Pueblo de los Quesitos de Hoja\\", the \\"Town of Leaf Cheeses,\\" for its production of a typical fresh white cheese wrapped in banana plant leaves, reputed to be the best. It is also known as la Ciudad de los Gallitos or the \\"City of the Fighting Cocks.\\" Since the 18th century, cock fighting was very common throughout the island, and the town became famous and well known for the quality of its fighting cocks and special breeding and training techniques used by its people.  History   Foundation  The chief Mabodamaca, one of the most important chieftains of the Island of Borinquen (name for the island of Puerto Rico) during the first decades of the 16th century, ruled the region of the 'Guajataca' (Ta√≠no name for the northwestern region of Puerto Rico) where Isabela was founded. Although the actual date of the origins of the first Spanish settlement is not precisely known, a small settlement/hermitage is known to have existed by the end of the 17th century or beginning of the 18th century in a great extension of land into what encompass today the municipalities of Isabela, Camuy and Quebradillas. The settlement was bordered to the east with the shoreline of the Guajataca River and was located on the grounds of an earlier Ta√≠no settlement. Around 1725, Jos√© Antonio de Mendiz√°bal y Azares, Governor of the Island of Puerto Rico granted authorization to base a population on the existing hermitage/village. Its given name, San Antonio de La Tuna, derives from the avocation of the Spanish settlers to the saint San Antonio de Padua and in honor of a wild cactus growing in the region (Tuna is the Spanish name for cactus). At the end of the 18th century San Antonio de la Tuna had a church, more than sixty houses, and almost 1,200 inhabitants, which was a considerable population for those times.  Relocation  Prompted by economic and health factors, the decision to relocate the hermitage to a more favorable location was pursued. Around 1818, the village obtained authorization from then Governor Salvador Mel√©ndez to transfer the population to a new location closer to the coast. Mel√©ndez approved the transfer request and a new town was founded the following year on May 21, 1819. In the same year the construction of the church began, and was finished in 1824. In 1918 the church was damaged during a strong earthquake that affected the western region of the island, it was rebuilt soon after. Hurricane Maria In September 2017 thousands of people were evacuated from their homes in Isabela when Hurricane Maria caused structural damage to the nearby Guajataca Reservoir.  Demographics  According to the 2010 Census, there were 45,631 people in the city. This represents an increase of more than 1,000 from the 2000 Census.Poblaci√≥n de Puerto Rico por Municipios, 2000 y 2010 on Elections Puerto Rico The population density was . There were 21,267 housing units. 23.8% of residents were under the age of 18 and 14.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender make up was 48.7% male and 51.3% female. As a whole, Puerto Rico is populated mainly by people from a Creole (born on the Island of European descent) or Spanish and European descent, with small groups of African and Asian people. Statistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 83.6% of Aguadillanos have Spanish or white origin, 5.0% are black, 0.2% are Amerindian, 0.2% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 8.2% were Some other race, 2.8% Two or more races.  Geography  Isabela is a hybrid town of sorts, with the rarity of being a coastline city that has beaches but is also known for its mountains (with peaks of over above sea level), rivers (surface and submarine), lakes, caves (surface and submarine), cliffs, coastal flats and forests (Tropical and Mangroves). Geographically, the municipality of Isabela belongs to the Northern Coastal Plains. Running through the south, the Aymam√≥n mountains, a prolongation of the Jaicoa Mountain Range that begins in the neighboring town of Aguadilla, boasts peaks of over above sea level. The most prominent hills that are part of these mountains are La Bandera (Galateo Alto ward) at 1,207 ft (368 m); La Silla (Arenales Alto ward) at 1,106 ft (337 m); El Sombrero (in Galateo Alto) at 1,083 feet (330 m); Indio (Planas ward) at 1,017 feet (310 m); and Monte Encantado (in Arenales Altos) at 919 feet (280 m) of elevation above sea level. The central part of the territory consists mostly of flatlands, the mountains do not surpass 656 feet (200 m) in height and the coastline flats (Bajuras) are slightly above sea level.  Barrios  Subdivisions of Isabela. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Isabela is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as . # Arenales Altos # Arenales Bajos # Bajura # Bejucos # Coto # Galateo Alto # Galateo Bajo # Guayabos # Guerrero # Isabela barrio-pueblo # Jobos # Llanadas # Mora # Planas Sectors Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci√≥n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. Special Communities Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Isabela: Cerro del Sombrero in Arenales Alto, Pueblo Nuevo in Arenales Bajos, Barriada Corchado, Comunidad Poncito in Llanadas, Sector Las Parcelas and Sector Pastillo and Sector San Antonio de la Tuna in Coto, Sector Capiro and Sector Corea in Galateo Alto, Sector El Ramal in Guerrero, Parcelas Nuevas and Parcelas Viejas in Mora Guerrero, Comunidad Cristal, Sector Planas, Media Cuerda, Parcelas Jobos, Santa B√°rbara, Sector El Ca√±√≥n, Sector El Verdum, Sector La Mantilla, Sector La Marina, Sector La Mina, Sector La Sierra, Tocones, and Villa Pesquera.  Tourism  'Centro Empresarial Playero - Villa Pesquera' One of Isabela's current main industries is tourism, because it's a coastal city with several beautiful beaches, outstanding panoramic views and other diverse attractions such as its rainforest, rivers, lake, cordillera mountains, submarine rivers and caves and archaeological sites among other things. It is visited by many local tourists as well as those seeking some sun and fun from the United States mainland and other countries.  Landmarks and places of interest  There are 12 beaches in Isabela including . The main attractions of Isabela include: * El Pozo Brujo (The Bewitched Well) * Jobos Beach & Pozo de Jacinto * Montones Beach * San Antonio de la Tuna Ruins * Punta Sardina * La Poza de Punta Sandina * La Princesa Beach & Blow Hole * Centro Empresarial Playero - Villa Pesquera * Shacks Beach * R√≠o Guajataca * Guajataca Tunnel * La Cara del Indio (The Indian's Face) * La Posita de Teodoro * Middle Beach * La Posita de Montones * Casa Parroquial * Parroquia San Antonio de la Tuna * La Posita de la Princesa * Shore Island Beach * Paseo Lineal * San Antonio de la Tuna Museum * La Pocita de Isabela (Poza de Teodoro) * La Cueva de las Golondrinas * Cueva los Vientos (Bosque Guajataca) * Photo Museum of Isabela * Alcaldia de Isabela * The Pink House (Casa Rosada), (Demolished in 2014 by the Municipality to be transformed into a museum) Lewiz Menz *Bajura Beach also known as Shacks Beach known for the best wind/sail surfing in the world. In front of the Villa Tropical Apartments is the \\"Blue Hole\\" Coral Reef. A favorite for snorkelers, scuba and free divers and underwater caverns enthusiasts.  Economy   Agriculture  The early economy of the hermitage had been based mainly on cattle [ranching], its derivative products and hogs products, but trading was limited due to many factors: its inland location and topography. The settlement was posted above a hill overlooking the river (now river Guajataca) which made it difficult to use the river as a trading route, as did the location's propensity to disease and outbreaks. After the transfer to the present Isabela location the economic realities that resulted from the new land and property opportunities that were readily available, the healthier environment formed due to the wide open plains and prevalent northern winds, and the proximity to the coast and the natural sea port at the bay of 'Punta Sardina' prompted for the diversification of the agricultural products and an increase in trade. The cultivation of sugar cane, coffee, tobacco, cotton, Cassava/yuca, coconut and other fruits was stimulated further. Isabela continued to flourish until recent years due to the island's economic crisis, the closing of important factories and the rising crime rate.  Industry  Isabela also has a hi- tech plant, a higher education institution, a world-renowned agricultural research center and a major shopping center, Plaza Isabela. Culture  Festivals and events  Isabela celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment. Other festivals and events celebrated in Isabela include: * Three Kings day ‚Äì January - organized by La Casa de la Cultura Isabelina Inc (non profit cultural organization) honoring the wiseman (Reyes Magos) tradition represented by the \\"Reyes Cantores Isabelinos\\". * Isabela Cock Fight Festival ‚Äì February * Textile Festival ‚Äì May * Puerto Rock Steady Music Festival - May * Weave Festival - May * Kite Festival - May * Isabela Muscle Cars Auto Show - August * Isabela International Tango Festival - August https://www.facebook.com/isabelatangofest/ * Las Noches de la Puertorrique√±idad del colegio San Antonio - November * - November * Isabela Has Flavor - November * Holy Innocents' Day ‚Äì December * Caroling ‚ÄúEscuadr√≥n‚Äù (Marina) ‚Äì December * Caroling ‚ÄúSiempreviva‚Äù (Marina) ‚Äì January  Sports  Isabela is also well known for its world-class surfing spots, and hosted two World Cup Surfing Championships, as well as some of the Rip Curl Pro competitions. Isabela had a basketball team that played at the Jose \\"Buga\\" Abreu Coliseum, the Isabela Roosters (\\"Gallitos de Isabela\\"). The team had average success. In 1987, one of its superstars, Frankie Torruella, was diagnosed with heart disease, and the trading of another star player, Edwin Pellot, to the Coamo team, hastened the team's fallout. In 1984, the team lost the championship, four games to two, to the Canovanas Indians team (\\"Indios de Can√≥vanas\\"). Between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, the Bantams were serious championship contenders. In the late 1970s their star player, Mickey Coll, died in a motorcycle accident. The team's first home court was named after him. The Bantams where Isabela's home team until October 2005 when they moved the franchise to Guaynabo. The Playeras, a female volleyball team, played in Isabela for 2 seasons until they also moved to Aguadilla becoming Las Divas. The Isabela Muscle Cars Club, celebrating annual events since 2002 is a popular event in Isabela. On August 28, 2016 the club celebrated their 15th Anniversary at the Coliseum Jose \\"Buga\\" Abreu. The town also has its own classic car club, called \\"Club de Autos Clasicos y Antiguos del Noroeste\\" (Classic and Old Car Club from Northwest). They also celebrate their own Exhibition of Classic Cars at the coliseum in November. The local basketball team was called the \\"Gallitos\\" (\\"Little Cocks,\\" in reference to the slim, lightweight body of the fighting variety) due to the town's fame for quality fighting cocks. The name was translated literally into English as \\"Bantams\\", a variety of dwarf cocks. The town has a cockfighting arena, traditionally called a gallera. Fights were customarily held on Sunday mornings, and the bets and stakes were controlled by the government of Puerto Rico. Prizes were paid based on the fighting record of the cocks. A law prohibiting cockfighting in the U.S. and its territories went into effect in early 2019. Isabela has amateur baseball teams. Also, Isabela is well known for its Fine Step Horses (\\"Caballos de Paso Fino\\") and its world class board, wind and kite surfing spots. Government Like all municipalities in Puerto Rico, Isabela is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Carlos Delgado Altieri, from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Delgado was elected at the 2000 general election. The city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV, which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Mar√≠a Teresa Gonz√°lez and Gilberto Rodr√≠guez were elected as District Senators.Elecciones Generales 2012: Escrutinio General on CEEPUR Transportation  There are 5 bridges in Isabela. Symbols  Flag  The Isabela Flag Isabela's flag derives its design, colors and symbolism from its coat of arms. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top and bottom stripe are yellow and the center one green. The coat of arms may be superposed on the green stripe in the center.  Coat of arms  The Original Coat of Arms of Isabela The town's coat of arms, dated 1819, is divided an olive tree in its center, symbolizes the first inhabitants of Isabela and of the island of Puerto Rico, the Igneris Indians. The gold represents the Ta√≠no Indians (they made extensive use of gold), who lived in this area about two hundred years before the discovery of the island. The gold bell represented in the center stripe between two cactus is a symbol of the town of San Antonio de la Tuna. The two cocks represent the bravery of the inhabitants and Isabela's famous fighting cocks. The horse represents the cattle wealth of the region and honors the fine step horses (Paso Fino) for which Isabela is famous. The coat of arms is embellished with a mural crown having three towers, the standard emblem at the time for formally established 'pueblos' (townships) under Spanish rule. A new coat of arms is shown here; it depicts a revised mural crown with five towers to represent a city, but historically, only 11 communities in Puerto Rico were conferred this title under Spanish rule. On the occasion of the celebration of 186 years of Isabela ur was necessary to adopt an ordinance to establish properly the historical veracity and heraldic elements of the emblazoned shield and official seal of the City of Isabela. The following information was drafted pursuant to Ordinance Number 3, series 2005-2006 and approved by the Municipal Legislature on August 5, 2005: \\"The Mural Crown: Current mural crown that has the coat of Isabela has three towers. Due to population increase of over 50,000 inhabitants who had Isabela in this last decade, the HUD office in Washington DC, conferred status as a \\"city\\" to Isabela last year. Given this demographic reality and focused on the mural crown that represents the spirit of unity and growth of the inhabitants of our city of Isabela, we understand appropriate that the crown mural consists of \\"five\\" distinct towers that symbolize the passage from town to city.\\" Gallery Playa de Isabela, Puerto Rico - panoramio.jpgBeach in Isabela Villa Monta√±a Beach Resort - Isabela, Puerto Rico - panoramio (9).jpgVilla Monta√±a Beach Resort Bosque Estatal de Guajataca, Puerto Rico.jpgGuajataca State Forest Isabela, Puerto Rico - panoramio (1).jpg  See also  *List of Puerto Ricans *History of Puerto Rico *Did you know-Puerto Rico?

Other names are ; ; Polish Mukaczewo; Slovak and Czech: Mukaƒçevo; ; (Munkatsh). History Early history Archaeological excavation suggest that early settlements existed here before the Middle Ages. For example, a Celtic oppidum and metal works center that existed in the 3rd-1st century BC were found between the Halish and Lovachka mountains. A Thracian fort of the Iron Age (10th century BC) was found on the mountain of Tupcha. Around the 1st century the area was occupied by the Carpi people who displaced the local Celts from the area. Hungarian rule In 895 the Hungarian tribes entered the Carpathian Basin through the Verecke Pass, about north of present-day Mukachevo. In 1397, the town and its surrounding was granted by King Sigismund of Hungary to his distant cousin, the exiled prince of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Theodor Koriatovich, who used to administrate the Ruthenian Podolia region of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, until was exiled for disobedience by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great in 1392. Theodor therefore became a vassal of Hungary and settled many Ruthenians in the territory. Other sources, however, state that Theodor bought the town and the surrounding area in 1396. During the 15th century, the city prospered and became a prominent craft and trade center for the region. In 1445, the town became a Hungarian free royal town. It was also granted the rights of Magdeburg law. During the 16th century, Mukachevo became part of the Principality of Transylvania. The 17th century (from 1604-1711) was a time of continuous struggle against the expansionist intentions of the Habsburg Empire for the Principality. In 1687 the anti-Habsburg Revolt of Imre Th√∂k√∂ly started out from Mukachevo. The region also played an important role in R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence. St Nicholas Monastery (1772-1806) Austrian control and revolts After the defeat of Francis II R√°k√≥czi the city came under Austrian control in the mid-18th century as part of the Kingdom of Hungary and was made a key fortress of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1726, the Palanok Castle and the town, before 1711 owned by the R√°k√≥czi family, was given by the Habsburgs to the Sch√∂nborn family, who were responsible for an expansion of the town. They also settled many Germans in the territory, thereby causing an economic boom of the region. During 1796‚Äì1897, the city's castle, until then a strong fortress, became a prison. The Greek national hero Alexander Ypsilanti was imprisoned at the Palanok Castle between 1821 and 1823. Mukachevo during and after the wars The Scala cinema in the centre of Mukachevo, 1942. Fortepan archive In 1919, after the American-Rusyns agreed with Tom√°≈° Masaryk to incorporate Carpathian Ruthenia into Czechoslovakia, the whole of Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied by Czechoslovak troops. On June 4, 1920, Mukachevo officially became part of Czechoslovakia by the Treaty of Trianon. In November 1938, a part of the territory of the former Kingdom of Hungary was re-annexed by Hungary as part of the First Vienna Award. Without delay the new authorities decreed the expulsion of all the Jews without Hungarian citizenship. As a consequence Polish and Russian Jews, long-term residents of the now Hungarian-controlled Transcarpathian region, and also from Mukachevo, as well as the native Jews who could not prove their citizenship, were deported over the Ukrainian border where their fate was sealed by the hands of a German Einsatzgruppe commando led by Friedrich Jeckeln. On August 27 and 28 1941 they were all murdered by the Germans in Kamianets-Podilskyi's massacre.Kamenets-Podolski in Yad Vashem Even so, Mukachevo's population still held an important Jewish component, until in 1944 all the Jews were deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi German Eichmann Commando. They were the last Jewish community in Europe to succumb to the Holocaust. In the end of 1944, the Red Army stormed Carpathian Ruthenia. At first the territory was given to the reestablished Czechoslovakia, then became part of the Soviet Union by a treaty between the two countries, later in 1945. The Soviet Union began a policy of expulsion of the Hungarian population. In 1945, the city was ceded to the Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine). Since 2002, Mukachevo has been the seat of the Roman Catholic diocese comprising Transcarpathia. Climate Mukachevo has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen: Dfb). Demographics In 1921, 21,000 people lived in Mukachevo. Of these, 48 percent were Jews, 24 percent were Rusyns, and 22 percent were Hungarians. The city's population in 1966 was 50,500. Of these, 60% were Ukrainians, 18 percent Hungarians, 10% Russians and 6% Jews. According to the 2001 census, 82,200 people live in Mukachevo. Population in 1989 was 91,000, in 2004 77,300 and in 2008 93,738. Its population includes: *Ukrainians (77.1%) *Russians (9.0%) *Hungarians (8.5%) *Germans (1.9%) *Roma (1.4%) *Ashkenazi & Sephardic Jews (1.1%) Residents in seven villages of the Mukachevo Raion have the option to learn the Hungarian language in a school or home school environment.https://www.slovoidilo.ua/2017/09/26/infografika/polityka/skilky- ditej-ukrayini-navchayutsya-movamy-naczionalnyx-menshyn Economy Railway Station in Mukachevo, Ukraine Fischer Sports, an Austrian company that produces Nordic Skiing, Alpine Skiing and Hockey equipment has a factory in Mukachevo.

Jewish community :See also Munkacs (Hasidic dynasty) There are documents in the Berehove State Archives which indicate that Sephardi Jews lived in Munk√°cs and the surrounding villages as early as the second half of the seventeenth century. The Jewish community of Munk√°cs was an amalgam of Galician and Hungarian Hasidic Jewry, Orthodox Jews, and Zionists. The town is most noted for its Chief Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira who led the community until his death in 1937. By 1851, Munkacs supported a large yeshiva, thereby demonstrating the community's commitment to Talmudic learning and piety. Materially impoverished, yet wealthy in ideological debate, the Jews of interwar Munkacs constituted almost half of the town's population. The Munkacs Jewish community was famous for its Hasidic activity as well as its innovations in Zionism and modern Jewish education.One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and has been released under the GFDL: The Jewish population of Munkacs grew from 2,131 in 1825 to 5,049 in 1891 (almost 50 percent of the total population) to 7,675 in 1910 (about 44 percent). By 1921, the 10,000 Jews still made up about half the residents, though by 1930, the proportion had dropped to 43 percent, with a little over 11,000 Jews. The Jews of Munkacs constituted 11 percent of the Jewry of Subcarpathian Rus. Interwar Munkacs had a very large Jewish population, which was most visible on the Shabbat. On that day most stores were closed and, after services, the streets filled with Hasidic Jews in their traditional garb. The first movie house in the town was established by a Hasidic Jew, and it too closed on the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. The Chief Rabbi of Munkacs, Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira (who led the community from 1913 until his death in 1937) was the most outspoken voice of religious anti-Zionism. He had succeeded his father, Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Spira, who had earlier inherited the mantle of leadership from his father Rabbi Shlomo Spira. He was also a Hasidic rebbe with a significant number of followers. Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira was succeeded by his son-in-law, Rabbi Baruch Yehoshua Yerachmiel Rabinowicz. Along with the dominant Munkacser hasidic community there co-existed smaller yet vibrant Hasidic groups who were followers of the rebbes Belz, of Spinka, Zidichov, and Vizhnitz. By the time of the Holocaust there were nearly 30 synagogues in town, many of which were Shtieblech (\\"[small] house\\" - small [Hasidic] synagogues). The Hebrew Gymnasium was founded in Munkacs five years after the first Hebrew speaking elementary school in Czechoslovakia was established there in 1920. It soon became the most prestigious Hebrew high school east of Warsaw. Zionist activism along with chasidic pietism contributed to a community percolating with excitement, intrigue and at times internecine conflict Latorica river In 1935, Chaim Kugel, formerly director of the Munkacs gymnasium (Jewish high school) and then Jewish Party delegate to the Czechoslovak Parliament, gave a speech during a parliamentary debate: \\"‚Ä¶It is completely impossible to adequately describe the poverty in the area. The Jews‚Ä¶ are affected equally along with the rest‚Ä¶. I strongly wish to protest any attempt to blame the poverty of the Subcarpathian Ruthenian peasantry on the Jews\\" Quoted in Sole, \\"Subcarpathian Ruthenia, 1918-1938,\\" in The Jews of Czechoslovakia, vol. 1, p. 132. (Kugel later got to Mandatory Palestine and eventually became mayor of the Israeli city of Holon). Government policies were covertly directed against Jews, who bore a heavy share of taxes and had difficulty getting high civil service positions. In 1939, the Hungarians seized and annexed Subcarpathian Rus‚Äîincluding Munkacs‚Äîtaking advantage of the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Though antisemitic legislation was introduced by the Hungarian authorities, Subcarpathian Rus, like the rest of Hungary, remained a relative haven for Jews until Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in 1944. In the spring of 1944 there were nearly 15,000 Jewish residents of the town. This ended on May 30, 1944 when the city was pronounced Judenrein (free of Jews after ghettoization and a series of deportations to Auschwitz). Today, Mukachevo is experiencing a Jewish renaissance of sorts with the establishment of a supervised kosher kitchen, a mikveh, Jewish summer camp in addition to the prayer services which take place three times daily. In July 2006, a new synagogue was dedicated on the site of a pre-war hasidic synagogue. Architectural landmarks *Palanok Castle, 14th century. The castle of Munk√°cs played an important role during the anti-Habsburg revolts in this territory and present-day Slovakia (1604‚Äì1711), especially at the beginning of the anti-Habsburg Revolt of Imre Th√∂k√∂ly (1685‚Äì1688), as well as at the beginning of the revolt of Ferenc II. R√°k√≥czi (early 18th century). This important fortress became a prison from the end of the 18th century and was used until 1897.

In Great Britain, he was known for his treatise on singing birds (Naturgeschichte der Stubenv√∂gel, Natural History of Cage Birds, 1795). Biography Bechstein was born in Waltershausen in the district of Gotha in Thuringia. He studied theology for four years at the University of Jena, and spent time hunting and roaming the forests as opportunities permitted. After leaving school, he taught for some years, but gave teaching up to devote himself to outdoor pursuits. In 1795, he founded the school of forestry at Waltershausen, and in 1800, the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen made him the director of the forestry school at Dreissigacker near Meiningen in the neighbouring district of Schmalkalden- Meiningen. After the death of his own son, Bechstein adopted his nephew Ludwig Bechstein. Bechstein was a prolific zoologist and one of the first concerned with wildlife conservation: besides his ornithological work, he also published works calling for the protection of animals that were commonly considered harmful or pests at the time, such as bats. Bechstein's Bat was named in his honour. Partial list of publications * Gemeinn√ºtzige Naturgeschichte Deutschlands nach allen drey Reichen. 4 vols.

Raine has commented on his education: \\"At Barnard Castle I was taught by an absolutely remarkable English teacher, Arnold Snodgrass, a friend of W. H. Auden at Oxford [and later Robert Graves]. There was no question that he altered my mindset on things and made me very critical.\\"http://robertgraves.org/trust/print.php?id=7313 At school he wrote \\"pimply Dylan Thomas\\" poems, some of which he sent to Philip Toynbee, then lead reviewer at The Observer. Raine received his university education at Exeter College, University of Oxford, where he received a BA in English and later received his B.Phil.British Council: Biography Career He taught at Oxford and followed a literary career as book editor for New Review, editor of Quarto, and poetry editor at the New Statesman. He became poetry editor at publishers Faber and Faber in 1981, and has been a fellow of New College, Oxford, since 1991, retiring from his post as tutor in June 2010. In 1972 he married Ann Pasternak Slater, a now retired fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford. They have one daughter and three sons. Moses Raine is a playwright and Nina Raine a director and playwright. Craig Raine is founder and editor of the literary magazine Aret√© and a frequent contributor. His works include a number of poetry collections:Nielsen BookData at 27 November 2008 The Onion, Memory (1978), A Martian Sends a Postcard Home (1979), A Free Translation (1981), Rich (1984), History: The Home Movie (1994), and Clay. Whereabouts Unknown (1996). His reviews and essays are collected in two anthologies: Haydn and the Valve Trumpet (1990) and In Defence of T. S. Eliot (2000). A short critical- biographical study of Eliot, T. S. Eliot: Image, Text and Context, was published in 2007.

Personal life Howe is the daughter of the writer Philip Morton Shand by his fourth wife, Sybil Mary Shand (n√©e Sissons, previously Mrs. Slee). As such, she is a half-aunt to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (n√©e Shand, formerly Parker Bowles), whose father, Bruce Shand, was son of P. Morton Shand by a previous marriage. Elspeth Shand was educated at Wycombe Abbey, a leading private school for girls, and at the London School of Economics. She married the rising politician Geoffrey Howe in 1953, and had three children, Caroline (Cary), and twins, Amanda and Alec. Career Elspeth Howe served as deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission from 1975 to 1979, and in various other capacities from 1980. She was later made Chair of the Broadcasting Standards Commission. In the 1999 New Year's Honours she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

He is currently the David Dornsife Chair in Neuroscience, as well as Professor of Psychology, Philosophy, and Neurology, at the University of Southern California, and, additionally, an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute.Faculty Profile He was previously the chair of neurology at the University of Iowa for 20 years. Damasio heads the Brain and Creativity Institute, and has authored several books: his most recent work, Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain (2010), explores the relationship between the brain and consciousness. Damasio's research in neuroscience has shown that emotions play a central role in social cognition and decision-making.  Life and work  Damasio studied medicine at the University of Lisbon Medical School, where he also did his neurological residency and completed his doctorate. For part of his studies, he researched behavioral neurology under the supervision of Norman Geschwind of the Aphasia Research Center in Boston. Damasio's main field is neurobiology, especially the neural systems which underlie emotion, decision- making, memory, language and consciousness. Damasio might believe that emotions play a critical role in high-level cognition‚Äîan idea counter to dominant 20th-century views in psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. Damasio in 2008. Damasio formulated the somatic marker hypothesis,Damasio AR. \\"The somatic marker hypothesis and the possible functions of the pre-frontal cortex\\". Transactions of the Royal Society. (London) 351:1413‚Äì1420. 1996. a theory about how emotions and their biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making (both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously). Emotions provide the scaffolding for the construction of social cognition and are required for the self processes which undergird consciousness. \\"Damasio provides a contemporary scientific validation of the linkage between feelings and the body by highlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells ... this personalized embodiment of mind.\\"Lara Trout. The Politics of Survival (2010). p. 74. The somatic marker hypothesis has inspired many neuroscience experiments carried out in laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major impact in contemporary science and philosophy. Damasio has been named by the Institute for Scientific Information as one of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade. Current work on the biology of moral decisions, neuro-economics, social communication, and drug-addiction, has been strongly influenced by Damasio's hypothesis. An article published in the Archives of Scientific Psychology in 2014 named Damasio one of the 100 most eminent psychologist of the modern era. (Diener et al. Archives of Scientific Psychology, 2014, 2, 20‚Äì32). The June‚ÄìJuly issue of Sciences Humaines included Damasio in its list of 50 key thinkers in the human sciences of the past two centuries. Damasio also proposed that emotions are part of homeostatic regulation and are rooted in reward/punishment mechanisms. He recovered William James' perspective on feelings as a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an \\"as-if-body-loop\\" device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation process later uncovered by mirror neurons). He demonstrated experimentally that the insular cortex is a critical platform for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and he uncovered cortical and subcortical induction sites for human emotions, e.g. in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala.Damasio AR, Grabowski TJ, Bechara A, Damasio H, Ponto LLB, Parvizi J, Hichwa RD. Subcortical and cortical brain activity during the feeling of self- generated emotions\\" Nature Neuroscience 3:1049‚Äì1056. 2000 He also demonstrated that while the insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process. He has continued to investigate the neural basis of feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well. He regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience. In another development, Damasio proposed that the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of axonal projections that converge on certain nodes out of which projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence (the convergence-divergence zones). This architecture is applicable to the understanding of memory processes and of aspects of consciousness related to the access of mental contents.Damasio AR. Time-locked multiregional retroactivation: a systems level proposal for the neural substrates of recall and recognition\\" Cognition 33:25‚Äì62. 1989 In The Feeling of What Happens, Damasio laid the foundations of the \\"enchainment of precedences\\": \\"the nonconscious neural signaling of an individual organism begets the protoself which permits core self and core consciousness, which allow for an autobiographical self, which permits extended consciousness. At the end of the chain, extended consciousness permits conscience. Damasio's research depended significantly on establishing the modern human lesion method, an enterprise made possible by Hanna Damasio's structural neuroimaging/neuroanatomy work complemented by experimental neuroanatomy (with Gary Van Hoesen and Josef Parvizi), experimental neuropsychology (with Antoine Bechara, Ralph Adolphs, and Dan Tranel) and functional neuroimaging (with Kaspar Meyer, Jonas Kaplan, and Mary Helen Immordino-Yang). The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease.Hyman B, Van Hoesen GW, Damasio A, Barnes C. Alzheimer's disease: cell-specific pathology isolates the hippocampal formation\\" Science 225:1168‚Äì1170. 1984 As a clinician, he and his collaborators have studied and treated disorders of behaviour and cognition, and movement disorders. Damasio's books deal with the relationship between emotions and their brain substrates. His 1994 book, Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain, won the Science et Vie prize, was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and is translated in over 30 languages. It is regarded as one of the most influential books of the past two decades.In January 2010, Sciences Humaines named it one of the 20 books that changed the vision of the world. The book has been cited over 13,000 times His second book, The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness, was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the New York Times Book Review, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year, a Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and has over 30 foreign editions. Damasio's Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, was published in 2003. In it, Damasio suggested that the philosopher Baruch Spinoza's thinking foreshadowed discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mind-body problem and that Spinoza was a protobiologist. Damasio's latest book is Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain. In it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core self. The book received the Corinne International Book Prize. Damasio at Fronteiras do Pensamento (Frontiers of Thought) in 2013 Damasio is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He is the recipient of several prizes, amongst them the Grawemeyer Award, the Honda Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award in Science and Technology and the Beaumont Medal from the American Medical Association, as well as honorary degrees from, most recently, the Sorbonne (Universit√© Paris Descartes), shared with his wife Hanna Damasio. He has also received doctorates from the Universities of Aachen, Copenhagen, Leiden, Barcelona, Coimbra, Leuven and numerous others. In 2013, the Escola Secund√°ria Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio was dedicated in Lisbon. He says he writes in the belief that \\"scientific knowledge can be a pillar to help humans endure and prevail.\\"Ant√≥nio R.

In their seven-year career they released two studio albums and eight singles. There were three line-up changes with two of the original members leaving halfway through. In 2006, the only two female members launched their own band Booty Luv, which was taking off following the success of their debut single \\"Boogie 2nite\\". After their second album failed to chart and with low sales of their last two singles, the band decided to split. In May 2012, the four members from the third line-up toured Australia with three of the members of S Club 7, but the reunion was short lived with no full tour or new material surfacing. History 2001‚Äì2002: Formation, original lineup and Look Inside Big Brovaz originally comprised three women (Cherise, who won the MOBO for best unsigned artist in 2000; Dion; and Nadia, born in Reading), three men (J-Rock; Flawless, born in Lagos; and Randy), plus two producers Skillz (also known as JJC, born in Kano, who also managed his group 419 Squad), and Fingaz. The group was referred to as a softer version of the So Solid Crew. The group was brought together by Fingaz, one of the collective's producers, who already worked under the title \\"Big Brovaz\\". The \\"Big Brovaz\\" team asked the individual members to showcase their talent alongside underground London R&B; and hip hop artists on a compilation that was being put together, entitled Big Brovaz ‚Äì Watching You. On the album, rather than giving each member an individual track, the producers decided to make the artists work together and perform on the same tracks. That collaborative effort led to the group's formation. The Big Brovaz ‚Äì Watching You compilation sold over two thousand copies. A track from the album, which featured west London R&B; singer Cherise, was picked up by the organizer of the annual MOBO award and she was asked to compete in the annual MOBO Unsigned talent competition where she achieved first place. Cherise was signed and later release her own solo album. Following this, the group was picked up by Sony Records. Female member Cherise released a solo album Look Inside before the debut album from Big Brovaz was released. It only spawned one single, \\"2nd Best\\", while the album won a MOBO award. 2002‚Äì2004: Commercial breakthrough and Nu Flow The group's breakthrough was in October 2002 when the group's debut single, \\"Nu Flow\\" became a hit, particularly in the UK where it made the top 3, spending over four months inside the top 75. Their debut album of the same name was released on 4 November 2002 to rave reviews. This single was covered in 2006 in a UK Halifax TV advertisement. The group's success continued into 2003 with the release of further singles from their debut album. The group's second single, \\"OK\\" made Number 7 in the UK Singles Chart prompting a re-release of the album with a re-ordered track listing and new tracks on 10 February 2003. However, the album was re-issued yet again one month later, on 24 March 2003, with another re-ordered track listing and a new track entitled \\"Favourite Things\\". This song became the group's third single and was famous for sampling the song \\"My Favourite Things\\" from the musical The Sound Of Music. As well as their own interpretation of the classic song, the group decided to include a cover of the original as a hidden bonus track on version three of \\"Nu Flow\\". \\"Favourite Things\\" became the group's biggest highest charting hit to date, peaking at Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and spending three weeks inside the top 3 of that chart. The fourth single taken from the album was \\"Baby Boy\\". The music video for the single was famous for being inspired by the sitcom Friends. \\"Baby Boy\\" became the group's fourth top 10 hit in a row, peaking at Number 4 in the UK singles chart. The fifth single from the album, \\"Ain't What You Do\\", which sampled Fun Boy Three and Bananarama's collaboration It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It) was the group's fifth top 15 hit, peaking at Number 15. The group's debut album was certified platinum in the UK, a great achievement for UK R&B; and hip hop. The group next appeared on-screen in the 2004 film Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, in which they performed a version of Sly & the Family Stone's \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" and was featured on the Soundtrack. They also released the single \\"We Wanna Thank You (The Things You Do)\\" as the theme song from the movie in April 2004. This was the collective's smallest hit to date, peaking at Number 17 in the UK singles charts. Shortly after this, rapper Flawless was stopped at LAX airport and was found to be in possession of about 2.2 grams (0.07 ounces) of Cannabis out of the UK. This resulted in his sacking from the group in 2004, leaving the remaining 5 group members and two producers to carry on without him. 2004‚Äì2007: third line up, Re Entry and split Later in 2004, one member down, the group released another new single, \\"Yours Fatally\\", which was due to be taken from their second album. Although receiving good reviews, the single did not catch on as much as their record company had hoped and were subsequently dropped by their label due to poor sales in late 2004. After being dropped, the group decided to split up and pursue solo ventures. The girls from the group were rumoured to be creating a group called \\"Little Sistaz\\" with Futurepop artist Olivia Davies but the group never materialised. In 2006, an announcement on their official website messageboard was made by group member Randy confirming that the group had re-united but as a four-piece.Big Brovaz message from group member Randy to the fans. The re-formed group now consisted of Nadia, Cherise, J-Rock and Randy, losing Dion. Dion decided not to reunite with the group and later became a vocal coach The reformed group's Myspace webpage confirmed that a new single would be released 24 April entitled \\"Hangin' Around\\". \\"Hangin' Around\\" became the group's lowest charting hit to date, peaking outside the UK top 40. However, despite this setback, the group continued and they announced that their second album \\"Re-Entry\\" (originally due for a May release) would finally be released in early 2007. The third single from the album (as \\"Yours Fatally\\" was to be included), confirmed as \\"Big Bro Thang\\", was announced to have a release before the album. The song won the fan's voting poll vote on their official website and due to popular demand, was picked as the third single. The single \\"Big Bro Thang\\" was released with six remixes launching on the iTunes website between 26 February 2007 and 19 March 2007 with the album Re-Entry finally released on 9 April 2007. In an interview with online magazine Popjustice, Nadia and Cherise confirmed that all promotion for Re-Entry had finished, meaning \\"Big Bro Thang\\" was the third and final single from the album. 2012: Mini reunion tour In May 2012, the four surviving original members of the band set off on a tour of Australia with three members of pop group S Club 7. 2018: Stepback 90s In October and December 2018, the four surviving original members of the band also joined with Peter Andre, 5ive, S Club 3, Boyzlife (Keith Duffy and Shane Lynch), B*Witched, Blazin' Squad and East 17, for a 5-date revival arena tour. Cherise and Nadia also performed as Booty Luv. Solo careers Nadia and Cherise are now also performing under the name Booty Luv. Their first single, a cover of Tweet's \\"Boogie 2nite\\" was released in the UK via the Hed Kandi label on 27 November 2006. The single received good reviews and became a favourite on the UK club scene. It peaked at Number 2 in its third week in the UK Singles Chart, spending eleven weeks in the Top 15 and sixteen weeks in the Top 40. Four more singles have since been released, with Shine, a cover of the Luther Vandross song, peaking at Number 10 in the UK singles chart. Third and fourth singles \\"Don't Mess with My Man\\", a cover of the Lucy Pearl song, and an original song \\"Some Kinda Rush\\" both reached the Top 20, peaking at number 11 and 19. \\"Dance Dance\\" was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Booty Luv's d√©but album Boogie 2nite was released on 17 September 2007, and reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart. J-Rock and Randy also went on to form their own group, Party Dark, falling into the Party/House and Rap genres and were signed to Champion Records in 2009. On 15 March 2010 they released their first single, \\"Is That You?\\", which was well received by DJs such as Huw Stephens, Bobby Friction and Eddie Temple-Morris and the music video reached Number 1 in the MTV Dancefloor Charts four weeks in a row. Party Dark released a second single in the later part of 2010 called \\"Let's Go\\". This was announced via a teaser trailer on YouTube and a remix competition on their own and their label's websites. J-Rock was the protagonist of an All 4 documentary entitled Giving Up the Weed.

Lillie, 1909 Bateson was born in Whitby on the Yorkshire coast, the son of William Henry Bateson, Master of St John's College, Cambridge. He was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College in Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1883 with a first in natural sciences. Taking up embryology, he went to the United States to investigate the development of Balanoglossus. This worm-like enteropneust hemichordate led to his interest in vertebrate origins. In 1883-4 he worked in the laboratory of William Keith Brooks, at the Chesapeake Zo√∂logical Laboratory in Hampton, Virginia.Johns Hopkins University Circular Nov.(1883) vol III. no 27.pg 4. Turning from morphology to study evolution and its methods, he returned to England and became a Fellow of St John's. Studying variation and heredity, he travelled in western Central Asia.  Work on biological variation (to 1900)  Bateson's work published before 1900 systematically studied the structural variation displayed by living organisms and the light this might shed on the mechanism of biological evolution,Scientific papers of William Bateson. RC Punnett (Ed) : Cambridge University Press 1928 Vol 1 and was strongly influenced by both Charles Darwin's approach to the collection of comprehensive examples, and Francis Galton's quantitative (\\"biometric\\") methods. In his first significant contribution,Some cases of variation in secondary sexual characters statistically examined, Proc Zool Soc 1892 he shows that some biological characteristics (such as the length of forceps in earwigs) are not distributed continuously, with a normal distribution, but discontinuously (or \\"dimorphically\\"). He saw the persistence of two forms in one population as a challenge to the then current conceptions of the mechanism of heredity, and says \\"The question may be asked, does the dimorphism of which cases have now been given represent the beginning of a division into two species?‚Äù In his 1894 book, Materials for the study of variation,Materials for the study of variation, treated with especial regard to discontinuity in the origin of species William Bateson 1861‚Äì1926. London : Macmillan 1894 xv, 598 p Bateson took this survey of biological variation significantly further. He was concerned to show that biological variation exists both continuously, for some characters, and discontinuously for others, and coined the terms \\"meristic\\" and \\"substantive\\" for the two types. In common with Darwin, he felt that quantitative characters could not easily be \\"perfected\\" by the selective force of evolution, because of the perceived problem of the \\"swamping effect of intercrossing\\", but proposed that discontinuously varying characters could. In Materials Bateson noted and named homeotic mutations, in which an expected body-part has been replaced by another. The animal mutations he studied included bees with legs instead of antennae; crayfish with extra oviducts; and in humans, polydactyly, extra ribs, and males with extra nipples. These mutations are in the homeobox genes which control the pattern of body formation during early embryonic development of animals. The 1995 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded for work on these genes. They are thought to be especially important to the basic development of all animals. These genes have a crucial function in many, and perhaps all, animals. In Materials unaware of Gregor Mendel's results, Bateson wrote concerning the mechanism of biological heredity, \\"The only way in which we may hope to get at the truth is by the organization of systematic experiments in breeding, a class of research that calls perhaps for more patience and more resources than any other form of biological enquiry. Sooner or later such an investigation will be undertaken and then we shall begin to know.\\" Mendel had cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, performing exactly the experiment Bateson wanted. Also in Materials, he stated what has been called Bateson's rule, namely that extra legs are mirror-symmetric with their neighbours, such as when an extra leg appears in an insect's leg socket. It appears to be caused by the leaking of positional signals across the limb-limb interface, so that the extra limb's polarity is reversed. In 1897 he reported some significant conceptual and methodological advances in his study of variation.Progress in the study of variation I. Science Progress I, 1897 \\"I have argued that variations of a discontinuous nature may play a prepondering part in the constitution of a new species.\\" He attempts to silence his critics (the \\"biometricians\\") who misconstrue his definition of discontinuity of variation by clarification of his terms: \\"a variation is discontinuous if, when all the individuals of a population are breeding freely together, there is not simple regression to one mean form, but a sensible preponderance of the variety over the intermediates‚Ä¶ The essential feature of a discontinuous variation is therefore that, be the cause what it may, there is not complete blending between variety and type. The variety persists and is not ‚Äúswamped by intercrossing‚Äù. But critically, he begins to report a series of breeding experiments, conducted by Edith Saunders, using the alpine brassica Biscutella laevigata in the Cambridge botanic gardens. In the wild, hairy and smooth forms of otherwise identical plants are seen together. They intercrossed the forms experimentally, ‚ÄúWhen therefore the well-grown mongrel plants are examined, they present just the same appearance of discontinuity which the wild plants at the Tosa Falls do. This discontinuity is, therefore, the outward sign of the fact that in heredity the two characters of smoothness and hairiness do not completely blend, and the offspring do not regress to one mean form, but to two distinct forms.‚Äù At about this time, Hugo de Vries and Carl Erich Correns began similar plant-breeding experiments. But, unlike Bateson, they were familiar with the extensive plant breeding experiments of Gregor Mendel in the 1860s, and they did not cite Bateson's work. Critically, Bateson gave a lecture to the Royal Horticultural Society in July 1899,Bateson, W. (1900) \\"Hybridisation and Cross-Breeding as a Method of Scientific Investigation\\" J. RHS (1900) 24: 59 ‚Äì 66, a report of a lecture given at the RHS Hybrid Conference in 1899. Full text: which was attended by Hugo de Vries, in which he described his investigations into discontinuous variation, his experimental crosses, and the significance of such studies for the understanding of heredity. He urged his colleagues to conduct large-scale, well-designed and statistically analysed experiments of the sort that, although he did not know it, Mendel had already conducted, and which would be \\"rediscovered\\" by de Vries and Correns just six months later.  Founding the discipline of genetics  Bateson became famous as the outspoken Mendelian antagonist of Walter Raphael Weldon, his former teacher, and of Karl Pearson who led the biometric school of thinking. The debate centred on saltationism versus gradualism (Darwin had represented gradualism, but Bateson was a saltationist).Gillham, Nicholas W. (2001). Evolution by Jumps: Francis Galton and William Bateson and the Mechanism of Evolutionary Change. Genetics 159: 1383‚Äì1392. Later, Ronald Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane showed that discrete mutations were compatible with gradual evolution, helping to bring about the modern evolutionary synthesis. Between 1900 and 1910 Bateson directed a rather informal \\"school\\" of genetics at Cambridge. His group consisted mostly of women associated with Newnham College, Cambridge, and included both his wife Beatrice, and her sister Florence Durham. They provided assistance for his research program at a time when Mendelism was not yet recognised as a legitimate field of study. The women, such as Muriel Wheldale (later Onslow), carried out a series of breeding experiments in various plant and animal species between 1902 and 1910. The results both supported and extended Mendel's laws of heredity. Hilda Blanche Killby, who had finished her studies with the Newnham College Mendelians in 1901, aided Bateson in the replication of Mendel's crosses in peas. She conducted independent breeding experiments in rabbits and bantam fowl, as well. Bateson first suggested using the word \\"genetics\\" (from the Greek genn≈ç, Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩœé; \\"to give birth\\") to describe the study of inheritance and the science of variation in a personal letter to Adam Sedgwick (1854‚Äì1913, zoologist at Cambridge, not the Adam Sedgwick (1785‚Äì1873) who had been Darwin's professor), dated 18 April 1905. Bateson first used the term \\"genetics\\" publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906.Gordon M. Shepherd (2010). \\"Mendel's proposal that heredity is the outcome of 'independent factors' led William Bateson in England in 1906 to suggest the term 'genetics' as a specific biological term for the study of the rules of heredity. Following Bateson, Wilhelm Johannsen in Denmark in 1909 proposed the term 'gene' for the 'independent factors', as well as 'genotype' for the combination of genes in an individual and 'phenotype'\\" (Creating modern neuroscience , p. 17). Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word \\"gene\\" to describe the units of hereditary information, De Vries had introduced the word \\"pangene\\" for the same concept already in 1889, and etymologically the word genetics has parallels with Darwin's concept of pangenesis. Bateson and Edith Saunders also coined the word \\"allelomorph\\" (\\"other form\\"), which was later shortened to allele. Bateson co-discovered genetic linkage with Reginald Punnett and Edith Saunders, and he and Punnett founded the Journal of Genetics in 1910. Bateson also coined the term \\"epistasis\\" to describe the genetic interaction of two independent loci.  Other biographical information  William Bateson became director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution in 1910 and moved with his family to Merton Park in Surrey. He was director there until his sudden death in February 1926. During his time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution he became interested in the chromosome theory of heredity and promoted the study of cytology by the appointment of W. C. F. Newton and in 1923 Cyril Dean Darlington. In his later years he was a friend and confidant of the German Erwin Baur. Their correspondence includes their discussion of eugenics. His son was the anthropologist and cyberneticist Gregory Bateson. In June 1894 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Darwin Medal in 1904 and their Royal Medal in 1920. He also delivered their Croonian lecture in 1920. He was the president of the British Association in 1913‚Äì1914. He founded The Genetics Society in 1919, one of the first learned societies dedicated to Genetics. The John Innes Centre holds a Bateson Lecture in his honour at the annual John Innes Symposium. He was an atheist.\\"William Bateson was a very militant atheist and a very bitter man, I fancy. Knowing that I was interested in biology, they invited me when I was still a school girl to go down and see the experimental garden. I remarked to him what I thought then, and still think, that doing research must be the most wonderful thing in the world and he snapped at me that it wasn't wonderful at all, it was tedious, disheartening, annoying and anyhow you didn't need an experimental garden to do research.\\" Interview with Dr. Cecilia Gaposchkin by Owen Gingerich, 5 March 1968.

At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons, and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and given a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 aliases, he became known as \\"Mr. Nice\\" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice. After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr. Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation. Early life and education Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher. Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower. He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker. He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview, and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving. After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs. Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber. Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams. In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher. He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967‚Äì68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968‚Äì69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969‚Äì70) to study philosophy of science. Marks' daughter, Amber Marks, is a professor of Criminal Law at Queen Mary, University of London. Drug empire Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges. Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century. With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition. He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London. After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record. Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver. After paying Marks ¬£5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of ¬£20,000. Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs ‚Äì this arrangement netted him a profit of ¬£7,500. Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation. The gang became dissatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England; McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections. Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses. By 1972, he was making ¬£50,000 with each shipment. By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA. The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections. As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport. Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe. Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6. With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974. At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane; the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter. Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal. With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs. A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man. Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom. In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' ‚Äì making himself ¬£300,000 in the process; he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport. In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America. In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year. In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing ¬£15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis. When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as ¬£30,000 in cash. Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities). The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling but guilty of using false passports, and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentence was passed. HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence. Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime of which Marks had been acquitted, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle. In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted. Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal. Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America. He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam. Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service. In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone). The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution. Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan. In 1986, he settled in Majorca, and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America. The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted. As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively. When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs. In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States. Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada. This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous other law enforcement organisations around the world. Trial and imprisonment Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona, and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid. There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act. In his autobiography, Marks stated that \\"although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true.\\" The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole. The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida. After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law. He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia. He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia. Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US. In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain. The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees. He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man. As the trial began in July 1990, Patrick Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself. Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently. He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute. One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence. Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was \\"British and a famous non-rat\\" and avoided conflict \\"by being nice, charming, and eccentric\\". During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro \\"Gerry Lang\\" Langella (Colombo crime family); James \\"Jimmy C\\" Coonan, John \\"Johnny Carnegs\\" Carneglia, Vittorio \\"Little Vic\\" Amuso, and Frank \\"Frankie Loc\\" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony \\"Bruno\\" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family). He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club. Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff. During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction. He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence. In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams. He was released in April 1995. Life after release Acting He acted in gangster film Killer Bitch (2010), starred in the film I Know You Know (2009), appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series, and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999). He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka \\"Stoner Express\\") (2016). Advocacy and politics  Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis. He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote. This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011. He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show. The Dutch Cannabis Seedbank Sensi Seeds dedicated their strain Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant to Marks for his advocacy work. His close links to the likes of Gruff Rhys led to Marks being associated with the radical changes of the Cool Cymru movement and the changing face of modern Wales. Books Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr. Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages. He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001) and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Se√±or Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America. Se√±or Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan. In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil. His final book \\"Mr Smiley, My Last Pill and Testament\\" was published in 2015 by Pan Macmillan. Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis. Comics and videogame Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game. Music In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks. He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album Fuzzy Logic (released May 1996) and on their singles \\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\\" and \\"Ice Hockey Hair\\". He featured on the album Angel Headed Hip Hop (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx. He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu, and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011), Beautiful Days, RockNess, Camp Bestival, Kendal Calling, and the Sonisphere Festival. He was featured on the Reverend & The Makers track \\"MDMAzing\\" on their third album @Reverend Makers (2012). Works about Marks Marks was the subject of the biography High Time (1984) written by David Leigh. Marks was also the subject of the film Mr. Nice (2010), named after his 1997 autobiography. The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chlo√´ Sevigny as his wife Judy. In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series Banged Up Abroad. Death On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer. He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.

He was born in Weimar, the illegitimate child of Johanna Carolina Dorothea Bechstein and Hubert Dupontreau, a French emigrant who disappeared before the birth of the child; Ludwig thus grew up very poor in his first nine years. His situation improved only when his uncle Johann Matth√§us Bechstein, a renowned naturalist and forester living in Meiningen in the country of Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, adopted him in 1810. He was sent to school in Meiningen, and in 1818, started an apprenticeship as a pharmacist. From 1828 to 1831 he studied philosophy and literature in Leipzig and Munich thanks to a stipend granted by Duke Bernhard II of Sachsen-Meiningen, who hired him subsequently as a librarian. This lifetime post provided Bechstein with a continuous income, while leaving him a lot of freedom to pursue his own interests and writing. He lived from 1831 until his death in Meiningen. In his honor, a fountain was built in the English Garden. Bechstein published many works and was a successful author of his time. His German Fairy Tale Book was even more popular than the Brothers Grimm's collection when it was first published in 1845.

Dryland farming is associated with drylands, areas characterized by a cool wet season (which charges the soil with virtually all the moisture that the crops will receive prior to harvest) followed by a warm dry season. They are also associated with arid conditions, areas prone to drought and those having scarce water-resources.  Process  Dryland farming caused a large dust storm in parts of Eastern Washington on October 4, 2009. Courtesy: NASA/GSFC, MODIS Rapid Response Dryland farming has evolved as a set of techniques and management practices used by farmers to continually adapt to the presence or lack of moisture in a given crop cycle. In marginal regions, a farmer should be financially able to survive occasional crop failures, perhaps for several years in succession. Survival as a dryland farmer requires careful husbandry of the moisture available for the crop and aggressive management of expenses to minimize losses in poor years. Dryland farming involves the constant assessing of the amount of moisture present or lacking for any given crop cycle and planning accordingly. Dryland farmers know that to be financially successful they have to be aggressive during the good years in order to offset the dry years. Dryland farming is dependent on natural rainfall, which can leave the ground vulnerable to dust storms, particularly if poor farming techniques are used or if the storms strike at a particularly vulnerable time. The fact that a fallow period must be included in the crop rotation means that fields cannot always be protected by a cover crop, which might otherwise offer protection against erosion. Some of the theories of dryland farming developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries claimed to be scientific but were in reality pseudoscientific and did not stand up to empirical testing. For example, it was alleged that tillage would seal in moisture, but such \\"dust mulching\\" ideas are based on what people imagine should happen, or have been told, rather than what testing actually confirms. The book Bad Land: An American Romance explores the effects that this had on people who were encouraged to homestead in an area with little rainfall; most smallholdings failed after working miserably to cling on. Dry farming depends on making the best use of the \\"bank\\" of soil moisture that was created by winter rainfall. Some dry farming practices include: * Wider than normal spacing, to provide a larger bank of moisture for each plant. * Controlled Traffic. * Minimal tilling of land. * Strict weed control, to ensure that weeds do not consume soil moisture needed by the cultivated plants. * Cultivation of soil to produce a \\"dust mulch\\", thought to prevent the loss of water through capillary action. This practice is controversial, and is not universally advocated. * Selection of crops and cultivars suited for dry farming practices.  Locations  Wheat Dryland Farming in Behbahan, Iran Dry farming may be practiced in areas that have significant annual rainfall during a wet season, often in the winter. Crops are cultivated during the subsequent dry season, using practices that make use of the stored moisture in the soil. California, Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming, in the United States, are a few states where dry farming is practiced for a variety of crops. Dryland farming is used in the Great Plains, the Palouse plateau of Eastern Washington, and other arid regions of North America such as in the Southwestern United States and Mexico (see Agriculture in the Southwestern United States and Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest), the Middle East and in other grain growing regions such as the steppes of Eurasia and Argentina. Dryland farming was introduced to southern Russia and Ukraine by Ukrainian Mennonites under the influence of Johann Cornies, making the region the breadbasket of Europe. In Australia, it is widely practiced in all states but the Northern Territory.  Crops  Fields in the Palouse, Washington State Dry farmed crops may include grapes, tomatoes, pumpkins, beans, and other summer crops. These crops grow using the winter water stored in the soil, rather than depending on rainfall during the growing season. Dryland farmed crops may include winter wheat, maize, beans, sunflowers or even watermelon. Successful dryland farming is possible with as little as of precipitation a year; higher rainfall increases the variety of crops. Native American tribes in the arid Southwest survived for thousands of years on dryland farming in areas with less than of rain. The choice of crop is influenced by the timing of the predominant rainfall in relation to the seasons. For example, winter wheat is more suited to regions with higher winter rainfall while areas with summer wet seasons may be more suited to summer growing crops such as sorghum, sunflowers or cotton.  Other considerations  ; Capturing and conservation of moisture: In regions such as Eastern Washington, the average annual precipitation available to a dryland farm may be as little as . In the Horse Heaven Hills in central Washington, wheat farming has been productive purportedly on an average annual rainfall approaching 6 inches. Consequently, moisture must be captured until the crop can utilize it. Techniques include summer fallow rotation (in which one crop is grown on two seasons' precipitation, leaving standing stubble and crop residue to trap snow), and preventing runoff by terracing fields. \\"Terracing\\" is also practiced by farmers on a smaller scale by laying out the direction of furrows to slow water runoff downhill, usually by plowing along either contours or keylines. Moisture can be conserved by eliminating weeds and leaving crop residue to shade the soil. ; Effective use of available moisture: Once moisture is available for the crop to use, it must be used as effectively as possible. Seed planting depth and timing are carefully considered to place the seed at a depth at which sufficient moisture exists, or where it will exist when seasonal precipitation falls. Farmers tend to use crop varieties which are drought-tolerant and heat-stress tolerant (even lower-yielding varieties). Thus the likelihood of a successful crop is hedged if seasonal precipitation fails. ; Soil conservation: The nature of dryland farming makes it particularly susceptible to erosion, especially wind erosion. Some techniques for conserving soil moisture (such as frequent tillage to kill weeds) are at odds with techniques for conserving topsoil. Since healthy topsoil is critical to sustainable agriculture, in particular within arid areas, its preservation is generally considered the most important long-term goal of a dryland farming operation. Erosion control techniques such as windbreaks, reduced tillage or no-till, spreading straw (or other mulch on particularly susceptible ground), and strip farming are used to minimize topsoil loss. ; Control of input costs: Dryland farming is practiced in regions inherently marginal for non-irrigated agriculture. Because of this, there is an increased risk of crop failure and poor yields which may occur in a dry year (regardless of money or effort expended). Dryland farmers must evaluate the potential yield of a crop constantly throughout the growing season and be prepared to decrease inputs to the crop such as fertilizer and weed control if it appears that it is likely to have a poor yield due to insufficient moisture. Conversely, in years when moisture is abundant, farmers may increase their input efforts and budget to maximize yields and to offset poor harvests.  Arid-zone agriculture  An example of a dryland farming paddock As an area of research and development, arid-zone agriculture, or desert agriculture, includes studies of how to increase the agricultural productivity of lands dominated by lack of freshwater, an abundance of heat and sunlight, and usually one or more of: Extreme winter cold, short rainy season, saline soil or water, strong dry winds, poor soil structure, over- grazing, limited technological development, poverty, or political instabilitY. The two basic approaches are: * View the given environmental and socioeconomic characteristics as negative obstacles to be overcome. * View as many as possible of them as positive resources to be used.

Bevilaqua, American Helicopter Society 53rd Annual Forum, Virginia Beach, April 29-May 1, 1997. Fig. 6 Turbine Performance Map The ground test demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The engine fan and core from the F100-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the \\"F100-229-Plus\\" demonstrator engine. This engine proved the lift-fan concept and led to the development of the current F135 engine. The F135 team is made up of Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Hamilton Sundstrand. Pratt & Whitney is the prime contractor for the main engine, and systems integration. Rolls-Royce is responsible for the vertical lift system for the STOVL aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is responsible for the electronic engine control system, actuation system, PMAG, gearbox, and health monitoring systems. Woodward, Inc. is responsible for the fuel system.

The F135 is assembled at a plant in Middletown, Connecticut. Some parts of the engine are made in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, and in Poland.

The initial F-35s went into production with the F135 engines, but the GE/Rolls-Royce team planned to develop a replacement F136 engine in July 2009. In 2010, the Pentagon planned for the two propulsion systems to be competitively tendered. However, since 2006 the Defense Department has not requested funding for the alternate F136 engine program, but Congress has maintained program funding.Trimble, Stephen. \\"US Senate axes F-35 alternate engine\\". Flightglobal.com, 23 July 2009. An F135-PW-100 powerplant being tested at AEDC As of 2009, P&W; developed a more durable version of the F135 engine to increase the service life of key parts. The life expectancy of the parts was reduced because the hot sections of the engine (combustor and high-pressure turbine blades specifically) ran hotter than expected. The test engine is designated XTE68/LF1, and testing is expected to begin in 2010.Harrington, Caitlin. (2009) \\"Pratt & Whitney starts development of new F-35 test engine\\". Jane's Defence Weekly, March 27, 2009. This redesign has caused ‚Äúsubstantial cost growth.‚Äù P&W; expects to deliver the F135 below the cost of the F119, even though it is a more powerful engine.Graham Warwick, Amy Butler \\"Pentagon Ramps Up Pressure On F-35 Price.\\" Aviation Week, 3 December 2010. However, in February 2013 a cracked turbine blade was found during a scheduled inspection. The crack was caused by operating at high turbine temperatures for longer periods than usual. In December 2013 the hollow first stage fan blisk failed at 77% of its expected life during a ground test. It will be replaced by a solid part adding in weight. In 2013, a former P&W; employee was caught attempting to ship \\"numerous boxes\\" of sensitive information about the F135 to Iran. Despite the troubles, the 100th engine was delivered in 2013. LRIP-6 was agreed in 2013 for $1.1 billion for 38 engines of various types, which helped to decrease the unit cost. Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher C. Bogdan, the executive officer of the F-35 program, has called out P&W; for falling short on manufacturing quality of the engines and slow deliveries. His deputy director Rear Admiral Randy Mahr said that P&W; stopped their cost-cutting efforts after \\"they got the monopoly\\". In 2013 the price of the F135 increased by $4.3 billion. In May 2014, Pratt & Whitney discovered conflicting documentation about the origin of titanium material used in some of its engines, including the F135. The company assessed that the uncertainty did not pose a risk to safety of flight but suspended engine deliveries as a result. Bogdan supported P&W;'s actions and said the problem was now with A&P; Alloys, the supplier. The US Defense Contract Management Agency wrote in June 2014 that Pratt & Whitney's \\"continued poor management of suppliers is a primary driver for the increased potential problem notifications.\\" A&P; Alloys stated that they stood behind their product even though they were not given access to the parts to do their own testing. Tracy Miner, an attorney with Boston-based Demeo LLP representing A&P; Alloys said, \\"it is blatantly unfair to destroy A&P;‚Äôs business without allowing A&P; access to the materials in question\\" In July 2014 there was an uncontained failure of a fan rotor while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before the flight, flexing of the engine caused excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator initiating the impending failure. The rub caused a temperature of over 1,000 ¬∞C (1,900 ¬∞F), well beyond the material limit of 540 ¬∞C (1,000 ¬∞F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured the fuel cell and hot air mixing with jet fuel caused the fire.Sweetman, Bill, Butler Amy, and Guy Norris, There's the rub, Aviation Week & Space Technology, September 8, 2014, pp.22-23 As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing. Pratt & Whitney managed to meet their 2015 production goals, but \\"recurring manufacturing quality issues\\" in turbine blades and electronic control systems required engines to be pulled from the fleet. Design Thrust vectoring nozzle of the F135-PW-600 STOVL variant F-35B and smaller powered lift aircraft Derived from the F119 engine, the F135 is a mixed-flow afterburning turbofan with a new fan and LP turbine. There are 2 F135 variants: the -100 engine and the -600 engine. Other sources mention a -400 engine, similar to the -100, the major difference being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials.\\"The Pratt & Whitney F135\\". Jane's Aero Engines. Jane's Information Group, 2009 (subscription version, dated 10 July 2009). The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering. The engine and Rolls-Royce LiftSystem make up the Integrated Lift Fan Propulsion System (ILFPS). The lift for the STOVL version in the hover is obtained from a 2-stage lift fan (about 46%) in front of the engine, a vectoring exhaust nozzle (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using fan air from the bypass duct (about 8%). These relative contributions to the total lift are based on thrust values of 18,680 lb, 18,680 lb and 3,290 lb respectively. Another source gives thrust values of 20,000 lb, 18,000 lb and 3,900 lb respectively. In this configuration most of the bypass flow is ducted to the wing nozzles, known as roll posts. Some is used for cooling the rear exhaust nozzle, known as the 3-bearing swivel duct nozzle (3BSD). At the same time an auxiliary inlet is opened on top of the aircraft to provide additional air to the engine with low distortion during the hover. The LP turbine drives the lift fan through a shaft extension on the front of the LP rotor and a clutch. The engine operates as a separate flow turbofan with a higher bypass ratio.\\"Genesis of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter\\" Paul M. Bevilaqua, 2009 Wright Brothers Lecture, Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 46, No. 6, November‚ÄìDecember 2009 The power to drive the fan (about 30,000 SHP) is obtained from the LP turbine by increasing the hot nozzle area. A higher bypass ratio increases the thrust for the same engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one.\\"V/STOL by Vertifan\\" William T. Immenschuh, Flight International, 1 October 1964 When the F135 is in the hover using the significantly increased bypass ratio from the liftfan, the thrust augmentation is 50% with no increase in fuel flow. Thrust augmentation is 52% in conventional flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow. The transfer of approximately \\"The Shaft Driven Lift Fan Propulsion System for the Joint Strike Fighter\\" Paul M. Bevilaqua, American Helicopter Society 53rd Annual Forum, Virginia Beach, April 29-May 1, 1997 of the power available for hot nozzle thrust to the lift fan reduces the temperature and velocity of the rear lift jet impinging on the ground. The F-35 can achieve a limited 100% throttle cruise without afterburners of Mach 1.2 for 150 miles. Like the F119, the F135 has a stealthy augmentor where traditional spray bars and flameholders are replaced by thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar- absorbent materials (RAM). Afterburner fuel injectors are integrated into these vanes, which block line-of-sight of the turbines, contributing to aft- sector stealth. The axisymmetric nozzle consists of fifteen partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge. This creates shed vortices and reduces the infrared signature of the exhaust plume. The effectiveness is reportedly comparable to that of the F119's wedge nozzles, while being substantially more cost effective and lower maintenance. The engine uses thermoelectric-powered sensors to monitor turbine bearing health.Swedberg, Claire. \\"Energy-Harvesting Sensors to Monitor Health of Jet Engines\\". RFID Journal, 31 May 2011. Improving engine reliability and ease of maintenance is a major objective for the F135. The engine has fewer parts than similar engines, which improves reliability. All line-replaceable components (LRCs) can be removed and replaced with a set of six common hand tools. The F135's health management system is designed to provide real time data to maintainers on the ground. This allows them to troubleshoot problems and prepare replacement parts before the aircraft returns to base. According to Pratt & Whitney, this data may help drastically reduce troubleshooting and replacement time, as much as 94% over legacy engines.Rajagopalan, R., Wood, B., Schryver, M. (2003).

AIAA 2003-2645. Planned improvements Although no service has issued a requirement for an upgraded engine, Pratt and Whitney is cooperating with the US Navy on a two-block improvement plan for the F135 engine. The goals of Block 1 are a 7‚Äì10% increase in thrust and a 5‚Äì7% lower fuel burn. The plans include better cooling technology for turbine blades; this would increase the longevity of the engine and substantially reduce maintenance costs. The goal of Block 2 is to work with the US Air Force's Adaptive Engine Transition Program, with the intention of introducing technology for an engine rated at 45,000 lb of thrust, to be used in a sixth-generation fighter.Norris, Guy, Power plan, Aviation Week & Space Technology, April 13‚Äì26, 2015, p.26 =Growth Options= GO1 At the end of May 2017 Pratt and Whitney announced the F135 Growth Option 1 had finished testing and was available for production. The upgrade requires the changing of the power module on older engines and can be seamlessly inserted into future production engines at a minimal increase in unit cost and no impact to delivery schedule. The Growth Option 1 offers an improvement of 6-10% thrust across the F-35 flight envelope while also getting a 5-6% fuel burn reduction. GO2 In June 2018, United Technologies, parent company of P&W;, announced Growth Option 2.0 to help provide increased power and thermal management system (PTMS) capacity, providing options for operators for instance if they are wishing to upgrade to heavier weapons.Pratt & Whitney launches Growth Option 2.0 upgrade for F135 engine, Air Force Technology, 2018-06-14 Variants * F135-PW-100 : Used in the F-35A Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant * F135-PW-400 : Used in the F-35C naval variant built with salt-corrosion resistant materials * F135-PW-600 : Used in the F-35B Short Take-Off Vertical Landing variant Applications * Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Specifications (F135) F135-PW-100 F135-PW-600 See also References ;Bibliography * * Jane's Information Group.

Since its formation the band has included guitarist and vocalist James Walsh, drummer Ben Byrne, bassist James Stelfox and keyboardist Barry Westhead. They are best known for their 2003 single \\"Silence Is Easy\\" which reached number 9 in the UK. The band has released five studio albums, and have scored ten Top 40 hit singles in the UK. Their first album Love Is Here was released in 2001, followed by Silence Is Easy (2003) and On the Outside (2005). After the release of its fourth album All the Plans (2009), the band entered into extended hiatus until 2014, during which its members were involved in individual projects. Starsailor announced their reunion on 23 May 2014 and began performing worldwide. Good Souls: The Greatest Hits was released in September 2015, and featured two new songs. A fifth studio album All This Life was released in 2017. History Formation, signed by EMI (1999‚Äì2000) Despite being known as a Wigan band, only one member of Starsailor is actually from the town. The band met whilst studying Music at the Parsons Walk Campus of Wigan and Leigh College. Bassist James Stelfox and drummer Ben Byrne had been playing together in Warrington, Cheshire for a number of years. When their regular singer fell ill, they recruited young Chorley singer and songwriter James Walsh from a school choir. He was influenced by Jeff Buckley and his 1994 album Grace in his singing style. (citation needed) Comparing it to Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album, which Walsh says sums up a unique moment, Grace captures every moment. (citation needed) The band, then named Waterface, had tried a number of guitarists before they asked long-time friend Barry Westhead to join the band in 2000 on keyboards. He had been teaching judo and playing organ for a church near his home town. His arrival has been heralded as the most significant event in the band's formation. Walsh also took up the guitar, following frustration over not finding a musician right for the group. The band started to build up a reputation, and their name changed to Starsailor after the 1970 album Starsailor by Tim Buckley. A journalist from NME saw a gig in 2000 and gave the band a glowing review. \\"One live encounter was enough to convince many sceptics that here was a band who were genuinely special, blessed with a singer whose voice thrummed like an emotional telegraph wire, that swerved the pitfalls of indie melancholia and were clearly in love with rock 'n' roll and all its possibilities.\\" Their performance at the Glastonbury Festival added to the band's reputation and led to a bidding war amongst UK record companies. The band signed with EMI, the label that a relative of one band member worked for, in 2000. In 2008, in a re-organisation, Starsailor were moved to Virgin Records, a division of EMI.Starsailor Message Board :: View topic ‚Äì 4th album Album Thread: Hear \\"Hurts Too Much\\" RIGHT NOW! Rock in Rio Lisbon 2006  Love Is Here, critical acclaim (2000‚Äì2002)  \\"Fever\\", the band's first single, was released in early 2001. The song, and its two B-Sides \\"Love Is Here\\" and \\"Coming Down\\" were cut from a demo recording session in mid-2000. All three tracks went on to feature on Starsailor's first album Love Is Here, but were re-recorded. In March 2001 the band sold out its first UK Tour, which consisted of eleven dates in England. Their second single, \\"Good Souls\\", was released in April and featured a cover of Van Morrison's \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\" as a B-Side. During this period, the band were recording their debut album in Rockfield Studios, Wales. By this time, the band were already previewing many of the album's tracks in their concerts, most notably \\"Poor Misguided Fool\\", \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Way To Fall\\", which would appear as the ending theme of the video game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater in 2004. An acoustic version of \\"Alcoholic\\" appeared on a promotional CD for NME magazine earlier in 2001. The original release date for the album was August 2001. Further live dates came supporting the Manic Street Preachers in Glasgow, as well as Doves on their North American tour. The band also marked their first festival appearances, playing at events such as V Festival\\"LIVE: V2001 FESTIVAL\\". Chart Attack, August 24, 2001. Review By Frank Walshe and Germany's Rock im Park. \\"Alcoholic\\" appeared as the third single to be taken off their debut album, and its number ten chart position remains the band's second highest placing to date. The single version was actually an extended version of the album track. Their album Love Is Here reached number 2 in the UK album charts in October 2001, after receiving great critical acclaim. Combining a mix of acoustic guitar and Walsh's vocals, critics said the songs leave the \\"hairs on the back of your neck standing.\\" The year ended with the band winning the \\"Brightest New Hope\\" award at the NME Awards, and the release of their fourth single, \\"Lullaby\\", which reached number thirty-six. Some fans complained about the difficulty in obtaining copies of the single. Peter Kay joined the band on stage at their 2002 Christmas Concert held in Warrington's Parr Hall. James Walsh Silence Is Easy (2002‚Äì2005) For their second album, Silence Is Easy, which was recorded in Los Angeles, Starsailor teamed up with Phil Spector. The collaboration came about following Spector's daughter Nicole attending one of the band's American concerts in the winter of 2002. Spector was reported to have been fascinated by \\"Lullaby\\", the band's fourth single. After meeting the producer, the band agreed to work with him on their second album. However, the collaboration was short-lived; sessions at London's Abbey Road proved difficult. Spector is said to have dismissed Ben Byrne's drumming, and proved difficult to work with. Only two tracks made the band's second album: the title track, \\"Silence Is Easy\\", and \\"White Dove\\". The band co- produced seven of the other tracks with Danton Supple and former The Stone Roses and Radiohead producer John Leckie was brought in to oversee the recording of \\"Shark Food\\". The first single was \\"Silence Is Easy\\", which made the Top Ten (No. 9, the band's highest placing). The album spawned just three singles; the second of which, \\"Born Again\\" had evolved from a B-side to \\"Poor Misguided Fool\\", released in early 2002. The song was re-recorded for the album, and cut down for a radio edit. \\"Four to the Floor\\", which was remixed by Thin White Duke, became a popular club hit. Walsh wanted the track to become the band's \\"I Am the Resurrection\\", something to be played in \\"indie discos everywhere\\". The album charted well, but sales were sluggish in comparison to the band's first album. The release dropped out of the Top 40 soon thereafter. A full UK tour began in autumn 2003 shortly after the release of the album, culminating at London's Brixton Academy. The show featured the only performance before their American tour in 2006 of \\"Restless Heart\\", the closing track on the Silence Is Easy album. Mark Collins, from The Charlatans joined Starsailor for all dates between August 2003 to December 2004, playing additional and lead guitar. On the Outside, return to form (2005‚Äì2007) EMI allowed the band plenty of time to record their follow-up album; having targeted producer Rob Schnapf to produce it, the group relocated to Los Angeles to record. Five possible titles appeared; (\\"Faith, Hope, Love\\"/\\"Here I Go\\"/\\"Ashes\\" or \\"In the Crossfire\\"/\\"I Do Not Know\\"/\\"Counterfeit Life\\"), but the band settled for On the Outside, a statement of their position in the music industry. The sound was different from the previous two releases; it was far heavier than its predecessors. Starsailor had always received praise for their live sound, but the releases seemed \\"puny\\" in comparison, admitted Stelfox. The recording was all done to tape, and the band did not use editing software such as Pro Tools to \\"perfect\\" the recording. Byrne later remarked that his drum track on \\"White Light\\" took a long time to nail; highlighting the band's desire to make the record they were truly happy with. Starsailor released their third album, On the Outside, in the UK on 17 October 2005 from which the first single from the album, \\"In the Crossfire\\" was taken. It was released by Artists Addiction Records in the USA on 22 August. Critics raved about the release, with many citing it as a return to form. Despite this, promotional appearances including a short live set and signing at London's HMV Oxford Street did not aid sales ‚Äì the album charted at number 13. Since September 2005, Richard Warren joined the band when playing live, aiding Walsh with additional guitar, vocals and also harmonica parts. Again, the band's UK tour ended at Brixton Academy. Following that, the band toured Europe, playing several dates in France, where \\"Four to the Floor\\" was a number one hit in 2004. Following the Paris concert on 3 April, Walsh and Warren were the DJ's at the after-show party. The album has spawned three singles; \\"This Time\\" and \\"Keep Us Together\\" followed \\"In The Crossfire\\". Despite promoting the single with appearances in London and Leeds, \\"Keep Us Together\\" was the first single not to reach the UK Top 40. The promotional video for \\"This Time\\" appears to be a cultural reference to the film Run Lola Run, but may not be intentional. Starsailor played numerous festivals in the Summer of 2006; most notably \\"Hyde Park Calling\\" on 1 July 2006, alongside Roger Waters, and the V Festival, which is held in Stafford and Chelmsford. They also supported the Rolling Stones on their \\"Bigger Bang\\" Tour in Munich, Hamburg in 2006 and again in Frankfurt, Paris and Lyon in 2007. In the autumn of 2006, Starsailor toured North America, playing both headlining shows and supporting James Blunt, in January 2007 they undertook their first trip to Russia, playing in the B2 Club of Moscow. According to the band's official website Barry Westhead's partner Kelly gave birth to a baby boy on 12 April 2007. The baby was named Joseph. Bass player James Stelfox became a father again in 2008, when his partner gave birth to a girl, named Ella, in November while the rest of the band were doing their first trip to Korea. Starsailor was named the replacement for Amy Winehouse as the support act for The Rolling Stones on the German leg of their tour. They were opening for the rock legends for the first time in Hamburg. Front man James Walsh told BBC 6 Music: \\"We heard on Sunday evening, our agent gave us a frantic call, and asked what we were doing this week, fortunately we had a week off!\\" All the Plans, beginning of hiatus (2007‚Äì2009) In 2007, Starsailor began recording demos for the follow-up to 2005's On the Outside. Starsailor started to play in various gigs during the months recording their fourth album. James Walsh also played at several events in 2007, like the SXSW festival in Texas in March 2007, and an acoustic show in London on 12 March. The show is notable for not having a set list; rarities such as the hardly played \\"Restless Heart\\" was played, due to a request from the front row. In addition to this he played the song \\"Tell Me It's Not Over\\", the track from the work-in-progress fourth album (early arrivals saw Walsh sound check half the song). Walsh and Stelfox played an unplugged set on 13 April 2007 in Switzerland with Mark Collins of The Charlatans. Further support in Europe for The Rolling Stones took place in mid-June; these were late additions, and fitted in with the band's festival schedule. The previous concert before the Stones' support was in Den Haag, the Netherlands; the band debuted the first full-band version of \\"Tell Me It's Not Over\\". Starsailor had embarked on a tour of the UK during October 2007 in support of Fairtrade. They have debuted a number of new songs during the tour as \\"Boy in Waiting\\" and \\"All the Plans\\". The lyrics for \\"Tell Me It's Not Over\\" had changed considerably since the first time they had sung it. Their first travel to Latin America was confirmed after a long period of speculation. Starsailor supported The Killers on November 2007 on their dates in Argentina and Chile. Starsailor played on June at the Isle of Wight Festival on the last day, with The Police headlining on that date. They also performed at Hard Rock Calling in Hyde Park the same month with The Police as headliners. They also confirmed that they would play at \\"Rockin\\" Park' in the Netherlands on Saturday 28 June, on the third day of the 2008 Cactus Festival at Minnewaterpark, Brugge, Belgium on Saturday 12 July, and the Open Air Gampel Festival in Switzerland on Saturday 16 August. On 20 March 2008, front man James posted on the official Starsailor forum announcing the album had been completed.Starsailor Message Board :: View topic ‚Äì Finally finished recording our 4th album On 16 October 2008 it was officially confirmed that the new album would be called All the Plans and was to be released in March 2009.Boo.Starsailor Message Board :: View topic ‚Äì 4th album release details; All the Plans ‚Äì March 2009 Accessed 22 October 2008 On 3 December, the Boy in Waiting EP was released as a free digital download for those who pre-order the deluxe edition of All the Plans. It contained three tracks that did not make the album. The album debuted at Number 26 in the UK Album Charts on 14 March 2009, while \\"Tell Me It's Not Over\\" spent one week in the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 73, and peaking at No. 5 in the Belgian Charts, becoming Starsailor's most successful single in that country. On 26 April 2009, the band performed at The Tavern pub in Wigan, as part of Channel 4 television's \\"Grassroot Gigs\\" series. They had never played a concert in the town before, and have played there only once since then. Lead singer, James Walsh began to work on a solo project at the end of 2009. On 13 November 2009 it was officially announced by The Lancashire Evening Post that Starsailor was on hold and that James Walsh was concentrating on his solo career. Reunion, touring and Greatest Hits album (2014‚Äì2015) Starsailor have reformed, playing support slots at Summer in the City festival in 10 and 11 July at Castlefield Bowl, headlined by Pixies and James. Starsailor performed on Rock Zottegem festival in Belgium on 14 July 2014. On 3 August 2014 the band performed at the Pentaport Rock Festival held in Incheon, South Korea. Their support tour continued in November 2014, supporting them in England at venues like Parr Hall, National Indoor Arena and Royal Albert Hall. They are set to return to the stage in June 2015, when they will co-headline several concerts with Embrace in the USA. Starsailor's first greatest hits album, called Good Souls: The Greatest Hits, was released on 18 September 2015. The album contained 19 tracks, including all of band's singles to date and two brand new songs \\"Give Up the Ghost\\" and \\"Hold on\\", recorded with producer Harry Rutherford.  All This Life (2017‚Äìpresent)  In 2017, the band released \\"Listen To Your Heart\\", their first release in almost two years. Their fifth album, All This Life, was released on 1 September 2017 through the band's new record label, Cooking Vinyl. Flick of the Finger gave the album an overwhelmingly positive 5 star review, with the publication praising the song \\"Sunday Best\\", saying that 'the album is best summarised by this one melancholic and emotional track.' The album entered the UK album chart at No. 23. Charity The band played the London Astoria on 4 and 8 February 2002. The first date was a concert in aid of Warchild, and also included Travis and Ryan Adams on the bill. The 8th saw the debut of \\"Born Again\\", which would eventually be released as a single. The concert is notable since the band were joined on stage by two backing singers and a cellist. James Walsh told NME.COM after the show that he thought the gig was \\"amazing, something really special\\" while bassist James Stelfox said it was \\"one of the greatest ever.\\" This flirtation with these additional voices and a cello only lasted a brief period of time. On 19 September 2008 Starsailor performed in the second edition of the \\"Stars of Europe\\" concert at Brussels in support of UNICEF, where they covered U2's single \\"All I Want Is You\\" On 20 May 2009, the band was named Hard Rock's \\"Philanthropic Artist of the Year\\" in recognition of the work they'd done in support of the Caron Keating Foundation, the AECC of Barcelona and Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy, as well as having contributed an exclusive cover of Graham Nash's \\"Military Madness\\" to the World Hunger Year Serve3 charity album.

The designation E8 comes from the Cartan‚ÄìKilling classification of the complex simple Lie algebras, which fall into four infinite series labeled An, Bn, Cn, Dn, and five exceptional cases labeled E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. The E8 algebra is the largest and most complicated of these exceptional cases.  Basic description  The Lie group E8 has dimension 248. Its rank, which is the dimension of its maximal torus, is eight (8). Therefore, the vectors of the root system are in eight-dimensional Euclidean space: they are described explicitly later in this article. The Weyl group of E8, which is the group of symmetries of the maximal torus which are induced by conjugations in the whole group, has order 2357 = . The compact group E8 is unique among simple compact Lie groups in that its non-trivial representation of smallest dimension is the adjoint representation (of dimension 248) acting on the Lie algebra E8 itself; it is also the unique one which has the following four properties: trivial center, compact, simply connected, and simply laced (all roots have the same length). There is a Lie algebra Ek for every integer k ‚â• 3\\\\. The largest value of k for which Ek is finite-dimensional is k=8, that is, Ek is infinite- dimensional for any k > 8\\\\.  Real and complex forms  There is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E8, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 248. The complex Lie group E8 of complex dimension 248 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 496. This is simply connected, has maximal compact subgroup the compact form (see below) of E8, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation. As well as the complex Lie group of type E8, there are three real forms of the Lie algebra, three real forms of the group with trivial center (two of which have non-algebraic double covers, giving two further real forms), all of real dimension 248, as follows: * The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which is simply connected and has trivial outer automorphism group. * The split form, EVIII (or E8(8)), which has maximal compact subgroup Spin(16)/(Z/2Z), fundamental group of order 2 (implying that it has a double cover, which is a simply connected Lie real group but is not algebraic, see below) and has trivial outer automorphism group. * EIX (or E8(‚àí24)), which has maximal compact subgroup E7√óSU(2)/(‚àí1,‚àí1), fundamental group of order 2 (again implying a double cover, which is not algebraic) and has trivial outer automorphism group. For a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the list of simple Lie groups.  E8 as an algebraic group  By means of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra, one can define E8 as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù) form of E8. Over an algebraically closed field, this is the only form; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or ‚Äútwists‚Äù of E8, which are classified in the general framework of Galois cohomology (over a perfect field k) by the set H1(k,Aut(E8)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E8 (see below) has no automorphisms, coincides with H1(k,E8). (English translation: ), ¬ß2.2.4 Over R, the real connected component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E8 coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned above, but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all forms of E8 are simply connected in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit no non-trivial algebraic coverings; the non-compact and simply connected real Lie group forms of E8 are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations. Over finite fields, the Lang‚ÄìSteinberg theorem implies that H1(k,E8)=0, meaning that E8 has no twisted forms: see below. The characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula. The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are : : 1, 248, 3875, 27000, 30380, 147250, 779247, 1763125, 2450240, 4096000, 4881384, 6696000, 26411008, 70680000, 76271625, 79143000, 146325270, 203205000, 281545875, 301694976, 344452500, 820260000, 1094951000, 2172667860, 2275896000, 2642777280, 2903770000, 3929713760, 4076399250, 4825673125, 6899079264, 8634368000 (twice), 12692520960‚Ä¶ The 248-dimensional representation is the adjoint representation. There are two non-isomorphic irreducible representations of dimension 8634368000 (it is not unique; however, the next integer with this property is 175898504162692612600853299200000 ). The fundamental representations are those with dimensions 3875, 6696000, 6899079264, 146325270, 2450240, 30380, 248 and 147250 (corresponding to the eight nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order chosen for the Cartan matrix below, i.e., the nodes are read in the seven-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third). The coefficients of the character formulas for infinite dimensional irreducible representations of E8 depend on some large square matrices consisting of polynomials, the Lusztig‚ÄìVogan polynomials, an analogue of Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials introduced for reductive groups in general by George Lusztig and David Kazhdan (1983). The values at 1 of the Lusztig‚ÄìVogan polynomials give the coefficients of the matrices relating the standard representations (whose characters are easy to describe) with the irreducible representations. These matrices were computed after four years of collaboration by a group of 18 mathematicians and computer scientists, led by Jeffrey Adams, with much of the programming done by Fokko du Cloux. The most difficult case (for exceptional groups) is the split real form of E8 (see above), where the largest matrix is of size 453060√ó453060. The Lusztig‚ÄìVogan polynomials for all other exceptional simple groups have been known for some time; the calculation for the split form of E8 is far longer than any other case. The announcement of the result in March 2007 received extraordinary attention from the media (see the external links), to the surprise of the mathematicians working on it. The representations of the E8 groups over finite fields are given by Deligne‚ÄìLusztig theory.  Constructions  One can construct the (compact form of the) E8 group as the automorphism group of the corresponding e8 Lie algebra. This algebra has a 120-dimensional subalgebra so(16) generated by Jij as well as 128 new generators Qa that transform as a Weyl‚ÄìMajorana spinor of spin(16). These statements determine the commutators : \\\\left[J_{ij}, J_{k\\\\ell}\\\\right] = \\\\delta_{jk}J_{i\\\\ell} - \\\\delta_{j\\\\ell}J_{ik} - \\\\delta_{ik}J_{j\\\\ell} + \\\\delta_{i\\\\ell}J_{jk} as well as : \\\\left[J_{ij}, Q_a\\\\right] = \\\\frac 14 \\\\left(\\\\gamma_i\\\\gamma_j-\\\\gamma_j\\\\gamma_i\\\\right)_{ab} Q_b, while the remaining commutators (not anticommutators!) between the spinor generators are defined as : \\\\left[Q_a, Q_b\\\\right] = \\\\gamma^{[i}_{ac}\\\\gamma^{j]}_{cb} J_{ij}. It is then possible to check that the Jacobi identity is satisfied.  Geometry  The compact real form of E8 is the isometry group of the 128-dimensional exceptional compact Riemannian symmetric space EVIII (in Cartan's classification). It is known informally as the \\"octooctonionic projective plane\\" because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the octonions with themselves, and is also known as a Rosenfeld projective plane, though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the magic square, due to Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits .  E8 root system  Zome model of the E8 root system, projected into three-space, and represented by the vertices of the 421 polytope, File:4_21_E8_to_3D_H3_symmetry_concentric_hulls.pngthumb300pxShown in 3D projection using the basis vectors [u,v,w] giving H3 symmetry: The projected 421 polytope vertices are sorted and tallied by their 3D norm generating the increasingly transparent hulls of each set of tallied norms. These show: for a total of 240 vertices. This is, of course, 2 concentric sets of hulls from the H4 symmetry of the 600-cell scaled by the golden ratio.The 600-Cell A root system of rank r is a particular finite configuration of vectors, called roots, which span an r-dimensional Euclidean space and satisfy certain geometrical properties. In particular, the root system must be invariant under reflection through the hyperplane perpendicular to any root. The E8 root system is a rank 8 root system containing 240 root vectors spanning R8. It is irreducible in the sense that it cannot be built from root systems of smaller rank. All the root vectors in E8 have the same length. It is convenient for a number of purposes to normalize them to have length . These 240 vectors are the vertices of a semi-regular polytope discovered by Thorold Gosset in 1900, sometimes known as the 421 polytope. Construction In the so-called even coordinate system, E8 is given as the set of all vectors in R8 with length squared equal to 2 such that coordinates are either all integers or all half- integers and the sum of the coordinates is even. Explicitly, there are 112 roots with integer entries obtained from : \\\\left(\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,0,0,0,0,0,0\\\\right)\\\\, by taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary permutation of coordinates, and 128 roots with half-integer entries obtained from : \\\\left(\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12,\\\\pm\\\\tfrac12\\\\right) \\\\, by taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be even). There are 240 roots in all. E8 2d projection with thread made by hand The 112 roots with integer entries form a D8 root system. The E8 root system also contains a copy of A8 (which has 72 roots) as well as E6 and E7 (in fact, the latter two are usually defined as subsets of E8). In the odd coordinate system, E8 is given by taking the roots in the even coordinate system and changing the sign of any one coordinate. The roots with integer entries are the same while those with half-integer entries have an odd number of minus signs rather than an even number. Dynkin diagram The Dynkin diagram for E8 is given by 120px. This diagram gives a concise visual summary of the root structure. Each node of this diagram represents a simple root. A line joining two simple roots indicates that they are at an angle of 120¬∞ to each other. Two simple roots which are not joined by a line are orthogonal. Cartan matrix The Cartan matrix of a rank root system is an matrix whose entries are derived from the simple roots. Specifically, the entries of the Cartan matrix are given by : A_{ij} = 2\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_i, \\\\alpha_j\\\\right)}{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_i, \\\\alpha_i\\\\right)} where is the Euclidean inner product and are the simple roots. The entries are independent of the choice of simple roots (up to ordering). The Cartan matrix for E8 is given by : \\\\left [ \\\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1& 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right ]. The determinant of this matrix is equal to 1. Simple roots Hasse diagram of E8 root poset with edge labels identifying added simple root position. A set of simple roots for a root system Œ¶ is a set of roots that form a basis for the Euclidean space spanned by Œ¶ with the special property that each root has components with respect to this basis that are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive. Given the E8 Cartan matrix (above) and a Dynkin diagram node ordering of: 150px One choice of simple roots is given by the rows of the following matrix: : \\\\left [\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1&-1&0&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&1&-1&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&1&-1&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&1&-1&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&-1&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1&1&0 \\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1&-1&0 \\\\ \\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right ]. Weyl group The Weyl group of E8 is of order 696729600, and can be described as O(2): it is of the form 2.G.2 (that is, a stem extension by the cyclic group of order 2 of an extension of the cyclic group of order 2 by a group G) where G is the unique simple group of order 174182400 (which can be described as PSŒ©8+(2)). E8 root lattice The integral span of the E8 root system forms a lattice in R8 naturally called the E8 root lattice. This lattice is rather remarkable in that it is the only (nontrivial) even, unimodular lattice with rank less than 16. Simple subalgebras of E8 An incomplete simple subgroup tree of E8 The Lie algebra E8 contains as subalgebras all the exceptional Lie algebras as well as many other important Lie algebras in mathematics and physics. The height of the Lie algebra on the diagram approximately corresponds to the rank of the algebra. A line from an algebra down to a lower algebra indicates that the lower algebra is a subalgebra of the higher algebra.  Chevalley groups of type E8  showed that the points of the (split) algebraic group E8 (see above) over a finite field with q elements form a finite Chevalley group, generally written E8(q), which is simple for any q, and constitutes one of the infinite families addressed by the classification of finite simple groups. Its number of elements is given by the formula : : q^{120}\\\\left(q^{30} - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^{24} - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^{20} - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^{18} - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^{14} - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^{12} - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^8 - 1\\\\right)\\\\left(q^2 - 1\\\\right) The first term in this sequence, the order of E8(2), namely ‚âà 3.38√ó1074, is already larger than the size of the Monster group. This group E8(2) is the last one described (but without its character table) in the ATLAS of Finite Groups.Conway &al, op. cit., p. 235. The Schur multiplier of E8(q) is trivial, and its outer automorphism group is that of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order f if q=pf where p is prime). described the unipotent representations of finite groups of type E8.  Subgroups  The smaller exceptional groups E7 and E6 sit inside E8. In the compact group, both E7√óSU(2)/(‚àí1,‚àí1) and E6√óSU(3)/(Z/3Z) are maximal subgroups of E8. The 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E8 may be considered in terms of its restricted representation to the first of these subgroups. It transforms under E7√óSU(2) as a sum of tensor product representations, which may be labelled as a pair of dimensions as (3,1) + (1,133) + (2,56) (since there is a quotient in the product, these notations may strictly be taken as indicating the infinitesimal (Lie algebra) representations). Since the adjoint representation can be described by the roots together with the generators in the Cartan subalgebra, we may see that decomposition by looking at these. In this description, * (3,1) consists of the roots (0,0,0,0,0,0,1,‚àí1), (0,0,0,0,0,0,‚àí1,1) and the Cartan generator corresponding to the last dimension; * (1,133) consists of all roots with (1,1), (‚àí1,‚àí1), (0,0), (‚àí,‚àí) or (,) in the last two dimensions, together with the Cartan generators corresponding to the first seven dimensions; * (2,56) consists of all roots with permutations of (1,0), (‚àí1,0) or (,‚àí) in the last two dimensions. The 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E8, when similarly restricted, transforms under E6√óSU(3) as: (8,1) + (1,78) + (3,27) + ( _3_ , _27_ ). We may again see the decomposition by looking at the roots together with the generators in the Cartan subalgebra. In this description, * (8,1) consists of the roots with permutations of (1,‚àí1,0) in the last three dimensions, together with the Cartan generator corresponding to the last two dimensions; * (1,78) consists of all roots with (0,0,0), (‚àí,‚àí,‚àí) or (,,) in the last three dimensions, together with the Cartan generators corresponding to the first six dimensions; * (3,27) consists of all roots with permutations of (1,0,0), (1,1,0) or (‚àí,,) in the last three dimensions. * ( _3_ , _27_ ) consists of all roots with permutations of (‚àí1,0,0), (‚àí1,‚àí1,0) or (,‚àí,‚àí) in the last three dimensions. The finite quasisimple groups that can embed in (the compact form of) E8 were found by . The Dempwolff group is a subgroup of (the compact form of) E8. It is contained in the Thompson sporadic group, which acts on the underlying vector space of the Lie group E8 but does not preserve the Lie bracket. The Thompson group fixes a lattice and does preserve the Lie bracket of this lattice mod 3, giving an embedding of the Thompson group into E8(F3).  Applications  The E8 Lie group has applications in theoretical physics and especially in string theory and supergravity. E8√óE8 is the gauge group of one of the two types of heterotic string and is one of two anomaly-free gauge groups that can be coupled to the N = 1 supergravity in ten dimensions. E8 is the U-duality group of supergravity on an eight-torus (in its split form). One way to incorporate the standard model of particle physics into heterotic string theory is the symmetry breaking of E8 to its maximal subalgebra SU(3)√óE6. In 1982, Michael Freedman used the E8 lattice to construct an example of a topological 4-manifold, the E8 manifold, which has no smooth structure. Antony Garrett Lisi's incomplete \\"An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything\\" attempts to describe all known fundamental interactions in physics as part of the E8 Lie algebra. reported an experiment where the electron spins of a cobalt-niobium crystal exhibited, under certain conditions, two of the eight peaks related to E8 that were predicted by .Most beautiful math structure appears in lab for first time, New Scientist, January 2010 (retrieved January 8, 2010).Did a 1-dimensional magnet detect a 248-dimensional Lie algebra?, Notices of the American Mathematical Society, September 2011.  History  discovered the complex Lie algebra E8 during his classification of simple compact Lie algebras, though he did not prove its existence, which was first shown by √âlie Cartan. Cartan determined that a complex simple Lie algebra of type E8 admits three real forms. Each of them gives rise to a simple Lie group of dimension 248, exactly one of which (as for any complex simple Lie algebra) is compact. introduced algebraic groups and Lie algebras of type E8 over other fields: for example, in the case of finite fields they lead to an infinite family of finite simple groups of Lie type.

History In a letter to Andrew Odlyzko, dated January 3, 1982, George P√≥lya said that while he was in G√∂ttingen around 1912 to 1914 he was asked by Edmund Landau for a physical reason that the Riemann hypothesis should be true, and suggested that this would be the case if the imaginary parts t of the zeros : \\\\tfrac12 + it of the Riemann zeta function corresponded to eigenvalues of an unbounded self- adjoint operator.. The earliest published statement of the conjecture seems to be in .. David Hilbert did not work in the central areas of analytic number theory, but his name has become known for the Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture for reasons that are anecdotal. 1950s and the Selberg trace formula At the time of P√≥lya's conversation with Landau, there was little basis for such speculation. However Selberg in the early 1950s proved a duality between the length spectrum of a Riemann surface and the eigenvalues of its Laplacian. This so-called Selberg trace formula bore a striking resemblance to the explicit formulae, which gave credibility to the Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture. 1970s and random matrices Hugh Montgomery investigated and found that the statistical distribution of the zeros on the critical line has a certain property, now called Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture. The zeros tend not to cluster too closely together, but to repel. Visiting at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1972, he showed this result to Freeman Dyson, one of the founders of the theory of random matrices. Dyson saw that the statistical distribution found by Montgomery appeared to be the same as the pair correlation distribution for the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix. These distributions are of importance in physics -- the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian, for example the energy levels of an atomic nucleus, satisfy such statistics. Subsequent work has strongly borne out the connection between the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble, and both are now believed to obey the same statistics. Thus the Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture now has a more solid basis, though it has not yet led to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.. Recent times In a development that has given substantive force to this approach to the Riemann hypothesis through functional analysis, Alain Connes has formulated a trace formula that is actually equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. This has therefore strengthened the analogy with the Selberg trace formula to the point where it gives precise statements. He gives a geometric interpretation of the explicit formula of number theory as a trace formula on noncommutative geometry of Adele classes.. Possible connection with quantum mechanics A possible connection of Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya operator with quantum mechanics was given by P√≥lya. The Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture operator is of the form \\\\tfrac{1}{2}+iH where H is the Hamiltonian of a particle of mass m that is moving under the influence of a potential V(x). The Riemann conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, or equivalently that V is real. Using perturbation theory to first order, the energy of the nth eigenstate is related to the expectation value of the potential: : E_{n}=E_{n}^{0}+ \\\\left. \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\varphi^{0}_n \\\\right  V \\\\left  \\\\varphi^{0}_n \\\\right. \\\\right \\\\rangle where E^{0}_n and \\\\varphi^{0}_n are the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the free particle Hamiltonian. This equation can be taken to be a Fredholm integral equation of first kind, with the energies E_n. Such integral equations may be solved by means of the resolvent kernel, so that the potential may be written as : V(x)=A\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left (g(k)+\\\\overline{g(k)}-E_{k}^{0} \\\\right )\\\\,R(x,k)\\\\,dk where R(x,k) is the resolvent kernel, A is a real constant and : g(k)=i \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\rho_n \\\\right)\\\\delta(k-n) where \\\\delta(k-n) is the Dirac delta function, and the \\\\rho_n are the \\"non-trivial\\" roots of the zeta function \\\\zeta (\\\\rho_n)=0 . Michael Berry and Jonathan Keating have speculated that the Hamiltonian H is actually some quantization of the classical Hamiltonian xp, where p is the canonical momentum associated with x. The simplest Hermitian operator corresponding to xp is :H = \\\\tfrac1{2} (xp+px) = - i \\\\left( x \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d} x} + \\\\frac1{2} \\\\right). This refinement of the Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture is known as the Berry conjecture (or the Berry‚ÄìKeating conjecture). As of 2008, it is still quite far from being concrete, as it is not clear on which space this operator should act in order to get the correct dynamics, nor how to regularize it in order to get the expected logarithmic corrections. Berry and Keating have conjectured that since this operator is invariant under dilations perhaps the boundary condition f(nx) = f(x) for integer n may help to get the correct asymptotic results valid for large n : \\\\frac{1}{2} + i \\\\frac{ 2\\\\pi n}{\\\\log n}. . A paper was published in March 2017, written by Carl M. Bender, Dorje C. Brody, and Markus P. M√ºller,. which builds on Berry's approach to the problem. There the operator :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{1}{1-e^{-i\\\\hat{p}}} \\\\left (\\\\hat{x}\\\\hat{p}+\\\\hat{p}\\\\hat{x} \\\\right ) \\\\left (1-e^{-i\\\\hat{p}} \\\\right ) was introduced, which they claim satisfies a certain modified versions of the conditions of the Hilbert‚ÄìP√≥lya conjecture. Jean Bellisard has criticized this paper, and the authors have responded with clarifications.. Moreover, Frederick Moxley has approached the problem with a Schr√∂dinger equation.

Like molds, dies are generally customized to the item they are used to create. Products made with dies range from simple paper clips to complex pieces used in advanced technology. Die forming Progressive die with scrap strip and stampings Forming dies were typically made by tool and die makers and put into production after mounting into a press. The die was a metal block that was used for forming materials like sheet metal and plastic. For the vacuum forming of plastic sheet only a single form was used, typically to form transparent plastic containers (called blister packs) for merchandise. Vacuum forming was considered a simple molding thermoforming process but uses the same principles as die forming. For the forming of sheet metal, such as automobile body parts, two parts may be used: one, called the punch, performed the stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation, while another part that was called the die block securely clamps the workpiece and provided similar stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation. The workpiece may pass through several stages using different tools or operations to obtain the final form. In the case of an automotive component, there was usually be a shearing operation after the main forming was done and then additional crimping or rolling operations to ensure that all sharp edges were hidden and to add rigidity to the panel. Die components The main components for die In a hole toolsets are: *Die block ‚Äì This is the main part that all the other parts are attached to. *Punch plate ‚Äì This part holds and supports the different punches in place. *Blank punch ‚Äì This part along with the blank die produces the blanked part. *Pierce punch ‚Äì This part along with the pierce die removes parts from the blanked finished part. *Stripper plate ‚Äì This is used to hold the material down on the blank/pierce die and strip the material off the punches. *Pilot ‚Äì This will help to place the sheet accurately for the next stage of operation. *Guide, back gauge, or finger stop ‚Äì These parts are all used to make sure that the material being worked on always goes in the same position, within the die, as the last one. *Setting (stop) block ‚Äì This part is used to control the depth that the punch goes into the die. *Blanking dies in a hole ‚Äì See blanking punch *Pierce die in a hole‚Äì See pierce punch. *Shank ‚Äì used to hold in the presses. it should be aligned and situated at the center of gravity of the plate. Process *Blanking: A blanking die produces a flat piece of material by cutting the desired shape in one operation. The finished part is referred to as a blank. Generally a blanking die may only cut the outside contour of a part, often used for parts with no internal features. Three benefits to die blanking are: #Accuracy. A properly sharpened die, with the correct amount of clearance between the punch and die, will produce a part that holds close dimensional tolerances in relationship to the part's edges. #Appearance. Since the part is blanked in one operation, the finish edges of the part produces a uniform appearance as opposed to varying degrees of burnishing from multiple operations. #Flatness. Due to the even compression of the blanking process, the end result is a flat part that may retain a specific level of flatness for additional manufacturing operations. *Broaching: The process of removing material through the use of multiple cutting teeth, with each tooth cutting behind the other. A broaching die is often used to remove material from parts that are too thick for shaving. *Bulging: A bulging die expands the closed end of tube through the use of two types of bulging dies. Similar to the way a chef's hat bulges out at the top from the cylindrical band around the chef's head. #Bulging fluid dies: Uses water or oil as a vehicle to expand the part. #Bulging rubber dies: Uses a rubber pad or block under pressure to move the wall of a workpiece. *Coining: is similar to forming with the main difference being that a coining die may form completely different features on either face of the blank, these features being transferred from the face of the punch or die respectively. The coining die and punch flow the metal by squeezing the blank within a confined area, instead of bending the blank. For example, an Olympic medal that was formed from a coining die may have a flat surface on the back and a raised feature on the front. If the medal was formed (or embossed), the surface on the back would be the reverse image of the front. *Compound operations: Compound dies perform multiple operations on the part. The compound operation is the act of implementing more than one operation during the press cycle. *Compound die: A type of die that has the die block (matrix) mounted on a punch plate with perforators in the upper die with the inner punch mounted in the lower die set. An inverted type of blanking dies that punches upwards, leaving the part sitting on the lower punch (after being shed from the upper matrix on the press return stroke) instead of blanking the part through. A compound die allows the cutting of internal and external part features on a single press stroke. *Curling: The curling operation is used to roll the material into a curved shape. A door hinge is an example of a part created by a curling die. *Cut off: Cut off dies are used to cut off excess material from a finished end of a part or to cut off a predetermined length of material strip for additional operations. *Drawing: The drawing operation is very similar to the forming operation except that the drawing operation undergoes severe plastic deformation and the material of the part extends around the sides. A metal cup with a detailed feature at the bottom is an example of the difference between formed and drawn. The bottom of the cup was formed while the sides were drawn. *Extruding: Extruding is the act of severely deforming blanks of metal called slugs into finished parts such as an aluminum I-beam. Extrusion dies use extremely high pressure from the punch to squeeze the metal out into the desired form. The difference between cold forming and extrusion is extruded parts do not take shape of the punch. *Forming: Forming dies to bend the blank along a curved surface. An example of a part that has been formed would be the positive end(+) of a AA battery. *Cold forming (cold heading): Cold forming is similar to extruding in that it squeezes the blank material but cold forming uses the punch and the die to create the desired form, extruding does not. Roll Forming Stand *Roll forming: a continuous bending operation in which sheet or strip metal is gradually formed in tandem sets of rollers until the desired cross-sectional configuration is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing parts with long lengths or in large quantities. *Horning: A horning die provides an arbor or horn in which the parts are placed for secondary operations. *Hydroforming: Forming of tubular part from simpler tubes with high water pressure. *Pancake die: A Pancake die is a simple type of manufacturing die that performs blanking and/or piercing. While many dies perform complex procedures simultaneously, a pancake die may only perform one simple procedure with the finished product being removed by hand. *Piercing: The piercing operation is used to pierce holes in stampings. *Transfer die: Transfer dies provide different stations for operations to be performed. A common practice is to move the material through the die so it is progressively modified at each station until the final operation ejects a finished part. *Progressive die: The sheet metal is fed through as a coil strip, and a different operation (such as punching, blanking, and notching) is performed at the same station of the machine with each stroke of a series of punches. *Shaving: The shaving operation removes a small amount of material from the edges of the part to improve the edges finish or part accuracy. (Compare to Trimming). *Side cam die: Side cams transform vertical motion from the press ram into horizontal or angular motion. *Sub press operation: Sub-press dies blank and/or form small watch, clock, and instrument parts. *Swaging: Swaging (necking) is the process of \\"necking down\\" a feature on a part. Swaging is the opposite of bulging as it reduces the size of the part. The end of a shell casing that captures the bullet is an example of swaging. *Trimming: Trimming dies cut away excess or unwanted irregular features from a part, they are usually the last operation performed. *Pillar set: Pillar set are used for alignment of dies in press movement. = Steel-rule die, also known as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer materials, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of hardened steel strips, known as steel rule. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, they are not as robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.. File:Steel-rule die 2.pngA steel-rule die File:Steel-rule die.pngA steel-rule die File:Steel-rule die in press.pngSteel-rule die in a press = In the broadest sense, a rotary die is a cylindrical shaped die that may be used in any manufacturing field. However, it most commonly refers to cylindrical shaped dies used to process soft materials, such as paper or cardboard. Two rules are used, cutting and creasing rules. This is for corrugated boards whose thickness is more than 2 mm. Rotary dies are faster than flat dies. The term also refers to dies used in the roll forming process. Wire pulling Wire-making dies have a hole through the middle of them. A wire or rod of steel, copper, other metals, or alloy enters into one side and is lubricated and reduced in size. The leading tip of the wire is usually pointed in the process. The tip of the wire is then guided into the die and rolled onto a block on the opposite side. The block provides the power to pull the wire through the die. The die is divided into several different sections. First is an entrance angle that guides the wire into the die. Next is the approach angle, which brings the wire to the nib, which facilitates the reduction. Next is the bearing and the back relief. Lubrication is added at the entrance angle. The lube can be in powdered soap form. If the lubricant is soap, the friction of the drawing of wire heats the soap to liquid form and coats the wire. The wire should never actually come in contact with the die. A thin coat of lubricant should prevent the metal to metal contact. For pulling a substantial rod down to a fine wire a series of several dies is used to obtain progressive reduction of diameter in stages. Standard wire gauges used to refer to the number of dies through which the wire had been pulled. Thus, a higher-numbered wire gauge meant a thinner wire. Typical telephone wires were 22-gauge, while main power cables might be 3- or 4-gauge. References Bibliography * Further reading *J. R. Paquin and R. E. Crowley (1987). Die Design Fundamentals.

Asymptotic freedom is a feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of nuclear matter. Quarks interact weakly at high energies, allowing perturbative calculations. At low energies the interaction becomes strong, leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within composite hadrons. The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek, and independently by David Politzer in the same year. For this work all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Discovery  Asymptotic freedom in QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek, and independently by David Politzer in the same year. The same phenomenon had previously been observed (in quantum electrodynamics with a charged vector field, by V.S. Vanyashin and M.V. Terent'ev in 1965; and Yang‚ÄìMills theory by Iosif Khriplovich in 1969 and Gerard 't Hooft in 1972 Gerard 't Hooft, \\"When was Asymptotic Freedom discovered? or The Rehabilitation of Quantum Field Theory\\", Nucl. Phys. Proc. Suppl. 74:413‚Äì425, 1999, arXiv:hep-th/9808154), but its physical significance was not realized until the work of Gross, Wilczek and Politzer, which was recognized by the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics. The discovery was instrumental in \\"rehabilitating\\" quantum field theory. Prior to 1973, many theorists suspected that field theory was fundamentally inconsistent because the interactions become infinitely strong at short distances. This phenomenon is usually called a Landau pole, and it defines the smallest length scale that a theory can describe. This problem was discovered in field theories of interacting scalars and spinors, including quantum electrodynamics (QED), and Lehman positivity led many to suspect that it is unavoidable. Asymptotically free theories become weak at short distances, there is no Landau pole, and these quantum field theories are believed to be completely consistent down to any length scale. The Standard Model is not asymptotically free, with the Landau pole a problem when considering the Higgs boson. Quantum triviality can be used to bound or predict parameters such as the Higgs boson mass. This leads to a predictable Higgs mass in asymptotic safety scenarios. In other scenarios, interactions are weak so that any inconsistency arises at distances shorter than the Planck length.  Screening and antiscreening  Charge screening in QED The variation in a physical coupling constant under changes of scale can be understood qualitatively as coming from the action of the field on virtual particles carrying the relevant charge. The Landau pole behavior of QED (related to quantum triviality) is a consequence of screening by virtual charged particle‚Äìantiparticle pairs, such as electron‚Äìpositron pairs, in the vacuum. In the vicinity of a charge, the vacuum becomes polarized: virtual particles of opposing charge are attracted to the charge, and virtual particles of like charge are repelled. The net effect is to partially cancel out the field at any finite distance. Getting closer and closer to the central charge, one sees less and less of the effect of the vacuum, and the effective charge increases. In QCD the same thing happens with virtual quark-antiquark pairs; they tend to screen the color charge. However, QCD has an additional wrinkle: its force-carrying particles, the gluons, themselves carry color charge, and in a different manner. Each gluon carries both a color charge and an anti-color magnetic moment. The net effect of polarization of virtual gluons in the vacuum is not to screen the field but to augment it and change its color. This is sometimes called antiscreening. Getting closer to a quark diminishes the antiscreening effect of the surrounding virtual gluons, so the contribution of this effect would be to weaken the effective charge with decreasing distance. Since the virtual quarks and the virtual gluons contribute opposite effects, which effect wins out depends on the number of different kinds, or flavors, of quark. For standard QCD with three colors, as long as there are no more than 16 flavors of quark (not counting the antiquarks separately), antiscreening prevails and the theory is asymptotically free. In fact, there are only 6 known quark flavors.  Calculating asymptotic freedom  Asymptotic freedom can be derived by calculating the beta-function describing the variation of the theory's coupling constant under the renormalization group. For sufficiently short distances or large exchanges of momentum (which probe short-distance behavior, roughly because of the inverse relationship between a quantum's momentum and De Broglie wavelength), an asymptotically free theory is amenable to perturbation theory calculations using Feynman diagrams. Such situations are therefore more theoretically tractable than the long-distance, strong-coupling behavior also often present in such theories, which is thought to produce confinement. Calculating the beta-function is a matter of evaluating Feynman diagrams contributing to the interaction of a quark emitting or absorbing a gluon. Essentially, the beta-function describes how the coupling constants vary as one scales the system x \\\\rightarrow bx. The calculation can be done using rescaling in position space or momentum space (momentum shell integration). In non-abelian gauge theories such as QCD, the existence of asymptotic freedom depends on the gauge group and number of flavors of interacting particles. To lowest nontrivial order, the beta-function in an SU(N) gauge theory with n_f kinds of quark-like particle is :\\\\beta_1(\\\\alpha) = { \\\\alpha^2 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\left( -{11N \\\\over 6} + {n_f \\\\over 3} \\\\right) where \\\\alpha is the theory's equivalent of the fine-structure constant, g^2/(4 \\\\pi) in the units favored by particle physicists. If this function is negative, the theory is asymptotically free. For SU(3), one has N = 3, and the requirement that \\\\beta_1 < 0 gives :n_f < {33 \\\\over 2}. Thus for SU(3), the color charge gauge group of QCD, the theory is asymptotically free if there are 16 or fewer flavors of quarks. Besides QCD, asymptotic freedom can also be seen in other systems like the nonlinear \\\\sigma-model in 2 dimensions, which has a structure similar to the SU(N) invariant Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions. Finally, one can find theories that are asymptotically free and reduce to the full Standard Model of electromagnetic, weak and strong forces at low enough energies.

Early years Harold Floyd Brooks was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and was the brother of David \\"Bubba\\" Brooks. The nickname \\"Tina\\", pronounced Teena, was a variation of \\"Teeny\\", a childhood moniker. His favourite tune was \\"My Devotion\\".Original 1980 liner notes to Minor Move by Lawrence Kart He studied harmony and theory with Herbert Bourne. Initially, he studied the C-melody saxophone, which he began playing shortly after he moved to New York with his family in 1944. Brooks' first professional work came in 1951 with rhythm and blues pianist Sonny Thompson, and in 1955 Brooks played with vibraphonist Lionel Hampton. Brooks also received less formal guidance from trumpeter and composer \\"Little\\" Benny Harris, who led the saxophonist to his first recording as a leader. Harris, in fact, was the one who recommended him to Blue Note producer Alfred Lion in 1958. Recordings Brooks is best known for his work for the Blue Note label between 1958 and 1961, recording as a sideman with Kenny Burrell, Freddie Hubbard, Jackie McLean, Freddie Redd, and Jimmy Smith. Around the same period, Brooks was McLean's understudy in The Connection, a play by Jack Gelber with music by Redd, and performed on an album of music from the play on Felsted Records, a session which also featured Howard McGhee. Brooks recorded five sessions of his own for Blue Note (including one jointly with McLean). The first session was recorded on March 16, 1958 at the Van Gelder Studio in Hackensack, New Jersey, and featured trumpeter Lee Morgan alongside seasoned professionals such as Sonny Clark, Doug Watkins and Art Blakey. Despite the calibre of the players and the quality of the output, Minor Move was not released for more than two decades, several years after Brooks had died. This started an unfortunate trend, as the other three of his four other sessions (Street Singer, Back to the Tracks and The Waiting Game) did not appear during his lifetime. The exception was True Blue, a session recorded on June 25, 1960 with Freddie Hubbard, Duke Jordan, Sam Jones and Art Taylor. The release of True Blue coincided with the release of Hubbard's Blue Note debut album, Open Sesame (also featuring Brooks, who wrote the opening title track as well as \\"Gypsy Blue\\"), and was not actively promoted.Jack Chambers \\"Who Killed Tina Brooks?\\", Coda, 321, May/June 2005, p.12-16, 37 Brooks did not record after 1961. Plagued by heroin dependency, and gradually deteriorating health, he died of liver failure aged 42. Legacy Michael Cuscuna in 1985, through Mosaic Records, released a boxset of Brooks' recordings as leader; the limited edition is out of print. The interest in Brooks' music has also led to releases of the unissued sessions through Blue Note Japan and on CD in Blue Note's Connoisseur series. In the liner notes for the CD release of Back to the Tracks, Cuscuna wrote: \\"Far lesser talents have been far more celebrated\\" and that Brooks \\"was a unique, sensitive improviser who could weave beautiful and complex tapestries through his horn. His lyricism, unity of ideas and inner logic were astounding.\\"Michael Cuscuna (1998) Liner note for Tina Brooks Back to the Tracks, Blue Note CD 21737. David Rosenthal in his book Hard Bop: Jazz and Black Music 1955-1965 wrote about Brooks. Of his composition \\"Street Singer\\", Rosenthal wrote that it is \\"an authentic hard-bop classic\\" where \\"pathos, irony and rage come together in a performance at once anguished and sinister.\\"David H. Rosenthal (1992), Hard Bop: Jazz and Black Music 1955-1965, New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 127, 126. The official Blue Note website says of Brooks, \\"With a strong, smooth tone and an amazing flow of fresh ideas every time he soloed, tenor saxophonist Tina Brooks should have been a major jazz artist, but his legacy is confined to a series of dates that he did for Blue Note as a sideman and leader\\" and that he \\"was one of the most brilliant, if underrated, tenor saxophonists in modern jazz.\\" Discography All on Blue Note Records, unless otherwise indicated.

He was the father of Greek music and through it, of lyric poetry, although his own poetical compositions were few and in extremely simple rhythms. He simplified rules of the modes of singing of other neighboring countries and islands and formed, out of these syncopated variants, a conceptual system.From which the Greek music theory continued thereafter in all the improvements and refinements of later ages Though endowed with an inventive mind, and the commencer of a new era of music, he attempted no more than to systematize the musical styles that existed in the music of Greece and Anatolia. Biography About the time of the Second Messenian War, he settled in Sparta, to where, according to some accounts, he had been summoned by command of the Delphic Oracle, to compose the differences that had arisen between different classes in the state. Here he gained the prize in the musical contests at the festival of Carnea.676‚Äì2 BC; Athenaeus, 635 e. He is regarded as the real founder of Greek classical music and lyric poetry, but as to his innovations in music, our information is imperfect. According to Strabo,xiii. p. 618 he increased the number of strings in the lyre from four to seven; others take the fragment of Terpander on which Strabo bases his statement to mean that he developed the citharoedic nomos (sung to the accompaniment of the cithara or lyre) by making the divisions of the ode seven instead of four. The seven-stringed lyre was probably already in existence. Terpander is also said to have introduced several new rhythms in addition to the dactylic and to have been famous as a composer of drinking-songs (skolia). No poems attributed to Terpander survive complete, and very few lines of his are quoted by later Greek writers; it must be regarded as doubtful whether he worked in writing.

The name means The Shameful Kiss, or The Kiss of Shame since it involved kissing the devil's anus, his other mouth. According to folklore, it was this kiss that allowed the Devil to seduce women. The Kiss of Shame During the years of the witch hunts, many believed that witches worshipped the Devil and paid him homage by kissing his posterior. The osculum infame is mentioned in nearly every single recorded account of a witches' sabbat and in confessions ‚Äì most of which were extracted under torture. Although most common in Europe, no illustrations of it exist in the publications of English persecutions, possibly as torture was not regularly employed in the questioning of those accused. It was called the kiss of shame because it was generally regarded as an act of degradation. According to the allegations, witches would give the kiss of shame at the beginning of the sabbat, after the Devil had read the names of his followers. They would approach him by crawling or walking backwards, turn, bow and kiss his posterior. It was believed that this kiss was required for a new witch to be initiated, and the kiss was followed by feasting. Sometimes witches kissed not only the Devil's fundament, but lower-ranking demons' as well. Generally considered to be an act of homage, or respect, the North Berwick Witch Trials of Scotland in the 16th century held that the kiss was an act of penance issued from the Devil. Reported in Newes from Scotland, declaring the damnable Life of Doctor Fian (1592) by W. Wright:...and seeing that they tarried over long, hee at their coming enjoyned them all to a pennance, which was, that they should kisse his buttockes, in sign of duety to him, which being put over the pulpit bare, every one did as he had enjoyned them. The pamphlet provided the first descriptions of the osculum infame to the English population. Belief held that the Devil demanded the kiss of shame in forms other than human, including rams, black cats, and toads. Errores Haereticorum, a medieval tract, claims that the Cathars took their name \\"from the term cat, whose posterior they kiss, in whose form Satan appears to them.\\" The role could also be reversed whereby the witch was the recipient of the kiss.

In mathematics, the ADE classification (originally A-D-E classifications) is a situation where certain kinds of objects are in correspondence with simply laced Dynkin diagrams. The question of giving a common origin to these classifications, rather than a posteriori verification of a parallelism, was posed in . The complete list of simply laced Dynkin diagrams comprises :A_n, \\\\, D_n, \\\\, E_6, \\\\, E_7, \\\\, E_8. Here \\"simply laced\\" means that there are no multiple edges, which corresponds to all simple roots in the root system forming angles of \\\\pi/2 = 90^\\\\circ (no edge between the vertices) or 2\\\\pi/3 = 120^\\\\circ (single edge between the vertices). These are two of the four families of Dynkin diagrams (omitting B_n and C_n), and three of the five exceptional Dynkin diagrams (omitting F_4 and G_2). This list is non-redundant if one takes n \\\\geq 4 for D_n. If one extends the families to include redundant terms, one obtains the exceptional isomorphisms :D_3 \\\\cong A_3, E_4 \\\\cong A_4, E_5 \\\\cong D_5, and corresponding isomorphisms of classified objects. The A, D, E nomenclature also yields the simply laced finite Coxeter groups, by the same diagrams: in this case the Dynkin diagrams exactly coincide with the Coxeter diagrams, as there are no multiple edges.  Lie algebras  In terms of complex semisimple Lie algebras: * A_n corresponds to \\\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\\\\mathbf{C}), the special linear Lie algebra of traceless operators, * D_n corresponds to \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\\\mathbf{C}), the even special orthogonal Lie algebra of even-dimensional skew-symmetric operators, and * E_6, E_7, E_8 are three of the five exceptional Lie algebras. In terms of compact Lie algebras and corresponding simply laced Lie groups: * A_n corresponds to \\\\mathfrak{su}_{n+1}, the algebra of the special unitary group SU(n+1); * D_n corresponds to \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\\\mathbf{R}), the algebra of the even projective special orthogonal group PSO(2n), while * E_6, E_7, E_8 are three of five exceptional compact Lie algebras.  Binary polyhedral groups  The same classification applies to discrete subgroups of SU(2), the binary polyhedral groups; properly, binary polyhedral groups correspond to the simply laced affine Dynkin diagrams \\\\tilde A_n, \\\\tilde D_n, \\\\tilde E_k, and the representations of these groups can be understood in terms of these diagrams. This connection is known as the ' after John McKay. The connection to Platonic solids is described in . The correspondence uses the construction of McKay graph. Note that the ADE correspondence is not the correspondence of Platonic solids to their reflection group of symmetries: for instance, in the ADE correspondence the tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, and dodecahedron/icosahedron correspond to E_6, E_7, E_8, while the reflection groups of the tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, and dodecahedron/icosahedron are instead representations of the Coxeter groups A_3, BC_3, and H_3. The orbifold of \\\\mathbf{C}^2 constructed using each discrete subgroup leads to an ADE-type singularity at the origin, termed a du Val singularity. The McKay correspondence can be extended to multiply laced Dynkin diagrams, by using a pair of binary polyhedral groups. This is known as the Slodowy correspondence, named after Peter Slodowy ‚Äì see .  Labeled graphs  The ADE graphs and the extended (affine) ADE graphs can also be characterized in terms of labellings with certain properties, which can be stated in terms of the discrete Laplace operators or Cartan matrices. Proofs in terms of Cartan matrices may be found in . The affine ADE graphs are the only graphs that admit a positive labeling (labeling of the nodes by positive real numbers) with the following property: :Twice any label is the sum of the labels on adjacent vertices. That is, they are the only positive functions with eigenvalue 1 for the discrete Laplacian (sum of adjacent vertices minus value of vertex) ‚Äì the positive solutions to the homogeneous equation: :\\\\Delta \\\\phi = \\\\phi.\\\\ Equivalently, the positive functions in the kernel of \\\\Delta - I. The resulting numbering is unique up to scale, and if normalized such that the smallest number is 1, consists of small integers ‚Äì 1 through 6, depending on the graph. The ordinary ADE graphs are the only graphs that admit a positive labeling with the following property: :Twice any label minus two is the sum of the labels on adjacent vertices. In terms of the Laplacian, the positive solutions to the inhomogeneous equation: :\\\\Delta \\\\phi = \\\\phi - 2.\\\\ The resulting numbering is unique (scale is specified by the \\"2\\") and consists of integers; for E8 they range from 58 to 270, and have been observed as early as .  Other classifications  The elementary catastrophes are also classified by the ADE classification. The ADE diagrams are exactly the quivers of finite type, via Gabriel's theorem. There is also a link with generalized quadrangles, as the three non-degenerate GQs with three points on each line correspond to the three exceptional root systems E6, E7 and E8.Cameron P.J.; Goethals, J.M.; Seidel, J.J; Shult, E. E. Line graphs, root systems and elliptic geometry The classes A and D correspond degenerate cases where the line set is empty or we have all lines passing through a fixed point, respectively.Godsil Chris; Gordon Royle. Algebraic Graph Theory, Chapter 12 There are deep connections between these objects, hinted at by the classification; some of these connections can be understood via string theory and quantum mechanics. It was suggested that symmetries of small droplet clusters may be subject to an ADE classification.Fedorets A. A., et al. Symmetry of small clusters of levitating water droplets. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1039/D0CP01804J The minimal models of two-dimensional conformal field theory have an ADE classification. Four dimensional \\\\mathcal{N}=2 superconformal gauge quiver theories with unitary gauge groups have an ADE classification.  Trinities  Arnold has subsequently proposed many further connections in this vein, under the rubric of \\"mathematical trinities\\",Arnold, Vladimir, 1997, Toronto Lectures, Lecture 2: Symplectization, Complexification and Mathematical Trinities, June 1997 (last updated August, 1998).

Further trinities have been suggested by other authors.Les trinit√©s remarquables, Fr√©d√©ric Chapoton Arnold's trinities begin with R/C/H (the real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions), which he remarks \\"everyone knows\\", and proceeds to imagine the other trinities as \\"complexifications\\" and \\"quaternionifications\\" of classical (real) mathematics, by analogy with finding symplectic analogs of classic Riemannian geometry, which he had previously proposed in the 1970s. In addition to examples from differential topology (such as characteristic classes), Arnold considers the three Platonic symmetries (tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral) as corresponding to the reals, complexes, and quaternions, which then connects with McKay's more algebraic correspondences, below. McKay's correspondences are easier to describe. Firstly, the extended Dynkin diagrams \\\\tilde E_6, \\\\tilde E_7, \\\\tilde E_8 (corresponding to tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetry) have symmetry groups S_3, S_2, S_1, respectively, and the associated foldings are the diagrams \\\\tilde G_2, \\\\tilde F_4, \\\\tilde E_8 (note that in less careful writing, the extended (tilde) qualifier is often omitted). More significantly, McKay suggests a correspondence between the nodes of the \\\\tilde E_8 diagram and certain conjugacy classes of the monster group, which is known as McKay's E8 observation;Arithmetic groups and the affine E8 Dynkin diagram, by John F. Duncan, in Groups and symmetries: from Neolithic Scots to John McKay see also monstrous moonshine. McKay further relates the nodes of \\\\tilde E_7 to conjugacy classes in 2.B (an order 2 extension of the baby monster group), and the nodes of \\\\tilde E_6 to conjugacy classes in 3.Fi24' (an order 3 extension of the Fischer group) ‚Äì note that these are the three largest sporadic groups, and that the order of the extension corresponds to the symmetries of the diagram. Turning from large simple groups to small ones, the corresponding Platonic groups A_4, S_4, A_5 have connections with the projective special linear groups PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7), and PSL(2,11) (orders 60, 168, and 660), which is deemed a \\"McKay correspondence\\". These groups are the only (simple) values for p such that PSL(2,p) acts non-trivially on p points, a fact dating back to √âvariste Galois in the 1830s. In fact, the groups decompose as products of sets (not as products of groups) as: A_4 \\\\times Z_5, S_4 \\\\times Z_7, and A_5 \\\\times Z_{11}. These groups also are related to various geometries, which dates to Felix Klein in the 1870s; see icosahedral symmetry: related geometries for historical discussion and for more recent exposition. Associated geometries (tilings on Riemann surfaces) in which the action on p points can be seen are as follows: PSL(2,5) is the symmetries of the icosahedron (genus 0) with the compound of five tetrahedra as a 5-element set, PSL(2,7) of the Klein quartic (genus 3) with an embedded (complementary) Fano plane as a 7-element set (order 2 biplane), and PSL(2,11) the ' (genus 70) with embedded Paley biplane as an 11-element set (order 3 biplane). Of these, the icosahedron dates to antiquity, the Klein quartic to Klein in the 1870s, and the buckyball surface to Pablo Martin and David Singerman in 2008. Algebro-geometrically, McKay also associates E6, E7, E8 respectively with: the 27 lines on a cubic surface, the 28 bitangents of a plane quartic curve, and the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4.Arnold 1997, p. 13 The first of these is well- known, while the second is connected as follows: projecting the cubic from any point not on a line yields a double cover of the plane, branched along a quartic curve, with the 27 lines mapping to 27 of the 28 bitangents, and the 28th line is the image of the exceptional curve of the blowup. Note that the fundamental representations of E6, E7, E8 have dimensions 27, 56 (28¬∑2), and 248 (120+128), while the number of roots is 27+45 = 72, 56+70 = 126, and 112+128 = 240. This should also fit into the scheme Yang-Hui He and John McKay, https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06742 of relating E8,7,6 with the largest three of the Sporadic simple groups, Monster, Baby and Fischer 24', cf.

Among other things, it contains the Port of Rotterdam (the busiest seaport in Europe and until 2004 also the world's busiest seaport), the Port of Amsterdam (Europe's fifth busiest seaport), and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (third-busiest European airport). With a population of 8.2 million peoplehttps://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/03759ned/table?dl=DA8F it is one of the largest metropolitan regions in Europe, comparable in population size to the Milan metropolitan area or the San Francisco Bay Area, and covers an area of approximately . With a population density of it also is one of the most important and densely populated economic areas in northwestern Europe. It encompasses both the Amsterdam metropolitan area and Rotterdam‚ÄìThe Hague metropolitan area. The Randstad's main cities are Almere, Amersfoort, Amsterdam, Delft, Dordrecht, Haarlem, Leiden, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Zaanstad and Zoetermeer. Other cities include Alkmaar, Alphen aan den Rijn, Amstelveen, Hilversum and the smaller towns of Barendrecht, Breukelen, Capelle aan den IJssel, Gouda, Hoek van Holland, Hoofddorp, Hoorn, Houten, Katwijk, Leidschendam, Maarssen, Maassluis, Naaldwijk, Nieuwegein, Oostzaan, Papendrecht, Purmerend, Rijswijk, Schiedam, Spijkenisse, Vlaardingen, Voorburg, Voorschoten, Woerden and Zeist. Although the name Randstad is often translated into English as \\"edge city\\" or \\"border city\\", a more accurate translation would be \\"rim city\\". The Dutch name was coined in 1938 by KLM founder Albert Plesman who, while flying over the region, used it to describe a strip of cities at the rim of a large green agricultural area (the Green Heart).The Randstad conurbation: a floating metropolis in the Dutch Delta (PDF), Pim Kooij, Paul van de Laar; Rijksuniversiteit Groningen Journal Hosting While technically more of a crescent (the southeastern edge of the rim is significantly less populated), the ring shape formed by connecting the four major cities of the region led to the use of the name \\"Ring City\\".Randstad (Region, Netherlands), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Geography Image:Randstad_with_scale.pngthumbleftSchematic map of the Randstad circle 528 380 26 Schiphol rect 426 356 498 436 Haarlemmermeer rect 399 166 479 245 Velsen circle 250 716 32 Delft circle 220 642 60 The Hague circle 456 569 27 Alphen aan den Rijn circle 555 201 52 Zaanstad circle 999 168 42 Lelystad circle 798 474 29 Hilversum circle 492 692 34 Gouda circle 347 654 31 Zoetermeer circle 944 532 40 Amersfoort circle 521 24 33 Alkmaar circle 442 294 44 Haarlem circle 466 943 36 Dordrecht circle 334 537 30 Leiden circle 840 314 50 Almere rect 245 738 400 869 Rotterdam rect 13 725 81 789 Port of Rotterdam rect 82 749 116 788 Port of Rotterdam rect 117 778 148 803 Port of Rotterdam rect 120 804 209 835 Port of Rotterdam rect 158 826 247 857 Port of Rotterdam circle 742 617 53 Utrecht circle 615 324 88 Amsterdam Bubble map showing the population sizes of larger towns and cities in the Randstad circa 2012 Recently, Dutch planners have started to refer to the Randstad as Deltametropool. This actually consists of two large metropolitan areas: Noordvleugel The Noordvleugel (\\"North Wing\\"), with a population of around 3.6 million people, consists of the Haarlem and IJmuiden conurbations in the west, Amsterdam at the centre and Almere, the Gooi area and Utrecht in the east. The conurbation of Utrecht (population around 1 million) can be considered to be part of this wing, but can also be excluded. The cultural centre of the Noordvleugel, however, is notably centered on Amsterdam, which could as such be considered a classical centralistic metropolis. Amsterdam recently started to present itself as the Amsterdam metropolitan area (Metropoolregio Amsterdam). The expectation is that the use of the Noordvleugel and the Randstad will become less as a result. While Utrecht is not the center of the Noordvleugel, it is in fact the center of the whole of the Netherlands itself. While being categorised as part of the Randstad, the Utrecht agglomeration lies relatively further apart, owing to its long history of rivalry with Holland and Amsterdam in particular. Utrecht is much more monocentric than Amsterdam, which has booming satellite cities such as Haarlem and Almere. While Utrecht functions as the gateway to the Randstad for both car and rail transport, it is disconnected from the virtually continuous urbanised zone in western Holland by the protected polder landscape of the Groene Hart. The North Wing of the Randstad is expected to grow more in population than the Zuidvleugel and the Groene Hart areas, with the growth of population also being in effect for a longer period of time, compared to the other two areas.  Randstad 2040, page 28 (in Dutch). Zuidvleugel The Zuidvleugel (\\"South Wing\\"), with a population of around 3.5 million people, stretches some 60 kilometers from Dordrecht in the southeast to Leiden in the north. The main conurbations are the Rotterdam and The Hague areas. The virtual centre of the Zuidvleugel lies in between these two major cities, near Delft. The first steps toward this development were taken with the construction of a new fast light-rail connection between Rotterdam and The Hague: RandstadRail. A long-delayed extension of the western A4 motorway from the south of Delft to Rotterdam has also been constructed, creating a second connection from Rotterdam, via The Hague, to Amsterdam. A possible new area would be the Zuidoostflank; parallel to the A2 motorway (from Amsterdam to Eindhoven) and parallel to the A12 motorway (Utrecht to WERV (Wageningen, Ede, Rhenen and Veenendaal)), as this region has much potential to strengthen the knowledge economy of the Randstad. Over the last few decades, a major topic in the Randstad is the conflict between the cities and the towns in between. These towns and the surrounding countryside, known as the Groene Hart (Green Heart), are usually much greener than the cities, they house many commuters that work in the cities and the former strongly depend on the latter for facilities such as hospitals and large scale entertainment. Cities need more space to expand, yet the towns fear losing their identity and autonomy.  Boundary issues  Amsterdam Zuidas The Hague Rotterdam Utrecht The Randstad's borders have never been officially specified. Some consider only the four most populous cities of the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) part of it, others would say that areas such as Alkmaar (which represents itself as being part of it),Deutsch-Alkmaar ‚Äì Gemeente Alkmaar . Alkmaar.nl (2012-11-14). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.http://www.kennemerwonen.nl/uploads/U%20zoekt%20een%20woning/Wijkinformatie/Alkmaar%20Oudorp.pdfAlkmaar ‚Äì Who or What is Alkmaar? Find out more . Encycl.opentopia.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-16. Hoorn and Lelystad are also part of this conurbation. The publication \\"Randstad 2040\\", released by the Government of the Netherlands, reveals that the Noordvleugel (Amsterdam and Utrecht region) is already growing parallel to the A1, A2, and A4 motorways, as well as into the northern part of North Holland (Alkmaar and Hoorn region) and Flevoland (Almere and Lelystad region).  Randstad 2040, page 9 (in Dutch) There is also a trend shown that the Noordvleugel is expanding parallel to the A2 (Amsterdam towards Eindhoven) and A12 (Utrecht towards the WERV region, encompassing the cities of Wageningen, Ede, Rhenen and Veenendaal) motorways. This region is called the Zuidoostflank (English: Southeastside).  Randstad 2040, page 25 (in Dutch).  Culture  It is sometimes argued that a cultural divide exists between the Randstad and the rest of the country. This distinction is usually made in relation to Dutch politics and media, who according to critics are mostly interested in the affairs of the Randstad. Both branches (government and media) have their center in the Randstad; respectively in The Hague and in Hilversum. The Randstad itself, however, does not represent a unified cultural zone. It is not a 'place' of residence or a carrier of cultural identity. According to the late influential urbanist Niek de Boer, the Randstad simply 'does not exist'.Niek De Boer - De Randstad bestaat niet (1996) Nai Publishers While the cities and landscapes in the Randstad share some commonalities, there are also large differences originating in centuries of divergent development. There are strong local identities within the region, especially in rural environments. In the broadest terms the Randstad is culturally divided between the more politically progressive northern urban centers of Amsterdam, Haarlem and Utrecht, and the more conservative southern urban centers of The Hague, Rotterdam and Dordrecht. However, the university cities of Leiden and Delft, while geographically located in the southern part of the Randstad, also have a more progressive outlook probably as a result of hosting two of the largest universities in the country.  Transportation  A RandstadRail LRV between Zoetermeer and The Hague The Randstad possesses a large infrastructure system, with many railways, motorways, trams and subways in various cities. It is possible to cycle on reasonably safe and pleasant routes almost everywhere and cycling is a major mode of transport. The Port of Rotterdam, and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, are both major international gateways. There are various smaller ports and airports in the Randstad, like the ports of IJmuiden, Amsterdam and Dordrecht, as well as Rotterdam The Hague Airport.  Motorways  The Randstad has various motorways, most of them starting around Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Many (inter)national corridors start in the Randstad, including the A1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A12, A13, A15, A16, A20, A27 and A28 autosnelwegen, as well as various commuter routes. The Randstad network of motorways carry some of the highest traffic volumes in Europe. Until 2005 most motorways used to be no wider than four or six lanes, but from 2005 on capacity of most major highways expanded to six or eight and on some parts even ten lanes. A 14-lane highway is projected near Utrecht. Some hard shoulders are in use as peak hour lanes ‚Äì traffic is allowed to use the hard shoulder as a third or fourth lane during periods of congestion, when traffic management signs indicate. Since these expansions traffic jams (which used to be quite intense) have been reduced by up to 25%. Traffic on the highway still is quite heavy, though. Because of the many obstructions in minor roads, such as one-way or circular routes (often created to make living neighbourhoods safer), a lot of local traffic also uses the motorways. Another growing issue is the number of trucks on the radiating motorways from the Randstad; truck volumes can be as high as 20,000 trucks per day, occupying the entire right lane on some motorways.  Railways  The Randstad is the keystone of the Dutch railway network; most intercity connections terminate in one of the key cities in the Randstad. The railway network in the area is dense and heavily used. Together with the Swiss Federal Railways (1st), and the Belgian railways (3rd), the Dutch Railways are in the top 3 of Europe in punctuality.  Treinreiziger (in Dutch)http://www.treinreiziger.nl/kennisnet/andere_wisselverwarming_kan_spoorchaos_voorkomen-142138  Treinreiziger (in Dutch) Larger cities in the Randstad have many railway stations, as well as light rail, subway and/or tram networks.  Cycling  Much effort is being expended in increasing the cycling rate of the Randstad. The campaign FietsfilevrijFietsfilevrij, official website. exists to encourage cycling as an alternative to waiting in traffic jams on the motorway. Bicycle \\"superhighways\\"Bicycle superhighways, website. have been built on which cyclists have priority for long distance, high speed cycle commuting. For instance, one of these stretches the 50 km distance between Amsterdam and Utrecht.

Their history shows how teams can move quickly between the levels through successive promotions or relegations. In sports leagues, promotion and relegation is a process where teams are transferred between multiple divisions based on their performance for the completed season. The best-ranked team(s) in the lower division are promoted to the higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are relegated to the lower division for the next season. In some leagues, playoffs or qualifying rounds are also used to determine rankings. This process can continue through several levels of divisions, with teams being exchanged between levels 1 and 2, levels 2 and 3, levels 3 and 4, and so on. During the season, teams that are high enough in the league table that they would qualify for promotion are sometimes said to be in the promotion zone, and those at the bottom are in the relegation zone (or, colloquially, the drop zone or facing the drop). An alternate system of league organisation which is used primarily in the US and Canada is a closed model based on licensing or franchises. This maintains the same teams from year to year, with occasional admission of expansion teams and relocation of existing teams, and with no team movement between the major league and minor leagues. Overview S√∂dert√§lje SK- Leksands IF during a 2007 Kvalserien game. SV Darmstadt 98 fans celebrated promotion to the German Bundesliga in 2015. ... while Preston North End fans mourned relegation to English League One in 2011. The number of teams exchanged between the divisions is almost always identical. Exceptions occur when the higher division wishes to change the size of its membership, or has lost one or more of its clubs (to financial insolvency or expulsion, for example) and wishes to restore its previous membership size, in which case fewer teams are relegated from that division, or (less often) more teams are accepted for promotion from the division below. Such variations usually cause a \\"knock-on\\" effect through the lower divisions. For example, in 1995 the Premier League voted to reduce its numbers by two and achieved the desired change by relegating four teams instead of the usual three, whilst allowing only two promotions from Football League Division One. Even in the absence of such extraordinary circumstances, the pyramid-like nature of most European sports league systems can still create knock-on effects at the regional level. For example, in a higher league with a large geographical footprint and multiple feeder leagues each representing smaller geographical regions, should most or all of the relegated teams in the higher division come from one particular region then the number of teams to be promoted or relegated from each of the feeder leagues may have to be adjusted, or one or more teams playing near the boundary between the feeder leagues may have to transfer from one feeder league to another to maintain numerical balance. The system is said to be the defining characteristic of the \\"European\\" form of professional sports league organization. Promotion and relegation have the effect of allowing the maintenance of a hierarchy of leagues and divisions, according to the relative strength of their teams. They also maintain the importance of games played by many low-ranked teams near the end of the season, which may be at risk of relegation. In contrast, a low-ranked US or Canadian team's final games serve little purpose, and in fact losing may be beneficial to such teams, yielding a better position in the next year's draft. Although not intrinsic to the system, problems can occur due to the differing monetary payouts and revenue-generating potential that different divisions provide to their clubs. For example, financial hardship has sometimes occurred in leagues where clubs do not reduce their wage bill once relegated. This usually occurs for one of two reasons: first, the club can't move underperforming players on, or second, the club is gambling on being promoted back straight away and is prepared to take a financial loss for one or two seasons to do so. Some leagues (most notably English football's Premier League) offer \\"parachute payments\\" to its relegated teams for the following year(s). \\"Football\\", The Guardian. Article discusses the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Football League] The payouts are higher than the prize money received by some non-relegated teams and are designed to soften the financial hit that clubs take whilst dropping out of the Premier League. However, in many cases these parachute payments just serve to inflate the costs of competing for promotion among the lower division clubs as newly relegated teams retain a financial advantage. In some countries and at certain levels, teams in line for promotion may have to satisfy certain non-playing conditions in order to be accepted by the higher league, such as financial solvency, stadium capacity, and facilities. If these are not satisfied, a lower-ranked team may be promoted in their place, or a team in the league above may be saved from relegation. While the primary purpose of the promotion/relegation system is to maintain competitive balance, it may also be used as a disciplinary tool in special cases. On several occasions, the Italian Football Federation has relegated clubs found to have been involved in match-fixing. This occurred most recently in 2006, when the season's initial champions Juventus were relegated to Serie B, and two other teams were initially relegated but then restored to Serie A after appeal (see 2006 Serie A scandal). In some Communist nations, particularly several in Europe after World War II, clubs were promoted and relegated for political reasons rather than performance; clubs in East Germany, Romania, and Yugoslavia were given top-flight placements by the Communist authorities from their beginnings, and often held onto their places with these authorities' backing. This was made evident in the late eighties especially by teams such as Romanian Steaua Bucure»ôti and Yugoslav Red Star Belgrade, both winners of the European Champions League despite the rampant level of corruption in their Communist local leagues. International sport Promotion and relegation may be used in international sports tournaments. In tennis, the Davis Cup and Fed Cup have promotion and relegation, with a 'World Group' (split into two divisions in the Fed Cup) at the top and series of regional groups at a lower level. The World Groups in both use a knockout tournament format, with the first-round losers entering play-offs with winners from regional groups to avoid relegation. In international tournaments, this format allows teams from countries in which a sport is less well established to have competitive matches, while opening up the possibility of competing against higher ranked nations as a sport grows. Other international tournaments which employ promotion and relegation include the Ice Hockey World Championships, Bandy World Championships, Floorball World Championships, the UEFA Nations League, the World Cricket League and the European Team Championships in athletics. Historical comparisons Early baseball leagues in the United States In baseball, the earliest American sport to develop professional leagues, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was established in 1857 as a national governing body for the game. In many respects, it would resemble England's Football Association when founded in 1863. Both espoused strict amateurism in their early years and welcomed hundreds of clubs as members. Baseball's National Association was not able to survive the onset of professionalism. It responded to the trend -- clubs secretly paying or indirectly compensating players -- by establishing a \\"professional\\" class for 1869. As quickly as 1871, most of those clubs broke away and formed the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). That new, professional Association was open at a modest fee, but it proved to be unstable. It was replaced by the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs in 1876, which has endured to the present day. The founders of the new League judged that in order to prosper, they must make baseball's highest level of competition a franchise based system with exclusive membership, a strict limit on the number of teams, and each member having exclusive rights to their local market. The modest National League guarantee of a place in the league year after year would permit the owners to monopolize fan bases in their exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, such as improved ballparks. In turn, those would guarantee the revenues to support traveling halfway across a continent for games. Indeed, after its first season, the new league banked on its still doubtful stability by expelling its members in New York and Philadelphia (the two largest cities), because they had breached agreements to visit the four western clubs at the end of the season. The NL's dominance of baseball was challenged several times but only by entire leagues, after its first few years. Eight clubs, the established norm for a national league, was a prohibitively high threshold for a new venture. Two challengers succeeded beyond the short-term, with the National League fighting off a challenge from the American Association after a decade (concluded 1891). In 1903 it accepted parity with the American League and the formation of the organization that would become Major League Baseball. The peace agreement between the NL and the AL did not change the \\"closed shop\\" of top-level baseball but entrenched it by including the AL in the shop. This was further confirmed by the Supreme Court's 1922 ruling in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, giving MLB a legal monopoly over professional baseball in the US. The other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada have followed the MLB model of a franchise based system. Early football leagues in England In contrast to baseball's NABBP, the first governing body in English football survived the onset of professionalism, which it formally accepted in 1885. Perhaps the great geographical concentration of population and the corresponding short distances between urban centres was crucial. Certainly it provided the opportunity for more clubs' developing large fan bases without incurring great travel costs. Professional football did not gain acceptance until after the turn of the 20th century in most of Southern England. The earliest league members travelled only through the Midlands and North. When The Football League (now the English Football League) was founded in 1888, it was not intended to be a rival of The Football Association but rather the top competition within it. The new league was not universally accepted as England's top-calibre competition right away. To help win fans of clubs outside The Football League, its circuit was not closed; rather, a system was established in which the worst teams at the end of each season would need to win re-election against any clubs wishing to join. A rival league, the Football Alliance, was formed in 1889. When the two merged in 1892, it was not on equal terms; rather, most of the Alliance clubs were put in the new Football League Second Division, whose best teams would move up to the First Division in place of its worst teams. Another merger, with the top division of the Southern League in 1920, helped form the Third Division in similar fashion. Since then no new league has been formed of non-league clubs to try to achieve parity with The Football League (only to play at a lower level, like independent professional leagues in American baseball today). For decades, teams finishing near the bottom of The Football League's lowest division(s) faced re-election rather than automatic relegation. But the principle of promotion and relegation had been firmly established, and it eventually expanded to the football pyramid in place today. Meanwhile, The FA has remained English football's overall governing body, retaining amateur and professional clubs rather than breaking up.  Use in other competitions  Promotion and relegation has been used in several eSports leagues. In the World Cyber Games realm, Blizzard Entertainment's video game StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty uses a seven-level promotion and relegation system for its tournament structure. Individual players and pre-made teams can be promoted and relegated during the first few weeks of a league season, which generally lasts around 11 weeks, with promotion and relegation taking place based on a hidden skill rating, which is in turn based on wins and losses. The most professional League of Legends leagues like the League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea use a promotion and relegation system, although the LCS moved away from this in 2018 for North America LCS and 2019 for the European LCS (which was renamed to the League of Legends European Championship). The Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Majors use a similar system where in the top eight finishers of one of the bi-annual Majors are designated with the \\"Legends\\" seed and automatically qualified for the next Major tournament. The best six eliminated teams in the second stage (known as New Legends Stage) of the Major must play a \\"qualifying\\" stage (known as New Challengers Stage) with another ten teams from the Minors in order to compete at the New Legends Stage. From 1993 until 2003, the Eurovision Song Contest used various systems of relegation to reconcile the number of countries wishing to participate (approximately 30 at the time) with the number of performances allowed considering time constraints of a live television program. The addition of a semi-final in 2004 allowed for more than 26 songs, but in 2008 automatic qualification of the previous year's top 10 to the final was removed.  Argentinian football and the average performance system  From 1957 to 1966 and from 1983 to the present, the Argentine First Division has used a system called Promedios based on the average performance over a number of seasons. Originally the previous two seasons, and later three or four seasons, clubs avoid relegation by having a high coefficient, which is obtained by dividing the points achieved in the last three seasons by the number of matches played in the same period. Teams with the lowest points coefficient at the end of the season are relegated to the Primera B Nacional. This system has both positive and negative aspects, since all of the matches played for the championship in the last seasons are included in the coefficient for the clubs. Teams have an incentive to score points in every match of the season, meaning teams that are not challenging for the title or fighting relegation in the current season want to win even in the final matches to reduce the risk of relegation in the next season; examples are Club Atl√©tico Banfield being champion of the Torneo Apertura in 2009 and last place in the next championship, the Torneo Clausura 2010, without being relegated until the end of the Torneo Apertura 2010 with a second-to-last place finish. Similarly, River Plate finished last in the Torneo Apertura 2008 and after two bad campaigns and a regular one was relegated in the Torneo Clausura 2011 despite being in fifth place and qualifying for the 2011 Copa Sudamericana. This system forces the newly promoted teams to fight relegation from the very beginning of the season. It also allows teams with a low budget with previous good campaigns to compete in international competitions without having to prioritize the championship to avoid relegation; examples of this are Club Atl√©tico Lan√∫s, winner of the 2013 Copa Sudamericana, or Club Atl√©tico Talleres, winner of the 1999 Conmebol Cup. The Uruguayan First Division adopted the same system in 2016. Also, a similar system was used only in the 1999 edition of Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A.

Operation Tempest was aimed at seizing control of cities and areas occupied by the Germans while they were preparing their defenses against the advancing Soviet Red Army. Polish underground civil authorities aimed at taking power before the arrival of the Soviets. Another goal for the Polish government in exile was to restore the borders of 1939 with the USSR, proclaiming the rejection of the border according to the Curzon line. \\"The Polish Cabinet believed that by refusing to accept the Curzon Line they were defending their country's right to existence as a national entity. They were determined that Russo-Polish relations should be restored on the basis of the pre-1939 territorial arrangements\\".Jan. M. Ciechanowski. The Warsaw Rising of 1944. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. London. 1974. p.9 History From its inception the Home Army had been preparing a national armed rising against the Germans. The basic framework of the future rising was created in September 1942. According to the plan, the Uprising was to be ordered by the Polish Commander-in-Chief in exile when the defeat of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front became apparent. The Uprising was to begin in Central Poland: in the \\"General Gouvernement\\", Zag≈Çƒôbie, Krak√≥w Voivodeship, and the Bia≈Çystok and Brze≈õƒá areas. The Uprising's basic objectives were to: # end the German occupation; # seize arms and supplies needed for a Polish regular army on Polish soil; # counter the threat from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia); # rebuild a regular Polish Army; # rebuild civil authority, communications, and an arms industry; # maintain peace and order behind the front lines; and # begin offensive operations against Wehrmacht forces still on Polish soil. Captain \\"Mruk\\" of the Radom‚ÄìKielce area Home Army, with a Soviet reconnaissance patrol Reconstruction of a Polish regular army was to be based on the prewar Polish order of battle. Home Army units were to be turned into regular divisions. Initially to be created were 16 infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades and one motorized brigade, to be equipped with captured weapons or with arms and supplies delivered by the Allies. The second phase was to see the re-building of an additional 15 divisions and 5 cavalry brigades which, before World War II, had been stationed in eastern and western Poland. The plan was partly implemented. Beginning in 1943, Home Army units were grouped into larger units bearing the names and numbers of prewar Polish divisions, brigades and regiments. \\"Allies of our allies\\" In early 1943, after the German defeat at Stalingrad, it became clear that the Soviets would be the force the Home Army would most likely have to deal with and that the planned Polish rising would face a still powerful German army rather than units retreating to an already defeated homeland. In February 1943, the Home Army chief, General Stefan Rowecki, amended the plan. The Uprising would take place in three stages. The first stage would be an armed rising in the east (with main centers of resistance at Lw√≥w and Vilnius) in advance of the approaching Red Army. In preparation, the \\"Wachlarz\\" organization was formed. The second stage would be an armed struggle in the zone between the Curzon Line and the Vistula River; and the third stage would be a national rising over the rest of Poland. On April 25, 1943, Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations were broken off by Joseph Stalin due to Polish inquiries about the Katyn massacres, and it became clear that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General Rowecki put it, \\"our allies' ally.\\" On November 26, 1943, the Polish government in exile issued instructions that, if diplomatic relations had not resumed with the Soviet Union before the Soviets entered Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions. The Home Army's commander on the ground, however, took a different approach, and on November 30, 1943, a final version of the plan was drafted. Overview of the operation Polish Home Army's 7th Infantry Division, from the Radom‚ÄìKielce area, during Operation Tempest The plan was to cooperate with the advancing Red Army on a tactical level, while Polish civil authorities came out from underground and took power in Allied-controlled Polish territory. This plan was approved by the Delegate of the government-in-exile and by the Polish underground parliament (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna). On January 2, 1944, Red Army forces of the 2nd Belarusian Front crossed the prewar Polish border and Operation Tempest began. The Division managed to contact the commanders of the advancing Red Army and began successful joint operations against the Wehrmacht. Together they retook Kowel (April 6) and W≈Çodzimierz. The Division was, however, soon forced to retreat west, and in the Polesie area was attacked by both German and Soviet forces. Polish soldiers taken prisoner by the Soviets were given the choice of joining the Red Army or being sent to Soviet forced-labor camps. The remnants of the Division crossed the Bug River, where they were attacked by Soviet partisan units. After liberating the towns of Lubart√≥w and Kock, the Division (reduced to some 3,200 men) was surrounded by the Red Army and taken prisoner.  Operation Tempest in different regions of Poland   Southeast Volhynia  Operation Tempest began in Volhynia, a region which until 1939 had belonged to the Second Polish Republic (see Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship (1921‚Äì39)), in January 1944, after the Red Army had entered prewar Polish territory east of the town of Sarny on January 4. The operation, which was mainly carried out by the 27th Home Army Infantry Division (Poland) (some 6500 soldiers) was aimed at the Wehrmacht units, still operating in the region. * January 4, 1944: the Red Army enters Volhynia east of Sarny * January 15: a mobilization of ethnic Poles takes place in the area of Kowel and W≈Çodzimierz Wo≈Çy≈Ñski * January 28: the 27th Volhynian Home Army Infantry Division is officially created * February 10: Colonel Jan Wojciech Kiwerski is named commandant of the Volhynian District of the Home Army * March 4: first Home Army unit meets the advancing Red Army * March 17: a Wehrmacht company is disarmed at the village of Zasmyki near Kowel * March 18: first skirmishes against Germans take place * March 20‚Äì27: heavy battles in the Turia river valley * March 23: a German detachment is disarmed at Stezarzyce * March 24: a skirmish near Kapitulka * March 26: Colonel Kiwerski meets Soviet General Sergeev * April 1944: heavy fighting with the Wehrmacht west of Kowel. Due to German superiority, on April 12 Polish forces try to get in touch with the Red Army, after a failed attempt to capture W≈Çodzimierz Wo≈Çy≈Ñski. Eventually, the division is surrounded, and on April 18, its commandant, Colonel Kiwerski, was killed in action. On April 21 the unit escapes the encirclement, and after several skirmishes, on June 10 it crosses the Bug River, entering Lesser Poland. The division then took part in Operation Tempest in the region of Lublin, remaining active until late July 1944. All together, between January and June 1944, the 27th Volhynian ID of the Home Army took part in over 100 skirmishes, losing over 600 soldiers. German and Hungarian losses are estimated at up to 750 KIA and 900 wounded. Northeast Operation Ostra Brama In the north, on July 7, 1944, the forces of the Wilno and Nowogr√≥dek Home Army districts (some 13,000 men under Colonel Aleksander Krzy≈ºanowski) launched an attack on German-held Vilnius, although the attack stalled until the arrival of Soviet forces. The AK and Soviet armies then jointly took the city on July 13. Prior to the assault, the surrounding countryside had also been liberated by Polish and Soviet partisans. Cooperation ended almost immediately after the liberation of Vilnius; on July 14, Krzy≈ºanowski and his officers were disarmed and imprisoned, and AK units who resisted being disarmed were violently crushed by Soviet forces, with dozens of Polish fatalities.W≈Çodzimierz Borodziej, Barbara Harshav (transl.), The Warsaw uprising of 1944. University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. Lw√≥w Uprising On July 23, Home Army forces in Lw√≥w (now Lviv) began an armed rising in cooperation with advancing Soviet forces. In four days the city was liberated. The Polish civil and military authorities were then summoned to \\"a meeting with Red Army commanders\\" and taken prisoner by the Soviet NKVD. Colonel W≈Çadys≈Çaw Filipkowski's men were forcibly conscripted into the Red Army, sent to forced-labor camps, or went back underground.  Polesie  Operation Tempest in Polesie took place in the final days of German occupation of this region. Due to rapid Soviet advance westwards (see Operation Bagration), it lasted for two weeks (July 15‚Äì30, 1944), mainly in the western part of Polesie, near Brzesc nad Bugiem, Kobryn and Bereza Kartuska, but also in the area of Pinsk. The Home Army headquarters gave orders for the 30th Home Army Infantry Division to be created in Polesie. This unit was tasked with capturing the areas north and east of Brzesc. The division concentrated in forested areas along the Nurzec river, with some 1000 soldiers. On July 17, a Wehrmacht motorized transport was attacked near the folwark of Adampol, and a skirmish with the Germans took place near the village of Wyzary. On July 30, 1944, Polish forces made contact with Red Army‚Äôs 65th Army: Soviet officers ordered the Poles to merge with First Polish Army. Poles disobeyed this order, and headed towards Bia≈Ça Podlaska, where they decided to march to Warsaw, and fight in the Warsaw Uprising. Near Otwock, the division was surrounded and disarmed by the Soviets. Warsaw Uprising Polish Home Army's 26th Infantry Regiment en route from the Kielce‚ÄìRadom area to Warsaw in an attempt to join the Warsaw Uprising Seeing the fate of the Home Army forces that had taken part in Operation Tempest, the Polish government in exile and the Home Army's current commander, General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski, decided that the last chance for regaining Poland's independence was to open an uprising in Warsaw. On July 21, 1944, B√≥r- Komorowski ordered that the Warsaw Uprising begin at 17:00 hours on August 1, 1944. The political goal was to emphasize for the Allies the existence of the Polish government and Polish civil authorities. Warsaw was to be taken in order to allow the legitimate Polish government to return from exile to Poland. At the same time, other Home Army districts were also mobilized. Units of the Krak√≥w area were preparing an uprising, similar to the one in Wilno, Lw√≥w and Warsaw, but it was cancelled due to several reasons (see: Krak√≥w Uprising (1944)). In the Kielce and Radom area, the 2nd Polish Home Army Division was formed and took control of the entire area except for the cities. Other units were also mustered in Krak√≥w, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Greater Poland.  Bia≈Çystok  Operation Tempest in Bia≈Çystok and its area began in the second half of July 1944, and lasted until late September. The Home Army recreated here four units, based on interbellum Polish Army: 18th and 29th Infantry Divisions, also Suwalki and Podlaska Cavalry Brigades. All together, some 7,000 soldiers fought in over 200 battles and skirmishes. The operation was commanded by Colonel Wladyslaw Liniarski. First unit to enter the fighting was 81st Home Army Infantry Regiment, which operated in the forests around Grodno. Armed with light weapons, the regiment was too weak to capture the city of Grodno, and limited its activities to fighting German outposts and police stations. In the outskirts of Bia≈Çystok, among Polish forces concentrated in the Knyszyn Wilderness were: 42nd Home Army Infantry Regiment, and 10th Home Army Uhlan Regiment. The 2nd Home Army Uhlan Regiment operated in the area of Bransk and Hajn√≥wka. This unit destroyed the rail line between Hajn√≥wka and Czeremcha, including a rail bridge, which was blown up. The 76th Home Army Infantry Regiment fought in the area of Ciechanowiec and Lapy Three Home Army regiments were formed in the August√≥w Primeval Forest: 1st Home Army Uhlan Regiment (with 300 soldiers), 41st Home Army Infantry Regiment and 3rd Regiment (all together: 700 soldiers). Fearing a partisan attack, the Germans declared state of emergency in the town of Augustow. During Operation Tempest in this part of Bia≈Çystok Province, over 30 raids of different kinds took place, in which 4 military transports were blown up, along the rail line from Augustow to Grodno. Home Army forces cooperated with the Red Army. On August 6, a unit of 300 soldiers managed to get through German lines, and into the areas controlled by the Soviets. By autumn 1944, most regiments had ceased operations. Last skirmish in this area took place on November 2 near the village of Nowinka. In the forests surrounding the Osowiec Fortress, 9th Home Army Mounted Rifles were concentrated under Wiktor Konopka. In July and August 1944, this regiment fought the Germans in several locations. On September 8, after a heavy battle, the unit was destroyed by the enemy. Survivors managed to cross the frontline, which at that time was along the Biebrza river. In the area of ≈Åom≈ºa, the 33rd Home Army Infantry Regiment was created, with three battalions. It fought rear German units, breaking communication links between frontline and East Prussia. Near the village of Czarnowo-Undy, some 150 Soviet prisoners of war were released by the Poles. As a reprisal, the Germans burned the village, shooting all its residents (July 22, 1944). On August 20, the 5th Home Army Uhlan Regiment, which operated in the area of Ostro≈Çƒôka, attacked a German artillery battery near the village of Labedy.  Lublin  Operation Tempest in the area of Lublin took place in the final two weeks of July 1944. The Home Army created there such units, as 3rd Infantry Division, 9th Infantry Division, 15th Infantry Regiment, also units of Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie and other resistance organizations, plus 27th Home Army Infantry Division (Poland) from the province of Volhynia. All together, Polish forces in the region had some 20,000 men. The partisans attacked retreating German forces along railways and roads in the whole district of Lublin. In several cases, they defended villages pacified by the Wehrmacht and the SS. Poles cooperated with Red Army guerillas, which also operated in the area. In the south (the region of Zamo≈õƒá), 9th Infantry Regiment under Major Stanislaw Prus liberated the town of Be≈Ç≈ºec (July 21). Together with the Soviets, they captured Tomasz√≥w Lubelski. German forces were attacked in several locations, including Frampol and Zwierzyniec. On July 21 and 22, Volhynian 27th Division captured Kock, Lubart√≥w and Firlej. In western part of the province, 8th and 15th Infantry Regiments liberated a number of towns: Kur√≥w, Urzƒôd√≥w, Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w, Garb√≥w, WƒÖwolnica, Sobolew, Ryki, Ko≈Ñskowola. On July 26, Polish units cooperated with Soviet forces fighting for Pu≈Çawy. Several German rail transports were destroyed, and Polish soldiers saved Ko≈Ñskowola from Germans, who planned to set the town on fire.  Krak√≥w  Home Army District of Krak√≥w was one of the largest districts of the organization. It spread from Przemy≈õl to Krak√≥w itself, and first fighting in the area took place in the east. In Rzeszow and Przemysl, 22nd and 24th Home Army Divisions were mobilized. In Rzesz√≥w, Mielec and Krosno, 10th Home Army Cavalry Brigade was created. In the west, 6th and 106th Home Army Infantry Divisions were created, also Krak√≥w Brigade of Motorized Cavalry. Other units active in the region were: Independent Battalion of Major Jan Panczakiewicz and Operational Group Krak√≥w under Colonel Edward Godlewski. The Home Army considered an armed insurrection in the city of Krak√≥w, but this plan was abandoned (see Krak√≥w Uprising (1944)).  Radom‚ÄìKielce  Operation Tempest in Radom and Kielce began on August 1, 1944, and lasted until October 6. The Home Army here created 2nd, 7th and 28th Infantry Divisions, with several other units. The purpose of the operation was to aid the Red Army with its capture of eastern bank of the Vistula and cities of the region. Polish partisans planned to defend the Vistula bridges, and armament factories in Starachowice and Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna. After the Red Army had managed to cross the Vistula and capture bridgeheads at Sandomierz and Magnuszew (see Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive), Home Army got in touch with the Soviets, and began cooperating with them. In Kozienice and Sandomierz, Polish units supported the advancing Soviets: in the night of July 31 / August 1, 1944, a German counterattack was halted by Polish 2nd Infantry Regiment of Captain Michal Mandziara, which helped the Soviets keep their positions in the Sandomierz Bridgehead. On August 3, Polish and Soviet forces liberated Stasz√≥w; in the following days, Poles, helped by Soviet tanks, captured Stopnica and Busko. On August 14, 1944, General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski ordered all units of the Kielce ‚Äì Radom area to march towards Warsaw, and join Warsaw Uprising. Operation Revenge, as it was called, resulted in creation of Kielce Corps of the Home Army, under Colonel Jan Zientarski, with 6,430 soldiers. On August 21, during its concentration, the Corps saved residents of the village of Antoniow, which was raided by Germans. Even though Kielce Corps began its march towards Warsaw, it did not reach Polish capital. After careful analysis of German forces concentrated around Warsaw, Home Army leaders decided to halt the operation, as it was too risky. Poles did not have heavy weapons and tanks to face the enemy on equal terms. Operation Revenge was abandoned, and the Corps was dissolved. In early September 1944, local units of the Home Army planned to capture either Kielce or Radom, also there were plans to seize Czƒôstochowa and Skarzysko. 7th Infantry Division was transferred westwards, to the area of Czƒôstochowa. 2nd Infantry remained near Kielce, actively fighting the enemy until November. In late October 1944, Operation Tempest was cancelled. All units were dissolved.  ≈Å√≥d≈∫  Operation Tempest in the area of the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ took place in summer and autumn of 1944, lasting from August 14 until November 26. Local Home Army mobilized here several units, such as 25th Infantry Regiment under Major Rudolf Majewski. This regiment was stationed in forests near Przysucha: in August 1944, it carried out a number of attacks on German forces, destroying rail lines. Last battle of the 25th regiment took place on November 8, all together it lost 130 men. Among other units were 29th Kaniow Rifles Regiment, which operated near Brzeziny. On September 14, it captured a German warehouse at the station of S≈Çotwiny near Koluszki.  Outcome  Sambor command of Drohobycz Armia Krajowa inspectorate during Operation Tempest The Germans' suppression of the Warsaw Uprising, in the absence of Soviet assistance to the insurgents, marked the end of Operation Tempest. Joseph Stalin would not let the Polish government in exile return and instead created a puppet Moscow-backed government, while arresting or killing Home Army personnel and members of the civil authorities. The Germans' strategic priority was now focused to the south, on the oil fields in Romania. In autumn 1944 many Home Army units were disbanded, while remaining forces returned underground.

Cicada killers are large, solitary wasps in the family Crabronidae. The name may be applied to any species of crabronid which preys on cicadas, though in North America it is typically applied to a single species, S. speciosus. However, since there are multiple species of related wasps, it is more appropriate to call it the eastern cicada killer. This species occurs in the eastern and midwest U.S. and southwards into Mexico and Central America. They are so named because they hunt cicadas and provision their nests with them. In North America they are sometimes called sand hornets, although they are not hornets, which belong to the family Vespidae. Cicada killers exert a measure of natural control on cicada populations and thus may directly benefit the deciduous trees upon which their cicada feed. The most recent review of this species' biology is found in the posthumously published comprehensive study by noted entomologist Howard Ensign Evans.  Description  Five female eastern cicada killers, Sphecius speciosus Adult eastern cicada-killer wasps are large, long, robust wasps with hairy, reddish and black areas on the thorax (middle part), and are black to reddish brown marked with light yellow stripes on the abdominal (rear) segments. The wings are brownish. Coloration superficially resembles that of some yellowjacket and hornet species. The females are somewhat larger than the males, and both are among the largest wasps seen in the Eastern United States, their unusual size giving them a uniquely fearsome appearance. European hornets (Vespa crabro) are often mistaken for Eastern cicada killers, though at about long they are smaller than the largest cicada killers. The males are smaller than the females because only the females must carry the cicadas they have killed to a burrow for nesting. Life cycle and habits A female Sphecius speciosus digging a burrow next to a driveway Eastern cicada- killer wasp holding a paralyzed cicada at John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge Solitary wasps (such as the eastern cicada killer) are very different in their behavior from the social wasps such as hornets, yellowjackets, and paper wasps. Cicada killer females use their sting to paralyze their prey (cicadas) rather than to defend their nests; unlike most social wasps and bees, they do not attempt to sting unless handled roughly. Adults feed on flower nectar and other plant sap exudates. Adults emerge in summer, typically beginning around late June or early July and die off in September or October. They are present in a given area for 60 to 75 days, usually until mid-September. The large females are commonly seen skimming around lawns seeking good sites to dig burrows and searching for cicadas in trees and taller shrubs. The males are more often seen in groups, vigorously challenging one another for position on the breeding aggregation from which they emerged, and generally investigate anything that moves or flies near them. It is not unusual to see two or three male wasps locked together in apparent midair combat, the aggregate adopting an erratic flight path until one of the wasps breaks away. The male wasp's aggressive behavior is similar to that of another robust insect of the area, the male carpenter bee. In both cases, while the males' vigorous territorial defense can be frightening and intimidating to human passersby, the males pose no danger whatsoever. Male cicada killers will only grapple with other insects, and cannot sting. Cicada killer infestation: the reddish brown patches are cicada killer burrows. This ground-burrowing wasp may be found in well-drained, sandy soils to loose clay in bare or grass-covered banks, berms and hills as well as next to raised sidewalks, driveways and patio slabs. Females may share a burrow, digging their own nest cells off the main tunnel. A typical burrow is deep and about wide. In digging a burrow, the female dislodges the soil with her jaws and, using her hind legs, pushes loose soil behind her as she backs out of the burrow. Her hind legs are equipped with special spines that help her push the dirt behind her. The excess soil pushed out of the burrow forms a mound with a trench through it at the burrow entrance. Cicada killers may nest in planters, window boxes, flower beds or under shrubs, ground cover, etc. Nests often are made in the full sun where vegetation is sparse. Video: hauling a cicada up a tree After digging a nest chamber in the burrow, female cicada killers capture cicadas, paralyzing them with a sting. After paralyzing a cicada, the female wasp holds it upside down beneath her and takes off toward her burrow; this return flight to the burrow is difficult for the wasp because the cicada is often more than twice her weight. A wasp will often lug its prey up into the nearest tree, to gain altitude for the flight to the burrow. After putting one or more cicadas in her nest cell, the female deposits an egg on a cicada and closes the cell with dirt. Male eggs are laid on a single cicada but female eggs are given two or sometimes three cicadas; this is because the female wasp is twice as large as the male and must have more food. New nest cells are dug as necessary off of the main burrow tunnel and a single burrow may eventually have 10 or more nest cells. The egg hatches in one or two days, and the cicadas serve as food for the grub. The larvae complete their development in about 2 weeks. Overwintering occurs as a mature larva within an earth-coated cocoon. Pupation occurs in the nest cell in the spring and lasts 25 to 30 days. There is only one generation per year and no adults overwinter. This wasp is frequently attacked by the parasitic \\"velvet ant\\" wasp, Dasymutilla occidentalis, also known as the \\"cow-killer\\" wasp. It lays an egg in the nest cell of the cicada killer, and when the cicada killer larva pupates, the parasitoid larva consumes the pupa.  Interaction with humans  A male eastern cicada killer guarding his territory and looking for females with which to mate Although cicada killers are large, female cicada-killer wasps are not aggressive and rarely sting unless they are grasped roughly, stepped upon with bare feet, or caught in clothing. One author who has been stung indicates that, for him, the stings are not much more than a \\"pinprick\\". Males aggressively defend their perching areas on nesting sites against rival males but they have no stinger. Although they appear to attack anything that moves near their territories, male cicada killers are actually investigating anything that might be a female cicada killer ready to mate. Such close inspection appears to many people to be an attack, but male and female cicada killers do not land on people with the intent to sting. If handled roughly, females will sting, and males will jab with a sharp spine on the tip of their abdomen. Both sexes are well equipped to bite, as they have large jaws, but they do not appear to grasp human skin and bite. They are generally not aggressive towards humans and usually fly away when swatted at, rather than attacking.  Other cicada- killer wasps  The North American cicada-killer wasps all belong to the genus Sphecius, of which there are 21 species worldwide. The remaining three cicada- killing species in the genus in North America are: * Sphecius convallis, the Pacific cicada killer, occurs in the western U.S. and in Mexico. * Sphecius grandis, the western cicada killer, occurs in the mid- and western U.S. and in Mexico. * Sphecius hogardii, the Caribbean cicada killer, occurs in the U.S. in Florida and in the Caribbean. It is suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. There is also evidence to suggest that the eastern cicada killer has either a subspecies or a closely related species that mimics the Pacific cicada killer. Alternatively, when they were already distinct species, significant hybridization has occurred between them, though not enough to fully overcome their present reproductive isolation. The spectacled cicada killer, Sphecius spectabilis (Taschenberg, 1875), is found in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, Surinam and Venezuela. Sixteen other cicada-killer wasp species in the genus Sphecius are found in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. There are also other genera of cicada-killing wasps (e.g., Liogorytes in South America and Exeirus in Australia) which are the \\"cicada killers\\" of their native lands.

The group G_2 is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups. It can be described as the automorphism group of the octonions, or equivalently, as a proper subgroup of special orthogonal group SO(7) that preserves a spinor in the eight-dimensional spinor representation or lastly as the subgroup of the general linear group GL(7) which preserves the non-degenerate 3-form \\\\phi, the associative form. The Hodge dual, \\\\psi=*\\\\phi is then a parallel 4-form, the coassociative form. These forms are calibrations in the sense of Reese Harvey and H. Blaine Lawson,. and thus define special classes of 3- and 4-dimensional submanifolds.  Properties  Any G_2-manifold is: * 7-dimensional, * Ricci-flat, * orientable, and * a spin manifold. In addition, any compact manifold with holonomy equal to G_2 has *finite fundamental group, *non-zero first Pontryagin class, and *non-zero third and fourth Betti numbers.  History  The fact that G_2 might possibly be the holonomy group of certain Riemannian 7-manifolds was first suggested by the 1955 classification theorem of Marcel Berger, and this remained consistent with the simplified proof later given by Jim Simons in 1962. Although not a single example of such a manifold had yet been discovered, Edmond Bonan nonetheless made a useful contribution by showing that, if such a manifold did in fact exist, it would carry both a parallel 3-form and a parallel 4-form, and that it would necessarily be Ricci- flat.. The first local examples of 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 were finally constructed around 1984 by Robert Bryant, and his full proof of their existence appeared in the Annals in 1987.. Next, complete (but still noncompact) 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 were constructed by Bryant and Simon Salamon in 1989.. The first compact 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 were constructed by Dominic Joyce in 1994. Compact G_2 manifolds are therefore sometimes known as \\"Joyce manifolds\\", especially in the physics literature.. In 2013, it was shown by M. Firat Arikan, Hyunjoo Cho, and Sema Salur that any manifold with a spin structure, and, hence, a G_2-structure, admits a compatible almost contact metric structure, and an explicit compatible almost contact structure was constructed for manifolds with G_2-structure.. In the same paper, it was shown that certain classes of G_2-manifolds admit a contact structure. In 2015, a new construction of compact G_2 manifolds, due to Alessio Corti, Mark Haskins, Johannes Nordstr≈ëm, and Tommaso Pacini, combined a gluing idea suggested by Simon Donaldson with new algebro-geometric and analytic techniques for constructing Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds with cylindrical ends, resulting in tens of thousands of diffeomorphism types of new examples.  Connections to physics  These manifolds are important in string theory. They break the original supersymmetry to 1/8 of the original amount. For example, M-theory compactified on a G_2 manifold leads to a realistic four- dimensional (11-7=4) theory with N=1 supersymmetry. The resulting low energy effective supergravity contains a single supergravity supermultiplet, a number of chiral supermultiplets equal to the third Betti number of the G_2 manifold and a number of U(1) vector supermultiplets equal to the second Betti number.

Historically, light infantry often fought as scouts, raiders and skirmishers‚Äîsoldiers who fight in a loose formation ahead of the main army to harass, delay, disrupt supply lines, and generally \\"soften up\\" an enemy before the main battle. After World War II, the term \\"light infantry\\" evolved, and now generally refers to rapid-deployment units (including commandos and airborne units) that specifically emphasize speed and mobility over armor and firepower. Some units or battalions that historically held a skirmishing role have kept their designation \\"light infantry\\" for the sake of tradition. History Ancient history Agrianian peltast, The concept of a skirmishing screen is a very old one and was already well- established in Ancient Greece and Roman times in the form, for example, of the Greek peltast and psiloi, and the Roman velites. As with the so-called \\"light infantry\\" of later periods, the term more adequately describes the role of such infantry rather than the actual weight of their equipment. Peltast equipment, for example, grew steadily heavier at the same time as hoplite equipment grew lighter. It was the fact that peltasts fought in open order as skirmishers that made them light infantry and that hoplites fought in the battle line in a phalanx formation that made them heavy infantry. Modern history Early regular armies of the modern era frequently relied on irregulars to perform the duties of light infantry skirmishers. In particular, the French Army employed detachments of German and Balkan mercenaries to serve as patrols in the rough country until a permanent corps of Mountain Fusiliers (Fusiliers des Montagnes) was raised in the 1740s. In the 17th century, dragoons were sometimes employed as the skirmishers of their day ‚Äì mounted infantrymen who rode into battle but dismounted to fight, giving them a mobility lacking to regular foot soldiers. In the 18th and 19th centuries most infantry regiments or battalions had a light company as an integral part of its composition. Its members were often smaller, more agile men with high shooting ability and capability of using initiative. They did not usually fight in disciplined ranks as did the ordinary infantry but often in widely dispersed groups, necessitating an understanding of skirmish warfare. They were expected to avoid melee engagements unless necessary and would fight ahead of the mainline to harass the enemy before falling back to the main position. During the period 1777‚Äì1781, the Continental Army of the United States adopted the British Army practice of seasonally drafting light infantry regiments as temporary units during active field operations, by combining existing light infantry companies detached from their parent regiments. French light infantry in the woods during the Napoleonic era, by Victor Huen. Light infantry sometimes carried lighter muskets than ordinary infantrymen while others carried rifles and wore rifle green uniforms. These became designated as rifle regiments in Britain and J√§ger and Sch√ºtzen (sharpshooter) regiments in German-speaking Europe. In France, during the Napoleonic Wars, light infantry were called voltigeurs and chasseurs and the sharpshooters tirailleurs. The Austrian army had Grenzer regiments from the middle of the 18th century, who originally served as irregular militia skirmishers recruited from mountainous frontier areas. They were gradually absorbed into the line infantry becoming a hybrid type that proved successful against the French, to the extent that Napoleon recruited several units of Austrian army Grenzer to his own army after victory over Austria in 1809 compelled the Austrians to cede territories from which they were traditionally recruited. In Portugal, 1797, companies of Ca√ßadores (Hunters) were created in the Portuguese Army, and in 1808 led to the formation of independent \\"Ca√ßador\\" battalions that became known for their ability to perform precision shooting at long distances. Light infantry officers sometimes carried muskets or rifles, rather than pistols, and their swords were light curved sabres; as opposed to the heavy, straighter swords of other infantry officers. Orders were sent by bugle or whistle instead of drum (since the sound of a bugle carries further and it is difficult to move fast when carrying a drum). Some armies, including the British and French, recruited whole regiments (or converted existing ones) of light infantry. These were considered elite units, since they required specialised training with emphasis on self-discipline, manoeuvre and initiative to carry out the roles of light infantry as well as those of ordinary infantry. By the late 19th century the concept of fighting in formation was on the wane due to advancements in weaponry and the distinctions between light and heavy infantry began to disappear. Essentially, all infantry became light infantry in operational practice. Some regiments retained the name and customs, but there was in effect little difference between them and other infantry regiments. On the eve of World War I the British Army included seven light infantry regiments. These differed from other infantry only in maintaining such traditional distinctions as badges that included a bugle- horn, dark green home service helmets for full dress, and a fast-stepping parade ground march.Maj. R. M.Barnes, pp.298‚Äì305 \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\\", Sphere Books 1972 Contemporary Georgian 23rd Light Infantry Battalion (joined by a few US Marines) on joint military exercise, 2005 Today the term \\"light\\" denotes, in the United States table of organization and equipment, units lacking heavy weapons and armor or with a reduced vehicle footprint. Light infantry units lack the greater firepower, operational mobility and protection of mechanized or armored units, but possess greater tactical mobility and the ability to execute missions in severely restrictive terrain and in areas where weather makes vehicular mobility difficult. Light infantry forces typically rely on their ability to operate under restrictive conditions, surprise, violence of action, training, stealth, field craft, and fitness levels of the individual soldiers to address their reduced lethality. Despite the usage of the term \\"light\\", forces in a light unit will normally carry heavier individual loads versus other forces; they must carry everything they require to fight, survive and win due to lack of vehicles. Although units like the 101st Airborne (Air Assault) and the 82nd Airborne Division are categorized as Air Assault Infantry and Airborne Infantry respectively, they fall under the overall concept of light infantry. They are typically infantry intended for difficult terrain such as mountains or arctic conditions (US Marines) (Royal Marines, United States Army 10th Mountain Division, United States Army 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Mountain), Italian Army Alpini, French Army 27√®me bataillon de chasseurs alpins) or jungle (Philippine Army Scout Rangers, Brazilian Army Jungle Infantry Brigades). In the 1980s, the United States Army increased light forces to address contingencies and increased threats requiring a more deployable force able to operate in restrictive environments for limited periods. At its height, this included the 6th Infantry Division (light), 7th Infantry Division (light), 10th Mountain Division (light infantry), 25th Infantry Division, and the 75th Ranger Regiment. Operation Just Cause is often cited as proof of concept. Almost 30,000 U.S. Forces, mostly light, deployed to Panama within a 48-hour period to execute combat operations. On 30 September 1985, the 29th Infantry Division (Maryland and Virginia Army National Guard) was reactivated at Fort Belvoir, Virginia as the only light Infantry Division in the US Army's reserve components. During the Falklands War in 1982, both Argentina and the United Kingdom made heavy use of light infantry and its doctrines during the campaign, most notably the Argentine 5th Naval Infantry Battalion (Argentina) and 25th Infantry Regiment (Argentina) and the British Parachute Regiment and Royal Marines of 3 Commando Brigade. Due to the rocky and mountainous terrain of the Falkland Islands, operations on the ground were only made possible with the use of light infantry because the use of mechanized infantry or armour was severely limited by of the terrain, leading to the \\"Yomp\\" across the Falklands, in which Royal Marines and Paras yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering 56 miles (90 km) in three days carrying 80-pound (36 kg) loads after disembarking from ships at San Carlos on East Falkland, on 21 May 1982. During the 1990s, the concept of purely light forces in the US military came under scrutiny due to their decreased lethality and survivability. This scrutiny has resulted in the Stryker Brigade Combat Team, a greater focus on task organized units (such as Marine Expeditionary Units) and a reduction of purely light forces. Despite their reduction, light forces have proven successful in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom), underlining the continued need for light infantry.

France =Ancien r√©gime= The Chasseur designation was given to certain regiments of French light infantry (Chasseurs √† pied) or light cavalry (Chasseurs √† cheval). The Chasseurs √† pied (light infantry) were originally recruited from hunters or woodsmen. The Chasseurs √† Pied, as the marksmen of the French army, were considered an elite. The first unit raised was Jean Chr√©tien Fischer's Free Hunter Company in 1743. Early units were often a mix of cavalry and infantry. In 1776, all Chasseurs units were re- organized into six battalions, each linked to a cavalry regiment (Chasseurs √† cheval). In 1788, the link between infantry battalions and cavalry regiments was broken. =Revolution and Napoleon= Chasseurs from a light infantry regiment of Napol√©on's Grande Arm√©e In 1793, the Ancien R√©gime's Chasseur battalions were merged with volunteer battalions in new units called Light Infantry half-brigades (demi-brigades d‚Äôinfanterie l√©g√®re). In 1803, the half- brigades were renamed regiments. These units had three battalions of three regular Chasseurs companies, one elite Carabiniers company and one reconnaissance voltigeurs company. In Napol√©on's Imperial Guard, many units used names linked to light infantry: * Chasseurs √† pied: three regiments (1809‚Äì1815; 1815‚Äì1815; 1815‚Äì1815). The regiments were the elite of the light infantry regiments. * Fusilier-Chasseurs: a single regiment, originally the first Guard Fusilier Regiment (1809‚Äì1815) * Voltigeurs: 16 regiments, originally two regiments of Tirailleurs-chasseur and two regiments of Conscrits-chasseurs (1810‚Äì1815), then twelve new regiments (1811‚Äì1815). These regiments were expected to become Chasseurs √† pieds. * Flanqueurs-Chasseurs: two regiments, from drafted Forest Service members (1811‚Äì1815; 1813‚Äì1815) =19th century= Chasseurs √† pied bugler, full dress, 1885. The Napoleonic light infantry regiments existed until 1854, but there were very few differences between them and the line infantry regiments, so the 25 remaining light infantry regiments were transformed to line infantry in 1854. * Chasseurs √† pied: The Duke of Orl√©ans, heir to the throne, created in 1838 a new light infantry unit, the Tirailleurs battalion. It soon became, under the name Chasseur √† Pied, the main light infantry unit in the French Army. The number of battalions grew up steadily through the century. The current Chasseurs battalions drew their lineage form this unit. * Chasseurs alpins: Some of Chasseurs √† pied battalions were converted to specialized mountain units as Bataillons de Chasseurs Alpins in 1888, as an answer to the Italian Alpine (Alpini) regiments stationed along the Alpine frontier. * Chasseurs Forestiers: The Chasseurs forestiers (Forest Huntsmen) were militarized units of the Forest Service. They were organized in companies. They existed between 1875 and 1924. *Infanterie L√©g√®re d'Afrique (African Light Infantry) were penal battalions forming part of the French forces serving in North Africa. These units were recruited mainly from convicted military criminals from all branches of the French Army, who had finished their sentences in military prisons but still had time to serve before their engagement periods were finished.Jacques Sicard, page 46 \\"Les Bataillons d' Infanterie Legere d'Afrique et leurs insignes, 1832‚Äì1972\\", Militaria Magazine Septembre 1994 * Zouaves: The Zouaves battalions and regiments were colonial troops, formed originally by Algerians, then by European settlers and colonists. The first Zouave battalion was created in 1831 and changed its recruiting to Europeans in 1841. During the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, effective use was made of Zouaves and Chasseurs √† pied (see above) in evolving light infantry tactics that went further than merely screening the main battle line. At the Battle of Solferino these newly organized skirmishers operated as independent groups that were able to disrupt their Austrian opponents by sudden flank assaults. * Tirailleurs: Tirailleurs (Skirmishers) were light infantry who formed a shallow line ahead of the line of battle during the Revolutionary/Napoleonic Wars and subsequently. The name was also used for the locally recruited colonial troops in the French Empire between 1841 and 1962. =20th century= * Chasseurs √† pied: The Chasseurs √† pieds evolved during the mid 20th century into mechanized infantry units (Chasseurs m√©canis√©s) or armored division infantry (Chasseurs port√©s). After World War Two, all Chasseur units were organized on the mechanized infantry model. * Chasseurs alpins: The Chasseurs alpins, mountain warfare units of the French Army created in 1888. * Chasseurs pyr√©n√©ens and Chasseurs pyr√©n√©ens were the short-lived (1939‚Äì1940) mountain warfare units formed in the Pyr√©n√©es. * Chasseurs-Parachutistes: The Chasseurs-parachutistes were airborne infantry units formed in 1943 from Air Force infantry compagnies transferred to the Army. * Zouaves and Tirailleurs: After the independence of the countries that made up the French Colonial Empire, the Zouaves and the Tirailleurs units, save for one, were disbanded. =Modern French Army Light Infantry= * 7th Chasseurs Alpins Battalion * 13th Chasseurs Alpins Battalion * 16th Chasseur Battalion * 27e bataillon de chasseurs alpins * 1st Tirailleur Regiment * 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment Although the traditions of these different branches of the French Army are very different, there is still a tendency to confuse one with the other. For example, when World War I veteran L√©on Weil died, the AFP press agency stated that he was a member of the 5th \\"Regiment de Chasseurs Alpins\\". It was in fact the 5th Bataillon. Germany India The Indian Army of 1914 included ten regiments with \\"Light Infantry\\" in their titles. These were the: *2nd Queen Victoria's Own Rajput Light Infantry *5th Light Infantry *6th Jat Light Infantry *63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry *83rd Wallajahabad Light Infantry *91st Punjabis (Light Infantry) *103rd Mahratta Light Infantry *105th Mahratta Light Infantry *110th Mahratta Light Infantry *127th Baluch Light Infantry Most of these regiments lost their separate identity as a result of extensive amalgamations in 1922. The modern Indian Army retains the Maratha Light Infantry and the Sikh Light Infantry. Of the 28 infantry regiments of the modern Indian Army, the following ten are designated as \\"Rifles\\". They are distinguished by their black rank badges, black buttons on their service and ceremonial uniforms and a beret in a darker shade of green than other regiments. Two paramilitary forces‚Äîthe Assam Rifles and the Eastern Frontier Rifles‚Äîalso follow the traditions of a rifle regiment. *Rajputana Rifles *Garhwal Rifles *1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) *3 Gorkha Rifles *4 Gorkha Rifles *5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) *8 Gorkha Rifles *9 Gorkha Rifles *11 Gorkha Rifles *Jammu and Kashmir Rifles *Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry *Maratha Light Infantry *Sikh Light Infantry  Ireland  The Irish famously employed \\"Cethernacht\\" or Kern as light infantry. These usually made up the bulk of Gaelic and even later Anglo Norman Irish armies during the Middle Ages to renaissance era's. Traditionally armed with javelins and swords while wearing no armour, in later periods they were equipped with caliver muskets while still using little to no armour. They were notably effective while employed in tandem with heavily armed \\"Galloglaich\\" or anglicised Gallowglass. They could provide effective support to heavily armed troops as well as endlessly harassing enemies in difficult terrain. Today, all infantry battalions of the Irish Army are light infantry soldiers. Italy Most of the states of the Italian peninsula had their own units of skirmishers before Italian unification. One of the few that survived it were the Sardinian Bersaglieri, who were formed in 1836. They became some of the most iconic soldiers in Italian Army and were its \\"quick reaction force\\". The Alpini are the Italian Army's elite mountain troops, founded in 1875. Although they may not seem a true \\"light infantry\\" unit, (they were assigned their own artillery, carried double load of everything, and had a slower marching pace of 45 steps per minute), the Alpini were trained as jagers and skirmishers, introducing the use of skis and climbing training for all of their recruits. Those two corps still exist today, but in the years the Bersaglieri, have become a mechanised infantry unit, working closely with armoured units, and up until the mid-1990s had their own tank and artillery units. Other units that can be classified as light infantry are: * The Folgore Parachute Brigade, created in 1963, is the only airborne unit in the Italian Army. Apart from one light cavalry regiment, it comprises three airborne infantry and two special force regiments. * The Friuli Air Assault Brigade was originally an Italian Army mechanised brigade. In 2000 it converted to a fully airmobile role and is part of the \\"Friuli\\" Division. It is composed of three light aviation regiments and one infantry regiment‚Äî66th Reggimento Fanteria Aeromobile \\"Trieste\\"‚Äîthe only regiment in the Italian Army to be fully airmobile. * The San Marco Marine Brigade of the Italian Navy comprises three regiments. The First is an amphibious assault unit, the Second carries out force protection, boarding and search and seizure procedures on ships and the Third is a training unit. Given that it has almost only light vehicles (the heaviest being the amphibious Arisgator and AAV7 landing vehicles) and is tasked to operate in harsh terrain (shore lines, lagoons, deserts, mountains, jungles), it is one of the purest \\"light infantry\\" units in the Italian Armed Forces. * The 13th and 7th regiments of the Carabinieri were created during WW2 as highly mobile infantry. They are still deployed to war zones as light infantry and military law enforcement units. The Carabinieri also have some domestic law enforcement units trained as light or airmobile infantry. The Squadrone Eliportato \\"Cacciatori di Calabria (nicknamed the Falchi d'Aspromonte, meaning \\"Hawks of the Aspromonte\\") is tasked with opposing the \\"Camorra\\" criminal organisation, who are numerous and typically armed with military-grade weapons acquired on the black market, and operate deep within the mountainous region of the Aspromonte. The Squadrone Eliportato Cacciatori di Sardegna was created by the Carabinieri to reduce the spree of banditism (mainly kidnapping) that afflicts the innermost areas of Sardinia. Netherlands * Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers, guards regiment, an amalgamation of the Garderegiment Grenadiers and the Garderegiment Jagers. Consists of one air mobile infantry battalion * Regiment Limburgse Jagers, line infantry (former 2nd Infantry Regiment). Consists of one armoured infantry battalion Norway *H√¶rens Jegerkommando, the armed forces competence center for ranger, airborne and counter-terrorist duty in the Norwegian Army *Jegerkompaniet, the Norwegian Army's northernmost unit *Marinejegerkommandoen, a maritime special forces unit *Kystjegerkommandoen, coastal units *Grensejeger, border rangers at the border between Russia and Norway Poland *Wojska Obrony Terytorialnej, Territorial Defence Force 17 light infantry brigades Portugal Portuguese Riflemen were known as Ca√ßadores literally \\"Huntsmen\\". Portuguese Ca√ßadores battalions were the elite light soldiers of the Portuguese Army during the Peninsular War. They wore distinctive brown uniforms for camouflage. They were considered, by the Duke of Wellington, as the \\"fighting cocks of his army\\". Each Ca√ßadores battalion included an elite company armed with rifles known as atiradores (literally \\"Shooters\\"). In the first half of the 20th century the Ca√ßadores battalions were recreated as border defense units. In the 1950s, the title \\"Ca√ßadores\\" was also given to the light infantry battalions and independent companies responsible for garrisoning overseas territories. Colonial troops with this title were recruited from both Portuguese settlers and from indigenous populations. In the 1950s, the Portuguese Air Force formed a unit of paratroopers called Ca√ßadores Paraquedistas (\\"Parachutist Hunters\\"). Battalions of Ca√ßadores Paraquedistas were later created in Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea. At the beginning of the 1960s, several special forces companies of the Portuguese Army were named \\"Special Huntsmen\\" (Ca√ßadores Especiais). These units wore a brown beret in the colour of the uniforms of the ca√ßadores of the Peninsular War. These units were later abolished and the brown beret started to be used by most of the units of the Portuguese Army. In 1975, the designation \\"Ca√ßadores\\" was discontinued in the Portuguese Armed Forces. All former units of ca√ßadores were redesigned as \\"Infantry\\". Currently, every infantry soldier of the Portuguese Army is known as atirador. Rhodesia The Rhodesian Light Infantry was a regular regiment of the Rhodesian Army, unique in having the traditions of light infantry while serving as a modern Commando regiment. Romania *V√¢nƒÉtori de Munte, or \\"Mountain Huntsmen\\" comprised elite units of the Romanian infantry prior to 1945. Russia The Imperial Russian Army, which was heavily influenced by the Prussian and Austrian military systems, included fifty J√§ger or yegerskii [–µ–≥–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π] regiments in its organisation by 1812, including the Egersky Guards Regiment. They were mostly united with line infantry regiments in 1833, when almost all Russian infantry began to receive the same training; including skirmishing. At the same time strelkovyi [—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤—ã–π] battalions were introduced. These undertook light infantry functions when the skirmishing skills of line infantry were insufficient. Spain Historically the Spanish infantry included several battalions of light infantry that were designated as Cazadores. These units were incorporated into the ordinary infantry following army reorganization in the early 1930s. Until 2006 the modern Spanish Army maintained a Brigada de Cazadores de Monta√±a \\"Arag√≥n I\\" (Mountain Huntsmen Brigade \\"Arag√≥n I\\") Sweden *J√§gare, elite units in the Swedish Armed Forces *Fallsk√§rmsj√§garna, the Parachute Rangers *Swedish Parachute Ranger School *√ñ-Nerike skvadron, Intelligence squadron *Vadsbo skvadron, Airborne squadron *Army Ranger Battalion, Arctic warfare rifles *Kustj√§garna, Coastal Rangers Somalia *Danab, which translates to \\"Lightning\\" are the elite commandos units of the Somali Armed Forces.  United Kingdom  95th Rifles regiment. The British Army first experimented with light infantry in the French and Indian War, to counter the tactics used by the French-allied Native Americans. Along with secondment of regular infantry, several specialised units were raised (including Rogers' Rangers and the 80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot), though most if not all had been disbanded by the middle of the 1760s. From 1770, all regular battalions were required to designate one of their ten companies a \\"Light Company\\", though their training in skirmishing was poor and inconsistent. Dedicated rifle and light infantry regiments began to be formed or converted in the Napoleonic Wars, to counter the French Chasseurs. A new battalion of the 60th Royal Americans (later the King's Royal Rifle Corps) was raised in 1797, and an \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\" (later the 95th Rifles and then the Rifle Brigade) in 1800. Both were equipped with green jackets and Baker rifles. Some extant regiments began to be designated \\"Light Infantry\\" at this point, receiving skirmishing training but generally still equipped with red coats and muskets. In the Peninsular War, a Light Brigade and later a Light Division were formed, at some points incorporating Portuguese Ca√ßadores. By the Crimean War, rifles had become universal and tactics had substantially changed. This meant that the distinctions between light and line infantry were effectively limited to details such as name, a rapid march of 140 steps per minute, buglers instead of drummers and fifers, a parade drill which involved carrying rifles parallel to the ground (\\"at the trail\\") and dark green cloth helmets instead of dark blue. Light infantry badges always incorporated bugle horns as a central feature. In the Second World War, the use of light infantry was revived in what became the British Commandos and the Parachute Regiment. Because of the nature of their role and deployment, they were more lightly equipped than most infantry battalions. The Parachute Regiment has survived to this day, while the Royal Marine Commandos are directly descended from those units formed in the Second World War. Most of the old light infantry and rifle regiments were administratively grouped in a new Light Division in 1968. The British Army ordered regimental amalgamations in 1957, 1966, 1990 and 2003. The Rifles (the largest infantry regiment in the British Army) was formed in 2007 from the amalgamation of the regiments of the Light Division. The Rifles maintain the traditional quick parade march of all British light infantry, the Rifle Brigade's \\"rifle green\\" No 1 dress with blackened buttons and black leather belts, and many other traditions and \\"golden threads\\" of its parent regiments. Rifle and light infantry regiments that did not become part of the Rifles included the Royal Ulster Rifles, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and the Highland Light Infantry. Today, \\"Light role infantry\\" is a designation that can be applied to an infantry battalion of any regiment. Light role infantry are not (by default) equipped with armoured vehicles (unlike Armoured Infantry or Mechanised Infantry). United States In 1808, the United States Army created its first Regiment of Riflemen. During the War of 1812 three more Rifle Regiments were raised but disbanded after the war. The Rifle Regiment was disbanded in 1821. In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Colonel Jefferson Davis created and led the Mississippi Rifles. Riflemen were listed as separate to infantry up to the American Civil War.United States War Department Revised Regulations for the Army of the United States, 1861: With a Full Index J. G. L. Brown, printer, 1861 During the Civil War, Sharpshooter regiments were raised in the North with several companies being raised by individual states for their own regiments.

Youth and playing career Doyle was born in Castleisland, County Kerry, and began playing rugby union at Newbridge College, County Kildare. He went on to study veterinary science at University College Dublin, who he also represented at rugby. He made his Ireland debut against France on 23 January 1965, scoring a try in the game. While representing Ireland he also studied at Cambridge University where he gained a Blue in the 1965 Varsity match against the Oxford University RFC. Doyle also studied at the University of Edinburgh and played club rugby for Edinburgh Wanderers before returning to Ireland. He went on to earn the distinction of never being dropped during his 20-cap international career as a flanker. Doyler, as he was affectionately known, scored the winning try against Wales in 1967, toured Australia with Ireland in 1967 and South Africa with the British and Irish Lions the next year. His last game for Ireland was against Australia in October 1968, when he lined out alongside his brother Tommy. Coaching He coached Leinster to Interprovincial Championship success five times between 1979 and 1983 before he succeeded Willie John McBride as Ireland coach during the 1984‚Äì85 season. Under Doyle's stewardship, Ireland, in 1985 won the Triple Crown and Five Nations Championship. He led Ireland to the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, but that joy was tinged with sadness as he suffered a heart attack at the opening dinner. He battled illness and adversity and his recovery from a brain problem was chronicled in his book '0.16'. Media After retiring from coaching, Doyle became a TV expert on RT√â television, starting with the 1991 World Cup, and continuing both on live coverage and their \\"Rugby After Dark\\" Sunday night highlights programme until having to step down through ill-health in the late-90s.

He became a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, after serving as delegate to the First Continental Congress from Pennsylvania. For much of his career in Pennsylvania politics, he was a close ally of Benjamin Franklin, and he became a leading figure in the colony. As a delegate to the Continental Congress, Galloway was a moderate and proposed a Plan of Union which would have averted a full break from Britain. When that was rejected, he moved increasingly towards Loyalism. After 1778, Galloway lived in Britain where he acted as a leader of the Loyalist movement and an advisor to the government. Many Loyalists went into exile after America won its independence from Britain and signed the Peace of Paris (1783) and so Galloway permanently settled in Britain. Early life Galloway was born near West River, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, the son of a landowner in the Colony. He moved with his father to Pennsylvania in 1749 where he received a liberal schooling. He studied law, for a time alongside William Franklin the son of Benjamin Franklin and later a fellow Loyalist,Middlekauff p.87 and he was admitted to the bar and began to practice law in Philadelphia. Galloway married Grace Growdon on October 18, 1753, at Philadelphia. Some scholars speculate that he married her out of motives of financial ascension, due to her wealthy father, rather than for reasons of affection. Galloway converted to Anglicanism from Quakerism in order to marry Grace, and the conversion enhanced his political career. Political career Galloway was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from 1756 to 1774 and served as Speaker of the House from 1766 to 1774. He was a prominent member of the faction which opposed Pennsylvania being a Proprietary Colony of the Penn family, and he called for it to be turned into a Crown Colony. Both Galloway and Franklin devoted a great deal of effort in lobbying London to bring the colony directly under the Crown's control. He was a British-American nationalist, believing that most Americans would prefer to remain loyal to the Crown if only they were given a legitimate and effective government that would inspire their loyalty. Galloway was a member of the Continental Congress in 1774, where he proposed a compromise plan for Union with Great Britain which would provide the colonies with their own parliament subject to the Crown. The Continental Congress rejected it by one vote. He signed the nonimportation agreement, while he was opposed to independence for the Thirteen colonies and remained loyal to the King. He was a resident of Philadelphia and an associate of Benjamin Franklin with whom he corresponded over the issues of American independence. In 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society, which Franklin founded, and served as Vice-President of the organization from 1769-1776.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, 3:114‚Äì117. Galloway urged reform of the imperial administration and was critical of the trade laws, the Stamp Act of 1765, and the Townshend Acts enacted in 1767, and he had a conciliatory plan to end the disputes between Britain and the colonies. He believed that the British had the right to tax and govern the colonies, keep the peace, and help the colonies to survive and flourish. Congress voted to expunge Galloway's plan from their journal, so he published it himself in 1775, reprimanding Congress for ignoring his analysis of Parliament's powers and colonial rights. He proposed a written constitution and joint legislature for the whole British Empire. American War of Independence In 1775, the Assembly rejected Galloway's urging that it abandon its struggle for independence from Britain, so Galloway left the Assembly and the Congress. In the winter of 1777, he joined British General Howe and accompanied him on his Philadelphia campaign. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, he was appointed Superintendent of Police and headed the civil government. He aggressively organized the Loyalists in the city, but the British army was driven out of the city in 1778 following France's entry into the war. The British army retreated to New York, and he went with them. Exile in Britain In 1778, he fled to Britain with his daughter, never to return to the United States, and he became a leading spokesman of American Loyalists in London. The General Assembly of Pennsylvania convicted him of high treason and confiscated his estates, which included Trevose Manor, now known as Growdon Mansion, and much of the land that is now Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania. In 1779, he appeared as a government witness in a parliamentary enquiry into the conduct of Lord Howe and General Howe during the Philadelphia Campaign, of which he was deeply critical.Syrett pp. 97‚Äì99 When Galloway fled Philadelphia with the British, his wife Grace remained in the city with the hope of retaining the rights of their property. They expected that she would be able to join her daughter and husband afterwards, but Charles Willson Peale evicted her.Linda K. Kerber, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980), p. 75 Galloway was influential in convincing the British that a vast reservoir of Loyalist support could be tapped by aggressive leadership, thus setting up the British invasion of the South. After the war, he spent his remaining years in religious studies and writing. He died a widower in Watford, Hertfordshire on August 10, 1803; his wife had died on February 6, 1782.

The ANL operated on the East Coast of the United States in 1929.  History  The Eastern Colored League (ECL) had been the eastern of two major Negro leagues from 1923 through 1927 until its collapse during the 1928 season. Next winter the American Negro League was established by five former ECL teams-- the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, the Baltimore Black Sox, the traveling Cuban Stars, the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, and the Lincoln Giants of New York City--along with the Homestead Grays, an important independent club.  1929 season  :Annual final standings: 1929 The ANL operated a split season: first half and second-half schedules with a planned playoff for a pennant in a post-season series between the two winners. The Baltimore Black Sox, led by player-manager Dick Lundy and Hall of Fame first baseman Jud Wilson, won both halves and they were awarded the pennant without a playoff.  Demise  The league did not organize for the 1930 season, and it would not be until 1933 that an eastern Negro league would last for a full season. Beside the downward economic spiral, bitter controversy in Baltimore and Philadelphia, about the local clubs continuing reliance on white umpires, may have been fatal to the league.Lanctot, 198-201.  Statistics  The ANL made a conscientious effort, unusual for the Negro leagues, to compile statistics for the league's players. These were published at season's end in the Pittsburgh Courier.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 17,346. History It was first chronicled in 1234 as Grad Mersky (lit. the town of the Merya). It gradually developed into one of the greatest salt-mining centers of Eastern Europe, eclipsing the southern town of Halych, from which it takes its name. In the 13th century, Galich was ruled by a younger brother of Alexander Nevsky and remained in his line until 1363, when the Muscovites seized the principality and ousted the ruling family to Novgorod. The 15th and 16th centuries are justly considered the golden age of Galich. At that time it controlled most of the Russian trade in salt and furs. Dmitry Shemyaka and other local princes pressed their claims to the Muscovite crown, and three of them actually took possession of the Kremlin in the course of the Great Feudal War. The early medieval earthen ramparts were further fortified in the early 15th and 16th centuries and have since been known as Shemyaka Hills. The Poles burnt it to the ground in 1612, Peter the Great had a wooden kremlin demolished, and it further declined with the transfer of Russian foreign trade from Arkhangelsk to St. Petersburg. Town status was granted to Galich in 1778. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Galich serves as the administrative center of Galichsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Resolution #133-a As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Galich‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #112-4-ZKO As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Galich is incorporated as Galich Urban Okrug.Law #237-ZKO Economy Galich-made Galichanin cranes can be encountered as far away as in Medeo, Kazakhstan The Galich Mobile Crane Plant () manufactures some 20% of Russia's entire mobile crane production. Town's industries also manufacture steel barrels, shoes, and clothing. There is a timber mill in town as well. The town is also a minor railroad node of the Trans-Siberian Railway. A tall guyed mast for FM and TV broadcasting can be seen in the town. Culture The churches of Paisiev Monastery date from the 16th and 17th centuries Historic monuments of Galich include various buildings from the imperial period of Russian history. Particularly noteworthy is the Paisiev Monastery, founded in the early 14th century and featuring a 16th-century five-domed cathedral and a three-domed church from 1642. Since 2004, Galich hosts the annual short film festival \\"Russia's Family\\" (, Semya Rossii), whose stated goals are \\"to aid spiritual and moral healing of Russian society and to promote traditional family values\\".

Life and career Hartert was born in Hamburg, Germany. In July 1891, he married the illustrator Claudia Bernadine Elisabeth Hartert in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, with whom he had a son named son Joachim Karl (Charles) Hartert, (1893‚Äì1916), who was killed as an English soldier on the Somme. Together with his wife, he was the first to describe the blue-tailed Buffon hummingbird subspecies (Chalybura buffonii intermedia Hartert, E & Hartert, C, 1894). The article On a collection of Humming Birds from Ecuador and Mexico appears to be their only joint publication. Hartert was employed by Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild as ornithological curator of Rothshild's private Natural History Museum at Tring, in England from 1892 to 1929. Hartert published the quarterly museum periodical Novitates Zoologicae (1894‚Äì39) with Rothschild, and the Hand-List of British Birds (1912) with Francis Charles Robert Jourdain, Norman Frederick Ticehurst and Harry Forbes Witherby. He wrote Die V√∂gel der pal√§arktischen Fauna (1910‚Äì22) and travelled in India, Africa, and South America on behalf of his employer. In 1930, Hartert retired to Berlin, where he died in 1933.

This practice is sometimes called tabletop guitar, because many prepared guitarists do not hold the instrument in the usual manner, but instead place the guitar on a table to manipulate it. The idea of altering an instrument's timbre through the use of external objects has been applied to other instruments as well, most notably John Cage's prepared piano, which preceded the prepared guitar. History With prepared guitars, however, one of the key goals in preparing the instrument is changing its timbre ‚Äì the fundamental tone composition of the sound. This is typically achieved by placing objects on or under the strings. The objects can have a tone of their own, like for instance a pen spring, but can also cause strange string resonance effects or behave like a seesaw and create echoing or buzzing effects after being struck and swinging like a balance. Many of the sounds sound more or less like clocks, bells or Non Western musical instruments or even non string percussion instruments. Bj√∏rn Fongaard The history of Norwegian composer and guitar player Bj√∏rn Fongaard (1919‚Äì1980) probably marks the first steps into prepared guitar. He started off by constructing a quarter tone guitar with adaption of the fretboard, but very early left this in favour of a diverse set of prepared guitar techniques. His first pieces in this genre came in the mid 1960s. Keith Rowe The method of actually preparing the guitar was developed in the late 1960s by Keith Rowe, in imitation of Jackson Pollock's painting method and John Cage's prepared piano. Rowe developed various prepared guitar techniques: placing the guitar flat on a table and manipulating the strings, body and pickups in unorthodox ways to produce sounds described as dark, brooding, compelling, expansive and alien. He has been known to employ objects such as a library card, rubber eraser, springs, hand-held electric fans, alligator clips, and common office supplies in playing the guitar. Fred Frith Another pioneer was Fred Frith who in 1974 released a solo album called Guitar Solos. The album comprises eight tracks of unaccompanied and improvised music played on prepared guitars by Frith. The album was recorded using a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. Frith added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound from both sides of the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately, that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channeled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape. Other prepared guitarists In the 1980s Glenn Branca, Sonic Youth and other experimental art rockers also utilized prepared guitars. Koka Nikoladze developed a preparation technique, which afterwards was named \\"Nikoladze\\" Preparation. In this case an acoustic guitar was prepared with a certain type of a light bulb and produced synthetic - alike sound. The beautiful demonstration of upper mentioned technique is the composition \\"Starshine ~\\" for violin, prepared guitar and percussion. Other contemporary prepared guitar composers/performers include: * Dani Rabin of Marbin incorporated prepared guitar into the Jazz-Rock style in a non-avant-garde fashion. * Duane Denison had used prepared guitar with The Jesus Lizard and Legendary Shack Shakers. * GP Hall (active since the late '60s) who uses a variety of guitars played with implements including psaltery bows, palette knives, electric fans and razors, wind-up toys, velcro and crocodile clips (Some of Hall's techniques are similar to Keith Rowe's methods but are applied to a much more melodic compositional and improvisational style) * Steve Parry of Hwyl Nofio uses a prepared guitar technique and developed a bowed device based on the violin, utilizing paper clips, nails, a razor, pliers, bow, automata. * Koka Nikoladze Developed a guitar preparation technique with light bulb (2009), he also did a lot in developing a standard acoustic guitar as the bowed instrument. * Mart√≠n Irigoyen of Vernian Process and Erik Sanko, both of whom use electronic devices, hand ventilators, walkie-talkies, paper clips, aluminum foil, credit cards and tweezers. * Nikita Koshkin, who uses cork, matches and foam mutes. *Jacques Palinckx (active since the 1980s) from the Netherlands uses vibrators, radio, toys and knives. *Cor Fuhler uses multiple vibrators and 3rd bridge on acoustic guitar. * Micachu, who uses unorthodox instruments which are sometimes customised or even homemade. These included a modified guitar played with a hammer action, called a 'chu'. Other short scaled children guitar has an additional third bridge right next to the sound hole which shortens the scale length leading to an alternate microtonal division of the fret intervals. * These Are Powers, who use a bass guitar with a rod placed between the strings and the body to shorten the string length as well as playing behind that additional bridge like a tailed bridge guitar. * Michael Chorney, who plays prepared-guitar * Shane Parish of Ahleuchatistas, who places a wire in front of the bridge in some songs.Ahleuchatistas - Vanished *Paolo Angeli, who use a \\"Sardinian prepared guitar\\": an orchestra-instrument with 18 cords, a hybrid between guitar, cello and drums, gifted with hammers, pedals at variable speed. Custom made instruments A Home Swinger, 3rd bridge zither Beginning in the 1970s, guitarist and luthier Hans Reichel made some unusual guitars with third bridge-like qualities. Bradford Reed (pencilina), Glenn Branca, Fred Frith and the band Neptune also made other individually different types of experimental third bridge guitars. Yuri Landman derived a just intoned musical scale from an initially considered atonal prepared guitar playing technique based on adding a 3rd bridge under the strings. He constructed an instrument called the Moodswinger with this scale. When this bridge is positioned in the noded positions of the harmonic series the volume of the instrument increases and the overtone becomes clear and has a consonant relation to the complementary opposed string part creating a harmonic multiphonic tone.3rd Bridge Helix by Yuri Landman on furious.com Books about prepared guitar techniques Not much is published about the subject. The classical guitarists Elgart/Yates Duo have written a 24-page booklet Prepared Guitar Techniques on the subject for acoustic guitars. In 2012 Bart Hopkin and Yuri Landman wrote and published Nice Noise, a 72-page book about guitar preparations for acoustic as well as electric guitars. Besides guitar preparation techniques, the book also features several modified and custom built instruments made by Hopkin, Landman, Sonic Youth, Sam Dook of The Go!

Formally, the reference context-free grammar of the language is ambiguous, meaning there is more than one correct parse tree. In many programming languages one may write conditionally executed code in two forms: the if-then form, and the if-then-else form ‚Äì the else clause is optional: if a then s if b then s1 else s2 This gives rise to an ambiguity in interpretation when there are nested statements, specifically whenever an if- then form appears as \`s1\` in an if-then-else form: if a then if b then s else s2 In this example, \`s\` is unambiguously executed when \`a\` is true and \`b\` is true, but one may interpret \`s2\` as being executed when \`a\` is false (thus attaching the else to the first if) or when \`a\` is true and \`b\` is false (thus attaching the else to the second if). In other words, one may see the previous statement as either of the following expressions: if a then (if b then s) else s2 if a then (if b then s else s2) The dangling else problem dates to ALGOL 60, and has been resolved in various ways in subsequent languages. In LR parsers, the dangling else is the archetypal example of a shift-reduce conflict. Avoiding ambiguity while keeping the syntax This is a problem that often comes up in compiler construction, especially scannerless parsing. The convention when dealing with the dangling else is to attach the else to the nearby if statement,5.2 Shift/Reduce Conflicts from GNU Operating System web site allowing for unambiguous context-free grammars, in particular. Programming languages like PascalISO 7185:1990 (Pascal) 6.8.3.4: An if- statement without an else-part shall not be immediately followed by the token else., CISO 9899:1999 (C): 6.8.4.1(3): \\"An else is associated with the lexically nearest preceding if that is allowed by the syntax.\\", available at WG14 N1256, p. 134 and Java follow this convention, so there is no ambiguity in the semantics of the language, though the use of a parser generator may lead to ambiguous grammars. In these cases alternative grouping is accomplished by explicit blocks, such as \`begin...end\` in PascalPascal, Nell Dale and Chip Weems, \\"Dangling Else\\", p. 160‚Äì161 and \`{...}\` in C. Depending on the compiler construction approach, one may take different corrective actions to avoid ambiguity: *If the parser is produced by an SLR, LR(1) or LALR LR parser generator, the programmer will often rely on the generated parser feature of preferring shift over reduce whenever there is a conflict. Alternatively, the grammar can be rewritten to remove the conflict, at the expense of an increase in grammar size (see below). *If the parser is hand written, the programmer may use a non-ambiguous context-free grammar. Alternatively, one may rely on a non-context-free grammar or a parsing expression grammar. Avoiding ambiguity by changing the syntax The problem can also be solved by making explicit the link between an else and its if, within the syntax. This usually helps avoid human errors.Ambiguity of dangling else: non-context-free grammars are semantically opaque Possible solutions are: *Having an \\"end if\\" statement. Examples of such languages are ALGOL 68, Ada, Eiffel, PL/SQL and Visual Basic *Disallowing the statement following a \\"then\\" to be an \\"if\\" itself (it may however be a pair of statement brackets containing only an if-then-clause). This approach is followed by ALGOL 60.4.5.1 Conditional Statements ‚Äî Syntax in P. Nauer (ed.), Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60, CACM 6,1, 1963 pp. 1-17 *Requiring braces (parenthesize) when an \\"else\\" follows an \\"if\\".Ambiguity of dangling else: require braces when else follows if This is effectively true in Python as its indentation rules delimit every block, not just those in \\"if\\" statements. *Requiring every \\"if\\" to be paired with an \\"else\\". To avoid a similar problem concerning semantics rather than syntax, Racket deviates from Scheme by considering an \`if\` without a fallback clause to be an error, effectively distinguishing conditional expressions (i.e \`if\`) from conditional statements (i.e \`when\` and \`unless\`, which do not have fallback clauses). *Using different keywords for the one-alternative and two-alternative \\"if\\" statements. S-algol uses \`if e do s\` for the one-alternative case and \`if e1 then e2 else e3\` for the general case. * Require braces unconditionally, like Swift and Modula-2. To reduce the resulting clutter, Modula-2 does away with the block opener on non function levels. Examples Concrete examples follow. C In C, the grammar reads, in part: statement = ...  selection-statement selection-statement = ...  IF ( expression ) statement  IF ( expression ) statement ELSE statement Thus, without further rules, the statement if (a) if (b) s; else s2; could ambiguously be parsed as if it were either: if (a) { if (b) s; else s2; } or: if (a) { if (b) s; } else s2; In practice in C the first tree is chosen, by associating the \`else\` with the nearest \`if\`. Avoiding the conflict in LR parsers The above example could be rewritten in the following way to remove the ambiguity : statement: open_statement  closed_statement ; open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' statement  IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement ; closed_statement: non_if_statement  IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement ; non_if_statement: ... ; Any other statement-related grammar rules may also have to be duplicated in this way if they may directly or indirectly end with a \`statement\` or \`selection-statement\` non-terminal. However, we give grammar that includes both of if and while statements. statement: open_statement  closed_statement ; open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' statement  IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement  WHILE '(' expression ')' open_statement ; closed_statement: simple_statement  IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement  WHILE '(' expression ')' closed_statement ; simple_statement: ... ; Finally, we give the grammar that forbids ambiguous IF statements. statement: open_statement  closed_statement ; open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' simple_statement  IF '(' expression ')' open_statement  IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement  WHILE '(' expression ')' open_statement ; closed_statement: simple_statement  IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement  WHILE '(' expression ')' closed_statement ; simple_statement: ... ; With this grammar parsing of \\"if (a) if (b) c else d\\" fails: statement open_statement IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement 'if' '(' 'a' ')' closed_statement 'else' 'd' and then the parsing fails trying to match \`closed_statement\` to \\"if (b) c\\". An attempt with \`closed_statement\` fails in the same way.

Life He was born at Yester House near Gifford, East Lothian, the son of General Sir George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale and his wife, Lady Susan Montague. He was sent to university in both Leipzig and Geneva. Training in the military he received a commission in the British Army in 1841. He rose to be a Colonel in the Grenadier Guards. He served as a soldier in India and the Crimea. He succeeded his father in the marquessate in 1876. He died at Chislehurst, and was succeeded by his brother. Hay purchased a lieutenancy in the Grenadier Guards in 1841. He purchased a captaincy in 1846 and was promoted lieutenant-colonel without purchase in 1854 and Colonel in 1860. In 1866 he transferred to the 17th Lancers. He was president of the Zoological Society of London from 16 January 1868. He had a private collection of birds, insects, reptiles and mammals and employed Carl Bock to travel to Maritime Southeast Asia and collect specimens. Tweeddale described about 40 species collected by Bock for the first time and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871. His ornithological works were published privately in 1881 by his nephew, Captain Robert George Wardlaw-Ramsay, with a memoir by Dr W. H. Russell, and the attribution Walden is used in taxonomic listings.Ramsay, R G (1881) The ornithological works of Arthur, ninth Marquis of Tweeddale scanned He died at Walden Cottage in Chislehurst, London on 28 December 1878.

The oldest form of caulk consisted of fibrous materials driven into the wedge-shaped seams between boards on wooden boats or ships. Cast iron sewerage pipe were formerly caulked in a similar way. Riveted seams in ships and boilers were formerly sealed by hammering the metal.Walter S. Hutton, Steam-boiler Construction, 1898, p. 230 Modern caulking compounds are flexible sealing compounds used to close up gaps in buildings and other structures against water, air, dust, insects, or as a component in firestopping. In the tunnelling industry, caulking is the sealing of joints in segmental precast concrete tunnels, commonly by using concrete. Historical uses Wooden shipbuilding Traditional caulking (also spelled calking) on wooden vessels uses fibers of cotton and oakum (hemp fiber soaked in pine tar). These fibers are driven into the wedge-shaped seam between planks, with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a caulking iron. The caulking is then covered over with a putty, in the case of hull seams, or else in deck seams with melted pine pitch, in a process referred to as paying, or \\"calefaction\\". Those who carried out this work were known as caulkers. In the Hebrew Bible, the prophet Ezekiel refers to the caulking of ships as a specialist skill. Modern marine sealants are frequently used now in place of the pitch, or even to supplant the oakum and cotton itself. File:Caulked hull timbers, Spry, Blists Hill.jpgDried-out caulking on the Severn trow Spry, now displayed on shore File:Caulking tools.jpgThe tools of traditional wooden ship caulking: caulking mallet, caulker's seat, caulking irons, cotton and oakum File:MaryRose-caulking tools2.JPGA caulking mallet, tar pot and a piece of petrified tar found on board the 16th century carrack Mary Rose Iron or steel shipbuilding In riveted steel or iron ship construction, caulking was a process of rendering seams watertight by driving a thick, blunt chisel-like tool into the plating adjacent to the seam. This had the effect of displacing the metal into a close fit with the adjoining piece. Originally done by hand much like wooden vessel caulking, pneumatic tools were later employed. With the advent of electric-arc welding for ship construction, steel ship caulking was rendered obsolete. Boilermaking Caulking of iron and steel, of the same type described above for ship's hulls, was also used by boilermakers in the era of riveted boilers to make the joints watertight and steamtight. Modern use in construction Silicone-based caulk on this upturned bathroom sink will spread smoothly, sealing the gap, when the sink is turned over and installed. To caulk in the building trades is to close up joints and gaps in buildings. Caulking provides thermal insulation, controls water penetration and reduces noise transmission. This is mostly done with ready-mixed construction chemicals sold as caulk such as silicone, polyurethane, polysulfide, silyl- terminated-polyether or polyurethane and acrylic sealant. Application Silicone caulking extruded from a caulking gun For bulk use, caulk is generally distributed in disposable cartridges, which are rigid cylindrical cardboard or plastic tubes with an applicator tip at one end, and a movable plunger at the far end. These are used in caulking guns, which typically have a trigger connected to a rod which pushes the plunger, and has a ratchet to prevent backlash. The push rod may also be actuated by a motor or by compressed air. Similar mechanisms are used for grease guns. For smaller applications, caulk may be distributed in squeezable tubes. Backer rod Backer rod, also called backer material or back-up rod, is a flexible foam product used behind caulking to increase elasticity, reduce consumption, force the caulking into contact with the sides of the joint creating a better bond, determine the thickness of the caulking, and define the cross-section hour- glass shape of the caulk. The backer rod also acts as a bond breaker to keep the caulking from sticking to the bottom of the opening‚Äîcalled a three-sided bond‚Äîwith the caulk only adhering to the sides of the opening in an hour-glass shape it can flex more easily and is less likely to tear. Backer rods can also be used to reduce consumption of the caulking by filling part of the joints. Backer rod is often round and rope-like in shape but many special types and shaped such as square, rectangular and D-shapes are available. High temperature backer rods are available. It is available in different diameters and firmness, and in polyethylene and polyurethane materials. Backer rod also comes in open-cell and closed-cell types of foam. Open-cell foam is porous so it will let gasses through which could otherwise cause blistering of the sealant. Also, open-cell backer rod allows air to get to the back side of the sealant which accelerates curing when used with air-cured sealants such as silicone. Open-cell rod is more compressible than closed-cell foam and should be 25% larger diameter than the joint. Closed-cell foam does not absorb water and is impermeable. Closed-cell rods are less compressible and should not be compressed more than 25%. Closed-cell rod will also lose firmness and out-gas if damaged during installation or overcompressed or at sharp bends. The gasses cannot pass through this backer rod and can deform, weaken, and even cause holes (leaks) in the sealant as it escapes. Out-gassing is the reason open- cell backer rod was developed. Energy efficiency According to the Consumer Federation of America, sealing unwanted leaks around homes is an excellent way to cut home energy costs and decrease the household carbon footprint. Also, sealing cracks and crevices around homes lessens the strain on home appliances and can save time, money and hassle by preventing major repairs. Additionally, increasing the lifetime of homes and appliances also puts less waste and pollution into landfills. Preventing infestation Sealing cracks and crevices prevents ingress by rodents. Types Acrylic Latex The most common type of caulk is acrylic latex for general purpose use. Acrylic Tile Sealant The Acrylic tile sealant usually comes in small tubes and is commonly used for wet applications. Josh Shankowsky, \\"Exterior Maintenance Plan: Why Routine Caulking is Needed on Commercial Buildings\\", Epic Rope Access, October 2 2019 Vinyl Latex On average lasts longer than the more common acrylic latex caulking. Silicone Mold and mildew resistant type of sealant. Polyurethane Very durable and professional grade. Difficult to shape/tool. High VOC content.

It airs primarily in Germany and the surrounding German-speaking countries. The show has been running on Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) since 1973, premi√®ring on 8 January in that year. Sesamstra√üe is also shown on the children's channel, KiKa. History The Dubbed Era: 1973-onwards After a short test run of a few original, undubbed Sesame Street episodes from August 1972 onward, the German version of the show premiered on 8 January 1973. The first three seasons, or 250, episodes of Sesamstra√üe consisted of the original American episodes dubbed into German in Hamburg. Only the opening and closing songs and sequences were changed, with new lyrics written by Volker Ludwig and tunes by Ingfried Hoffmann. The title of the German theme song is Der, die, das (wer, wie, was ‚Äì wieso, weshalb, warum ‚Äì wer nicht fragt, bleibt dumm!), almost literally translating to \\"this, this and that (who, how, what ‚Äì why, why and why ‚Äì those who don't ask stay dumb!)\\". In Bavaria, Bayerischer Rundfunk felt that the Sesame Street set was too gritty to suit German children, and consequently developed its own children's programme called Das feuerrote Spielmobil (The fire-red Play- mobile). Variety shows like Peter Alexander pr√§sentiert Spezialit√§ten in 1975 promoted the show by visiting the original United States set and taping special footage. From 1976 through 1977, the street scenes were dropped, partly as the resultof a constant onslaught by protesting parents who were unhappy with the \\"controversial\\" character of Oscar the Grouch. Instead, a new framing story was created, following the antics of a boy named Bumfidel and his mother. Since these stories did not take place on a street, the show's title was temporarily rendered incomprehensible. The most controversial moment of this early period was a film showing the unconcealed birth of a human baby. The Co-production Era: 1977-onwards In 1977, a German street set was built at Studio Hamburg for German framing stories. Samson, a bear (1978‚Äì2009, and since 2013) and Tiffy the bird (1978‚Äì2005) replaced Big Bird (Bibo) and Oscar the Grouch (Oskar der Griesgram) as main characters, and the new version debuted on January 2, 1978. The early puppets were built by Kermit Love; nowadays, Sesame Workshop builds the puppets for Sesamstra√üe. Each episode featured the new puppets interacting with a pair of human characters; consistently one male, one female. The individual sketches of Sesame Street's original American inhabitants remained the dubbed main part of the show, but some were edited to omit intros that displayed words in English (such as The Adventures of Super Grover or the Sesame Street News Flash skits). In the following years more characters were added to the German street scenes, such as the German-built, androgynous Uli von B√∂defeld (Uli is short for Ulrich), also called Herr von B√∂defeld (1978‚Äì1988), and Finchen, a snail (1983, 1989‚Äìpresent). Just as in its American counterpart, the German characters have been remodeled over the decades. Most obvious were changes in Samson and Tiffy; Finchen has also had his fair share of fabric surgery. During this era, the fact that the street stories took place in a studio was never kept a secret. Some parts of the street were simply 'matted in' during an episode, or the characters would ask for help from the studio crew; one episode about Samson trying to scratch a flea ends with the entire studio crew itching. The matting also allowed the characters to show up in different locations, like a beach, a small deserted island that would be surrounded by an entire ocean through the snap of one's fingers, a nearby train station, or the roof of the studio. While Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, both performed by Caroll Spinney, had visited Sesamstra√üe for the 10th Anniversary special before, a highlight of this era was the celebration of Sesamstra√üe's 1000th episode; the \\"Sesamelly Zirkusshow,\\" a circus gala performance taped at \\"Zirkus Althoff\\" in which Big Bird appeared alongside the German characters one more time. In 1985 and 1986, no new episodes were taped; instead, a wild mix of repeats was shown on TV. From 1986, onward new episodes with two new human actors were produced, and while the studio set remained largely the same, a bicycle shop was added, run by the new residents. Tiffy and Samson were slightly remodeled for the first time for these episodes. In 1988, the studio set and original puppets were destroyed in a fire. The puppets were rebuilt in 1989 with significant changes. The new set was centered around the new bicycle shop that was introduced in 1986, but the street stories no longer took place in a studio set. Instead, a courtyard was added, and new characters were introduced: Rumpel the Grouch (1989‚Äì2009), living inside a water barrel, and Buh (1989‚Äì2002), an owl housed inside a hollow tree. While the set offered Tiffy a new apartment-like living room in the coming years, it still featured Samson's cave in which he had lived in prior to the set change. Uli von B√∂defield was removed from the show due to the creators of Sesamstra√üe not wishing to pay licensing fees. Later in the 1990s, the courtyard slowly transitioned into an entire marketplace, a common social center for German towns and even city districts. Leonie L√∂wenherz (Leonie Lionheart in English), a female lion (1989-early 1990s), was featured for a very short time after the set and puppets were destroyed in the fire. Just like Uli von B√∂defeld, she was built by German puppet makers and not the Muppet Workshop. After her short-lived Sesame career, she got her own ALF-like show called \\"Leonie L√∂wenherz\\" on ARD, featuring herself, her two lion brothers, and a few human characters. During this time period, older puppets were re-used for new characters such as Simson (on and off in 1989‚Äì2000), Samson's cousin; with slight changes being made to his appearance (equipped with a hat, a tie, or another article of clothing). Originally, Simson was only imagined by Samson and other characters doubted his existence, much like Big Bird and Mr. Snuffleupagus in the United States. In 2000, the cast was expanded further and the sets changed once again. Newcomers to the puppet cast were Feli Filu (2000‚Äì2007), the monster reporter, the comic duo Pferd the horse (2002‚Äìpresent) and Wolle the sheep (2002‚Äìpresent), as well as a few recurring grouches, and some Anything Muppets. In 2005, after a 27-year presence on the show, Tiffy was replaced with single mom Moni (2005‚Äì2007) and her pink and furry daughter Lena (2005‚Äì2009). Since then, Sesamstra√üe has been visited by the most diverse cast of supporting Muppets than any other international version of Sesame Street. One-shot characters include Super Franky, Grouchella, Knut K√∂ffelstr√∂m, Turbo Theo, as well as various wolves, dogs and other creatures. In 2006, German audience's long-time favorites Ernie and Bert began appearing regularly in newly produced German segments. For the 36th season, the two moved into their own apartment on Sesamstra√üe, above new human character Frau Kowalski, commenting on the street events from their balcony. As more and more previously used Muppets were borrowed from Sesame Workshop, more secondary characters evolved in their own sketches, such as the green Wolf vom W√∂rtersee in 2007. In 2003, the German co-production's 30th anniversary was celebrated with a press conference and Axel Schulz, Ernie, Bert and Elmo (performed by Kevin Clash) in attendance, as the show gave a donation of ‚Ç¨12,271.00 to UNICEF. Ernie and Bert appeared on a regular episode that year, as well as on the show's 30th anniversary TV special. Originally, an average episode used to consist of around 50 percent of American material, like most international co- productions of Sesame Street. From 2007 onwards, the American material has been used less often, so that eventually, an average Sesamstra√üe episode contains nomore than one or two American-produced sketches. In addition, much as on Sesame Street since 2002, Sesamstra√üe's street scenes began to feature mostly at the beginning of each episode. Since 2008, the show has been shot in high definition. On 24 December 2008, a German-produced, 45-minute Christmas special called Weihnachten mit Ernie und Bert aired, featuring Ernie, Bert, and an Anything Muppet Santa Claus. In 2011, more segments were produced to air both as standalone segments outside the show, and within: \\"Ernie & Bert Songs\\" and \\"Ernie & Bert M√§rchensongs\\". From 2010 to 2012, the street stories were all repeats from previous episodes, although other new content was still being produced. The show's 40th anniversary, on 1 October 2012, saw the introduction of new character Elmo: a resident of the street, who appeared in a tree house setting as the new host of the show. New characters included a female friend of Elmo's, played by Julia Stinshoff, and Susi Schraube, an inventive girl appearing in a series of stop-motion segments. Established characters such as Rumpel and Samson were retired (although Samson made special appearances on the show in 2013 and 2014), while Pferd, Wolle, and Finchen remain part of the cast. Established characters such as Cookie Monster and Grover made guest appearances. Super Grover 2.0 was also added to the show beginning in 2013. Characters The main character is Samson, a large brown bear who replaced Big Bird. Like Big Bird, Samson is a full-body muppet and is the main character. Samson likes to dance the mambo. \\"Feli Filu\\" is a reporter for the show, and has interviewed a number of German celebrities, including president Horst K√∂hler. Samson the bear and Tiffy the bird/monster replaced the main character Big Bird (Bibo) in 1978. Other characters added later were Uli von B√∂defeld, also called Herr von B√∂defeld (1978‚Äì1988), Finchen the Snail (1980s), Rumpel the Grouch (1989; a German relative of Oscar the Grouch), and Buh the Owl (1989). Newer additions are Feli Filu the Monster reporter, the comic duo Pferd the Horse, and Wolle the sheep, a few grouches (including Grouchella and an √úbergrouch) and some Anything Muppets. Germany's Grouch character is called Rumpel. He hates rain when others love it, but loves rain when others complain about it. He lives in a rain barrel. His best friend is his pet caterpillar named Gustav. Little Bird has made some cameos, Ernie and Bert are among the most popular characters on 'Sesamstra√üe'. In Germany there were dubbed by: * Ernie: Gerd Duwner (1973‚Äì1996), in the years 1997‚Äì2001 by Peter Kirchberger, and finally in 2001 by Michael Habeck . * Bert: Wolfgang Kieling (1973‚Äì1985). From 1986, after Kieling's death Horst Sch√∂n took over synchronization, followed by other speakers as Rolf Julich and Christian Rode . Since 2007, both of Martin Paas (Ernie) and Carsten Morar, Haffke (Bert) played, talked and synchronized. Leonie L√∂wenherz Leonie L√∂wenherz (Leonie Lionheart in English), a female lion, was featured for a very short time after the set and puppets were destroyed in a fire. Just like Uli von B√∂defeld, she was most likely built by German Fabula Filmpuppen Workshop, and not the Sesame Workshop. After her short-lived Sesame career, she got her own (ALF-like) show called \\"Leonie L√∂wenherz\\" on ARD, featuring herself, her two lion brothers, and a few human characters.  German Muppet characters  * Samson, a male brown bear, similar in role and full-body puppet, to Big Bird (1978‚Äì2009, 2013‚Äìpresent) * Simson, Samson's cousin and lookalike, often seen with a hat or a tie to distinguish him from Samson (on and off in 1989‚Äì2000) * Tiffy, a pink female bird (1978‚Äì2004, expected back in 2006) * Finchen, a (former male, now female) snail (on and off from 1978, 1989‚Äìpresent) * Rumpel, a green Grouch that lives in a rainbarrel. He has Gustav, a pet caterpillar (1989‚Äì2009) * Buh, a male owl (1989‚Äì2000) * Feli Filu, a blue female monster reporter (2000‚Äì2007) * Pferd, a male horse (2000‚Äìpresent) * Wolle, a male lamb (2000‚Äìpresent) * Lena, a pink monster baby (2005‚Äì2009) * Moni, a female photographer (2005‚Äì2009) * Uli von B√∂defeld, a male hedgehog-like creature (1978‚Äì1988) * Leonie L√∂wenherz, a lioness (1989-early 1990s)  Humans (1978‚Äì1986)  * Henning (Henning Venske, a German actor ‚Äì 1978‚Äì1979) * Lilo (Lieselotte Pulver, a Swiss actress ‚Äì 1978‚Äì1986) * Uwe (Uwe Friedrichsen, a German actor ‚Äì 1979‚Äì1982) * Horst (Horst Janson, a German actor ‚Äì 1979‚Äì1986) * Ute (Ute Willing, a German actress ‚Äì 1979‚Äì1986) * Ilse (Ilse Biberti, a German actress ‚Äì 1979‚Äì1982) * Elisabeth (Elisabeth Vitouch, a German actress ‚Äì 1979‚Äì1982) * Manfred (Manfred Krug, a German actor ‚Äì 1982‚Äì1986)  Humans (1986‚Äìpresent)  * Schorsch (Gernot Endemann, a German actor ‚Äì 1986‚Äì1999) * Bettina (Hildegard Krekel, a German actress ‚Äì 1986‚Äì1989) * Bettina 2 (Kirsten Spick, a German actress ‚Äì 1989‚Äì1999) * Opa Brass (Grandpa Brass in English)(Ferdinand Dux, a German actor ‚Äì 1992‚Äì2000) * Pensionswirtin Helmi (Senta Bonneval, a German actress ‚Äì 1995‚Äì1999) * Musiker Alex (Alexander Geringas, a Hit Music Producer ‚Äì 1995‚Äì2000) * Jiviana (Vijak Bajani, a German- Turkish actress ‚Äì 1995‚Äì2001) * Nils (Nils Julius, a German actor ‚Äì 2000‚Äì2010) * Caro (Caroline Kiesewetter, a German actress ‚Äì 2000‚Äì2002) * Caro 2 (Miriam Krause, a German actress ‚Äì 2002‚Äì2004) * Zauberer PePe (Wizard PePe in English) (Dirk Bach, a German comedian ‚Äì 2000‚Äì2007) * Anke (Anke Engelke, a German comedian ‚Äì 2003) * Mehmet (Mehmet Yƒ±lmaz, a German-Turkish actor ‚Äì 2003‚Äìpresent) * Ella (Franziska Troegner, a German actress ‚Äì 2003‚Äìpresent) * Annette (Annette Frier, a German actress & comedian ‚Äì 2005‚Äìpresent) * Frau Kowalski (Miss Kowalski in English) (Adele Neuhauser, 2008‚Äìpresent) Theme song The theme song for Sesamstra√üe is \\"Der, die, das\\", whose melody and lyrics have little resemblance to the English version on Sesame Street. Der, die and das are nominative German articles (so the song's title is literally \\"The, the, the\\"). In October 2012 this song was performed by the German Eurovision Song Contest winner Lena Meyer-Landrut who is accompanied by Elmo on the trumpet.

Sound financial management creates value and organizational agility through the allocation of scarce resources amongst competing business opportunities. It is thus an aid to the implementation and monitoring of business strategies and helps achieve business objectives. Managerial finance is interdisciplinary, borrowing from both managerial accounting and corporate finance. See Financial analyst #Corporate and other.  Approach The difference between a managerial and a technical approach can be seen in the questions one might ask of annual reports. The concern of a technical approach is primarily measurement. It asks: is the accounting correct, in that money is assigned to the right categories, and were accounting principles followed? The purpose of a managerial approach, however, is to understand what the figures mean. * Someone using such an approach might compare the returns to other businesses in their industry and ask: are we performing better or worse than our peers? If we are performing worse, what is the source of the problem? Do we have the same profit margins? If not, why? Do we have the same expenses? Are we paying more for something than our peers? * They may look at changes in asset balances or red flags that indicate problems with bill collection or bad debt. * They will analyze working capital to anticipate future cash flow problems.  Role of managerial accounting  To interpret financial results in the manner described above, managers use Financial analysis techniques. Managers also need to look at how resources are allocated within an organization. They need to know what each activity costs and why. These questions require managerial accounting techniques such as activity based costing. Managers also need to anticipate future expenses. To get a better understanding of the accuracy of the budgeting process, they may use variable budgeting.  Role of corporate finance  Managerial finance is also interested in determining the best way to use money to improve future opportunities to earn money and minimize the impact of financial shocks. To accomplish these goals managerial finance uses techniques borrowed from Corporate finance to address the following: * Working capital management - addressing short term current assets and current liabilities * Capital budgeting, i.e. valuation and funding of \\"projects\\" - addressing long term investments * Capital structure and dividend policy - addressing long-term financial capital See also * List of finance topics * :Category:Finance Further reading * Lawrence Gitman and Chad J.

Severtzov studied at the Moscow University and at the age of eighteen he came into contact with G.S. Karelin and took an interest in central Asia. In 1857 he joined a mission to Syr-Darya. On the expedition to the Syr Darya, he was captured by bandits and freed after a month. In 1865‚Äì68, he explored the Tian Shan mountains and Lake Issyk Kul. In 1877‚Äì78, he explored the Pamir Mountains, following a route close to the current Pamir Highway as far as Lake Yashil Kul on the Ghunt River. Severtzov wrote the Vertical and Horizontal Distribution of Turkestan Wildlife (1873), which included the first description of a number of animals. Among them is a subspecies of argali (wild sheep) later named after him: Ovis ammon severtzovi. He also described many new species and subspecies of birds. The Spotted Great Rosefinch Carpodacus severtzovi is among those named after him. Severtzov began to assemble a collection of birds in the estate of Petrovskoe. On 8 February 1885 he was returning home in a carriage along the frozen Ikorts river that feeds into the Don. The carriage broke the ice and plunged. While everyone extricated themselves and attempted to find a warm place nearby, he delayed by searching for his portfolio and collapsed. His driver froze to death.

Most often, the source ports presented here are modifications made by the Doom community, as opposed to the official Doom versions produced by id Software or affiliated companies. The Doom engine's source code was released to the public on December 23, 1997. Although Doom was originally created for MS-DOS, the original source release was for the subsequent Linux version, due to the use of a proprietary sound library in the DOS version. The original purpose of source ports was cross- platform compatibility, but shortly after the release of the Doom source code, programmers were correcting old, unaddressed Doom bugs and deficiencies in their own source ports, and later on introducing their own modifications to enhance game features and alter gameplay. The source code was originally released under a proprietary license that prohibited commercial use and did not require programmers to provide the source code for the modifications they released in executable form, but it was later re-released on October 3, 1999 under the GNU General Public License after requests from the community.  Personal computers   Linux, macOS, Windows  = GLDoom = One of the first source ports, and one of the better known ones, GLDoom was the first attempt to bring OpenGL accelerated graphics support to the Doom engine. The project died in 1999 when its source code was lost during an accident in the developer's home. In April 2010, however, the author rediscovered the GLDoom sources in one of his friend's hard drives and made several fixes. Despite this, development remains dormant as of April 11, 2010.http://gldoom.sourceforge.net/ = Boom and derivatives = Boom was a port for DOS of the Doom source code by TeamTNT. Boom fixed numerous software glitches and added numerous other software enhancements into the engine to such a degree that its additions have been incorporated into most modern versions of Doom source ports (such as PrBoom+, ZDoom and Doom Legacy). The last update of Boom, version 2.02, was released on October 22, 1998. In October 1999, Boom's source code was released.https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/TeamTNT/boom/boom202s Further development of Boom as a source port was continued for DOS as MBF, for Windows as PrBoom, and for Linux as LxDoom. The latter two later merged as PrBoom and also took on many of the MBF features, so PrBoom's own successor, PrBoom+, is effectively the modern equivalent of Boom.  LxDoom  LxDoom was a source port for Linux created by Colin Phipps in 1999 based on Boom. It particularly focussed on removing the limitations and bugs inherited from the original Doom, and increasing computational efficiency. In 2000, it was combined with PrBoom, a Windows source port, becoming its basis. PrBoom was from then available in both Windows and Linux versions.  RORDoom  RORDoom is a DOS-based source port created by Julian Aubourg and released in 2000. It was the first Doom source port to incorporate a feature allowing sectors to overlap other sectors (room-over-room), thus overcoming the inability of having a room on top of another room in the Doom engine.  Eternity Engine  The Eternity Engine is a Windows source port licensed under the GNU General Public License. It was first released on January 8, 2001 as version 3.29 beta 1. It was originally meant to power a Doom total conversion, but after that project went on hiatus (eventually being cancelled in 2006), the engine became the prime focus. The engine is based on Smack My Marine Up (SMMU). It includes such features as scripting, portals, polyobjects, and Heretic support.  Marine's Best Friend  Marine's Best Friend (MBF) is a DOS-based source port. It is based on Boom, and adds several new features including high resolution graphics, enhanced monster AI, emulation of the pre-release beta versions of Doom, and \\"helpers\\" that follow and help the player (specifically dogs, to which the name of the engine refers). It was developed by Lee Killough and is no longer updated. Its code was later used as the base of the source port Smack My Marine Up, which in turn was used to construct the Eternity Engine. Some of its code was also adopted in PrBoom. In August 2004, James Haley and Steven McGranahan ported Marine's Best Friend to Windows as WinMBF. WinMBF was last updated in January 2005.  PrBoom  PrBoom is a Doom source port derived from Linux and Windows ports of Boom and MBF that includes an optional OpenGL renderer, as well as options allowing it to restore the behavior of earlier executables (such as Doom version 1.9, Boom, and MBF) in essential ways. Initially designed for use in Windows and Linux, it has also been ported to AmigaOS 4, AROS, Dreamcast, GP2X, MorphOS, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Wii, and Rockbox. A variation named PrBoom+ provides enhanced demo recording and viewing capabilities. id Software's official Doom iPhone port is based on PrBoom.iPhone Doom Classic Progress Report The source port is packaged in the Ubuntu Software Center as well as Fedora's RPM software repository alongside Freedoom. PrBoom was last updated as version 2.5.0 on November 9, 2008. PrBoom+ was last updated as version 2.5.1.5.test on September 02, 2020http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.net/history.html. Although PrBoom and PrBoom+ are simpler than some other Doom source ports, they are often preferred as staying relatively close to the behavior of the original games, and have good demo support. However, some of the bug fixes and behavior changes of other ports may unbalance how levels made for the original games play, giving players certain advantages or disadvantages. = Doomsday Engine and derivatives = The Doomsday Engine is a GPLv2-licensed source port (incorporating the former jDoom, jHexen, and jHeretic) that runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.dengine.net Doomsday Engine website: about, news, builds, wiki, forums. The source port also supports Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic. Its hardware-accelerated engine supports 3D models, object and movement smoothing, shadows, dynamic lighting, and other features. It also includes XG line and sector types for editing extensions, as well as a built-in master server games browser (launcher).  Risen3D  Risen3D is a Windows-only fork of the Doomsday Engine (based on version 1.7.8, released on March 15, 2003). It was originally known as Boomsday, as it only added support for Boom map editing features. The most recent version, version 2.2.26, was released in July 2014. = DOSDoom and derivatives = DOSDoom, released on December 23, 1997, was the first Doom source port to be released. It was created by Chi Hoang, who took the original Linux release of the Doom source code and ported it back to DOS. It evolved to include several new features, which were previously unseen at the time shortly after the release of the original Doom source code, including translucency, high resolution, and 16-bit color rendering. DOSDoom was last updated on April 10, 1999, released as version 0.653.  Doom Legacy  Doom Legacy is a source port originally written as a fork of DOSDoom, introducing mouse-look, jumping, a console, 32-player deathmatch, skins, and, later, native Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X ports. It has also evolved to support many Boom features and 3D acceleration. Later releases include additional features, notably the ability for levels to contain floors directly over floors, added in version 1.31 released in December 2000, meaning levels are not required to be strictly 2D as they were in the original Doom engine games. It has its own scripting language, called Fragglescript. Version 2 has been in development for quite some time.  EDGE  Enhanced Doom Gaming Engine, or EDGE, is a port derived from DOSDoom. EDGE was first released on June 20, 2000. The most attractive feature of EDGE is its DDF system, which describes all game behavior inside text files external to the executable file. As a result, it is popular among modders, who use the extensibility to add many new weapons and features with far fewer of the limits present in other source ports. EDGE includes ports to many operating systems, including MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, BeOS, and Mac OS X. EDGE's final update, version 1.35, was released on April 9, 2011. 3DGE, the successor to EDGE, was first released on April 11, 2011. Among the new features are improved scripting abilities, bug fixes, OpenGL enhancements, support for Heretic, and split-screen multiplayer. It was last updated on August 22, 2016, though the team releases developmental versions far more frequently. The engine has ports to multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, OpenBSD, and the Sega Dreamcast. = Vavoom = Vavoom is a source port created by merging the Doom, Heretic, and Hexen: Beyond Heretic source trees to create a unified executable. It also features bits of the Quake source code (used predominantly for networking and rendering), and was the first source port to support Strife: Quest for the Sigil. It has been in development since September 1999, and was first released on June 14, 2000. Among its features are a true 3D polygonal engine with colored lighting and software, Direct3D and OpenGL renderers, freelook support, 3D floors, and support for Boom's extended attributes. The source port is packaged in the Fedora RPM software repository alongside free installers that grab the shareware levels for all the games used by the engine by default. Vavoom's latest version, version 1.33, was released on December 31, 2010. = ZDoom and derivatives = ZDoom is a source port targeted at Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The first version, version 1.11, was released on . ZDoom is one of the most advanced and feature-filled Doom source ports from an editing perspective, supporting Boom editing extensions, plus all of the extensions made in the version of the Doom engine used in Hexen: Beyond Heretic, as well as several other new features. In addition to Doom, it supports Chex Quest, Heretic, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Strife: Quest for the Sigil. Unlike many other source ports, ZDoom cannot play demos recorded with Vanilla Doom, including the intro demos found in the IWAD. The last version of ZDoom, version 2.8.1, was released on . On , ZDoom site administrator \\"randi\\" announced an end of development for ZDoom, recommending QZDoom or GZDoom instead.  csDoom  csDoom, or Client/Server Doom, was a source port based on ZDoom built expressly for playing multiplayer games of Doom over the Internet. It was the first port to use client/server network code (from QuakeWorld), allowing players to join Doom servers on-the-fly. The project was closed and its source was published under GPL by the creator in early 2001. Source code was closed until that. (It was violating GPL license of QuakeWorld, so its creator was forced to release it by John Carmack.)  GZDoom  GZDoom is a source port based on ZDoom that extends its feature set to include an OpenGL 3 renderer. It was released on August 30, 2005. GZDoom also boasts 3D floor support compatible with Doom Legacy and Vavoom, 3D model support, 360 degree skyboxes, and other features. Version 2.4.0 was the first version to be officially released on ZDoom.org alongside the release of QZDoom 1.3.0 on March 19, 2017.https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55739 The latest version of GZDoom, version 4.4.2, was released on June 16, 2020.https://zdoom.org/news  GZ3Doom  GZ3Doom is a source port based on GZDoom that adds Oculus Rift support to the engine, still supporting Doom, Doom II, Heretic, and Hexen.  Odamex  Odamex is a free, cross- platform modification of the Doom engine that allows players to easily join servers dedicated to playing Doom online. The goal of Odamex is to be the leading competitive and open source Doom port that can be played by anyone across any platform. Enhancements to the port include being able to toggle the physics from the original Doom engine or playing with enhanced physics, a 32-bit color renderer, the ability to download and install patch WADs on-the- fly, and the implementation of Capture The Flag and Team Deathmatch modes.  Skulltag and Zandronum  Skulltag was one of the multiplayer-centric Doom ports based on (G)ZDoom. It added 32-player multiplayer and different game modes: standard types such as deathmatch and capture the flag, and other modes such as co-operative waves and invasion maps. Skulltag had support for 3D models and high-resolution textures. The final version of Skulltag was released on November 7, 2010 as version 0.98d. Skulltag was shut down on June 7, 2012. Skulltag 98e was succeeded by Zandronum, which is made by the same developers after the original creator moved to another project. Zandronum was first released as version 1.0 on August 24, 2012. Zandronum improved support up to 64 players online per server and introduced software rendering for 3D floors, previously an OpenGL-only feature in Skulltag. Zandronum's most recent version is 3.0, released on September 7, 2017.  ZDaemon  ZDaemon is an online multiplayer source port for Doom. Players create an account and can then easily connect to multiplayer servers with the included server browser (ZDaemon Launcher). The ZDaemon Launcher also features access to the ZDaemon IRC channel through their own client called \\"ZRC\\" (ZDaemon Relay Chat). The latest version, 1.10.01, was released on March 15, 2018. To cut down on impersonation/spoofing, version 1.09 introduced in-game nick authentication, which allows players to use aliases (such as for clan tags), but only when they actually own the nick. ZDaemon also collects statistics from servers that have it enabled, as well as experience points, allowing players to level up as they play, though leveling up doesn't provide any in-game benefits. = Chocolate Doom = Chocolate Doom is a source port for Windows, Linux, macOS, AmigaOS 4, MorphOS, and other modern operating systems that is designed to behave as closely as possible to the original DOS executable (\\"Vanilla Doom\\"), going as far as to duplicate bugs found in the DOS executable, even bugs that make the game crash. This involves more than just leaving the bugs in the source code. Several bugs present in the DOS version (for example, the sky bug in Doom II) were fixed in the released Doom source code, so these bugs were re-created for Chocolate Doom. The first version of Chocolate Doom was released on September 7, 2005. As it is designed to be as close as possible to the DOS executable, it has no new features and lacks high resolution support. It supports OPL3 music emulation, as well as the standard MIDI output on its host operating system. It is a popular test engine for level designers, and among players who prefer unmodified Doom. By default, it simulates the behavior of doom.exe version 1.9 running under Windows 98, although it will simulate the executables from The Ultimate Doom or Final Doom if it detects their respective IWADs. The latest version of Chocolate Doom, version 3.0.0, was released on December 30, 2017. = Crispy Doom = Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of Chocolate Doom that provides a higher display resolution, removes the static limits of the Doom engine and offers further optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file, savegame, netplay and demo compatible with the original.  BeOS  This is a port of Doom compatible with BeOS operating system. More information about the BeOS availability of Doom can be found here: .  Acorn RISC OS  An open-source RISC OS port of Doom has emerged from Jeff Doggett, which supports Doom, Doom II, The Ultimate Doom, and Freedoom game files.  Amiga  Various versions of Doom exists for the Amiga computer. * ADoom is a native Amiga port based on ID's Linux source code (68k & PPC versions exist) * DoomAttack is another native Amiga port (68k AGA/RTG) * BOOM based on v2.02 (68k AGA)http://aminet.net/package/game/shoot/BOOM * ZDOOM based on v1.22 (68k AGA/RTG)http://aminet.net/search?query=ZDOOM * ODAMEX based on v0.64 (68k AGA/RTG)http://aminet.net/search?query=odamex All of the Amiga ports of Doom require the original IWADs.  OS X  Zandronum is designed specifically for Mac OS X. Source ports like Doomsday, Odamex or PrBoom are OS X-compatible but are primarily cross-platform projects intended to be as portable as possible.  Portable devices   Nintendo DS  A port of PrBoom was written for the Nintendo DS. PWADs and DEH patches are supported, but only by creating a separate file with arguments to load them on startup. Wi-Fi network play is supported when using a PrBoom server set up on a PC.  Digita OS  DOOMD was a port released for FlashPoint Technology's DigitaOS for digital cameras. The port is based directly on the 1997 source code release. Both Doom and Doom II IWADs are supported. Custom WADs are supported, but no selection interface has been implemented.Dedicated Doom handheld hacked from an old digital camerahttp://www.visi.com/~xevious/mamed/readmed.htm  iPod  A hack allowed 5th generation iPods to run a port of Doom.Doom ported to the iPod - Engadget It is also possible to run Doom on iPods running Rockbox's Rockdoom plugin (based on PrBoom). This requires installing Rockbox on a supported device, then installing Rockdoom, and finally copying the WAD file of the game to run. This makes Doom available on virtually all devices supported by Rockbox, but the actual implementation, restricted controls, device's power, and screen can make it unplayable.  Android  Several ports of Doom exist for Android.

It is a direct port of the original Doom engine, and as a result supports all IWADs and PWADs that were designed for the original executable. Support for Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders and Hexen was added.http://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_voir.php?id=3889  Other ports  These Doom source ports have the characteristic of running on virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine or Adobe Flash while still being based on the Doom engine's source code. Due to the nature of the latter, some of these ports have opted for using automatic parsing of C code (such as Adobe Alchemy), while others have adopted a major rewrite.  HTML5  Freedoom has been ported to the World Wide Web via Emscripten and asm.js under the name \\"boon\\".Play FreedoomEmscripten Demos  Adobe Flash  The most well-known version of Doom that does not run directly on native code is the Doom Triple Pack,Doom Triple Pack written in Adobe Alchemy and ActionScript. It is essentially a direct translation of the original C source into compiled Adobe Alchemy bytecode, which allows it to run in recent versions of the Adobe Flash Player.  Java  In the past, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to produce a Doom source port in Java such as DoomCottDoomcott, with broken Java Applet. or the Stark Engine,Stark engine, archived page. which were either abandoned or never gained enough functionality to be properly called source ports.

It opened in 1802 as a boys' school, and is run by the Benedictine monks and lay staff of Ampleforth Abbey. The school is in a valley with sports pitches, wooded areas and lakes. Its affiliated preparatory school, St Martin's Ampleforth, is across the valley at Gilling Castle. History Pupils work in the library at Ampleforth in 1943 The college began as a small school for 70 boys founded by Benedictine monks, at Ampleforth Abbey, in 1802. The school formally constituted as a Roman Catholic boarding school in 1900. Various buildings were slowly added, including the school theatre which was built in 1909. The first performances took place in 1910, and in 1922 a cinema projector was acquired, but could not be used until the following year when electric lighting and central heating were installed. The first boarding houses were founded in 1926 to accommodate the growing pupil numbers. In 1929, the Abbey gained ownership of Gilling Castle and opened a preparatory school. Gilling Castle Prep merged with the college's junior school in 1992 before taking on its current name St Martin's Ampleforth after absorbing another nearby prep school. In 2002, girls were admitted for the first time when the sixth form became coeducational. The first girls' boarding house, St Margaret's, was opened in 2004. Coeducation was extended to the Year 9 intake for the 2010‚Äì11 academic year and the college is now fully coeducational. Since the Catholic emancipation, Ampleforth gained a reputation as one of several schools, alongside The Oratory School and Stonyhurst, popular within the Roman Catholic aristocracy and labelled the \\"Catholic Eton\\".  College tramway  In 1895, the North Eastern Railway built a gauge tramway from Gilling station on the Thirsk to Malton Line. The tram was horse-drawn, and provided coal for the college to produce gas. It also transported passengers in open wagons. The tramway closed in 1923 when the college changed to electric lighting. Education Ampleforth and the Valley from the air The school says that its primary concern is to provide pupils with not just academic, sporting and other achievements, but also \\"a spiritual compass for life\\": moral principles to give guidance in a secular world; within a context where the \\"Benedictine ethos permeates pupils' experience\\". The Good Schools Guide called the school an \\"Unfailingly civilised and understanding top co-educational boarding Catholic school that has suffered from time to time as a result of its long liberal tradition.\\" The Guide adds also that there is \\"A refreshing openness and honesty about the place these days.\\" Its academic admissions policy is not as exacting as that exercised by some other English public schools. The school is typically between 150 ‚Äì 200 in the annual league tables of public examination results, although it was ranked 6th nationally in the 2004 \\"value added\\" table. It maintains a scholarship set, with about 5% of pupils gaining the offer of a place at Oxford or Cambridge. More than 90% go on to university. In 2018 the school failed an inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate regarding boarding provision, and the school was issued with a formal notice requiring the school to produce an Action Plan to resolve the failings. The Charity Commission had earlier removed pupil safeguarding responsibilities from the school's trustees, and the headmaster had been suspended from the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference over safeguarding concerns. In July 2019 it was reported that the school's acting head was stepping down after 10 months in the job. The move followed an unannounced inspection to monitor progress, carried out in May, at the request of the Department for Education, which found the school did not meet standards for safeguarding, leadership, behaviour, combating bullying and complaints handling. However, in Spring 2019 the school passed a compliance inspection under a new head. School life Though originally a boys' school the college is now fully co-educational. In 2009 an OFSTED Social Care report said that the overall quality of care was outstanding; in 2013 it was deemed \\"excellent\\". Ampleforth Abbey Houses Boys buy sweets from the tuck shop at Ampleforth in 1943 The school is arranged into ten houses, with pupils living in separate house buildings, eating together as a house for lunch 6 days a week, and playing sport in inter-house competitions. Each house is named after a British saint. Boys houses are St Cuthbert's, St Dunstan's, St Edward- Wilfrid's (as of September 2018 became Junior House) which were originally two separate houses, St Hugh's, St John's, St Oswald's, and St Thomas's, and girls, St Aidan's, St Bede's and St Margaret's. Some houses are paired into buildings named after people who have been instrumental in the school's history. Hume House building, named after Cardinal Basil Hume, combines St Cuthbert and St Edward-Wilfrid houses. Nevill House building combines St Dunstan and St Oswald houses. Bolton House building was formerly St Edward and St Wilfrid houses before their merger in 2001. Fairfax House building combines St Margaret and St Hugh houses. Controversy Fee-fixing In September 2005, Ampleforth was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found by the Office of Fair Trading to be operating a fee-fixing cartel in breach of the Competition Act of 1998. All of the schools were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of ¬£10,000 each (with minor exceptions) and make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that they were unaware that the law had changed, and that private schools had not known that they had become subject to competition law. Sexual abuse Several monks and three members of the lay teaching staff molested children in their care over several decades. In 2005 Father Piers Grant-Ferris admitted 20 incidents of child abuse. This was not an isolated incident. The Yorkshire Post reported in 2005: \\"Pupils at a leading Roman Catholic school suffered decades of abuse from at least six paedophiles following a decision by former Abbot Basil Hume [later a cardinal, and Archbishop of Westminster] not to call in police at the beginning of the scandal.\\" Following the case the Abbot, Cuthbert Madden, offered a \\"heartfelt apology\\" to the victims of one member of staff. The College thereafter put in place a safeguarding policy, subsequently judged inadequate (see below), but which was said to follow the local inter-agency procedures of the North Yorkshire Safeguarding Children Board and the guidance given in the Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2010 and the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools. In accordance with this policy, in 2016 Fr Madden temporarily stepped down from his role of Chairman of Governors during the investigation of indecent assault allegations made by four former pupils. Based on the evidence available no further action was taken. In April 2018 the Charity Commission appointed a lawyer to take charge of safeguarding at Ampleforth College, as it was not satisfied that the trustees of the charities that run the college had made enough progress in improving pupil safeguarding. Harvey Grenville, leader of investigation and enforcement for the Charity Commission, said, \\"It is of paramount importance that beneficiaries, and others who come into contact with charities, are protected from harm. We are not satisfied that the trustees of these charities have made enough progress in improving the safeguarding environment for pupils in the schools connected to the charities. For this reason, we have appointed an interim manager to expedite changes in the safeguarding arrangements at the schools\\". The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) investigated the English Benedictine Congregation, including Ampleforth College and Downside School, amongst other institutions, and published a report in August 2018. Ten individuals from the two schools, including monks, were convicted or accepted a caution for abuse. The report said that appalling abuse was inflicted on pupils over 40 years, but the schools tried to cover up appalling allegations. The Chair of the Inquiry, Prof. Alexis Jay, said that the schools for decades tried to avoid giving any information to police or authorities, with monks being \\"secretive, evasive and suspicious of anyone outside the English Benedictine Congregation\\", prioritising \\"the reputation of the Church and the wellbeing of the abusive monks\\" over safeguarding. After new procedures were introduced in 2001 following the Nolan Report, which recommended that abuse should be referred to the statutory authorities, monks gave the appearance of co-operation and trust, but in reality continued to cover up the abuse. Notable Old Amplefordians The school has educated many notable figures including Rupert Everett, David Stirling, Lord Fellowes of West Stafford, Lord Bamford, Sir Antony Gormley, James O'Brien, Timothy Oulton, actor James Norton, Rugby World Cup winner Lawrence Dallaglio, and historians William Dalrymple and John Keay. St. Bede‚Äôs Preparatory School, Bishton Hall Also Charles Stafford-Northcote, Headmaster of St. Bede's Preparatory School, Staffordshire (closed 2018) of which Lord Bamford was a former pupil and after: The University at Grenople. He donated the school's swimming pool roof with the proceeds of his inheritance from his father; Joseph Cyril Bamford (founder of the machinery company JCB). Also the Dukes of Norfolk (Earls of Arundel) went to Ampleforth with their family attending St. Bede's beforehand.

During small group communication, interdependent participants analyze data, evaluate the nature of the problem(s), decide and provide a possible solution or procedure. Additionally, small group communication provides strong feedback, unique contributions to the group as well as a critical thinking analysis and self- disclosure from each member. Small groups communicate through an interpersonal exchange process of information, feelings and active listening in both two types of small groups: primary groups and secondary groups.  Group communication  The first important research study of small group communication was performed in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood California by social psychologist Robert Bales and published in a series of books and articles in the early and mid 1950s .Bales, R. F. (1950). Interaction process analysis. Page 33. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.Bales, R. F. (1950). Interaction process analysis. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.Bales, R. F., and Strodtbeck, F. L. (1951). Phases in group problem-solving. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 46, 485-495. This research entailed the content analysis of discussions within groups making decisions about \\"human relations\\" problems (i.e., vignettes about relationship difficulties within families or organizations). Bales made a series of important discoveries. First, group discussion tends to shift back and forth relatively quickly between the discussion of the group task and discussion relevant to the relationship among the members. He believed that this shifting was the product of an implicit attempt to balance the demands of task completion and group cohesion, under the presumption that conflict generated during task discussion causes stress among members, which must be released through positive relational talk. Second, task group discussion shifts from an emphasis on opinion exchange, through an attentiveness to values underlying the decision, to making the decision. This implication that group discussion goes through the same series of stages in the same order for any decision-making group is known as the linear phase model. Third, the most talkative member of a group tends to make between 40 and 50 percent of the comments and the second most talkative member between 25 and 30, no matter the size of the group. As a consequence, large groups tend to be dominated by one or two members to the detriment of the others. Linear phase model The most influential of these discoveries has been the latter; the linear phase model. The idea that all groups performing a given type of task go through the same series of stages in the same order was replicated through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; with most finding four phases of discussion. For example, communication researcher B. Aubrey Fisher showed groups going sequentially through an orientation stage, a conflict stage, a stage in which a decision emerges and a stage in which that decision is reinforced.Fisher, B. A. (1970). Decision emergence: Phases in group decision making. Speech Monographs, 37, 53-66. Much of this research (although not necessarily Fisher's) had two fundamental flaws. First, all group data was combined before analysis, making it impossible to determine whether there were differences among groups in their sequence of discussion. Second, group discussion content was compared across the same number of stages as the researcher hypothesized, such that if the researcher believed there were four stages to discussion, there was no way to find out if there actually were five or more. In the 1980s, communication researcher Marshall Scott Poole examined a sample of groups without making these errors and noted substantial differences among them in the number and order of stages.Poole, M. S., & Roth, J. (1989). Decision development in small groups IV: A typology of group decision paths. Human Communication Research, 15, 323-356. He hypothesized that groups finding themselves in some difficulty due to task complexity, an unclear leadership structure or poor cohesion act as if they feel the need to conduct a \\"complete\\" discussion and thus are more likely to pass through all stages as the linear phase model implies, whereas groups feeling confident due to task simplicity, a clear leadership structure and cohesion are more likely to skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary. Idea development Another milestone in the study of group discussion content was early 1960s work by communication researchers Thomas Scheidel and Laura Crowell regarding the process by which groups examine individual proposed solutions to their problem.Scheidel, T. M., & Crowell, L. (1964). Idea development in small discussion groups. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 50, 140-145. They concluded that after a proposal is made, groups discuss it in an implied attempt to determine their \\"comfort level\\" with it and then drop it in lieu of a different proposal. In a procedure akin to the survival of the fittest, proposals viewed favorably would emerge later in discussion, whereas those viewed unfavorably would not; the authors referred to this process as \\"spiraling.\\" Although there are serious methodological problems with this work, other studies have led to similar conclusions. For example, in the 1970s, social psychologist L. Richard Hoffman noted that odds of a proposal's acceptance is strongly associated with the arithmetical difference between the number of utterances supporting versus rejecting that proposal. More recent work has shown that groups differ substantially in the extent to which they spiral.Hoffman, L. R. (1979). The group problem-solving process. New York: Praeger. Additional developments have taken place within group communication theory as researchers move away from conducting research on zero-history groups, and toward a \\"bona fide\\" groups perspective. The bona fide group, as described by Linda L. Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in 1990, fosters a sense of interdependence among the members of the group, along with specific boundaries that have been agreed upon by members over time.Putnam, L. L., & Stohl, C. (1990). Bona fide groups: A reconceptualization of groups in context. Communication Studies, 41, 3, 248-265. This provides researchers with model of group behavior that stays true to the characteristics displayed by most naturally occurring groups, (s).  Social influence in groups  Work relevant to social influence in groups has a long history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by Muzafer Sherif in 1935 using the autokinetic effect. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement in the presence of others and noted that these judgments tended to converge.Sherif, M. (1935). A study of some social factors in perception. Archives of Psychology, 27(187). The second of these was a series of studies by Solomon Asch, in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the \\"judgments\\" of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs.Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: 1. A minority of one against a unanimous majority. Psychological Monographs, 70(9), Whole #416. As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see conformity). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif's study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence should not be confused with compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the opinions of the group majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.  Culture  Culture affects the entire communication of a person. Within small groups there are three specific factors that affect communication. The first factor covers whether a person prioritizes their needs as more or less important than the group's necessities. The second important factor is power distance, the degree at which people accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. In high-power distance cultures and individual of low power would not disagree with an individual with more power than him. On the contrary, in low-power distance cultures everyone's input and opinions are taking into account in certain decisions. The third factor that affects communication in small groups is uncertainty avoidance. The degree of tolerance people have for risk. In high uncertainty cultures individuals expect and prefer rules and structurized systems. In those low uncertainty avoidance cultures, individuals prefer and are comfortable with constant change and scarce rules. Conflict resolution Any group has conflicts, topics that people do not agree on, different points of view on how to move forward with a task and so on. As a result, to be able to overcome any conflict that might arise, a six step conflict resolution will help to overcome the problem.Guffey, Mary E., Kathleen Rhodes and Patricia Rogin. Business Communication: Process and Product. 3rd ed. Toronto: Thomson South- Western, 2010. 32. Print. * All the group members have to listen carefully to each other * Understand the different points of view that were discussed * Be respectful and show interest in maintaining a good relationship with the group members regardless of their opinions * Try to find a common ground * Come up with new solutions to the problem or situation * Finally, reach on a fair agreement that will benefit everyone Group decisions During a small group decision the process can be more open, vulnerable and can rely on several decision techniques. A common process that small groups incorporate in decision making situations starts by a orientation where each member starts to familiarize or socialize with other members. Secondly, small group members face conflict, where each person shares ideas or possible solutions to a problem. This session is also known as brainstorming. During the conflict stage, subgroups or stronger personalities can emerge. Then, small group members advance to a consensus, where after evaluating several ideas the group agrees to advance. Lastly is closure, where small group team members agree completely on an idea and start taking action. By the end of the 1950s, studies such as Sherif's led to the reasonable conclusion that social influence in groups leads group members to converge on the average judgment of the individual members. As a consequence, it was a surprise to many social psychologists when in the early 1960s, evidence appeared that group decisions often became more extreme than the average of the individual predisposed judgment.Wallach, M. A., Kogan, N., & Bem, D. J. (1962). Group influence on individual risk taking. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 65, 75-86. This was originally thought to be a tendency for groups to be riskier than their members would be alone (the risky shift), but later found to be a tendency for extremity in any direction based on which way the members individually tended to lean before discussion (group polarization). Research has clearly demonstrated that group polarization is primarily a product of persuasion not compliance. Two theoretical explanations for group polarization have come to predominate. One is based on social comparison theory, claiming that members look to one another for the \\"socially correct\\" side of the issue and if they find themselves deviant in this regard, shift their opinion toward the extreme of the socially correct position.Baron, R. S., Dion, K. L., Baron, P. H., & Miller, N. (1971). Group consensus and cultural values as determinants of risk taking. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 20, 446-455. This would be an example of normative influence. The other 'persuasive arguments theory' (PAT), begins with the notion that each group member enters discussion aware of a set of items of information favoring both sides of the issue but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. Some of these items are shared among the members (all are aware of them), others are unshared (only one member is aware of each). Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are voiced, giving members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction.Vinokur, A., & Burnstein, E. (1974). Effects of partially shared persuasive arguments on group induced shifts: A group problem-solving approach. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29, 305-315. PAT is an example of informational influence. Although PAT has strong empirical support, it would imply that unshared items of information on the opposite side of the favored position would also come up in discussion, canceling the tendency to polarize. Research has shown that when group members all lean in one direction, discussion content is biased toward the side favored by the group, inconsistent with PAT. This finding is consistent with social comparison notions; upon discovering where the group stands, members only voice items of information on the socially correct side. It follows that an explanation for group polarization must include information influence and normative influence. The possibility exists that the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but that the majority of information known to each member individually, supports the other side of the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of information supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of information supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of information supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more information supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a \\"hidden profile\\" and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared items of information increases.Stasser, G., & Titus, W. (1985). Pooling of unshared information in group decision making: Biased information sampling during discussion. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, 81-93. Many methods may be used in reaching group decisions. The most popular method in Western culture is by majority, but other ways to make team decisions are available. Firstly, voting by majority brings quick decision making, and that is one of the reasons why it is the most widely used. A second method is by consensus. Reaching decisions by consensus is time consuming, but it allows everyone to bring forward their opinion. A third method is by averaging. This method requires all teammates to reach a decision by compromising. Reaching decisions by minority decision calls for a subcommittee getting together and reaching decisions without the whole groupe being involved. A final method is by authority rule. In this method, the group leader listens to individual group member's ideas, and has final say on a decision.  Nonverbal communication  Body language is a form of nonverbal communication, consisting of body pose, gestures, eye movements and paralinguistic cues (i.e. tone of voice and rate of speech). Humans send and interpret such signals unconsciously. It is often said that human communication consists of 93% body language and paralinguistic cues, while only 7% of communication consists of words themselvesBorg, John. Body Language: 7 Easy Lessons to Master the Silent Language. Prentice Hall life, 2008 \\\\- however, Albert Mehrabian, the researcher whose 1960s work is the source of these statistics, has stated that this is a misunderstanding of the findings (see Misinterpretation of Mehrabian's rule).  Physical expression  Physical expressions like waving, pointing, touching and slouching are all forms of nonverbal communication. The study of body movement and expression is known as kinesics. Humans move their bodies when communicating because as research has shown, it helps \\"ease the mental effort when communication is difficult.\\" Physical expressions reveal many things about the person using them for example, gestures can emphasize a point or relay a message, posture can reveal boredom or great interest, and touch can convey encouragement or caution.Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies. My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 137  Examples list  *Hands on knees: indicates readiness.Matthew McKay, Martha Davis, Patrick Fanning [1983] (1995) Messages: The Communication Skills Book, Second Edition, New Harbinger Publications, , , pp.56-57 *Hands on hips: indicates impatience. *Lock your hands behind your back: indicates self-control. *Locked hands behind head: states confidence. *Sitting with a leg over the arm of the chair: suggests indifference. *Legs and feet pointed in a particular direction: the direction where more interest is felt *Crossed arms: indicates submissiveness.Tarnow, E. (2005) Body language is a form of non-verbal communication involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. Humans, sometimes unconsciously, send and receive non-verbal signals all the time.  Body language and space  Interpersonal space refers to the psychological \\"bubble\\" that we can imagine exists when someone is standing far too close to us. Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart. Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends. The second zone is called personal distance and begins about an arm's length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away. We use personal distance in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions. The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you. Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances. The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you. This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies. My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 140-141 Language difficulties Misunderstandings in communication are common because of the many different factor, that is the way of conveying message; which is done through language. Though there is no right or wrong way to communicate, avoiding language barriers such as jargon, bypassing, and offensive language may prevent misunderstandings in group or interpersonal discussions. One of the more common barriers in communication is the inappropriate use of jargon. Jargon is a fictive language invented by and for the group as a verbal shorthand. It also syllabifies group membership when used properly. The problem with jargon is that it can make words confusing and can be used to conceal the truth. Another barrier to language is bypassing. Bypassing occurs when group members have different meanings for different words and phrases and thus miss each other's meanings. To overcome the risk of bypassing it is important to look to what the speaker wants and not always at what the speaker says. The third most common language barrier is offensive language. Offensive language is \\"any terminology that demeans, excludes, or stereotypes people for any reason. Avoiding sexist, discriminating, or labeling talk will greatly reduce chances of miscommunication. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to communicate. Though language difficulties are common, avoiding barriers like jargon, bypassing, and offensive language, will greatly reduce your chances of being misunderstood. Only through habitual awareness can one begin to truly understand and then be understood.Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.

He traveled as a young man in the United States, ultimately settling in Ohio in 1815, where he made notable contributions to botany, zoology, and the study of prehistoric earthworks in North America. He also contributed to the study of ancient Mesoamerican linguistics, in addition to work he had already completed in Europe. Rafinesque was an eccentric and erratic genius. He was an autodidact, who excelled in various fields of knowledge, as a zoologist, botanist, writer and polyglot. He wrote prolifically on such diverse topics as anthropology, biology, geology, and linguistics, but was honored in none of these fields during his lifetime. Indeed, he was an outcast in the American scientific community whose submissions were rejected automatically by leading journals. Among his theories were that ancestors of Native Americans had migrated by the Bering Sea from Asia to North America, and that the Americas were populated by numerous black indigenous peoples at the time of European contact. Biography Rafinesque was born on October 22, 1783, in Galata, a suburb of Constantinople. His father, F. G. Rafinesque, was a French merchant from Marseilles; his mother, M. Schmaltz, was of German descent and born in Constantinople. His father died in Philadelphia about 1793. Rafinesque spent his youth in Marseilles, and was mostly self-educated; he never attended university.Discovering Lewis & Clark: biography of Rafinesque; accessed : November 17, 2010\\"The oddest of characters\\" , American Heritage, April 1985; accessed November 17, 2010. By the age of 12, he had begun collecting plants for a herbarium. By 14, he taught himself Greek and Latin because he needed to follow footnotes in the books he was reading in his paternal grandmother's libraries. In 1802, at the age of 19, Rafinesque sailed to Philadelphia in the United States with his younger brother. They traveled through Pennsylvania and Delaware, where he made the acquaintance of most of the young nation's few botanists. In 1805, Rafinesque returned to Europe with his collection of botanical specimens, and settled in Palermo, Sicily, where he learned Italian. He became so successful in trade that he retired by age 25 and devoted his time entirely to natural history. For a time Rafinesque also worked as secretary to the American consul. During his stay in Sicily, he studied plants and fishes, naming many new discovered species of each. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1808. Career in the United States Rafinesque had a common-law wife. After their son died in 1815, he left her and returned to the United States. When his ship Union foundered near the coast of Connecticut, he lost all his books (50 boxes) and all his specimens (including more than 60,000 shells). Cited in . Settling in New York, Rafinesque became a founding member of the newly established Lyceum of Natural History. In 1817, his book or A Flora of the State of Louisiana was strongly criticized by fellow botanists, which caused his writings to be ignored. By 1818, he had collected and named more than 250 new species of plants and animals. Slowly, he was rebuilding his collection of objects from nature. In the summer of 1818, in Henderson, Kentucky, Rafinesque made the acquaintance of fellow naturalist John James Audubon, and in fact stayed in Audubon's home for some three weeks. Audubon, although enjoying Rafinesque's company, took advantage of him in practical jokes involving fantastic, made-up species. In 1819, Rafinesque became professor of botany at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where he also gave private lessons in French, Italian, and Spanish. He was loosely associated with John D. Clifford, a merchant who was also interested in the ancient earthworks that remained throughout the Ohio Valley. Clifford conducted archival research, seeking the origins of these mounds, and Rafinesque measured and mapped them. Some had already been lost to American development. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820. Rafinesque started recording all the new species of plants and animals he encountered in travels throughout the state. He was considered an erratic student of higher plants. In the spring of 1826, he left the university after quarreling with its president. He traveled and lectured in various places, and endeavored to establish a magazine and a botanic garden, but without success. He moved to Philadelphia, a center of publishing and research, without employment. He published The Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge, a Cyclop√¶dic Journal and Review, of which only eight issues were printed (1832‚Äì1833). He also gave public lectures and continued publishing, mostly at his own expense. Death Rafinesque died of stomach and liver cancer in Philadelphia on September 18, 1840. The cancer may have been induced by Rafinesque's self-medication years before with a mixture containing maidenhair fern. He was buried in a plot in what is now Ronaldson's Cemetery. In March 1924, what were thought to be his remains were transported to Transylvania University and reinterred in a tomb under a stone inscribed, \\"Honor to whom honor is overdue.\\" Work Biology Rafinesque published 6,700 binomial names of plants, many of which have priority over more familiar names. The quantity of new taxa he produced, both plants and animals, has made Rafinesque memorable or even notorious among biologists. The mule deer is one of many species first named by Rafinesque. Rafinesque applied to join the Lewis and Clark Expedition, but was twice turned down by Thomas Jefferson. After studying the specimens collected by the expedition, he assigned scientific names to the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), and the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Evolution Rafinesque was one of the first to use the term \\"evolution\\" in the context of biological speciation. Rafinesque proposed a theory of evolution before Charles Darwin. In a letter in 1832, Rafinesque wrote: > The truth is that Species and perhaps Genera also, are forming in organized > beings by gradual deviations of shapes, forms and organs, taking place in > the lapse of time. There is a tendency to deviations and mutations through > plants and animals by gradual steps at remote irregular periods. This is a > part of the great universal law of perpetual mutability in everything. Thus > it is needless to dispute and differ about new genera, species and > varieties. Every variety is a deviation which becomes a species as soon as > it is permanent by reproduction. Deviations in essential organs may thus > gradually become new genera. In the third edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch that acknowledged the ideas of Rafinesque. Rafinesque's evolutionary theory appears in a two-page article in the 1833 spring issue of the Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge (a journal founded by himself). Rafinesque held that species are not fixed; they gradually change through time. He used the term \\"mutations\\". He believed that evolution had occurred \\"by gradual steps at remote irregular periods.\\" This has been compared to the concept of punctuated equilibrium. He also held that the same processes apply to humans. Walam Olum In 1836, Rafinesque published his first volume of The American Nations. This included Walam Olum, a purported migration and creation narrative of the Lenape (also known by English speakers as the Delaware Indians). It told of their migration to the lands around the Delaware River. Rafinesque claimed he had obtained wooden tablets engraved and painted with indigenous pictographs, together with a transcription in the Lenape language. Based on this, he produced an English translation of the tablets' contents. Rafinesque claimed the original tablets and transcription were later lost, leaving his notes and transcribed copy as the only record of evidence. For over a century after Rafinesque's publication, the Walam Olum was widely accepted by ethnohistorians as authentically Native American in origin, but as early as 1849, when the document was republished by Ephraim G. Squier, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an ethnologist who had worked extensively in Michigan and related territories, wrote to Squier saying that he believed the document might be fraudulent. In the 1950s, the Indiana Historical Society published a \\"retranslation\\" of the Walam Olum, as \\"a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture\\".Walam Olum: or, Red Score, The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians. See Since the late 20th century, studies especially since the 1980s in linguistic, ethnohistorical, archaeological, and textual analyses suggest that the Walam Olum account was largely or entirely a fabrication. Scholars have described its record of \\"authentic Lenape traditional migration stories\\" as spurious. After the publication in 1995 of David Oestreicher's thesis, The Anatomy of the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Anthropological Hoax, many scholars concurred with his analysis. They concluded that Rafinesque had been either the perpetrator, or perhaps the victim, of a hoax. Other scholars, writers, and some among the Lenape continue to find the account plausible and support its authenticity. Study of prehistoric cultures Examples of calculating the value of Mayan numerals Rafinesque made a notable contribution to North American prehistory with his studies of ancient earthworks of the Adena and Hopewell cultures, especially in the Ohio Valley. He was the first to identify these as the \\"Ancient Monuments of America\\". He listed more than 500 such archaeological sites in Ohio and Kentucky. Rafinesque never excavated; rather, he recorded the sites visited by careful measurements, sketches, and written descriptions. Only a few of his descriptions were published, with his friend John D. Clifford's series \\"Indian Antiquities\\", eight long letters in Lexington's short-lived Western Review and Miscellaneous Magazine (1819‚Äì1820). Clifford died suddenly in 1820, ending his contributions. Rafinesque's work was used by others. For instance, he identified 148 ancient earthworks sites in Kentucky. All sites in Kentucky that were included by E. G. Squier and Davis in their notable Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley (1848), completed for the Smithsonian Institution, were first identified by Rafinesque in his manuscripts. Rafinesque also made contributions to Mesoamerican studies. The latter were based on linguistic data, which he extracted from printed sources, mostly those of travelers. He designated as Taino, the ancient language of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Others later also used the term to identify the ethnicity of indigenous Caribbean peoples. Although mistaken in his presumption that the ancient Maya script was alphabetical in nature, Rafinesque was probably first to insist that studying modern Mayan languages could lead to deciphering the ancient script. In 1832, he was the first to partly decipher ancient Maya. He explained that its bar-and-dot symbols represent fives and ones, respectively. The genus Rafinesquia was named in Rafinesque's honor. Legacy According to historian George Daniels, Rafinesque was a brilliant but erratic naturalist who roamed the American wilderness. His style was offputting to the emerging professionalization of science and achievements were controversial at the time and by historians ever since. By 1820 he was virtually an outcast in the scientific community as all the important publications rejected his submissions. The two leading American scientists of the day Benjamin Silliman and Asa Gray were harshly critical. Modern historians agree that Rafinesque was often hasty, and tried to claim credit properly due to other researchers. Scientists were troubled that his theory of evolution ‚Äì long before Darwin ‚Äì seemed to be based more on his speculation and exaggerations than on solid research. Despite all his faults, says Daniels, \\"he made enormous contributions to the natural history phase of American science...with the establishment of 34 genera and 24 species of American fishes.\\" He was also a brilliant teacher at Transylvania University. George H. Daniels, \\"Rafinesque, Constantine Samuel\\" in John A. Garraty, Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 886‚Äì887. *In 1841, Thomas Nuttall named a new genus Rafinesquia after Rafinesque. He felt indebted to the naturalist, who had inspired his work and given Nuttall's Flora a positive review. The genus now contains two species, Rafinesquia californica Nutt. (California plumeseed or California chicory) and Rafinesquia neomexicana A. Gray (desert chicory or plumeseed). *In 1892, James Hall and J. M. Clarke proposed the genus name Rafinesquina in honor of Rafinesque for a number of fossil brachiopod species then belonging to genus Leptaena; the genus is now in the family Rafinesquinidae.

History The series debuted on October 22, 1996 on TV channels NTV and ORT and was themed in English, Life in an open society. The Muppet characters include a seven-foot-tall Dvorovoi (spirit) named Zelibobahttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/sesame-street-and-muppet- diplomacy/ and two monsters, Businka and Kubik. Natasha Lance Rogoff served as Executive Producer for Sesame Workshop. The second season on \\"optimism\\" was filmed in 1999 and broadcast on NTV and STS. Filming the third season, the main theme was \\"Diversity in the world\\". The program was broadcast on television channel STS. In the third season, famous celebrities appeared on the show: actors Leo Durov and Mary Aronov, composer Grigory Gladkov, and opera singer Vyacheslav Voynorovsky. In 2006, the show celebrated its 10th anniversary. Filming of the new fourth season took place in the spring of 2006 in the pavilions \\"Mosfilm\\". The premiere of the new season was broadcast on STS channel in September 2006. The city yard set is re-vamped to reflect a more realistic depiction of modern-day urban Russia. An intact oak tree grows in the center of this courtyard, and windows from surrounding houses face each other so neighbors can pop their heads out to greet one another. The set includes a creative art center and a playground with an urban backdrop of buildings that was made grittier, a bit grey, with Khrushchev-style buildings in the background. Businka and Kubik's rooms change into a two-story house with a balcony. New cast members include Yamila and Altin, who are two sisters, recently arrived in Russia from Kazakhstan. The show tackled the issue of adoption by introducing a young boy named Kolya who was adopted by Aunt Dinara and her husband, Uncle Jura. Season 4 introduced a new recurring segment inspired by Prairie Dawn's art show from Play with Me Sesame where Businka shows artwork done by kids. Famous celebrities include TV presenter Tina Kandelaki, actress Olga Prokofiev (\\"My Fair Nanny\\") and Ekaterina Guseva, Vladimir Turchinsky (Dynamo Moscow), Natasha Podolsk, Varvara, Vladimir Asimov, and children's group \\"Fidget\\". The show also features Sesame Street clips dubbed in Russian, as well as dubbed clips from Elmo's World, Global Grover and Play with Me Sesame.

Alexander Theodor von Middendorff (; tr. ; 18 August 1815 ‚Äì 24 January 1894) was a Russian zoologist and explorer of Baltic German and Estonian extraction.  Early life  Middendorff's mother Sophia Johanson (1782‚Äì1868), the daughter of an Estonian farmer, had been sent to Saint Petersburg for education by her parents. There she met with the future director of the St. Petersburg Pedagogical Institute, Theodor Johann von Middendorff (1776‚Äì1856), whose father was a Baltic German pastor in Karuse, Estonia. As the two young people came from different social ranks and were unable to marry each other, their daughter Anette (b. 1809) and son Alexander were born out of wedlock. Alexander was born on 18 August 1815 in St. Petersburg, but could not be baptized until six months later in the Estonian Lutheran Congregation of St. Petersburg, as the German Lutheran Congregation of St. Petersburg had not agreed to perform the baptism. In the accompanying paperwork, Middendorff's parents registered themselves as a married couple. In order to escape the attention of the public, the mother and son returned to Estonia, where they settled at the P√∂√∂ravere Mansion. Only in 1824, when the young Middendorff was ready to go to school, was his status legitimized when his parents finally married.Academic Middendorff and Estonians. Eesti Ekspress., 08.29.2005 (in Estonian) (Note: Although his father Theodor was Baltic German, Middendorff's middle name is sometimes spelled as \\"Theodorowitsch\\", a German corruption of the Russian patronymic –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á (Fyodorovich); \\"-ovich\\" meaning \\"the son of\\" the person (father) whose name precedes it.)  Education  Middendorff received his early education from tutors in Reval and at a gymnasium in Saint Petersburg. From 1832 he pursued a medical degree at the Imperial University of Dorpat where his professors included Georg Friedrich Parrot, Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov, Hermann Martin Asmuss, and Alexander Friedrich von Hueck. Middendorff graduated in 1837 with a dissertation (written in Latin) on polyps in the bronchi. He then undertook further studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, University of Vienna, and University of Breslau. In 1839, under the patronage of Karl Ernst von Baer, he accepted a job at Kiev University.  Explorer and scientist  In 1839, Middendorff became Assistant Professor of Zoology at Kiev University. In the summer of 1840, Baer asked Middendorff to join his second expedition to Novaya Zemlya (the first one took place in 1837). Due to stormy conditions the expedition failed to reach Novaya Zemlya, but Baer and Middendorff explored Russian and Norwegian Lapland, as well as the Barents and White Seas. Middendorff was tasked with crossing on foot the Kola Peninsula and mapping the peninsula from Kola to Kandalaksha while collecting zoological and botanical material. From 1843 to 1845, on behalf of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, he travelled to the Taymyr Peninsula and then along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk and entered the lower Amur River valley (which at this time was Chinese territory). He published his findings in Reise in den √§u√üersten Norden und Osten Sibiriens (Travels in the extreme north and east of Siberia) in German (1848‚Äì1875), which included an account of the effects of permafrost on the spread of animals and plants. He also wrote Die Isepiptesen Russlands (1855), an account of bird migration in Russia, and a monograph on molluscs, Beitr√§ge zu einer Malacozoologia Rossica (1847‚Äì1849), in which he coined the term radula. In 1870 he visited the Baraba steppe and in 1878 the Fergana Valley. He died at Hellenurme in Livonia, present-day Valga County, Estonia. Middendorff's grasshopper warbler, Cape Middendorff of Novaya Zemlya, Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi), and Middendorff Bay of the Taymyr Peninsula are named after him.

TI Basic is based on Dartmouth BASIC and complies to the American National Standard for minimal Basic (ANSI X3.60-1978). Text, full screen graphics, logic operations, and recording to tape or any other file system, were supported by TI BASIC. Texas Instruments also produced TI Extended BASIC cartridge that enhanced the functionality accessible to BASIC users.  Elements of TI BASIC   Statements  The statements of TI BASIC are CALL, CLOSE, DATA, DEF, DIM, DISPLAY, END, FOR..TO..STEP, GOSUB, GOTO, IF..THEN..ELSE, INPUT, LET, NEXT, ON..GOSUB, ON..GOTO, OPEN, OPTION BASE, PRINT, RANDOMIZE, READ, REM, RESTORE, RETURN, STOP Every line of TI BASIC can only contain one statement. The possibility to put several statements in a line with :: and also the necessary PEEK and LOAD calls to use assembly language routines became available in TI Extended BASIC. Note that there is no POKE statement in TI BASIC. Loading and executing machine code requires a 32K memory expansion and the TI Editor/Assembler or TI Mini Memory cartridgehttps://www.ninerpedia.org/wiki/Mini_Memory, which then gives access CALL LOAD. The 256 Bytes of RAM directly accessible by the CPU was mostly consumed by the BASIC interpreter. TI BASIC stored and ran programs from the 16K video RAM, and, unlike TI Extended BASIC, could not take advantage of the 32K memory expansion.  Functions  Unlike Microsoft BASICs, which used LEFT$, MID$, RIGHT$, and INSTR for manipulating strings, TI BASIC used the ANSI-compliant SEG$ and POS. * ABS Absolute value * ASC ASCII numeric value of the first character of a string * ATN Arctangent * CHR$ Convert a number into a string with an ASCII character * COS Cosine * EOF Test whether the end of a file has been reached * EXP Exponentiation * INT greatest integer less than or equal to the parameter * LEN Length of a string * LOG Natural logarithm * POS First occurrence of a string in another string * RND Pseudorandom number generator * SEG$ Return a substring of a string * SGN Sign function * SIN Sine * SQR Square root * STR$ Convert a number to a string * TAN Tangent * VAL Convert a string to a number  Subprograms  Subprograms are called with CALL statement (e.g. CALL CLEAR). There are no user defined subprograms (this is possible in TI Extended BASIC), but some subprograms are predefined: * CHAR Definition of graphical characters * CLEAR Clears the screen * COLOR Defines foreground- and background color for 8 characters * GCHAR Reads one character at a specified position from the screen * HCHAR Writes a character to a screen position and repeats it horizontally * JOYST Returns the position of the joystick * KEY Reads from the keyboard without echo on the screen * SCREEN Changes the color of the screen * SOUND Creates sounds (using a frequency) and noise * VCHAR Writes a character to a screen position and repeats it vertically  Development  Texas Instruments designed a virtual machine with a language or intermediate representation called GPL, for \\"Graphic Programming Language\\". TI BASIC was written in GPL, which is unique to the TI-99 line. Although widely blamed for the slow performance of TI-BASIC, part of the problem was that the virtual machine was stored in graphics ROM, which had a slow 8-bit interface.) TI Extended BASIC improved execution speed somewhat by providing some functionality in assembly language, and the ability to concatenate multiple statements in a single line of code.

It can be used in conjunction with the Sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups. The transfer was defined by and rediscovered by . Construction The construction of the map proceeds as follows:Following Scott 3.5 Let [G:H] = n and select coset representatives, say :x_1, \\\\dots, x_n,\\\\, for H in G, so G can be written as a disjoint union :G = \\\\bigcup\\\\ x_i H. Given y in G, each yxi is in some coset xjH and so :yx_i = x_jh_i for some index j and some element hi of H. The value of the transfer for y is defined to be the image of the product :\\\\textstyle \\\\prod_{i=1}^n h_i in H/H‚Ä≤, where H‚Ä≤ is the commutator subgroup of H. The order of the factors is irrelevant since H/H‚Ä≤ is abelian. It is straightforward to show that, though the individual hi depends on the choice of coset representatives, the value of the transfer does not. It is also straightforward to show that the mapping defined this way is a homomorphism. Example If G is cyclic then the transfer takes any element y of G to y[G:H]. A simple case is that seen in the Gauss lemma on quadratic residues, which in effect computes the transfer for the multiplicative group of non-zero residue classes modulo a prime number p, with respect to the subgroup {1, ‚àí1}. One advantage of looking at it that way is the ease with which the correct generalisation can be found, for example for cubic residues in the case that p ‚àí 1 is divisible by three. Homological interpretation This homomorphism may be set in the context of group cohomology (strictly, group homology), providing a more abstract definition.Serre (1979) p.120 The transfer is also seen in algebraic topology, when it is defined between classifying spaces of groups. Terminology The name transfer translates the German Verlagerung, which was coined by Helmut Hasse. Commutator subgroup If G is finitely generated, the commutator subgroup G‚Ä≤ of G has finite index in G and H=G‚Ä≤, then the corresponding transfer map is trivial. In other words, the map sends G to 0 in the abelianization of G‚Ä≤. This is important in proving the principal ideal theorem in class field theory.Serre (1979) p.122 See the Emil Artin-John Tate Class Field Theory notes.  See also  * Focal subgroup theorem, an important application of transfer * By Artin's reciprocity law, the Artin transfer describes the principalization of ideal classes in extensions of algebraic number fields.

P. Sippy. The film is about two criminals, Veeru and Jai (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan respectively), hired by a retired police officer (Sanjeev Kumar) to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests, Basanti and Radha, respectively. Sholay is considered a classic and one of the best Indian films. It was ranked first in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \\"Top 10 Indian Films\\" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the 50th Filmfare Awards named it the Best Film of 50 Years. The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198 minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204 minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. The film was also an overseas success in the Soviet Union. It was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, and was the highest-grossing film in India up until Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994). By some accounts, Sholay remains the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation. The film is a Dacoit Western (sometimes called a \\"Curry Western\\"), combining the conventions of Indian dacoit films with that of Spaghetti Westerns along with elements of Samurai cinema. Sholay is also a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory.For glorification of violence, see Wimal Dissanayake, Malti Sahai, Sholay: A Cultural Reading (Delhi: Wiley Eastern, 1992), 115-19. ; for feudal ethos, see Hrishikesh Ingle, \\"Regionalist Disjuncture in Bollywood\\", in Vikrant Kishore et al., eds., Salaam Bollywood: Representations and interpretations (London: Routledge, 2016), 202. ; on social order/disorder, see Dissanayake, \\"The Concepts of Evil and Social Order in Indian Melodrama: An Evolving Dialect\\", in Melodrama and Asian Cinema, ed.

The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re- released to theatres in the 3D format.  Plot  In the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman Thakur Baldev Singh summons a pair of small- time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duoVeeru and Jaiwould be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh, a dacoit wanted by the authorities for a 50,000 reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional 20,000 reward. The two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Though Thakur has a gun within his reach, he does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and had both his arms cut off a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl. Living in Ramgarh, the jovial Veeru and cynical Jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers. Veeru is attracted to Basanti, a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse-cart. Jai is drawn to Radha, Thakur's reclusive, widowed daughter-in-law, who subtly returns his affections. Skirmishes between Gabbar's gang and Jai-Veeru finally result in the capture of Veeru and Basanti by the dacoits. Jai attacks the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place. Meanwhile, Jai, who is continuing the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range. Veeru returns, and Jai dies in his arms. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and catches the dacoit. Veeru nearly beats Gabbar to death when Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the promise to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and destroy his hands. The police then arrive and arrest Gabbar. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train. Radha is left alone again.  Cast   Production   Development  The screenwriter pair Salim‚ÄìJaved, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, began narrating the idea for Sholay as a four-line snippet to filmmakers in 1973. The idea was rejected by two producer/director teams, including directors Manmohan Desai and Prakash Mehra. About six months after the release of Zanjeer (1973), Salim-Javed got in touch with G. P. Sippy and his son Ramesh Sippy, and narrated the four-line snippet to them. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept of Sholay and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge the murder of his family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances. The film's script and dialogues are in Hindustani, or more precisely in Urdu. Salim-Javed wrote the dialogues in Urdu script, which was then transcribed by an assistant into Devanagari script so that Hindi readers could read the Urdu dialogues. The film's plot was loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 samurai cinema film, Seven Samurai. Sholay is a defining example of the Dacoit Western film, combining the conventions of Indian dacoit films, especially Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957) and Nitin Bose's Gunga Jumna (1961), with that of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) as well as The Magnificent Seven (1960). It also has some plot elements borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in Gunga Jumna, and has also been compared to a similar scene in North West Frontier (1959). A scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West. Sholay may have also been influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Westerns, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), and George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). The character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. Gabbar Singh was also influenced by larger-than-life characters in Pakistani author Ibn-e-Safi's Urdu novels, Dilip Kumar's dacoit character Gunga from the film Gunga Jumna who speaks with a similar mixed Khariboli and Awadhi dialect, and villains from Sergio Leone's films. Sippy wanted to do away with the clich√©d idea of a man becoming a dacoit due to societal issues, as was the case in other films, and focused on Gabbar being an emblem of pure evil. To emphasise the point of Gabbar being a new type of villain, Sippy avoided the typical tropes of dacoits wearing dhotis and pagris and sporting a Tika and worshipping \\"Ma Bhavani\\"; Gabbar would be wearing army fatigues. The character of the jailer, played by Asrani was influenced by Adolf Hitler. Javed Akhtar brought a book on World War II which had several pictures of Hitler posing to set the typical posture of the character in the film. Asrani spiced up his character with some ideas about Hitler's speech delivery he had heard from a teacher in FTII. The trademark 'Ha Ha' at the end of his monologues was inspired by a similar performance by Jack Lemmon in The Great Race. Soorma Bhopali, a minor comic relief character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from Bhopal named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter. The main characters' names, Jai and Veeru, mean \\"victory\\" and \\"heroism\\" in Hindi.  Casting  The producers considered Danny Denzongpa for the role of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed \\"felt he had the audience's sympathy through roles he'd done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful.\\" Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not very popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself. He was cast after Salim-Javed recommended him for Sholay in 1973; Bachchan's performance in their first collaboration, Zanjeer, convinced Salim-Javed he was the right actor for the film. Salim-Javed were impressed with Bachchan's performance in Raaste Kaa Patthar (1972), and at Bachchan's request, Dharmendra had personally put in a word for him. All these factors ensured that the role was Bachchan's. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Salim-Javed approached Dilip Kumar to play Thakur's role, but he turned down the offer; Dilip Kumar later said it was one of the few films he regretted turning down. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested to play the role of Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Hema Malini was reluctant to play the role of a tangewali, more so after Sippy told her that the film belongs to Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan, but she trusted Sippy to give her a meaty role, given that he had played a huge role in essaying her stardom. During the film's production, four of the leads became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to shooting delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By the time of the film's release, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him to spend more time with her. The couple married five years after the film's release.  Filming  alt=A rocky outcrop such as those used in filming Sholay Much of Sholay was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, a town near Bangalore, Karnataka. The filmmakers had to build a road from the Bangalore highway to Ramanagara for convenient access to the sets. Art director Ram Yedekar had an entire township built on the site. A prison set was constructed near Rajkamal Studio in Bombay, also outdoors, to match the natural lighting of the on-location sets. One part of Ramanagara was for a time called \\"Sippy Nagar\\" as a tribute to the director of the film. , a visit to the \\"Sholay rocks\\" (where much the film was shot) was still being offered to tourists travelling through Ramanagara. Filming began on location on 3 October 1973, with a scene featuring Bachchan and Bhaduri. The film had a lavish production for its time (with frequent banquets and parties for the cast), took two and a half years to make, and went over budget. One reason for its high cost was that Sippy re-filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect. \\"Yeh Dosti\\", a 5-minute song sequence, took 21 days to shoot, two short scenes in which Radha lights lamps took 20 days to film because of lighting problems, and the shooting of the scene in which Gabbar kills the imam's son lasted 19 days. The train robbery sequence, shot on the Bombay‚ÄìPoona railway route near Panvel, took more than 7 weeks to complete. Sholay was the first Indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the 70 mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70 mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35 mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, \\"A 70 mm [sic] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator.\\" The use of 70 mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: \\"The greatest star cast ever assembled ‚Äì the greatest story ever told\\".  Alternate version  The director's original cut of Sholay has a different ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board was concerned about the violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204 minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198 minutes long.  Themes  Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. Koushik Banerjea, a sociologist in the London School of Economics, notes that Sholay exhibits a \\"sympathetic construction of 'rogue' masculinity\\" exemplified by the likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru. Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes. Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought \\"a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order\\" to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh. Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975. Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully \\"Indianised\\". As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in Sholay with a similar scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, notes that Sholay infuses the style of the Western genre into a \\"feudalistic ethos\\". Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholays \\"hysterical visual style\\" and intermittent \\"populist message\\". Cultural critic and Islamic scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle. Some scholars have indicated that Sholay contains homosocial themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style. Dina Holtzman, in her book Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).  Music  R. D. Burman composed the film's music, and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The songs used in the film, and released on the original soundtrack are listed below. Following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack. The song \\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\\" was sung by its composer, R. D. Burman, who received his sole Filmfare Award nomination for playback singing for his effort. The song, which is often featured on Bollywood hit song compilations, is based on \\"Say You Love Me\\" by Greek singer Demis Roussos. \\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\\" has been extensively anthologised, remixed, and recreated. A version was created in 2005 by the Kronos Quartet for their Grammy-nominated album You've Stolen My Heart, featuring Asha Bhosle. It was also remixed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya, along with Bhosle, in his debut acting film Aap Kaa Surroor (2007). \\"Yeh Dosti\\" has been called the ultimate friendship anthem. It was remixed and sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Udit Narayan for the 2010 Malayalam film Four Friends, and also in 2010 it was used to symbolise India's friendship with the United States during a visit from President Barack Obama. Several songs from the soundtrack were included in the annual Binaca Geetmala list of top filmi songs. \\"Mehbooba Mehooba\\" was listed at No. 24 on the 1975 list, and at No. 6 on the 1976 list. \\"Koi Haseena\\" was listed at No. 30 in 1975, and No. 20 in 1976. \\"Yeh Dosti\\" was listed at No. 9 in 1976. Despite the soundtrack's success, at the time, the songs from Sholay attracted less attention than the film's dialogue‚Äîa rarity for Bollywood. The producers were thus prompted to release records with only dialogue. Taken together, the album sales reached an unprecedented 500,000 units. By 1979, the soundtrack went Platinum (equivalent to 1million sales at the time), becoming one of the top-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the 1970s. Music critic Oli Marlow reviewed the soundtrack in 2013, calling it a unique fusion of religious, folk, and classical music, with influences from around the world. He also commented on the sound design of the film, calling it psychedelic, and saying that there was \\"a lot of incredible incidental music\\" in the film that was not included in the soundtrack releases. In a 1999 paper submitted to London's Symposium on Sound in Cinema, film critic Shoma A. Chatterji said, \\"Sholay offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes. Sholay is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet, intensifying the drama.\\"  Reception   Box office  Sholay was released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day, in Bombay. Due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. From the third week, however, viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth. During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan's character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea. After being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets, Sholay soon became an \\"overnight sensation\\". The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975. It became the highest- grossing Bollywood film of 1975, and film ranking website Box Office India has given the film a verdict of \\"All Time Blockbuster\\". Sholay went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees across India, and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee at over 100 theatres. It was shown continuously at Bombay's Minerva theatre for over five years. Sholay was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001. Exact figures are not available on the budget and box office earnings of Sholay, but film trade sources provide estimates of its success. According to Box Office India, Sholay earned about in net income (valued at about US$16,778,000 in 1975) in India during its first run, which was many times its 30 million (valued at about US$3,355,000 in 1975) budget. Those earnings were a record that remained unbroken for nineteen years, which is also the longest amount of time that a film has held the record. Its original gross was increased further with re- releases during the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. The film's total gross revenue in India amounted to (). Box Office India estimates the film's total footfalls in India as over 100million tickets sold. The film was also an overseas success in the Soviet Union, where it was released in 1979. The film sold 48.4million tickets during its initial run at the Soviet box office, before eventually selling 60million tickets including re-runs. The film was also released in China, as two parts in 1988. It was the highest- grossing Indian film ever up until Disco Dancer (1982), and the highest- grossing film in India up until Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994). It is often cited that, after adjusting the figures for inflation, Sholay remains one of the highest-grossing films in the history of Indian cinema, although such figures are not known with certainty. Box Office India estimated as Sholay's adjusted domestic net income in 2008, while Times of India estimated over as the adjusted domestic gross in 2009. Mid Day estimated the film's total adjusted gross as () in 2014. In terms of footfalls, the film is estimated to have sold over 100million tickets in India, in addition to 60million tickets in the Soviet Union. In 1985, India Today estimated that the film drew a total audience of 250million, which is comparable to the number of tickets sold by some of the world's highest-grossing films of all time adjusted for inflation.  Critical response  Initial critical reviews of Sholay were negative. Among contemporary critics, K.L. Amladi of India Today called the film a \\"dead ember\\" and \\"a gravely flawed attempt\\". Filmfare said that the film was an unsuccessful mincing of Western style with Indian milieu, making it an \\"imitation western‚Äîneither here nor there.\\" Others labelled it as \\"sound and fury signifying nothing\\" and a \\"second-rate take-off\\" of the 1971 film Mera Gaon Mera Desh. Trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop. In a 1976 article in the journal Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, author Michael Gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film, but otherwise criticised it stating, \\"As a spectacle it breaks new ground, but on every other level it is intolerable: formless, incoherent, superficial in human image, and a somewhat nasty piece of violence\\". Over time, the critical reception to Sholay greatly improved; it is now considered a classic, and among the greatest Hindi-language films. In a 2005 BBC review, the well- rounded characters and simple narrative of the film were commended, but the comical cameos of Asrani and Jagdeep were considered unnecessary. On the film's 35th anniversary, the Hindustan Times wrote that it was a \\"trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music,\\" and that \\"practically every scene, dialogue or even a small character was a highlight.\\" In 2006, The Film Society of Lincoln Center described Sholay as \\"an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure, comedy, music and dance\\", labelling it an \\"indisputable classic\\". Chicago Review critic Ted Shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and \\"slapdash\\" cinematography, and noted that the film \\"alternates between slapstick and melodrama\\". In their obituary of the producer G.P. Sippy, the New York Times said that Sholay \\"revolutionized Hindi filmmaking and brought true professionalism to Indian script writing\\".  Awards  Sholay was nominated for nine Filmfare Awards, but the only winner was M. S. Shinde, who won the award for Best Editing. The film also won three awards at the 1976 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards (Hindi section): \\"Best Actor in Supporting Role\\" for Amjad Khan, \\"Best Cinematographer (Colour)\\" for Dwarka Divecha, and \\"Best Art Director\\" for Ram Yedekar. Sholay received a special award at the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005: Best Film of 50 Years.  Legacy  Sholay has received many \\"Best Film\\" honours. It was declared the \\"Film of the Millennium\\" by BBC India in 1999. It topped the British Film Institute's \\"Top 10 Indian Films\\" of all time poll of 2002, and was voted the greatest Indian movie in a Sky Digital poll of one million British Indians in 2004. It was also included in Time Magazines \\"Best of Bollywood\\" list in 2010, and in CNN-IBN's list of the \\"100 greatest Indian films of all time\\" in 2013. Sholay inspired many films and pastiches, and spawned a genre of films, the \\"Curry Western\\", which is a play on the term Spaghetti Western. A more accurate label for the genre is the Dacoit Western, due to its roots in earlier Indian dacoit films such as Mother India (1957) and Gunga Jumna (1961). It was also an early and most definitive masala film, and a trend-setter for \\"multi-star\\" films. The film was a watershed for Bollywood's scriptwriters, who were not paid well before Sholay; after the film's success, its writing duo Salim-Javed became stars in their own right and script writing became a more respected profession. The BBC has described Sholay as the \\"Star Wars of Bollywood\\", comparing its impact on Bollywood to the impact that Star Wars (1977) later had on Hollywood, while comparing Gabbar Singh to Darth Vader. A line of Gabbar Singh (Tera kya hoga, meaning, \\"What will happen to you?\\") and a picture of him is painted on the back of an alt=A dialogue and image of Gabbar Singh painted on the back of an auto rickshaw Certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in India, such as \\"Kitne aadmi the\\" (How many men were there?), \\"Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya\\" (One who is scared is dead), and \\"Bahut yaarana laagta hai\\" (Looks like you two are very close) ‚Äì all dialogues of Gabbar Singh. These and other popular dialogues entered the people's daily vernacular. Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture. Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by \\"seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains\\", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of Shaan (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of Mr. India (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of Tridev (1989). Filmfare, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, and four actors were included in its 2010 list of \\"80 Iconic Performances\\" for their work in this film. The film is often credited with making Amitabh Bachchan a \\"superstar\\", two years after he became a star with Zanjeer (1973). Some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in Sholay; for example, Mac Mohan continued to be referred to as \\"Sambha\\", even though his character had just one line. Major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials, promos, films and sitcoms. Amjad Khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career. He also played Gabbar Singh again in the 1991 spoof Ramgarh Ke Sholay, and reprised the role in commercials. The British Film Institute in 2002 wrote that fear of Gabbar Singh \\"is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep\\". The 2012 film Gabbar Singh, named after the character, became the highest grossing Telugu film up to that point. Comedian Jagdeep, who played Soorma Bhopali in the film, attempted to use his Sholay success to create a spinoff. He directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film Soorma Bhopali, in which Dharmendra and Bachchan had cameos. In 2004, Sholay was digitally remastered and shown again to packed theatres in India, including Mumbai's Minerva, where it had run successfully 29 years earlier. An attempt to remake Sholay, Ram Gopal Varma's film Aag (2007), starring Amitabh Bachchan as the villain, was a commercial and critical disaster. Because of television and home media, Sholay is widely available and still popular. Twenty years after its release, Sholay was first shown on the Indian DD National television channel, where it drew the highest ratings ever for an Indian film broadcast. Video game producer Mobile2win released the \\"Sholay Ramgarh Express\\" game for mobile phones in 2004, along with other Sholay themed content such as wallpapers, video clips, and ringtones. In 2019, a film titled The Sholay Girl, based on the stunt woman Reshma Pathan, was released. Pathan had worked as the body double for Malini in the film. Sholay has been the subject of two books and many articles. Wimal Dissanayake and Malti Sahai's Sholay, A Cultural Reading (1992) attempts a comprehensive scholarly study that sets the film within the broader history of popular cinema in India. Anupama Chopra's Sholay: The Making of a Classic (2000) provides an inside look at the film's production based on interviews with the director, stars, and crew members. Sholay has been labelled by Chopra as the gold standard in Indian cinema, and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts. Over the years, the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture, and has been called the greatest Hindi film of all time. It belongs to only a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), which are repeatedly watched throughout India, and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. The lasting effect of Sholay on Indian cinema was summarised by Anupama Chopra, when in 2004 she called it \\"no longer just a film, [but] an event\\". In the 2000 book Sholay: The Making of a Classic, the noted director Shekhar Kapur stated \\"there has never been a more defining film on the Indian screen. Indian film history can be divided into Sholay BC and Sholay AD\\". The film was jointly released in Pakistan by Geo films and Mandviwalla Entertainment on 17 April 2015, almost 40 years after its theatrical release. The film's premiere in the country was held in Karachi.  3D re-release  Filmmaker Ketan Mehta's company Maya Digital was responsible for converting Sholay into the 3D format. Mehta was approached by G. P. Sippy's grandson, Sasha Sippy, about the project in 2010. In March 2012, Shaan Uttam Singh, the grandson of producer G. P. Sippy, said that he would sponsor a conversion of the film to 3D, and release it in late 2012; this was later postponed to late 2013, and eventually finalised for 3 January 2014. It took to convert Sholay to 3D. Under the leadership of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter in the direction of the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves. The theatrical trailer and release date were unveiled by the original script-writers Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. The two original leads, Bachchan and Dharmendra, were also involved in promoting the re- release. The film was released in 1,000 screens in India, and additional screens overseas. It earned approximately during its re-release, not enough to recover its conversion cost.

Quillen College of Medicine which is often ranked as one of the top schools in the United States for rural medicine and primary care education; the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy, the College of Nursing, the College of Public Health, and the recently formed College of Clinical and Rehabilitative Health Sciences. Unique programs include an accredited program in Bluegrass, Old Time, and Country Music, America's lone master's degree in Storytelling, and the Appalachian Studies programs, focused on the surrounding Appalachian region. History Dossett HallETSU was founded as East Tennessee State Normal School in 1911 to educate teachers; the K-12 training school, called University School, operates to this day. East Tennessee State officially became a college in 1925 when it changed its name to East Tennessee State Teachers College, subsequently gaining accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1927. By 1930, the school's name had changed again to East Tennessee State Teacher's College, Johnson City. In 1943, East Tennessee State Teacher's College was expanded into a college with a range of liberal arts offerings, becoming East Tennessee State College. The college became East Tennessee State University in 1963, adopting the name it holds today. In 1973, Shelbridge became the president's official residence. With ETSU announced plans to open a College of Pharmacy in 2005, rapidly receiving local support to secure the approval. Full accreditation was granted in June 2010, shortly after the first class of the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy graduated.ETSU pharmacy school accredited In December 2007, the College of Public and Allied Health split into two new colleges, the College of Public Health and the College of Clinical and Rehabilitative Health Sciences. Both are part of ETSU's Health Sciences Division, which also includes the James H. Quillen College of Medicine, the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy, and the College of Nursing. In late 2009, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Board of Regents authorized the formation of a Ph.D program in Sport Physiology and Performance. This program, the first of its kind in the United States, focuses on sports science and physiology in athletics. It features concentrations in sport physiology and sport performance and started in 2010. Presidents *Sidney G. Gilbreath, 1911‚Äì1925 *Charles C. Sherrod, 1925‚Äì1949 *Burgin E.

ETSU strongly supports and encourages faculty and student research. In FY12, ETSU was awarded over $50 million in research, public service, and training/instruction grants. The ETSU Office of Research and Sponsored Programs Administration (ORSPA) organizes an annual event, the Appalachian Student Research Forum, for students to showcase their research via poster and/or oral presentations. At the April 2012 event, over 150 student poster and oral presentations were made and over $5000 was given in prize money to undergraduate, graduate, medical students, medical residents and postdoctoral fellows. Athletics East Tennessee State athletics logo ETSU collegiate athletic teams, nicknamed Buccaneers, compete in the NCAA Division I Southern Conference. The Buccaneers rejoined the Southern Conference in July 2014 after competing in the Atlantic Sun since 2003, when they dropped football. In the 2006-07 year, ETSU won both the conference's men and women's All-Sport trophies, winning seven team titles. They repeated as the overall and men's All-Sport champions in 2007-08 with three team titles, in 2008-09 with five team titles, and in 2009-10 with three team titles. ETSU has won the Bill Bibb Trophy for the best overall Atlantic Sun athletic program all six years since it was first awarded for the 2006-07 season. Current men's sports at ETSU are football, baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track and field. Women's sports are basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field and volleyball. Men's soccer competed at the club level in the fall of 2007, before entering NCAA and Atlantic Sun competition as a scholarship program in the 2008 season. A new on-campus soccer field, Summers-Taylor Stadium, opened in fall 2007. In the 2007-08 season, the women's basketball team made their first trip to the NCAA tournament. In 2009 and 2010, both the men's and women's teams earned automatic berths to the NCAA championship by winning the Atlantic Sun Conference tournaments. In May 2013, the ETSU Baseball team won their first ASUN Conference Championship and their second NCAA Regional berth. Kerry Doane received the Conference pitcher of the year award. He was drafted in the 24th round by the Cleveland Indians. In May 2014, ETSU Pitcher and 1st baseman, Clinton Freeman was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. On January 29, 2013, the Student Government Association voted 22-5 for a $125 per semester fee increase that would fund the reinstatement of the football program. University President Dr. Brian Noland, who was in attendance for the vote, said that fee would be sufficient to support football and Title IX requirements that support additional women's athletics. Noland told the student senators a team could be on the field by fall 2015, if the Tennessee Board of Regents approved the proposal. ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center, also known as the Mini Dome On March 29, 2013, the TBR approved the $125 fee increase to reinstate football at ETSU. Dr. Noland and Athletic Director Dr. Sander hired former UNC head football coach, Carl Torbush to lead the restart of football in Johnson City, TN. Coach Torbush signed his first class in February 2014. As President Noland predicted, ETSU football began again in the fall of 2015 football season playing home games on the campus of Science Hill High School. In the fall of 2017, the William B. Greene Jr. Stadium became the new home for ETSU Football. With of the addition of football, ETSU rejoined the Southern Conference in 2014 because the A-Sun does not support the sport. The Mini-Dome (lovingly nicknamed 'Half- Astrodome') on the campus of ETSU houses the intercollegiate athletics offices. Still known by students, faculty, and the community as the Mini-Dome, this campus landmark has been officially renamed from Memorial Center to the ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center. The largest building on the ETSU campus, it hosts several indoor track and field meets, and was once the home field for the university's football program. The Mini-Dome has hosted many non-athletic events that could not be housed in an indoor setting on most American college campuses, such as national indoor championships for free flight model aircraft. Greek life There are several Greek organizations offered at East Tennessee State University. Greek life provides occasions for social interaction and intramural participation between young men and women. The Interfraternity Council offers young men eight fraternities: Beta Upsilon Chi Sigma Beta Rho, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Pi Kappa Alpha. The Pan-Hellenic Council offers young women five sororities: Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Xi Delta, Kappa Delta, and Sigma Kappa. The National Pan-Hellenic Council offers five fraternities and sororities: Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Omega Psi Phi, Phi Beta Sigma, and Zeta Phi Beta. Five percent of both men and women on campus are involved in Greek organizations! Campus life Spring morning in the center of campus In April 2002, the Basler Center for Physical Activity (BCPA) was opened. The building contains recreational facilities such as an indoor climbing wall, walking / jogging track, racquetball / basketball courts, an indoor swimming pool, meeting rooms and a weight room. The Basler Center also offers a diverse selection of fitness classes from yoga to martial arts. ETSU Campus Recreation completed an expansion of the BCPA in 2013 and also opened the Campus Recreation Field Complex. The BCPA expansion included a volleyball / indoor soccer/basketball court, a martial arts studio, a yoga studio, a change room, an extra 4,000 square foot area for the weight room, and a cycling studio. Autumn afternoon on the ETSU medical campus looking toward the main campus The Campus Recreation Field Complex includes Field 1- a multi-use field designed for softball and flag football and Field 2- a natural grass multi-use field designed for softball but can also accommodate flag football, soccer and other sports.

It covers parts of the municipalities of Itatiaia and Resende in Rio de Janeiro state, and Bocaina de Minas and Itamonte in Minas Gerais state. It is mountainous and rocky with altitudes ranging from . The highest point is the Black Needles peak (Pico das Agulhas Negras). The higher part of the park contains the origins of 12 river basins that supply the Rio Grande (Grand River), a tributary of the Paran√° River, and the Para√≠ba do Sul, the most important river in Rio de Janeiro state. The lower part of the park has lush Atlantic Forest vegetation and wide rivers with natural pools and waterfalls. The Pico das Agulhas Negras is the state' third highest mountain at .

Luigi Lanzi (14 June 1732 - 30 March 1810) was an Italian art historian and archaeologist. When he died he was buried in the church of the Santa Croce at Florence by the side of Michelangelo. Biography Born in Treia, Lanzi was educated as a priest. He entered the Order of the Jesuits, resided at Rome and in 1773 was appointed keeper of the galleries of Florence, where he became president of the Accademia della Crusca. He thereafter studied Italian painting and Etruscan antiquities and language. In the one field his labors are represented by his Storia Pittorica dell' Italia, the first portion of which, containing the Florentine, Sienese, Roman and Neapolitan schools, appeared in 1792, the rest in 1796. In archaeology his great achievement was Saggio di lingua Etrusca (1789), followed by Saggio delle lingue d' Italia in 1806. In his 1806 memoir on the so-called Etruscan vases Dei vasi antichi dipinti volgarmente chiamati Etruschi, Lanzi rightly perceived their Greek origin and characters. What was true of the antiquities would be true also, he argued, of the Etruscan language, and the object of the Saggio di lingua Etrusca was to prove that this language must be related to that of the neighboring peoples: Romans, Umbrians, Oscans and Greeks. He was allied with Ennio Quirino Visconti in his great but never accomplished plan of illustrating antiquity altogether from existing literature and monuments. His notices of ancient sculpture and its various styles appeared as an appendix to the Saggio di lingua Etrusca, and arose out of his minute study of the treasures then added to the Florentine collection from the Villa Medici. The abuse he met with from later writers on the Etruscan language led Corssen to protest in the name of his real services to philology and archaeology. Among his other productions was an edition of Hesiod's Works and Days, with valuable notes, and a translation in terza rima. Begun in 1785, it was recast and completed in 1808. The list of his works closes with his Opere sacre, a series of treatises on spiritual subjects. References *Elogio dell' abate L.

He was best known for his longstanding work with the media, most notably his wry and gentle sense of humour on Thought for the Day on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was the first British rabbi publicly to declare his homosexuality. Career Blue was born in the East End of London in 1930. His parents were Jews of Russian origin and his father worked as a tailor. Blue did not receive a religious education, declaring that he lost his religious faith at the age of five after a petitionary prayer failed to remove Adolf Hitler and Oswald Mosley. Instead, Blue became interested in Marxism. He entered Hendon County School at sixth form level, following education in the East End and a year out of school at age 16‚Äì17. He served in the British Army but was discharged after suffering a nervous breakdown brought on by anxiety over his closet homosexuality. Blue read History at Balliol College, Oxford and Semitics at University College London. He regained his faith while at Oxford, when he found some resolution to severe personal conflicts regarding his sexual orientation at a Quaker meeting. He also found Victor Gollancz's A Year of Grace helpful during this time, and finally became one of the first two students at Leo Baeck College for training rabbis in 1956.Blue, Lionel (2010) The Godseeker's Guide pps.15, 36 ‚Äì 40 & 136, Continuum International Publishing Group, Our History ‚Äì Rabbi Leigh Edgware & District Reform Synagogue Blue was ordained as a rabbi in 1960. Between 1960 and 1963, Blue was the minister of the Settlement Synagogue and Middlesex New Synagogue. He then became the European Director of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. In 1967, he began a long-term engagement as a lecturer at Leo Baeck College in London. He lived in Finchley, north London. Blue made his first radio broadcast in 1967 and was a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme for 25 years. He made numerous appearances on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 2 and produced a television programme, entitled In Search of Holy England, in 1989. In 2006, a return trip to his childhood home in London's East End to mark the 350th anniversary of Jewish life in Britain was the subject of an evocative audioslideshow on the BBC News website. Blue was awarded honorary doctorates from the Open University and Grey College, Durham. In 1994, he was appointed to an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

He was involved with various gay charities, including the Jewish Gay and Lesbian Group, and Kairos in Soho. Illnesses and death Blue was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 57; however, he successfully controlled his disorder with medication. During an operation in 1997, a surgeon discovered a tumour which tests proved to be malignant. He received radiotherapy and hormonal treatment to reduce any further growth.

Best known for being a founding member of the rock band Styx as primary lead vocalist and keyboardist, a tenure that lasted from 1970 until June 1999. DeYoung has been credited as the writer of more Styx songs than any other Styx member. He was also the band's most successful writer, penning 7 of the band's 8 Billboard top 10 singles as well as a solo top 10 single. Early life Dennis DeYoung was born on February 18, 1947 in Chicago, Illinois to parents Maurice and Loraine DeYoung. Growing up in the Roseland area of Chicago, DeYoung started his career as a vocalist in 1962 at the age of 15 when he teamed up with his 13-year-old neighbors Chuck and John Panozzo in a three-piece combo. The trio later added guitarist James Young and John Curulewski to form the band Tradewinds in the late 1960s. The band renamed itself TW4 in 1968 before becoming Styx in 1972. Before the band met with success, DeYoung spent time as an elementary school teacher in the southern suburbs of Chicago, where he taught music at a variety of schools. During this period, the band played a number of small venues and school auditoriums, refining their craft before the song \\"Lady\\" propelled them to national, then international, stardom. DeYoung met his high school sweetheart Suzanne when he was seventeen and she was fifteen. They married in 1970. Tenure with Styx (1970‚Äì1984) Within Styx, DeYoung acted as lead vocalist, keyboardist, accordion player, producer and songwriter. From the start of Styx's commercial success with the 1973 DeYoung-penned single \\"Lady\\", DeYoung became the creative force behind most of the band's hit songs. DeYoung wrote and sang lead on seven of the band's eight top 10 Billboard Hot 100-ranked hits during this period, with Tommy Shaw's \\"Too Much Time on My Hands\\" (#9) being the sole exception. The seven DeYoung penned-and-performed top 10 Billboard hits, in order of their peak chart placement are: * \\"Babe\\", the band's only #1 hit to date * \\"Mr. Roboto\\" (#3) * \\"Show Me the Way\\" (#3) * \\"The Best of Times\\" (#3) * \\"Don't Let It End\\" (#6) * \\"Lady\\", the band's 1973 breakthrough hit (#6 in March 1975) * \\"Come Sail Away\\" (#8) A self-taught keyboardist, DeYoung quickly became one of the most notable keyboard players in rock. Featured on the cover of the January 1981 issue of Contemporary Keyboard magazine (a story that was reprinted in Contemporary Keyboard's book on the greatest rock keyboardists), DeYoung described many of his steps along the way through his keyboard-playing career: He'd never played an acoustic piano until the recording session for 1973's \\"Lady\\"; he recorded the track for 1979's \\"Babe\\" in a friend's basement on a Rhodes electric piano he'd never touched before; the odd feeling of switching back to playing accordion for the song \\"Boat on the River\\" and discovering how small the keys felt to his fingers after years of playing electric organs and pianos.Text from article in Contemporary Keyboard, January 1981 As a keyboardist in Styx, DeYoung was best remembered for his prominent lead synthesizer solos performed on the Oberheim 4 voice synthesizer that dominated the mix with a unique tone, a key element of the Styx sound. Influenced by the recent release of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's first album, DeYoung ‚Äì a novice synthesizer player at the time ‚Äì used a modular Moog to record the keyboard tracks for Styx's debut album in 1972. This album featured a rock version of \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\", more than 5 years before ELP came up with a similar idea of recording this classical composition as a rock band featuring the synthesizer that would later become one of ELP's best known recordings. DeYoung's songs often had a grandiose style to them in the tradition of 1970s theatrical rock, which heavily influenced the group's direction in the late 1970s, culminating in the concept albums Paradise Theatre (1981) and Kilroy Was Here (1983). The dissent of some members in the band during Kilroy brought tensions between the group's members over the future direction of the band, leading to guitarist Tommy Shaw's departure in 1984. Early solo career (1984‚Äì1989) With Styx in limbo following Shaw's 1984 departure, DeYoung began a solo career of modest success. His first solo album, Desert Moon (1984), generated a top 10 hit, \\"Desert Moon\\", and the follow-up single, \\"Don't Wait for Heroes\\", cracked the Billboard Top 100 as well. The Desert Moon album was certified gold in Canada in 1984. To date, \\"Desert Moon\\" is the only solo single by any Styx member to hit the Billboard Top 10. DeYoung's solo career continued with Back to the World (1986), which contained the singles \\"Call Me\\" and \\"This Is the Time\\" which was featured in the soundtrack of Karate Kid II (1986) movie. His third solo album Boomchild (1988) failed to have a hit single, though the video for \\"Boomchild\\" received a fair amount of music video airplay. After a five-year hiatus; DeYoung and several other members of Styx began discussing a possible reunion in 1989. By December 1989 Styx had unofficially reformed. Tommy Shaw, who joined Damn Yankees in 1988, did not return. Reuniting with Styx (1990‚Äì1992) In 1990, Styx (minus Tommy Shaw, who was replaced by guitarist/singer-songwriter Glen Burtnik) returned to the studio for the album Edge of the Century (1990). \\"Show Me the Way\\", a track written by DeYoung for his son Matthew, received extensive radio play, peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart (Styx's 8th top 10 single, and 7th written and sung by DeYoung) particularly after a number of radio stations mixed it with voice tracks of parents headed off to fight in the first Persian Gulf War. This put the group in an exclusive group as one of only a few bands to have a top ten hit single under four different United States Presidents. The group toured extensively before A&M; Records (which had just merged with PolyGram Records) dropped the group from its roster in 1992; the group broke up again shortly afterwards. Venture into acting (1993‚Äì1995) Between stints with Styx, DeYoung, a Roman Catholic, joined a touring revival of the stage musical Jesus Christ Superstar in 1993, appearing in about 200 performances as Pontius Pilate. The experience inspired him to record his 1994 album of Broadway standards, 10 on Broadway, and to begin work on a musical of his own based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (French Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831). Reuniting with Styx (1995‚Äì1999) \\"Lady '95\\" (1995) In 1987, A&M; Records had released the compilation album Styx - Classics, Volume 15, but since A&M; did not own the rights to the original recording of \\"Lady\\" (which had been released by Wooden Nickel Records through a distribution deal with RCA Records), the track could not be included on the disc. In 1995, Styx reunited, this time with Shaw, but without a terminally ill John Panozzo, who had developed cirrhosis following years of chronic alcoholism. The band recorded a new version of \\"Lady\\", which became the lead track (\\"Lady '95\\") of a new compilation album, Styx Greatest Hits, for A&M.; Todd Sucherman (uncredited) provided the drum track for the recording session. Panozzo died of gastrointestinal bleeding on July 16, 1996. Sucherman took his place, and in 1996, Styx toured for the first time in four years. \\"Return to Paradise\\" tour (1996‚Äì1997) Styx's 1996 tour, dubbed the \\"Return to Paradise\\" tour by the band, proved remarkably successful, and a 2-disc live recording of the show (with three new studio tracks) proved even more so; 1997's Return to Paradise live album went gold and spawned a top-30 hit on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, the DeYoung-penned \\"Paradise\\". With the positive response and a new record label (CMC International), Styx returned to the studio in 1998 and began work on their first studio album in eight years. Departure from Styx (1999) Though DeYoung and his bandmates had been able to put aside their musical and personal differences during the \\"Return to Paradise\\" tour, those same issues resurfaced once work started on their new album, Brave New World. Complicating matters, DeYoung's physical health took a sudden turn for the worse; DeYoung said he was afflicted with a chronic fatigue syndrome-like disorder that affected his trigeminal nerve, and that he would not be able to perform onstage due to a sensitivity to bright light and sound caused by this disorder. The other four members of Styx said that the band was contractually obliged to tour in support of the Brave New World album. When DeYoung reiterated his health issues made him unable to perform live, the other members of the band opted to replace DeYoung with Canadian star Lawrence Gowan in 1999 in order to fulfill their touring obligation. DeYoung sued his former bandmates, seeking the rights to use the group's name in support of his solo career. The suit was settled in 2001, with the group being allowed to keep the name \\"Styx\\" and DeYoung able to use the name in descriptive phrases such as \\"the music of Styx\\" or \\"formerly of Styx\\" (but not \\"the voice of Styx\\"). Styx has consistently maintained that any chance of a reunion with DeYoung is unlikely. When asked about any possible reunions with DeYoung, James Young of Styx commented on an edition of VH1's Behind the Music television series, \\"Maybe when they are playing hockey on the river Styx. And maybe not even then.\\" Young also addressed the reunion issue on an episode of VH1's Feuds 2000, noting the possibility of a reunion would only happen \\"[as] the Eagles said, 'when Hell freezes over'.\\" Bassist Chuck Panozzo, no longer actively touring with Styx due to health issues associated with his HIV-positive status, offered a more hopeful tone to a writer doing a story on the band for tampabay.com; while reflecting on the effect the loss of his fraternal twin brother, John, had on the band, Panozzo noted, \\"Before any more of us die, I would hope that it could happen. Every year that it doesn't happen is another year that goes by. And if you wait too long, who will care?\\" But in an interview Tommy Shaw gave Rolling Stone in 2011 indicated that he didn't think a reunion was realistic, noting, \\"We're crazy, but we're not insane.\\" Post- Styx career Dennis DeYoung performing in 2010 In February 2000, DeYoung was approached to perform a concert featuring his many songs from Styx, as well as his solo works and his 1997 stage musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame, with an orchestra. The show, performed at the Rosemont Theatre near DeYoung's hometown of Chicago, was a family affair for DeYoung. His wife Suzanne and sister-in- law Dawn Marie Feusi sang backup, his daughter Carrie Ann was in charge of publicity, while his son Matthew designed the stage lighting. The concert was well received and formed the basis for a touring version of the show, and eventually a 2004 live album, The Music of Styx - Live with Symphony Orchestra. Healthy once again, DeYoung returned to touring with a 50-piece orchestra augmented by a five-piece rock band, which included Tommy Dziallo on guitar, Hank Horton on bass, and Kyle Woodring (from John Mellencamp and Deana Carter) on drums, all of whom also played shows with DeYoung with or without the orchestra. DeYoung made his major motion picture debut in 2005's The Perfect Man, in which he played the lead vocalist in a Styx tribute band. In August 2006, DeYoung appeared along with Supertramp's Roger Hodgson on Canadian Idol, where he performed with and mentored the contestants. On April 20, 2006, at the Community Theatre in Morristown, New Jersey, DeYoung took to the stage once again with former Styx guitarist and bassist Glen Burtnik as part of his Lost Treasures concert series. It marked the first time in nearly seven years that the two had appeared together. On his website, DeYoung jokingly dubbed the performances \\"The Denny and Glenny Show\\". While on stage, the duo opened with the Beatles classic \\"We Can Work It Out\\" and also performed \\"Watching the World Go by\\", and \\"All for Love\\", songs that were originally written for the unreleased Edge of the Century 2 Styx album. On September 14 and 15, 2006, DeYoung appeared with Hal Sparks on Celebrity Duets, an American reality television show produced by Simon Cowell. They sang Styx songs \\"Come Sail Away\\" and \\"Mr. Roboto\\". DeYoung was invited back to perform on Celebrity Duets on September 28, 2006, with finalist Hal Sparks. The pair performed the Styx breakthrough hit \\"Lady\\", written by DeYoung in 1973, with DeYoung serenading his wife Suzanne in the audience while Hal did the same for his long-time girlfriend. In 2007, DEP Records of Canada released DeYoung's stateside 2004 live CD Dennis DeYoung and the Music of Styx Live with Symphony Orchestra, which went on to achieve platinum status.Platinum Status (In Canada 50,000 plus copies sold for a double CD qualifies as platinum.) They also released his DVD The Rock: Symphonic Music of Styx, which went triple platinum.Triple Platinum Status In addition, he appeared on the Canadian reality TV series Star Acad√©mie. On June 19, 2007, DeYoung released in Canada his fifth solo album, One Hundred Years from Now, marking a return to his rock roots. The first single, the title track, was a duet with Qu√©b√©cois singer √âric Lapointe. The single reached number 1 on the Qu√©bec Radio Single and Soundscan charts. The album was released in the U.S. on April 14, 2009, with slightly different tracks. One song \\"I Believe In You\\" received some airplay on Sirius XM and some local radio stations. On New Year's Eve 2007, he performed \\"Mr. Roboto\\", \\"Come Sail Away\\" and many other Styx classics to a large audience at Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Canada, and millions of viewers via live television on CHCH-TV Channel 11. Following his concert, he did a brief live interview with CHCH-TV's Mat Hayes. On May 8, 2008, DeYoung's musical version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame premiered at the Bailiwick Repertory Theatre in Chicago.Bailiwick Repository Theatre Official Site This production went on to win the Joseph Jefferson Award for best musical in Chicago in 2008.Joseph Jefferson Awards On September 20, 2008, DeYoung performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame benefit concert for the John Entwistle foundation. The benefit concert was held at the Koka Booth Amphitheatre in Cary, North Carolina, and featured many other rock and roll musicians. He and his band performed many of Styx's hits. 2014 Eat to the Beat Concert Series, part of the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival, in Walt Disney World In November and December 2008, DeYoung was a featured artist on the German Night of the Proms 20-city tour. He joined Robin Gibb, Tears for Fears, 10CC and Kim Wilde on the sold-out tour. He also accompanied Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees on piano performing \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\". On July 12, 2009, DeYoung was honored by his native city Chicago with the \\"Great Performer of Illinois Award\\".Great Performers of Illinois Official Site Following the award ceremony in the Frank Gehry-designed Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park in Chicago, DeYoung and his band performed many of Styx's hits in a free concert. On October 13, 2009, DeYoung's sound creation dubbed the \\"ARF 2600\\" (from ARP 2600) was given its world premiere at the opening of The 101 Dalmatians Musical in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2010, DeYoung formed a new band to capture the sound and look of the original Styx band, dedicated to the music of Styx, adding a Tommy Shaw look-alike and sound-alike guitarist and lead vocalist August Zadra and bassist-vocalist Craig Carter to join John Blasucci, James Young look-alike guitarist Jimmy Leahey, Tom Sharpe, and wife Suzanne DeYoung in performing Styx hits \\"Renegade\\", \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and others as well as DeYoung's solo works. The current band members have been lauded for their talents in their own right. On October 21, 2014, a 2CD + DVD and Blu-ray package, Dennis DeYoung... And the Music of Styx Live in Los Angeles, was released in the U.S. via Frontiers Records. The European release date was October 17, 2014.http://www.frontiers.it/album/5223/ Also on October 21, 2014, a condensed version of this live concert package was broadcast on AXS TV Headliner Club Concert Series.http://www.axs.tv/headliner-club/dennis- deyoung/ The concert took place at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California on March 18, 2014.http://www.theelrey.com/events/detail/248271 On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Dennis DeYoung among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He published topographical illustrations Troy and the surrounding area in 1804. He also published illustrations showing the results of archaeological digs at Pompeii. His best-known work is Pompeiana; the Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii, published between 1817 and 1832. Early Years and Education Born at Hopton in Derbyshire, the son of Philip Gell and Dorothy Milnes (daughter and coheir of William Milnes of Aldercar Park). The Gell family was one of the oldest families in England with a tradition of service in the Army, Navy, Parliament and the Church going back to 1209, in the reign of King John. His great grandfather was the parliamentarian Sir John Gell and his uncle was Admiral John Gell.Gell of Hopton Hall, Rotherham web, accessed 4 October 2008 Gell was educated at Derby School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He matriculated there in 1793, took a BA degree in 1798 and an MA in 1804, and was elected a fellow of Emmanuel.Wroth, W. W. & Thompson, J. ‚Äì Gell, Sir William (1777‚Äì1836), classical archaeologist and traveller in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004)  The Topography of Troy, and its Vicinity  In 1801, at the age of 24, Gell was sent on his first diplomatic mission to Greece. From 1804 to 1806 he travelled in Greece, the neighbouring islands, and coastal Asia Minor. In 1804 he fixed the site of Troy at Bournabashi, some distance south‚Äîapproximately six miles or nine-and-a-half kilometres directly, eight miles or thirteen kilometres by modern roads ‚Äì of the modern consensus site at Hisarlik. He cited Jean Baptiste LeChevalier \\"and others\\" as his sources for the idea, which his own observations seemed to him to confirm, although he pointed out what he considered unresolved problems.William Gell, The Topography of Troy, and its Vicinity: Illustrated & Explained by Drawings & Descriptions,\\" (Longman: London, 1804), pp.36 & 47 He published The Topography of Troy and its vicinity illustrated and explained by drawings and descriptions etc. in 1804. Lord Byron mentions him in his work 'English Bards' thus:  Publications  William Gell was a great friend of Thomas Moore, Walter Scott and Lord Byron. He wrote many books, most of them illustrated with his own sketches. He was in 1807 elected a Member of the Society of Dilettanti and a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1811 the Society of Dilettanti commissioned him to explore Greece and Asia Minor. These travels resulted in several publications, e.g. Geography and Antiquities of Ithaca and Itinerary of Greece, with a Commentary on Pausanias and Strabo. With these publications he achieved fame in the scholarly circles as a classical topographer. He went with Princess (afterwards Queen) Caroline to Italy in 1814 as one of her chamberlains. He gave evidence in her favour on 6 October 1820, at her trial before the House of Lords, stating that he had left her service merely on account of a fit of the gout and had seen no impropriety between her and her courtier Bergami. However, in letters of 1815 and 1816, written under such pseudonyms as 'Blue Beard', 'Adonis' and 'Gellius', he related bits of scandal about the Queen. He was Knighted on 11 May 1814. Gell was a close friend of Keppel Richard Craven and travelled around Italy with him.  Later Years  From 1820 until his death, he resided in Rome, where he painted. He had another house in Naples, where he received visitors including his particular friends Sir William Drummond, the Hon. Keppel Craven, John Auldjo, Lady Blessington and Sir Walter Scott. Although crippled by gout, Sir William took Scott to Pompeii and showed him around the excavations. After Scott's death, Sir William drew up an account of their conversations in Naples, part of which is printed in Lockhart's 'Life of Scott'. It was then that he published some of his best known archaeological work including Pompeiana and The Topography of Troy. Gell died at Naples in 1836 and was buried in the English Cemetery, Naples. On his death he left all his personal belongings to Craven.  Legacy  His numerous drawings of classical ruins and localities, executed with great detail and exactness, are preserved in the British Museum. Gell was a thorough dilettante, fond of society and possessed of little real scholarship. Nonetheless his topographical works became recognised text-books at a time when Greece and even Italy were but superficially known to English travellers. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries of London, and a member of the Institute of France and the Royal Academy in Berlin. His best-known work is Pompeiana; the Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii, published between 1817 and 1832, in the first part of which he was assisted by J. P. Gandy. It was followed in 1834 by the Topography of Rome and its Vicinity. He wrote also Topography of Troy and its Vicinity (1804); Geography and Antiquities of Ithaca (1807); Itinerary of Greece, with a Commentary on Pausanias and Strabo (1810); and Itinerary of the Morea (1816). Although these works have been superseded by later publications, they continue to provide valuable information for the study of classical topography. He is, together with his friends Edward Dodwell and Keppel Richard Craven, by some modern scholars seen as the founder of the study of the historical topography of the hinterland of Rome.* Wallace-Hadrill, A. -\\"Roman Topography and the Prism of Sir William Gell\\", in Haselberger, L. & J.

A qalam () is a type of pen made from a cut, dried reed, used for Islamic calligraphy. The pen is seen as an important symbol of wisdom in Islam, and references the emphasis on knowledge and education within the Islamic tradition. Etymology The word was borrowed from Greek k√°lamos (Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ, \\"reed\\"), possibly via Ge'ez ·∏≥√§l√§m (, \\"reed\\") mixed into the root of ·∏≥√§l√§m√§ (, \\"to color, to stain, to write\\").  Manufacturing  The stems of hollow reeds are cut at specific angles depending on intended script so that they can be used for calligraphy, and the type of reed used varies depending on the specific calligrapher's preferences. For example, master calligrapher Ja'far Tabrizi preferred the wƒÅ·π£e·π≠i and ƒÅmuyi reeds of eastern Iraq and the Oxus River, respectively. It was desired that the qalam should be roughly twelve to sixteen inches long, and could not be too dry as they needed to be a specific balance of not too sturdy and not too flexible.  Qalam in the Islamic tradition  The concepts of knowledge and writing are very important in Islam, and thus the qalam is revered as a symbol of wisdom and education in the Qur'an; Sura 68 is called Al-Qalam. Even in pre-Islamic societies, writing was widely used for commercial and occasionally legislative purposes. It is a commonly held belief amongst the Muslim population that disrespect of calligraphy as a tradition would reveal a person as being uneducated and unwise. In Islam, the physical presence of the written letters of the Quran functioned the way icons did to the Byzantines, as a blessing and protection. Because of this, Islamic calligraphers often had a high place in society, while their counterparts in regions like Byzantium would only be known to their family and patrons. A Turkish penbox and inkwell that would have been used by calligraphers. Calligraphy holds a central position in the Islamic artistic tradition, and because of this there exist a large variety of accessories to accompany the qalam and its user, such as pen boxes, ink wells, and knives for cutting the reeds. These tools were often very ornamented and cherished objects and reflected countless hours of other artists and craftsmen. The ink used to write with in antiquity was most frequently black or dark brown, and was made from gum arabic, soot, gallnuts, or vitriol. Some Qurans, however, are written entirely in gold, and more contemporary calligraphers may use a wider variety of colors. Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla, a Persian official of the Abbasid caliphate, developed a standardized system of writing calligraphy based on the marks made with the point of a reed pen, in combination with other geometric principles. As far as other aspects of ornamentation go, metallic inks on colored parchment passed from Byzantium to Muslim Spain, and Arabic calligraphy in turn made its way back to Europe.

In the case of geometry over the field of complex numbers, an algebraic surface has complex dimension two (as a complex manifold, when it is non- singular) and so of dimension four as a smooth manifold. The theory of algebraic surfaces is much more complicated than that of algebraic curves (including the compact Riemann surfaces, which are genuine surfaces of (real) dimension two). Many results were obtained, however, in the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and are up to 100 years old.  Classification by the Kodaira dimension  In the case of dimension one varieties are classified by only the topological genus, but dimension two, the difference between the arithmetic genus p_a and the geometric genus p_g turns to be important because we cannot distinguish birationally only the topological genus. Then we introduce the irregularity for the classification of them. A summary of the results (in detail, for each kind of surface refers to each redirection), follows: Examples of algebraic surfaces include (Œ∫ is the Kodaira dimension): * Œ∫ = ‚àí‚àû: the projective plane, quadrics in P3, cubic surfaces, Veronese surface, del Pezzo surfaces, ruled surfaces * Œ∫ = 0 : K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, Enriques surfaces, hyperelliptic surfaces * Œ∫ = 1: elliptic surfaces * Œ∫ = 2: surfaces of general type. For more examples see the list of algebraic surfaces. The first five examples are in fact birationally equivalent. That is, for example, a cubic surface has a function field isomorphic to that of the projective plane, being the rational functions in two indeterminates. The Cartesian product of two curves also provides examples.  Birational geometry of surfaces  The birational geometry of algebraic surfaces is rich, because of blowing up (also known as a monoidal transformation), under which a point is replaced by the curve of all limiting tangent directions coming into it (a projective line). Certain curves may also be blown down, but there is a restriction (self-intersection number must be ‚àí1).  Castelnuovo's Theorem  One of the fundamental theorems for the birational geometry of surfaces is Castelnuovo's theorem. This states that any birational map between algebraic surfaces is given by a finite sequence of blowups and blowdowns.  Properties  The Nakai criterion says that: :A Divisor D on a surface S is ample if and only if D2 > 0 and for all irreducible curve C on S D‚Ä¢C > 0. Ample divisors have a nice property such as it is the pullback of some hyperplane bundle of projective space, whose properties are very well known. Let \\\\mathcal{D}(S) be the abelian group consisting of all the divisors on S. Then due to the intersection theorem :\\\\mathcal{D}(S)\\\\times\\\\mathcal{D}(S)\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{Z}:(X,Y)\\\\mapsto X\\\\cdot Y is viewed as a quadratic form. Let :\\\\mathcal{D}_0(S):={D\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(S)D\\\\cdot X=0,\\\\text{for all } X\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(S)} then \\\\mathcal{D}/\\\\mathcal{D}_0(S):=Num(S) becomes to be a numerical equivalent class group of S and :Num(S)\\\\times Num(S)\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{Z}=(\\\\bar{D},\\\\bar{E})\\\\mapsto D\\\\cdot E also becomes to be a quadratic form on Num(S), where \\\\bar{D} is the image of a divisor D on S. (In the below the image \\\\bar{D} is abbreviated with D.) For an ample bundle H on S the definition :{H}^\\\\perp:={D\\\\in Num(S)D\\\\cdot H=0}. leads the Hodge index theorem of the surface version. :for D\\\\in{{H}^\\\\perpD e0}, D\\\\cdot D < 0, i.e. {H}^\\\\perp is a negative definite quadratic form. This theorem is proved by using the Nakai criterion and the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. For all the divisor in {H}^\\\\perp this theorem is true. This theorem is not only the tool for the research of surfaces but also used for the proof of the Weil conjecture by Deligne because it is true on the algebraically closed field. Basic results on algebraic surfaces include the Hodge index theorem, and the division into five groups of birational equivalence classes called the classification of algebraic surfaces. The general type class, of Kodaira dimension 2, is very large (degree 5 or larger for a non-singular surface in P3 lies in it, for example). There are essential three Hodge number invariants of a surface. Of those, h1,0 was classically called the irregularity and denoted by q; and h2,0 was called the geometric genus pg. The third, h1,1, is not a birational invariant, because blowing up can add whole curves, with classes in H1,1. It is known that Hodge cycles are algebraic, and that algebraic equivalence coincides with homological equivalence, so that h1,1 is an upper bound for œÅ, the rank of the N√©ron- Severi group. The arithmetic genus pa is the difference :geometric genus ‚àí irregularity. In fact this explains why the irregularity got its name, as a kind of 'error term'.  Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces  The Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces was first formulated by Max Noether. The families of curves on surfaces can be classified, in a sense, and give rise to much of their interesting geometry.

Biography Nachman Syrkin Nachum Syrkin was born in Mogilev, Russian Empire (now Belarus). He was influenced by Hovevei Zion and socialism in his youth and dedicated himself to synthesizing the two concepts. In this task he was joined by Ber Borochov. Syrkin's daughter Marie was a noted writer, educator and American Zionist activist.\\"Marie Syrkin (1899 - 1989)\\" Zionist career Syrkin was one of the leaders of the socialist Zionist faction at the First Zionist Congress in 1897 and was an early proponent of the Jewish National Fund. He was also the first person to propose that olim to Palestine form collective settlements. Unlike other socialist thinkers of the time, Syrkin was comfortable with his Jewish heritage and, although he does not spell it out explicitly in his essay \\"The Jewish Question and the Jewish Socialist State\\" (1898), it is clear that he had in mind the biblical emphasis on strict social justice, irrespective of wealth, power or privilege. However, he saw Zionism as a replacement for traditional Judaism: > The new, Zionist Judaism stands in complete contrast to the Judaism of exile > ‚Ä¶ Zionism uproots religious Judaism in a stronger way than Reform or > assimilation, by creating new standards of 'Judaism' which will constitute a > new ideology that can be elevated to the status of a religion. Syrkin worked to establish socialist Zionist groups throughout Central Europe. After studying and working in Germany and France and after being banned from Germany in 1904, Syrkin returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1905. He took part at the 1905 Basle Seventh Zionist Congress as a delegate of the new Zionist Socialist Workers Party. Syrkin was not always convinced the Jewish state had to be located in Palestine: for a few years after the Seventh Zionist Congress (1905) Syrkin quit the Zionist Organization and headed the Russian socialist wing of the Territorialist movement, which regarded Palestine as only one of several possible sites for Jewish settlement and autonomy. In 1907 he moved to the United States. By 1909, he had returned to the Palestine-oriented Zionist mainstream by joining Poale Zion (Po‚Äòalei Tziyon, ‚ÄúWorkers of Zion‚Äù) in America, the strongest socialist-Zionist tendency within the Zionist movement,Comrades and Enemies - Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine, 1906‚Äì1948 by Zachary Lockman and became one of its leaders. In 1919, Syrkin was a member of the American Jewish delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. He was also a leading figure in the World Poale Zion conference that year and was given the task of visiting Palestine to develop a plan for kibbutz settlement. He intended to relocate to Palestine, but died of a heart attack in 1924 in New York City. Legacy In 1951 his mortal remains were buried in the Kibbutz Kinneret beside the other founders of Labour Zionism. Kfar Sirkin, founded in 1933 close to Petach Tikva, is named for him.

The term was originally coined by Michael Southworth, and popularised by R. Murray Schafer. There is a varied history of the use of soundscape depending on discipline, ranging from urban design to wildlife ecology to computer science. An important distinction is to separate soundscape from the broader acoustic environment. The acoustic environment is the combination of all the acoustic resources, natural and artificial, within a given area as modified by the environment. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standardized these definitions in 2014.(ISO 12913-1:2014) A soundscape is a sound or combination of sounds that forms or arises from an immersive environment. The study of soundscape is the subject of acoustic ecology or soundscape ecology. The idea of soundscape refers to both the natural acoustic environment, consisting of natural sounds, including animal vocalizations, the collective habitat expression of which is now referred to as the biophony, and, for instance, the sounds of weather and other natural elements, now referred to as the geophony; and environmental sounds created by humans, the anthropophony through a sub-set called controlled sound, such as musical composition, sound design, and language, work, and sounds of mechanical origin resulting from use of industrial technology. Crucially, the term soundscape also includes the listener's perception of sounds heard as an environment: \\"how that environment is understood by those living within it\\" and therefore mediates their relations. The disruption of these acoustic environments results in noise pollution. The term \\"soundscape\\" can also refer to an audio recording or performance of sounds that create the sensation of experiencing a particular acoustic environment, or compositions created using the found sounds of an acoustic environment, either exclusively or in conjunction with musical performances. Pauline Oliveros, composer of post-World War II electronic art music, defined the term \\"soundscape\\" as \\"All of the waveforms faithfully transmitted to our audio cortex by the ear and its mechanisms\\".  Historical context  The origin of the term soundscape is somewhat ambiguous. It is often miscredited as having been coined by Canadian composer and naturalist, R. Murray Schafer, who indeed led much of the groundbreaking work on the subject from the 1960s and onwards. According to an interview with Schafer published in 2013 Schafer himself attributes the term to city planner Michael Southworth. Southworth, a former student of Kevin Lynch, led a project in Boston in the 1960s, and reported the findings in a paper entitled \\"The Sonic Environment of Cities,\\" in 1969, where the term is used. To complicate matters, however, a search in Google NGram reveals that soundscape had been used in other publications prior to this. More research is needed to establish the historical background in detail. Around the same time as Southworth's project in Boston, Schafer initiated the now famous World Soundscape project together with colleagues like Barry Truax and Hildegard Westerkamp. Schafer subsequently collected the findings from the world soundscape project and fleshed out the soundscape concept in more detail in his seminal work about the sound environment, \\"Tuning of the World.\\" Schafer has also used the concept in music education.  In music  In music, soundscape compositions are often a form of electronic music, or electroacoustic music. Composers who use soundscapes include real-time granular synthesis pioneer Barry Truax, Hildegard Westerkamp, and Luc Ferrari, whose Presque rien, num√©ro 1 (1970) is an early soundscape composition. Soundscape composer Petri Kuljuntausta has created soundscape compositions from the sounds of sky dome and Aurora Borealis and deep sea underwater recordings, and a work entitled \\"Charm of Sound\\" to be performed at the extreme environment of Saturn's moon Titan. The work landed on the ground of Titan in 2005 after traveling inside the spacecraft Huygens over seven years and four billion kilometres through space. Irv Teibel's Environments series (1969‚Äì79) consisted of 30-minute, uninterrupted environmental soundscapes and synthesized or processed versions of natural sound. Music soundscapes can also be generated by automated software methods, such as the experimental TAPESTREA application, a framework for sound design and soundscape composition, and others.Boodler ambient soundscape generator written in PythonfLOW ambient soundscape generator (Apple Macintosh) The soundscape is often the subject of mimicry in Timbre-centered music such as Tuvan throat singing. The process of Timbral Listening is used to interpret the timbre of the soundscape. This timbre is mimicked and reproduced using the voice or rich harmonic producing instruments. The environment In Schafer's analysis, there are two distinct soundscapes, either \\"hi-fi\\" or \\"lo-fi\\", created by the environment. A hi-fi system possesses a positive signal-to-noise ratio. These settings make it possible for discrete sounds to be heard clearly since there is no background noise to obstruct even the smallest disturbance. A rural landscape offers more hi-fi frequencies than a city because the natural landscape creates an opportunity to hear incidences from nearby and afar. In a lo-fi soundscape, signals are obscured by too many sounds, and perspective is lost within the broad-band of noises. In lo-fi soundscapes everything is very close and compact. A person can only listen to immediate encounters; in most cases even ordinary sounds have to be exuberantly amplified in order to be heard. All sounds are unique in nature. They occur at one time in one place and can't be replicated. In fact, it is physically impossible for nature to reproduce any phoneme twice in exactly the same manner. According to Schafer there are three main elements of the soundscape: * Keynote sounds : This is a musical term that identifies the key of a piece, not always audible ... the key might stray from the original, but it will return. The keynote sounds may not always be heard consciously, but they \\"outline the character of the people living there\\" (Schafer). They are created by nature (geography and climate): wind, water, forests, plains, birds, insects, animals. In many urban areas, traffic has become the keynote sound. * Sound signals : These are foreground sounds, which are listened to consciously; examples would be warning devices, bells, whistles, horns, sirens, etc. * Soundmark : This is derived from the term landmark. A soundmark is a sound which is unique to an area. In his 1977 book, The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World, Schafer wrote, \\"Once a Soundmark has been identified, it deserves to be protected, for soundmarks make the acoustic life of a community unique.\\" The elements have been further defined as to essential sources: Bernie Krause, naturalist and soundscape ecologist, redefined the sources of sound in terms of their three main components: geophony, biophony, and anthropophony. * Geophony : Consisting of the prefix, geo (gr. earth), and phon (gr. sound), this refers to the soundscape sources that are generated by non-biological natural sources such as wind in the trees, water in a stream or waves at the ocean, and earth movement, the first sounds heard on earth by any sound-sentient organism. * Biophony : Consisting of the prefix, bio (gr. life) and the suffix for sound, this term refers to all of the non-human, non-domestic biological soundscape sources of sound. * Anthropophony : Consisting of the prefix, anthro (gr. human), this term refers to all of the sound signatures generated by humans.  In health care  Research has traditionally focused mostly on the negative effects of sound on human beings, as in exposure to environmental noise. Noise has been shown to correlate with health-related problems like stress, reduced sleep and cardiovascular disease. More recently however, it has also been shown that some sounds, like sounds of nature and music, can have positive effects on health. While the negative effects of sound has been widely acknowledged by organizations like EU (END 2002/49) and WHO (Burden of noise disease), the positive effects have as yet received less attention. The positive effects of nature sounds can be acknowledged in everyday planning of urban and rural environments, as well as in specific health treatment situations, like nature-based sound therapy and nature-based rehabilitation. Soundscapes from a computerized acoustic device with a camera may also offer synthetic vision to the blind, utilizing human echolocation, as is the goal of the seeing with sound project.Seeing with Sound  Soundscapes and noise pollution  Papers on noise pollution are increasingly taking a holistic, soundscape approach to noise control. Whereas acoustics tends to rely on lab measurements and individual acoustic characteristics of cars and so on, soundscape takes a top-down approach. Drawing on John Cage's ideas of the whole world as composition,needs citation soundscape researchers investigate people's attitudes to soundscapes as a whole rather than individual aspects ‚Äì and look at how the entire environment can be changed to be more pleasing to the ear. A typical application of this is the use of masking strategies, as in the use of water features to cover unwanted white noise from traffic. It has been shown that masking can work in some cases, but that the successful outcome is dependent on several factors, like sound pressure levels, orientation of the sources, and character of the water sound. Research has shown that variation is an important factor to consider, as a varied soundscape give people the possibility to seek out their favorite environment depending on preference, mood and other factors. One way to ensure variation is to work with\\"quiet areas\\" in urban situations. It has been suggested that people's opportunity to access quiet, natural places in urban areas can be enhanced by improving the ecological quality of urban green spaces through targeted planning and design and that in turn has psychological benefits. Soundscaping as a method to reducing noise pollution incorporates natural elements rather than just man made elements. Soundscapes can be designed by urban planners and landscape architects. By incorporating knowledge of soundscapes in their work, certain sounds can be enhanced, while others can be reduced or controlled. It has been argued that there are three main ways in which soundscapes can be designed: localization of functions, reduction of unwanted sounds and introduction of wanted sounds., each of which should be considered to ensure a comprehensive approach to soundscape design.  In United States National Parks  The National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies DivisionNational Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division actively protects the soundscapes and acoustic environments in national parks across the country. It is important to distinguish and define certain key terms as used by the National Park Service. Acoustic resources are physical sound sources, including both natural sounds (wind, water, wildlife, vegetation) and cultural and historic sounds (battle reenactments, tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence). The acoustic environment is the combination of all the acoustic resources within a given area ‚Äì natural sounds and human- caused sounds ‚Äì as modified by the environment. The acoustic environment includes sound vibrations made by geological processes, biological activity, and even sounds that are inaudible to most humans, such as bat echolocation calls. Soundscape is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived and comprehended by the humans. The character and quality of the soundscape influence human perceptions of an area, providing a sense of place that differentiates it from other regions. Noise refers to sound which is unwanted, either because of its effects on humans and wildlife, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. Cultural soundscapes include opportunities for appropriate transmission of cultural and historic sounds that are fundamental components of the purposes and values for which the parks were established. * Sounds recorded in national parksSounds recorded in national parks * Yellowstone National Park Sound LibraryYellowstone National Park Sound Library  See also  * Ambient music * Anthropophony * Biomusic * Biophony * Ecoacoustics * Environments (series) * Field recording * Geophony * Musique concr√®te * Noise map * Program music * Sharawadji effect * Sound art * Sound installation * Sound map * Sound sculpture * Soundscape ecology * Space music * Underwater acoustics  References   Further reading  * 1969 The New Soundscape - R.

Early life Fernow was born in Pomerania, the son of a servant in the household of the lord of Blumenhagen. At the age of twelve he became clerk to a notary, and was afterwards apprenticed to a druggist. While serving his time he had the misfortune accidentally to shoot a young man who came to visit him; and although through the intercession of his master he escaped prosecution, the untoward event weighed heavily on his mind, and led him at the close of his apprenticeship to quit his native place. Art career He obtained a situation at L√ºbeck, where he had leisure to cultivate his natural taste for drawing and poetry. Having formed an acquaintance with the painter Asmus Jacob Carstens, whose influence was an important stimulus and help to him, he renounced his trade of druggist, and set up as a portrait-painter and drawing-master. At Ludwigslust he fell in love with a young girl, and followed her to Weimar; but failing in his suit, he went next to Jena. There he was introduced to Professor Reinhold, and in his house met the Danish poet Jens Immanuel Baggesen. The latter invited him to accompany him to Switzerland and Italy, a proposal which in 1794 he eagerly accepted for the sake of the opportunity of furthering his studies in the fine arts. On Baggesen's return to Denmark, Fernow, assisted by some of his friends, visited Rome and made some stay there. He now renewed his intercourse with Carstens, who had settled at Rome, and applied himself to the study of the history and theory of the fine arts and of the Italian language and literature. Fernow's critiques and opinions have been questioned and poorly received due to his lack of formal qualification. His personal attacks on artists are thought to reflect his own lack of artistic talent and insight. Fernow self-proclaimed to have made rapid progress, he was soon semi-qualified to give a course of lectures on archaeology, which was attended by the principal artists then at Rome. Having married a Roman lady, he returned in 1802 to Germany, and was appointed in the following year professor extraordinary of Italian literature at Jena. Librarian In 1804 he accepted the post of librarian to Amalia, Dowager Duchess of Weimar, which gave him the leisure he desired for the purpose of turning to account the literary and archaeological researches in which he had engaged at Rome. Fernow died in 1808 at Weimar, where he is buried in the Jacobsfriedhof. Works and biography His most valuable work, the Romische Studien, appeared in 3 volumes between 1806 and 1808. Among his other works are Das Leben des Kunstlers Carstens (1806), Ariostos Lebenslauf (1809), and Francesco Petrarca (1818). A memoir of his life by Johanna Schopenhauer, mother of the philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, appeared in 1810, and a complete edition of his works in 1829.

Sometimes this effect is interpreted as \\"a system cannot change while you are watching it\\".https://phys.org/news/2015-10-zeno-effect-verifiedatoms- wont.html. One can \\"freeze\\" the evolution of the system by measuring it frequently enough in its known initial state. The meaning of the term has since expanded, leading to a more technical definition, in which time evolution can be suppressed not only by measurement: the quantum Zeno effect is the suppression of unitary time evolution in quantum systems provided by a variety of sources: measurement, interactions with the environment, stochastic fields, among other factors. As an outgrowth of study of the quantum Zeno effect, it has become clear that applying a series of sufficiently strong and fast pulses with appropriate symmetry can also decouple a system from its decohering environment. The name comes from Zeno's arrow paradox, which states that because an arrow in flight is not seen to move during any single instant, it cannot possibly be moving at all.The idea depends on the instant of time, a kind of freeze-motion idea that the arrow is \\"strobed\\" at each instant and is seemingly stationary, so how can it move in a succession of stationary events? The first rigorous and general derivation of the quantum Zeno effect was presented in 1974 by Degasperis, Fonda, and Ghirardi, although it had previously been described by Alan Turing. The comparison with Zeno's paradox is due to a 1977 article by George Sudarshan and Baidyanath Misra. According to the reduction postulate, each measurement causes the wavefunction to collapse to an eigenstate of the measurement basis. In the context of this effect, an observation can simply be the absorption of a particle, without the need of an observer in any conventional sense. However, there is controversy over the interpretation of the effect, sometimes referred to as the \\"measurement problem\\" in traversing the interface between microscopic and macroscopic objects. Another crucial problem related to the effect is strictly connected to the time‚Äìenergy indeterminacy relation (part of the indeterminacy principle). If one wants to make the measurement process more and more frequent, one has to correspondingly decrease the time duration of the measurement itself. But the request that the measurement last only a very short time implies that the energy spread of the state in which reduction occurs becomes increasingly large. However, the deviations from the exponential decay law for small times is crucially related to the inverse of the energy spread, so that the region in which the deviations are appreciable shrinks when one makes the measurement process duration shorter and shorter. An explicit evaluation of these two competing requests shows that it is inappropriate, without taking into account this basic fact, to deal with the actual occurrence and emergence of Zeno's effect. Closely related (and sometimes not distinguished from the quantum Zeno effect) is the watchdog effect, in which the time evolution of a system is affected by its continuous coupling to the environment. Description Unstable quantum systems are predicted to exhibit a short-time deviation from the exponential decay law. This universal phenomenon has led to the prediction that frequent measurements during this nonexponential period could inhibit decay of the system, one form of the quantum Zeno effect. Subsequently, it was predicted that measurements applied more slowly could also enhance decay rates, a phenomenon known as the quantum anti-Zeno effect. In quantum mechanics, the interaction mentioned is called \\"measurement\\" because its result can be interpreted in terms of classical mechanics. Frequent measurement prohibits the transition. It can be a transition of a particle from one half-space to another (which could be used for an atomic mirror in an atomic nanoscope ) as in the time-of-arrival problem, a transition of a photon in a waveguide from one mode to another, and it can be a transition of an atom from one quantum state to another. It can be a transition from the subspace without decoherent loss of a qubit to a state with a qubit lost in a quantum computer. In this sense, for the qubit correction, it is sufficient to determine whether the decoherence has already occurred or not. All these can be considered as applications of the Zeno effect. By its nature, the effect appears only in systems with distinguishable quantum states, and hence is inapplicable to classical phenomena and macroscopic bodies. The mathematician Robin Gandy recalled Turing's formulation of the quantum Zeno effect in a letter to fellow mathematician Max Newman, shortly after Turing's death: As a result of Turing's suggestion, the quantum Zeno effect is also sometimes known as the Turing paradox. The idea is implicit in the early work of John von Neumann on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, and in particular the rule sometimes called the reduction postulate. See also ); ; It was later shown that the quantum Zeno effect of a single system is equivalent to the indetermination of the quantum state of a single system. Various realizations and general definition The treatment of the Zeno effect as a paradox is not limited to the processes of quantum decay. In general, the term Zeno effect is applied to various transitions, and sometimes these transitions may be very different from a mere \\"decay\\" (whether exponential or non-exponential). One realization refers to the observation of an object (Zeno's arrow, or any quantum particle) as it leaves some region of space. In the 20th century, the trapping (confinement) of a particle in some region by its observation outside the region was considered as nonsensical, indicating some non-completeness of quantum mechanics. Even as late as 2001, confinement by absorption was considered as a paradox. Later, similar effects of the suppression of Raman scattering was considered an expected effect, not a paradox at all. The absorption of a photon at some wavelength, the release of a photon (for example one that has escaped from some mode of a fiber), or even the relaxation of a particle as it enters some region, are all processes that can be interpreted as measurement. Such a measurement suppresses the transition, and is called the Zeno effect in the scientific literature. In order to cover all of these phenomena (including the original effect of suppression of quantum decay), the Zeno effect can be defined as a class of phenomena in which some transition is suppressed by an interaction ‚Äì one that allows the interpretation of the resulting state in the terms 'transition did not yet happen' and 'transition has already occurred', or 'The proposition that the evolution of a quantum system is halted' if the state of the system is continuously measured by a macroscopic device to check whether the system is still in its initial state. Periodic measurement of a quantum system Consider a system in a state A, which is the eigenstate of some measurement operator. Say the system under free time evolution will decay with a certain probability into state B. If measurements are made periodically, with some finite interval between each one, at each measurement, the wave function collapses to an eigenstate of the measurement operator. Between the measurements, the system evolves away from this eigenstate into a superposition state of the states A and B. When the superposition state is measured, it will again collapse, either back into state A as in the first measurement, or away into state B. However, its probability of collapsing into state B after a very short amount of time t is proportional to t^2, since probabilities are proportional to squared amplitudes, and amplitudes behave linearly. Thus, in the limit of a large number of short intervals, with a measurement at the end of every interval, the probability of making the transition to B goes to zero. According to decoherence theory, the collapse of the wave function is not a discrete, instantaneous event. A \\"measurement\\" is equivalent to strongly coupling the quantum system to the noisy thermal environment for a brief period of time, and continuous strong coupling is equivalent to frequent \\"measurement\\". The time it takes for the wave function to \\"collapse\\" is related to the decoherence time of the system when coupled to the environment. The stronger the coupling is, and the shorter the decoherence time, the faster it will collapse. So in the decoherence picture, a perfect implementation of the quantum Zeno effect corresponds to the limit where a quantum system is continuously coupled to the environment, and where that coupling is infinitely strong, and where the \\"environment\\" is an infinitely large source of thermal randomness. Experiments and discussion Experimentally, strong suppression of the evolution of a quantum system due to environmental coupling has been observed in a number of microscopic systems. In 1989, David J. Wineland and his group at NIST observed the quantum Zeno effect for a two-level atomic system that was interrogated during its evolution. Approximately 5,000 ions were stored in a cylindrical Penning trap and laser-cooled to below 250 mK. A resonant RF pulse was applied, which, if applied alone, would cause the entire ground-state population to migrate into an excited state. After the pulse was applied, the ions were monitored for photons emitted due to relaxation. The ion trap was then regularly \\"measured\\" by applying a sequence of ultraviolet pulses during the RF pulse. As expected, the ultraviolet pulses suppressed the evolution of the system into the excited state. The results were in good agreement with theoretical models. A recent review describes subsequent work in this area. In 2001, Mark G. Raizen and his group at the University of Texas at Austin observed the quantum Zeno effect for an unstable quantum system, as originally proposed by Sudarshan and Misra. They also observed an anti-Zeno effect. Ultracold sodium atoms were trapped in an accelerating optical lattice, and the loss due to tunneling was measured. The evolution was interrupted by reducing the acceleration, thereby stopping quantum tunneling. The group observed suppression or enhancement of the decay rate, depending on the regime of measurement. In 2015, Mukund Vengalattore and his group at Cornell University demonstrated a quantum Zeno effect as the modulation of the rate of quantum tunnelling in an ultracold lattice gas by the intensity of light used to image the atoms. The quantum Zeno effect is used in commercial atomic magnetometers and naturally by birds' magnetic compass sensory mechanism (magnetoreception). It is still an open question how closely one can approach the limit of an infinite number of interrogations due to the Heisenberg uncertainty involved in shorter measurement times. It has been shown, however, that measurements performed at a finite frequency can yield arbitrarily strong Zeno effects. In 2006, Streed et al. at MIT observed the dependence of the Zeno effect on measurement pulse characteristics. The interpretation of experiments in terms of the \\"Zeno effect\\" helps describe the origin of a phenomenon. Nevertheless, such an interpretation does not bring any principally new features not described with the Schr√∂dinger equation of the quantum system. Even more, the detailed description of experiments with the \\"Zeno effect\\", especially at the limit of high frequency of measurements (high efficiency of suppression of transition, or high reflectivity of a ridged mirror) usually do not behave as expected for an idealized measurement. It was shown that the quantum Zeno effect persists in the many-worlds and relative-states interpretations of quantum mechanics.

Lines of the Pentateuch alternate with the Targum ascribed to Onkelos (a convert to Judaism) Conversion to Judaism (, giyur) is the process by which non-Jews adopt the Jewish religion and become members of the Jewish ethnoreligious community. It thus resembles both conversion to other religions and naturalization. \\"Thus, by converting to Judaism, the religion, a gentile becomes not only a Judahist‚Äîone who practices Judaism‚Äîbut a jew. Such a one is then part of the Jewish community as much as of the community of Judaism\\" The procedure and requirements for conversion depend on the sponsoring denomination. A conversion in accordance with the process of a denomination is not a guarantee of recognition by another denomination. A formal conversion is also sometimes undertaken by individuals whose Jewish ancestry is questioned, even if they were raised Jewish, but may not actually be considered Jews according to traditional Jewish law. In some cases, a person may forgo a formal conversion to Judaism and adopt some or all beliefs and practices of Judaism. However, without a formal conversion, many observant Jews will reject a convert's Jewish status. There are some groups that have adopted Jewish customs and practices. For example, in Russia the Subbotniks have adopted most aspects of Judaism without formal conversion to Judaism. However, if Subbotniks, or anyone without a formal conversion, wish to marry into a traditional Jewish community or immigrate to Israel under the Act of Return, they must have a formal conversion.  Terminology  The word ger comes from the Hebrew verb lagur (◊ú◊í◊ï◊®) meaning \\"to reside\\" or \\"to sojourn [with]\\". In the Hebrew Bible ger is defined as a \\"foreigner\\", or \\"sojourner\\". Rabbi Marc Angel writes: Angel's explanation of the literal meaning of \\"ger\\" as alien is borne out in biblical verses such as : Another passage which may be relevant to a process of conversion involves non-Jewish women captured in war who could be adopted forcibly as wives (). Another verse which has been interpreted as referring to non-Jews converting to Judaism is Esther 8:17, although no process is described. (). The word is rendered by the Greek \\"proselyte\\" as used in the Septuagint to denote a \\"stranger\\". A male convert to Judaism is referred to by the Hebrew word ger (, plural gerim) and a female convert is a giyoret. In all branches of Judaism, a ger or giyoret is considered a full Jew; the literal meaning of \\"stranger,\\" \\"resident,\\" or \\"foreigner\\" refers to the convert's origin, not present status. In Karaite Judaism the term ger only refers to a non-Jew who has yet to fully convert to Judaism, and once converted to Karaitism, is no longer called ger.http://www.karaitejudaism.org/talks/Gerim_By_Eliezer_haKohen.pdf In the Talmud, ger is used in two senses: ger tzedek refers to a \\"righteous convert\\", a proselyte to Judaism, and ger toshav, a non-Jewish inhabitant of the Land of Israel who observes the Seven Laws of Noah and has repudiated all links with idolatry. In Modern Hebrew, the unqualified term ger means ger tzedek. Overview According to Maimonides (Isurei Biah 13:14), converts were accepted since the beginning of Jewish history, and the foreign wives of Jewish leaders - such as Samson and Solomon - were converts. Yet he says (Isurei Biah 13:15), that in the times of Jewish political power, such as the days of Kings David and Solomon, Batei Dinim (Jewish courts) did not accept converts who may have not had the right intention, and they had to wait and prove their intentions to be legally accepted. Nowadays, with the notable exception of some Syrian Jewish communities, (primarily the Brooklyn, NY and Deal, NJ communities), all mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, with all denominations accepting converts converted by their denominations. The rules vary between denominations, as does acceptance of some denominations' converts by other denominations. For Rabbinic Judaism, the laws governing conversion (gerut) are based on codes of law and texts, including discussions in the Talmud, through the Shulkhan Arukh and subsequent interpretations. (Many of the guidelines of accepting converts are based on the Book of Ruth and the manner whereby Ruth was brought into the fold through her mother-in-law, Naomi). These rules are held as authoritative by Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism. Within Orthodoxy it is commonly understood that Halacha somewhat discourages proselytizing, and religious gerut is somewhat discouraged. Some rabbis reject potential converts three times, and if they remained adamant in their desire to convert, they would then allow them to begin the process. These practices do not have any solid basis in the written text, and while they may have been the practice in some locations, it was not universal, and a number of rabbis have not followed these practices. In order to convert, the conversion candidate must have a circumcision (males) and immerse in the mikveh before a kosher beth din, comprising 3 Jewish males who are shomer Shabbat. There is also a requirement to accept the commandments (although not necessarily a commitment to keep the mitzvot), although without this step there are many authorities who will accept the conversion as valid. In the past it is likely that conversions happened like this, and were decentralized, and universally accepted once performed. Today, the process has become more centralized, with the conversion candidate having to convince a rabbi and the beth din of their sincerity, and there will usually be a considerable amount of study. They will then be tested and formally accepted, the convert is issued with a Shtar geirut (\\"Certificate of Conversion\\"). As the conversion process becomes more centralized there are only a limited number of conversion courts that are 'acceptable' to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. However, there are a number of rabbis who are willing to conduct decentralized conversions today, and are recognized by each other. Two of the more prominent of these rabbis are Chuck Davidson and Haim Amsalem. Conservative Judaism takes a more lenient approach in application of the halakhic rules than Modern Orthodox Judaism. Its approach to the validity of conversions is based on whether the conversion procedure followed rabbinic norms, rather than the reliability of those performing it or the nature of the obligations the convert undertook. Accordingly, it may accept the validity of some Reform and Reconstructionist conversions, but only if they include immersion in a ritual bath (mikvah), appearance before a rabbinical court (beit din) and, for men, circumcision (brit milah) or a symbolic circumcision for those already circumcised (hatafat dam brit). The requirements of Reform Judaism for conversions are different. The denomination states that \\"people considering conversion are expected to study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community, though most now require a course in basic Judaism and individual study with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life.\\" Although an infant conversion might be accepted in some circumstances (such as in the case of adopted children or children whose parents convert), children who convert would typically be asked if they want to remain Jewish after reaching religious adulthood ‚Äì which is 12 years of age for a girl and 13 for a boy. This standard is applied by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, which accept halakha as binding.Robinson, George. Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs and Rituals. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000. , pgs 229‚Äì232. Reconstructionist Judaism values the symbolism of the conversion ritual, and encourages those who were not born of Jewish parents and who wish to convert to undergo this rite of passage. The Reconstructionist course of study for a prospective convert, which is determined by the rabbi and congregation the individual is working with, includes history, observance and beliefs, and learning how to make educated choices. The completion of the process is marked by ritual immersion for men and women; circumcision or hatafat dam brit (symbolic drop of blood) for men (unless there exists an extraordinary physical or emotional hazard); a Bet Din (a dialogue with three knowledgeable Jews, at least one of whom is a rabbi), and often a public welcoming ceremony. Karaite Judaism does not accept Rabbinic Judaism and has different requirements for conversion. Traditionally non-proselytizing, Karaite Judaism's long standing abstention from conversions was recently lifted. On 1 August 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.Karaites hold first conversion in 500 years . 2 August 2007, JTA Breaking News. Requirements The Amoraim who produced the Talmud set out three requirements for a conversion to Judaism (Keritot 8b), which must be witnessed and affirmed by a beth din hedyot rabbinical court composed of three Jewish males above the age of thirteen (they do not need to be rabbis): * Circumcision (Brit milah or hatafat dam brit) for men * Immersion (tevilah) in a ritual bath (mikveh) for both men and women * Offering a certain sacrifice (korban) in the Temple (the Beit Hamikdash) ‚Äì this requirement is deferred while the Temple does not exist until such time as it may be rebuilt. The consensus of halakhic authorities also requires a convert to understand and accept the duties of the classical Jewish law. This is not stated explicitly in the Talmud, but was inferred by subsequent commentators. After confirming that all these requirements have been met, the beth din issues a \\"Certificate of Conversion\\" (Shtar Giur), certifying that the person is now a Jew. Early debate on requirement for circumcision According to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on circumcision of proselytes, in the 1st century CE, before the Mishnah was edited, the requirement for circumcision of proselytes was an open issue between the zealots and liberal parties in ancient Israel. R. Joshua argued that besides accepting Jewish beliefs and laws, a prospective convert to Judaism must undergo immersion in a mikveh. In contrast, R. Eliezer makes circumcision a condition for the conversion. A similar controversy between the Shammaites and the Hillelites is given regarding a proselyte born without a foreskin: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood symbolic of the Brit Milah, thereby entering into the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 135a and Gerim 2:2, cited in The Way of the Boundary Crosser: An Introduction to Jewish Flexidoxy. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. 214-19. In discussions about the necessity of circumcision for those born of a Jewish mother, lending some support to the need for circumcision of converts, the Midrash states: \\"If thy sons accept My Godhead [by undergoing circumcision] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the Sabbath, they shall not enter the land of promise\\" (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi). \\"The Sabbath-keepers who are not circumcised are intruders, and deserve punishment\\" (Midrash Deut. Rabbah i). However, the opposing view is supported in the Babylonian Talmud: \\"A male convert who has been immersed but not circumcised, or circumcised but not immersed, is a convert.\\"Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 46a and Gerim 1:6, cited in The Way of the Boundary Crosser: An Introduction to Jewish Flexidoxy. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. 214-19 Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities Book 20 Chapter 2 recorded the story of King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such \\"strange and foreign rites\\". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in James the Brother of Jesus claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views, although this is a novel interpretation lacking support in mainstream scholarship) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, \\"a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar\\", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought much food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.Josephus F, Retrieved 2011-1-20 Book 20 Chapter 2 Modern practice The requirements for conversions vary somewhat within the different branches of Judaism, so whether or not a conversion is recognized by another denomination is often an issue fraught with religious politics. The Orthodox rejection of non-Orthodox conversions is derived less from qualms with the conversion process itself, since Conservative and even some Reform conversions are ostensibly very similar to Orthodox conversions with respect to duration and content, but rather from that the convert was presumably not properly (i.e. according to tradition) instructed in Jewish Law, and the procedure of conversion has a chance of not having been done properly, and that those overseeing the process were (almost certainly) not qualified to test the convert (and in any case would have had different answers). In general, immersion in the mikveh is an important part of a traditional conversion. If the person who is converting is male, circumcision is a part of the traditional conversion process as well. If the male who is converting has already been circumcised, then a ritual removal of a single drop of blood will take place (hatafat dam brit). However, more liberal branches of Judaism have a more relaxed requirement of immersion and circumcision. Maturity Someone who converts as a minor (younger than 12 for a girl and 13 for a boy) is required to fulfill the requirements of conversion, that is circumcision and mikvah, but are not required to perform an 'acceptance of the mitzvoth'. The conversion instead is done al daat beth din, the acceptance is done by the Beth Din presiding over the conversion. The child lives as a Jew until their bar/bat mitzvah and they then have the option of rejecting their conversion. Once they have accepted to continue as a Jew the conversion can no longer be rejected. Reform Jewish views In the United States, Reform Judaism rejects the concept that any rules or rituals should be considered necessary for conversion to Judaism. In the late 19th century, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the official body of American Reform rabbis, formally resolved to permit the admission of converts \\"without any initiatory rite, ceremony, or observance whatsoever\\". (CCAR Yearbook 3 (1893), 73‚Äì95; American Reform Responsa (ARR), no. 68, at 236‚Äì237.) Although this resolution has often been examined critically by many Reform rabbis, the resolution still remains the official policy of American Reform Judaism (CCAR Responsa \\"Circumcision for an Eight-Year-Old Convert\\" 5756.13 and Solomon Freehof, Reform Responsa for Our Time, no. 15.) Thus, American Reform Judaism does not require ritual immersion in a mikveh, circumcision, or acceptance of mitzvot as normative. Appearance before a Beth Din is recommended, but is not considered necessary. Converts are asked to commit to religious standards set by the local Reform community. In actual practice, the requirements for conversion of any individual are determined by the Rabbi who sponsors the convert. Typically, Reform Rabbis require prospective converts to take a course of study in Judaism, such as an \\"Introduction to Judaism\\" course, to participate in worship at a synagogue, and to live as a Jew (however that is interpreted by the individual Rabbi) for a period of time. A period of one year is common, although individual Rabbis' requirements vary. When the sponsoring Rabbi feels that the candidate is ready, a Beth Din may be convened. Other rituals such as immersion in a mikvah, circumcision (or Hatafat dam brit), and a public ceremony to celebrate the conversion, are also at the discretion of the Rabbi. Interdenominational views In response to the tremendous variations that exist within the Reform community, the Conservative Jewish movement attempted to set a nuanced approach. The Conservative Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued a legal opinion stating that Reform conversions may be accepted as valid only when they include the minimal Conservative halachic requirements of milah and t'vilah, appearance before a Conservative Beth Din, and a course of Conservative study. (Proceedings of Committee on Jewish Law and Standards: 1980‚Äì1985, pp. 77‚Äì101.) In general, branches of Orthodox Judaism consider non-Orthodox conversions either inadequate or of questionable halachic compliance, and such conversions are therefore not accepted by these branches of Judaism. Conversely, both Conservative and Reform Judaism accept the Orthodox conversion process as being valid. Since 2008, Haredi Orthodox religious courts in Israel have been rejecting conversions from a number of Orthodox rabbis, since the Chief Rabbinate do not accept the authority of the presiding rabbis.https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/israels-conversion-laws-are-about- to-get-stricter/ Intra-Orthodox controversy In 2008, a Haredi-dominated Badatz in Israel annulled thousands of conversions performed by the Military Rabbinate in Israel. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which is the only state- recognized authority on religious matters, backed by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruled against this, making the annulment legally invalid for purposes of Israeli law. Canadian Orthodox program There are two orthodox conversion programmes in Montreal. One is made up of a Bet Din (Jewish Court) of congregational member rabbis from the Rabbinical Council of America, Montreal region (RCA). This program provides a way to convert according to the rigorous rules of Halachah while making the process more \\"user friendly\\" for non-Jewish individuals seeking a more \\"hands-on\\" or \\"modern Orthodox\\" approach. The second program is supervised by the Jewish Community Council of Montreal, the Vaad Hair. All conversion candidates‚Äîwho could include singles, non-Jewish couples and adoption cases‚Äîmust have a sponsoring rabbi and undergo a rigorous screening process. Conversions stemming from both programs are recognized in Israel and around the world. Karaite views As of 2006, the Moetzet Hakhamim (Council of Sages) began to accept converts to Karaite Judaism through the Karaite Jewish University. The process requires one year of learning, circumcision (for males), and the taking of the vow that Ruth took. > \\"For whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; > thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest, will I > die, and there will I be buried; the do so to me, and more also, if aught > but death part thee and me.\\" Attempts to resolve the \\"Who is a Jew?\\" issue 1950s: proposed joint beth din In the 1950s Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and other members of the Rabbinical Council of America engaged in a series of private negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism's Rabbinical Assembly, including Saul Lieberman; their goal was to create a joint Orthodox-Conservative national beth din for all Jews in the United States. It would create communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, where all the judges would have been Orthodox, while it would have been accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly created a Joint Conference on Jewish Law, devoting a year to this effort. For a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Louis Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was the Orthodox rabbis' insistence that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly agree to expel Conservative rabbis for actions they took prior to the formation of the new beth din, and the RA refused to do so. According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from haredi Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpern, of the Joint Conference wrote a report on the demise of this beth din. He writes that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative denominations were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: The RA must \\"impose severe sanctions\\" upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before this new beth din was formed. Halpern writes that the RA \\"could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group\\". He goes on to write that although subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis are forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis.Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927‚Äì1970 Vol. II, p.850-852. 1978‚Äì1983: Denver program, patrilineal descent  In Denver, Colorado, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din was formed to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism. A number of rabbis were Orthodox and had semicha from Orthodox yeshivas, but were serving in synagogues without a mechitza; these synagogues were called traditional Judaism. Over a five-year period they performed some 750 conversions to Judaism. However, in 1983 the joint Beth Din was dissolved, due to the unilateral American Reform Jewish decision to change the definition of Jewishness. Specifically, in 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother. However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing \\"that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process\\". Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis \\"would be able to take local decisions ‚Äì ratified by the Beit Din ‚Äì confirming Jewish status\\". The end of the joint Beth Din program was welcomed by Haredi Orthodox groups, who saw the program as illegitimate. Further, Haredi groups attempted to prevent non-Orthodox rabbis from following the traditional requirements of converts using a mikveh. In the Haredi view, it is better to have no conversion at all than a non-Orthodox conversion, as all non-Orthodox conversions are not true conversions at all according to them.Fifth Anniversary of the Mikveh of East Denver, Hillel Goldberg 1980s: proposed Israeli joint beth din In the 1980s Modern Orthodox Rabbi Norman Lamm, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva University, along with other American and Israeli Orthodox rabbis, worked with Conservative and Reform rabbis to come up with solution to the \\"Who is a Jew?\\" issue. In 1989 and 1990 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir spearheaded an effort to find a way to resolve the impasse. A plan was developed by Israeli Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubenstein, who negotiated secretly for many months with rabbis from Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Judaism, including faculty at Yeshiva University, with Lamm as Rosh Yeshiva. They were planning to create a joint panel that interviewed people who were converting to Judaism and considering making aliyah (moving to the State of Israel), and would refer them to a beth din that would convert the candidate following traditional halakha. All negotiating parties came to agreement: # Conversions must be carried out according to halakha # the beth din (rabbinic court) overseeing the conversion would be Orthodox, perhaps appointed by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and # there would be three-way dialogue throughout the process. Many Reform rabbis took offense at the notion that the beth din must be strictly halakhic and Orthodox, but they acquiesced. However, when word about this project became public, a number of leading haredi rabbis issued a statement denouncing the project, condemning it as a \\"travesty of halakha\\". Rabbi Moshe Sherer, Chairman of Agudath Israel World Organization, stated that \\"Yes we played a role in putting an end to that farce, and I'm proud we did\\". Norman Lamm condemned this interference by Sherer, stating that this was \\"the most damaging thing that he [Sherer] ever did in his forty year career\\". Rabbi Lamm wanted this to be only the beginning of a solution to Jewish disunity. He stated that had this unified conversion plan not been destroyed, he wanted to extend this program to the area of halakhic Jewish divorces, thus ending the problem of mamzerut. 1997: Neeman Commission proposal In 1997 the issue of \\"Who is a Jew?\\" again arose in the State of Israel, and Orthodox leaders such as Rabbi Norman Lamm publicly backed the Neeman commission, a group of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis working to develop joint programs for conversion to Judaism. In 1997 Lamm gave a speech at the World Council of Orthodox Leadership, in Glen Springs, N.Y., urging Orthodox Jews to support this effort. The committee recommended the establishment of a joint institute for Jewish studies, which would be a joint effort by all three streams of Judaism. The committee also recommended that conversion proceedings themselves be held in special conversion courts, to be recognized by all denominations in Judaism. The purpose of the proposal was to prevent a rift in the Jewish people, while at the same time bringing about a state-sponsored arrangement for conversion. On 7 September 1998, the government adopted the Ne'eman Commission Report. A year later, the Joint Institute for Jewish Studies was established, and since then it has been the official state operator of conversion courses in Israel, including the military conversion courses. In 2015 the institute's name was changed to Nativ ‚Äì The National Center for Jewish Studies, Identity and Conversion. Conversion annulments A recent development has been the concept of annulling conversions to Judaism, sometimes many years after they have taken place, due to a reduction in religious observance or change of community by the convert. This is unknown in rabbinic literature, where conversion is considered irreversible. Chuck Davidson, a Modern Orthodox expert on this conversion crisis explains \\"From the Middle Ages onwards, the greatest of the rabbis wrote explicitly that even if immediately after the conversion the convert goes off to worship idols, the person is still considered Jewish\\". The justification given for the change in approach is that the original conversion must never have been valid in the first place as it is clear from the convert's subsequent actions they were insincere at the time of conversion. A situation of confusion and instability in Jewish identity in Israel was made worse when Haredi Rabbi Avraham Sherman of Israel's supreme religious court called into question the validity of over 40,000 Jewish conversions when he upheld a ruling by the Ashdod Rabbinical Court to retroactively annul the conversion of a woman who came before them because in their eyes she failed to observe Jewish law (an orthodox lifestyle).A Tragic Annulment, Jerusalem Report, September 2008: Cancelled Conversion: Center for Women's Justice, Israel. This crisis deepened, when Israel's Rabbinate called into question the validity of soldiers who had undergone conversion in the army, meaning a soldier killed in action could not be buried according to Jewish law. In 2010, the rabbinate created a further distrust in the conversion process when it began refusing to recognize orthodox converts from the United States as Jewish. Indeed, the great-niece of the renowned Zionist Nahum Sokolow was recently deemed \\"not Jewish enough\\" to marry in Israel, after she failed to prove the purity of Jewish blood for four generations. Following a scandal in which U.S. Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested on charges of installing hidden cameras in a mikveh to film women converts undressing, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate said it would review the validity of all past conversions performed by Freundel, then quickly reversed its decision, clarifying that it was joining the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America in affirming the validity of the conversions. In December 2014 an Israeli court decided that a conversion could be annulled. In his decision Justice Neal Hendel wrote: \\"Just as the civil court has the inalienable authority to reverse ‚Äì in extremely rare cases ‚Äì a final judgment, so too does the special religious conversion court. For otherwise, we would allow for judgments that are flawed from their inception to exist eternally.\\" Consequences Once undergone, a valid religious conversion to Judaism cannot be overturned. However, a Beth Din may determine that the conversion is void as it was never undertaken correctly in the first place. For example, if the rite of mikveh was performed incorrectly. In recent years many Orthodox conversions have been overturned. In 2008 Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.Strains Grow Between Israel and Many Jews in the U.S. New York Times, 6 February 2015 Debate on what constitutes a valid Beth Din for conversion and for annulling conversions has caused divisions in the Orthodox world. It is an implicit judgment on the character and uprightness of the rabbis in that religious court. For example, when Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested on charges of voyeurism for filming women converts at the mikveh he supervised, Israel's Chief Rabbinate initially threatened to review and possibly invalidate the conversions Freundel had been involved in approving. A crisis between American and Israeli rabbis was averted when the Chief Rabbinate agreed that all conversions completed by Freundel would be considered valid.Conversions Performed By Barry Freundel, Rabbi Arrested For Voyeurism, Still Legitimate: Israel Rabbinate, Huffington Post, 22 October 2014 Relations between Jews and proselytes Judaism is not currently an openly proselytizing religion. Judaism teaches that the righteous of all nations have a place in the afterlife. Much like in the other Abrahamic faiths, Jewish law requires the sincerity of a potential convert. In view of the foregoing considerations, most authorities are very careful about it. Essentially, they want to be sure that the convert knows what they are getting into, and that they are doing it for sincerely religious reasons. However, while conversion for the sake of love for Judaism is considered the best motivation, a conversion for the sake of avoiding intermarriage is gaining acceptance also. There is a tradition that a prospective convert should be turned away three times as a test of sincerity, though most rabbis no longer follow the tradition. Neither the Rabbinical Council of America nor the Rabbinical Assembly, the leading American Orthodox and Conservative organizations suggest taking this action in their conversion policies, with the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) and Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) actively opposing its practice. Halakhic considerations Halakha forbids the mistreatment of a convert, including reminding a convert that he or she was once not a Jew. Hence, little to no distinction is made in Judaism between those who are born Jewish and those who are Jewish as a result of conversion. However, despite Halakha protecting the rights of converts, some Jewish communities have been accused of treating converts as second-class Jews. For example, many communities of Syrian Jews have banned conversion and refuse to recognise any Jewish conversion, including those done under Orthodox auspices (possibly influenced by sects in Syria like the Druze which do not accept converts). According to Orthodox interpretations of Halakha, converts face a limited number of restrictions. A marriage between a female convert and a kohen (members of the priestly class) is prohibited and any children of the union do not inherit their father's kohen status. While a Jew by birth may not marry a mamzer, a convert can.Lindemann vs. Myers Converts can become rabbis. For instance, Rabbi Meir Baal Ha Nes is thought to be a descendant of a proselyte. Rabbi Akiva was also a very well known son of converts. The Talmud lists many of the Jewish nation's greatest leaders who had either descended from or were themselves converts. In fact, King David is descended from Ruth, a convert to Judaism.() In Orthodox and Conservative communities which maintain tribal distinctions, converts become Yisraelim (Israelites), ordinary Jews with no tribal or inter-Jewish distinctions. Converts typically follow the customs of their congregations. So a convert who prays at a Sephardi synagogue would follow Sephardi customs and learn Sephardi Hebrew. A convert chooses his or her own Hebrew first name upon conversion but is traditionally known as the son or daughter of Abraham and Sarah, the first patriarch and matriarch in the Torah, often with the additional qualifier of \\"Avinu\\" (our father) and \\"Imenu\\" (our mother). Hence, a convert named Akiva would be known, for ritual purposes in a synagogue, as \\"Akiva ben Avraham Avinu\\"; in cases where the mother's name is used, such as for the prayer for recovery from an illness, he would be known as \\"Akiva ben Sarah Imenu\\". Talmudic opinions on converts are numerous; some positive, some negative. A quote from the Talmud labels the convert \\"hard on Israel as a scab\\". Many interpretations explain this quote as meaning converts can be unobservant and lead Jews to be unobservant, or converts can be so observant that born Jews feel ashamed.Daf Yomi Jews by choice The term \\"Jew by choice\\" is often used to describe someone who, with no ancestral connection to the Jewish people, chose to convert to Judaism. It is often contrasted with such terms as \\"Jew by birth\\" (or \\"Jew by chance\\"). The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may \\"wander among nations\\" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a \\"lost\\" Jewish ancestor.Jewish Tales of Reincarnation', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 January 2000 Bnei Anusim In recent decades, there has been a renewed Jewish conversion interest with some Bnei Anusim, that is, the descendants of Jews who were forced to convert to other faiths. The Hebrew term for forced converts is \\"Anusim\\" (lit. \\"[the] forced [converts]\\"), while the descendants of said converts are called \\"Bnei Anusim\\" (lit. \\"[the] children [of the] forced [converts]\\"). In the modern era, the single most notable and numerous group of Bnei Anusim converts are the Sephardic Bnei Anusim, descendants of those Sephardic Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity during the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition. They are found throughout Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Iberoamerica (the Hispanic countries of the Americas plus Brazil). There has been a continuous steady growth among them who are now prospective converts, actively seeking conversions back to Judaism. Since many Bnei Anusim (i.e. descendants of forced converts) lack an unbroken matrilineal Jewish line of descent or lack satisfactory documentary evidence to that effect (even if they can prove Jewish ancestry along one or all other of their lineages besides their direct matrilineal lineage), conversion has been a growing option for them to return to Judaism.

Born at Pigna, in Liguria, Fea studied law in Rome, receiving the degree of doctor of laws from the university of La Sapienza, but archaeology gradually attracted his attention, and with the view of obtaining better opportunities for his research in 1798 he took Holy Orders and became an Abbott. For political reasons he was forced to take refuge in Florence; on his return to Rome in 1799 he was imprisoned as a Jacobin by the Neapolitans, who at that time were occupying Rome, but was shortly afterwards freed and appointed Commissario delle Antichit√† and librarian to Prince Sigismondo Chigi. At Rome in 1781 Fea discovered a statue of a discus thrower, the so- called \\"Discobolus\\", one of the known Roman copies of the famous Greek original statue in bronze created by Myron. Fea helped frame legislation to control the trade in, and excavation of, the antiquities of Rome, and undertook archaeological work on the Pantheon and the Forum there. Fea revised and annotated an Italian translation of Johann Joachim Winckelmann's Geschichte der Kunst, and also annotated some of the works of Giovanni Ludovico Bianconi. Among his original writings he is best known for: Miscellanea filologica, critica, e antiquaria; and Descrizione di Roma Antica e Moderna.* Despite being qualified to do so, Fea never used the title of Abbott but rather that of a lawyer (Avv). He died in Rome on the night of March 17, 1836, in the palazzo Chigi.

With headquarters in Lubbock, Texas, its roots go back to 1916, when H.D. Snell opened his first United Cash Store in Sayre, Oklahoma. Today, the chain has grown to include 95 stores in 30 Texas cities and over 10,000 workers. History United Supermarkets has 94 stores located in Texas and New Mexico. While it shares the same name as United Supermarkets based in Oklahoma, it technically does business as The United Family to differentiate from the Oklahoma chain, as they are separate grocery entities. Today, United Supermarkets is run by the Albertsons chain, and operates as a division of Albertsons. The United Family operates five distinct retail banners: * United Supermarket - traditional grocery offerings at a competitive price * Market Street - features take-home cuisine, restaurants, gourmet, and everyday grocery items in one store * Amigos United - an international-format store offering a blend of American fare and international cuisine * United Express - a wide variety of on-the-go food options, made-to-order barista specialty coffee and fast access to fuel * Albertsons Market - merges everyday convenience with innovative on-trend products They each share a single mission: deliver ultimate service, display superior performance and make a positive impact every single day. Dan J. Sanders, who became CEO in June 2004, published a book, Built to Serve, with McGraw-Hill in September 2007. Built to Serve is a management book that stresses the principles on which United was supposedly founded. It focuses on putting people before profits. The foreword was written by Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and the afterword was written by Ken Blanchard, author of The One Minute Manager. Dan stepped down in February 2010 and Robert Taylor was named CEO. On April 1, 2009, United opened its 50th store in Plano, Texas. On January 9, 2013, United opened its newest store in Lubbock. This new Market Street store is much larger and features a much wider selection of products and services. The purpose of this store was to replace an older United Supermarkets store and to be open 24 hours. Most United Supermarkets stores operate from 6 or 7 am until 11 pm, seven days a week. As of February 1, 2016, four stores operate 24 hours a day, including the pharmacy: two stores in Lubbock, one in Wichita Falls, and one in Frisco. Two stores were open 24 hours a day temporarily after the opening of the new store. Both were located in Lubbock. Acquisition On September 9, 2013, United Supermarkets LLC was sold to Albertsons LLC. On February 4, 2014, the FTC voted 4‚Äì0 to approve the deal. The acquisition deal cost Albertsons $385 million and required Albertsons to sell its single stores in the Amarillo and Wichita Falls, Texas, markets. As part of the acquisition, several Albertsons locations in Eastern New Mexico, which were re-branded as \\"Albertsons Market\\", were added to the new United division of Albertsons-Safeway. Expansion in New Mexico continued with the purchase of several Lawrence Brothers locations, and the transfer of stores in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, and Taos, to the United division.

History Delhaize Le Lion / De Leeuw was founded near Charleroi, Belgium, in 1867 by Jules Delhaize and his brothers Auguste, Edouard and Adolphe. He was helped in this endeavor by his future brother-in-law, Jules Vieujant. For their new company, they chose the lion, the symbol of strength, as their logo. They also chose a motto: unity is strength. In 2005, Delhaize Group completed the acquisition of the Belgium supermarket chain Cash Fresh for 118.6 million euros. Delhaize paid an additional 51 million euros to acquire real estate assets of Cash Fresh. As of 31 December 2014, Delhaize Group had a sales network (which includes directly operated, franchised, and affiliated stores) of 3,402 stores and employed approximately 150,000 people (excluding the stores and related associates of divested and discontinued operations).

Biography Charles Fellows was born at High Pavement, Nottingham on 31 August 1799, the fifth son of John Fellows, a wealthy silk merchant and banker, and his wife Sarah.Charles Fellows in \\"England and Wales Non-Conformist Record Indexes (RG4-8), 1588-1977\\", FamilySearch (Charles Fellows). When fourteen he drew sketches to illustrate a trip to the ruins of Newstead Abbey, which afterwards appeared on the title-page of Moore's Life of Lord Byron. In 1820 he settled in London, where he became an active member of the British Association. In 1827 he discovered the modern ascent of Mont Blanc. After the death of his mother in 1832 he passed the greater portion of his time in Italy, Greece and the Levant. The numerous sketches he executed were largely used in illustrating Childe Harold. In 1838 he went to Asia Minor, making Smyrna his headquarters. His explorations in the interior and the south led him to districts practically unknown to Europeans, and he thus discovered ruins of a number of ancient cities. He entered Lycia and explored the Xanthus from the mouth at Patara upwards. Nine miles from Patara he discovered the ruins of Xanthus, the ancient capital of Lycia, finely situated on hills, and abounding in magnificent remains. About 15 miles farther up he came upon the ruins of Tlos. After taking sketches of the most interesting objects and copying a number of inscriptions, he returned to Smyrna through Caria and Lydia. The publication in 1839 of A Journal written during an Excursion in Asia Minor roused such interest that Lord Palmerston, at the request of the British Museum authorities, asked the British consul at Constantinople to obtain a firman from the sultan to export a number of the Lycian works of art to England. Expedition to Lycia Map of Part of Asia Minor illustrating the Journal of Charles Fellows, 1838 (1839) Having obtained the firman, Fellows, under the auspices of the British Museum, again set out for Lycia in late 1839. He was accompanied by the painter George Scharf, who assisted him by sketching the expedition. This second visit resulted in the discovery of thirteen ancient cities, chief among them Xanthos. He made a further trip in 1841. Fellows led the archaeological excavation of Xanthos and other Lycian cities in Asia Minor and shipped an enormous amount of antique monuments to England, where they may be seen today in the halls of the British Museum. They include reliefs from the Harpy Tomb and the Nereid Monument, amongst many others. In 1841, he published An Account of Discoveries in Lycia, being a Journal kept during a Second Excursion in Asia Minor. Three years later he presented to the British Museum his portfolios, accounts of his expeditions, and specimens of natural history illustrative of Lycia. In 1845, he was knighted as an acknowledgment of his services in the removal of the Xanthian antiquities to Britain. Fellows paid his own expenses in all his journeys and received no financial reward for his endeavours. Personal life The grave of Sir Charles Fellows, Highgate Cemetery, London Fellows was married twice. He died in London in 1860 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, London.

Microsoft first released Entourage in October 2000 as part of the Microsoft Office 2001 office suite; Office 98, the previous version of Microsoft Office for the classic Mac OS included Outlook Express 5. The last version was Entourage: Mac 2008, part of Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, released on January 15, 2008. Entourage was replaced by Outlook for Macintosh in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, released on October 26, 2010. Overview My Day, a mini schedule Entourage provided email, calendar, address book, task list, note list, and project manager functionality. With Entourage 2004, Microsoft began offering a Project Center, which allowed the user to create and organize projects. Information may come from within Entourage or outside the program. Entourage supported retrieving email using POP, IMAP, and (for Microsoft Exchange servers) WebDAV. Entourage 2008 featured a new \\"My Day\\" utility, which assists in organizing one's day, and cites (in the welcome message) improvements to search speed, \\"to do\\" flags, improved junk mail and phishing protection, as well as quick navigation via favorites and customizable toolbars. Features Entourage supported some Mac OS technologies, like the Spotlight search engine and AppleScript; however, the use of a monolithic database made it difficult to back up incrementally with Time Machine. Entourage also maintained a separate address book, but allowed synchronization of contacts and calendar events through Sync Services. Comparison to Outlook Unlike the other applications in the Mac version of the Microsoft Office suite, Entourage did not share a name with its Microsoft Windows counterpart. Microsoft claimed that Entourage was intended \\"to address an entirely different audience\\". Entourage had its origins in Outlook Express 5 on the Mac, as well as Claris Emailer and contained \\"no ported code, and no Office code\\". Nevertheless, Microsoft has positioned Entourage as a \\"similar\\" product for Macintosh customers on Exchange servers. As a client for Microsoft Exchange Entourage had included support for Microsoft Exchange servers since August 4, 2003, when the Exchange Update for Entourage X was released. This early release required the use of IMAP for mail connectivity and WebDAV for address and calendar functionality. (Subsequent versions have dropped the requirement for IMAP and rely solely on WebDAV.) Users complained of the lack of a variety of functions present in Outlook for Windows and Outlook 2001. Subsequent versions of Entourage added some of the missing functionality. However, full parity with Outlook as an Exchange client was never available in Entourage 2008. Synchronization of tasks and notes with an Exchange server was not available. Many Exchange users have been vocal in denouncing Microsoft's omission of these features. Microsoft claimed to have prioritized \\"reliability\\" over expanded Exchange support in Entourage 2008. One major shortcoming of Entourage was its inability to handle complex HTML. While messages could be received and viewed correctly, they could not be forwarded without all formatting being stripped out. As an example, an airline confirmation received from, say, Imaginary Airlines, could not be forwarded without all of the pictorial information being reduced to links, rendering the e-mail unreadable. A workaround for this was to choose \\"Forward as attachment\\" which forwarded the message as a message/rfc822 file, and preserved complex HTML formatting. An additional limitation was the inability to attach what is referred to as an \\"Item\\" in Outlook to a message while it was being composed since there was no menu choice to allow this. Instead, a user needed to find the item to be forwarded, i.e., a Contact, select it, then choose Forward as vCard from the menu. It was also not possible to create or manage server side rules on the Exchange server, so filtering only worked when the Entourage application was running. Limitations Entourage could not natively read Outlook Personal Folder files and could not read Outlook archived emails without first re-importing them back into the main Windows Outlook database. As a result, it was impossible to directly transfer email data from Outlook (Windows) into Entourage (Mac). Although Microsoft had released a PST Import Tool for Entourage, this did not directly solve the problem of exporting data from Windows to Mac, because this utility could only import PST files from Outlook 2001 for the Mac. One could import a Windows Outlook 2000 compatible PST to Mac Outlook 2001, and then use the utility to import into Entourage. To address this, Microsoft made Mac Outlook 2001 available for free download. This wasn't a solution for all Mac users, because Outlook 2001 only runs in the Classic Environment, which cannot run in OS 10.5 or on any Intel Macs. Outlook for Office 2011 for Intel Macs, is able to import Outlook .pst files from Windows; however, data will be stored as many individual files, rather than in a single database such as .pst or the Entourage database. Macworld indicates that Windows Outlook messages can be transferred to Apple Mail or Entourage by using Mozilla Thunderbird as an intermediate agent. Thunderbird on Windows is used to import the mail from Outlook. Then the converted mail file is moved from the Windows Thunderbird directory to the Mac and the import feature is used on Mac Mail or Entourage. However, message attachments will be lost in the conversion to Thunderbird. Commercial third-party software (e.g. Emailchemy) is available to facilitate the transfer of Outlook data to Entourage. But those using the mbox format will not be able to respect any subfolder hierarchy since the mbox format doesn't support it. Other alternative solutions include synchronizing: to an iPod Touch or iPhone through iTunes; using Apple MobileMe service; using an IMAP-enabled email provider; using a Microsoft Exchange server.

It allows images to be printed directly from digital cameras to a printer, without having to connect the camera to a computer. Its formal name is \\"Standard of Camera & Imaging Products Association CIPA DC-001 ‚Äî 2003 Digital Solutions for Imaging Devices\\". CIPA DC-001-2003 Rev. 2.0 has been published in 2007. PictBridge is typically implemented using USB ports and the USB protocol. PictBridge-capable printers typically have a USB type A port which is connected by cable to the USB port of a PictBridge-capable digital camera (typically a Mini-B). The user selects the images on the camera to print. PictBridge and free open source software PictBridge arguably does not qualify as an open standard, as the specification can only be obtained from CIPA after agreement not to disclose any information from the specification to others (section 2.2 of the agreementhttp://www.cipa.jp/pictbridge/documents_e/ObtainingStandard_E.pdf). In practice, this means that PictBridge cannot be implemented as free software or open source software, other than by reverse-engineering the protocol (perhaps aided by the white paper that CIPA provideshttp://www.cipa.jp/pictbridge/documents_e/WhitePaperE_Rev.2.0.pdf), if publishing source code of an implementation of the PictBridge standard is considered to count as \\"disclosing information\\" from the specification. A printer may implement functions similar to a PictBridge printer without the non-disclosure agreement merely by treating the camera's memory as a USB mass storage device, although the user interface for image selection would necessarily be on the printer rather than the camera in this case.

Origins Undaunted by the Swedish defeats and failures during 1789, the Swedish king, Gustav III sent the battlefleet under his brother Prince Karl, Duke of S√∂dermanland, to eliminate Admiral Chichagov's Russian squadron, which had wintered in the harbour at Reval. General-Admiral Duke Karl approached Reval with 26 ships of the line and large frigates mounting a combined 1,680 cannon. Chichagov, preparing to meet the enemy in the harbour, formed a battle line made up of 9 ships of the line and the frigate Venus. Battle The Russian fleet (9 ships of the line, 5 frigates) was anchored in a line going from Reval harbour towards the Viimsi (Wims) peninsula. The first line consisted of nine ships of the line and frigates (the 100-gun battleships Rostislav and Saratov, 74-gun Kir Ioann, Mstislav, Sv. Yelena and Yaroslav, 66-gun Pobedonosets, Boleslav and Izyaslav and the 40-gun frigate Venus). In the second line, four frigates - Podrazhislav (32 guns), Slava (32), Nadezhda Blagopoluchiya (32) and Pryamislav (36). Two bomb-vessels were deployed on the flanks. The third line was composed of seven launches. The Swedish fleet under the command of General-Admiral Duke Karl of S√∂dermanland consisted of 22 ships of the line, four frigates and four smaller vessels. It entered the harbour and started passing by the anchored Russian ships. Due to strong winds and inaccurate aiming, most Swedish projectiles ricocheted past their targets, while the Russian ships that were anchored within the protected area of the harbour were able to use their guns much more effectively. The ship of the Swedish General-Admiral, which could not be brought into the wind due to a rigging problem, was forced to drift towards Rostislav and received major damage from grapeshot. The 64-gun battleship Prins Karl, fifteenth the Swedish line, lost her rudder to Russian fire and had to strike her colours. The Duke of S√∂dermanland directed the battle from the frigate Ulla Fersen, beyond the range of Russian fire. After a two-hour artillery duel he ordered his ships to break off the engagement; hence the last ten ships of Swedish line veered off without firing a shot. The Swedish ship Riksens St√§nder hit the reef north of Aegna (Wolf) island. Swedish attempts to dislodge her failed, and the Swedes were forced to burn her so that the Russians would be unable to take her. Aftermath The Battle of Reval was a resounding Russian victory. The Swedes lost two ships of the line, and were forced to retreat despite their almost twofold numerical superiority. Swedish losses were 51 killed, 81 wounded, and 250 captured. Russian losses were 8 killed and 27 injured. Contemporary sources reported Russian casualties of 4 killed, 7 seriously and 18 lightly wounded, with almost 400 Swedish sailors, soldiers and officers captured and presumably 130 killed. After the battle the Swedish fleet partially repaired at the sea, and then sailed away east of Hogland Island.

Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time. Climate During the Late Cretaceous, the climate was warmer than present, although throughout the period a cooling trend is evident. The tropics became restricted to equatorial regions and northern latitudes experienced markedly more seasonal climatic conditions. Geography Late Cretaceous Map (Turonian) Due to plate tectonics, the Americas were gradually moving westward, causing the Atlantic Ocean to expand. The Western Interior Seaway divided North America into eastern and western halves; Appalachia and Laramidia. India maintained a northward course towards Asia. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia and Antarctica seem to have remained connected and began to drift away from Africa and South America.\\"Dinosaurs Ruled the World: Late Cretaceous Period.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. Pp. 103-104. . Europe was an island chain. Populating some of these islands were endemic dwarf dinosaur species. Vertebrate fauna Non-Avian Dinosaurs In the Late Cretaceous, the hadrosaurs, ankylosaurs, and ceratopsians experienced success in Asiamerica (Western North America and eastern Asia). Tyrannosaurs dominated the large predator niche in North America. They were also present in Asia, although were usually smaller and more primitive than the North American varieties. Pachycephalosaurs were also present in both North America and Asia. Dromaeosaurs shared the same geographical distribution, and are well documented in both Mongolia and Western North America. Additionally therizinosaurs (known previously as segnosaurs) appear to have been in North America and Asia. Gondwana held a very different dinosaurian fauna, with most predators being abelisaurs and carcharodontosaurs; and titanosaurs being among the dominant herbivores. Spinosaurids were also present during this time. Birds Birds became increasingly common, diversifying in a variety of enantiornithe and ornithurine forms. Early Neornithes such as Vegavis co- existed with forms as bizarre as Yungavolucris and Avisaurus. Though mostly small, marine Hesperornithes became relatively large and flightless, adapted to life in the open sea. Pterosaurs Though primarily represented by azhdarchids, other forms like pteranodontids, tapejarids (Caiuajara and Bakonydraco), nyctosaurids and uncertain forms (Piksi, Navajodactylus) are also present. Historically, it has been assumed that pterosaurs were in decline due to competition with birds, but it appears that neither group overlapped significantly ecologically, nor is it particularly evident that a true systematic decline was ever in place, especially with the discovery of smaller pterosaur species. Mammals Several old mammal groups began to disappear, with the last eutriconodonts occurring in the Campanian of North America. In the northern hemisphere, cimolodont, multituberculates, metatherians and eutherians were the dominant mammals, with the former two groups being the most common mammals in North America. In the southern hemisphere there was instead a more complex fauna of dryolestoids, gondwanatheres and other multituberculates and basal eutherians; monotremes were presumably present, as was the last of the haramiyidans, Avashishta. Mammals, though generally small, ranged into a variety of ecological niches, from carnivores (Deltatheroida), to mollusc-eater (Stagodontidae), to herbivores (multituberculates, Schowalteria, Zhelestidae and Mesungulatidae) to highly atypical cursorial forms (Zalambdalestidae, Brandoniidae). True placentals only evolved at the very end of the epoch; the same can be said for true marsupials. Instead, nearly all known eutherian and metatherian fossils belong to other groups. Marine life In the seas, mosasaurs suddenly appeared and underwent a spectacular evolutionary radiation. Modern sharks also appeared and giant-penguin-like polycotylid plesiosaurs (3 meters long) and huge long-necked elasmosaurs (13 meters long) also diversified. These predators fed on the numerous teleost fishes, which in turn evolved into new advanced and modern forms (Neoteleostei). Ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, on the other hand, became extinct during the Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event. Flora Near the end of the Cretaceous Period, flowering plants diversified. In temperate regions, familiar plants like magnolias, sassafras, roses, redwoods, and willows could be found in abundance. Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene mass extinction The Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time, approximately (Ma). It is widely known as the K‚ÄìT extinction event and is associated with a geological signature, usually a thin band dated to that time and found in various parts of the world, known as the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìT boundary). K is the traditional abbreviation for the Cretaceous Period derived from the German name Kreidezeit, and T is the abbreviation for the Tertiary Period (a historical term for the period of time now covered by the Paleogene and Neogene periods). The event marks the end of the Mesozoic Era and the beginning of the Cenozoic Era. \\"Tertiary\\" being no longer recognized as a formal time or rock unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the K-T event is now called the Cretaceous‚ÄîPaleogene (or K-Pg) extinction event by many researchers. Asteroids of only a few kilometers wide can release the energy of millions of nuclear weapons when colliding with planets (artist's impression). Non-avian dinosaur fossils are only found below the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary and became extinct immediately before or during the event. A very small number of dinosaur fossils have been found above the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary, but they have been explained as reworked fossils, that is, fossils that have been eroded from their original locations then preserved in later sedimentary layers. Mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs and many species of plants and invertebrates also became extinct. Mammalian and bird clades passed through the boundary with few extinctions, and evolutionary radiation from those Maastrichtian clades occurred well past the boundary. Rates of extinction and radiation varied across different clades of organisms. Many scientists hypothesize that the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinctions were caused by catastrophic events such as the massive asteroid impact that caused the Chicxulub crater, in combination with increased volcanic activity, such as that recorded in the Deccan Traps, both of which have been firmly dated to the time of the extinction event. In theory, these events reduced sunlight and hindered photosynthesis, leading to a massive disruption in Earth's ecology. A much smaller number of researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in sea level or climate.

The tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium - the space between the blood vessels - made up of intraglomerular mesangial cells. The blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier, which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule. The filtrate then enters the renal tubule of the nephron. The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. The glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman's capsule constitute a renal corpuscle, the basic filtration unit of the kidney. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall kidney function, is the glomerular filtration rate. Structure Renal corpuscle showing glomerulus and glomerular capillaries. Figure 2: (a) Diagram of the juxtaglomerular apparatus: it has specialized cells working as a unit which monitor the sodiujuxtaglomerular apparatus: it has three types of specm content of the fluid in the distal convoluted tubule (not labelled - it's the tubule on the left) and adjust the glomerular filtration rate and the rate of renin release. (b) Micrograph showing the glomerulus and surrounding structures. The glomerulus is a tuft of small blood vessels called capillaries located within Bowman's capsule within the kidney. Glomerular mesangial cells structurally support the tufts. Blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an afferent arteriole and leaves by an efferent arteriole. The capillaries consist of a tube lined by endothelial cells with a central lumen. The gaps between these endothelial cells are called fenestrae. The walls have a unique structure: there are pores between the cells that allow water and soluble substances to exit, and after passing through the glomerular basement membrane, and between podocyte foot processes, enter the capsule as ultrafiltrate. Lining Scanning electron microscope view of the inner surface of an opened (broken) capillary with fenestrae visible.(100,000x magnification) Capillaries of the glomerulus are lined by endothelial cells. These contain numerous pores - also called fenestrae - 50‚Äì100 nm in diameter. Unlike those of other capillaries with fenestrations, these fenestrations are not spanned by diaphragms. They allow for the filtration of fluid, blood plasma solutes and protein, at the same time preventing the filtration of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The glomerulus has a glomerular basement membrane consisting mainly of laminins, type IV collagen, agrin and nidogen, which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes: thus the glomerular basement membrane is sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes. The glomerular baement membrane is 250‚Äì400 nm in thickness, which is thicker than basement membranes of other tissue. It is a barrier to blood proteins such as albumin and globulin. The part of the podocyte in contact with the glomerular basement membrane is called a podocyte foot process or pedicle (Fig. 3): there are gaps between the foot processes through which the filtrate flows into Bowman's space of the capsule. . The space between adjacent podocyte foot processes is spanned by slit diaphragms consisting of a mat of proteins, including podocin and nephrin. In addition, foot processes have a negatively charged coat (glycocalyx) that repels negatively charged molecules such as serum albumin. Mesangium The mesangium is a space which is continuous with the smooth muscles of the arterioles. It is outside the capillary lumen, but surrounded by capillaries. It is in the middle (meso) between the capillaries (angis). It is contained by the basement membrane, which surrounds both the capillaries and the mesangium. The mesangium contains mainly: *Intraglomerular mesangial cells. They are not part of the filtration barrier but are specialized pericytes that participate in the regulation of the filtration rate by contracting or expanding: they contain actin and myosin filaments to accomplish this. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two- way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate. *Mesangial matrix, an amorphous basement membrane-like material secreted by the mesangial cells. Blood supply Diagram of the circulation related to a single glomerulus, associated tubule, and collecting system. The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an efferent arteriole instead of a venule, as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. 4). This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular smooth muscle layer (tunica media). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal venule, which in turn enters a renal interlobular vein and then into the renal vein. Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the vasa recta, which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the renal medulla. These vasa recta run adjacent to the descending and ascending loop of Henle, and participate in the maintenance of the medullary countercurrent exchange system. Filtrate drainage The filtrate that has passed through the three-layered filtration unit enters Bowman's space. From there, it flows into the renal tubule - the nephron - which follows a U-shaped path to the collecting ducts, finally exiting into a renal calyx as urine. Function Filtration thumb350pxScheme of filtration barrier (blood- urine) in the kidney. A. The endothelial cells of the glomerulus; 1. pore (fenestra). B. Glomerular basement membrane: 1. lamina rara interna 2. lamina densa 3. lamina rara externa C. Podocytes: 1. enzymatic and structural proteins 2. filtration slit 3. diaphragma The main function of the glomerulus is to filter plasma to produce glomerular filtrate, which passes down the length of the nephron tubule to form urine. The rate at which the glomerulus produces filtrate from plasma (the glomerular filtration rate) is much higher than in systemic capillaries because of the particular anatomical characteristics of the glomerulus. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high hydrostatic pressure on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favour filtration to the Bowman's capsule. If a substance has passed through the glomerular capillary endothelial cells, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes, then it enters the lumen of the tubule and is known as glomerular filtrate. Otherwise, it exits the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and continues circulation as discussed below and as shown on the picture. =Permeability= The structures of the layers determine their permeability-selectivity (permselectivity). The factors that influence permselectivity are the negative charge of the basement membrane and the podocytic epithelium, and the effective pore size of the glomerular wall (8 nm). As a result, large and/or negatively charged molecules will pass through far less frequently than small and/or positively charged ones. For instance, small ions such as sodium and potassium pass freely, while larger proteins, such as hemoglobin and albumin have practically no permeability at all. The oncotic pressure on glomerular capillaries is one of the forces that resist filtration. Because large and negatively charged proteins have a low permeability, they cannot filtrate easily to the Bowman's capsule. Therefore, the concentration of these proteins tends to increase as the glomerular capillaries filtrate plasma, increasing the oncotic pressure along the length of a glomerular capillary. =Starling equation= The rate of filtration from the glomerulus to the Bowman's capsule is determined (as in systemic capillaries) by the Starling equation: :\\\\ GFR = K_\\\\mathrm{f} [ (P_\\\\mathrm{gc} - P_\\\\mathrm{bc}) - (\\\\pi_\\\\mathrm{gc} - \\\\pi_\\\\mathrm{bc}) ] * GFR is the glomerular filtration rate. * Kf is the filtration coefficient ‚Äì a proportionality constant * Pgc is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure * Pbc is the Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure * œÄgc is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure * œÄbc is the Bowman's capsule oncotic pressure Regulation of blood pressure The walls of the afferent arteriole contain specialized smooth muscle cells that synthesize renin. These juxtaglomerular cells play a major role in the renin‚Äìangiotensin system, which helps regulate blood volume and pressure. Clinical significance Damage to the glomerulus by disease can allow passage through the glomerular filtration barrier of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood proteins such as albumin and globulin. Underlying causes for glomerular injury can be inflammatory, toxic or metabolic. These can be seen in the urine (urinalysis) on microscopic and chemical (dipstick) examination. Examples are diabetic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, and IgA nephropathy. Due to the connection between the glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate, the glomerular filtration rate is of clinical significance when suspecting a kidney disease, or when following up a case with known kidney disease, or when risking a development of renal damage such as beginning medications with known nephrotoxicity.Gerard J. Tortora, Bryan Derrickson Principles of Anatomy and Physiology 14th ed . History In 1666, Italian biologist and anatomist Marcello Malpighi first described the glomeruli and demonstrated their continuity with the renal vasculature (281,282). About 175 years later, surgeon and anatomist William Bowman elucidated in detail the capillary architecture of the glomerulus and the continuity between its surrounding capsule and the proximal tubule.\\"lippicotts histology for pathologesits; satcey e. mills Additional images File:Glomerulum of mouse kidney in Scanning Electron Microscope, magnification 1,000x.GIFScanning electron microscope image of a glomerulus in a mouse (1000x magnification) File:Glomerulum of mouse kidney in Scanning Electron Microscope, magnification 5,000x.GIFScanning electron microscope image of a glomerulus in a mouse (5000x magnification) File:Glomerulum of mouse kidney with broken capillary in Scanning Electron Microscope, magnification 10,000x.GIFScanning electron microscope image of a glomerulus in a mouse (10,000x magnification) File:Glomerular Physiology.pngLooped capillaries of glomerulus between the arterioles  References  Sources * * Category:Kidney anatomy ","title":"Glomerulus (kidney)"},{"id":"648440","text":"Sir John Evans (17 November 1823 ‚Äì 31 May 1908) was an English archaeologist and geologist. Biography John Evans, son of the Rev. A. B. Evans, was born at Britwell Court, Buckinghamshire. At the age of seventeen he started to work for the paper-manufacturing business of John Dickinson & Co. Ltd at Nash Mills (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire). The company had been founded by his uncle and later father-in-law John Dickinson (1782‚Äì1869), who was also its senior partner. In 1850 Evans was admitted as a partner in the company and did not retire from active management until 1885. Apart from his managerial work John Evans was also a distinguished antiquary, archaeologist and numismatist. He was president of the following societies and institutions: * The Society of Antiquaries, from 1885 to 1892. * The Royal Numismatic Society, from 1874 to the time of his death. * The Geological Society of London, from 1874 to 1876. * The Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, from 1877‚Äì1879. * The Society of Chemical Industry, from 1891 to 1893. * The British Association for the Advancement of Science, from 1897 to 1898. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1864 and for twenty years (1878‚Äì1898) he was treasurer of the Royal Society. He was appointed High Sheriff of Hertfordshire for 1881.Sir John Evans: Learned Societies and Awards . University of Oxford, Ashmolean Museum, 2009 As President of the Society of Antiquaries he was an ex officio trustee of the British Museum and subsequently he became a permanent trustee.

The town, France's most southwesterly and a popular seaside tourist resort, stands on the right bank of the River Bidassoa ‚Äì which marks the Franco-Spanish border ‚Äì at the point where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean in the French Basque Country. Hendaye has three distinguishable parts: la ville (the town), which stretches from Saint Vincent's church to the area around the SNCF railway station and the industrial zone; la plage (the beach), the seaside quarter; and les hauteurs (the heights), the villas and camping sites on the hills between and behind the other two areas. History 18th century depiction of the Bay of Txingudi, below Hendaye, and above Hondarribia (in Spain) Hendaye acquired its independence from the Urrugne parish in 1598, when Saint Vincent's church was built. In the Franco-Spanish War, the town was briefly occupied by the Spanish, in September 1636. On the fortified √éle des Faisans (Pheasant Island) in the river, the Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed in 1659, ending decades of intermittent war between France and Spain. Authority over the island alternates between France and Spain every six months. All the same, the village kept being subject to destruction due to cross-border military activity. In the War of the Pyrenees (1793-1795), the village was levelled to the ground, as described in 1799 by Wilhelm von Humboldt: \\"The settlement spreads over a rather wide area, and seems to have looked clean and pleasant time ago. Currently all the houses, but for a handful of them, lie destroyed. The empty walls can barely stand, while the ground before inhabited is covered with overgrown bush and hawthorn. Ivy creeps up the walls, out of crumbling windows the desolate ocean can be seen through the room. Shells can still be come across the street here and there, but hardly ever can one bump into a person. Most of the inhabitants either perished in the danger and helplessness of the runaway, or they scattered away to other places.\\" The abolition of the French provinces, the War of the Pyrenees and the end of Basque home rule in the Spanish Basque districts--customs on the Ebro river moved to the Pyrenees (1841)--broke definitely the fluent cross-border trade and natural coexistence of the Basque speaking communities around the lower Bidassoa and the Bay of Txingudi, divided as of then by a restricted Spanish-French border. On 22 October 1863, the railway arrived in Hendaye, as the track on the Spanish side also approached the Bidassoa borderline. On 15 August 1864, the first Madrid- Paris train arrived in Hendaye, forever re-shaping the human and urban landscape of the village and prompting rapid development.Arrival of the railway to Hendaye, in Histoires de Hendaye Hendaye started to stand out as an international hub and a seaside resort for the elites after the model of Biarritz (1854), halfway between Donostia (San Sebasti√°n) and Biarritz. In 1913, the Spanish Basque railway serving the coastline all the way to Donostia (later known as \\"topo\\", the 'mole') arrived at Hendaye Gare. On 23 October 1940, Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er, Francisco Franco, Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop met in the Hendaye railway station (then in German-occupied France) to discuss Spain's participation in World War II as part of the Axis. Sights Les Jumeaux The town square, where there is a weekly open-air market on Wednesdays, is the location of the famous seventeenth century \\"Great Cross of Hendaye\\", a stone cross carved with alchemical symbols that occultists find to contain encrypted information on a future global catastrophe. The church of Saint-Vincent was built in 1598, and largely reconstructed over the centuries following fires and bombardments. Its most recent transformation was finished in 1968. The 13th-century crucifix is the principal treasure. The ruins of the early seventeenth century fortifications, which were reinforced by Vauban in 1685, and the old cannons facing Hondarribia, are one of the features of the promenade along the Bay of Txingudi waterfront. The seafront Ch√¢teau of Antoine d'Abbadie, built by the architect and theorist Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc is a monument of the Gothic Revival. The Casino building, of Neo-Moorish style, was built in 1885. It used to be occupied by a casino (hence the name), until it was moved to the quartier de Sokoburu. During the First World War, it served as a military hospital for French soldiers and then as the Portuguese Military Hospital of Hendaia, from 15 June 1918 to 23 February 1919. The picturesque old fishing port of Caneta has views over the Bay of Txingudi to Hondarribia and the Jaizkibel, and is also the site of Pierre Loti's house and the old customs building. The Jumeaux rocks (Dunbarriak in Basque, literally 'the bell stones') have become somewhat emblematic to Hendaye. These two high rock stacks, which have been carved out of the cliffs by wave action, are visible from the beach or from the domaine d'Abbadia, a nature park on the edge of the commune related to the Conservatoire du littoral project. The Abbadia domain : the castle seen from the surroundings meadows Culture Music Hendaye doesn't have any specific music venues, but there are many places where bands can play. The covered pelota fronton at Belcenia has a high capacity and the basque folk band Oskorri have played here on more than one occasion. In summer, bigger bands can play in open air at the Hendaye Plage Rugby pitch. Toure Kunda, among others, have played here. Concerts can be organised in the Cin√©ma les Vari√©t√©s, which also has a high capacity. The closed market is a good place for starting-out local bands to stage small concerts. Rather than a pub scene, local bands often play in Hendaye's many campsites in the summer. The Lanetik Egina music club is the hub of Hendaye's music scene. It has a very good reputation and organises regular concerts. It is also a place where musicians of all ages can meet up and form bands. Perhaps the most successful band to come from Hendaye is the basque ska-punk band Skunk, who have made many albums. Theatre and performance The Cin√©ma les Vari√©t√©s is a large classic theatre and cinema, which is a regular venue for theatre, dancing, and performance arts. There is also a cinema at Sokoburu, near the quartier de la Plage, called the Salle Antoine d'Abbadie, but it is only used on special occasions. The Th√©√¢tre des Chim√®res, from Biarritz, regularly perform at Hendaye. Art and literature The M√©diath√®que municipale Fran√ßois Mitterrand is a public library offering books, magazines, films, and CDs. There is also an art gallery, which is the main one for Hendaye. Events These a few of the regular festivals in Hendaye: ;January *Bixintxo (St Vincent) ;May *Mai du th√©√¢tre (theatre festival throughout the month) ;June *F√™te du cidre (cider festival) *F√™te de la musique (music festival) ;July *F√™te de la Mer (festival of the Sea) ;August *F√™te Basque (basque festival) Gastronomy Most of the town's restaurants are found in the quartier de la Plage and along the Bay of Txingudi waterfront. Hendaye is locally well known for the quality of its txurros. Transport The town is an important railway junction, as Spain's mainline trains use a broader gauge than continental Europe, with the French railway network finishing here on the banks of the Bidasoa. As well as the Gare d'Hendaye, there is also a station serving the beach quarter (Hendaye Plage) prior to the terminus, called the Gare des Deux-Jumeaux. Basque rapid transit system Metro Donostialdea linking the town to Donostia-San Sebasti√°n gets right to Hendaye, by the SNCF station. There has been recent controversy concerning the new LGV Sud Europe Atlantique (TGV line), which is planned to pass inland of Hendaye without stopping in or anywhere near the town itself. Most of the local population, along with that of the rest of the C√¥te Basque, are in favour of the TGV, but against the new line, which would destroy the surrounding countryside, bypassing the town completely. It has therefore been suggested to upgrade the present line to make it suitable for the TGV, with a stop at Hendaye station. It is argued that this would also be much less expensive, and would stimulate the local economy. Agglomeration The commune of Biriatou to the south is the only other official member of the urban area. However, B√©hobie, a quartier of Urrugne, situated between the communes of Hendaye and Biriatou, is generally regarded as a much more significant part of the agglomeration. Twin towns - sister cities Hendaye is twinned with: * Arguedas, Spain * Peebles, Scotland, United Kingdom * Viana do Castelo, Portugal  Notable people  *Pierre Loti lived and died here (1894-1923).

Qever Ra·∏•el, Qabr RƒÅ·∏•ƒ´l) is the site revered as the burial place of the matriarch Rachel. The tomb is considered holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims.: ‚ÄúRather than being content with half a dozen or even a full dozen witnesses, we have tried to compile as many sources as possible. During the Roman and Byzantine era, when Christians dominated there was really not much attention given to Rachel‚Äôs Tomb in Bethlehem. It was only when the Muslims took control that the shrine became an important site. Yet it was rarely considered a shrine exclusive to one religion. To be sure, most of the witnesses were Christian, yet there were also Jewish and Muslim visitors to the tomb. Equally important, the Christian witnesses call attention to the devotion shown to the shrine throughout much of this period by local Muslims and then later also by Jews. As far as the building itself, it appears to be a cooperative venture. There is absolutely no evidence of a pillar erected by Jacob. The earliest form of the structure was that of a pyramid typical of Roman period architecture. Improvements were made first by Crusader Christians a thousand years later, then Muslims in several stages, and finally by the Jewish philanthropist Moses Montefiore in the nineteenth century. If there is one lesson to be learned, it is that this is a shrine held in esteem equally by Jews, Muslims, and Christians. As far as authenticity we are on shaky ground. It may be that the current shrine has physical roots in the biblical era. However, the evidence points to the appropriation of a tomb from the Herod family. If there was a memorial to Rachel in Bethlehem during the late biblical era, it was likely not at the current site of Rachel‚Äôs Tomb.‚Äù The site is also referred to as the Bilal bin Rabah mosque () The tomb, located at the northern entrance of Bethlehem, is built in the style of a traditional maqam. The burial place of the matriarch Rachel as mentioned in the Jewish Tanakh, the Christian Old Testament and in Muslim literature is contested between this site and several others to the north. Although this site is considered unlikely to be the actual site of the grave, it is by far the most recognized candidate. The earliest extra-biblical records describing this tomb as Rachel's burial place date to the first decades of the 4th century CE. The structure in its current form dates from the Ottoman period, and is situated in a Christian and Muslim cemetery dating from at least the Mamluk period.Bowman, 2015, p.34: \\"Jachintus‚Äôs mention of a Christian cemetery surrounding the tomb suggests that for Bethlehemites ‚Äì exclusively Christian up until the late eighteenth century ‚Äì the biblical site on the outskirts of the city was blessed by the presence of a nurturing saint likely to help those buried in her vicinity to achieve salvation. By the fifteenth century, according to the pilgrim Johannes Poloner, Muslims, most likely from surrounding Muslim villages, were being buried on the southern side of the shrine. Increasingly the cemetery surrounding the tomb became Muslim. In 1839, Mary Damer described bedouin burying a shaykh in the graveyard, while in 1853 James Finn wrote of witnessing Bethlehem Muslims ‚Äúburying one of their dead near the spot.\\" Philip Baldensperger, a resident of nearby Artas between 1856 and 1892, wrote of Rachel‚Äôs Tomb in his Immovable East that \\"a number of Bedawin, men and women, were assembled there for a funeral service, for the Bedawin of the desert of Judah all bury their dead near Rachel‚Äôs sanctuary as their forefathers the Israelites of old did around their sanctuaries.\\" Christian burial in the Tomb‚Äôs vicinity had dropped off by the mid-nineteenth century‚Äù When Sir Moses Montefiore renovated the site in 1841 and obtained the keys for the Jewish community,, page 47: \\"The Jews claim possession of the Tomb as they hold the keys and by virtue of the fact that the building which had fallen into complete decay was entirely rebuilt in 1845 by Sir M. Montefiore. It is also asserted that in 1615 Muhammad, Pasha of Jerusalem, rebuilt the Tomb on their behalf, and by firman granted them the exclusive use of it. The Moslems, on the other hand, claim the ownership of the building as being a place of prayer for Moslems of the neighbourhood, and an integral part of the Moslem cemetery within whose precincts it lies. They state that the Turkish Government recognised it as such, and sent an embroidered covering with Arabic inscriptions for the sarcophagus; again, that it is included among the Tombs of the Prophets for which identity signboards were provided by the Ministry of Waqfs in 1328. A.H. In consequence, objection is made to any repair of the building by the Jews, though free access is allowed to it at all times. From local evidence it appears that the keys were obtained by the Jews from the last Moslem guardian, by name Osman Ibrahim al Atayat, some 80 years ago. This would be at the time of the restoration by Sir Moses Montefiore. It is also stated that the antechamber was specially built, at the time of the restoration, as a place of prayer for the Moslems.\\" he also added an antechamber, including a mihrab for Muslim prayer, to ease Muslim fears. \\"In 1841 Montefiore obtained for the Jews the key of the Tomb, and to conciliate Moslem susceptibility, added a square vestibule with a mihrab as a place of prayer for Moslems.\\" According to the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the tomb was to be part of the internationally administered zone of Jerusalem, but the area was occupied by The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which prohibited Jews from entering the area. Following the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, though not initially falling within Area C, the site has come under the control of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs.Michael Dumper, The Politics of Sacred Space: The Old City of Jerusalem in the Middle East Conflict, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2002p.147. Rachel's tomb is the third holiest site in JudaismIsrael yearbook on human rights, Volume 36, Faculty of Law, Tel Aviv University, 2006. pg. 324 and has become one of the cornerstones of Jewish-Israeli identity.Meron Benvenisti, Son of the Cypresses: Memories, Reflections, and Regrets from a Political Life,University of California Press, 2007 p.45. According to , a mazzebah was erected at the site of Rachel's grave in ancient Israel, leading scholars to consider the site to have been a place of worship in ancient Israel.Susan Starr Sered, Rachel's tomb: Societal liminality and the revitalization of a shrine, Religion, January 1989, Vol.19(1):27‚Äì40, doi:10.1016/0048-721X(89)90075-4, page 30, \\"Although the references in Jeremiah and in Genesis 35:22 perhaps hint at the existence of an early cult of some sort at her Tomb, the first concrete evidence of pilgrimage to Rachel's Tomb appears in reports of Christian pilgrims from the first centuries of the Christian Era and Jewish pilgrims from approximately the 10th century. However, in almost all of the pilgrims' records the references to Rachel'sTomb are incidental ‚Äì it is one more shrine on the road from Bethlehem to Jerusalem. Rachel's Tomb continued to appear as a minor shrine in the itineraries of Jewish and Christian pilgrims through the early 20th century.\\" According to Martin Gilbert, Jews have made pilgrimage to the tomb since ancient times. According to Frederick Strickert, the first historically recorded pilgrimages to the site were by early Christians, and Christian witnesses wrote of the devotion shown to the shrine \\"by local Muslims and then later also by Jews\\"; throughout history, the site was rarely considered a shrine exclusive to one religion and is described as being \\"held in esteem equally by Jews, Muslims, and Christians\\". Following a 1929 British memorandum, in 1949 the UN ruled that the Status Quo, an arrangement approved by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places, applies to the site. In 2005, following Israeli approval on 11 September 2002, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built around the tomb, effectively annexing it to Jerusalem.Wendy Pullan,Bible and Gun: Militarism in Jerusalem's Holy Places, 2013, page 16: \\"In legal terms its location is heavily contested; it was to have been returned to Palestine under the Oslo agreements but in 1995, under pressure from settlers and religious groups, Israel decided to retain it. Since then this important Jewish holy place has been made into a high-profile national religious shrine, referred to by its devotees as either the second or third holiest place in Judaism. The uncertainty about its status stems from different competing interest groups, but the ranking also indicates a recently revived and politically motivated place in the Jewish pantheon. The site‚Äôs religious status and political value have resulted in extraordinary defensive measures being adopted. Today, the Tomb is completely enveloped by the concrete separation barrier making it available to Israeli Jews and tourists coming from Jerusalem in approved vehicles, but inaccessible to Palestinians. It has become a military zone, literally an urban fortress.\\" A 2005 report from OHCHR Special Rapporteur John Dugard noted that: \\"Although Rachel‚Äôs Tomb is a site holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, it has effectively been closed to Muslims and Christians.\\" On October 21, 2015, UNESCO adopted a resolution reaffirming a 2010 statementUNESCO (19 March 2010), 184 EX/37 that Rachel's Tomb was: \\"an integral part of Palestine.\\" On 22 October 2015, the tomb was separated from Bethlehem with a series of concrete barriers.Times of Israel, 22 October 2015: \\"Israeli soldiers on Thursday placed a concrete barrier near a Jewish holy site in the West Bank, ahead of a religious pilgrimage there this weekend.\\" and Times of Israel, August 2016: \\"In October, the IDF installed a series of concrete barriers around the tomb, effectively separating it from the rest of Bethlehem.\\" Biblical accounts and disputed location Northern vs. southern version Biblical scholarship identifies two different traditions in the Hebrew Bible concerning the site of Rachel's burial, respectively a northern version, locating it north of Jerusalem near Ramah, modern Al-Ram, and a southern narrative locating it close to Bethlehem. In rabbinical tradition the duality is resolved by using two different terms in Hebrew to designate these different localities. In the Hebrew version given in Genesis, Rachel and Jacob journey from Shechem to Hebron, a short distance from Ephrath, which is glossed as Bethlehem (35:16‚Äì21, 48:7). She dies on the way giving birth to Benjamin: > \\"And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. > And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave > unto this day.\\" ‚Äî Genesis 35:19‚Äì20 Tom Selwyn notes that R. A. S. Macalister, the most authoritative voice on the topography of Rachel's tomb, advanced the view in 1912 that the identification with Bethlehem was based on a copyist's mistake.Tom Selwyn, 'Tears on the Border: The Case of Rachel's Tomb, Bethlehem, Palestine,' in Maria Kousis, Tom Selwyn, David Clark, (eds.)Contested Mediterranean Spaces: Ethnographic Essays in Honour of Charles Tilly, Berghahn Books 2011 pp. 276‚Äì295, p.279:'Macalister claims that in the earliest versions of Genesis it is written .. that Rachel was buried in Ephrathah, not Ephrath, and that this name refers to the village of Ramah, now er-Ram, near Himzeh to the north of Jerusalem.' The Judean scribal gloss \\"(Ephrath, ) which is Bethlehem\\" was added to distinguish it from a similar toponym Ephrathah in the Bethlehem region. Some consider as certain, however, that Rachel's tomb lay to the north, in Benjamite, not in Judean territory, and that the Bethlehem gloss represents a Judean appropriation of the grave, originally in the north, to enhance Judah's prestige.Zecharia Kallai, 'Rachel's Tomb: A Historiographical Review,' in Vielseitigkeit des Altes Testaments, Peter Lang, Frankfurt 1999 pp.215‚Äì223.Jules Francis Gomes, The Sanctuary of Bethel and the Configuration of Israelite Identity, Walter de Gruyter, 2006 p.92J.Blenkinsopp, 'Benjamin Traditions read in the Early Persian Period,' in Oded Lipschitz, Manfred Oeming (eds.), Judah and the Judeans in the Persian period, Eisenbrauns, 2006 pp.629‚Äì646 p.630-31. At 1 Samuel 10:2, Rachel's tomb is located in the 'territory of Benjamin at Zelzah.' In the period of the monarchy down to the exile, it would follow, Rachel's tomb was thought to lie in Ramah. The indications for this are based on 1 Sam 10:2 and Jer. 31:15, which give an alternative location north of Jerusalem, in the vicinity of ar-Ram, biblical Ramah,Blenkinsopp, p.630-1. five miles south of Bethel.Jules Francis Gomes,The Sanctuary of Bethel and the Configuration of Israelite Identity, p.135:'Rachel's tomb was originally on the border between Benjamin and Joseph. It was later located in Bethlehem as in the gloss on Gen.35:19. One conjecture is that before David's conquest of Jerusalem, the ridge road from Bethel might have been called \\"the Ephrath road\\" (derek ‚ÄôeprƒÅtƒÅh. ; derek‚ÄôeprƒÅt, ), hence the passage in Genesis meant 'the road to Ephrath or Bethlehem,' on which Ramah, if that word refers to a toponym,ramah means 'a height'. Most scholars take it to refer to a place-name. Martien Halvorson-Taylor, Enduring Exile: The Metaphorization of Exile in the Hebrew Bible, BRILL 2010 p.75, n.62, thinks the evidence for this is weak, but argues the later witness of Genesis for Bethlehem as Rachel's burial site 'an even more dubious witness to its location'. lay.David Toshio Tsumura,The First Book of Samuel, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 p.284. A possible location in Ramah could be the five stone monuments north of Hizma. Known as Qubur Bene Isra'in, the largest so-called tomb of the group, the function of which is obscure, has the name Qabr Umm beni Isra'in, that is, \\"tomb of the mother of the descendants of Israel\\". Bethlehem structure As to the structure outside Bethlehem being placed exactly over an ancient tomb, it was revealed during excavations in around 1825 that it was not built over a cavern; however, a deep cavern was discovered a small distance from the site.Schwarz, Joseph. Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Sketch of Palestine, 1850. \\"It was always believed that this stood over the grave of the beloved wife of Jacob. But about twenty-five years ago, when the structure needed some repairs, they were compelled to dig down at the foot of this monument; and it was then found that it was not erected over the cavity in which the grave of Rachel actually is; but at a little distance from the monument there was discovered an uncommonly deep cavern, the opening and direction of which was not precisely under the superstructure in question.\\" History 1939 painting of Rachel's Tomb by Ludwig Blum Byzantine period Traditions regarding the tomb at this location date back to the beginning of the 4th century AD.Pringle, 1998, p. 176 Eusebius' Onomasticon (written before 324) and the Bordeaux Pilgrim (333‚Äì334) mention the tomb as being located 4 miles from Jerusalem. Early Muslim period In the late 7th century, the tomb was marked with a stone pyramid, devoid of any ornamentation.Edward Robinson, Eli Smith. Biblical researches in Palestine and the adjacent regions: a journal of travels in the years 1838 & 1852, Volume 1, J. Murray, 1856. p. 218. During the 10th century, Muqaddasi and other geographers fail to mention the tomb, which indicates that it may have lost importance until the Crusaders revived its veneration. Crusader period Muhammad al-Idrisi (1154) writes, \\"Half-way down the road [between Bethlehem and Jerusalem] is the tomb of Rachel (Rahil), the mother of Joseph and of Benjamin, the two sons of Jacob peace upon them all! The tomb is covered by twelve stones, and above it is a dome vaulted.\\" Benjamin of Tudela (1169‚Äì71) was the first Jewish pilgrim to describe his visit to the tomb. He mentioned a pillar made of 11 stones and a cupola resting on four columns \\"and all the Jews that pass by carve their names upon the stones of the pillar.\\" Petachiah of Regensburg explains that the 11 stones represented the tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, since Rachel had died during his birth. All were marble, with that of Jacob on top.\\" Mamluk period In the 14th century, Antony of Cremona referred to the cenotaph as \\"the most wonderful tomb that I shall ever see. I do not think that with 20 pairs of oxen it would be possible to extract or move one of its stones.\\" It was described by Franciscan pilgrim Nicolas of Poggibonsi (1346‚Äì50) as being 7 feet high and enclosed by a rounded tomb with three gates. From around the 15th century onwards, if not earlier, the tomb was occupied and maintained by the Muslim rulers. The Russian deacon Zozimos describes it as being a mosque in 1421. A guide published in 1467 credits Shahin al-Dhahiri with the building of a cupola, cistern and drinking fountain at the site. The Muslim rebuilding of the \\"dome on four columns\\" was also mentioned by Francesco Suriano in 1485. Felix Fabri (1480‚Äì83) described it as being \\"a lofty pyramid, built of square and polished white stone\\";Fabri, 1896, p.547 He also noted a drinking water trough at its side and reported that \\"this place is venerated alike by Muslims, Jews, and Christians\\". Bernhard von Breidenbach of Mainz (1483) described women praying at the tomb and collecting stones to take home, believing that they would ease their labour.Reflections of God's Holy Land: A Personal Journey Through Israel, Thomas Nelson Inc, 2008. p. 57. Pietro Casola (1494) described it as being \\"beautiful and much honoured by the Moors.\\" Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi (1495), the Jerusalemite qadi and Arab historian, writes under the heading of Qoubbeh R√¢h√Æl (\\"Dome of Rachel\\") that Rachel's tomb lies under this dome on the road between Bethlehem and Bayt Jala and that the edifice is turned towards the Sakhrah (the rock inside the Dome of the Rock) and widely visited by pilgrims.Mujir al-Dyn, 1876, p. 202 Ottoman period =Seventeenth century= In 1615 Muhammad Pasha of Jerusalem repaired the structure and transferred exclusive ownership of the site to the Jews.Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz. Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 511. In 1626, Franciscus Quaresmius visited the site and found that the tomb had been rebuilt by the locals several times. He also found near it a cistern and many Muslim graves. George Sandys wrote in 1632 that ‚ÄúThe sepulchre of Rachel... is mounted on a square... within which another sepulchre is used for a place of prayer by the Mohometans\\". Rabbi Moses Surait of Prague (1650) described a high dome on the top of the tomb, an opening on one side, and a big courtyard surrounded by bricks. He also described a local Jewish cult associated with the site.Susan Sereƒè, Our Mother Rachel, in Arvind Sharma, Katherine K. Young (eds.). The Annual Review of Women in World Religions, Volume 4, SUNY Press, 1991, p. 21‚Äì24. A 1659 Venetian publication of Uri ben Simeon's Yichus ha-Abot included a small and apparently inaccurate illustration.See Survey of Western Palestine, III, p.130; Illustration at this page in the French edition which copied from the Venetian edition (see: )Schulim Ochser, Uri (Ori) Ben Simeon, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906 =Eighteenth century= In March 1756, the Istanbul Jewish Committee for the Jews of Palestine instructed that 500 kurus used by the Jews of Jerusalem to fix a wall at the tomb were to be repaid and used instead for more deserving causes. In 1788, walls were built to enclose the arches. According to Richard Pococke, this was done to \\"hinder the Jews from going into it\\". Pococke also reports that the site was highly regarded by Turks as a place of burial.Pococke, 1745, vol 2, p. 39 =Nineteenth century= The tomb in c.1840, immediately before Montefiore's renovations In 1806 Fran√ßois-Ren√© Chateaubriand described it as \\"a square edifice, surmounted with a small dome: it enjoys the privileges of a mosque, for the Turks as well as the Arabs, honour the families of the patriarchs. [..] it is evidently a Turkish edifice, erected in memory of a santon.Chateaubriand, 1814, vol 1, pp. 390-391 An 1824 report described \\"a stone building, evidently of Turkish construction, which terminates at the top in a dome. Within this edifice is the tomb. It is a pile of stones covered with white plaster, about 10 feet long and nearly as high. The inner wall of the building and the sides of the tomb are covered with Hebrew names, inscribed by Jews.\\"The religious miscellany: Volume 3 Fleming and Geddes, 1824, p. 150 When the structure was undergoing repairs in around 1825, excavations at the foot of the monument revealed that it was not built directly over an underground cavity. However, a small distance from the site, an unusually deep cavern was discovered. In 1830, the Ottomans legally recognized the tomb as a Jewish holy site. Proto-Zionist banker Sir Moses Montefiore visited Rachel's Tomb together with his wife on their first visit to the Holy Land in 1828. The couple were childless, and Lady Montefiore was deeply moved by the tomb, which was in good condition at that time. Before the couple's next visit, in 1839, the Galilee earthquake of 1837 had heavily damaged the tomb. In 1838 the tomb was described as \\"merely an ordinary Muslim Wely, or tomb of a holy person; a small square building of stone with a dome, and within it a tomb in the ordinary Muhammedan form; the whole plastered over with mortar. It is neglected and falling to decay; though pilgrimages are still made to it by the Jews. The naked walls are covered with names in several languages; many of them Hebrew.\\" thumbPlaque inside the tomb acknowledging the Montefiore renovations: THIS IS THE HOUSE WHICH WAS BUILT BY THE GREAT PRINCE OF ISRAEL SIR MOSES MONTEFIORE MAY HIS LIGHT SHINE FORTH AND HIS WIFE, THE DAUGHTER OF KINGS LADY JUDITH MAY WE MERIT TO SEE THE RIGHTEOUS MESSIAH GOD WILLING, AMEN In 1841, Montefiore renovated the site and obtained for the Jews the key of the tomb. He renovated the entire structure, reconstructing and re-plastering its white dome, and added an antechamber, including a mihrab for Muslim prayer, to ease Muslim fears. Professor Glenn Bowman notes that some writers have described this as a ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù of the tomb by Montefiore, asserting that this was not the case.Bowman, 2014, p.39: ‚ÄúThe idea that Moses Montefiore bought the site of Rachel‚Äôs Tomb in 1841 is widely disseminated but ill conceived. The notion is variously promoted by religious national- ists associated with the current occupation of the site, but has spread more widely and appears in texts as diverse as Denys Pringle‚Äôs The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (‚Äúthe tomb was acquired‚Äù);59 Davidson and Gitlitz‚Äôs Pilgrimage from the Ganges to Graceland: An Encyclopedia (Montefiore ‚Äúbought the site‚Äù);60 and Wikipedia (Montefiore ‚Äúpurchased the site‚Äù).61 Nadav Shragai, a journalist on the religious right, has written an influential book in Hebrew on Rachel‚Äôs Tomb,62 which he has drawn upon in numerous articles, nearly all radical defenses of Jewish rights to the tomb in the face of Palestinian threats. In his work he has claimed that Montefiore‚Äôs permission to carry out repairs on the site in 1841 confirmed that ‚Äúthe Turkish [sic] authorities ... recognized the place as the holy property of the Jews.‚Äù63 Meron Benvenisti, a left-leaning politi- cian and writer whose Sacred Landscape (2000) is a landmark study of the erasure and expropriation of Palestinian heritage, also sees Rachel‚Äôs Tomb as Jewish property, going even further than Shragai in his autobiographical Son of the Cypresses, where he claims that Rachel‚Äôs Tomb ‚Äúis one of the few sites in Eretz Israel that have always remained exclusively in Jewish hands.‚Äù64‚Äù In 1843, Ridley Haim Herschell described the building as an ordinary Muslim tomb. He reported that Jews, including Montefiore, were obliged to remain outside the tomb, and prayed at a hole in the wall, so that their voices enter into the tomb. In 1844, William Henry Bartlett referred to the tomb as a \\"Turkish Mosque\\", following a visit to the area in 1842.William Henry Bartlett, Walks about the city and environs of Jerusalem, page 204 In 1845, Montefiore made further architectural improvements at the tomb. He extended the building by constructing an adjacent vaulted ante-chamber on the east for Muslim prayer use and burial preparation, possibly as an act of conciliation.Whittingham, George Napier. The home of fadeless splendour: or, Palestine of today, Dutton, 1921. pg. 314. \\"In 1841 Montefiore obtained for the Jews the key of the Tomb, and to conciliate Moslem susceptibility, added a square vestibule with a mihrab as a place of prayer for Moslems.\\" The room included a mihrab facing Mecca. In the mid-1850s, the marauding Arab e-Ta'amreh tribe forced the Jews to furnish them with an annual ¬£30 payment to prevent them from damaging the tomb. According to Elizabeth Anne Finn, wife of the British consul, James Finn, the only time the Sephardic Jewish community left the Old City of Jerusalem was for monthly prayers at \\"Rachel's Sepulchre\\" or Hebron.Jerusalem in the 19th Century: The Old City, Yehoshua Ben-Arieh, Yad Yitzhak Ben Zvi & St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp.286‚Äì287. In 1864, the Jews of Bombay donated money to dig a well. Although Rachel's Tomb was only an hour and a half walk from the Old City of Jerusalem, many pilgrims found themselves very thirsty and unable to obtain fresh water. Every Rosh Chodesh (beginning of the Jewish month), the Maiden of Ludmir would lead her followers to Rachel‚Äôs tomb and lead a prayer service with various rituals, which included spreading out requests of the past four weeks over the tomb. On the traditional anniversary of Rachel's death, she would lead a solemn procession to the tomb where she chanted psalms in a night-long vigil. In 1868 a publication by the Catholic missionary society the Paulist Fathers noted that \\"[Rachel's] memory has always been held in respect by the Jews and Christians, and even now the former go there every Thursday, to pray and read the old, old history of this mother of their race. When leaving Bethlehem for the fourth and last time, after we had passed the tomb of Rachel, on our way to Jerusalem, Father Luigi and I met a hundred or more Jews on their weekly visit to the venerated spot.\\" The Hebrew monthly ha-Levanon of August 19, 1869, rumored that a group of Christians had purchased land around the tomb and were in the process of demolishing Montefiore's vestibule in order to erect a church there. During the following years, land in the vicinity of the tomb was acquired by Nathan Straus. In October 1875, Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer purchased three dunams of land near the tomb intending to establish a Jewish farming colony there. Custody of the land was transferred to the Perushim community in Jerusalem. In the 1883 volume of the PEF Survey of Palestine, Conder and Kitchener noted: \\"A modern Moslem building stands over the site, and there are Jewish graves near it... The court... is used as a praying-place by Moslems... The inner chambers... are visited by Jewish men and women on Fridays.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 129 =Twentieth century= In 1912 the Ottoman Government permitted the Jews to repair the shrine itself, but not the antechamber. In 1915 the structure had four walls, each about 7 m (23 ft.) long and 6 m (20 ft.) high. The dome, rising about 3 m (10 ft.), \\"is used by the Moslems for prayer; its holy character has hindered them from removing the Hebrew letters from its walls.\\"Bromiley, Geoffrey W. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995 (reprint), [1915]. p. 32. British Mandate period Rachel‚Äôs Tomb 1926 Etz Chaim Talmud Torah students visiting the tomb, 1930s Rachel's tomb appeared on the 500m. banknote and on 2m., 3m. and 10m. stamps of Mandate Palestine between 1927 and 1945, due to it being perceived by the British authorities as ‚Äúthe model of a shared site‚Äù among Muslims, Christians and Jews.Bowman, 2014, p.35: ‚ÄúStrickert, followed by Aghazarian, Merli, Russo, and Tiemann, sees this as the government‚Äôs promulgation of the shrine as a ‚Äúmodel of a shared site.‚Äù‚Äù Three months after the British occupation of Palestine the whole place was cleaned and whitewashed by the Jews without protest from the Muslims. However, in 1921 when the Chief Rabbinate applied to the Municipality of Bethlehem for permission to perform repairs at the site, local Muslims objected.United Nations Conciliation Commission For Palestine: Committee on Jerusalem. (April 8, 1949) In view of this, the High Commissioner ruled that, pending appointment of the Holy Places Commission provided for under the Mandate, all repairs should be undertaken by the Government. However, so much indignation was caused in Jewish circles by this decision that the matter was dropped, the repairs not being considered urgent. In 1925 the Sephardic Jewish community requested permission to repair the tomb. The building was then made structurally sound and exterior repairs were effected by the Government, but permission was refused by the Jews (who had the keys) for the Government to repair the interior of the shrine. As the interior repairs were unimportant, the Government dropped the matter, in order to avoid controversy. In 1926 Max Bodenheimer blamed the Jews for letting one of their holy sites appear so neglected and uncared for. During this period, both Jews and Muslims visited the site. From the 1940s, it came to be viewed as a symbol of the Jewish people's return to Zion, to its ancient homeland,Susan Sered, \\"A Tale of Three Rachels: The Natural Herstory of a Cultural Symbol,\\" in Nashim: a journal of Jewish women's studies & gender issues, Issues 1‚Äì2, Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies, 1998. \\"In the 1940s, by contrast, Rachel's Tomb became explicitly identified with the return to Zion, Jewish statehood and Allied victory.\\" For Jewish women, the tomb was associated with fertility and became a place of pilgrimage to pray for successful childbirth.Jill Dubisch, Michael Winkelman, Pilgrimage and Healing, University of Arizona Press, 2005 p.75. Depictions of the Tomb of Rachel have appeared in Jewish religious books and works of art. Muslims prayed inside the mosque there and the cemetery at the tomb was the main Muslim cemetery in the Bethlehem area. The building was also used for Islamic funeral rituals. It is reported that Jews and Muslims respected each other and accommodated each other's rituals. During the riots of 1929, violence hampered regular visits by Jews to the tomb. Both Jews and Muslims demanded control of the site, with the Muslims claiming it was an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it is situated. It also demanded a renewal of the old Muslim custom of purifying corpses in the tomb's antechamber. Jordanian period Following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War till 1967, the site was occupied then annexed by Jordan. the site was overseen by the Islamic waqf. On December 11, 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194 which called for free access to all the holy places in Israel and the remainder of the territory of the former Palestine Mandate of Great Britain. In April 1949, the Jerusalem Committee prepared a document for the UN Secretariat in order to establish the status of the different holy places in the area of the former British Mandate for Palestine. It noted that ownership of Rachel's Tomb was claimed by both Jews and Muslims. The Jews claimed possession by virtue of a 1615 firman granted by the Pasha of Jerusalem which gave them exclusive use of the site and that the building, which had fallen into decay, was entirely restored by Moses Montefiore in 1845; the keys were obtained by the Jews from the last Muslim guardian at this time. The Muslims claimed the site was a place of Muslim prayer and an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it was situated. They stated that the Ottoman Government had recognised it as such and that it is included among the Tombs of the Prophets for which identity signboards were issued by the Ministry of Waqfs in 1898. They also asserted that the antechamber built by Montefiore was specially built as a place of prayer for Muslims. The UN ruled that the status quo, an arrangement approved by the Ottoman Decree of 1757 concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places, apply to the site. In theory, free access was to be granted as stipulated in the 1949 Armistice Agreements, though Israelis, unable to enter Jordan, were prevented from visiting.Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani. Israel and the Palestinian territories, Rough Guides, 1998. p. 395. Non-Israeli Jews, however, continued to visit the site. During this period the Muslim cemetery was expanded. Israeli control MK Yosef Tamir visiting the tomb, immediately after the Six-Day War in 1967 Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied of the West Bank, which included the tomb. The tomb was placed under Israeli military administration. Prime minister Levi Eshkol instructed that the tomb be included within the new expanded municipal borders of Jerusalem, but citing security concerns, Moshe Dayan decided not to include it within the territory that was annexed to Jerusalem.Benveni≈õt√Æ, M√™r√¥n. Son of the Cypresses: Memories, Reflections, and Regrets from a Political Life, University of California Press, 2007, p.44‚Äì45. Islamic crescents, inscribed into the rooms of the structure, were subsequently erased. Muslims were prevented from using the mosque, although they were allowed to use the cemetery for a while. Starting in 1993, Muslims were barred from using the cemetery. According to Bethlehem University, \\"[a]ccess to Rachel's Tomb is now restricted to tourists entering from Israel.\\"\\"Bethlehem University Research Project Explores Importance of Rachel's Tomb.\\" Bethlehem University. 4 May 2009. 25 March 2012. =Fortification= UN map showing the current location of the tomb, surrounded on all sides by the Israeli West Bank barrier (shown in red). The tomb is situated east and north, respectively, of the Ayda and 'Azza Palestinian refugee camps, and south of the Gilo checkpoint and the Israeli settlements of Gilo and Har Homa. The tomb is in the Seam Zone: the green-blue line at the top of the map represents the border of the West Bank and Israel, and the blue dashed line just north of the tomb represents the unilaterally- declared municipal boundary of Jerusalem The Oslo II Accord of September 28, 1995 placed Rachel's Tomb in Area C under Israeli jurisdiction. Originally, Yitzhak Rabin had decided to cede Rachel's Tomb, along with Bethlehem. Israel's first draft had placed Rachel's Tomb, which is situated 460 metres from the municipal border of Jerusalem, in Area A under PA jurisdiction. Popular pressure exerted by religious parties in Israel to keep the religious site under Israeli control threatened the agreement, and Yassir Arafat agreed to forego the request.Nahum Barnea, 'The battle for Jerusalem,' Ynet, 10 November 2014.Thousands at burial of Rabbi Menahem Porush, Jerusalem Post, (February 23, 2010) On December 1, 1995, Bethlehem, with the exception of the tomb enclave, passed under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. Comparison of the southern view of the Tomb in the early 20th and 21st centuries, showing the fortifications In 1996, Israel began an 18-month fortification of the site at a cost of $2m. It included a wall and adjacent military post. In response, Palestinians said that \\"the Tomb of Rachel was on Islamic land\\" and that the structure was in fact a mosque built at the time of the Arab conquest in honour of Bilal ibn Rabah, an Ethiopian known in Islamic history as the first muezzin. After an attack on Joseph's Tomb and its subsequent takeover and desecration by Arabs, hundreds of residents of Bethlehem and the Aida refugee camp, led by the Palestinian Authority- appointed governor of Bethlehem, Muhammad Rashad al-Jabari, attacked Rachel's Tomb. They set the scaffolding that had been erected around it on fire and tried to break in. The IDF dispersed the mob with gunfire and stun grenades, and dozens were wounded. In the following years, the Israeli-controlled site became a flashpoint between young Palestinians who hurled stones, bottles and firebombs and IDF troops, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.Unrest during the late 1990s: *Capital braces for violence, Jerusalem Post, (March 21, 1997). *Israelis, Arabs clash in protest near Rachel's tomb, The Deseret News, (May 30, 1997). *Palestinians stone soldiers by Rachel's Tomb, Jerusalem Post, (August 24, 1997). *More West Bank Tension As Envoy Meets Arafat, New York Times, (September 13, 1998). Fortified entrance road to the tomb, surrounded by the Israeli West Bank barrier At the end of 2000, when the second intifada broke out, the tomb came under attack for 41 days. In May 2001, fifty Jews found themselves trapped inside by a firefight between the IDF and Palestinian Authority gunmen. In March 2002 the IDF returned to Bethlehem as part of Operation Defensive Shield and remained there for an extended period of time. In September 2002, the tomb was incorporated on the Israeli side of the West Bank barrier and surrounded by a concrete wall and watchtowers. In February 2005, the Israel Supreme Court rejected a Palestinian appeal to change the route of the security fence in the region of the tomb. Israeli construction destroyed the Palestinian neighbourhood of Qubbet Rahil. Israel also declared the area to be a part of Jerusalem. From 2011, a \\"Wall Museum\\" was created by Palestinians on the North wall of the Israeli separation barrier surrounding Rachel‚Äôs tomb.Journal of Ethnology and Folkloristics 11 (1): 83‚Äì110 DOI: 10.1515/jef-2017-0006: \\"The Arab Educational Institute (AEI), which is a member of the international peace movement Pax Christi, opened the Sumud Story House in 2009.

These stories have been written and printed on panels posted on the Wall in the Rachel's Tomb Area constituting the Wall Museum.\\" In February 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that the tomb would become a part of the national Jewish heritage sites rehabilitation plan. The decision was opposed by the Palestinian Authority, who saw it as a political decision associated with Israel's settlement project. The UN's special coordinator for the Middle East, Robert Serry, issued a statement of concern over the move, saying that the site is in Palestinian territory and has significance in both Judaism and Islam. The Jordanian government said that the move would derail peace efforts in the Middle East and condemned \\"unilateral Israeli measures which affect holy places and offend sentiments of Muslims throughout the world\\". UNESCO urged Israel to remove the site from its heritage list, stating that it was \\"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territories\\". A resolution was passed at UNESCO that acknowledged both the Jewish and Islamic significance of the site, describing the site as both Bilal ibn Rabah Mosque and as Rachel's Tomb. The resolution passed with 44 countries supporting it, twelve countries abstaining, and only the United States voting to oppose. An article written by Nadav Shargai of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, published in the Jerusalem Post criticized UNESCO, arguing that the site was not a mosque and that the move was politically motivated to disenfranchise Israel and Jewish religious traditions. Also writing in the Jerusalem Post, Larry Derfner, defended the UNESCO position. He pointed out that UNESCO had explicitly recognized the Jewish connection to the site, having only denounced Israeli claims of sovereignty, while also acknowledging the Islamic and Christian significance of the site. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office criticised the resolution, claiming that: \\"the attempt to detach the Nation of Israel from its heritage is absurd. ... If the nearly 4,000-year-old burial sites of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish Nation ‚Äì Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah ‚Äì are not part of its culture and tradition, then what is a national cultural site?\\"PM insists Rachel's Tomb is heritage site, Ynet, 10/29/2010 Haredi Jews praying at the tomb Jewish religious significance Rabbinic traditions In Jewish lore, Rachel passed away on 11 Cheshvan 1553 BCE.Jewish Calendar, Passing of Rachel, Chabad.org. *According to the Midrash, the first person to pray at Rachel's tomb was her eldest son, Joseph. While he was being carried away to Egypt after his brothers had sold him into slavery, he broke away from his captors and ran to his mother's grave. He threw himself upon the ground, wept aloud and cried \\"Mother! mother! Wake up. Arise and see my suffering.\\" He heard his mother respond: \\"Do not fear. Go with them, and God will be with you.\\" *A number of reasons are given why Rachel was buried by the road side and not in the Cave of Machpela with the other Patriarchs and Matriarchs: **Jacob foresaw that following the destruction of the First Temple the Jews would be exiled to Babylon. They would cry out as they passed her grave, and be comforted by her. She would intercede on their behalf, asking for mercy from God who would hear her prayer. **Although Rachel was buried within the boundaries of the Holy Land, she was not buried in the Cave of Machpelah due to her sudden and unexpected death. Jacob, looking after his children and herds of cattle, simply did not have the opportunity to embalm her body to allow for the slow journey to Hebron.Ramban. Genesis, Volume 2. Mesorah Publications Ltd, 2005. pp. 545‚Äì47. **Jacob was intent on not burying Rachel at Hebron, as he wished to prevent himself feeling ashamed before his forefathers, lest it appear he still regarded both sisters as his wives ‚Äì a biblically forbidden union. *According to the mystical work, Zohar, when the Messiah appears, he will lead the dispersed Jews back to the Land of Israel, along the road which passes Rachel's grave. Location Early Jewish scholars noticed an apparent contradiction in the Bible with regards to the location of Rachel's grave. In Genesis, the Bible states that Rachel was buried \\"on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.\\" Yet a reference to her tomb in Samuel states: \\"When you go from me today, you will find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah\\" (1 Sam 10:2). Rashi asks: \\"Now, isn't Rachel's tomb in the border of Judah, in Bethlehem?\\" He explains that the verse rather means: \\"Now they are by Rachel's tomb, and when you will meet them, you will find them in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah.\\" Similarly, Ramban assumes that the site shown today near Bethlehem reflects an authentic tradition. After he had arrived in Jerusalem and seen \\"with his own eyes\\" that Rachel's tomb was on the outskirts of Bethlehem, he retracted his original understanding of her tomb being located north of Jerusalem and concluded that the reference in Jeremiah (Jer 31:15) which seemed to place her burial place in Ramah, is to be understood allegorically. There remains however, a dispute as to whether her tomb near Bethlehem was in the tribal territory of Judah, or of her son Benjamin.Ramban. Genesis, Volume 2. Mesorah Publications Ltd, 2005. p. 247. Customs A Jewish tradition teaches that Rachel weeps for her children and that when the Jews were taken into exile, she wept as they passed by her grave on the way to Babylonia. Jews have made pilgrimage to the tomb since ancient times. There is a tradition regarding the key that unlocked the door to the tomb. The key was about long and made of brass. The beadle kept it with him at all times, and it was not uncommon that someone would knock at his door in the middle of the night requesting it to ease the labor pains of an expectant mother. The key was placed under her pillow and almost immediately, the pains would subside and the delivery would take place peacefully. Till this day there is an ancient tradition regarding a segulah or charm which is the most famous women's ritual at the tomb.Susan Sered, \\"Rachel's Tomb and the Milk Grotto of the Virgin Mary: Two Women's Shrines in Bethlehem\\", Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, vol 2, 1986, pp. 7‚Äì22. A red string is tied around the tomb seven times then worn as a charm for fertility. This use of the string is comparatively recent, though there is a report of its use to ward off diseases in the 1880s.Susan Sered, \\"Rachel's Tomb: The Development of a Cult\\", Jewish Studies Quarterly, vol 2, 1995, pp. 103‚Äì148. The Torah Ark in Rachel's Tomb is covered with a curtain (Hebrew: parokhet) made from the wedding gown of Nava Applebaum, a young Israeli woman who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist in a suicide bombing at Caf√© Hillel in Jerusalem in 2003, on the eve of her wedding.Review of The Story of Rachel's Tomb, Joshua Schwartz, Jewish Quarterly Review 97.3 (2007) e100-e103 Replicas Tombstone in the shape of Rachel's Tomb, Trumpeldor Cemetery, Tel Aviv The tomb of Sir Moses Montefiore, adjacent to the Montefiore synagogue in Ramsgate, England, is a replica of Rachel's Tomb.Sharman Kadish, Jewish Heritage in England : An Architectural Guide, English Heritage, 2006, p. 62 In 1934, the Michigan Memorial Park planned to reproduce the tomb. When built, it was used to house the sound system and pipe organ used during funerals, but it has since been demolished.

After leaving school in the last months of the First World War he was commissioned as a junior officer in the British Army, but by the time he had completed his training the war was over and he was demobilised. He then studied English at Oxford, and after some false starts he spent his early working life as an academic, lecturing in English literature at Birkbeck College, part of the University of London, during which time he published several works on Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Finding his income inadequate to support himself and his family, he left the university and took up a post producing and writing for the BBC. He remained with the BBC until after the Second World War, when he became a freelance writer, and remained so for the rest of his life. His series of humorous books on how to secure an unfair advantage began in 1947 with Gamesmanship, purporting to show how poor players can beat better ones by subtle psychological ploys. This sold prodigiously and led to a series of sequels covering other aspects of life. The books were adapted for the cinema in the 1960s and for television in the 1970s. Biography Early years Potter was born in Battersea, London, the only son of Frank Collard Potter (1858‚Äì1939), a chartered accountant, and his wife Elizabeth Mary Jubilee n√©e Reynolds (1863‚Äì1950).Grenfell, Joyce, \\"Potter, Stephen Meredith (1900‚Äì1969)‚Äô\\", rev. Clare L. Taylor, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2008, accessed 22 May 2010 (requires subscription) He attended Westminster School from age 13 to 18, during the First World War. As he reached school-leaving age he wrote in his diary, \\"If this war doesn't end soon I shall have to join the beastly army and lay down my blooming life for my blinking country.\\"Potter's diary, quoted in Davis, Russell, \\"The master- shipwright\\", Times Literary Supplement, 17 October 1980, p. 1185 He volunteered for the army, was trained as an officer and \\"passed out\\" (graduated) as top of his company. He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards as a second lieutenant just as the war was ending, and did not see active service.Davis, Russell, \\"The master-shipwright\\", review of biography of Potter by Alan Jenkins, Times Literary Supplement, 17 October 1980, p. 1185 Potter was demobilised in 1919, and spent a few months in his father's office learning book-keeping, before going to Merton College, Oxford, to study English. His family paid for his university education, a fact that put him in the shadow of his elder sister Muriel (later a form mistress at St Paul's Girls' School, then headmistress of South Hampstead High School),Imogen Holst: A Life in Music, Christopher Grogan, 2007, The Boydell Press, pg 17The A.M.A.: The Journal of the Incorporated Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools, Volume 31, Incorporated Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools., 1936, pg 316 who had won a scholarship to St Hugh's College, Oxford,Oxford University Gazette, volume 51, 1920, Oxford University Press, pg 134 and had taken a first-class degree. Potter achieved only a second-class degree in English language and literature. On the strength of this he was offered the post of talks producer at the BBC, but turned it down as it was based in the provincial city of Birmingham, where he had no wish to reside. Potter instead tried to earn a living as an elocution teacher in London, advertising \\"Cockney accents cured\\", but attracted only one pupil. He then tried his luck as a tutor and schoolmaster before becoming private secretary to a well-known playwright, Henry Arthur Jones. Lecturer in English literature In 1926 Potter began teaching English literature at Birkbeck College, University of London. On 7 July 1927 he married Marian Anderson Attenborough (1900‚Äì1981), a painter professionally known as Mary Potter. There were two sons of the marriage. The family at first lived in Chiswick, London, before moving to a flat in Harley Street.Bessborough, Madeleine, \\"Potter, Marian Anderson (Mary)(1900‚Äì1981)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2009, accessed 22 May 2010 (requires subscription) Potter's first book, The Young Man (1929), was an autobiographical novel, which was well-reviewed. The Manchester Guardian wrote, \\"a brilliant performance ... a distinguished contribution to intellectual fiction.\\"\\"Books of the Day\\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 October 1929, p. 7 In 1930 he wrote D. H. Lawrence: A First Study, the first book- length work on Lawrence, which appeared in print within a few days of the death of its subject, unfortunate timing because it seemed like an inadequate memorial rather than what it was intended to be, a critical reappraisal. It also suffered from a regrettable misprint, rendering the heading \\"Sea and Sardinia\\", as \\"Sex and Sardinia\\". This was soon amplified by rumour into \\"Sex and Sardines\\", none of which helped Potter's reputation as a serious writer. Potter's most comprehensive critic was the friend from whom he had inherited the Cape commission, G.B. Edwards, in Middleton Murry's Adelphi.Edward Chaney, Genius Friend: G.B. Edwards and The Book of Ebenezer le Page, Blue Ormer 2015 . After this he concentrated in his next four works on Coleridge. He edited the Nonesuch Press Coleridge (1933), praised in The Times as \\"the best anthology that has ever shown Coleridge as poet, philosopher and critic.\\"Books For the Holidays ‚Äì Successes of the Year, A Selected List\\", The Times, 27 July 1934, p. 8 This was followed by an edition of Sara Coleridge's letters to Thomas Poole, Minnow among Tritons (1934), which Potter edited from the original manuscripts in the British Museum.The Times Literary Supplement, 19 July 1934, p. 507 In 1941 he wrote a play, Married to a Genius, based on the Coleridge marriage. In 1935 he published his most important contribution to the subject, Coleridge and S.T.C., a discussion of the duality in the poet's nature, \\"not merely the earlier and the later, but the true and the false, and the exciting and the nauseating,\\" as John Middleton Murry put it in a review in The Times Literary Supplement. Reviews were good, but with reservations that Potter oversimplified the dichotomy in Coleridge's nature (The Observer) or else did not explore the underlying reasons for it (TLS).de S√©lincourt, Basil, \\"Two Beings in One\\", The Observer, 28 April 1935, p. 5 In 1937 Potter published The Muse in Chains: a Study in Education, a humorous satire on the academic teaching of English literature. G. M. Young wrote of it: \\"if I were suddenly commissioned by some Golden Dustman to organize a new University, I think I should send for Mr. Potter and offer him the Chair of English literature forthwith.\\"quoted in ODNB article Other reviewers thought Potter's suggestions more entertaining than practical.de S√©lincourt, Basil, \\"The Teaching of English\\", The Manchester Guardian, 23 February 1937, p. 7 Potter's humorous insights into academic life were widely praised. He wrote of George Saintsbury: \\"It is recorded that for eighteen years he started the day by reading a French novel (in preparation for his history of them) ‚Äì an act so unnatural to man as almost in itself to amount to genius.\\"The Muse in Chains, quoted in Hart-Davis, Volume 3, 30 March 1958 BBC writer and producer Potter first wrote for BBC radio in 1936. Finding that his academic career, although promising, was insufficiently well paid to support his family, he resigned from Birkbeck in 1937 and the following year joined the BBC as a writer-producer in its features department, originally concentrating on literary features and documentaries. In the same year he joined the Savile Club, known for its artistic and especially literary members, who have included Hardy, Kipling, and Yeats. He was a leading player of the club's idiosyncratic version of snooker, and some of his later \\"gamesmanship\\" ploys are thought to have originated in the Savile's games room.\\"Savile Snooker\\", Savile Club website. The rules of Savile Snooker, formulated by Potter, can be accessed here. At the outbreak of the Second World War Potter was sent by the BBC to work in Manchester. Later in the war years he and his wife moved south, living in a farmhouse in Essex where she found more scope to pursue her career as a painter. In 1943 Potter collaborated with Joyce Grenfell on a gently satirical comedy feature \\"How to Talk to Children\\".University of Bristol Theatre Collection It was well received and they made twenty-eight more \\"How to ...\\" programmes, including \\"How to Woo\\" and \\"How to Give a Party\\". In 1946 \\"How to Listen\\" was the first broadcast heard on the newly created Third Programme.Joyce Grenfell, his co-author, wrote in the ODNB article that this feature was called \\"How to Listen to Radio\\", but comparison with the published programme listings (e.g. The Manchester Guardian, 28 September 1946, p. 2 and The Times, 30 September 1946, p. 6) shows that the title was \\"How to Listen\\" tout court. At the end of the war, Potter took on a number of concurrent literary tasks. These included drama critic for the New Statesman and book reviewer for the News Chronicle. Gamesmanship and freelance writing A ten-day power-cut at the beginning of 1947 prevented any broadcasting and gave Potter the opportunity to dash off a book. To the despair of his publisher he was a far from methodical author: every Potter manuscript was \\"a mass of dirty bits of paper, vilely typed, corrected in illegible biro, episodic and half- revised.\\"Hart-Davis, Volume 4, Letter of 7 February 1959 This book, The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship: Or the Art of Winning Games Without Actually Cheating, illustrated by Frank Wilson, was published in 1947, and sold prodigiously.Lowrey, Burling, \\"The Timelessness of Stephen Potter's Gamesmanship\\", Virginia Quarterly Review, Autumn 1993, pp.718‚Äì26 It was the first of his series of books purporting to teach ploys for manipulating one's associates, making them feel inferior and thus gaining the status of being one-up on them. From this book, the term \\"Gamesmanship\\" entered the English language. Potter said that he was introduced to the technique by C. E. M. Joad during a game of tennis in which Joad and Potter were struggling against two fit young students. Joad politely requested the students to state clearly whether a ball had landed in or out (when in truth it was so obviously out that they had not thought it necessary to say so). This nonplussed the students, who wondered if their sportsmanship was in question; they became so edgy that they lost the match.\\"Potter, Stephen\\", Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2003, accessed 22 May 2010 (requires subscription) With the success of Gamesmanship, Potter left the BBC in 1949, ended his existing journalistic commitments, and briefly became editor of a weekly, Leader Magazine.Sleeve notes for the Penguin edition of The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship The magazine closed in 1950, and thereafter he was a freelance writer for the rest of his life. Potter followed up the success of Gamesmanship, extending the basic idea to many other aspects of life, in Some Notes on Lifemanship (1950), which was another big seller. In \\"Lifemanship\\" Potter extended the principles of gamesmanship to courtship (\\"Woomanship\\"), literature (\\"Writermanship\\") and pastimes (\\"Conversationship\\"). Thus for example the reader is enjoined, \\"never forget the uses of Lowbrowmanship in conversation ... LOWBROWMAN: Oh, I don't know, I rather like a good bit of old-fashioned vulgarity. And I'm awfully sorry but I like leg shows. If the Lowbrowman happens to be a Professor of Aesthetics ... his remark is all the more irritating\\".Stephen Potter, Some Notes on Lifemanship (London 1950) p. 26 A related gambit for the journalist was ' Daily Mirrorship ... an unaffected love of tremendously ordinary and homely things like Danny Kaye, mild and bitter, the Daily Mirror, the Bertram Mills circus and Rita Hayworth\\"Potter, Lifemanship p. 77 Potter mentions in passing how \\"in the last of my Bude lectures I spoke of Gamesmanship and Shakespeare, where most of my remarks referred to Footnote Play\\",Potter, Lifemanship p. 123 His notes on Donmanship refer to the \\"art of Criticising without Actually Listening\\"Potter, Lifemanship p. 91 In his notes on Woomanship, Potter expresses surprise that \\"twelve times as many workers volunteered to send in reports on Woomanship as on any other subject\\"Potter, Lifemanship p. 53 I mixed gamesmanship, for a man \\"a good working knowledge of the Chivalry Gambit is essential\\"; a woman's counter to \\"the least signs of trying the 'I have long adored you from afar' move\\", is to \\"treat it immediately as a formal proposal of marriage which you shyly accept. This is one of the most devastating, the most match-winning, counters in the whole realm of gamesmanship\\".Potter, Lifemanship pp. 116‚Äì7 In 1951 Potter and his wife moved to Suffolk, to the Red House in Aldeburgh. The most famous local residents were Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, with whom the Potters quickly became friendly. They got involved with the running of Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, and \\"every summer Britten, Peter Pears, and the Potters formed the nucleus of countless tennis parties on the grass court at the Red House.\\" In 1954, Potter asked his wife for a divorce. She consented, and he moved away from Aldeburgh. Finding the Red House too large and expensive for one person, Mary Potter agreed to exchange houses with Britten and Pears, who moved into the Red House, with which they were associated for the rest of their lives and beyond.See the Britten-Pears Foundation website In 1955, after nearly 30 years of marriage, the Potters' divorce was finalised, and he remarried, to Heather Jenner, the founder of The Marriage Bureau. Their only child, Luke, was born the following year. A second successor to Gamesmanship was published as One- Upmanship (1952). Potter had become well enough known overseas to be invited to give a literary lecture tour of America. He described his experiences in Potter on America (1956), which received a long and complimentary review in The Times Literary Supplement: \\"Mr. Potter's private army of Lifemen will need no recommendation to this latest frolic .... It is a pleasure to discover or rediscover the United States in this company, for the author is the most literate of humorists.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 14 December 1956, p. 752 A third sequel to Gamesmanship, was published in 1958 under the title of Supermanship. Its publisher, Rupert Hart-Davis, privately wrote of the book, \\"Gamesmanship made me laugh a lot, and its two successors were just good enough (all three still sell prodigiously), but the world has moved (deathwards, you may say) in the last ten years, and Potter hasn't budged an inch. In truth the joke is played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care.\\"Hart-Davis, Volume 3, Letter of 13 April 1958 Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, \\"his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a little tired of his own joke.\\" But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising \\"the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long.\\" Later years By the late 1950s the concept and the suffix \\"-manship\\" had entered the English language. The foreign policy of the American secretary of state John Foster Dulles was universally known as \\"brinkmanship\\",The Times obituary notice, 3 December 1969, p. 13 and in England Prince Philip borrowed from Potter in 1957, accusing accountants of \\"taxmanship ‚Äì the art of scoring off the Inland Revenue without actually cheating\\".The Times, 10 May 1955, p. 7The Oxford English Dictionary (2010) also lists \\"conferencemanship\\", \\"deathmanship\\", \\"grantsmanship\\", \\"namesmanship\\", \\"queuemanship\\", and \\"winemanship\\". According to Joyce Grenfell, Potter had become bored with the joke by this time, \\"but for the rest of his life he found it difficult to speak or write naturally, so accustomed had he grown to the jocose gambits and ploys of his own invention.\\" Potter himself was aware of the pigeonhole in which he had put himself. He described himself in The Times in 1967 as \\"one whose sole contribution to world thought has been the naming and description of the form of behaviour now known as gamesmanship\\".Potter, Stephen, Letter to The Times, 10 April 1967, p. 11 Another friend said of him, \\"This kind of fame was not what he had hoped for. He wanted to be a great serious writer. Yet that was totally beyond him.\\"Collis, John Stewart, \\"One-up for ever\\", The Times, 9 October 1980, p. 11 Potter's last works went in new directions. In 1959 he wrote a corporate history of H.J. Heinz under the title The Magic Number, and his autobiography of his first 20 years, Steps to Immaturity. His publisher was doubtful about the latter, but it was well received. The Times Literary Supplement, called it \\"this sympathetic, beguiling book\\" and looked forward to a sequel,The Times Literary Supplement, 18 December 1959, p. 743 and other papers from The Daily Express to The New Statesman praised it in their reviews.The Times, 17 December 1959, p. 12 In 1965 when his youngest son was about 9 years old, Potter wrote a children's book, Squawky, illustrated by George Him, with whom he had earlier created the mythical County of Schweppshire as part of an advertising campaign for a soft-drink manufacturer.George Him website, accessed 22 May 2010 At the time of his death he was making notes on word origins from the natural world; they were posthumously edited and published in 1973 as Pedigree: Essays on the Etymology of Words from Nature.The Times Literary Supplement, 14 December 1973, p. 1545 Potter died of pneumonia in London at the age of 69. Adaptations and commemorations The 1960 film School for Scoundrels recapitulates many of the \\"one-up\\" ideas, and extends them to \\"Woo-manship\\", meaning the art of manipulative seduction of women. The script was adapted by Peter Ustinov from Potter's books. The film starred Ian Carmichael as the innocent in need of Professor Potter's teaching, Alastair Sim as Potter, Terry-Thomas, Dennis Price and Peter Jones as exemplars of one- upmanship.The Times, 25 April 1959, p. 10 One-Upmanship is a British television series based on Potter's work. It was written and adapted by Barry Took for the BBC for a Christmas special, initially in 1974. Starring Richard Briers, Peter Jones (who also played a supporting role in School for Scoundrels), and Frederick Jaeger, it was subsequently broadened into three series that were broadcast between 1976 and 1978. Details of the broadcasts can be found on this BBC comedy Web site. Potter's diaries, acquired by the University of Texas after his death, were a primary source for Stephen Potter at the BBC (2004) by his second son, Julian Potter, a chronicle of Potter's time in the features department of the BBC in the 1940s. Raffles and the Match-Fixing Syndicate, by Adam Corres, is an extension of Potter's theories, explaining the principles of cricket gamesmanship and the psychology of \\"thinking the batsman out\\". In a 1959 article Edmund Wilson wondered why Potter, as an academic himself, did not \\"exploit the fertile field of one- upmanship among professors, whereupon Wilson proceeded to fill the gap\\". In 2007, devotees of Potter created an annual winter golf tournament based on the tactics espoused in the author's book Gamesmanship. \\"The Potter Cup\\" is held annually at Fenwick Golf Course in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. Wider influence Eric Berne in his best-selling Games People Play readily acknowledges Potter's Gamemanship as a precursor: 'Due credit should be given to Stephen Potter for his perceptive, humorous discussions of manoeuvres, or \\"ploys\\", in everyday social situations'.Eric Berne, Games People Play (Penguin) p. 58 Elsewhere he calls Potter 'the chief representative of the humorous exposition of ulterior transactions'.Eric Berne, The Structure and Dynamics of Organizations and Groups (1973) What has been termed Potter's \\"blend of flat and serious tone (reminiscent of a gentlemanly sports handbook) united with a sceptical judgement of the values of the English middle-class social scene\\"Angus Ross, in David Daiches ed., The Penguin Companion to Literature I (Penguin 1971) p. 426 would thus seem to have fed into Berne's own \\"sardonically humorous Games People Play ... con-games of daily life that Dr Berne describes with desperately penetrating gallows-wit\\".G. Legman, Rationale of the Dirty Joke Vol I (Herts 1973) p. 20 Potter's ' Game Leg...\\"Limpmanship\\", as it used to be called, or the exact use of minor injury'Stephen Potter, The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship (London 1947) p. 36 precedes Berne's \\"Wooden Leg\\"; Potter's 'Nice Chapmanship ... Being a Nice Chap in certain circumstances is valuable'Potter, Gamesmanship p. 26 and p. 30 precedes Berne's \\"Good Joe\\"; Potter's \\"Advicemanship\\", whereby 'if properly managed, the mere giving of advice is sufficient'Potter, Gamesmanship p. 123 and p. 45 to win, precedes Berne's \\"I'm Only Trying to Help You\\", where 'the damage is done while being helpful'.Berne, Games p. 127 And 'Just as there are O.K.-words in conversationship',Lifemanship, quoted in J.

Oppression may be overt or covert, depending on how it is practiced.Oppression Dictionary.comhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oppression Oppression refers to discrimination when the injustice does not target and may not directly afflict everyone in society but instead targets specific groups of people. No universally accepted model or terminology has yet emerged to describe oppression in its entirety, although some of the scholars cite evidence of different types of oppression, such as social oppression, institutional oppression, and economic oppression. Authoritarian oppression The word oppress comes from the Latin oppressus, past participle of opprimere, (\\"to press against\\", \\"to squeeze\\", \\"to suffocate\\"). Thus, when authoritarian governments use oppression to subjugate the people, they want their citizenry to feel that \\"pressing down\\", and to live in fear that if they displease the authorities they will, in a metaphorical sense, be \\"squeezed\\" and \\"suffocated\\", e.g., thrown in a dank, dark, state prison or summarily executed. Such governments oppress the people using restriction, control, terror, hopelessness, and despair. The tyrant's tools of oppression include, for example, extremely harsh punishments for \\"unpatriotic\\" statements; developing a loyal, guileful secret police force; prohibiting freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press; controlling the monetary system and economy; and imprisoning or killing activists or other leaders who might pose a threat to their power. Socioeconomic, political, legal, cultural, and institutional oppression Oppression also refers to a more insidious type of manipulation and control, in this instance involving the subjugation and marginalization of specific groups of people within a country or society, such as: girls and women, boys and men, people of color, religious communities, citizens in poverty, LGBT people, youth and children, and many more. This socioeconomic, cultural, political, legal, and institutional oppression (hereinafter, \\"social oppression\\") probably occurs in every country, culture, and society, including the most advanced democracies, such as the United States, Japan, Costa Rica, Sweden, and Canada. A single, widely accepted definition of social oppression does not yet exist, although there are commonalities. Taylor (2016) defined (social) oppression in this way: > Oppression is a form of injustice that occurs when one social group is > subordinated while another is privileged, and oppression is maintained by a > variety of different mechanisms including social norms, stereotypes and > institutional rules. A key feature of oppression is that it is perpetrated > by and affects social groups. ... [Oppression] occurs when a particular > social group is unjustly subordinated, and where that subordination is not > necessarily deliberate but instead results from a complex network of social > restrictions, ranging from laws and institutions to implicit biases and > stereotypes. In such cases, there may be no deliberate attempt to > subordinate the relevant group, but the group is nonetheless unjustly > subordinated by this network of social constraints. Harvey (1999) suggested the term \\"civilized oppression\\", which he introduced as follows: > It is harder still to become aware of what I call 'civilized Oppression,' > that involves neither physical violence nor the use of law. Yet these subtle > forms are by far the most prevalent in Western industrialized societies. > This work will focus on issues that are common to such subtle oppression in > several different contexts (such as racism, classism, and sexism) ... > Analyzing what is involved in civilized oppression includes analyzing the > kinds of mechanisms used, the power relations at work, the systems > controlling perceptions and information, the kinds of harms inflicted on the > victims, and the reasons why this oppression is so hard to see even by > contributing agents. Research and theory development on social oppression has advanced apace since the 1980s with the publication of seminal books and articles, and the cross- pollination of ideas and discussion among diverse disciplines, such as: feminism, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and political science. Nonetheless, more fully understanding the problem remains an extremely complicated challenge for scholars. Improved understanding will likely involve, for example, comprehending more completely the historical antecedents of current social oppression; the commonalities (and lack thereof) among the various social groups damaged by social oppression (and the individual human beings who make up those groups); and the complex interplay between and amongst sociocultural, political, economic, psychological, and legal forces that cause and support oppression. Social oppression Social oppression is when a single group in society unjustly takes advantage of, and exercises power over, another group using dominance and subordination. This results in the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals by those with relative power.Van Wormer, K., & Besthorn, F. H. (2010). Human behavior and the social environment, macro level: Groups, communities, and organizations. Oxford University Press. In a social group setting, oppression may be based on many ideas, such as poverty, gender, class, race, or other categories. Oppression by institution, or systematic oppression, is when the laws of a place create unequal treatment of a specific social identity group or groups. Another example of social oppression is when a specific social group is denied access to education that may hinder their lives in later life. Economic oppression is the divide between two classes of society. These were once determined by factors such slavery, property rights, disenfranchisement, and forced displacement of livelihood. Each divide yielded various treatments and attitudes towards each group. Social oppression derives from power dynamics and imbalances related to the social location of a group or individual. Social location, as defined by Lynn Weber, is \\"an individual's or a group's social 'place' in the race, class, gender and sexuality hierarchies, as well as in other critical social hierarchies such as age, ethnicity, and nation\\". An individual's social location often determines how they will be perceived and treated by others in society. Three elements shape whether a group or individual can exercise power: the power to design or manipulate the rules and regulations, the capacity to win competitions through the exercise of political or economic force, and the ability to write and document social and political history.Ferguson, S. J. (Ed.). (2015). Race, Gender, Sexuality, and Social Class: Dimensions of Inequality and Identity. SAGE Publications. There are four predominant social hierarchies, race, class, gender and sexuality, that contribute to social oppression. Privilege Lynn Weber, among some other political theorists, argues that oppression persists because most individuals fail to recognize it; that is, discrimination is often not visible to those who are not in the midst of it. Privilege refers to a sociopolitical immunity one group has over others derived from particular societal benefits. Many of the groups who have privilege over gender, race, or sexuality, for example, can be unaware of the power their privilege holds. These inequalities further perpetuate themselves because those who are oppressed rarely have access to resources that would allow them to escape their maltreatment. This can lead to internalized oppression, where subordinate groups essentially give up the fight to get access to equality, and accept their fate as a non-dominant group. Racial oppression Race or racial oppression is defined as: \\" ...burdening a specific race with unjust or cruel restraints or impositions. Racial oppression may be social, systematic, institutionalized, or internalized. Social forms of racial oppression include exploitation and mistreatment that is socially supported.\\" United States history consists of five primary forms of racial oppression including genocide and geographical displacement, slavery, second-class citizenship, non-citizen labor, and diffuse racial discrimination.Blauner, B. (1972). Racial oppression in America. Harpercollins College Div. The first, primary form of racial oppression‚Äîgenocide and geographical displacement‚Äîin the US context refers to Western Europe and settlers taking over an Indigenous population's land. Many Indigenous people, commonly known today as Native Americans, were relocated to Indian Reservations or killed during wars which were fought over possession of their land. The second form of racial oppression, slavery, refers to Africans being taken from their homeland and sold as property to white Americans. Racial oppression was a significant part of daily life in which African- Americans routinely worked on plantations and performed other forms of labor without pay or freedom to leave their workplaces. The third form of racial oppression, second-class citizenship, refers to some categories of citizens having fewer rights than others. Second-class citizenship became a pivotal form of racial oppression in the United States following the Civil War, as African-Americans who were formerly enslaved continued to be considered unequal to white citizens, and had no voting rights. Moreover, immigrants and foreign workers in the US are also treated like second-class citizens, with fewer rights than people born in the US. The fourth form of racial oppression in American history, non-citizen labor, refers to the linkage of race and legal citizenship status. During the middle of the 19th century, some categories of immigrants, such as Mexicans and Chinese, were sought as physical laborers, but were nonetheless denied legal access to citizenship status. The last form of racial oppression in American history is diffuse discrimination. This form of racial oppression refers to discriminatory actions that are not directly backed by the legal powers of the state, but take place in widespread everyday social interactions. This can include employers not hiring or promoting someone on the basis of race, landlords only renting to people of certain racial groups, salespeople treating customers differently based on race, and racialized groups having access only to impoverished schools. Even after the civil rights legislation abolished segregation, racial oppression is still a reality in the United States. According to Robert Blauner, author of Racial Oppression in America, \\"racial groups and racial oppression are central features of the American social dynamic\\". Class oppression Class oppression, sometimes referred to as classism, can be defined as prejudice and discrimination based on social class. Class is an unspoken social ranking system which is based on income, wealth, education, status, and power. A class is a large group of people who share similar economic or social positions based on their income, wealth, property ownership, job status, education, skills, and power in the economic and political sphere. The most commonly used class categories include: upper class, middle class, working class, and poor class. A majority of people in the United States self-identify in surveys as middle class, despite vast differences in income and status. Class is also experienced differently depending on race, gender, ethnicity, global location, disability, and more. Class oppression of the poor and working class can lead to deprivation of basic needs and a feeling of inferiority to higher-class people, as well as shame towards one's traditional class, race, gender, or ethnic heritage. In the United States, class has become racialized leaving the greater percentage of people of color living in poverty. Since class oppression is universal among the majority class in American society, at times it can seem invisible, however, it is a relevant issue that causes suffering for many. Gender oppression Gender oppression is carried out through gender norms society has adopted. In some cultures today, gender norms suggest that masculinity and femininity are opposite genders, however it is an unequal binary pair, with masculinity being dominant and femininity being subordinate. \\"Many have argued that cultural practices concerning gender norms of child care, housework, appearance, and career impose an unfair burden on women and as such are oppressive.\\" According to feminist Barbara Cattunar, women have always been \\"subjected to many forms of oppression, backed up by religious texts which insist upon women's inferiority and subjugation\\". Femininity has always been looked down upon, perpetuated by socially constructed stereotypes, which has affected women's societal status and opportunity. In current society, sources like the media further impose gendered oppression as they shape societal views. Females in pop-culture are objectified and sexualized, which can be understood as degrading to women by depicting them as sex objects with little regard for their character, political views, cultural contributions, creativity or intellect. Some argue that feminism, or struggles for women's cultural, political and economic equality, has challenged gender oppression. Others, such as Christina Hoff Sommers and Camille Paglia, argue that modern \\"fourth wave\\" feminism is holding women back by cementing them in a culture of victimization. Gender oppression also takes place against trans, gender-non- conforming, gender queer, or non-binary individuals who do not identify with binary categories of masculine/feminine or male/female. Sexuality oppression Dominant societal views with respect to sexuality, and sex partner selection, have formed a sexuality hierarchy oppressing people who do not conform to heteronormativity. Heteronormativity is an underlying assumption that everyone in society is heterosexual, and those who are not are treated as different or even abnormal by society, excluded, oppressed, and sometimes subject to violence. Heterosexism also derives from societal views of the nuclear family which is presumed to be heterosexual, and dominated or controlled by the male partner. Social actions by oppressed groups such as LGBT movements have organized to create social change.  Religious persecution  Different types of religious symbols Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of individuals because of their religious beliefs. According to Iris Young oppression can be divided into different categories such as powerlessness, exploitation, and violence. The first category of powerlessness with regards to religious persecution exists when a group of people who follow one religion have less power than the followers of the dominant religion. An example of religious powerlessness existed during the 17th century when the Pilgrims, who wanted to escape the rule of the Church of England came to what is now called the United States. The pilgrims created their own religion which was another form of Protestantism, and after doing so they eventually passed laws in order to prevent other religions from prospering in their colony. The Pilgrims and the leaders of other communities where Protestants were in the majority used their power over legislatures to oppress followers of other religions in the United States. The second category of oppression: exploitation, has been seen in many different forms around the world when it comes to religion. The definition of exploitation is the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work. For example, during, and particularly after, the American Civil War, white Americans used Chinese immigrants in order to build the transcontinental railroads. During this time it was common for the Chinese immigrants to follow the religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, because of this the Chinese were considered different and therefore not equal to white Americans. Due to this view Chinese workers were denied equal pay, and they also suffered many hardships during the time which they spent working on the railroad. The third and most extreme category of oppression is violence. According to the Merriam Webster's dictionary, violence is \\"the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy\\". Acts of religious violence which are committed against people who practice a particular religion are classified as hate crimes. Since September 11th, 2001 the number of hate crimes which have been committed against Muslims in the United States has greatly increased. One such incident occurred on August 5, 2017 when three men bombed a Mosque because they felt that Muslims \\"'push their beliefs on everyone else'\\". Acts of religious violence are also committed against practitioners of other religions in addition to Islam.  Domination  Addressing social oppression on both a macro and micro level, feminist Patricia Hill Collins discusses her \\"matrix of domination\\". The matrix of domination discusses the interrelated nature of four domains of power, including the structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal domains. Each of these spheres works to sustain current inequalities that are faced by marginalized, excluded or oppressed groups. The structural, disciplinary and hegemonic domains all operate on a macro level, creating social oppression through macro structures such as education, or the criminal justice system, which play out in the interpersonal sphere of everyday life through micro-oppressions. Standpoint theory can help us to understand the interpersonal domain. Standpoint theory deals with an individual's social location in that each person will have a very different perspective based on where they are positioned in society. For instance, a white male living in America will have a very different take on an issue such as abortion than a black female living in Africa. Each will have different knowledge claims and experiences that will have shaped how they perceive abortion. Standpoint theory is often used to expose the powerful social locations of those speaking, to justify claims of knowledge through closer experience of an issue, and to deconstruct the construction of knowledge of oppression by oppressors. Institutionalized oppression \\"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one's membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions.\\" U.S. Capitol - oil painting by Allyn Cox - The Monroe Doctrine (1823), plus a quote from President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1940). (photograph: Architect of the Capitol) Institutionalized oppression allows for government, religious and business organizations and their employees to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon group identity. Dating back to colonization, the United States implemented the annihilation of Native Americans from lands that Euro-Americans wanted, and condoned the institution of slavery where Africans were brought to the 'New World' to be a source of free labor to expand the cotton and tobacco industry. Implementing these systems by the United States government was justified through religious grounding where \\"servants [were] bought and established as inheritable property\\". Although the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments freed African Americans, gave them citizenship, and provided them the right to vote, institutions such as some police departments continue to use oppressive systems against minorities. They train their officers to profile individuals based upon their racial heritage, and to exert excessive force to restrain them. Racial profiling and police brutality are \\"employed to control a population thought to be undesirable, undeserving, and under punished by established law\\". In both situations, police officers \\"rely on legal authority to exonerate their extralegal use of force; both respond to perceived threats and fears aroused by out-groups, especially‚Äî but not exclusively‚Äî racial minorities\\". For example, \\"blacks are: approximately four times more likely to be targeted for police use of force than their white counterparts; arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal activities at higher rates than their overall representation in the U.S. population; and are more likely to fear unlawful and harsh treatment by law enforcement officials\\". The International Association of Chiefs of Police collected data from police departments between the years 1995 and 2000 and found that 83% of incidents involving use-of-force against subjects of different races than the officer executing it involved a white officer and a black subject. Institutionalized oppression is not only experienced by people of racial minorities, but can also affect those in the LGBT community. Oppression of the LGBT community in the United States dates back to President Eisenhower's presidency where he passed Executive Order 10450 in April 1953 which permitted non-binary sexual behaviors to be investigated by federal agencies. As a result of this order, \\"More than 800 federal employees resigned or were terminated in the two years following because their files linked them in some way with homosexuality.\\" Oppression of the LGBT community continues today through some religious systems and their believers' justifications of discrimination based upon their own freedom of religious belief. States such as Arizona and Kansas passed laws in 2014 giving religious-based businesses \\"the right to refuse service to LGBT customers\\". The proposal of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (EDNA) offers full protection of LGBT workers from job discrimination; however, the act does not offer protection against religious-based corporations and businesses, ultimately allowing the LGBT community to be discriminated against in environments such as churches and religious-based hospitals. The LGBT community is further oppressed by the United States government with the passage of the First Amendment Defense Act which states, \\"Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order.\\" This act essentially allows for institutions of any kind‚Äîschools, businesses, hospitals‚Äîto deny service to people based upon their sexuality because it goes against a religious belief. Economic oppression The term economic oppression changes in meaning and significance over time, depending on its contextual application. In today's context, economic oppression may take several forms, including, but not limited to: serfdom, forced labour, low wages, denial of equal opportunity, bonded labour, practicing employment discrimination, and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, and religion.Kirst-Ashman, K. K., & Hull, G. H. (2012). Understanding Generalist Practice. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning. Ann Cudd describes the main forces of economic oppression as oppressive economic systems and direct and indirect forces. Even though capitalism and socialism are not inherently oppressive, they \\"lend themselves to oppression in characteristic ways\\".Cudd, Ann E. (2006). Analyzing Oppression. Oxford University Press US. . She defines direct forces of economic oppression as \\"restrictions on opportunities that are applied from the outside on the oppressed, including enslavement, segregation, employment discrimination, group-based harassment, opportunity inequality, neocolonialism, and governmental corruption\\". This allows for a dominant social group to maintain and maximize its wealth through the intentional exploitation of economically inferior subordinates. With indirect forces (also known as oppression by choice), \\"the oppressed are co-opted into making individual choices that add to their own oppression\\". The oppressed are faced with having to decide to go against their social good, and even against their own good. If they choose otherwise, they have to choose against their interests, which may lead to resentment by their group. An example of direct forces of economic oppression is employment discrimination in the form of the gender pay gap. Restrictions on women's access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an \\"inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations\\".Mupepi, Mambo (Ed.). (2016). Effective Talent Management Strategies for Organizational Success. Hershey: Business Science Reference. . In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016.Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, The Economics Daily, \\"Women's median earnings 82 percent of men's in 2016. https://www.bls.gov (visited April 21, 2017) Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the \\"ideal-worker norm,\\" which \\"defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight,\\" a situation designed for the male sex. Women, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the \\"ideal-worker norm\\". With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home.Kinnear, Karen L. (2011). Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook. ABC-Clio. . Others believe that this difference in wage earnings is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations.Magnusson, Charlotta. (2010). \\"Why Is There A Gender Wage Gap According To Occupational Prestige?\\" Acta Sociologica (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 53.2: 99-117. Academic Search Complete. Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that \\"over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females\\".Weichselbaumer, D. and Winter-Ebmer, R. (2005). A Meta-Analysis of the International Gender Wage Gap. Journal of Economic Surveys, 19: 479‚Äì511. Doi: 10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x Indirect economic oppression is exemplified when individuals work abroad to support their families. Outsourced employees, working abroad generally little to no bargaining power not only with their employers, but with immigration authorities as well. They could be forced to accept low wages and work in poor living conditions. And by working abroad, an outsourced employee contributes to the economy of a foreign country instead of their own. Veltman and Piper describe the effects of outsourcing on female laborers abroad: > Her work may be oppressive first in respects of being heteronomous: she may > enter work under conditions of constraint; her work may bear no part of > reflectively held life goals; and she may not even have the: freedom of > bodily movement at work. Her work may also fail to permit a meaningful > measure of economic independence or to help her support herself or her > family, which she identifies as the very purpose of her working.Veltman, A., > & Piper, M. (Eds.). (2014). Autonomy, Oppression, and Gender. Oxford > University Press. By deciding to work abroad, laborers are \\"reinforcing the forces of economic oppression that presented them with such poor options\\". Feminism and equal rights A woman breaking free of chains.Although a relatively modern form of resistance, feminism's origins can be traced back to the course of events which led up to the introduction of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in 1923. While the ERA was created in order to address the need for equal protection under the law for both men and women in the workplace, it spurred a rise in feminism which has come to represent women's search for equal opportunity and respect in patriarchal societies, across all social, cultural, and political spheres. Demonstrations and marches have been a popular medium of support, with the January 21, 2017, Women's March's replication in major cities across the world drawing tens of thousands of supporters. Feminists' main talking points consist of women's reproductive rights, the closing of the pay gap between men and women, the glass ceiling and workplace discrimination, and the intersectionality of feminism with other major issues such as African-American rights, immigration freedoms, and gun violence. \\"Resistance\\" Resistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society. Still, resistance to oppression has been largely overlooked in terms of the amount of research and number of studies completed on the topic, and therefore, is often largely misinterpreted as \\"lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness\\". Over the last two centuries, resistance movements have risen that specifically aim to oppose, analyze, and counter various types of oppression, as well as to increase public awareness and support of groups marginalized and disadvantaged by systematic oppression. Late 20th century resistance movements such as liberation theology and anarchism set the stage for mass critiques of, and resistance to, forms of social and institutionalized oppression that have been subtly enforced and reinforced over time. Resistance movements of the 21st century have furthered the missions of activists across the world, and movements such as liberalism, Black Lives Matter and feminism are some of the most prominent examples of resistance to oppression today.

He was one of the leading members of the German Expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). He lived during a particularly innovative time for German art: he saw the development of the main German Expressionist movements as well as the arrival of the successive avant-garde movements which were forming in the rest of Europe. Like a true artist of his time, Macke knew how to integrate into his painting the elements of the avant-garde which most interested him. Early life Street with church in Kandern, 1911 August Robert Ludwig Macke was born in Germany on 3 January 1887, in Meschede, Westphalia. He was the only son of August Friedrich Hermann Macke (1845‚Äì1904), a building contractor and amateur artist, and his wife, Maria Florentine, n√©e Adolph, (1848‚Äì1922), who came from a farming family in Westphalia's Sauerland region. Shortly after August's birth the family settled at Cologne, where Macke was educated at the Kreuzgymnasium (1897-1900) and became a friend of Hans Thuar, who would also become an artist. In 1900, when he was thirteen, the family moved to Bonn, where Macke studied at the Realgymnasium and became a friend of Walter Gerhardt and Gerhardt's sister, Elisabeth, whom he would marry a few years later. The first artistic works to make an impression on the boy were his father's drawings, the Japanese prints collected by his friend Thuar's father and the works of Arnold B√∂cklin which he saw on a visit to Basel in 1900. In 1904 Macke's father died, and in that year Macke enrolled at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, under Adolf Maennchen (1904-1906). During this period he also took evening classes under Fritz Helmut Ehmke (1905), did some work as a stage and costume designer at the Schauspielhaus D√ºsseldorf, and visited northern Italy (1905) and Netherlands, Belgium and Britain (1906). Artistic career 1907‚Äì1914 Rokoko,1912, oil on canvas, 89 x 89 cm, National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Norway Tightrope walker, 1913 Thereafter Macke lived most of his creative life in Bonn, with the exception of a few periods spent at Lake Thun in Switzerland and various trips to Paris, Italy, the Netherlands and Tunisia. In Paris, where he traveled for the first time in 1907, Macke saw the work of the Impressionists, and shortly after he went to Berlin and spent a few months in Lovis Corinth's studio. His style was formed within the mode of French Impressionism and Post-impressionism and later went through a Fauve period. In 1909 he married Elisabeth Gerhardt. In 1910, through his friendship with Franz Marc, Macke met Kandinsky and for a while shared the non-objective aesthetic and the mystical and symbolic interests of Der Blaue Reiter. Macke's meeting with Robert Delaunay in Paris in 1912 was to be a sort of revelation for him. Delaunay's chromatic Cubism, which Apollinaire had called Orphism, influenced Macke's art from that point onwards. His Shops Windows can be considered a personal interpretation of Delaunay's Windows, combined with the simultaneity of images found in Italian Futurism. The exotic atmosphere of Tunisia, where Macke traveled in April 1914 with Paul Klee and Louis Moilliet was fundamental for the creation of the luminist approach of his final period, during which he produced a series of works now considered masterpieces. August Macke's oeuvre can be considered as Expressionism (in its original German flourishing between 1905 and 1925), and also as part of Fauvism. The paintings concentrate primarily on expressing feelings and moods rather than reproducing objective reality, usually distorting colour and form. Macke's career was cut short by his early death in the second month of the First World War at the front in Champagne, France, on 26 September 1914. His final painting, Farewell, depicts the mood of gloom that settled after the outbreak of war. This was also the same year that he painted the famous painting T√ºrkisches Caf√© in M√ºnchen (1914).

Besides the village of Brienz, the municipality includes the settlements of Kienholz and Axalp. Politically, the municipality is located in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district of the canton of Bern. History A western view of Lake Brienz in the summer, taken from the quay at Brienz An eastern view of Lake Brienz The first settlements date from the neolithic and Bronze Ages. In the 5th century BC, the Celts settled in the alpine valleys among the sources of the Rhone, the Rhine and the Danube, eventually stretching from the headwaters down to Vienna and Belgrade. At the end of 1st century BC the Romans conquered this area. The Roman settlements were destroyed by the Alamanni in 259/60. They eventually settled in the area around 450. In any case, evidence has been found for a settlement by the Alamanni in the 7th century. Brienz is first mentioned in 1146 as Briens. In 1528, after an eventful history, Brienz became part of the Canton of Bern. Lake Brienz has probably been in use as a transport route since pre-history, but the first steamship was introduced in 1839, operating a route between Interlaken and Brienz. In 1888, the metre gauge Br√ºnig railway opened between Brienz and Alpnachstad, on Lake Lucerne. Brienz therefore became, for a while, a transfer point on a hybrid ship and rail route from Interlaken to Lucerne. By 1916 the Br√ºnig railway had been extended to Interlaken along the north shore of the lake, and Brienz found itself simply an intermediate stop on a through rail route. Geography Brienz village from the Brienzer Rothorn. Aerial view (1956) The municipality of Brienz includes a number of communities along the upper end of Lake Brienz, and stretches into the neighboring mountains. It includes the village of Brienz on the right shore, the mouth of the Aare and the village of Kienholz to the north and the settlements of Engi and Schwendi on the left bank. Heading away from the right shore the land rises to the Rotschalp, Planalp and Giebelegg before reaching the Brienzer Rothorn (). Heading away from the left shore it rises over the Brienzerberg and Giessbach Falls, Tschingelfeld, Hinterburg and Axalp until it reaches the Schwarzhorn (). The parish of Brienz includes Oberried am Brienzersee, Schwanden bei Brienz, Hofstetten bei Brienz and Brienzwiler. Brienz has an area of .

William Middendorf. Saipan's operational career began in July 1979 when she was diverted from Fleet Refresher Training to Special Contingency Operations, for possible non-combatant evacuation of American personnel from the Nicaraguan Revolution. 1980s From February to April 1980, Saipan was involved in Anorak Express 80. The Navy crew of around 800 and an entire Marine battalion of over 2,000 sailed from Norfolk to Norway. In May, Saipan was underway to augment U.S. Coast Guard efforts to assist Cuban refugees crossing the Straits of Florida to the United States during the Mariel boatlift. On 25 August, Saipan departed Norfolk for the first Mediterranean deployment by an LHA. On 3 September 1981, Saipan deployed for her second tour in the Mediterranean Sea. During that deployment, Saipan visited or operated in seven countries on three continents. From August 1982 through July 1983, Saipan was in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her first scheduled complex overhaul. In September 1983, while undergoing Refresher Training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Saipan was diverted to participate in Operation Urgent Fury off Grenada.

The ship returned in September 1993 and began her third scheduled complex overhaul in April 1994. In June 1996, Saipan deployed to the Mediterranean and participated in Operation Decisive Endeavor and various multi-national training exercises. She returned to Norfolk in December 1996. Saipan departed on her seventh deployment to the Mediterranean in July 1998. Saipan spent substantial operating time in the Adriatic Sea due to turmoil in Albania. On 28 July 1998 Saipan went to the rescue of the motor yacht MY Huntress which was burning approximately southwest of Corfu and east of Nisos Island (sic). The crew and guests were saved, but Huntress burned and sank despite damage control efforts of Saipan.

The ship commenced Adriatic presence operations during the Fall of 2000 federal elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 12 February 2001, Saipan entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for its fourth scheduled complex overhaul. On 10 January 2003, Saipan was deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terrorism. From late January 2005 until early March 2005, Saipan was on a scheduled deployment to the U.S. Southern Command (NAVSO) area of responsibility in support of New Horizons, the humanitarian civic assistance efforts in Haiti. In early June, she made an official visit to Oslo on the occasion of Norway's independence centennial. During the week of 26 June 2005, Saipan was one of two American military vessels (the other being ) to participate in the Royal Navy International Fleet Review in the waters off Portsmouth, England. This review, conducted by Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Royal Family, consisted of a parade of more than 166 ships from around the world. This event also coincided with the 2005 International Festival of the Sea and Trafalgar 200 celebration. In May 2006, Saipan sailed for the Mediterranean to take part in multi- national training exercises during Operation Phoenix Express which involved the countries of Spain, Morocco, and Algeria. She returned to Norfolk in July. From 16 August, Saipan deployed to the Persian Gulf region in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for her final operational deployment. She returned to Norfolk on 22 December. Decommissioning Saipan was decommissioned on 20 April 2007 at her home port in Naval Station Norfolk with Captain Richard Fitzpatrick in command. She was used for weapons effect testing, providing vital information on structural integrity and survivability which will assist in the designing and planning of future ships. She was transferred to the inactive fleet, and was tied up at Pier 4 of the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, where she was joined by ex- on 22 March 2008. On 30 September 2009, a contract to dismantle Saipan was issued to International Shipbreaking Ltd, Brownsville, Texas and on 28 October 2009 the ship departed Philadelphia under tow. International Shipbreaking completed scrapping Saipan on 23 February 2011. USS Saipan awards  Saipan at Philadelphia Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in January 2008.

Haskins circa 1900 Charles Homer Haskins (December 21, 1870 ‚Äì May 14, 1937) was a history professor at Harvard University. He was an American historian of the Middle Ages, and advisor to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. He is widely recognized as the first academic medieval historian in the United States. Biography Haskins was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania.Charles Homer Haskins The rise of universities, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1923, 1957, p. v. He was a prodigy, fluent in both Latin and Greek while still a young boy, taught by his father. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University at the age of 16, and then studied in Paris and Berlin. He received a Ph.D. in history from Johns Hopkins University and began teaching there before the age of 20. In 1890, he was appointed instructor at the University of Wisconsin, became a full professor in two years, and from 1892‚Äì1902 held the European history chair there.F. M. Powicke, \\"Charles Homer Haskins\\", The English Historical Review, vol. 52, no. 208 (Oct., 1937), p. 649. In 1902 he moved to Harvard University, where he taught until 1931. Haskins became politically involved enough to become a close advisor of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, whom he had met at Johns Hopkins. When Wilson attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 where the Treaty of Versailles was drawn up, he brought only three advisors including Haskins, who served as chief of the Western European division of the American commission. He died on May 14, 1937 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His widow died in 1970. Legacy He was primarily a historian of institutions, like medieval universities and governments. His works reflect the mostly twentieth-century optimistic, liberal view that progressive government by \\"the best and brightest\\" is the way to go. His histories of medieval Europe's institutions stress the efficiency and successes of their governing bureaucracies, implicitly analogous to those of modern nation states. Haskins's most well known pupil was medieval historian Joseph Strayer, who went on to teach many American medievalists of the next generation(s) at Princeton University, some still active today. Other eminent medievalists trained by Haskins included Lynn White, Jr. (UCLA), Gaines Post (Wisconsin and Princeton), Carl Stephenson (Cornell), Edgar B. Graves (Hamilton College), and John R. Williams (Dartmouth). The Haskins Society, named in his honor was organized in 1982, a \\"Founding Father\\" being the late C. Warren Hollister. It publishes an annual Journal whose volume 11 (2003) reconsidered Haskins' magnum opus seventy years after its publication. From 1920 to 1926, he was also the first chairman of the American Council of Learned Societies, which still offers a distinguished lecture series named after him. His son George Haskins was a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor. Renaissance of the Twelfth Century Haskins' most famous work is The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (1927). The word \\"Renaissance,\\" even to historians in the early 20th century, meant the 15th-century Italian Renaissance, as defined by 19th-century Swiss historian Jakob Burckhardt in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy. Haskins opened a broader view when he asserted, \\"The continuity of history rejects violent contrasts between successive periods, and modern research shows the Middle Ages less dark and less static, the Renaissance less bright and less sudden, than was once supposed. The Italian Renaissance was preceded by similar, if less wide-reaching, movements.\\" Haskins' fresh assessment of a sort of pre-renaissance, ushering in the High Middle Ages around 1070, was resisted by some scholars at first. His approach was broader than a mere literary revival: he stated in his preface that he found that 12th-century Europe \\"was in many respects an age of fresh and vigorous life. The epoch of the Crusades, of the rise of towns, and of the earliest bureaucratic states of the West, saw the culmination of Romanesque art and the beginnings of Gothic art; the emergence of vernacular literatures; the revival of the Latin classics and of Latin poetry and Roman law; the recovery of Greek science, with its Arabic additions, and of much of Greek philosophy; and the origin of the first European universities. The twelfth century left its signature on higher education, on scholastic philosophy, on European systems of law, on architecture and sculpture, on the liturgical drama, on Latin and vernacular poetry.... We shall confine ourselves to the Latin side of this renaissance, the revival of learning in the broadest sense‚Äîthe Latin classics and their influence, the new jurisprudence and the more varied historiography, the new knowledge of the Greeks and Arabs and its effects upon western science and philosophy.\\" Haskins focused on high culture to prove that the 12th century was indeed a period of dynamic growth. He looked at the history of art and science, the universities, philosophy, architecture and literature, and provided a celebratory view of the period. More recent views of the renewal have expanded the focus.Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, eds., Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century Once the ice had been broken, other scholars concentrated on an earlier, more constrained revival of learning in some circles under the patronage of Charlemagne, and began talking and thinking of a \\"Carolingian Renaissance\\" of the ninth century. By 1960, Erwin Panofsky could write of Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art. Less wide-ranging was Haskins' earlier study of the Normans, Norman Institutions (1918), which still forms the basis of current scholarly understanding of how medieval Normandy functioned. He also wrote the more popular book The Normans in European History (1915). Works * The Yazoo Land Companies. New York: The Knickerbocker Press, 1891. * A History of Higher Education in Pennsylvania.

Stecyk III (a.k.a. Craig Stecyk), Greg Escalante, and Eric Swenson to both help define and celebrate urban alternative and underground contemporary art. Juxtapoz is published by High Speed Productions, the same company that publishes Thrasher skateboard magazine in San Francisco, California. Scope Juxtapoz launched with the mission of connecting modern genres like psychedelic and hot rod art, graffiti, street art, and illustration, to the context of broader more historically recognized genres of art like Pop, assemblage, old master painting, and conceptual art. Although based in San Francisco, Juxtapoz was founded upon the belief in the virtues of Southern California pop culture and freedom from the conventions of the \\"established\\" New York City art world. Ferus Gallery, run by Walter Hopps and Irving Blum in the 1950s and 1960s, was the ultimate cultural touchstone for the magazine. Juxtapoz originally reflected Williams' own Kustom Kulture sensibility ‚Äì a combination of California \\"Big Daddy\\" Ed Roth‚Äìstyle pop surrealism (identified by some as synonymous with lowbrow art and others as its own genre) and the serious figurative craftsmanship that is more likely to be found among illustrators than fine artists today. Growth Juxtapoz expanded its range in the early 2000s to cover other nascent styles and subgenres of underground art. Artists who have received coverage in Juxtapoz include KAWS, Mark Ryden, Barry McGee, Todd Schorr, Tara McPherson, Camille Rose Garcia, Tim Biskup, Michael Pearce and Tom Sachs. As of 2009, Juxtapoz had the largest circulation of any art magazine in the United States, more than established counterparts like Art News, Art in America, and ArtForum. In addition to printed subscriptions which offer alternative cover images to the newsstand version, Juxtapoz is also available as an online digital subscription. Evan Pricco is the editor-in- chief.

The British colonial rulers developed the town as a hill station, and served as the summer capital of Bombay Presidency during the British Raj.  Geography  Mahabaleshwar is located at . It has an average elevation of . Located about southwest of Pune and from Mumbai, Mahabaleshwar is a vast plateau measuring , bound by valleys on all sides. It reaches a height of at its highest peak above sea level, known as Wilson/Sunrise Point. Mahabaleshwar comprises three villages: Malcolm Peth, Old \\"Kshetra\\" Mahabaleshwar and part of the Shindola village. Mahabaleshwar is the source of the Krishna River that flows across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The legendary source of the river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in the ancient temple of Mahadev in Old Mahabaleshwar. Legend has it that Krishna is Lord Vishnu himself as a result of a curse on the trimurtis by Savitri. Also, its tributaries Venna and Koyna are said to be Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma themselves. An interesting thing to notice is that 3 other rivers come out from the cow's mouth apart from Krishna and they all travel some distance before merging into Krishna which flows East towards the Bay of Bengal. These rivers are the Koyna, Venna (Veni) and Gayatri. The Savitri river flows Westward via Mahad to the Arabian Sea. Climate of the area is suitable for cultivation of strawberries, Mahabaleshwar strawberry contributes to about 85 percent of the total strawberry production in the country.Mahableshwar-where strawberries grow:https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/mahabaleshwar--where- strawberries-grow/1757666Strawberry fields forever:https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/unwind/strawberry- fields-forever/articleshow/74419558.cms It also received the geographical indication (GI) tag in 2010. Panoramic view of Mahabaleshwar Panoramic view from Savitri Point, Mahabaleshwar  Climate  Very heavy rainfall is a normal occurrence during monsoons. During July, 10‚Äì12 days of continuous rains with 100‚Äì200 mm rains each day can be seen each year.  History  On the outskirts of Mahabaleshwar, towards Panchgani. The first historical mention of Mahabaleshwar dates back to year 1215 when the King Singhan of Deogiri visited Old Mahabaleshwar. He built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. Around 1350, a Brahmin dynasty ruled this area. In the middle of the 16th century the Maratha family of Chandarao More defeated the Brahmin dynasty and became rulers of Javli and Mahabaleshwar, during which period Old Mahabaleshwar temple was rebuilt. In 1656, the founder of Maratha empire, Shivaji under controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near Mahabaleshwar,from him. Around that time shivaji also built a fort near Mahabaleshwar called Pratapgad.The fort remains in the hands of Shivaji's descendants to this day. British colonial era In 1819, after the demise of the Maratha empire, the victorious British ceded the hills around Mahabaleshwar to the vassal state of Satara. Colonel Lodwick (Later General Sir Lodwick) after climbing the mountains near Mahabaleshwar, recommended the place as a sanatorium for the British forces to governor Sir John Malcolm of Bombay presidency. The Raja of Satara was granted other villages in exchange for the British getting Mahabaleshwar in 1828. In old records Mahabaleshwar was even called as Malcolm Peth after the governor. Mahabaleshwar started gaining prominence when British officials of Bombay presidency such as in 1828, and later Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone, Arthur Malet (for whom the seat at \\"Point Arthur\\" is named), Carnac, and many others became regular visitors. A lake called Venna lake was constructed in 1842 to collect water from perennial springs.The Venna river flows from this lake.Puri, G.S. and Mahajan, S.D., 1960. The study of the evergreen vegetation of Mahabaleshwar area. Nelumbo, 2(1-2), pp.109-137. Bartley Frere, the commissioner of Satara in 1850s built the road from Satara to Mahabaleshwar. In mid 1800s, Mahabaleshwar was made into summer capital of Bombay presidency. Government spending led to rapid development of the area.Colonial officials spent part of their year in the area.Their wives spent longer period to be with their children in local boarding schools in Mahabaleshwar and nearby Panchgani.Baker, K., 2009.

The British rulers wanted to recreate the English landscape in the hill stations and to that end, European flora such as strawberriesMahabaleshwar strawberry gets GI status  Business Standard News were introduced in Mahabaleshwar, and amenities such as libraries,theatres, boating lakes, and sports grounds constructed. Added to the scores of magnificent scenic \\"points\\", the perennial springs, streams, and waterfalls of Mahabaleshwar plateau, with its year round superb climate, drew the English and others to Mahabaleshwar. By the end of the 19th century it had become an attractive popular hill station of world renown. Raj Bhavan, the Summer residence of the Governor of Maharashtra, is also located here. An older building named \\"The Terraces\\" was purchased in 1884 and rechristened as Giri Darshan in 1886. Map of the region (1881) \\"Babington House\\", is a colonial-style bungalow built in the shape of a cross with a deep veranda, elaborate metal work railing and extensive outhouses. It was formerly one of the country seats of the Dubash family, a Parsi ship chandler dynasty from Bombay who sold it to the Rahejas in the early 1970s. It contains a central dining room with a 24-seater table and a library pavilion with 1st edition books collected by the Dubash family, notably Jamsetjee \\"Jimmy\\" Kavasjee Dubash, a bibliophile and art collector.

Each glomerulus is surrounded by a heterogeneous population of juxtaglomerular neurons (that include periglomerular, short axon, and external tufted cells) and glial cells. All glomeruli are located near the surface of the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb also includes a portion of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the cells of which contribute fibers to the olfactory tract.Morris, H., & Schaeffer, J. P. (1953).

They are the initial sites for synaptic processing of odor information coming from the nose. A glomerulus is made up of a globular tangle of axons from the olfactory receptor neurons, and dendrites from the mitral and tufted cells, as well as, from cells that surround the glomerulus such as the external tufted cells, periglomerular cells, short axon cells, and astrocytes. In mammals, glomeruli typically range between 50-120 ¬µm in diameter and number between 1100 and 2400 depending on the species, with roughly between 1100 and 1200 in humans. The number of glomeruli in a human decreases with age; in humans that are over 80 they are nearly absent.R.L Doty. Neurobiology of Disease (2012). Each glomerulus is composed of two compartments, the olfactory nerve zone and the non-olfactory nerve zone. The olfactory nerve zone is composed of preterminals and terminals of the olfactory nerve and is where the olfactory receptor cells make synapses on their targets. The non-olfactory nerve zone is composed of the dendritic processes of intrinsic neurons and is where dendrodendritic interactions between intrinsic neurons occur. Anatomy Glomeruli are important waystations in the pathway from the nose to the olfactory cortex and have been found to be critical for odorant signal transduction. The olfactory receptor neurons (ORN), which originate in the nasal epithelium express only one type of olfactory receptor (OR). These ORNs then project their axons to the olfactory bulb. In the olfactory bulb, the ORNs synapse with termination in the glomeruli. Each glomerulus receives input from olfactory receptor neurons expressing only one type of olfactory receptor. The glomerular activation patterns within the olfactory bulb are thought to represent the quality of the odor being detected. These activation patterns of glomeruli can change due to changes in airflow rate and odor concentration in the mucus layer of the nasal cavity. A certain odorant can activate a glomeruli strongly whilst affecting others with less efficiency to very little at all. Linda Buck and Richard Axel were awarded a Nobel prize in 2004 for heavily influencing the working out of the genetic basis for this Olfactory coding. The current dogma is that axons from all ORNs expressing the same receptor converge onto one or two glomeruli of a possible 1800 glomeruli in each olfactory bulb. As the axons of the ORNs migrate towards their specific glomeruli they often overshoot into neighboring glomeruli. Thus, a glomerulus representing a specific OR develops slowly and involves considerable axonal reorganization in order to achieve the highly topographical projection observed in adult mice. Function The glomerulus is the basic unit in the odor map of the olfactory bulb. Each odor activates a different pattern of glomeruli, such that, simply by analyzing the different sets of activated glomeruli, one could, in theory, decode the identity of the odor. This odor map, however, is modified by the circuitry within the olfactory bulb so that the spiking pattern of the second-order mitral cells is usually different from that of the olfactory sensory neurons. Other species Glomerulus in Dogs The glomerulus process in dogs is divided in 3 parts. signal acquisition, signal transduction, and signal processing. Some dogs have as many as 100 times more ORNs than humans do, producing a correspondingly sharpened ability to detect and discriminate among millions of odors. Characteristics of these stages include: the role of olfactory plume and sniffing, the continuous renewal of Glomerulus receptors throughout the life cycle, and the relationship between the olfactory neuron and the glomerulus, and finally, the synthetic nature of glomerulus coding. Glomerulus in Fish One of the most distinctive features of fish olfaction is that it takes place entirely in the aquatic environment. The carrier of stimulant is water and therefore the chemicals must be soluble in water. The olfactory epithelium of fish consists of three cell types, like other vertebrates. These three cell types are the receptor cells, supporting cells and basal cells. Fish glomerulus differs from the mammalian glomerulus in terms of the number of dendrites that it receives from the mitral cells. In a mammalian olfactory system, a single dendrite from a mitral cell enters a single glomerulus. However, in fish, one or more dendrites from mitral cells enter one or more glomerulus.

It was originally released for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox on January 13, 2004. Barry Sanders of the Detroit Lions, Shannon Sharpe of the Denver Broncos, and Ricky Williams of the Miami Dolphins grace the cover. The game was followed by NFL Street 2 and NFL Street 3. Gameplay Similar to the Blitz series, Street is seven-on-seven American football, modeled roughly after its informal variant, street football. NFL Players in the game wear street clothing instead of helmets and uniforms (although the players can wear football jerseys). Like other American Football games, NFL Street has basic football rules, but the gameplay has no fouls and low penalty, naturally leading to much more aggressive gameplay than its real- life model. However, to maintain the \\"IronMan\\" status, there are no injuries in the game. One important feature in the game is \\"style points\\", which the player can earn by successfully completing style moves (which includes making a huge play or taunting the other team during the game). Enough style points will earn the player a \\"Gamebreaker\\", which lasts for the entire drive. The Gamebreaker concept was taken from NBA Street. An offensive Gamebreaker allows the player to plow through defenders and easily score a touchdown. On defense, it allows the player to easily get through their opponents blockers, cause fumbles, and possibly create a turnover. While difficult, it is possible to cancel a Gamebreaker by stopping your opponent from scoring. Additionally a Gamebreaker may be canceled if the player activates his while his opponent's is already activated. In this situation, both Gamebreakers are canceled. It is also possible to stop a defensive Gamebreaker by running out of bounds. Game modes Quick Game ‚Äî In this mode you select a team and play a quick game against either the computer or a friend. The scoring system can be in touchdowns or style points, depending on the choice of the player. Pickup Game ‚Äî A Pickup Game is the same as a Quick Game, but instead of choosing a team, you and your opponent create teams from a pool of around 40 NFL players, some of which are Legends. In game, the teams are referred as \\"Team One\\" and \\"Team Two\\". Regulation Pickup Games of NFL Street allow each team one redraft (also called a \\"Re\\") if one team believes the random assortment of players available in the draft are not up to par. However, if both teams have used their redraft, another redraft can be done if both teams dislike the draft. This is known in the NFL Street community as \\"Mutual Garb.\\" NFL Challenge ‚Äî This is the main mode in the game. You create a team, from logo to players height, and go through a series of challenges against other teams, unlocking new football stadiums, teams, equipment, and development points for improving your team by completing several challenges that vary in their difficulty All NFL Pickup ‚Äî To unlock this mode, you must first beat the NFL Challenge mode. The same features apply as in Pickup Game, but instead of a 40 player pool, you can select from any of the players in the game, including Legends. You can choose 1-2 players from any team except from the cheat code teams. Rosters The rosters are based on the 2003 NFL roster, with some earlier players as NFL Legends. Reception By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of NFL Street had sold 950,000 copies and earned $37 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 58th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of NFL Street games released in the 2000s reached 2 million units in the United States by July 2006. NFL Street received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Maxim gave the game all five stars and said the player can \\"dispense with kicking and doodle-heavy playbooks, and deploy between-the-leg laterals and double reverses, plus a mess of excellent unsportsmanlike, showboating taunts.\\" The Village Voice gave the Xbox version a score of nine out of ten and said, \\"In the surprisingly good single-player \\"NFL Challenge\\" mode, you earn points to build a franchise, choosing everything from the players' mutated genes (10 attributes, plus size) to their speed-enhancing sneakers. 'Cause it ain't all about the steroids.\\" However, Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B and said, \\"This pigskin sim fumbles by forcing players to run their amateur team against the pros in order to unlock better fields and additional players - a clear case of unnecessary roughness.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"a fun, simplistic diversion, especially with a group of friends. However, once you've seen all the style moves it doesn't have the staying power of much deeper football games like EA's own Madden NFL 2004.\\" David Leonard of PopMatters critiqued the game's depiction of African-American men, comparing the \\"emphasis on savagery, violence and animalistic features\\" to those used in the controversial first-person shooter Ethnic Cleansing.

This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. This circumstance arises when the rate at which data is requested is slower than the rate it is consumed or, in other words, more time is spent requesting data than processing it.Identifying disk I/O-bound systems I/O bound as an inherent problem in computing The I/O bound state has been identified as a problem in computing almost since its inception. The Von Neumann architecture, which is employed by many computing devices, this involves multiple possible solutions such as implementing a logically separate central processor unit which along with storing the instructions of the program also retrieves actual data usually from main memory and makes use of this more accessible data for working. When the process is terminated it writes back the results to the original storage (usually the main memory). Since data must be moved between the CPU and memory along a bus which has a limited data transfer rate, there exists a condition that is known as the Von Neumann bottleneck. Put simply, this means that the data bandwidth between the CPU and memory tends to limit the overall speed of computation. In terms of the actual technology that makes up a computer, the Von Neumann Bottleneck predicts that it is easier to make the CPU perform calculations faster than it is to supply it with data at the necessary rate for this to be possible. In recent history, the Von Neumann bottleneck has become more apparent. The design philosophy of modern computers is based upon a physically separate CPU and main memory. It is possible to make the CPU run at a high data transfer rate because data is moved between locations inside them across tiny distances. The physical separation between CPU and main memory, however, requires a data bus to move data across comparatively long distances of centimetres or more. The problem of making this part of the system operate sufficiently fast to keep up with the CPU has been a great challenge to designers.Erik Engbrecht's Blog: What does I/O bound really mean? I/O bound as a practical problem The I/O bound state is considered undesirable because it means that the CPU must stall its operation while waiting for data to be loaded or unloaded from main memory or secondary storage. With faster computation speed being the primary goal of new computer designs and components such as the CPU and memory being expensive, there is a strong imperative to avoid I/O bound states and eliminating them can yield a more economic improvement in performance than upgrading the CPU or memory. As CPU gets faster, processes tend to get more I/O-bound Or in simpler terms: As CPU gets faster, processes tend to not increase in speed in proportion to CPU speed because they get more I/O-bound. This means that I/O bound processes are slower than non-I/O bound processes, not faster. This is due to increases in the rate of data processing in the core, while the rate at which data is transferred from storage to the processor does not increase with it. As CPU clock speed increases, allowing more instructions to be executed in a given time window, the limiting factor of effective execution is the rate at which instructions can be delivered to the processor from storage, and sent from the processor to their destination. In short, programs naturally shift to being more and more I/O bound. Comparison with CPU-bound Assume we have one CPU- bound process and many I/O-bound processes. As the processes flow around the system, the following scenario may result. The CPU-bound process will get and hold the CPU. During this time, all the other processes will finish their I/O and will move into the ready queue, waiting for the CPU. While the processes wait in the ready queue, the I/O devices are idle. Eventually, the CPU-bound process finishes its CPU burst and moves to an I/O device. All the I/O-bound processes, which have short CPU bursts, execute quickly and move back to the I/O queues. At this point, the CPU sits idle. The CPU-bound process will then move back to the ready queue and be allocated the CPU. Again, all the I/O processes end up waiting in the ready queue until the CPU-bound process is done. There is a convoy effect as all the other processes wait for the one big process to get off the CPU. This effect results in lower CPU and device utilization than might be possible if the shorter processes were allowed to go first.

The term has been extended to a generic, often punning extension, upmanship, used for any assertion of superiority: for instance, photon upmanship, Native Upmanship, and so on. The term was first used in the title of a book by Stephen Potter, published in 1952In full, One- Upmanship: Being Some Account of the Activities and Teachings of the Lifemanship Correspondence College of One-Upness and Games Lifemastery. as a follow-up to The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship (or the Art of Winning Games without Actually Cheating) (1947), and Lifemanship titles in his series of tongue-in-cheek self-help books, and film and television derivatives, that teach various ploys to achieve this. This comic satire of self-help style guides manipulates traditional British conventions for the gamester, all life being a game, who understands that if you're not one-up, you're one-down. Potter's unprincipled principles apply to almost any possession, experience or situation, deriving maximum undeserved rewards and discomfitting the opposition. The 1960 film School for Scoundrels and its 2006 remake were satiric portrayals of how to use Potter's ideas. In that context, the term refers to a satiric course in the gambits required for the systematic and conscious practice of \\"creative intimidation\\", making one's associates feel inferior and thereby gaining the status of being \\"one-up\\" on them. Viewed seriously, it is a phenomenon of group dynamics that can have significant effects in the management field: for instance, manifesting in office politics.

The duties of the position vary from country to country. It is also the name of a symbolic rod, which represents the authority of the tipstaff or other officials such as senior police officers. club after which the office is named) on display at Bedford Museum History Police tipstaffs in West Midlands Police Museum The office of the Tipstaff is thought to have been created in the 14th century. One of the earliest records of the Tipstaff was mentioned in 1570: \\"The Knight Marshall with all hys tippe staves\\". It is a position of both law enforcement and ceremonial duties. An earlier mention of tipstaff is in 1555 when the Rev'd Rowland Taylor was burned at the stake during the reign of Queen Mary I for his religious views that were contrary to those of Lord Chancellor Gardiner. Foxe's Book of Martyrs states that Taylor would have spoken to the people but as soon as he opened his mouth the yeoman of the guard thrust a tipstaff into his mouth, and would in no way permit him to speak. This is also quoted in Five English Reformers by J. C. Ryle.Five English Reformers, page 85. 1961, Banner of Truth Trust publishers. First published in \\"Light from Old Times\\", 1890. The name originates from the early law enforcement officers who would arrest by beating them with a tipped staff or stave. The staff was made of wood or metal or both, topped with a crown. The crown, which unscrewed, could be removed to reveal inside the hollow staff a warrant appointing the holder to their position of authority. Some staffs were definitely a means of protection and this is where the present day policeman's baton, or truncheon, originates. Examples remain at the Royal Courts of Justice and the Metropolitan Police museum in London and vary depending on the type and rank of officer. These tipstaves were first carried in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. When detectives (in plain clothes) were first authorised, the tipstaves issued to plainclothes officers from 1867 were re-issued in 1870 engraved \\"Metropolitan Police officer in plain clothes\\". The staff kept at the Royal Courts of Justice is now only used on ceremonial occasions. It is 12 inches in length and made of ebony decorated with a silver crown and three bands of silver engraved with the Royal Arms at the top. Around the middle is inscribed \\"AMOS HAWKINS, TIPSTAFF COURTS OF CHANCERY\\" and around the bottom is inscribed \\"Appointed 14th January, 1884, by the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Selborne, L.C.\\" with another coat of Royal Arms. The date was that on which this staff was first used, soon after the Law Courts were opened. Prior to 1884, each Tipstaff had their own staff, which they retained when they retired. Crossed tipstaffs within a wreath - rank of police assistant chief constable or commander in the UK As a symbol The emblem of two crossed tipstaves (tipstaffs) within a wreath appears on the rank insignia of senior police officers in several Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. In Canada, the emblem is used for the most senior officers of the Ontario Provincial Police and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. Current usage Australia In Australia, a tipstaff is roughly equivalent to a law clerk in the United States. The term is used principally in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and in the County Court of Victoria United Kingdom =England and Wales= There are currently two Tipstaves in England and Wales: one is an officer of the Royal Borough of Kingston and the other an officer of the High Court of England and Wales, appointed under section 27 of the Courts Act 1971. It is the latter to which this section refers. The High Court Tipstaff may appoint three assistants and can call on any constable, bailiff or member of the public to assist in carrying out their duties. Their jurisdiction extends throughout England and Wales. They are authorised to force entry if necessary, and will have a police officer present to prevent breach of the peace. The relevant territorial police force is informed of arrests. Sometimes a local bailiff or police will detain a person in custody until the Tipstaff arrives to collect them and take them to court or prison. Pentonville Prison (for civil offenders) is obliged to take into custody‚Äö no matter what the circumstances‚Äö anybody taken there by the Tipstaff. Tipstaff may make the same demands of the custody suite within the Royal Courts of Justice itself, and they are obliged to take into custody any individual he brings there. The Tipstaff heads a procession of the Lord Chancellor and judges at the start of the legal year‚Äö preceding them with their staff as a symbol of authority and law enforcement. They also lead the Lord Mayor from their golden coach to the Lord Chief Justice's Court for the \\"swearing in\\" of the Lord Mayor‚Äö afterwards attending the Lord Mayor's Banquet, having led the Lord Chancellor into the Guildhall. The black uniform‚Äö only worn on ceremonial occasions‚Äö is based on that of a Victorian police inspector. They wear a black hat with gold braid trimmings and jacket with silver buttons‚Äö a wing collar with a white bow tie and white gloves. The Tipstaff is the only person authorised to make an arrest within the precincts of the Royal Courts of Justice. Every applicable order made in the High Court is addressed to the Tipstaff: \\"I hereby command you the Tipstaff and your assistants in Her Majesty's name to take and safely convey and deliver the said ... to the Governor of Her Majesty's Prison ...\\"(as in the case of making an arrest). The majority of their work involves taking children into custody (i.e. a place of safety)‚Äö including cases of child abduction abroad. In child abduction cases, there may be a 'seek and locate' order backed by a bench warrant ordering any person with knowledge of the child to give that information to the Tipstaff or to their deputy or assistants. Related orders may require the alleged abductor to hand their passport and other travel documents to the Tipstaff, and order the Tipstaff to take the child and deliver them to a designated place. There may also be a 'port alert' executed by the Tipstaff, to help prevent the child being taken abroad. In the case of children who have been declared a ward of court i.e. where the court is acting in loco parentis, the Tipstaff has a role in ensuring that those children are delivered to the locations specified by the court. =Northern Ireland= Tipstaffs and Court Criers in Northern Ireland have no enforcement role, but act as personal assistants to High Court and County Court judges. United States In some states of the United States, the Tipstaff is called a Tipstave and is responsible for courtroom decorum. Their position is similar to that of a bailiff. The Civil Division of the Municipal Court of Philadelphia employs Tipstaves as clerks to the court. The Criminal Trial Division employs Tipstaves in positions commonly referred to as Court officers.

When he was seven, his father, a clerk in a land surveying office, died, and Nikolai moved with his mother to Kazan. Lobachevsky attended Kazan Gymnasium from 1802, graduating in 1807 and then received a scholarship to Kazan University, which was founded just three years earlier in 1804. At Kazan University, Lobachevsky was influenced by professor Johann Christian Martin Bartels, a former teacher and friend of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Lobachevsky received a Master of Science in physics and mathematics in 1811. In 1814, he became a lecturer at Kazan University, in 1816 he was promoted to associate professor. In 1822, at the age of 30, he became a full professor, teaching mathematics, physics, and astronomy. He served in many administrative positions and became the rector of Kazan University in 1827. In 1832, he married Varvara Alexeyevna Moiseyeva. They had a large number of children (eighteen according to his son's memoirs, while only seven apparently survived into adulthood). He was dismissed from the university in 1846, ostensibly due to his deteriorating health: by the early 1850s, he was nearly blind and unable to walk. He died in poverty in 1856 and was buried in Arskoe Cemetery, Kazan. On his religious views, he was said to be an atheist.. Career Lobachevsky's main achievement is the development (independently from J√°nos Bolyai) of a non- Euclidean geometry, also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry. Before him, mathematicians were trying to deduce Euclid's fifth postulate from other axioms. Euclid's fifth is a rule in Euclidean geometry which states (in John Playfair's reformulation) that for any given line and point not on the line, there is only one line through the point not intersecting the given line. Lobachevsky would instead develop a geometry in which the fifth postulate was not true. This idea was first reported on February 23 (Feb. 11, O.S.), 1826 to the session of the department of physics and mathematics, and this research was printed as On the Origin of Geometry (–û –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞—Ö –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏–∏) in 1829‚Äì1830 (Kazan University Course Notes). In 1829 Lobachevsky wrote a paper about his ideas called \\"A Concise Outline of the Foundations of Geometry\\" that was published by the Kazan Messenger but was rejected when it was submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences for publication. The non-Euclidean geometry that Lobachevsky developed is referred to as hyperbolic geometry. Lobachevsky replaced Playfair's axiom with the statement that for any given point there exists more than one line that can be extended through that point and run parallel to another line of which that point is not part. He developed the angle of parallelism which depends on the distance the point is off the given line. In hyperbolic geometry the sum of angles in a hyperbolic triangle must be less than 180 degrees. Non-Euclidean geometry stimulated the development of differential geometry which has many applications. Hyperbolic geometry is frequently referred to as \\"Lobachevskian geometry\\" or \\"Bolyai‚ÄìLobachevskian geometry\\". Some mathematicians and historians have wrongly claimed that Lobachevsky in his studies in non-Euclidean geometry was influenced by Gauss, which is untrue. Gauss himself appreciated Lobachevsky's published works very highly, but they never had personal correspondence between them prior to the publication. Although three people‚ÄîGauss, Lobachevsky and Bolyai‚Äîcan be credited with discovery of hyperbolic geometry, Gauss never published his ideas, and Lobachevsky was the first to present his views to the world mathematical community. Lobachevsky's magnum opus Geometriya was completed in 1823, but was not published in its exact original form until 1909, long after he had died. Lobachevsky was also the author of New Foundations of Geometry (1835‚Äì1838). He also wrote Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels (1840)The 1914 English translation by George Bruce Halsted is available at and Pangeometry (1855).The 1902 German translation by Heinrich Liebmann is available at Lobachevsky dictated two versions of that work, a first one in Russian, and a second one in French (Papadopoulos 2010, p. v). Another of Lobachevsky's achievements was developing a method for the approximation of the roots of algebraic equations. This method is now known as the Dandelin‚ÄìGr√§ffe method, named after two other mathematicians who discovered it independently. In Russia, it is called the Lobachevsky method. Lobachevsky gave the definition of a function as a correspondence between two sets of real numbers (Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet gave the same definition independently soon after Lobachevsky). Impact E. T. Bell wrote about Lobachevsky's influence on the following development of mathematics in his 1937 book Men of Mathematics: > The boldness of his challenge and its successful outcome have inspired > mathematicians and scientists in general to challenge other \\"axioms\\" or > accepted \\"truths\\", for example the \\"law\\" of causality which, for centuries, > have seemed as necessary to straight thinking as Euclid's postulate appeared > until Lobachevsky discarded it.

He was abducted and beheaded according to a video released in May 2004 by Islamist militants in response to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse involving the United States Army and Iraqi prisoners. The CIA claimed Berg was murdered by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The decapitation video was released on the internet, reportedly from London to a Malaysian-hosted homepage by the Islamist organization Muntada al-Ansar.  Early life and education  Berg grew up in West Whiteland Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He was referred to as a \\"religious Jew.\\" Berg graduated from Henderson High School in West Chester in 1996. In 1996, he was a student at Cornell University but later dropped out. He took classes at Drexel University in 1998, and in 1999, Berg attended summer sessions on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. At some point, Berg took a class at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. He never earned a college degree. In 2002, with family members, Berg created Prometheus Methods Tower Service. He inspected and rebuilt communication antennas, and had previously visited Kenya and Uganda on similar projects. Berg set up a subsidiary of his company, Prometheus Tower Services, Inc., in Kenya.  Travels and detention  Berg first arrived in Iraq on 21 December 2003, and made arrangements to secure contract work for his company. He also went to the northern city of Mosul, visiting an Iraqi man whose brother had been married to Berg's late aunt. Leaving on 1 February 2004, he returned to Iraq on 14 March 2004, only to find that the work he was promised was unavailable. Throughout his time in Iraq, he maintained frequent contact with his family in the United States by telephone and e-mail. Berg had intended to return to the United States on 30 March 2004, but he was detained in Mosul on March 24. His family claims that he was turned over to U.S. officials and held for 13 days without access to legal counsel. FBI agents visited his parents to confirm his identity on March 31, 2004, but he was not immediately released. After his parents filed suit in federal court in Philadelphia on April 5, 2004, claiming that he was being held illegally, he was released from custody. He said that he had not been mistreated during his confinement. The U.S. maintains that at no time was Berg in coalition custody, but rather that he was held by Iraqi forces. The Mosul police deny they ever arrested Berg, and Berg's family has turned over an email from the U.S. consul stating \\"I have confirmed that your son, Nick, is being detained by the U.S. military in Mosul.\\", WKRN According to the Associated Press, Berg was released from custody on April 6, 2004 and advised by U.S. officials to take a flight out of Iraq, with their assistance. Berg is said to have refused this offer and traveled to Baghdad, where he stayed at the Al-Fanar Hotel. His family last heard from him on April 9, 2004. Berg had his last contact with U.S. officials on April 10, 2004 and did not return again to his hotel after that date. He was interviewed for filmmaker Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11.Moore interviewed Berg for \\"Fahrenheit\\", Salon (magazine), May 27, 2004 Moore chose not to use the footage of his interview with Berg, but instead shared it with Berg's family following his death.  Disappearance  Berg's family became concerned after not hearing from him for several days. Although a U.S. State Department investigator looked into Berg's disappearance, official government inquiries produced no leads. His family, frustrated with what they say was a lack of action by the U.S. government, also hired a private investigator and contacted both their Congressional delegation and the Red Cross in search of information. According to The Guardian it is unclear how Berg came to be kidnapped.  Death  Berg's body was found decapitated on May 8, 2004, on a Baghdad overpass by a U.S. military patrol. Berg's family was informed of his death two days later. Military sources stated publicly at the time that Berg's body showed \\"signs of trauma\\", but did not disclose that he had been decapitated. On May 11, 2004, the website of the militant jihadist group Muntada al-Ansar\\\\- website where decapitation video was first posted, now offline. See posted a video with the opening title of \\"Abu Musab al- Zarqawi slaughters an American\\", which shows Berg being decapitated. The video is about five and a half minutes long. The video shows Nick Berg, seated, facing the camera and his captors standing behind him also facing the camera. Berg is wearing an orange jumpsuit, similar to ones worn by prisoners in U.S. custody. His captors are all masked, their identities concealed. He identifies himself: \\"My name is Nick Berg, my father's name is Michael, my mother's name is Suzanne. I have a brother and sister, David and Sarah. I live in West Chester, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.\\" A lengthy statement is read aloud. The masked men then converge on Berg. Two of them hold him down, while one decapitates him with a knife. The video title claims the decapitator was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,Die Welt , 20 November 2014. but this can't be determined as all the men are masked. A scream can be heard as men shout \\"God is Great\\". After the head is severed, one of the men displays the head to the camera, then lays it down on the decapitated body. During the video, the masked man reading the statement said the killing was in revenge for the abuse at Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. The man says Muslims should seek vengeance for Abu Ghraib, and that the Muslim clergy had been complacent. The man also threatens further deaths, and makes specific threats to U.S. President George W. Bush and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Media in America and around the world grappled with the question of how much graphics to print. The Dallas Morning News showed an image in which the killer holds Nick Berg's severed head, while Seattle Times only displayed the image of the killer. British newspaper The Independent urged restraint, arguing the video was propaganda and publishing images from it \\"plays into the hands\\" of terrorists. Reactions The death of Nick Berg provoked condemnation in the United States, and the Arab World. Berg's killing was condemned by the Arab League, and United Nations, as well as by the United States, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the U.A.E, and Hezbollah. Many others in the Muslim world also condemned the killing, and BBC journalist Paul Wood found that the \\"Arab street\\" condemned the killing of Berg, saw it as contrary to Islam, and saw it as a reaction to US prison abuses.  Encounter with Zacarias Moussaoui  On May 14, 2004, it was revealed that Nick Berg had been investigated during the U.S. government's investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui, a 9/11 conspirator. Berg's email address had been used by Moussaoui prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks. According to Berg's father, Nick Berg had a chance encounter with an acquaintance of Moussaoui on a bus in Norman, Oklahoma. This person had asked to borrow Berg's laptop computer to send an email. Berg gave the details of his own email account and password, which were later used by Moussaoui. The FBI found that Berg had no direct terrorism connections or direct link with Moussaoui.Berg's encounter with 'terrorist' revealed, CNN, May 14, 2004  Arrests and confessions  On May 14, 2004, citing \\"Iraq sources\\", Sky News reported that four people had been arrested for the murder. Two were later released. Alternatively, on July 5, 2004, Sky News reported that four men were arrested in connection with the Nick Berg decapitation. On August 5, 2004, Le Nouvel Observateur published a feature story by Sara Daniel detailing her meeting with one Abu Rashid, a leader of the mujahadeen council in Fallujah. He claims that he killed Nick Berg, Kim Sun-il and Iraqis who collaborated with U.S. forces. He also states that they attempted a prisoner exchange with Berg and were rebuffed by the U.S. officials.

Frankl describes it as \\"the Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy\\"Gordon Allport, from the Preface to Man's Search for Meaning, p. xiv along with Freud's psychoanalysis and Adler's individual psychology. Logotherapy is based on an existential analysis focusing on Kierkegaard's will to meaning as opposed to Adler's Nietzschean doctrine of will to power or Freud's will to pleasure. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to this system is given in Frankl's most famous book, Man's Search for Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and reinforced his theories. Presently, there are a number of logotherapy institutes around the world. Basic principles The notion of Logotherapy was created with the Greek word logos (\\"reason\\"). Frankl's concept is based on the premise that the primary motivational force of an individual is to find a meaning in life. The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy: * Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. * Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life. * We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering. The human spirit is referred to in several of the assumptions of logotherapy, but the use of the term spirit is not \\"spiritual\\" or \\"religious\\". In Frankl's view, the spirit is the will of the human being. The emphasis, therefore, is on the search for meaning, which is not necessarily the search for God or any other supernatural being. Frankl also noted the barriers to humanity's quest for meaning in life. He warns against \\"...affluence, hedonism, [and] materialism...\\" in the search for meaning. Purpose in life and meaning in life constructs appeared in Frankl's logotherapy writings with relation to existential vacuum and will to meaning, as well as others who have theorized about and defined positive psychological functioning. Frankl observed that it may be psychologically damaging when a person's search for meaning is blocked. Positive life purpose and meaning was associated with strong religious beliefs, membership in groups, dedication to a cause, life values, and clear goals. Adult development and maturity theories include the purpose in life concept. Maturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life's purpose, directedness, and intentionality which contributes to the feeling that life is meaningful. Frankl's ideas were operationalized by Crumbaugh and Maholick's Purpose in Life (PIL) test, which measures an individual's meaning and purpose in life. With the test, investigators found that meaning in life mediated the relationships between religiosity and well- being; uncontrollable stress and substance use; depression and self- derogation. Crumbaugh found that the Seeking of Noetic Goals Test (SONG) is a complementary measure of the PIL. While the PIL measures the presence of meaning, the SONG measures orientation towards meaning. A low score in the PIL but a high score in the SONG, would predict a better outcome in the application of Logotherapy. Discovering meaning According to Frankl, \\"We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering\\" and that \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äì to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances\\". On the meaning of suffering, Frankl gives the following example: > \\"Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe > depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two > years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now how could I help him? > What should I tell him? I refrained from telling him anything, but instead > confronted him with a question, \\"What would have happened, Doctor, if you > had died first, and your wife would have had to survive without you?:\\" \\"Oh,\\" > he said, \\"for her this would have been terrible; how she would have > suffered!\\" Whereupon I replied, \\"You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been > spared her, and it is you who have spared her this suffering; but now, you > have to pay for it by surviving and mourning her.\\" He said no word but shook > my hand and calmly left the office. Frankl emphasized that realizing the value of suffering is meaningful only when the first two creative possibilities are not available (for example, in a concentration camp) and only when such suffering is inevitablehe was not proposing that people suffer unnecessarily. Philosophical basis of logotherapy Frankl described the meta-clinical implications of logotherapy in his book The Will to Meaning: Foundations and Applications of Logotherapy. He believed that there is no psychotherapy apart from the theory of the individual. As an existential psychologist, he inherently disagreed with the ‚Äúmachine model‚Äù or ‚Äúrat model‚Äù, as it undermines the human quality of humans. As a neurologist and psychiatrist, Frankl developed a unique view of determinism to coexist with the three basic pillars of logotherapy (the freedom of will). Though Frankl admitted that a person can never be free from every condition, such as, biological, sociological, or psychological determinants; based on his experience during his life in the Nazi concentration camps, he believed that a person is ‚Äúcapable of resisting and braving even the worst conditions‚Äù. In doing such, a person can detach from situations and themselves, choose an attitude about themselves, and determine their own determinants, thus shaping their own character and becoming responsible for themselves. Logotherapeutic views and treatment Overcoming anxiety By recognizing the purpose of our circumstances, one can master anxiety. Anecdotes about this use of logotherapy are given by New York Times writer Tim Sanders, who explained how he uses its concept to relieve the stress of fellow airline travelers by asking them the purpose of their journey. When he does this, no matter how miserable they are, their whole demeanor changes, and they remain happy throughout the flight. Overall, Frankl believed that the anxious individual does not understand that their anxiety is the result of dealing with a sense of ‚Äúunfulfilled responsibility‚Äù and ultimately a lack of meaning. Treatment of neurosis Frankl cites two neurotic pathogens: hyper-intention, a forced intention toward some end which makes that end unattainable; and hyper-reflection, an excessive attention to oneself which stifles attempts to avoid the neurosis to which one thinks oneself predisposed. Frankl identified anticipatory anxiety, a fear of a given outcome which makes that outcome more likely. To relieve the anticipatory anxiety and treat the resulting neuroses, logotherapy offers paradoxical intention, wherein the patient intends to do the opposite of their hyper- intended goal. A person, then, who fears (i.e. experiences anticipatory anxiety over) not getting a good night's sleep may try too hard (that is, hyper-intend) to fall asleep, and this would hinder their ability to do so. A logotherapist would recommend, then, that the person go to bed and intentionally try not to fall asleep. This would relieve the anticipatory anxiety which kept the person awake in the first place, thus allowing them to fall asleep in an acceptable amount of time. Depression Viktor Frankl believed depression occurred at the psychological, physiological, and spiritual levels. At the psychological level, he believed that feelings of inadequacy stem from undertaking tasks beyond our abilities. At the physiological level, he recognized a ‚Äúvital low‚Äù, which he defined as a ‚Äúdiminishment of physical energy‚Äù. Finally, Frankl believed that at the spiritual level, the depressed individual faces tension between who they actually are in relation to what they should be. Frankl refers to this as the gaping abyss. Finally Frankl suggests that if goals seem unreachable, an individual loses a sense of future and thus meaning resulting in depression. Thus logotherapy aims ‚Äúto change the patient‚Äôs attitude toward their disease as well as toward their life as a task‚Äù. Obsessive-compulsive disorder Frankl believed that those suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder lack the sense of completion that most other individuals possess. Instead of fighting the tendencies to repeat thoughts or actions, or focusing on changing the individual symptoms of the disease, the therapist should focus on ‚Äútransform[ing] the neurotic‚Äôs attitude toward their neurosis‚Äù. Therefore, it is important to recognize that the patient is ‚Äúnot responsible for his obsessional ideas‚Äù, but that ‚Äúhe is certainly responsible for his attitude toward these ideas‚Äù. Frankl suggested that it is important for the patient to recognize their inclinations toward perfection as fate, and therefore, must learn to accept some degrees of uncertainty. Ultimately, following the premise of logotherapy, the patient must eventually ignore their obsessional thoughts and find meaning in their life despite such thoughts. Schizophrenia Though logotherapy wasn't intended to deal with severe disorders, Frankl believed that logotherapy could benefit even those suffering from schizophrenia. He recognized the roots of schizophrenia in physiological dysfunction. In this dysfunction, the person with schizophrenia ‚Äúexperiences himself as an object‚Äù rather than as a subject. Frankl suggested that a person with schizophrenia could be helped by logotherapy by first being taught to ignore voices and to end persistent self-observation. Then, during this same period, the person with schizophrenia must be led toward meaningful activity, as ‚Äúeven for the schizophrenic there remains that residue of freedom toward fate and toward the disease which man always possesses, no matter how ill he may be, in all situations and at every moment of life, to the very last‚Äù. Terminally ill patients In 1977, Terry Zuehlke and John Watkins conducted a study analyzing the effectiveness of logotherapy in treating terminally ill patients. The study's design used 20 male Veterans Administration volunteers who were randomly assigned to one of two possible treatments ‚Äì (1) group that received 8 45-minute sessions over a 2-week period and (2) group used as control that received delayed treatment. Each group was tested on 5 scales ‚Äì the MMPI K Scale, MMPI L Scale, Death Anxiety Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Purpose of Life Test. The results showed an overall significant difference between the control and treatment groups. While the univariate analyses showed that there were significant group differences in 3/5 of the dependent measures. These results confirm the idea that terminally ill patients can benefit from logotherapy in coping with death. Forms of Treatment ECCE HOMO is a method used in logotherapy. It requires of the therapist to note the innate strengths that people have and how they have dealt with adversity and suffering in life. Despite everything a person may have gone through, they made the best of their suffering! Hence, Ecce Homo - Behold the Man! Frankl, Viktor E.. The Will to Meaning (p. 94). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. Controversy Authoritarianism In 1969 Rollo May argued that logotherapy is, in essence, authoritarian. He suggested that Frankl's therapy presents a plain solution to all of life's problems, an assertion that would seem to undermine the complexity of human life itself. May contended that if a patient could not find their own meaning, Frankl would provide a goal for his patient. In effect, this would negate the patient's personal responsibility, thus ‚Äúdiminish[ing] the patient as a person‚Äù. (First Edition 1961) Frankl explicitly replied to May's arguments through a written dialogue, sparked by Rabbi Reuven Bulka‚Äôs article ‚ÄúIs Logotherapy Authoritarian?‚Äù. Frankl responded that he combined the prescription of medication, if necessary, with logotherapy, to deal with the person's psychological and emotional reaction to the illness, and highlighted areas of freedom and responsibility, where the person is free to search and to find meaning. Religiousness Critical views of the life of logotherapy's founder and his work assume that Frankl's religious background and experience of suffering guided his conception of meaning within the boundaries of the person and therefore that logotherapy is founded on Viktor Frankl's worldview. Frankl openly spoke and wrote on religion and psychiatry, throughout his life, and specifically in his last book, Man‚Äôs Search for Ultimate Meaning (1997). He asserted that every person has a spiritual unconscious, independently of religious views or beliefs, yet Frankl's conception of the spiritual unconscious does not necessarily entail religiosity. In Frankl's words: ‚ÄúIt is true, Logotherapy, deals with the Logos; it deals with Meaning. Specifically, I see Logotherapy in helping others to see meaning in life. But we cannot ‚Äúgive‚Äù meaning to the life of others. And if this is true of meaning per se, how much does it hold for Ultimate Meaning?‚Äù The American Psychiatric Association awarded Viktor Frankl the 1985 Oskar Pfister Award (for important contributions to religion and psychiatry).  Recent developments  Since the 1990s, the number of institutes providing education and training in logotherapy continues to increase worldwide. Numerous logotherapeutic concepts have been integrated and applied in different fields, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance- and commitment therapy (ACT), and burnout prevention. The logotherapeutic concepts of noogenic neurosis and existential crisis were added to the ICD 11 under the name demoralisation crisis, i.e. a construct that features hopelessness, meaninglessness, and existential distress as first described by Frankl in the 1950s. Logotherapy has also been associated with psychosomatic and physiological health benefits. Besides Logotherapy, other meaning-centered psychotheraeutic approaches such as positive psychology and meaning therapy have emerged.Wong, P. T. P. (1997).

The word derives from the Latin words manus, meaning \\"hand\\" and portare, meaning \\"to carry\\". Examples include stones or shells moved from coastal or riverine areas or pebbles found in alien geological contexts. Some have been attributed to pre-human hominines applying significance to pleasingly shaped natural objects such as the Makapansgat pebble, as well as to later societies.

The area is named after the mound constructed in the early 18th century by Henry James Brydges, Earl of Carnarvon and first Duke of Chandos. He had a summer house built atop the mound for the wonderful view. The mound, or mount, is now the Stanmore Golf Course. Belmont is a suburban residential district and was formerly served by Belmont station, on a railway single-line branch running from Harrow & Wealdstone station to Stanmore Village railway station. The line was known locally as The Rattler, a term first coined by Pete Knobbler. The site of the station is now a car park. What may remain of the platform and track lies beneath tons of earth and rubble used to bring the car park up to street level. The Belmont Trail is a nature trail between Wealdstone and Stanmore running along much of the original track route. The circle was originally made for a tram line that would go across London. Its 4 exits were made due to this.https://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/9632158.Health_walk_across_Belmont_s_old_railway_line/ Belmont Circle provides the main focus of the area, being a large, circular parade of that intersects Kenton Lane.

Sectarian violence and/or sectarian strife is a form of communal violence which is inspired by sectarianism, that is, between different sects of one particular mode of an ideology or religion within a nation/community. Religious segregation often plays a role in sectarian violence.  Concept  According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute: Sectarian violence differs from the concept of race riot. It may involve the dynamics of social polarization, the balkanization of a geographic area along the lines of self- identifying groups, and protracted social conflict. Some of the possible enabling environments for sectarian violence include power struggles, political climate, social climate, cultural climate, and economic landscape. *Economic conflict: capitalist versus collectivist *Political conflict: communist versus nationalist *Interreligious conflict: Christians and/or Catholics versus Jews Muslim versus Christian Muslim versus Buddhist *Christian conflict: Catholic versus Protestant *Islamic conflict: Shia versus Sunni Among Christians Catholic-Eastern Orthodox Although the First Crusade was initially launched in response to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for help in repelling the invading Seljuq Turks from Anatolia, one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to \\"further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other.\\" European wars of religion The Battle of the White Mountain in Bohemia (1620)‚Äîone of the decisive battles of the Thirty Years War Following the onset of the Protestant Reformation, a series of wars were waged in Europe starting circa 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to Miroslav Volf, the European wars of religion were a major factor behind the \\"emergence of secularizing modernity\\". In the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre followers of the Roman Catholic Church killed up to 30,000 Huguenots (French Protestants) in mob violence. The massacres were carried out on the national day celebrating Bartholomew the Apostle. Pope Gregory XIII sent the leader of the massacres a Golden Rose, and said that the massacres \\"gave him more pleasure than fifty Battles of Lepanto, and he commissioned Giorgio Vasari to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican\\". The killings have been called \\"the worst of the century's religious massacres\\", and led to the start of the fourth war of the French Wars of Religion. Northern Ireland A modern Protestant mural in Belfast celebrating Oliver Cromwell and his activities. Since the 16th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. Northern Ireland has seen inter-communal conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for absentee landlords, aspiring politicians, and members of the landed gentry stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late 18th century. William E.H. Lecky, an Irish historian, wrote in 1892 that, \\"If the characteristic mark of a healthy Christianity be to unite its members by a bond of fraternity and love, then there is no country where Christianity has more completely failed than Ireland\\". Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote; John Hickey wrote; The period from 1969-98 is known as \\"The Troubles\\", a period of frequent violence and tense relations between Northern Ireland's communities. About one in eight females and one in five males in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to no religion.NI Life & Times Survey, 2015 results on religion, ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018. However, people of no religion and non-Christian faiths are still considered as belonging to one of the two \\"sects\\" along with churchgoers. People of no religion are less likely to support the main, constitution- oriented main political parties, or more likely to support a more neutral political party such as the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.NI Life & Times Survey, 2015 results on political party support, ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018. About two thirds of people with no religion tend to think of themselves as neither unionist or nationalist, although a much higher percentage of those with no religion tend to think of themselves as unionist than nationalist.NI Life & Times Survey, 2015 results on political identity, ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018. For people who describe themselves as Protestant or Roman Catholic, a small majority of them appear to favour one of the two main political parties on either side: the Democratic Unionist Party or the Ulster Unionist Party for Protestants; and Sinn F√©in or the Social Democratic and Labour Party for Roman Catholics. In each case, the percentage in the Northern Irish Life & Times Survey in 2015 was 57%. Roman Catholics are more likely to reject the label British (59%) than Protestants are to reject the label Irish (48%).NI Life & Times Survey, 2015 results on identity, ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018. Protestants are more likely to consider the British identity as the 'best' single way to describe themselves, at 67%, with Roman Catholics close behind at 63% who consider the best single way to describe themselves as Irish. There is an equal level of support for the more neutral Northern Irish identity, with 25% of people from each religion likely to choose that label as the best description. Over a third of people with no religion prefer to be described as Northern Irish.NI Life & Times Survey, 2015 results on best identity, ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018. There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The Corrymeela Community (in Ballycastle, County Antrim), operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The Ulster Project works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the United States to provide safe, non-denominational environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities. Although state schools in Northern Ireland are non-denominational, most Catholic parents still send their children to specifically Catholic schools or Irish-language medium schools, thus ensuring that state school students are almost wholly Protestant. There are some integrated schools and the Society of Friends (Quakers) have long been an advocate of co-education in terms of religion, operating the Friends' School in Lisburn (first established in 1774). Yugoslav wars Howard Goeringer criticizes both the \\"Catholic Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch\\" for failing to condemn the \\"deliberate massacre of men, women and children in the name of 'ethnic cleansing' as incompatible with Jesus' life and teaching.\\" Rwandan genocide The majority of Rwandans, and Tutsis in particular, are Catholic, so shared religion did not prevent genocide. Miroslav Volf cites a Roman Catholic bishop from Rwanda as saying, \\"The best cathechists, those who filled our churches on Sundays, were the first to go with machetes in their hands\\". Ian Linden asserts that \\"there is absolutely no doubt that significant numbers of prominent Christians were involved in sometimes slaughtering their own church leaders.\\"Linden, I. (1997). The Church and Genocide. Lessons from the Rwandan Tragedy. In G. Baum (Ed.), The Reconciliation of Peoples. Challenge to the Churches (pp. 43‚Äì55). Geneva: WCC Publications. According to Volf, \\"what is particularly disturbing about the complicity of the church is that Rwanda is without doubt one of Africa‚Äôs most evangelized nations. Eight out of ten of its people claimed to be Christians.\\" When the Roman Catholic missionaries came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the \\"Hamitic\\" theory of race origins, which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between Hutu and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu.Dictionary of Genocide, Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) report on the genocide states, > In the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic > missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century > Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial > ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country's Tutsi minority, > since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values > were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandans‚Ä¶ The Roman Catholic Church argues that those who took part in the genocide did so without the sanction of the Church. Although the genocide was ethnically motivated and religious factors were not prominent, Human Rights Watch reported that a number of religious authorities in Rwanda, particularly Roman Catholic, failed to condemn the genocide publicly at the time. Some Christian leaders have been convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for their roles in the genocide.Dictionary of Genocide\\", Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, These include Rwandan Roman Catholic priests and nuns as well as a Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor. Scotland Scotland, which is very close to Northern Ireland, suffers from a spill-over of sectarianism, largely owing to the Troubles in Northern Ireland as many people, particularly in the West of Scotland, have links to Northern Ireland by genealogy or immigration. Scotland's two largest and best supported football clubs -- Glasgow Rangers, which, for many generations, has largely been identified with Protestants and unionism, and Glasgow Celtic, which, since its founding in the late 19th century, has been identified with Roman Catholics and Irish nationalism or republicanism‚Äîboth subscribe, with varying degrees of success, to government initiatives and charities like the Nil by Mouth campaign are working in this area. Celtic previously sent letters to every season ticket holder reminding supporters that no form of sectarianism is welcome at Celtic Park. Rangers' anti-sectarian policy is called Follow With Pride. Among Muslims Sectarian violence between the two major sects of Islam, Shia and Sunni, has occurred in countries like Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Lebanon etc. This violent conflict has roots in the political turmoil arising out of differences over the succession to Muhammad. Abu Bakr, a companion of Muhammad, was nominated by Umar and elected as the first Sunni Rightly Guided Caliph. However another group felt that Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, had been designated by Muhammad and is considered by Shia as the first Imam. According to Sunnis, Abu Bakr was followed by Umar as caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, then by Uthman ibn Affan and finally by Ali. Ali's right to rule was challenged by Muawiyah bin Abu Sufian, governor of Syria, who believed that Ali should have acted faster against the murderers of Uthman. The situation deteriorated further when many of those responsible for the death of Uthman rallied behind Ali. However, later on, both the parties agreed to have some one as a judge between them. This led to the separation of an extremist group known as Kharijites from Ali's army, which pronounced the judgement belonged to God alone. A member of this group later assassinated Ali. By breaching, Hasan-Muawiyah Treaty, Muawiyah appointed his son Yazid as his successor. The credentials and rule of Yazid were challenged by Ali's son Hussein ibn Ali (and grandson of Muhammad). A battle at Karbala in Iraq led to the martyrdom of Hussein and dozens of others from Ahl al-Bayt (the members of the family of Muhammad). This tragic incident created deep fissures in the Muslim society. The conflict that had started at a political plane intervened with the dogma and belief systems. Those who consider Ali to be the true heir to the Muhammad are known as \\"Shia\\" referring to Shian-e-Ali. The other Muslims are known as \\"Sunni\\" meaning \\"followers of the Traditions of The Prophet\\". In Iraq In February 2006, more than 100 people were killed across Iraq, when violence between the two Muslim rival sects erupted. It has left over a hundred people dead and dozens of mosques and homes destroyed. In Pakistan In Pakistan sectarianism exhibited its first organized nature in early 1980 when two rival organizations were established: Tehrik-e-Jafaria (TFJ) (Organization of the Jafri (Shia) Law) represented Shia communities, and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) (Guardian of the Companions of the Prophet) representing Sunnis. The first major incident of this sectarian violence was killing of the Arif Hussain Hussaini, founding leader of TFJ in 1986. In retaliation Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, founder of the (SSP) was murdered. Since then internecine bloody vendetta has ensued. The focus of this violence has been Kurram, Hangu, Dera Ismail Khan, Bahawalpur, Jhang, Quetta,Gigit- Baltistan and Karachi. The transformation of the sectarian conflict to a violent civil war in Pakistan coincided with the establishment of the Islamic republic in Iran and promotion of the Sunni religion and its incorporation in the state institutions by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, regime in Pakistan. The Iranian Revolution was led by Shia clerics, and it influenced Shia communities all over the world. In Pakistan Tehrik-e-Jafaria was established with the demands of enforcing the Sharia Law. This demand was viewed as detrimental by the Sunni religious leaders. In response SSP was established by the Sunni extremist clerics. Many of these clerics had a background in the sectarian strife against the Ahmadis (a heterodox sect considered non-Muslim by majority of the Muslims) In Somalia Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a is a Somali paramilitary group consisting of Sufis and moderates opposed to the radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab. They are fighting in order to prevent Wahhabism from being imposed on Somalia and to protect the country's Sunni-Sufi traditions and generally moderate religious views. In Syria The Syrian civil war gradually shifted towards a more sectarian nature. Pro-Assad militant groups are largely Shia, while anti-Assad militant groups are non-secular, fundamentalist Sunni. In Yemen In Yemen, there have been many clashes between Salafis and Shia Houthis.Salafi- Houthi clashes in Yemen kill 14 retrieved 6 February 2012 According to The Washington Post, \\"In today‚Äôs Middle East, activated sectarianism affects the political cost of alliances, making them easier between co-religionists. That helps explain why Sunni-majority states are lining up against Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah over Yemen.\\" See also * List of countries by discrimination and violence against minorities * Social cohesion * Hooliganism Examples * La Violencia in Colombia * Communalism (South Asia) * Cypriot intercommunal violence * Religious violence in India * 2005 civil unrest in France * 2005 Cronulla riots * 2006 Brussels riots * 2009 Boko Haram Uprising * 2009 Gojra riots * Rohingya conflict  References  Category:Religion and violence Category:Sectarianism ","title":"Sectarian violence"},{"id":"648563","text":"START II (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was a bilateral treaty between the United States of America and Russia on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed by United States President George H. W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 3 January 1993, banning the use of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Hence, it is often cited as the De-MIRV-ing Agreement. Despite negotiations, it never entered into effect. It was ratified by the U.S. Senate on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87‚Äì4. Russia ratified START II on 14 April 2000, but on 14 June 2002, withdrew from the treaty in response to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. Instead, SORT came into effect, reducing the strategic warheads count per country to 1,700‚Äì2,200. Impact of MIRV MIRVed land-based ICBMs are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. A MIRVed missile is able to carry 3-12 warheads and deliver them to separate targets. Thereby, if it is used in a first strike, it possibly destroys many of the enemy's missile sites. Hypothetically, if one were to assume that each side had 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and further that each side had a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo, then the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads and keeping the remaining 60 missiles in reserve. Thus the destruction capability is greatly multiplied by MIRV, when the number of enemy silos does not significantly increase. Both Soviet R-36M and the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles were capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs (the latter not currently operational). Negotiations The historic agreement started on 17 June 1992 with the signing of a 'Joint Understanding' by the presidents. The official signing of the treaty by the presidents took place on 3 January 1993. It was ratified by the U.S. Senate on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87‚Äì4. However, Russian ratification was stalled in the Duma for many years. It was postponed a number of times to protest American military actions in Iraq and Kosovo, as well as to oppose the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe. As the years passed, the treaty became less relevant and both sides started to lose interest in it. For the Americans, the main issue became the ABM Treaty, which forbade the deployment of a nationwide missile defense system. The United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty in June 2002, a move which Russia fiercely opposed. START II did not enter into force. On 14 April 2000 the Duma did finally ratify the treaty, in a largely symbolic move since the ratification was made contingent on preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) and thereby preserving the long-standing principle of mutually assured destruction (MAD). To be specific, Russian ratification was made contingent on the U.S. Senate ratifying a September 1997 addendum to START II which included agreed statements on demarcation of strategic versus tactical missile defences. Neither of these occurred because of U.S. Senate opposition, where a faction objected to any action supportive of the existing ABM Treaty. SORT replacing START II However, in 2001, President George W. Bush set a plan in motion to reduce the country's missile forces from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200. Thus the START II treaty was officially bypassed by the SORT treaty, agreed to by Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin at their summit meeting in November 2001, and signed at Moscow Summit on 24 May 2002. Both sides agreed to reduce operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700 from 2,200 by 2012. On 13 June 2002, the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty, and on the following day Russia announced that it would no longer consider itself to be bound by START II provisions. Both countries continued to pursue their objectives: Russia to this day retains 54 MIRV-capable RS-20/R-36M (SS-18 Satan) with 10 warheads each, 40 MIRV-capable RS-18/UR-100N (SS-19 Stiletto) with 6 warheads each and 24 MIRV-capable RS-24 Yars with 3 warheads each.\\"Chapter Five: Russia and Eurasia\\", The Military Balance 114, Nr. 1 (1. Januar 2014): 180f. The United States developed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system to protect from small-scale ICBM attack. In October 2002 United States began unilateral withdrawal of MIRV (including complete deactivation of Peacekeeper missiles) and completed it by 19 September 2005. The Minuteman III is, as of 2011, the only United States land- based operational ICBM. It can potentially carry up to only 3 RVs.

The seals are typically silver-grey or white in color, with black spots that vary in size covering most of the body. Hooded seal pups are known as \\"blue-backs\\" because their coats are blue-grey on the back with whitish bellies, though this coat is shed after 14 months of age when the pups molt. Naming The generic name Cystophora means \\"bladder- bearer\\" in Greek, from the species' unusual sexual ornament ‚Äì a peculiar inflatable bladder septum on the head of the adult male. This bladder hangs between the eyes and down over the upper lip in the deflated state. In addition, the hooded seal can inflate a large balloon-like sac from one of its nostrils. This is done by shutting one nostril valve and inflating a membrane, which then protrudes from the other nostril.Hooded Seal (Cystophora cristata), a Weird Animal . Drawfluffy.com.

Sexual dimorphism is obvious from birth and females are much smaller: long and weighing .Hooded seal images . arkive.org The Color is silvery; the body is scattered with dark, irregular marks. The head is darker than the rest of the body, and without marks. Distribution and habitat Hooded seals live primarily on drifting pack ice and in deep water in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic. Although some drift away to warmer regions during the year, their best survival rate is in colder climates. They can be found on four distinct areas with pack ice: near Jan Mayen Island (northeast of Iceland); off Labrador and northeastern Newfoundland; the Gulf of St. Lawrence; and the Davis Strait (off midwestern Greenland). Males appear to be localized around areas of complex seabed, such as Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, and the Flemish cap, while females concentrate their habitat efforts primarily on shelf areas, such as the Labrador Shelf. Hooded seals are known to be a highly migratory species that often wander long distances, as far west as Alaska and as far south as the Canary Islands and Guadeloupe. Prior to the mid 1990s, hooded seal sightings in Maine and the east Atlantic were rare, but began increasing in the mid 1990s. From January 1997 to December 1999, a total of 84 recorded sightings of hooded seals occurred in the Gulf of Maine, one in France and one in Portugal. From 1996 to 2006, five strandings and sightings were noted near the Spanish coasts in the Mediterranean Sea. There is no scientific explanation for the increase in sightings and range of the hooded seal. Diet The diet of the hooded seal is composed primarily of various amphipods (crustaceans), euphausiids (krill), and fish, including Atlantic Argentine, capelin, Greenland halibut, cod, herring, and redfish. They also are known to eat squid, sea stars, and mussels. Relative to the other species, hooded seals consume 3 times the proportion of redfish; percentages of capelin were similar in relation to closely related species. Capelin is considered a more common choice of sustenance during the winter season. Their diet is considered to be rich in lipids and fatty acids. Behavior Hooded seals tend to feed in relatively deep waters ranging from , and dive from 5 to 25 minute durations. However, some dives can go deeper than and as long, or longer, than 52 minutes. Diving is rather continuous, with approximately 90% of their time spent submerged during the day and night, although dives during the day are generally deeper and longer. Dives during the winter are also deeper and longer than those in the summer. It is known that the hooded seal is generally a solitary species, except during breeding and molting seasons. During these two periods, they tend to fast as well. The seals mass annually near the Denmark strait around July, at the time of their molting periods, to mate. Hooded seals are a relatively unsocial species compared to other seals, and they are typically more aggressive and territorial. They demonstrate aggression by inflating the \\"hood\\" (which is explained in the \\"Nasal Cavity\\" section below). They frequently migrate and remain alone for most of the year, except during mating season. Nasal cavity The hooded seal is known for its uniquely elastic nasal cavity located at the top of its head, also known as the hood. Only males possess this display-worthy nasal sac, which they begin to develop around the age of four. The hood begins to inflate as the seal makes its initial breath prior to going underwater. It then begins to repetitively deflate and inflate as the seal is swimming. The purpose of this happening is for acoustic signaling, meaning that it occurs when the seal feels threatened and attempts to ward off hostile species when competing for resources such as food and shelter. It also serves to communicate their health and superior status to both other males and females they are attempting to attract. In sexually mature males, a pinkish balloon-like nasal membrane comes out of the left nostril to further aid it in attracting a mate. This membrane, when shaken, is able to produce various sounds and calls depending on whether the seal is underwater or on land. Most of these acoustic signals are used in acoustic situation (about 79%), while about 12% of the signals are used for sexual purposes. Breeding and life cycle There are four major breeding areas for the hooded seal: the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the \\"Front\\" east of Newfoundland; Davis Strait (between Greenland and northern Canada); and the West Ice near Jan Mayen. Male hooded seals are known to have several mates in a single mating season, following the hypothesis that they are polygynous. While some males will defend and mate with just one female for long periods of time, others will be more mobile and tend to mate with multiple females for shorter periods of time, generating maximum offspring within the population. Most males reach sexual maturity by 5 years of age.Miller, Edward H., Ian L. Jones, and Garry B. Stenson. \\"Baculum and testes of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata): growth and size-scaling and their relationships to sexual selection.\\" Canadian Journal of zoology 77.3 (1999): 470-479. Throughout all areas, the hooded seals whelp in late March and early April and molt from June to August. The four recognized herds are generally sorted into two distinct populations: a Northeast (NE) Atlantic population and a Northwest (NW) Atlantic population. It is estimated that 90% of the total NW population give birth on the \\"Front\\". The NE herd whelping (giving birth) around Jan Mayen generally disperse into the sea after they breed in March. From April through June, after the breeding season, this species travels long distances to feed and then eventually gather together once again. Although some individuals return to the same area of ice in July to undergo moulting, the majority of the herd molt further North. After molting, the species disperses widely again to feed in the late summer and autumn before returning to the breeding areas again in late winter. Offspring thumb Pups are about long at birth and weigh about . They are born on the ice from mid-March to early April with a well-developed blubber layer and having shed their pre-natal coat. They are born with a slate blue-grey coat (giving them the name \\"blueback\\"), with a pale cream color on the belly, which they will molt after about 14 months. Nursing of the pup lasts for an average of only 4 days, the shortest lactation period of any mammal, during which the pup doubles in size, gaining around /day. This is possible because the milk that they drink has a fat content of 60%. The female pup will mature between ages 3 and 6, whereas the male pup will mature between ages 5 and 7. Early development Researchers find that due to a pup's differing needs in regards to sustaining work and foraging while under water compared to adults, the skeletal and cardiac muscles develop differently. Studies show that cardiac blood flow provides sufficient O2 to sustain lipolytic pathways during dives, remedying their hypoxic challenge. Cardiac tissue is found to be more developed than skeletal muscles at birth and during the weaning period, although neither tissue is fully developed by the end of the weaning period. Pups are born with fully developed hemoglobin stores (found in blood), but their myoglobin levels (found in skeletal tissue) are only 25‚Äì30% of adult levels. These observations conclude that pup muscles are less able to sustain both aerobic ATP and anaerobic ATP production during dives than adults are. This is due to the large stores of oxygen, either bound to hemoglobin or myoglobin, which the seals rely on to dive for extended periods of time. This could be a potential explanation for pups‚Äô short weaning period as diving is essential to their living and survival. Lifespan The hooded seal can live to about age 30 to 35. Threats and conservation practices Prior to the 1940s, adult hooded seals were primarily hunted for their leather and oil deposits. More recently, the main threats are hunting, including subsistence hunting, and bycatch. Seal strandings are not considered a large threat to Hooded Seal populations but are highly researched. Seal pups are hunted for their blue and black pelts and many mothers are killed in the process, attempting to protect their young. Hunting primarily occurs in areas of Greenland, Canada, Russia, and Norway. Overall, northwest Atlantic Hooded Seal populations are stable or increasing whereas the northeast Atlantic populations have declined by 85‚Äì90% within the last 60 years. It was believed by the scientific community that sonar was leading to mass stranding of Hooded Seals. After multiple sonar tests on captive seals, ranging from 1 to 7 kHz, it became evident that it had little effect on the subjects. The first test on each subject yielded differing results, ranging from reduced diving activity and rapid exploratory swimming. A difference was only noted for all subjects on their initial exposure. Conservation practices, brought about by international cooperation and the formation of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) led to Hooded Seal population increases. It is now required to hold a license to hunt Hooded Seals in international waters and each license is set a quota. Total allowable catch of hooded seals are set at 10,000 annually. The Hooded Seal is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. File:FMIB 34394 Hood Seals.jpegMother with pup.

It consisted of conservative former Whigs, largely from the Southern United States, who wanted to avoid secession over the slavery issue and refused to join either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. The Constitutional Union Party campaigned on a simple platform \\"to recognize no political principle other than the Constitution of the country, the Union of the states, and the Enforcement of the Laws\\". The Whig Party had collapsed in the 1850s due to a series of sectional crises over slavery. Though some former Whigs joined the Democratic Party or the new, anti-slavery Republican Party, others joined the nativist American Party. The American Party entered a period of rapid decline following the 1856 elections, and in the lead-up to the 1860 elections John J. Crittenden and other former Whigs founded the Constitutional Union Party. The 1860 Constitutional Union Convention met in May 1860, nominating John Bell of Tennessee for president and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president. Party leaders hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives by denying any one candidate a majority in the Electoral College. The 1860 election essentially consisted of two campaigns, as Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln competed with Northern Democratic candidate Stephen A. Douglas in the North, and Bell competed with Southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge in the South. Ultimately, Lincoln won the election by winning nearly every Northern electoral vote. Bell took 12.6% of the nationwide popular vote, carried three states in the Upper South, and finished with the second highest vote total in each remaining slave state that held a popular vote. After the election, Crittenden and other Constitutional Unionists unsuccessfully sought to prevent a civil war with the Crittenden Compromise and the Peace Conference of 1861. Bell declared his support for the Confederacy following the Battle of Fort Sumter, but many other Constitutional Unionists remained loyal to the Union throughout the American Civil War.  Background  1856 presidential election. Shades of yellow indicate counties that voted for American Party candidate Millard Fillmore. Many Fillmore supporters would later join the Constitutional Union Party. The Constitutional Union Party had its roots in the Whig Party and the sectional crises of the 1850s. The Compromise of 1850 shook up partisan alignments in South, with elections being contested by unionists and extremist \\"Fire-Eaters\\" rather than Whigs and Democrats. The victory of pro-compromise Southern politicians in these elections, along with President Millard Fillmore's attempts at diligently enforcing the Fugitive Slave Clause, temporarily quieted Southern calls for secession. The debate over the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act again polarized legislators sectional lines, with Southern Whigs providing critical votes in the House as a narrow majority of Northern Democrats voted against it.Holt (2010), pp. 78-89 A new, anti-slavery party known as the Republican Party was formed in May 1854.McPherson (1988), pp. 126. Republican leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, generally did not call for the abolition of slavery, but instead called for Congress to prevent the extension of slavery into the territories.McPherson (1988), p. 129. By 1855, Republicans had replaced the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democrats in most Northern states. The nativist American Party displaced the Whigs in the remaining states; though some Democrats joined the American Party, in many Southern states the American Party consisted almost entirely of former Whigs.McPherson (1988), pp. 140‚Äì141. The 1856 American National Convention nominated former President Fillmore for president in the 1856 presidential election; Fillmore also received the presidential nomination at the sparsely attended 1856 Whig National Convention.Holt (2010), pp. 91-94, 99, 106-109 Many supporters of the American Party continued to identify primarily as Whigs,Baggett (2004), pp. 32‚Äì33 and Fillmore minimized the issue of nativism, instead attempting to use his campaign as a platform for unionism and a revival of the Whig Party.Gara (1991), pp. 175‚Äì176. He finished in second in several states in the South and carried just a single state in the 1856 election, confirming that the Republican Party, rather than the American Party, would replace the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democrats.Holt (2010), pp. 109-110 The American Party collapsed after the 1856 elections, and many Southern officeholders who refused to join the Democratic Party organized themselves into the Opposition Party.Parks (1950), p. 346  Formation  Senator John J. Crittenden founded the party Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, Henry Clay's successor in border-state Whiggery, led a group of conservative, unionist congressmen in forming the Constitutional Union Party.Green (2007), pp. 232‚Äì233 At Crittenden's behest, fifty former and current members of Congress met in Washington, D.C. in December 1859, where they agreed to form a new party dedicated to preserving the union and avoiding debates over slavery.Haynes (2014), pp. 143‚Äì144 The new party received the blessing of the respective national committees of the Whig Party and the American Party,Baggett (2004), p. 33 and was officially formed on February 12, 1860.Green (2007), p. 231 Among the members of the new party's executive committee were Crittenden, former Democratic Senator William Cabell Rives of Virginia, 1852 Whig vice presidential nominee William Alexander Graham of North Carolina, former Congressman John P. Kennedy of Maryland, and newspaper editor William Gannaway Brownlow of Tennessee. In the North, the party drew support from conservative former Whigs like Edward Everett and Robert Charles Winthrop.Wilentz (2006), p. 758 Many of these Northerners, including Everett, were followers of Daniel Webster, a Whig senator from Massachusetts who had died in 1852.Egerton (2010), p. 88 Party leaders did not expect to win the election outright, but instead sought to win states in the Upper South and the Lower North. They were particularly focused on Maryland, the lone state won by Fillmore in 1856, as well as Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.Egerton (2010), pp. 89‚Äì90 Constitutional Unionists hoped to deny an electoral vote majority to any one candidate, thereby forcing a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Party leaders hoped that, in such a contingent election, the House would reject the other eligible candidates as too extreme and instead elect the Constitutional Union nominee.Sheppard (2014), pp. 515‚Äì517  National convention  Presidential nominee John Bell of Tennessee The Constitutional Union national convention convened on May 9, 1860. Delegates came from 23 of the 33 states,Egerton (2010), pp. 91‚Äì92 though the vast majority of delegates came from the Upper South.Green (2007), pp. 233‚Äì234 As a large proportion of the delegates were over the age of sixty, some political opponents derided the Constitutional Unionists as the \\"Old Gentleman's Party.\\" The party adopted a simple platform, stating that they would \\"recognize no political principle other than the Constitution...the Union...and the Enforcement of the Laws.\\"McPherson (1988), pp. 221‚Äì223 The party also established the National Central Executive Union Committee to wage the party's election campaign; Congressman Alexander Boteler of Virginia was selected to head the committee.Green (2007), p. 238 Though the septuagenarian Crittenden was the acknowledged party leader, he declined to seek the presidential nomination due to his age. The two major contenders for the presidential nomination were former Senator John Bell of Tennessee and Governor Sam Houston of Texas. During his long career in the Whig Party, Bell had established a reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, opposing both the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. Houston had served in two wars and had compiled a long political record as a leading member of the Democratic Party, and like Bell he had opposed the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. However, his status a former protege of Andrew Jackson alienated many of the delegates, and Bell's backers argued that Houston would have little appeal in the North.Egerton (2010), pp. 94‚Äì95 Aside from Bell and Houston, other potential candidates for the Constitutional Union presidential nomination included Everett, 1852 Whig nominee Winfield Scott, and Edward Bates of Missouri, who ultimately chose to support the Republican Party.Egerton (2010), pp. 91‚Äì92, 96 On the first presidential ballot, Bell won 68 1/2 votes compared to Houston's 57, with the remainder of the delegates voting for Crittenden, Everett, and various favorite son candidates. Bell picked up support from dozens of delegates on the second ballot, thereby clinching the nomination.Egerton (2010), p. 96 Houston refused to endorse Bell and ultimately declined to back any candidate in the 1860 election.Haley (2002), pp. 372‚Äì374 Seeking to provide sectional balance to the ticket, the convention selected Everett as the party's vice presidential nominee by acclamation.Green (2007), pp. 234‚Äì236 Everett reluctantly accepted the vice presidential nomination, as he felt that he had had a more accomplished career than Bell.Egerton (2010), pp. 96‚Äì97 With the nomination of two former Whigs, many regarded the Constitutional Union Party as a continuation of the Whig Party; one Southern newspaper called the new party the \\"ghost of the old Whig Party.\\"Egerton (2010), pp. 99‚Äì100  1860 presidential election  Electoral votes in the 1860 presidential election A split in the Democratic Party led to the nomination of two separate Democratic presidential candidates; Senator Stephen A. Douglas had the support of most Northern Democrats, while Vice President John C. Breckinridge garnered the backing of most Southern Democrats. Meanwhile, seeking to rally support in the Deep South, a group of Constitutional Unionists meeting in Alabama issued a platform holding that Congress and territorial legislatures could not prevent individuals from bringing slaves into the territories. This platform, though not adopted by the national party, badly damaged the standing of Constitutional Unionists in the North.Egerton (2010), pp. 100‚Äì101 Bell's ownership of slaves further alienated Northerners, and his and Everett's status as former Whigs limited the party's ability to compete for the support of Northern Democrats.Egerton (2010), p. 101 Thus, the 1860 presidential election essentially consisted of two separate campaigns. In the North, Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln faced Douglas, and in the South, the Constitutional Union ticket competed against Breckinridge. Adhering to precedent, Bell remained at his home during the campaign, but Breckinridge and other party leaders gave numerous speeches. The party campaigned on the slogan, \\"the Union as it is, the Constitution as it is.\\"Sheppard (2014), p. 505 The party's official lack of a stance on slavery positioned it between the Lincoln's Republican Party, who campaigned on a platform against extending slavery to any new states or territories, and Breckinridge's Southern Democrats, who favored allowing slavery in all territories.Green (2007), pp. 237‚Äì238 Historian Frank A. Towers writes that, \\"notwithstanding the nuances of local issues in selecting a president, voters could either endorse the compromise vision of the Union by choosing Douglas or Bell, or reject it by opting for Lincoln or Breckinridge.\\"Towers (2011), p. 121 Southern Democrats attacked the Constitutional Union platform, arguing that the issue of slavery could not be ignored in the campaign. Constitutional Unionists responded by attacking Breckinridge (who publicly disavowed disunion) as a secessionist who had fallen under the influence of Fire-Eaters like William Lowndes Yancey.Green (2007), pp. 238‚Äì240 The party also attacked Lincoln as an inexperienced, sectional candidate whose election threatened to provoke the secession of the South.Green (2007), p. 243 1860 presidential election. Recognizing Lincoln's likelihood of winning the election, some opponents of the Republican Party discussed the possibility of Bell, Breckinridge, and Douglas dropping out in favor of a new candidate, but Douglas and possibly Bell objected to this scheme.Green (2007), p. 244 In August, August Belmont, the chairman of Douglas's campaign, proposed an \\"entente cordiale\\" with the intent of denying Lincoln an electoral vote majority. After much negotiation, Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge agreed to form a single fusion ticket in the state of New York. In the event of a fusion victory in the state, Douglas would receive eighteen electoral votes, Bell would receive ten electoral votes, and Breckinridge would receive seven electoral votes.Sheppard (2014), pp. 511‚Äì513 Similar fusion tickets were established in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.Egerton (2010), p. 192 Nationwide, Lincoln took 39.8% of the popular vote, while Douglas won 29.5% of the popular vote, Breckenridge won 18.1%, and Bell won 12.6%. Lincoln carried all but one Northern state, winning a majority of the electoral vote with 180 votes to 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas. Lincoln won every county in New England and most of the remaining counties in the North, but he won just two of the 996 Southern counties.Paludan (1993), p. 5 Lincoln won New York by a margin of 7.4 points; had he lost the state to the Fusion ticket, he would not have won a majority of the electoral vote and a contingent election would have been held in the House of Representatives.Green (2007), p. 250 The vast majority of Bell's support came from Southern voters, though he did win three percent of the vote in the North. Bell won a plurality of the vote in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, and finished within five points of Breckinridge or Douglas in North Carolina, Maryland, Missouri, and Louisiana.Green (2007), p. 251 Bell finished a distant second to Breckinridge in all of the remaining slave states except South Carolina, which did not hold a popular vote for president. In addition to winning the presidency, the Republican Party made moderate gains in both the U.S. Senate and House in the 1860 elections, though Republicans failed to win a majority of seats in either.White (2009), pp. 350‚Äì351. However, after southern Democrats withdrew to join the Confederacy, the party gained control of both chambers prior to the start of the 37th Congress. Democrats would have the second-largest number of members in both chambers, although many members identified as unionists rather than Democrats or Republicans.  Secession  During the American Civil War, some states from the Constitutional Union base in the Upper South seceded, but Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri all remained in the Union Following Lincoln's victory, several states in the Deep South seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, but the Upper South initially remained in the Union.White (2009), pp. 361‚Äì369. Although some supporters of Breckinridge opposed secession and some supporters of Bell supported it, the secession movement was generally led by those who had voted for Breckindrige in the 1860 election, and efforts to avert secession in the South were generally led by those had voted for Bell.Towers (2011), pp. 121‚Äì122 The Senate created the Committee of Thirteen, consisting of prominent senators such as Crittenden, Douglas, Democrat Robert Toombs of Georgia, and Republican Benjamin Wade of Ohio.Egerton (2010), p. 288 Working closely with Douglas, Crittenden assumed leadership of the Committee of Thirteen even though he was not officially selected as the committee's leader.Egerton (2010), pp. 294‚Äì295 Crittenden proposed a package of six constitutional amendments, known as the Crittenden Compromise, that would forbid Congress from abolishing slavery in any state, protect slavery in federal territories south of the 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ parallel, and prohibit it in territories north of that latitude.White (2009), pp. 351‚Äì354. Crittenden's compromise proved unacceptable to both Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats, and it failed to win approval from the Committee of Thirteen.Egerton (2010), pp. 297‚Äì298 In another attempt to avert secession, leading politicians in the Lower North and Upper South organized the Peace Conference of 1861.Egerton (2010), pp. 307‚Äì308 The convention proposed a package of seven constitutional amendments that were largely similar to the Crittenden Compromise.Egerton (2010), pp. 311‚Äì313 On the last day of the 36th United States Congress, both the Crittenden Compromise and the separate plan proposed at the Peace Convention were rejected in the House and the Senate.Egerton (2010), p. 315 The Civil War began with the Confederate attack of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861.White (2009), pp. 406‚Äì407. After Lincoln called up volunteers in response to the Battle of Fort Sumter, Bell declared his support for the Confederacy. Bell's decision helped convince many other Constitutional Unionists and Southern moderates to support the Confederacy during the Civil War.McPherson (1988), pp. 277‚Äì278 Other party leaders, including Crittenden and Everett, remained loyal to the Union. Aftermath Constitutional Unionists were influential in the Wheeling Convention, which led to the creation of the Union loyalist state of West Virginia, as well as in the declaration of the Kentucky General Assembly for the Union and winning Congressional elections in Kentucky and Maryland in June. Many border state Constitutional Unionists, including John Marshall Harlan, joined unionist parties that sprung up during the war. In Missouri, many of the party joined the new Unconditional Union Party headed by Francis P. Blair, Jr. and remained active in that state's efforts to remain in the Union by overthrowing the elected government of Claiborne Jackson. Everett supported the Union and in 1863 gave a speech at Gettysburg before Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address. During Reconstruction, former Whigs and Constitutional Unionists constituted a majority of the scalawags (white members of the Republican Party) in almost every state in the South, joining the Republican Party at a higher rate than pre-war Democrats. Some of these scalawags continued to identify primarily as Whigs as late as the 1890s.Baggett (2004), pp. 34‚Äì37  See also  * National Union Party (United States) * 1860 United States presidential election * Unionist Party (United States)  Notes   References  Works cited   *  External links  * Party Platform of 1860 * OurCampaigns overview of Constitutional Union Convention 1860 Category:American nationalist parties Category:Political parties established in 1860 Category:American Civil War political groups Category:Defunct conservative parties in the United States Category:Defunct nationalist parties in the United States Category:1860 establishments in the United States Category:1865 disestablishments in the United States Category:Unionist Party (United States) Category:Political parties disestablished in 1865 Category:Politics of the Southern United States ","title":"Constitutional Union Party (United States)"},{"id":"648572","text":"Paul Blackburn (November 24, 1926 ‚Äì September 13, 1971) was an American poet. He influenced contemporary literature through his poetry, translations and the encouragement and support he offered to fellow poets.M.L. Rosenthal, preface to The Collected Poems of Paul Blackburn ; Edith Jarolim, introduction to The Collected Poems of Paul Blackburn ; http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/blackburn/blackburn_rothenberg_on_PB.html Biography Blackburn was born in St. Albans, Vermont. His parents, William Gordon Blackburn and Frances Frost (also a poet, novelist and author of children's books), separated when Blackburn was three and a half. Thereafter, he was cared for primarily by his maternal grandparents on their farm in St. Albans until he was fourteen, when his mother took him to New York City to live with her in Greenwich Village. He began writing poetry in his late teens under her encouragement.Clayton Eshelman,introduction to The Parallel Voyages, Shortly after enrolling in New York University in 1945, Blackburn joined the army hoping to be sent overseas. The war ended soon after however, and he spent the rest of his service as a laboratory technician in Colorado. In 1947 he returned to NYU, transferring in 1949 to the University of Wisconsin, and graduating in 1950. It was during these college years that Blackburn first became influenced by Ezra Pound, and began corresponding with him while at the University of Wisconsin. He hitchhiked to Washington, D.C. several times to visit him at St. Elizabeth's Hospital.Edith Jarolim, introduction to The Collected Poems of Paul Blackburn Through Pound, he came into contact with Robert Creeley, which led to links with Cid Corman, Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, Joel Oppenheimer and Jonathan Williams. Through Creeley came an ancillary involvement with the first two issues of Creeley's magazine, Black Mountain Review, which resulted in the occasional inclusion of Blackburn in the Black Mountain school of poets. The introduction to the Collected Poems states, \\"Blackburn always opposed the division of poets into schools and did not like the role of Black Mountain poet into which he was cast by Donald Allen's anthology The New American Poetry (1960).Donald M. Allen Editor, New American Poetry, 1945-1960 ( / 0-394-17225-6) He embraced all types of poetry, citing the value of 'all work, if you work 'em right.'\\" (E. Jarolim in The Collected Poems Of Paul Blackburn, 1985).Edith Jarolim, introduction to The Collected Poems of Paul Blackburn It was also Pound who pointed Blackburn in the direction of Proven√ßal poetry, and he studied the languages of Provence while at the University of Wisconsin. His work on Proven√ßal translations intensified following the 1953 publication of a slim selection of the poems from Divers Press, and the awarding the following year of a Fulbright Fellowship to study Proven√ßal language and literature in France. He continued translating Proven√ßal poetry for the rest of his life. It wasn‚Äôt until after his death that the work was fully published. Blackburn was also well known for his translations from Spanish of the medieval epic Poema del Mio Cid, of poetry by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Octavio Paz, and Pablo Picasso, and of the short stories of Julio Cort√°zar. He was for a time Cort√°zar's literary agent in the United States.Edith Jarolim, introduction to The Collected Poems of Paul Blackburn Blackburn played an important part in the poetry community, particularly in New York, where he helped fledgling poets develop. He provided logistical and emotional support for writers coming to the city and opportunities to read for both unknown and established writers in the various reading series with which he was involved. He organized readings that offered work from the Beats, the New York School, the Deep Image Poets, and the Black Mountain Poets. Clayton Eshleman has written, \\"Many, not just a few, but many poets alive today are beholden to him for a basic artistic kindness, for readings, yes, and for advice, but more humanly for a kind of comradeship that very few poets are willing to give.\\"\\"The Gull Wall\\" in Antiphonal Swing - Selected Prose 1962 / 1987 The readings Blackburn organized were the direct progenitors to the St. Mark's Poetry Project on Bowery. Additionally, Blackburn's commitment to recording readings that he organized and attended produced the most comprehensive oral history of the New York poetry scene between the late 1950s and 1970.Edith Jarolim, introduction to The Collected Poems of Paul Blackburn Until the mid-1960s Blackburn supported himself through various print-shop, editorial and translating jobs, including a short stint as poetry editor of The Nation. Some of his early jobs included working in-house on encyclopedias and writing free-lance reviews. In the mid-60s he had a show on WBAI with interviews of and readings by poets. He began receiving offers of teaching positions, and in 1965, 1966 and 1967 he directed workshops at the Aspen Writers' Conference. He was Poet-In-Residence at City College of New York in 1966-67. A Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 enabled him to return to Europe to work on his translations and poetry. Upon returning to the U.S. he supported himself through reading tours and teaching at the New School and the State University of New York at Cortland. Blackburn was married three times: to Winifred Grey McCarthy from 1954 to 1958; Sara Golden from 1963 to 1967; and Joan Diane Miller in 1968, with whom he had a son, Carlos T., in 1969. Paul Blackburn died of esophageal cancer in Cortland, New York, September 1971. Though Blackburn never set out to fully articulate his poetics, a good summation is the 1954 piece Statement. In his lifetime Blackburn published thirteen books of original poetry, as well as five major works of translation. Twelve other books were published posthumously.

At the 2011 census, the population was 2,995. The community includes the small settlements of Bancyfelin and Pwlltrap. It is bordered by the Carmarthenshire communities of, Meidrim, Newchurch and Merthyr, Llangynog, Laugharne Township, Llanddowror, Eglwyscummin, Llanboidy and Llangynin. History The Priory Church of St Mary Magdalene (Church in Wales) is a grade II* listed building and was founded ; a Cluniac priory of St Martin-des-Champs. It is considered to have the best surviving Norman stone carving in Carmarthenshire. The church was restored in 1853‚Äì5 and in 1883‚Äì4. The stained glass is . The Norman St Clears Castle was constructed in the 12th century. The castle mound can still be seen. The town, which was a Marcher Borough, grew around it. Below the castle, there was a port on the river T√¢f, which could take ships of up to 500 tons according to a plaque at the site. The castle held out against Owain Glynd≈µr. Nearby Trefenty House became the home of a branch of the Perrot family in the 16th century, and it was here that the amateur astronomer Sir William Lower and a neighbour, John Protheroe, set up one of Britain's first telescopes in 1609, which they used to study the craters of the Moon and Halley's Comet.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008 In 1842, one of the local toll gates was destroyed in the Rebecca Riots. The building of the South Wales Railway in the 1850s was responsible for the decline of many of the small ports along the Bristol Channel coast, and St Clears was no exception. The railway passed about two miles north of the castle, and new building at the north end of the High Street spread eastwards along Pentre Road, and then northwards to the station. Pentre Road is now the main commercial centre of St Clears and was formerly part of the A40 road until the bypass opened. The town's cattle market was important until its closure, but the town still has a large agricultural cooperative store. The town has also hosted an oil distribution centre and milk processing plant. Now smaller industrial units provide the main local employment. The photographer and film-maker Stanley Phillips lived in St Clears and documented life in the town and the surrounding area (active 1910‚Äì1961). His work appeared in the News Chronicle and the Daily and Sunday Mirrors, and in local newspapers. His films include The Last March of Mr. Jonah Rees at St. Clears (1930), which is in the collection of the National Library of Wales. He worked closely with Colonel William Buckley (whose work is also in the National Library of Wales) and E.V. Williams, both keen filmmakers. The permanent exhibition of Phillips' photographs and film at the Mezzanine Gallery in St. Clears includes photographs of the aviator Amy Johnson, World War I flying ace Wing Commander Ira Jones, and racing drivers Sir Malcolm Campbell and J. G. Parry-Thomas, who both attempted world land speed records at nearby Pendine Sands.

There are a variety of local shops including two prize-winning traditional butchers and two craft centres. There are several pubs. The surrounding countryside is mainly rolling grassland consisting of moderate- sized fields with well-kept hedges. The main agricultural enterprise is dairying, but sheep and beef are very important as well. The soils are deep and productive and will grow good crops of potatoes and cereals, and the climate allows fruit growing as well. Although most of the land is farmed commercially the area is a haven for wildlife. The highlight of the farming year is the St Clears YFC annual show which is held in May.

It is located on the north side of Gran Canaria island. Its population is (2013),Instituto Canario de Estad√≠stica, population and the area is . The town Santa Mar√≠a de Gu√≠a is situated in a valley from the coast, west of Las Palmas. The municipality stretches from the coast into the mountainous interior of the island. The GC-2 motorway passes north of the town.  Toponimy  Currently the municipality takes its name from its municipal capital, combined the invocation of its primitive hermitage founded in honor of Santa Mar√≠a de Gu√≠a at the end of the fifteenth century. During the aboriginal stage of the island, which ends in the year 1483, the population nucleus received the denomination of Agu√≠a, corresponding to the existing population in the same location of the historical center and surroundings, and also near the aboriginal from Agaldar, capital of a guanarteme chiefdom. This denomination was maintained until 1555, as indicated in the land and water distribution documents of Gran Canaria, granted after the European conquest of the island. After the European conquest, the historical nucleus was named as Villa de Gu√≠a, simplifying as Gu√≠a, and it remained that way throughout the colonial period, until the 19th century. Already in the 19th century begins to predominate the denomination of Guia de Gran Canaria, within a stream of administrative modernization and especially to differentiate it from other homonymous populations such as Gu√≠a de Isora, on the island of Tenerife. Already in the twentieth century and within the period of the Franco dictatorship, on December 28, 1962, the mayor of that time, Rafael Vel√°zquez Garc√≠a, proposed to change the official name to that of Santa Mar√≠a de Gu√≠a, incorporating the invocation of the Catholic religious temple existing in the municipality since the 16th century. The change was approved in full by the local corporation on April 26, 1963, subsequently obtaining the approval of the Island Council de Gran Canaria, which had been denied in the first instance, the change being to Santa Mar√≠a de Gu√≠a de Gran Canaria by agreement of the Council of Ministers of the Franco government on July 23, 1963. In 2008, the City Council promoted a debate from the municipal website for neighbors to express their opinion on whether or not to officially retake the name of Gu√≠a de Gran Canaria.  Geography  View of The Watchtower of Sta. M¬™ de Gu√≠a. Located in the north of Gran Canaria, the municipality has a triangular shape, which places its vertex towards the south, near the caldera of the Pinos de G√°ldar. To the east it borders the municipality of Moya defined by Barranco de Moya until its mouth. To the west, the division follows some channels, surrounds the Pico de La Atalaya or G√°ldar mountain, and continues to the coast, dividing the Pico de la Atalaya in two. The coastline is defined between Caleta de Arriba until the mouth of the Barranco de Moya. The coasts are rocky due to erosion, cliffs predominate, although with exceptions such as San Felipe beach, which in summer is covered with sand.  Climatology  The climatic conditions of Santa Mar√≠a de Gu√≠a derive from its northern position. Thus, there are three altitudinal steps, which are: * The coastal zone, which reaches up to 300 meters; * The medians between 300 and 600 meters; * The high zone, from 600 meters. As it enters the interior of the island the number of sunny days per year is less; It rains more and temperatures are generally lower. Population Heritage sites The caves of Valer√≥n, also called cenobio de Valer√≥n, is a property of cultural interest in the \\"archaeological site\\" category. It is the largest pre-Hispanic collective granary. Its size is representative of Gran Canaria agriculture, unique among the Canaries islands in that it was traditionally dominated by plantations, with much of these being grains, rather than by stock-breeding.Cenobio de Valeron, section \\"El yacimiento arqueologico\\". On arqueologiacanaria.com. The Quintana House is a sample of the ancient architecture of the municipality of Guia de Gran Canaria in the Canarian island of Gran Canaria, located in the Plaza Mayor de Gu√≠a and its buildings date from the 16th century. The Canarian balcony is of Mudejar style, in wood and coat of arms with the surnames Guanarteme and Quintana.

D. Fergusson (1909) The Scottish Colourists were a group of four painters, three from Edinburgh, whose Post-Impressionist work, though not universally recognized initially, came to have a formative influence on contemporary Scottish art and culture. They were Francis Cadell, John Duncan Fergusson, Leslie Hunter and Samuel Peploe. These four artists had much in common, hence the appellation ‚ÄòScottish Colourists‚Äô. The art historian Duncan Macmillan wrote > ‚ÄúIn the end the justification for continuing to treat them separately though > is their collective achievement and international reputation that they have > earned as four of the most gifted painters of their generation in Britain.‚Äù The expression ‚ÄòScottish Colourists‚Äô according to Macmillan may have first been used as early as 1915 in the Studio magazine. Its specific association in print, again according to Macmillan, seems to have been first used by T J Honeyman , the art critic and director of Glasgow Art Gallery, in his book Three Scottish Colourists published in 1950. Why he did not include Fergusson at this point is unclear, but Fergusson seems to have soon been accepted into this group of artists. The four artists did in fact exhibit together, for the first time in 1924 in Paris at an exhibition at the Galerie Barbazanges entitled ‚ÄòLes Peintres de l‚ÄôEcosse Moderne‚Äô (Bilcliffe) . The following year, they showed together at an exhibition in London at the Leicester Gallery. History The Scottish Colourists combined their training in France and the work of French Impressionists and Fauvists, such as Monet, Matisse and C√©zanne, with the painting traditions of Scotland. A forerunner of this movement was William McTaggart (1835-1910), a Scottish landscape painter who was influenced by Post-Impressionism. He is regarded as one of the great interpreters of the Scottish landscape and is often labelled the \\"Scottish Impressionist\\". Largely recognised as the leading figure of the group was Samuel Peploe. The other Scottish Colourists were Francis Cadell, John Duncan Fergusson and Leslie Hunter. They \\"absorbed and reworked the strong and vibrant colours of contemporary French painting into a distinctive Scottish idiom during the 1920s and 1930s\\". Francis Cadell, The Vase of Water, 1922 Their subject matter is often considered conservative compared to their French counterparts, since much of it consisted of island landscapes, Edinburgh interiors and fashionable models; their style was confident and vibrant. The Scottish Colourists were internationally known during their lifetimes but their work fell out of favour by World War II, until they were rediscovered in the 1980s and subsequently played an influential role in the development of Scottish art. Their work is featured in the Aberdeen Art Gallery in Aberdeen, Scotland; the J. D. Fergusson Gallery in Perth, Scotland; the University of Stirling, Paisley Museum and Art Galleries and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. Some of Leslie Hunter's paintings can be seen in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery. The Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery is said to house the largest collection of works by Peploe and McTaggart. From 18 October 2019 - 1 February 2020 Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal, hosted an exhibition of the Scottish Colourists largely based on works from the Fleming Collection.

It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-which are a large group of organic compounds occurring in groups of two or more. Phenanthrene occurs naturally and also is a man-made chemical. Commonly, humans are exposed to phenanthrene through inhalation of cigarette smoke but there are many routes of exposure. Evidence, proven through animal studies, shows that phenanthrene is a potential carcinogen . It appears as a colorless, crystal-like solid but can also look yellow. Phenanthrene is used to make dyes, plastics and pesticides, explosives and drugs. It has also been used to make bile acids, cholesterol and steroids. The compound with a phenanthrene skeleton and nitrogens at the 4 and 5 positions is known as phenanthroline. Chemistry Phenanthrene is nearly insoluble in water but is soluble in most low polarity organic solvents such as toluene, carbon tetrachloride, ether, chloroform, acetic acid and benzene. The Bardhan‚ÄìSengupta phenanthrene synthesis is a classic way to make phenanthrenes. :Bardhan‚ÄìSenguptam phenanthrene synthesis This process involves electrophilic aromatic substitution using a tethered cyclohexanol group using diphosphorus pentoxide, which closes the central ring onto an existing aromatic ring. Dehydrogenation using selenium converts the other rings into aromatic ones as well. The aromatization of six-membered rings by selenium is not clearly understood, but it does produce H2Se. Phenanthrene can also be obtained photochemically from certain diarylethenes. Reactions of phenanthrene typically occur at the 9 and 10 positions, including: * Organic oxidation to phenanthrenequinone with chromic acidOrganic Syntheses, Coll.

The town is the capital of the Jura bernois administrative district. History Aerial view (1950) Courtelary is first mentioned in 968 as Curtis Alerici in a list of the properties of Moutier- Grandval Abbey. In 1179, Pope Alexander III elevated the Abbot to a Canon and confirmed the Abbots title to Courtelary. In addition to Moutier-Granval Abbey, the Cathedral chapter of Saint-Imier owned properties in the village which were managed for them by the Lords of Fenis-Neuch√¢tel. However, while under the control of the Lords of Fenis-Neuch√¢tel, the valley became a bailiwick of the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The Prince-Bishop placed the valley under the Seigniory of Erguel. By the late 13th century, Seigniory was controlled by the town of Biel. Due to the rising popularity of the cult of St. Imerius, in the 10th or 11th century a small Church of St. Imerius was built in the village. The original building was expanded in 1372, 1642 and finally in 1773. During a restoration in 1933-36, several 11th century murals were discovered in the building. The Courtelary parish was first mentioned in the 13th century. In 1530, Biel began forcing the entire Erguel region to accept the Protestant Reformation. This interference in local affairs pushed the residents of the valley to create an alliance with the town of Solothurn. In 1604 with Solothurn's support, the appeals court moved from Biel to Courtelary which brought limited self-rule back to the valley. Two years later the seat of the Erguel Bailiwick moved to Courtelary's New Castle (which later became the town hall). During the Thirty Years' War, in 1639, the village was plundered and partially burned by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar's troops. In 1726, the Prince-Bishop of Basel, Johann Konrad von Reinach-Hirzbach, attempted to modernize and consolidate his extensive land holdings. He tried to sweep away the numerous local laws, customs and rights and replace them with a central government ruled according to the principles of enlightened absolutism. Riots and revolts against the new government broke out almost immediately in the Erguel valley and the region remained a center of anti-government activity. In 1733 a meeting at the Courtelary Castle exploded into a riot and the Prince- Bishop's bailiff, Beno√Æt-Aim√© Mestrezat, was forced to flee the city. In 1792 and 1793, heavily influenced by the French Revolution, the revolutionary National Assembly of Erguel was established in Courtelary. Revolutionaries flocked to the town and established a short-lived Republic of Erguel. In 1797 the French invaded the lands of the Bishop of Basel and established the Canton of Courtelary with Courtelary as the capital. The Canton was initially part of the Department of Mont-Terrible followed by the Department of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat, in 1815, the Erguel region became part of the Canton of Bern. Courtelary was the capital of the District of Erguel until 1831 when it became the capital of the District of Courtelary. Camille Bloch Chocolates in Courtelary Courtelary remained a rural and agricultural town until the early 20th Century. The farms on the valley floor produced grain for local use. In contrast, the surrounding mountain pastures were used by Anabaptist sharecroppers to raise dairy cattle and other livestock. They then produced butter and cheese which they exported. In 1874 the Biel-Les Convers-La Chaux- de-Fonds railroad was built through the town. The lower transportation costs from the railroad allowed a wood pulp factory to be built in Courtelary. In 1935, the Camille Bloch chocolate factory moved into the old wood pulp building. Other than the chocolate factory, manufacturing developed very slowly in Courtelary. A few precision machine and watch parts factories were built during the early 20th century, but during the 1970s these industries declined. In the following decades the industrial sector rebounded and in 2000 about 47% of the working population worked in industry.

It is the second largest town in the principal area and county of Powys and is in the historic county of Brecknockshire. The town has a high proportion of Welsh language-speakers. History The place-name Ystradgynlais, meaning 'vale of the river Cynlais' ‚Äì Cynlais may be a personal name, or derive from cyn ('chisel') and glais ('stream') ‚Äì is first recorded in 1372. In the 1600s there were only a couple of houses by the church and a pub (now the rectory). In 1801 there were only 993 residents in the town living in only 196 houses. The first documented written evidence of iron working in the area was at Ynyscedwyn and is of a deed of release dated 1729. By 1750 there were seven furnaces in south Wales, one of which was at Ynyscedwyn. The first written evidence of coal mining was at Wauclawdd in 1780. Most of the coal dug up was used in the blast furnaces of the ironworks. By 1790, the full extent of the mineral resources in the valley was better known and it was realised that to exploit these to the full, improved transport would be essential. The greatest increase in the population was between 1821 and 1841. This coincides with the coming of George Crane and the development of the Ynyscedwyn Ironworks. By 1870, the town's industrial development was in decline due to various economic factors, although coal mining carried on in the area with a few light industries. Culture Parc yr Orsedd, Ystradgynlais These remains were built in 1872 to house a planned steel mill. Although not completed, the site housed the Ynyscedwyn Tinplate Works Adelina Patti (1843‚Äì1919), opera singer Rowan Williams visiting the National Assembly for Wales (2012) Eve Myles, television actress Ystradgynlais hosted the 1954 National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh festival of literature, dance, and music. The century-old award-winning Ystradgynlais Public Band competed in the 2005 National Eisteddfod. Ystradgynlais's Parc-yr-Orsedd has a monument to the fallen heroes of both World Wars from Ystradgynlais, Abercrave, Cwmtwrch, Cwmgiedd, Glyntawe and Coelbren. Dan yr Ogof caves are a short journey from the town centre, passing Craig-y-Nos Castle and country park. The caves are reputed to have once been the hideout of folk figure Twm Si√¥n Cati. Henrhyd Falls are also nearby. Ystradgynlais is also home to the Miners Welfare Hall, known and promoted as 'The Welfare', which contains a cinema. It also has a number of public houses. In 2016 The Stephen Lewis Tristars Aquathlon in Ystradgynlais won the Welsh triathlon event of the Year 2016 Transport National Cycle Route 43 passes by the southern edge of the town on the line of the former Swansea Vale Railway which linked Swansea via the Neath and Brecon Railway at Coelbren with Brecon. Ystradgynlais railway station was operational from 1869 to 1923. The A4067 road linking West Cross, Swansea, with Sennybridge ran through the town until the 1970s, when it was diverted onto the bypass that follows the line of the former Swansea Canal. Sport The town is the home of Ystradgynlais F.C. and Ystradgynlais RFC. Ystradgynlais RFC was established in 1890 and has a fierce rivalry with Ystalyfera RFC and Abercrave RFC. Watchmaking In 1946, Smiths Industries Ltd, Ingersoll Ltd and Vickers Armstrong founded the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co. Ltd. producing watches on the Ynyscedwyn estate on the outskirts of Ystradgynlais. The factory was officially opened by Hugh Dalton on 15 March 1947. Vickers Armstrong sold their shares to the other two companies in 1948. The company became one of the largest producers of watches in Europe, producing up to 1.25 million watches a year until 1980 when it closed. Notable people The Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002‚Äì12, Rowan Williams, grew up in Ystradgynlais and Calvinistic Methodist minister Thomas Levi was also born in the town. Politician Caerwyn Roderick and prison reform campaigner Ben Gunn both grew up in the town. Ystradgynlais has produced a number of Wales international rugby players, including William Lewis Thomas, Huw David Richards, Anthony Buchanan, Steve Bayliss, and Kevin Hopkins. The town was the birthplace of Welsh international footballer Ronnie Rees (born 4 April 1944), who won 39 caps for Wales. The Polish painter Josef Herman (1911‚Äì2000), spent 11 years living and painting in Ystradgynlais. Artists who grew up in the town include opera singer Adelina Patti, composer Daniel Protheroe, novelist Menna Gallie, and actors Steve Meo and Eve Myles. John Howard Purnell, former president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, was originally from the town, as were physicians Tudor Thomas and Julian Hopkin, and academic Goronwy Daniel.

It is about south-west of Pwllheli and south-west of the county town of Caernarfon. The village takes its name from the river, Afon Soch, which reaches the sea in the village. Archaeology In the dry summer of 2018, aerial photography at Fach Farm, some 1100 metres north of the bridge over the Afon Soch, identified crop marks that were reported as a possible Roman fortlet.

It is known for its stork colony. History Hauert's fertilizer factory around 1960 Grossaffoltern is first mentioned in 1216 as Affoltron. The oldest evidence of humans in the Grossaffoltern area are neolithic objects at Vorimholz, an Early Bronze Age ax blade depot at Munimatte and Bronze Age items at Kosthofen. There are at least 38 Hallstatt era grave mounds scattered around the municipality. The area was also inhabited during the Roman era and the Early Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages it was owned by the House of Z√§hringen until that family died out, when it was inherited by the Kyburgs.

The fertile swathe of land stretching from Barmouth to Harlech was historically used as pasture. History Ardudwy features prominently in Welsh mythology.

It also boasts two public houses; Ty Mawr Hotel and The Victoria Inn. To the north of the village is the smaller village of Pensarn, situated at the estuary of the river Artro. This is the location of Llanbedr & Pensarn Yacht Club and the Christian Mountain Centre, a residential adventure activity centre. Railways Llanbedr railway station, formerly known as Talwrn Bach Halt, is a little out of the village itself and is served by the Cambrian Line. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward also covers the Community of Llanfair. The total ward population at the 2011 Census was 1,098. Twinning In 2008 Llanbedr was twinned with Huchenfeld, Germany, following many years of exchanges between schools, churches, musicians and community leaders, in remembrance of the ghastly occurrences in 1945 at Pforzheim and Huchenfeld during the Second World War.

The community had a population of 878 as of the 2011 census. The electoral ward had a larger population of 1,282 and includes the community of Pennal. The village was founded around the harbour and shipbuilding industry, but is now best known as a seaside resort with a high quality beach. The centre is on the river and seafront, around the original harbour, jetty and beach but it stretches back from the coast and up the steep hillside in the midst of typical Welsh coastal scenery of steep green hills and sheep farms. Penhelig (), with its own railway station, in the eastern part of the village. Aberdyfi, being less than from the West Midlands, is popular with tourists. A relatively large proportion of houses in the village are now holiday homes. The town is located within the Snowdonia National Park. In the 2011 census, 38.5% of the population of Aberdyfi ward identified themselves as Welsh (or combined). Name Bilingual welcome sign, using both the Welsh and anglicised spellings, on the approach to the village. The anglicised spelling for the village and community is Aberdovey. The Welsh Aberdyfi is now widely used locally and by the Gwynedd Council and the Welsh Government. Some entities continue to use the anglicisation e.g. in their name and/or address and some use the two spellings interchangeably. History Aberdyfi, 1860 Aberdyfi from across the river. Local tradition suggests that the Romans established a track into Aberdyfi as part of the military occupation of Wales around AD78. The strategic location in mid-Wales was the site of several conferences between north and south Wales princes in 540, 1140, and for the Council of Aberdyfi in 1216. The hill in the centre of Aberdyfi, Pen-y-Bryn, has been claimed to be the site of fortifications in the 1150s, which were soon destroyed. The site of Aberdyfi Castle however is usually said to be at the motte earthworks further up the river near Glandyfi. During the Spanish Armada of 1597, a Spanish ship, the Bear of Amsterdam missed her objective at Milford Haven and ended up having entered the Dyfi estuary. She was unable to leave for 10 days because of the wind and could not be boarded as no suitable boats were available. An attempt to burn her was frustrated by winds and when she did leave she ended up being captured by a waiting English fleet off the Cornish coast. In the 1700s, the village grew with the appearance of several of the inns still in current use (The Dovey Hotel, Britannia and Penhelig Arms). Copper was mined in the present Copperhill Street, and lead in Penhelig. Aberdyfi, showing the harbour Governance An electoral ward of the same name stretches inland along the A494 road and includes Pennal community. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,282. Port and railway In the 1800s, Aberdyfi was at its peak as a port. Major exports were slate and oak bark. Ship building was based in seven shipyards in Penhelig where 45 sailing ships were built between 1840 and 1880. The railway came to Aberdyfi in 1863 built by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway. The first train was ferried across the river, as the line to Dovey Junction and then Machynlleth was not completed until 1867. Due to public demand, this section had to use a long tunnel behind Aberdyfi, and further major earthworks and tunnels were needed along the bank of the river. This line, which became part of the Cambrian Railways, and later the Great Western Railway, is particularly scenic.Christiansen, Rex & Miller, R.W. The Cambrian Railways, Vol. 1 David & Charles (1967) A jetty was built in 1887, with railway lines connecting it with the wharf and the main line. The Aberdyfi & Waterford Steamship Company imported livestock from Ireland which were then taken further by the railway. Coal, limestone and timber were also imported. Crowds on shore at Aberdyfi watching the regatta, circa 1885 A view of Aberdyfi from Penhelyg Rock, circa 1885 Local coastal shipping links with Liverpool were strong, with many Aberdyfi men sailing on international voyages from Liverpool. The S.S. Dora was one of the last ships trading between Aberdyfi and Liverpool and was scuttled, with no loss of life, by a German submarine in 1917. The jetty and wharf continued in commercial use for coal until 1959. After prolonged negotiations, redevelopments from 1968‚Äì1971, including rebuilding the jetty, led to their present use mainly for recreational purposes. Some local fishing still occurs. The first ever Outward Bound centre was opened in Aberdyfi in 1941.Outward Bound International. . Retrieved 10 October 2014. Many of their activities involve the river, boats and jetty. Lifeboat The first Aberdyfi lifeboat was bought in 1837. Run by the RNLI since 1853, it has taken part in many rescues, sometimes with loss of life of crew members. The current lifeboat, an Atlantic 75, is housed in the boathouse by the jetty and is launched using a lifeboat tractor. Currently it is averaging about 25 emergency launches each year. Worship Chapels in Aberdyfi include the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel, the English Presbyterian chapel, the Wesleyan Methodist chapel, and the Welsh Independent congregational chapel. The (Anglican) Church in Wales is St Peter's. Transport Road access to Aberdyfi is by the A493, with Tywyn four miles to the north and Machynlleth 11 miles to the east. Aberdyfi is on the Cambrian Coast railway line. The village of Aberdyfi has two railway stations, Aberdovey and Penhelig. Trains on the Cambrian Line are operated by Transport for Wales. The local bus service is operated by Lloyds Coaches with services to Tywyn, where a connection can be made for Dolgellau, and to Machynlleth, where connections are available to Aberystwyth. A ferry used to operate across the River Dyfi to Ynyslas. The last ferryman was Ellis Williams. Recreation Popular recreational activities focus on the beach and watersports, such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, fishing, crabbing, sailing, and canoeing on the estuary.

It was founded in 1949 and helped develop the popularity of the GP14 dinghy class. It organises races for dinghies throughout the season on the estuary of the River Dyfi. The Aberdovey Golf Club, founded in 1892, is a famous 18 hole links course located near the railway station. It is world- renowned, having been described frequently and lyrically in the press by Bernard Darwin, the famed golf writer, who was a notable member of the club. In 1895, it was the location of the first Welsh Golfing Union Championship. Current members include Ian Woosnam and Peter Baker. Located by the Aberdovey Golf Club is Aberdyfi Football club boasting one of the best football pitches in Mid-Wales. The football team won the Welsh Amateur Cup Competition in 1934. The Aberdyfi Rowing Club rows in the Dyfi Estuary and Cardigan Bay and takes part in races all round the coast of Wales and internationally. They row 24‚Äô long Celtic longboats, with four rowers (each with one oar) and a cox. They have three of these traditional Welsh boats with fixed seats and use these for races in Wales. The Aberdovey Literary Institute, founded in 1882, is situated on the river front. The deeds of 1923 state it was established in perpetuity as \\"a non-sectarian, non-political place of recreation, education and social intercourse including ... reading rooms, writing rooms, library, billiard rooms, concert rooms ...\\" Neuadd Dyfi is a community hall, conference centre and theatre owned by the village for village activities. It caters for a range of local organisations and events. Cultural references The Bells of Aberdovey The bells of St Peter's Church can play The Bells of Aberdovey Aberdyfi is closely linked to the legend of the submerged lost kingdom of Cantre'r Gwaelod () beneath Cardigan Bay, and bells which, it is said, can be heard ringing beneath the water at the beach. The Bells of Aberdovey () is a well-known song referring to this legend. This song first appeared in the English opera Liberty Hall in 1785, written by Charles Dibdin, and is not thought to be a traditional folk-song as Welsh words were written by John Ceiriog Hughes, during the 19th century. The legend and the song have inspired local cultural projects involving bells. A new chime of bells was installed in September 1936 in the tower of St Peter's Church, which overlooks Aberdyfi harbour. The ten bells, tuned in the key of A flat, were specifically designed to allow the playing of The Bells of Aberdovey and are played from a mechanical carillon inside the church. A bell installed beneath the pier rings at high tide In 2010 an art installation was commissioned from sculptor Marcus Vergette as a homage to The Bells of Aberdovey. The work is a bronze time-and- tide bell suspended beneath Aberdyfi pier which is rung by the action of water at high tide. It was installed in July 2011 and is one of several such bells around the United Kingdom. Other Bugail Aberdyfi (the Shepherd of Aberdovey) is a poem written by John Ceiriog Hughes which has been set to music and recorded by several singers including Bryn Terfel. The children's novel, Silver on the Tree, by Susan Cooper, the final book of The Dark is Rising, is largely set around Aberdyfi, with many references to local landmarks. The novel, Megan's Game by Tony Drury, published in 2012, contains many references to Aberdyfi, surrounding areas and the legend of The Bells of Aberdovey.

In mathematics, the exponential integral Ei is a special function on the complex plane. It is defined as one particular definite integral of the ratio between an exponential function and its argument. Definitions For real non-zero values of x, the exponential integral Ei(x) is defined as : \\\\operatorname{Ei}(x)=-\\\\int_{-x}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{e^{-t}}t\\\\,dt=\\\\int_{-{\\\\infty}}^{x}\\\\frac{e^{t}}t\\\\,dt.\\\\, The Risch algorithm shows that Ei is not an elementary function. The definition above can be used for positive values of x, but the integral has to be understood in terms of the Cauchy principal value due to the singularity of the integrand at zero. For complex values of the argument, the definition becomes ambiguous due to branch points at 0 and \\\\infty.Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228 Instead of Ei, the following notation is used,Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, 5.1.1 :E_1(z) = \\\\int_z^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-t}}{t}\\\\, dt,\\\\qquad{\\\\rm Arg}(z)<\\\\pi (note that for positive values of x, we have -E_1(x) = \\\\operatorname{Ei}(-x)). In general, a branch cut is taken on the negative real axis and E1 can be defined by analytic continuation elsewhere on the complex plane. For positive values of the real part of z, this can be writtenAbramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, 5.1.4 with n = 1 :E_1(z) = \\\\int_1^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-tz}}{t}\\\\, dt = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{e^{-z/u}}{u}\\\\, du ,\\\\qquad \\\\Re(z) \\\\ge 0. The behaviour of E1 near the branch cut can be seen by the following relation:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, 5.1.7 :\\\\lim_{\\\\delta\\\\to0+} E_1(-x \\\\pm i\\\\delta) = -\\\\operatorname{Ei}(x) \\\\mp i\\\\pi,\\\\qquad x>0. Properties Several properties of the exponential integral below, in certain cases, allow one to avoid its explicit evaluation through the definition above. Convergent series For real or complex arguments off the negative real axis, E_1(z) can be expressed asAbramowitz and Stegun, p. 229, 5.1.11 :E_1(z) =-\\\\gamma-\\\\ln z-\\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(-z)^k}{k\\\\; k!} \\\\qquad (\\\\operatorname{Arg}(z) < \\\\pi) where \\\\gamma is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant. The sum converges for all complex z, and we take the usual value of the complex logarithm having a branch cut along the negative real axis. This formula can be used to compute E_1(x) with floating point operations for real x between 0 and 2.5. For x > 2.5, the result is inaccurate due to cancellation. A faster converging series was found by Ramanujan: :{\\\\rm Ei} (x) = \\\\gamma + \\\\ln x + \\\\exp{(x/2)} \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{ (-1)^{n-1} x^n} {n! \\\\, 2^{n-1}} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\\\rfloor} \\\\frac{1}{2k+1} These alternating series can also be used to give good asymptotic bounds for small x, e.g. : :1-\\\\frac{3 x}{4}\\\\le{\\\\rm Ei} (x) - \\\\gamma - \\\\ln x \\\\le 1-\\\\frac{3 x}{4}+\\\\frac{11 x^2}{36} for x\\\\ge 0. Asymptotic (divergent) series Relative error of the asymptotic approximation for different number ~N~ of terms in the truncated sum Unfortunately, the convergence of the series above is slow for arguments of larger modulus. For example, for x = 10 more than 40 terms are required to get an answer correct to three significant figures for E_1(z).Bleistein and Handelsman, p. 2 However, there is a divergent series approximation that can be obtained by integrating z e^z E_1(z) by parts:Bleistein and Handelsman, p. 3 : E_1(z)=\\\\frac{\\\\exp(-z)} z \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\\\frac{n!}{(-z)^n} which has error of order O(N!z^{-N}) and is valid for large values of \\\\operatorname{Re}(z). The relative error of the approximation above is plotted on the figure to the right for various values of N, the number of terms in the truncated sum (N=1 in red, N=5 in pink). Exponential and logarithmic behavior: bracketing Bracketing of E_1 by elementary functions From the two series suggested in previous subsections, it follows that E_1 behaves like a negative exponential for large values of the argument and like a logarithm for small values. For positive real values of the argument, E_1 can be bracketed by elementary functions as follows:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 229, 5.1.20 : \\\\frac 1 2 e^{-x}\\\\,\\\\ln!\\\\left( 1+\\\\frac 2 x \\\\right) < E_1(x) < e^{-x}\\\\,\\\\ln!\\\\left( 1+\\\\frac 1 x \\\\right) \\\\qquad x>0 The left-hand side of this inequality is shown in the graph to the left in blue; the central part E_1(x) is shown in black and the right-hand side is shown in red. Definition by Ein Both \\\\operatorname{Ei} and E_1 can be written more simply using the entire function \\\\operatorname{Ein}Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, see footnote 3. defined as : \\\\operatorname{Ein}(z) = \\\\int_0^z (1-e^{-t})\\\\frac{dt}{t} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^{k+1}z^k}{k\\\\; k!} (note that this is just the alternating series in the above definition of \\\\mathrm{E}_1). Then we have : E_1(z) \\\\,=\\\\, -\\\\gamma-\\\\ln z + {\\\\rm Ein}(z) \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{Arg}(z) < \\\\pi :\\\\operatorname{Ei}(x) \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\gamma+\\\\ln x - \\\\operatorname{Ein}(-x) \\\\qquad x>0 Relation with other functions Kummer's equation :z\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (b-z)\\\\frac{dw}{dz} - aw = 0 is usually solved by the confluent hypergeometric functions M(a,b,z) and U(a,b,z). But when a=0 and b=1, that is, :z\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (1-z)\\\\frac{dw}{dz} = 0 we have :M(0,1,z)=U(0,1,z)=1 for all z. A second solution is then given by E1(‚àíz). In fact, :E_1(-z)=-\\\\gamma-i\\\\pi+\\\\frac{\\\\partial[U(a,1,z)-M(a,1,z)]}{\\\\partial a},\\\\qquad 0<{\\\\rm Arg}(z)<2\\\\pi with the derivative evaluated at a=0. Another connexion with the confluent hypergeometric functions is that E1 is an exponential times the function U(1,1,z): :E_1(z)=e^{-z}U(1,1,z) The exponential integral is closely related to the logarithmic integral function li(x) by the formula : \\\\operatorname{li}(e^x) = \\\\operatorname{Ei}(x) for non-zero real values of x . The exponential integral may also be generalized to :E_n(x) = \\\\int_1^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^n}\\\\, dt, which can be written as a special case of the incomplete gamma function:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 230, 5.1.45 : E_n(x) =x^{n-1}\\\\Gamma(1-n,x). The generalized form is sometimes called the Misra functionAfter Misra (1940), p. 178 \\\\varphi_m(x), defined as :\\\\varphi_m(x)=E_{-m}(x).

The indefinite integral: : \\\\operatorname{Ei}(a \\\\cdot b) = \\\\iint e^{a b} \\\\, da \\\\, db is similar in form to the ordinary generating function for d(n), the number of divisors of n: : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} d(n)x^{n} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{a=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\sum\\\\limits_{b=1}^{\\\\infty} x^{a b} Derivatives The derivatives of the generalised functions E_n can be calculated by means of the formula Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 230, 5.1.26 : E_n '(z) = - E_{n-1}(z) \\\\qquad (n=1,2,3,\\\\ldots) Note that the function E_0 is easy to evaluate (making this recursion useful), since it is just e^{-z}/z.Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 229, 5.1.24 Exponential integral of imaginary argument right200pxthumbE_1(ix) against x; real part black, imaginary part red.

Approximations  There have been a number of approximations for the exponential integral function.

Nine people were killed, including two company directors, and 33 injured, 15 seriously. The four-storey building was largely destroyed. Response Approximately 100 people worked in the four-storey building. At midday BST (11:00 UTC), an explosion occurred and the building collapse occurred instantly. The first service to attend were a Patient Transport Ambulance crew who took the decision to divert straight to the scene because they were so close at the time of the explosion. This initial crew saved dozens of lives by taking control of the evacuation and pulling the injured to safety. Around a dozen were trapped in the rubble. Fire crews used specialist search-and-rescue equipment, including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors (which detect the respired carbon dioxide of trapped persons), thermal-imaging equipment, and fibre-optic cameras to search for people trapped in the collapsed building. Some trapped workers were able to make themselves heard by shouting, or by using their mobile phones. Fire and Ambulance crews pulled seven people alive from the rubble on 11 May. The search through the factory's ruins continued for the following three days. Up to 300 firefighters and paramedics were present at the scene and were supported by, the crew of a Sea King rescue helicopter from RAF Leconfield, North Yorkshire, and a sniffer dog team from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. The volunteer group International Rescue Corps, who specialise in travelling to the site of earthquakes and helping locate survivors, sent eleven of its Scottish members to the scene. The injured were taken for treatment to five hospitals in Glasgow; the most patients were taken to Stobhill Hospital, Western Infirmary and Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and the remaining were treated at Southern General and Victoria Infirmary. Seven people were declared dead at the scene, and two died in Western Infirmary. One firefighter was taken to hospital after being overcome by fumes, and several were stricken by heat exhaustion while labouring in the hot and humid conditions. By the end of the second day, seven deaths had been declared. After the fourth day, Strathclyde Police had named the deceased as Annette Doyle (32), Peter Ferguson (52), Thomas McAulay (41), Tracey McErlane (27), Ann Trench (34), company directors Stewart McColl (60) and Margaret Brownlie (49), Kenneth Ronald Murray, (45), and Timothy Smith (31). With the recovery of Mr. Smith's body from the site on 14 May, Strathclyde Fire Brigade announced that they believed no hope of recovering live victims remained. Cause Ten weeks after the explosion, the site was returned to the owners, after tonnes of debris were removed from the site for detailed examination. The cause of the explosion was initially unknown. Some press coverage reported eyewitness accounts of gas industrial ovens in the coating department exploding. This has since been shown as unlikely as the gas ovens used on site have been found intact. Another theory investigated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was that there was no explosion. An article in The Scotsman newspaper of 5 October 2004 stated that the HSE was investigating the possibility that heavy machinery and pallets kept on the upper floors caused the floor to collapse, bringing the rest of the building down with it. Other theories included a dust explosion and a build-up of methane beneath the building. However the final inquest of the HSE indicated that the explosion was due to an ignition of gas released by a leak in a pressurised petroleum gas pipe. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tank and pipes that had been installed beneath the factory in the late 1960s had corroded allowing the gas to escape. Confusion over name Although regularly referred to as the \\"Stockline Plastics factory\\", largely due to the signage around the building, the factory was owned by ICL Plastics and indeed a large majority of the work that took place there was for ICL Technical Plastics. The offices on the floors above were used by ICL Plastics, ICL Tech and Stockline Plastics. Stockline Plastics was a distribution company and did not manufacture anything, therefore did not require a factory. Stockline Plastics were not charged at all in relation with the incident as they had no involvement with the factory. Aftermath The Grovepark Fund, established to help the families of those killed and injured in the blast, received a boost when the departing Celtic F.C. star, Henrik Larsson, announced that the shirt he wore in his farewell match against Seville on Tuesday would be auctioned in aid of the appeal. It was expected to attract bids of up to ¬£10,000. A memorial service took place in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 4 July 2004. Another was held at Community Central Hall on 11 May 2005, one year on from the tragic event. Prosecution The Crown Office decided on 17 February to prosecute ICL Plastics Limited and ICL Tech Limited under the Health & Safety at Work Act following a report conducted by the Glasgow Procurator Fiscal and HSE. The company has been accused of: * Failing to maintain pipes carrying hazardous gas; * Failure to ensure the safety of staff and visitors; and * Failing to carry out suitable and sufficient risk assessments. The original hearing date of 12 December 2006 was postponed as \\"The timescale that the defence solicitors have been afforded for their preparation of the case has been significantly less [than the Procurator Fiscal's]\\". The trial, which began on 13 August 2007, concluded on 17 August 2007, with the operators ICL Tech Ltd and ICL Plastics admitting to 4 charges in court. On 28 August 2007 a fine of ¬£200,000 (around $400,000US) was imposed on each of the two companies responsible (ICL Plastics Limited and ICL Tech Limited). Public Inquiry The ICL Inquiry took place in Maryhill Community Central Hall. It occurred after the criminal proceedings were concluded. It started on 2 July 2008, after extensive refurbishment work was carried out on behalf of the Scottish Courts Service to make the venue suitable for the public inquiry. The Crown, the victims' families, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and ICL are all represented. The inquiry examined over 20,000 pages of evidence and took place in two phases. The first was a factual enquiry into what occurred. The second stage, to look at causes and reasons, began in October 2008. The inquiry was chaired by Lord Gill. Roy Martin Q.C., a former Dean of the faculty of Advocates, was lead counsel for the inquiry. In July 2009, Lord Gill's Report was published. As well as being critical of the companies involved, it noted failings by the Health & Safety Executive's supervision and inspection regime. The Report contained various recommendations relating to proper safety protocols concerning the storage and use of liquid petroleum gas. Memorial In May 2007, a memorial garden was unveiled.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed August 8, 2011 tributary of the Susquehanna River in east-central Pennsylvania in the United States. It rises in the Appalachian Mountains in central Schuylkill County and passes through northwest Lebanon County before draining into the Susquehanna at Middletown in Dauphin County. The name \\"Swatara\\" is said to derive from a Susquehannock word, Swahadowry or Schaha-dawa, which means \\"where we feed on eels\\". Geography Swatara Creek rises in the Appalachian Mountains in central Schuylkill County, on Broad Mountain north of the Sharp Mountain ridge, approximately west of Minersville. It flows southwest in a winding course, passing south of Tremont, then cutting south through the ridges of Sharp Mountain and Second Mountain. It passes through Swatara State Park then turns south to pass through Swatara Gap in the Blue Mountain ridge northwest of Lebanon. After emerging from the ridge the creek flows southwest, north of Hershey, past Hummelstown, and joins the Susquehanna at Middletown. It receives Quittapahilla Creek from the east north of Palmyra. History The creek was a significant transportation route in the colonial period of North America up through the late 19th century. A canal linking the Susquehanna and Delaware valleys in southeastern Pennsylvania was first proposed in 1690 by William Penn, the founder of the Pennsylvania Colony. Nearly a century passed before a route for the canal was surveyed by David Rittenhouse and William Smith between 1762 and 1770, the first canal ever surveyed in the United States. Spurred by the 1791 discovery of anthracite in the upper Susquehanna Valley, the Pennsylvania General Assembly chartered two companies to undertake the project: the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company and the Delaware and Schuylkill Navigation Company. At the time of the initial construction in 1792, Philadelphia was involved in an intense rivalry with Baltimore, Maryland, for supremacy as a shipping port. The canal was backed by Philadelphia businessmen as a means to divert commercial traffic from following the Susquehanna downriver to the Chesapeake Bay, its more natural destination. Although the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company project failed for lack of funds, the project was restarted and ultimately completed by its successor company, the Union Canal in 1828. From west to east, the route of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company canal in 1792 was to follow Swatara Creek upstream from Middletown to Quittapahilla Creek, which it then followed upstream past Lebanon and Myerstown to its headwaters. It then crossed overland to Clarks Run at the headwaters of Tulpehocken Creek, following Tulpehocken Creek downstream to Reading on the Schuylkill River. It was to follow the Schuylkill downriver to the Delaware River at Philadelphia. The route of the Union Canal followed the same route up Swatara Creek and continued up the creek to Union Water Works. The canal then went up Clarks Run to the summit and thence by a tunnel over to Lebanon. The upper course above Union Water Works into the mountains provided the route of a feeder to the main canal, as well as providing a route to ship anthracite from the mountains to Philadelphia. On September 8, 2011, the creek reached a record height of near Hershey, following devastating rains from Tropical Storm Lee and remnants of Hurricane Irene, the highest since measurements began in 1975. Farther upstream at the Harpers Tavern gauge, was recorded, making it the worst flooding since 1889. The flooding caused thousands of people to be evacuated from their homes throughout central Pennsylvania, and at least one death.Swatara Creek's record-setting rise Penn Live, September 08, 2011 Several covered bridges once crossed Swatara Creek, including the Fiddler's Elbow Covered Bridge near Hummelstown and Clifton Covered Bridge near Middletown, both destroyed by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The Sand Beach Covered Bridge burned down in 1966 by arson.  Recreation  Today, Swatara Creek is part of a national and statewide water trail system, providing outdoor recreation for families canoeing and kayaking a segment that connects to the Susquehanna River and Captain John Smith water trails.

In virology, coinfection includes simultaneous infection of a single cell by two or more virus particles. An example is the coinfection of liver cells with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus, which can arise incrementally by initial infection followed by superinfection. Global prevalence or incidence of coinfection among humans is unknown, but it is thought to be commonplace, sometimes more common than single infection. Coinfection with helminths affects around 800 million people worldwide. Coinfection is of particular human health importance because pathogen species can interact within the host. The net effect of coinfection on human health is thought to be negative. Interactions can have either positive or negative effects on other parasites. Under positive parasite interactions, disease transmission and progression are enhanced and this is also known as syndemism. Negative parasite interactions include microbial interference when one bacterial species suppresses the virulence or colonisation of other bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa suppressing pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus colony formation. The general patterns of ecological interactions between parasite species are unknown, even among common coinfections such as those between sexually transmitted infections. However, network analysis of a food web of coinfection in humans suggests that there is greater potential for interactions via shared food sources than via the immune system. A globally common coinfection involves tuberculosis and HIV. In some countries, up to 80% of tuberculosis patients are also HIV-positive. The potential for dynamics of these two infectious diseases to be linked has been known for decades. Other common examples of coinfections are AIDS, which involves coinfection of end- stage HIV with opportunistic parasites and polymicrobial infections like Lyme disease with other diseases. Coinfections sometimes can epitomize a zero sum game of bodily resources, and precise viral quantitation demonstrates children co-infected with rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus or parainfluenza virus have lower nasal viral loads than those with rhinovirus alone. Poliovirus Poliovirus is a positive single-stranded RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae. Coinfections appear to be common and several pathways have been identified for transmitting multiple virions to a single host cell.Aguilera ER, Pfeiffer JK. Strength in numbers: Mechanisms of viral co-infection. Virus Res. 2019;265:43-46. doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2019.03.003 These include transmission by virion aggregates, transmission of viral genomes within membrane vesicles, and transmission by bacteria bound by several viral particles. Drake demonstrated that poliovirus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation. That is, when polioviruses were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infections of host cells, viable progeny could be formed even at UV doses that inactivated the virus in single infections. Poliovirus can undergo genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. Kirkegaard and Baltimore presented evidence that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) catalyzes recombination by a copy choice mechanism in which the RdRP switches between (+)ssRNA templates during negative strand synthesis. Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptive mechanism for transmitting an undamaged genome to virus progeny. Examples * Anaplasmosis * Bacteriophage coinfection * GB virus C * HIV-HCV coinfection * HIV-TB coinfection (enhances TB transmission and lethality) * Hepatitis D * Hookworm-malaria coinfection * Mansonella perstans * Trichuriasis * Chikungunya and Dengue coinfection * Dengue and HIV coinfection (suppresses HIV) * Chagas and HIV coinfection * Most sexually transmitted diseases and HIV (enhance HIV transmission) * Some COVID-19 patients, or those who were ill with other coronaviruses, can be co-infected with seasonal influenza (flu) viral strains, certain viral strains that cause the common cold, or can be co-infected with bronchitis or pneumonia from another bacterial or viral micro-organism. Even more dangerous, some of them could already have conditions like tuberculosis or active AIDS that make patients very vulnerable.

Her advocacy particularly focuses on protecting children from abduction and abuse. In recent years Wetterling has become one of the most vocal critics of current sex offender registry laws pointing them as overly broad and unnecessarily causing tremendous harm to many. Her advocacy began after her son Jacob was abducted in 1989 and culminated in passage of federal Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. She was a candidate for the Minnesota Sixth District seat in the United States House of Representatives as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party candidate in 2004 and 2006, losing to Republicans Mark Kennedy and Michele Bachmann respectively. In September 2016, the remains of her son Jacob were discovered and positively identified. Biography Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Wetterling grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota and later moved to St. Joseph, where she raised four children (Amy, Jacob, Trevor and Carmen) with her husband Jerry. On October 22, 1989, their son Jacob, then 11 years old, was abducted at gunpoint by a masked man. An extensive search was carried out, but Jacob and the abductor were not found. Jacob's remains were found on September 1, 2016, 27 years after the abduction. Four months after the abduction, the Wetterlings founded the Jacob Wetterling Foundation, a non- profit organization dedicated to child safety education. Wetterling sent a scathing letter to then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales decrying the dilution of sex offender registration laws and demanding that Congress and the Justice Department fix the flaws that their overzealousness caused. On June 18, 2007, Wetterling was interviewed on air by Minnesota Public Radio and discussed \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" offenders (cases where both parties are teenagers and were dating or were willing participants in the sex). Wetterling has found common ground with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and joined them in declaring the Adam Walsh Act unconstitutional and contrary to public safety. On September 14, 2007, Wetterling reiterated her perception of the harm that current sex offender laws are causing. Political career In the 2004 race for U.S. Representative from Minnesota's 6th District she challenged incumbent Republican Mark Kennedy. Wetterling decided to enter the race after Stillwater lawyer Janet Robert withdrew. Wetterling received a $1,000 campaign contribution donation from U.S. Senate candidate Barack Obama, one of only 3 political contributions listed for Obama that year. Kennedy won the election with 54% of the vote to Wetterling's 46%. Wetterling then entered the race for Mark Dayton's U.S. Senate seat in 2006 when Dayton announced he would not seek reelection. Wetterling withdrew from the race on January 20, 2006, and endorsed Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar of the Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party, who won the election. After leaving the Senate race, Wetterling was publicly asked by Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Mike Hatch to run with him as Lieutenant Governor. Wetterling declined Hatch's offer. On February 3, 2006, Wetterling announced that she would once again run for Congress in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. Wetterling's opponent for the DFL nomination was Elwyn Tinklenberg, former mayor of Blaine, Minnesota. A third DFL candidate, Scott Mortensen, dropped out early on. On May 13, 2006, Wetterling won the DFL endorsement to face Republican state senator Michele Bachmann for the U.S. House seat. Wetterling lost the general election to Bachmann, 50% to 42%. Son's abduction In 1999, for the 10th anniversary of Jacob's abduction, Patty Wetterling decided to write an open letter to the abductor. Minnesota newspapers agreed to print it for her. Wetterling consulted the FBI for advice on how to word the letter. In the letter, Wetterling asks the abductor if Jacob is still with him. She offers compassion for the abductor, and says that all little boys, including the abductor when he was one, deserve a happy childhood. She tells him she's sorry if he did not have one, that she does not see him as an ugly, dirty old man, and that she hopes that if he ever goes fishing and catches something he cooks it for Jacob. She writes that she and her family are looking for answers, that only he can answer them, and that she wants to know what became of Jacob after the kidnapping. The letter generated some tips, but nothing substantial. Also in early 2004, news reports circulated that new evidence was being considered in the abduction of her son. News outlets in the Twin Cities indicated that another boy had been assaulted not long before Jacob disappeared. Police were also ruling out the long-held belief that the abductor had gotten away in a car. In 2010, news reports again focused upon an earth-moving project occurring on the Rassier farm, in close proximity to the Wetterlings' property. (The Wetterlings still live in the vicinity in which Jacob, his brother and a friend were riding at the time Jacob was abducted.) The Stearns County Sheriff, along with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, FBI, were reportedly digging deep into the earth to remove some dirt. They took it away, apparently to be evaluated and tested in the BCA laboratory. On September 1, 2016, a person of interest named in the investigation reportedly decided to cooperate with authorities and led investigators to human remains. On September 3, Wetterling told television station KARE, a local NBC affiliate, that the remains found were indeed those of Jacob's. She said, \\"All I can confirm is that Jacob has been found and our hearts are broken. I am not responding to any media yet as I have no words.\\" Philanthropy Patty Wetterling (in purple) with the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children Wetterling is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.

Examples of this in bacteriology are the overgrowth of endogenous Clostridium difficile that occurs following treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and pneumonia or sepsis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in some immunocompromised patients. In virology, the definition is slightly different. Superinfection is the process by which a cell that has previously been infected by one virus gets co-infected with a different strain of the virus, or another virus, at a later point in time. Viral superinfections may be resistant to the antiviral drug or drugs that were being used to treat the original infection. Viral superinfections may also be less susceptible to the host's immune response. Recent metagenomic analyses have demonstrated that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be associated with superinfection and colonization of other pathogens, such as rhinovirus species and Moraxella spp. In parasitology, superinfection is reinfection of the same genus of parasite, as a person infected by Fasciola hepatica again infected by Fasciola gigantica.

It is a soft, pungent, washed rind cheese made from Normande cow's milk. The normal weight for a round of Livarot is 450 g, though it also comes in other weights. It is sold in cylindrical form with the orangish rind wrapped in 3 to 5 rings of dried reedmace (Typha latifolia). For this reason, it has been referred to as 'colonel', as the rings of dried bullrush resemble the stripes on a colonel's uniform. Sometimes green paper is also used. Its orange colour comes from different sources depending on the manufacturer, but is often annatto. The bacterium Brevibacterium linens is employed in fermentation. Production in 1998 was 1,101 tons, down 12.2% since 1996. Only 12% of Livarot are made from raw, unpasteurised milk.

History  The former town hall (1697) In the 13th century, the current location of the fortress Nieuwpoort was created by Lord Van Liesveld and Lord Van Langerack. The two lords wanted a settlement and in 1270, they both gave some of their property to make this happen. In 1283, the fortress was given the privilege of a town. After a turbulent genesis with plenty of sieges and devastation, with the 17th century more peaceful times started. The city ramparts saved the city from floods in 1809', 14 juin 1809. and 1820. Due to an economical crisis in the 1930s and World War II, the city decayed. In 1970, the Provinciale Staten of South Holland initiated a reconstruction and restoration of the fortress and the city. This work was finished in 1998. Nieuwpoort was a separate municipality until 1986, when it became part of Liesveld. The last has become part of Molenwaard in 2013.

He was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature ten times. Biography Early life and career Silone was born in a rural family, in the town of Pescina in the Abruzzo region. His father, Paolo Tranquilli, died in 1911 and in the 1915 Avezzano earthquake, he lost many of his family members, including his mother, Marianna Delli Quadri. He left his hometown and finished high school. In 1917, Silone joined the Young Socialists group of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), rising to be their leader. He was a founding member of the breakaway Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I) in 1921 and became one of its covert leaders during the Fascist regime. Ignazio's brother Romolo Tranquilli was arrested in 1928 for being a member of the PCI and died in prison in 1931 as a result of the severe beatings he received. Opposition to Stalinism and return to the PSI Silone in the 1920s. Silone left Italy in 1927 on a mission to the Soviet Union and settled in Switzerland in 1930. While there, he declared his opposition to Joseph Stalin and the leadership of Comintern; consequently, he was expelled from the PCI. He suffered from tuberculosis and severe clinical depression and spent nearly a year in Swiss clinics; in Switzerland, Aline Valangin helped and played host to him and other migrants. As he recovered, Silone began writing his first novel, Fontamara, published in German translation in 1933. The English edition, first published by Penguin Books in September 1934, went through frequent reprintings during the 1930s, with the events of the Spanish Civil War and the escalation towards the outbreak of World War II increasing attention for its subject material. The United States Army printed unauthorized versions of Fontamara and Bread and Wine and distributed them to the Italians during the liberation of Italy after 1943. These two books together with The Seed Beneath the Snow form the Abruzzo Trilogy. Silone returned to Italy only in 1944, and two years later he was elected as a PSI deputy. In the course of World War II, he had become the leader of a clandestine socialist organization operating from Switzerland to support resistance groups in Nazi Germany-occupied Northern Italy. He also became an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) agent under the pseudonym of Len. Following his contribution to the anti-communist anthology The God That Failed (1949), Silone joined the Congress of Cultural Freedom and edited Tempo Presente. In 1967, with the discovery that the journal received secret funds from the United States Central Intelligence Agency, Silone resigned and devoted all his energies to the writing of novels and autobiographical essays. In 1969, he was awarded the Jerusalem Prize, a literary award for writers who deal with the theme of individual freedom and society. In 1971, he was the recipient of the prestigious Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. Controversy Silone in his last years. In the 1990s, Italian historians Dario Biocca and Mauro Canali found documents which implicated that Silone acted as an informant for the Fascist police from 1919 until 1930. It is believed that the reason he broke from the Fascist police is because of the torture the police inflicted upon his brother. The two historians published the results of their research in a work titled L'informatore. Silone, i comunisti e la polizia. A 2005 biography by Biocca also includes documents showing Silone's involvement with the American intelligence (the OSS) during and after the World War, Biocca suggesting that Silone's political stands (as well as extensive literary work) be reconsidered in light of a more complex personality and political engagements. Personal life Ignazio Silone was married to Darina Laracy (1917-2003), an Irish student of Italian literature and journalist. He died in Geneva, Switzerland in 1978.

Cancellation The series was cancelled after airing only one episode, as a result of poor ratings - 1.7 million saw the programme in its Saturday night prime time slot. With low ratings, ITV decided to replace the following week's episode, 29 July 2006, with a repeat of outtakes show It'll Be Alright on the Night.

Interrupts generated by peripherals may be processed slowly, or indefinitely delayed. The concept of CPU-bounding was developed during early computers, when data paths between computer components were simpler, and it was possible to visually see one component working while another was idle. Example components were CPU, tape drives, hard disks, card- readers, and printers. Computers that predominantly used peripherals were characterized as I/O bound. Establishing that a computer is frequently CPU- bound implies that upgrading the CPU or optimizing code will improve the overall computer performance. With the advent of multiple buses, parallel processing, multiprogramming, preemptive scheduling, advanced graphics cards, advanced sound cards and generally, more decentralized loads, it became less likely to identify one particular component as always being a bottleneck. It is likely that a computer's bottleneck shifts rapidly between components. Furthermore, in modern computers it is possible to have 100% CPU utilization with minimal impact to another component. Finally, tasks required of modern computers often emphasize quite different components, so that resolving a bottleneck for one task may not affect the performance of another. For these reasons, upgrading a CPU does not always have a dramatic effect. The concept of being CPU-bound is now one of many factors considered in modern computer performance.

Osric was probably a son of Eanhere, a previous King of the Hwicce, by Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria. The only marriage recorded for Osthryth is that to √Üthelred of Mercia, but an earlier marriage to Eanhere would explain why Osric and his brother Oswald are described as √Üthelred's nepotes ‚Äî usually translated as nephews or grandsons, but here probably meaning stepsons.John Leland, Collectanea, vol. 1, p. 240. Osric is claimed as the founder of two monastic houses, one at Bath (now Bath Abbey) and the other at Gloucester (now Gloucester Cathedral). In 676 Osric granted lands to Abbess Bertana to found a convent at Bath. The charter attesting this grant S51 has been queried on several grounds of later editing and interpolation, but probably has an authentic basis.H. P. R. Finberg, The Early Charters of the West Midlands (Leicester, 1961), pp. 172-4. The foundation charter of Gloucester Abbey survives in a medieval register of the abbey. It is not straightforward, but again is considered to have an authentic basis.H. P. R. Finberg, The Early Charters of the West Midlands (Leicester, 1961), pp. 158-61. The charter was apparently issued in the 670s by √Üthelred, king of Mercia, and records his grant of lands at Gloucester and Pershore to two of his thegns, noblemen of the Hwicce, Osric and his brother Oswald. Osric's share was at Gloucester, and he sought permission from √Üthelred to found a monastery there. The story of the abbey's foundation continues in the register with the claim that Osric granted the land for the abbey to his sister Kyneburge (Cyneburh), the first abbess.Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancte Petri Gloucestriae ed. W.H. Hunt (Rolls Series), vol.1 (1863), p.lxxii. H.P.R. Finberg however speculates that the Cyneburh in question was the widow of Oswald of Northumbria. Oswald was the elder brother of Oswiu and therefore the uncle of Queen Osthryth, who is said to have encouraged her aunt Cyneburh to enter a nunnery many years after Oswald's death.H.P.R.Finberg, The Early Charters of the West Midlands (Leicester 1961), p.165. Cyneburgh would therefore be the great-aunt of Osric, rather than his sister. Though the charter of Gloucester treats Osric as a subordinate of √Üthelred, the charter of Bath describes him as king of the Hwicce. He is also so described by Bede. He may possibly be the Osric who witnessedS 1165 a doubtful charter of Frithuwold, King of Surrey, dated 675. Osric was buried at Gloucester Abbey beside Cyneburh, before the altar of St Petronilla;Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancte Petri Gloucestriae ed. W.H. Hunt (Rolls Series), vol.1 (1863), p.6. his remains now lie in a medieval tomb in the cathedral. He seems to have been survived by his brother Oshere, and succeeded by a possible son √Üthelmod (mentioned in charter S 1167).

The band's name was taken from the time-traveling anti-hero of Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five. The name was adopted in 1994; prior to that the duo simply billed itself as Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush. The band has released two albums on a major record label (Billy Pilgrim, Bloom) and several independently. The songs \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" and \\"Sweet Louisiana Sound\\" were released as singles. History Kristian Bush and Andrew Hyra (a brother of actress Meg Ryan) first began performing together in 1990. After about a year, they started recording their songs to tape. The self-release St. Christopher's Crossing was recorded in two days in a studio in Knoxville, Tennessee and appeared in 1991 (credited to \\"Andrew Hyra & Kristian Bush\\") on cassette. The album was released on CD in 1992 when Amy Ray of Indigo Girls helped them with the release costs. Playing hundreds of shows in the Southeast, their effort was noticed and they proceeded to record their second album Words Like Numbers under the indie label Sister Ruby. After this they signed to Atlantic Records, naming the group Billy Pilgrim. In 1993 Billy Pilgrim recorded their debut album Billy Pilgrim at Nickel and Dime Studios, with Don McCollister producing and Hugh Padgham mixing the record. The eponymous album was a moderate success when released in 1994. With the next album, Bloom, the band launched a fall tour, headlining larger venues than they had in the past. Yet in early 1996, the band was dropped by Atlantic. After releasing several albums through Internet only, the album In the Time Machine became their last effort to date, released on May 12, 2001. An update on the band's website indicates that Billy Pilgrim are not currently active, but no official disbanding has been announced. In 2016 Billy Pilgrim reunited during the annual Thanksgiving shows Kristian Bush gave in Decatur, Georgia. It was the first time in 15 years they shared the stage. Their single \\"Insomniac\\" (written by Bush) has been a favorite of numerous a cappella groups. Other projects Both Hyra and Bush have released solo albums and worked with other musicians. Bush formed the country music group Sugarland in 2002 with Jennifer Nettles and Kristen Hall (who left in 2006, reducing Sugarland to a duo). Hyra released a solo album, Lost Songs, in 2006Andrewhyra.com Lost Songs album info and another, Curios, in 2011. Hyra is now in a band with Brian Bristow called the Smokin' Novas.

The pathway and stoichiometry of halogenation depends on the structural features and functional groups of the organic substrate, as well as on the specific halogen. Inorganic compounds such as metals also undergo halogenation. Organic chemistry  Halogenation by reaction type  Several pathways exist for the halogenation of organic compounds, including free radical halogenation, ketone halogenation, electrophilic halogenation, and halogen addition reaction. The structure of the substrate is one factor that determines the pathway. = Free radical halogenation = Saturated hydrocarbons typically do not add halogens but undergo free radical halogenation, involving substitution of hydrogen atoms by halogen. The regiochemistry of the halogenation of alkanes is usually determined by the relative weakness of the available C‚ÄìH bonds. The preference for reaction at tertiary and secondary positions results from greater stability of the corresponding free radicals and the transition state leading to them. Free radical halogenation is used for the industrial production of chlorinated methanes:M. Rossberg et al. ‚ÄúChlorinated Hydrocarbons‚Äù in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. :CH4 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí CH3Cl + HCl Rearrangement often accompany such free radical reactions. = Addition of halogens to alkenes and alkynes = Unsaturated compounds, especially alkenes and alkynes, add halogens: :RCH=CHR‚Ä≤ + X2 ‚Üí RCHX‚ÄìCHXR‚Ä≤ The addition of halogens to alkenes proceeds via intermediate halonium ions. In special cases, such intermediates have been isolated. :Structure of a bromonium ion =Halogenation of aromatic compounds= Aromatic compounds are subject to electrophilic halogenation:Illustrative procedure for chlorination of an aromatic compound: :RC6H5 \\\\+ X2 ‚Üí HX + RC6H4X This reaction works only for chlorine and bromine and is carried in the presence of a Lewis acid such as FeX3 (laboratory method). The role of the Lewis acid is to polarize the halogen-halogen bond, making the halogen molecule more electrophilic. Industrially, this is done by treating the aromatic compound with X2 in the presence of iron metal. When the halogen is pumped into the reaction vessel, it reacts with iron, generating FeX3 in catalytic amounts. The reaction mechanismOrganic chemistry by Jonathan Clayden, Nick Grieves, Stuart Warren, Oxford University Press can be represented as follows: 400x400px Because fluorine is very reactive, the protocol described above would not be efficient as the aromatic molecule would react destructively with F2. Therefore, other methods, such as the Balz‚ÄìSchiemann reaction, must be used to prepare fluorinated aromatic compounds. For iodine, however, oxidising conditions must be used in order to perform iodination. Because iodination is a reversible process, the products have to be removed from the reaction medium in order to drive the reaction forward, see Le Chatelier's principle. This can be done by conducting the reaction in the presence of an oxidising agent that oxidises HI to I2, thus removing HI from the reaction and generating more iodine that can further react. The reaction steps involved in iodination are the following: 400x400px Another method to obtain aromatic iodides is the Sandmeyer reaction. =Other halogenation methods= In the Hunsdiecker reaction, from carboxylic acids are converted to the chain-shortened halide. The carboxylic acid is first converted to its silver salt, which is then oxidized with halogen: :RCO2Ag + Br2 ‚Üí RBr + CO2 \\\\+ AgBr The Sandmeyer reaction is used to give aryl halides from diazonium salts, which are obtained from anilines. In the Hell‚ÄìVolhard‚ÄìZelinsky halogenation, carboxylic acids are alpha-halogenated. In oxychlorination, the combination of hydrogen chloride and oxygen serves as the equivalent of chlorine, as illustrated by this route to dichloroethane: :2 HCl + CH2=CH2 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí ClCH2CH2Cl + H2O  Halogenation by halogen type  The facility of halogenation is influenced by the halogen. Fluorine and chlorine are more electrophilic and are more aggressive halogenating agents. Bromine is a weaker halogenating agent than both fluorine and chlorine, while iodine is the least reactive of them all. The facility of dehydrohalogenation follows the reverse trend: iodine is most easily removed from organic compounds, and organofluorine compounds are highly stable. = Fluorination = Organic compounds, saturated and unsaturated alike, react readily, usually explosively, with fluorine. Fluorination with elemental fluorine (F2) requires highly specialised conditions and apparatus. Many commercially important organic compounds are fluorinated electrochemically using hydrogen fluoride as the source of fluorine. The method is called electrochemical fluorination. Aside from F2 and its electrochemically generated equivalent, a variety of fluorinating reagents are known such as xenon difluoride and cobalt(III) fluoride. = Chlorination = Chlorination is generally highly exothermic. Both saturated and unsaturated compounds react directly with chlorine, the former usually requiring UV light to initiate homolysis of chlorine. Chlorination is conducted on a large scale industrially; major processes include routes to 1,2-dichloroethane (a precursor to PVC), as well as various chlorinated ethanes, as solvents. =Bromination= Bromination is more selective than chlorination because the reaction is less exothermic. Most commonly bromination is conducted by the addition of Br2 to alkenes. An example of bromination is the organic synthesis of the anesthetic halothane from trichloroethylene:Synthesis of essential drugs, Ruben Vardanyan, Victor Hruby; Elsevier 2005 :Halothane synthesis Organobromine compounds are the most common organohalides in nature. Their formation is catalyzed by the enzyme bromoperoxidase which utilizes bromide in combination with oxygen as an oxidant. The oceans are estimated to release 1‚Äì2 million tons of bromoform and 56,000 tons of bromomethane annually.Gordon W. Gribble ‚ÄúThe diversity of naturally occurring organobromine compounds‚Äù Chemical Society Reviews, 1999, volume 28, pages 335‚Äì346. =Iodination= Iodine is the least reactive halogen and is reluctant to react with most organic compounds. The addition of iodine to alkenes is the basis of the analytical method called the iodine number, a measure of the degree of unsaturation for fats. The iodoform reaction involves degradation of methyl ketones. Inorganic chemistry All elements aside from argon, neon, and helium form fluorides by direct reaction with fluorine. Chlorine is slightly more selective, but still reacts with most metals and heavier nonmetals. Following the usual trend, bromine is less reactive and iodine least of all. Of the many reactions possible, illustrative is the formation of gold(III) chloride by the chlorination of gold. The chlorination of metals is usually not very important industrially since the chlorides are more easily made from the oxides and the hydrogen halide. Where chlorination of inorganic compounds is practiced on a relatively large scale is for the production of phosphorus trichloride and sulfur monochloride.

IV7 (FACE becomes FACE).Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, seventh edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill), p. 270\\\\. . In music, tonicization is the treatment of a pitch other than the overall tonic (the \\"home note\\" of a piece) as a temporary tonic in a composition. In Western music that is tonal, the piece is heard by the listener as being in a certain key. A tonic chord has a dominant chord; in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major and the dominant chord is G major or G dominant seventh. The dominant chord, especially if it is a dominant seventh, is heard by Western composers and listeners familiar with music as resolving (or \\"leading\\") to the tonic, due to the use of the leading note in the dominant chord. A tonicized chord is a chord other than the tonic chord to which a dominant or dominant seventh chord progresses. When a dominant chord or dominant seventh chord is used before a chord other than the tonic, this dominant or dominant seventh chord is called a secondary dominant.Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010). Graduate Review of Tonal Theory. New York: Oxford University Press, pg 137. When a chord is tonicized, this makes this non-tonic chord sound temporarily like a tonic chord. Examples Using Roman numeral chord analysis, a chord labeled \\"V/ii\\" (colloquially referred to as \\"five of two\\") would refer to the V chord of a different key; specifically, a key named after the ii chord of the original tonic. This would usually resolve to the ii chord (of the original key). In this situation, the ii has been tonicized. For example, in a piece in the key of C major, the ii chord is D minor, because D is the second scale degree in a C major scale. The D is minor because to construct a triad over D using only the pitches available in the key of C major‚Äîi.e. no sharps, no flats‚Äîthe triad must be minor‚Äîthe individual notes D, F and A. The V/ii chord is composed of the pitches in a V chord in the key of ii (key of D minor). The pitches used in a V/ii in this example include the notes A, C# and E (creating an A major chord). In the key of D minor, an A major chord is the dominant chord. In the key of C major, C sharp is an accidental. One can often find examples of tonicization by looking for accidentals, as there are always accidentals involved in tonicization. However, it is important to note that the opposite is not true‚Äîjust because there is an accidental does not mean that it is definitely a case of tonicization. Only major and minor chords may be tonicized. Diminished chords and augmented chords cannot be tonicized because they do not represent stable key areas in Western music. For example, a B minor chord (B, D, F#) occurring in any of its closely related keys may be tonicized with an F# major chord (V/V) because B minor also represents a key area‚Äîthe key of B minor. However, a B diminished chord (B, D, F) may not be tonicized because \\"B diminished\\" could not be a stable key area; there is no key area in Western classical music that has B, D, & F‚Äîthe pitches that make up the B diminished chord‚Äîas the first, third and fifth scale degrees, respectively. This holds true of all diminished and augmented chords. Tonicizations may last for multiple chords. Taking the example given above with the chord progression V/ii ‚Üí ii, it is possible to extend this sequence backwards. Instead of just V/ii ‚Üí ii, there could be iv/ii ‚Üí V/ii ‚Üí ii (additionally, thinking about the last chord in the sequence: ii, as i/ii, it becomes clear why the phrase \\"temporary tonic\\"‚Äîsee above‚Äîis often used in relation to tonicization). Though perceptions vary Kostka, Stefan and Dorothy Payne (2003). Tonal Harmony, p.289. \\"The line between modulation and tonicization...is not clearly defined in tonal music, nor is it meant to be.\\" . as a general rule if a chord is treated as the tonic for longer than a phrase before returning to the previous key area, then the treatment is considered a modulation to a new key.Gauldin, Robert (1997). Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music New York: W.W. Norton & Company, pg 366. Modulation In a song in C major, if a composer treats another key as the tonic (for example, the ii chord, D minor) for a short period by alternating between A7 (the notes A, C#, E and G) and D minor, and then returns to the tonic (C Major), this is a tonicization of the key of D minor. However, if a song in C major shifts to the key of D minor and stays in this second, new key for a significant period, then this is usually considered to be a modulation to the new key (in this case, from C major to D minor). In effect, D minor has become the new key of the song. \\"A secondary dominant is like a miniature modulation; for just an instant, the harmony moves out of the diatonic chords of the key.\\"Benward & Saker (2003), p.272.

A. Salvatore. It is described as a vast subterranean network of interconnected caverns and tunnels, stretching beneath entire continents and forming an underworld for surface settings. Polygon called it \\"one of D&Ds; most well-known realms\\". Use in campaign settings The Underdark featured prominently in the campaign settings World of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. The concept of a dungeon that spanned a planet was first introduced by Gary Gygax in his D-series of game modules and at the end of the G-series. The Underdark was described in detail in the 1986 manual Dungeoneer's Survival Guide, by Doug Niles. It was also part of the Eberron campaign setting, in which it was called Khyber and was home to evil beings driven deep into the caverns at the end of the age of demons. A review for Pyramid refers to the Underdark as \\"one of the most well known facets of the Forgotten Realms\\". Much of the literary attention for this deep underworld stemmed from the sourcebooks and accessories for the Forgotten Realms setting, including R.A. Salvatore's novels about the fictional character Drizzt Do'Urden. The Underdark was also the setting for the expansion pack to the computer game Neverwinter Nights called Hordes of the Underdark, which featured the port city of Lith My'athar, and the mysterious Seer. Features The Underdark is \\"a vast subterranean realm inhabited by drow, mind flayers, aboleth, and other strange, sinister creatures. It is a place where few humans go and from where even fewer return\\". It extends well past the dungeons made by surface dwellers, encompassing myriad caverns, tunnels and complexes.Pyramid Review Environment The fictional Underdark's physical characteristics are based upon conditions in real-world caverns deep underground, except at immense size. Within the context of a game, the Underdark is extremely dangerous, especially to non-native characters and creatures. There are also the usual dangers associated with caverns: claustrophobia, poor air circulation, floor/ceiling collapses and getting lost. There is no light except for occasional patches of phosphorescent fungus; most Underdark inhabitants either have highly developed senses other than sight or have developed darkvision.This was infravision before the 3rd edition of the game rules. Food can be extremely difficult to find, and much of the natural vegetation is poisonous. In addition, potable water is hard to locate. In the Forgotten Realms setting, the Underdark is permeated with a magical energy the drow call faerzress, which is used as a source of energy by the native plant life and which interferes with scrying and teleportation spells. Araumycos In the Forgotten Realms setting, Araumycos (Dwarvish, literally meaning \\"Great Fungus\\") is an enormous fungal growth in the Upper Underdark under the continent of Faer√ªn. It is a single organism living beneath the High Forest between one and three miles under the surface, immune to magic and resistant to psionic energy. Araumycos will sometimes attack intruders with poison, spores, and manifestations that resemble oozes and slimes. Araumycos houses many other fungal creatures. Travel within it is difficult since many passages and caves are blocked by it and damage regenerates quickly. Inhabitants The Underdark is home to many predators, races and fantasy monsters, most of which are hostile. These include: * Aboleths * Beholders * Drow (dark elves) * Duergar (gray dwarves) * Dwarves * Fomorian * Illithids (Mind Flayers) * Hook horrors * Kuo-toa * Myconids (Fungus-men) * Pech * Svirfneblin (Deep Gnomes) * Troglodyte There is no unified underground government since each individual city-state has a different form of rule. The Underdark economy deals primarily in armor, exotic goods, magic, slaves, timber and weapons. The ethical code of many indigenous races tends toward evil or neutral. In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, R.A. Salvatore created the drow Underdark city Menzoberranzan.  Media   Source books    Game modules    Computer games  Part of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn took place in the Underdark, and Icewind Dale II featured journeys through the Underdark. An expansion pack based on the Underdark setting was released for the Neverwinter Nights game series, titled Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark. The tilesets which came with the Hordes of the Underdark expansion pack were used in several persistent worlds, most notably Escape from the Underdark.

Mustangs are often referred to as wild horses, but because they are descended from once- domesticated horses, they are actually feral horses. The original mustangs were Colonial Spanish horses, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, now resulting in varying phenotypes. Some free-roaming horses are relatively unchanged from the original Spanish stock, most strongly represented in the most isolated populations. In 1971, the United States Congress recognized that \\"wild free-roaming horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, which continue to contribute to the diversity of life forms within the Nation and enrich the lives of the American people\\". The free-roaming horse population is managed and protected by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Controversy surrounds the sharing of land and resources by mustangs with the livestock of the ranching industry, and also with the methods by which the BLM manages their population numbers. The most common method of population management used is rounding up excess population and offering them to adoption by private individuals. There are inadequate numbers of adopters, so many once free- roaming horses now live in temporary and long-term holding areas with concerns that the animals may be sold for horse meat. Additional debate centers on the question of whether mustangs‚Äîand horses in general‚Äîare a native species or an introduced invasive species in the lands they inhabit. Etymology and usage Although free-roaming Mustangs are called \\"wild\\" horses, they descend from feral domesticated horses. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the English word mustang was likely borrowed from two essentially synonymous Spanish words, (or ) and . English lexicographer John Minsheu glossed both words together as 'strayer' in his dictionary of 1599. Both words referred to livestock defined as 'wild, having no master'. was used since the 13th century, while is attested from the late 15th. referred originally to beasts of uncertain ownership distributed by the powerful transhumant merino sheep ranchers' guild in medieval Spain, called the Mesta (). The name of the Mesta derived ultimately from the , referring to the common ownership of the guild's animals by multiple parties. The OED states that the origin of is \\"obscure\\" but notes the is attested from the 15th century. In Spanish, mustangs are named . By 1936, the English 'mustang' had been loaned back into Spanish as . \\"Mustangers\\" () were cowboys () who caught, broke, and drove free-ranging horses to market in the Spanish and later American territories of what is now northern Mexico, Texas, New Mexico, and California. They caught the horses that roamed the Great Plains, the San Joaquin Valley of California, and later the Great Basin, from the 18th century to the early 20th century. Characteristics and ancestry Mustang mare and foal with stallion The original mustangs were Colonial Spanish horses, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, resulting in varying phenotypes. Mustangs of all body types are described as surefooted and having good endurance. They may be of any coat color. Throughout all the Herd Management Areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management, light riding horse type predominates, though a few horses with draft horse characteristics also exist, mostly kept separate from other mustangs and confined to specific areas. Some herds show the signs of the introduction of Thoroughbred or other light racehorse-types into herds, a process that also led in part to the creation of the American Quarter Horse. The mustang of the modern west has several different breeding populations today which are genetically isolated from one another and thus have distinct traits traceable to particular herds. Genetic contributions to today's free-roaming mustang herds include assorted ranch horses that escaped to or were turned out on the public lands, and stray horses used by the United States Cavalry. For example, in Idaho some Herd Management Areas (HMA) contain animals with known descent from Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse stallions turned out with feral herds. The herds located in two HMAs in central Nevada produce Curly Horses. Others, such as certain bands in Wyoming, have characteristics consistent with gaited horse breeds. Many herds were analyzed for Spanish blood group polymorphism (commonly known as \\"blood markers\\") and microsatellite DNA loci. Blood marker analysis verified a few to have significant Spanish ancestry, namely the Cerbat mustang, Pryor Mountain mustang, and some horses from the Sulphur Springs HMA. The Kiger mustang is also said to have been found to have Spanish blood and subsequent microsatellite DNA confirmed the Spanish ancestry of the Pryor Mountain mustang. Horses in several other HMAs exhibit Spanish horse traits, such as dun coloration and primitive markings. Genetic studies of other herds show various blends of Spanish, gaited horse, draft horse, and pony influences. Height varies across the west, however, most are small, generally , and not taller than , even in herds with draft or Thoroughbred ancestry. Some breeders of domestic horses consider the mustang herds of the west to be inbred and of inferior quality. However, supporters of the mustang argue that the animals are merely small due to their harsh living conditions and that natural selection has eliminated many traits that lead to weakness or inferiority. The now-defunct American Mustang Association developed a breed standard for those mustangs that carry morphological traits associated with the early Spanish horses. These include a well-proportioned body with a clean, refined head with wide forehead and small muzzle. The facial profile may be straight or slightly convex. Withers are moderate in height, and the shoulder is to be \\"long and sloping\\". The standard considers a very short back, deep girth and muscular coupling over the loins as desirable. The croup is rounded, neither too flat nor goose-rumped. The tail is low-set. The legs are to be straight and sound. Hooves are round and dense. Dun color dilution and primitive markings are particularly common among horses of Spanish type.Mustangs in Utah History 1493‚Äì1600 Modern horses were first brought to the Americas with the conquistadors, beginning with Columbus, who imported horses from Spain to the West Indies on his second voyage in 1493.Bennett, p. 14 Horses came to the mainland with the arrival of Cort√©s in 1519.Bennett, p. 193 By 1525, Cort√©s had imported enough horses to create a nucleus of horse-breeding in Mexico.Bennett, p. 205 One hypothesis held that horse populations north of Mexico originated in the mid-1500s with the expeditions of Narv√°ez, de Soto or Coronado, but it has been refuted.Haines, \\"Where Did the Plains Indians Get Their Horses?\\", January 1938Bennett, pp. 329‚Äì331 Horse breeding in sufficient numbers to establish a self-sustaining population developed in what today is the southwestern United States starting in 1598 when Juan de O√±ate founded Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. From 75 horses in his original expedition, he expanded his herd to 800, and from there the horse population increased rapidly. Dispersal of horses, 1600-1775 While the Spanish also brought horses to Florida in the 16th century,Bennett, 345 the Choctaw and Chickasaw horses of what is now the southeastern United States are believed to be descended from western mustangs that moved east, and thus Spanish horses in Florida did not influence the mustang. 17th- and 18th-century dispersal Native American people readily integrated use of the horse into their cultures. They quickly adopted the horse as a primary means of transportation. Horses replaced the dog as a pack animal and changed Native cultures in terms of warfare, trade, and even diet‚Äîthe ability to run down bison allowed some people to abandon agriculture for hunting from horseback. Santa Fe became a major trading center in the 1600s.Haines, \\"Where Did the Plains Indians Get Their Horses?\\", January 1938, p. 117 Although Spanish laws prohibited Native Americans from riding horses, the Spanish used Native people as servants, and some were tasked to care for livestock, thus learning horse-handling skills.Haines, \\"The Northward Spread of Horses Among the Plains Indians\\", July 1938, p. 430 O√±ate's colonists also lost many of their horses.de Steiguer, p. 70 Some wandered off because the Spanish generally did not keep them in fenced enclosures,Bennett, p. 330 and Native people in the area captured some of these estrays. Other horses were traded by O√±ate' settlers for food, women or other goods. Initially, horses obtained by Native people were simply eaten, along with any cattle that were captured or stolen.Dobie, p. 36 But as individuals with horse-handling skills fled Spanish control, sometimes with a few trained horses, the local tribes began using horses for riding and as pack animals. By 1659, settlements reported being raided for horses, and in the 1660s the \\"Apache\\" were trading human captives for horses.Haines, \\"The Northward Spread of Horses Among the Plains Indians\\", July 1938, p. 431 The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 also resulted in large numbers of horses coming into the hands of Native people, the largest one-time influx in history. From the Pueblo people, horses were traded to the Apache, Navajo and Utes. The Comanche acquired horses and provided them to the Shoshone. The Eastern Shoshone and Southern Utes became traders who distributed horses and horse culture from New Mexico to the northern plains. West of the Continental Divide, horses distribution moved north quite rapidly along the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, skirting desert regions such as the Great Basin and the western Colorado Plateau. Horses reached what today is southern Idaho by 1690. The Northern Shoshone people in the Snake River valley had horses in 1700.Bennett, p. 388 By 1730, they reached the Columbia Basin and were east of the Continental divide in the northern Great Plains. The Blackfeet people of Alberta had horses by 1750. The Nez Perce people in particular became master horse breeders, and developed one of the first distinctly American breeds, the Appaloosa. Most other tribes did not practice extensive amounts of selective breeding, though they sought out desirable horses through acquisition and quickly culled those with undesirable traits. By 1769, most Plain Indians had horses.Dobie, p. 41 In this period, Spanish missions were also a source of stray and stolen livestock, particularly in what today is Texas and California.de Steiguer, pp. 73‚Äì74 The Spanish brought horses to California for use at their missions and ranches, where permanent settlements were established in 1769. Horse numbers grew rapidly, with a population of 24,000 horses reported by 1800.Bennett, p. 374 By 1805, there were so many horses in California that people began to simply kill unwanted animals to reduce overpopulation.de Steiguer, p. 76 However, due to the barriers presented by mountain ranges and deserts, the California population did not significantly influence horse numbers elsewhere at the time. Horses in California were described as being of \\"exceptional quality\\". In the upper Mississippi basin and Great Lakes regions, the French were another source of horses. Although horse trading with native people was prohibited, there were individuals willing to indulge in illegal dealing, and as early as 1675, the Illinois people had horses. Animals identified as \\"Canadian\\", \\"French\\", or \\"Norman\\" were located in the Great Lakes region, with a 1782 census at Fort Detroit listing over 1000 animals.Bennett, pp. 384‚Äì385 By 1770, Spanish horses were found in that area, and there was a clear zone from Ontario and Saskatchewan to St. Louis where Canadian-type horses, particularly the smaller varieties, crossbred with mustangs of Spanish ancestry. French-Canadian horses were also allowed to roam freely, and moved west, particularly influencing horse herds in the northern plains and inland northwest. Comanche territory, 1850, region roughly corresponds to the location of the greatest numbers of feral horses in 1800 Although horses were brought from Mexico to Texas as early as 1542, a stable population did not exist until 1686, when Alonso de Le√≥n's expedition arrived with 700 horses. From there, later groups brought up thousands more, deliberately leaving some horses and cattle to fend for themselves at various locations, while others strayed.de Steiguer, p. 74 By 1787, these animals had multiplied to the point that a roundup gathered nearly 8,000 \\"free-roaming mustangs and cattle\\".de Steiguer, p. 75 West-central Texas, between the Rio Grande and Palo Duro Canyon, was said to have the most concentrated population of feral horses in the Americas. Throughout the west, horses escaped human control and formed feral herds, and by the late 1700s, the largest numbers were found in what today are the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico.McKnight, pp. 511‚Äì513 19th century An early 19th-century reference to mustangs by American sources came from Zebulon Pike, who in 1808 noted passing herds of \\"mustangs or wild horses\\". In 1821, Stephen Austin noted in his journal that he had seen about 150 mustangs. Estimates of when the peak population of mustangs occurred and total numbers vary widely between sources. No comprehensive census of feral horse numbers was ever performed until the time of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 and any earlier estimates, particularly prior to the 20th century, are speculative. Some sources simply state that \\"millions\\" of mustangs once roamed western North America.Ryden, America's Last Wild Horses, p. 129Wyman, p. 91 In 1959, geographer Tom L. McKnight suggested that the population peaked in the late 1700s or early 1800s, and the \\"best guesses apparently lie between two and five million\\". Historian J. Frank Dobie hypothesized that the population peaked around the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848, stating: \\"My own guess is that at no time were there more than a million mustangs in Texas and no more than a million others scattered over the remainder of the West.\\"Dobie, p. 108 J. Edward de Steiguer questioned Dobie's lower guess as still being too high.de Steiguer, loc2253, Chapter 7: America sweeps onto the Great Plains In 1839, the numbers of mustangs in Texas had been augmented by animals abandoned by Mexican settlers who had been ordered to leave the Nueces Strip.Dobie, pp. 108‚Äì109 Ulysses Grant, in his memoir, recalled seeing in 1846 an immense herd between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande in Texas: \\"As far as the eye could reach to our right, the herd extended. To the left, it extended equally. There was no estimating the number of animals in it; I have no idea that they could all have been corralled in the state of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time.\\" When the area was ceded to the U.S. in 1848, these horses and others in the surrounding areas were rounded up and trailed north and east,Dobie, p. 316 resulting in the near-elimination of mustangs in that area by 1860. Farther west, the first known sighting of a free-roaming horse in the Great Basin was by John Bidwell near the Humboldt Sinks in 1841. Although John Charles Fremont noted thousands of horses in California,Morin, Honest Horses, p. 3\\" the only horse sign he spoke of in the Great Basin, which he named, was tracks around Pyramid Lake, and the natives he encountered there were horseless.Berger, Wild Horses, p. 36. In 1861, another party saw seven free-roaming horses near the Stillwater Range.Young and Sparks, Cattle in the Cold Desert, p. 215 For the most part, free-roaming horse herds in the interior of Nevada were established in the latter part of the 1800s from escaped settlers' horses.Young and Sparks, Cattle in the Cold Desert, pp. 216‚Äì217de Steiguer, loc2595  20th century  In the early 1900s, thousands of free-roaming horses were rounded up for use in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. By 1920, Bob Brislawn, who worked as a packer for the U.S. government, recognized that the original mustangs were disappearing, and made efforts to preserve them, ultimately establishing the Spanish Mustang Registry. In 1934, J. Frank Dobie stated that there were just \\"a few wild [feral] horses in Nevada, Wyoming and other Western states\\" and that \\"only a trace of Spanish blood is left in most of them\\"Dobie, p. 321 remaining. Other sources agree that by that time, only \\"pockets\\" of mustangs that retained Colonial Spanish Horse type remained.Amaral, Mustang, p. 12 By 1930, the vast majority of free-roaming horses were found west of Continental Divide, with an estimated population between 50,000‚Äì150,000.Wyman, p. 161 They were almost completely confined to the remaining General Land Office (GLO)-administered public lands and National Forest rangelands in the 11 Western States.Sherrets In 1934, the Taylor Grazing Act established the United States Grazing Service to manage livestock grazing on public lands, and in 1946, the GLO was combined with the Grazing Service to form the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which, along with the Forest Service, was committed to removing feral horses from the lands they administered. By the 1950s, the mustang population dropped to an estimated 25,000 horses. Abuses linked to certain capture methods, including hunting from airplanes and poisoning water holes, led to the first federal free- roaming horse protection law in 1959. This statute, titled \\"Use of aircraft or motor vehicles to hunt certain wild horses or burros; pollution of watering holes\\" popularly known as the \\"Wild Horse Annie Act\\", prohibited the use of motor vehicles for capturing free-roaming horses and burros. Protection was increased further by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHABA). The Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 provided for protection of certain previously established herds of horses and burros. It mandated the BLM to oversee the protection and management of free-roaming herds on lands it administered, and gave U.S. Forest Service similar authority on National Forest lands. A few free-ranging horses are also managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, but for the most part they are not subject to management under the Act. A census completed in conjunction with passage of the Act found that there were approximately 17,300 horses (25,300 combined population of horses and burros) on the BLM-administered lands and 2,039 on National Forests. Mustangs today Nevada's State Quarter, featuring the mustang The BLM has established Herd Management Areas to determine where horses will be sustained as free- roaming populations. The BLM has established \\"Appropriate Management Levels\\" (AML) for each HMA, totaling 26,000 bureau-wide, but the on-range mustang population in August 2017 was estimated to be over 72,000 horses. More than half of all free-roaming mustangs in North America are found in Nevada (which features the horses on its State Quarter), with other significant populations in California, Oregon, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Another 45,000 horses are in holding facilities. Land use controversies Prehistoric context The horse, clade Equidae, originated in North America 55 million years ago. By the end of the Late Pleistocene, there were two lineages of the equine family known to exist in North America: the \\"caballine\\" or \\"stout-legged horse\\" belonging to the genus Equus, and Haringtonhippus francisci, the \\"stilt-legged horse\\". Recent studies of ancient DNA suggest that the North American caballine horses included the ancestor of the modern horse. At the end of the Last Glacial Period, the non-caballines went extinct and the caballines were extirpated from the Americas. Multiple factors that included changing climate and the impact of newly arrived human hunters may have been to blame. Thus, prior to the Columbian Exchange, the youngest physical evidence (macrofossils- generally bones or teeth) for the survival of Equids in the Americas dates between ‚âà10,500 and 7,600 years before present. Modern issues Due in part to the prehistory of the horse, there is controversy as to the role mustangs have in the ecosystem as well as their rank in the prioritized use of public lands, particularly in relation to livestock. There are multiple viewpoints. Some supporters of mustangs on public lands asserts that, while not native, mustangs are a \\"culturally significant\\" part of the American West, and acknowledge some form of population control is needed. Another viewpoint is that mustangs reinhabited an ecological niche vacated when horses went extinct in North America, with a variant characterization that horses are a reintroduced native species that should be legally classified as \\"wild\\" rather than \\"feral\\" and managed as wildlife. The \\"native species\\" argument centers on the premise that the horses extirpated in the Americas 10,000 years ago are closely related to the modern horse as was reintroduced. Thus, this debate centers in part around the question of whether horses developed an ecomorphotype adapted to the ecosystem as it changed in the intervening 10,000 years. The Wildlife Society views mustangs as an introduced species stating: \\"Since native North American horses went extinct, the western United States has become more arid ... notably changing the ecosystem and ecological roles horses and burros play.\\" and that they draw resources and attention away from true native species. A 2013 report by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine also challenged the idea of horses being a reintroduced native species stating that \\"the complex of animals and vegetation has changed since horses were extirpated from North America\\". It also stated that the distinction between native or non-native was not the issue, but rather the \\"priority that BLM gives to free- ranging horses and burros on federal lands, relative to other uses\\". Mustang supporters advocates for the BLM to rank mustangs higher in priority than it currently does, arguing that too little forage is allocated to mustangs as opposed to cattle and sheep. Ranchers and others affiliated with the livestock industry favor a lower priority, arguing essentially that their livelihoods and rural economies are threatened because they depend upon the public land forage for their livestock. The debate as to what degree mustangs and cattle compete for forage is multifaceted. Horses are adapted by evolution to inhabit an ecological niche characterized by poor quality vegetation.Budiansky, p. 31 Advocates assert that most current mustang herds live in arid areas which cattle cannot fully utilize due to the lack of water sources. Mustangs can cover vast distances to find food and water;Budiansky, p. 186 advocates assert that horses range 5‚Äì10 times as far as cattle to find forage, finding it in more inaccessible areas. In addition, horses are \\"hindgut fermenters\\", meaning that they digest nutrients by means of the cecum rather than by a multi- chambered stomach.Budiansky, p. 29 While this means that they extract less energy from a given amount of forage, it also means that they can digest food faster and make up the difference in efficiency by increasing their consumption rate. In practical effect, by eating greater quantities, horses can obtain adequate nutrition from poorer forage than can ruminants such as cattle, and so can survive in areas where cattle will starve. However, while the BLM rates horses by animal unit (AUM) to eat the same amount of forage as a cow‚Äìcalf pair, 1.0, studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize re-growth of the forage. Year-round grazing by any non-native ungulate will degrade it, particularly horses whose incisors allow them to graze plants very close to the ground, inhibiting recovery. Management and adoption The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was tasked by Congress with protecting, managing, and controlling free-roaming horses and burros under the authority of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 to ensure that healthy herds thrive on healthy rangelands under the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Difficulty arises because mustang herd sizes can multiply rapidly, increasing up to and possibly by over 20% every year, so population control presents a challenge. When unmanaged, population numbers can outstrip forage available, leading to starvation. There are few predators in the modern era capable of preying on healthy adult mustangs, and for the most part, predators capable of limiting the growth of feral mustang herd sizes are not found in the same habitat as most modern feral herds. Although wolves and mountain lions are two species known to prey on horses and in theory could control population growth, in practice, predation is not a viable population control mechanism. Wolves were historically rare in, and currently do not inhabit, the Great Basin, where the vast majority of mustangs roam. While they are documented to prey on feral horses in Alberta, Canada, there is no known documentation of wolf predation on free-roaming horses in the United States. Mountain lions have been documented to prey on feral horses in the U.S., but in limited areas and small numbers, and mostly foals. One of the BLM's key mandates under the 1971 law and amendments is to maintain AML of wild horses and burros in areas of public rangelands where they are managed by the federal government. Control of the population to within AML is achieved through a capture program, although there are no specific guidelines or techniques used to round up mustangs. Most methods are quite stressful for the animals, even fatal. The BLM allows the use of trucks, ATVs, helicopters, and firearms to chase the horses into holding pens or \\"traps\\". These methods have often resulted in extreme exhaustion, serious injuries, or even death to the horses. \\"Bait\\" traps are another common way mustangs are corralled, usually with hay or water being left in a camouflaged pen while varying types of trigger systems close gates behind the horses. Another, less destructive method uses a tamed horse, called a \\"Judas horse\\", which has been trained to lead wild horses into a pen or corral. Once the mustangs are herded into an area near the holding pen, the Judas horse is released. Its job is then to move to the head of the herd and lead them into a confined area. Since 1978, captured horses have been offered for adoption to individuals or groups willing and able to provide humane, long-term care after payment of an adoption fee; the base fee is $125. Adopted horses are still protected under the Act, for one year after adoption, at which point the adopter can obtain title to the horse. Horses that could not be adopted were to be humanely euthanized. Instead of euthanizing excess horses, the BLM began keeping them in \\"long term holding\\", an expensive alternative that can cost taxpayers up to $50,000 per horse over its lifetime. On December 8, 2004, a rider amending the Wild and Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act was attached to an appropriation bill before the Congress by former Senator Conrad Burns. This modified the adoption program to also allow the unlimited sale of captured horses that are \\"more than 10 years of age\\", or that were \\"offered unsuccessfully for adoption at least three times\\". Since 1978, there had been specific language in the Act forbidding the BLM from selling the horses to those would take them to slaughter, but the Burns Amendment removed that language. In order to prevent horses being sold to slaughter, the BLM has implemented policies limiting sales and requiring buyers to certify they will not take the horses to slaughter. In 2017, the Trump administration began pushing Congress to remove barriers to implementing both the option to euthanize and sell excess horses. Despite such means as the Extreme Mustang Makeover, a promotional competition that gives trainers 100 days to gentle and train 100 mustangs, which are then adopted through an auction, to try increase the number of horses adopted, adoption numbers do not come close to finding homes for the excess horses. Ten thousand foals were expected to be born on range in 2017, whereas only 2500 horses were expected to be adopted. Alternatives to roundups for on range population control include fertility control, either by PZP injection or spaying mares, culling and natural regulation. Captured horses are freeze branded on the left side of the neck by the BLM, using the International Alpha Angle System, a system of angles and alpha-symbols that cannot be altered. The brands begin with a symbol indicating the registering organization, in this case the U.S. Government, then two stacked figures indicating the individual horse's year of birth, then the individual registration number. Captured horses kept in sanctuaries are also marked on the left hip with four inch-high Arabic numerals that are also the last four digits of the freeze brand on the neck.

This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion. Functional theories of leadership are developed by studying successful leaders and identifying the actions and behaviours they show. Large studies with a large amount of data make it possible to correlate what leaders actually do, i.e. their actions or functions with their successful results. In the functional leadership model, leadership does not rest with one person but rests on a set of behaviours by the group that gets things done. Any member of the group can perform these behaviours, so any member can participate in leadership. The Functional theory of leadership, places greater emphasis on how an organisation or task is being led rather than who has been formally assigned a leadership role. One of the best known and most influential of functional theories of leadership, used in many leadership development programmes, is John Adair's \\"Action-Centred Leadership\\". John Adair developed a model of Action-Centred Leadership that has connecting circles that overlap because: * the task can only be performed by the team and not by one person * the team can only achieve excellent task performance if all the individuals are fully developed * the individuals need the task to be challenged and motivated Adair's model challenged trait theory by focusing on what leaders do. He showed that leadership could be taught and did not depend on the traits a person had. The eight functions of leadership Adair noted the following 8 key functions for which team leaders are responsible. (Examples are given in brackets) # Defining the task, (by setting clear objectives through SMART goals) # Planning, (by looking at alternative ways to achieve the task and having contingency plans in case of problems) # Briefing the team, (by creating the right team climate, fostering synergy, and making the most of each individual through knowing them well) # Controlling what happens, (by being efficient in terms of getting maximum results from minimum resources) # Evaluating results, (by assessing consequences and identifying how to improve performance) # Motivating individuals, (by using both external motivators such as rewards and incentives as well as eliciting internal motivators on the part of each team player) # Organising people, (by organising self and others through good time management, personal development, and delegation) # Setting an example, (by the recognition that people observe their leaders and copy what they do). Criticism of the model Some people consider Adair's Three Circles Model too simplistic and to be outdated as it was developed in the 1970s. Implications for the nature versus nurture debate This question of whether leaders are born or made is part of the whole question of whether human behaviour is due to nature or nurture. It is a short leap from functional leadership theory, to the belief that if one person can do something, then others can also learn to do it. The implication that leaders are made and not necessarily born with the necessary traits for leadership, opened up the possibility of leadership development.

Plot In a surreal world where animals and inanimate objects reflect the emotions of humans, Colin is a wealthy young man with a resourceful and stylish valet, Nicholas, and a loyal best friend, Chick. Despite his significant fortune and luxurious lifestyle, Colin is desperate for a lover, even going so far as secretly pining for Chick's girlfriend, Alyssum. Consequently, this overpowering desire compels Colin to instantly fall in love with Chloe, whom he meets at a friend's party. After a whirlwind romance, Colin weds Chloe in a grand ceremony. Generously, Colin bequeaths a quarter of his fortune to Chick and Alyssum so they too may marry despite the former's reluctance to do so. During the honeymoon, Chloe falls ill with a mysterious disease that primarily consists of coughing and chest pain, and she and Colin are forced to end their trip early. Upon returning home, Chloe begins to feel better. However, her recovery is short-lived, and she faints during a shopping trip and her coughing fits return. She is eventually diagnosed with a water lily in the lung, a painful and rare condition that can only be treated by surrounding her with flowers. The expense of the treatment is large and Colin soon exhausts his funds, compelling him to undertake low- paying jobs in an effort to accumulate more money for Chloe's remedy. As Chloe's disease progresses, the apartments of Colin, Chick, and Nicholas all begin to decay, and Nicholas suddenly ages years in a single week. Meanwhile, Chick's obsession with a philosopher Jean-Pulse Heartre causes him to spend all his money, effort and attention on collecting Heartre's literature. Alyssum, who is resentful of Chick's neglect of her in favor of his burgeoning collection, attempts to save him financially and renew his interest in her by persuading Heartre to stop publishing books, whom she kills when he refuses. She then seeks revenge upon the booksellers carrying Heartre's works by murdering them and burning down their stores. Concurrently, Chick receives a surprise visit from the police for tax evasion and contraband tobacco smuggling. His refusal to turn over his Heartre books as payment for his crimes leads to his death from a gunshot fired by one of the policemen at the scene. Ultimately, Colin struggles to provide flowers for Chloe to no avail, and his grief at her death is so strong that his pet mouse commits suicide to escape the gloom.  Characters  * Colin is the amicable protagonist of Froth on the Daydream. At the tender age of 22, Colin has managed to amass a large amount of wealth, which enables him to elude employment and on which he spends on multiple luxuries. Initially, Colin experiences jealousy of his best friend Chick's romantic relationship and longs for his own. However, this desire is quickly fulfilled by Chloe, whom he meets at his friend Isis' party. His loving yet impulsive nature is portrayed by his swift marriage to Chloe, which occurs only a short time after their first meeting. By the end of the novel, he is left devastated and broke after Chloe's untimely death. * Chloe is the girlfriend and later the wife of Colin, with whom she shares Isis as a mutual friend. She is instantly smitten by Colin and marries him soon after a whirlwind romance. During her honeymoon, she contracts a water lily in her lung, a rare disease that has only one cure: surrounding the patient with flowers. Despite her husband's best efforts to provide her treatment, her health quickly deteriorates and she dies, leaving Colin heartbroken. She is based on Boris Vian's first wife, Michelle. * Chick is Colin's devoted and affable best friend. He is an engineer, a career that does not provide him with the same amount of wealth as Colin. Despite his lower socioeconomic status, Chick regularly dines and spends time with Colin. He is currently in a romantic relationship with Alyssum, whom he wants to marry but fears doing so due to his lack of money and the disapproval of her parents. Throughout the novel, he develops an unhealthy obsession with a philosopher, Jean-Pulse Heartre, which compels the former to spend all of his income on the works of the latter. He is ultimately killed after refusing to hand over his Heartre collection to the police as payment for his crimes of tax evasion and contraband smuggling. * Nicholas is the dedicated, diligent, and practical 29-year old servant of Colin. He is renowned for his unique dishes and astounding sense of wisdom. He is also Alyssum's uncle. As Chloe's illness worsens, he suddenly ages years in a week. * Alyssum (aka Alise in the original French edition) is Chick's 18-year old girlfriend, whom he met at one of Heartre's lectures. She is frustrated with Chick's reluctance to marry her and his Heartre addiction, the latter of which causes him to ignore her. Eventually, she descends into a murderous rage after an unsuccessful attempt to convince Heartre to stop publishing books. * Isis is an 18-year old socialite and the friend of Colin, Chick, Alyssum, and Chloe who hosts the fateful party where Colin and Chloe first meet and fall in love. She is also Nicholas' girlfriend. * Jean-Pulse Heartre is a philosopher and author with whose works Chick becomes obsessed with collecting. He is a fictionalized version of French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, with whom Michelle Vian had an extramarital affair.Dugdale, John (July 31, 2014). \\"How did Boris Vian find time to write L'√©cume des jours?\\" Retrieved March 6, 2018.Day, Charles (October 2016). \\"Froth on the daydream\\" Retrieved March 6, 2018. * Professor Gnawknuckle is a doctor and scientist who diagnoses Chloe's disease. * Father Phigga is the priest who officiates Colin and Chloe's wedding ceremony.

They work as page-boys at numerous weddings, including Colin and Chloe's, and have adopted homosexuality to advance their careers. Despite their steady income, the brothers have ceased to take their work seriously. Themes and symbolism It is widely believed that Chloe's illness is a metaphor for cancer and terminal illness.Aesthetica Magazine. \\"Divergent Portrayal\\" Retrieved February 10, 2018. A possible parallel between Chloe's disease and the chronic heart condition Boris Vian suffered from throughout his life has also been speculated. Colin's copious spending on Chloe's treatment and his relentless job search for more money represent the financial struggle many families face with paying for their loved ones' treatments and medical bills. His desperation to keep his wife alive and his grief and depression after her death symbolize the emotional and psychological anguish faced by individuals who know or have lost someone to terminal illness. Ultimately, Colin's actions and fate at the end of the novel demonstrate that cancer not only devastates the life of the patient ‚Äì it also does the same to the lives of the people surrounding him or her. Meanwhile, Chick's compulsive fixation on Jean-Pulse Heartre is a metaphor for drug addiction. His subsequent neglect of Alyssum and the rapid depletion of his funds on Heartre's works both reflect common characteristics shared among the majority of drug addicts. The physical deterioration of the apartments of Colin, Nicholas, and Chick mirrors the depression and gradual loss of hope brought about by a persistent disease, and Nicholas' sudden ageing represents trauma and stress. Jean-Pulse Heartre is a spoonerism of the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre's name. Throughout the novel, there are references to various works by Sartre, but like the philosopher's name, Boris Vian played with words to make new titles for \\"works\\" by Heartre. For example, sometimes Vian used a synonym, such as Le Vomi (Sartre's original, La Naus√©e), while other times he created titles that served as homonyms to those of original Sartre works, such as La Lettre et le N√©on (The Letter and Neon), a pun on L'√ätre et le N√©ant (Being and Nothingness).

The 43rd Disney animated feature film, it is a science fiction adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 adventure novel Treasure Island and was the first film to be released simultaneously in regular and IMAX theaters. It is at least the second retelling of the story in an outer space setting, following the 1987 Italian miniseries Treasure Island in Outer Space. It employs a novel technique of hand-drawn 2D traditional animation set atop 3D computer animation. With a budget of $140 million, it is the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made. The film was co- written, co-produced and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, who had pitched the concept for the film at the same time that they pitched another Disney animated feature, The Little Mermaid (1989). Treasure Planet features the voices of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brian Murray, David Hyde Pierce, Martin Short, Roscoe Lee Browne, Emma Thompson, Michael Wincott, Laurie Metcalf, and Patrick McGoohan (in his final film role). The musical score was composed by James Newton Howard, while a couple of songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik. Despite generally positive critical reception from most critics and audiences praising the sci-fi visuals, animation, storyline, action scenes, voice performances, and music score, the film performed poorly at the box office, costing $140 million to create while earning $38 million in the United States and Canada and just shy of $110 million worldwide. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards.  Plot  On the planet Montressor, young Jim Hawkins is enchanted by stories of the legendary pirate Captain Nathaniel Flint and his ability to appear from out of nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious \\"Treasure Planet\\". 12 years later, Jim has grown into an aloof and isolated troublemaker due to his father abandoning him and his mother. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from \\"Alponian solar cruising\\": skysurfing atop a rocket-powered sailboard. One day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, Billy Bones, gives Jim a sphere and tells him to \\"beware the cyborg\\". Suddenly, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn to the ground while Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim discovers that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map, leading to the location of Treasure Planet. Despite Sarah's reluctance, Jim and Doppler decide to travel to Treasure Planet in order to gain the funds to rebuild the inn. Doppler commissions the ship RLS Legacy on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined first mate, Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook John Silver, whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship. During the voyage, the ship encounters a supernova and Jim secures lifelines of all crew members. As a black hole forms from the supernova, the ruthless insectoid crew member Scroop secretly cuts Mr. Arrow's lifeline, who is sucked away to his death. The ship manages to ride the shock waves to safety, and the crew mourns the loss of Arrow, suspecting Jim to be responsible. As the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a mutiny erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph prepare to abandon the ship. Jim retrieves the map and Silver targets him, but hesitates, allowing him to escape with the others. The group are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia, and they discover that the map was actually Morph in disguise. While exploring Treasure Planet's forests, they soon meet B.E.N., an abandoned navigational robot who has lost his primary memory and invites them to his home for shelter. The pirates corner the group there; using a secret passage, Jim, Morph, and B.E.N. hijack a longboat to fly back to the Legacy in an attempt to retrieve the map. Scroop, who is guarding the ship, becomes aware of their presence and attacks. When the artificial gravity is disabled during the struggle, Scroop attempts to cut Jim loose of the ship, but Jim succeeds in kicking him overboard. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver and his crew, who have already captured Doppler and Amelia. Silver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens into any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really an ancient machine that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty- handed, Silver attempts to escape on Flint's ship loaded with treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim's life. The survivors escape to the ship, but it gets damaged and is unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to the Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the destruction. Jim finds Silver below decks about to escape his impending judgment. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him a handful of the treasure he managed to save to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will \\"rattle the stars\\". Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim has become an interstellar cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.

Production   Development  Treasure Planet took roughly four and a half years to create, but the concept for Treasure Planet (which was called Treasure Island in Space at the time) was originally pitched by Ron Clements in 1985 at the \\"Gong Show\\" meeting wherein he and John Musker also pitched The Little Mermaid. The pitch was rejected by Michael Eisner, who knew Paramount Pictures was developing a Star Trek sequel with a Treasure Island angle (which eventually went unproduced). The idea was pitched again in 1989 following the release of The Little Mermaid, but the studio still expressed disinterest. Following the release of Aladdin, the idea was pitched for a third time, but Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was the chief of Walt Disney Studios at the time, \\"just wasn't interested\\" in the idea. Angered at the rejection, Clements and Musker approached Feature Animation chairman Roy E. Disney who backed the filmmakers and made his wishes known to Eisner, who in turn agreed that the studio should produce the movie. In 1995, their contract was re-negotiated to allow them to commence development on Treasure Planet when Hercules reached completion. Since Musker and Clements wanted to be able to move \\"the camera around a lot like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron,\\" the delay in production was beneficial since \\"the technology had time to develop in terms of really moving the camera.\\" Principal animation for the film began in 2000 with roughly 350 crew members working on it. In 2002, Roy Conli estimated that there were around 1,027 crew members listed in the screen credits with \\"about four hundred artists and computer artists, about a hundred and fifty musicians and another two hundred technologists\\". According to Conli, Clements wanted to create a space world that was \\"warm and had more life to it than you would normally think of in a science fiction film\\", as opposed to the \\"stainless steel, blue, smoke coming from the bowels of heavily pipe laden\\" treatment of science fiction. In order to make the film \\"fun\\" by creating more exciting action sequences and because they believed that having the characters wear space suits and helmets \\"would take all the romance out of it\\", the crew created the concept of the \\"Etherium,\\" an \\"outer space filled with atmosphere\\". Several changes were made late in the production to the film. The prologue of the film originally featured an adult Jim Hawkins narrating the story of Captain Flint in first person, but the crew considered this to be too \\"dark\\" and felt that it lacked character involvement. The crew also intended for the film to include a sequence showing Jim working on his solar surfer and interacting with an alien child, which was intended to show Jim's more sensitive side and as homage to The Catcher in the Rye. Because of the intention to begin the film with a scene of Jim solar surfing, the sequence had to be cut.  Writing  Writer Rob Edwards stated that \\"it was extremely challenging\\" to take a classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away with some of the science fiction elements (\\"things like the metal space ships and the coldness\\") early on. Edwards goes on to say that they \\"did a lot of things to make the film more modern\\" and that the idea behind setting the film in outer space was to \\"make the story as exciting for kids now as the book was for kids then\\". With regard to adapting the characters from the book to film, Ron Clements mentioned that the Jim Hawkins in the book is \\"a very smart, very capable kid\\", but they wanted to make Jim start out as \\"a little troubled kid\\" who \\"doesn't really know who he is\\" while retaining the aforementioned characteristics from the original character. The \\"mentor figures\\" for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as \\"one is more comic and the other's very straight\\"; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler. Clements also mentions that though the father-son relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver was present \\"to some degree\\" in the book, they wanted to emphasize it more in the film. Terry Rossio, who worked on the script, later argued the filmmakers made a crucial mistake turning Jim Hawkins into an adolescent. \\"Treasure Island, the book, is a boy's adventure, about a young cabin boy who matches wits with a crew of bloodthirsty pirates. All of the key scenes are made more dramatic by the fact that it's a young kid who is in danger... Treasure Planet made the kid into a young man. Which dilutes the drama of all the situations, start to finish... Instead of being an amazing and impressive kid, he became a petulant unimpressive teen.\\"  Casting  Casting director Ruth Lambert held a series of casting auditions for the film in New York, Los Angeles, and London, but the crew already had some actors in mind for two of the major characters. The character of Dr. Doppler was written with David Hyde Pierce in mind, and Pierce was given a copy of the Treasure Planet script along with preliminary sketches of the character and the film's scenic elements while he was working on Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998). He stated that \\"the script was fantastic, the look was so compelling\\" that he accepted the role. Likewise, the character of Captain Amelia was developed with the idea that Emma Thompson would be providing her voice. \\"We offered it to her and she was really excited,\\" Clements said. Musker said, \\"This is the first action adventure character that Emma has ever played and she was pregnant during several of the sessions. She was happy that she could do all this action and not have to train for the part\\" There were no actors initially in mind for the characters of John Silver and Jim Hawkins; Brian Murray (John Silver) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins) were signed after months of auditions. Gordon-Levitt stated that he was attracted to the role because \\"it's a Disney animated movie and Disney animated movies are in a class by themselves,\\" and that \\"to be part of that tradition is unbelievable to me\\". Musker mentioned that Gordon-Levitt \\"combined enough vulnerability and intelligence and a combination of youthfulness but incompleteness\\" and that they liked his approach. Among the lead actors, only Pierce had experience with voice acting prior to the making of Treasure Planet. Conli explained that they were looking for \\"really the natural voice of the actor\\", and that sometimes it was better to have an actor with no experience with voice work as he utilizes his natural voice instead of \\"affecting a voice\\". The voice sessions were mostly done without any interaction with the other actors, but Gordon-Levitt expressed a desire to interact with Murray because he found it difficult to act out most of the scenes between Jim Hawkins and John Silver alone.  Design  An illustration by N.C. Wyeth titled One More Step, Mr. Hands for a 1911 publication of Treasure Island. This type of illustration, which was described by the film crew as \\"classic storybook illustration,\\" was the basis for Treasure Planet's overall look. While designing for Treasure Planet, the crew operated on rule they call the \\"70/30 Law\\" (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi. The overall look of Treasure Planet was based on the art style promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration (such as Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth), whose illustrations have been described by the film's crew as being the \\"classic storybook illustration,\\" having a painterly feel to it, and being composed of a warm color palette. There were around forty animators on the crew, and were further divided into teams; for example, sixteen animators were assigned to Jim Hawkins because he appeared on the screen the most, and twelve were assigned to John Silver. To ensure \\"solidity\\" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well. When asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of Treasure Island for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to \\"clear his mind of stereotypes\\", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor Wallace Beery, whom he \\"loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.\\" For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because \\"there was a whole attitude, a posture\\" wherein \\"you felt the pain and the youthful innocence\\", and he also cited the film Braveheart because \\"there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.\\" Animators also used maquettes, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was Pinocchio (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be \\"like a mannequin in a store\\", but rather has to be \\"something that tells you [the character's] personality\\" and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles. The animators took Deep Canvas, a technology which they had initially developed for Tarzan (1999), and came up with a process they called \\"Virtual Sets,\\" wherein they created entire 360 degree sets before they began staging the scenes. They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a \\"painted image with depth perception\\" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film. In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of Captain Hook from Peter Pan (1953) and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.  Animation  One of the film's goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point you could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the Treasure Planet, there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film. The traditional 2D character animation that Disney is known for, three-dimensional character animation, and the computer-generated or CG environments. Audio This \\"70/30 Law\\" of \\"70% traditional and 30% sci-fi\\" was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team \\"scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms\\" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to \\"avoid sounding slick or sci-fi\\". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried \\"affected his comedy\\", and \\"the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances\\". The music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (\\"I'm Still Here\\" and \\"Always Know Where You Are\\") from The Goo Goo Dolls frontman John Rzeznik and British pop-rock group, BBMak. Both songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik in the film, but BBMak recorded \\"Always Know Where You Are\\" for the soundtrack. The score was composed by James Newton Howard, who said that the score is \\"very much in the wonderful tradition of Korngold and Tiomkin and Steiner.\\" The score has been described as a mixture of modern \\"classical style\\" music in the spirit of Star Wars and Celtic music. Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser is credited as the co-composer of the track \\"Silver Leaves\\", and is also listed as a soloist in the film's credits. Walt Disney Records released the film's soundtrack album on November 19, 2002.  Marketing  Prior to and during its theatrical run, Treasure Planet had promotional support from McDonald's, Pepsi-Cola, Dreyer's, and Kellogg Company. McDonald's included promotional items such as action figures and puzzles in their Happy Meals and Mighty Meals, Pepsi-Cola placed promotional film graphics onto the packaging of a number of their soft drinks (Mountain Dew, Code Red Sierra Mist, Mug Root Beer, Orange Slice, and Lipton Brisk), Dreyer's used their delivery truck panels to promote ice cream flavors inspired by the film (such as \\"Galactic Chocolate\\" and \\"Vanilla Treasure\\"), and Kellog included film-branded spoons in their cereal boxes. Hasbro also released a lineup of Treasure Planet action figures and toys. A novelization was written by Kiki Thorpe and was published by Puffin Books.  Release  Treasure Planet held its world premiere at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood on November 17, 2002, though it was also screened in Paris, France on November 6, 2002. The film is \\"the first major studio feature\\" to be released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously; this was done in the light of the success of Disney films that were re-released in IMAX format, such as Fantasia 2000 and Beauty and the Beast. Dick Cook, then- chairman of Walt Disney Studios, also mentioned that the simultaneous release was a good way to distinguish themselves during the competitive holiday season. Home media Treasure Planet was released in DVD and VHS format in the United States and Canada on April 29, 2003. The DVD includes behind-the- scenes featurettes, a visual commentary, deleted scenes, teaser and theatrical trailers, the music video for the song \\"I'm Still Here\\" by John Rzeznik, and a virtual tour of the RLS Legacy. The DVD retained the number one spot in Billboard's top sales for two weeks and the VHS was number one in sales for three weeks. By July 2003, Treasure Planet brought in $64 million in DVD sales. Disney released a 10th Anniversary special edition Blu-ray/DVD combo on July 3, 2012.  Reception  Box office Treasure Planet grossed over $12 million on its debut weekend, ranking at fourth place behind Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Die Another Day, and Disney's own The Santa Clause 2. The film ended up grossing $38.1 million domestically and $71.4 million internationally for a $109.5 million worldwide gross. Its failure became apparent early on, as Disney's Buena Vista Distribution arm reduced its fourth-quarter earnings by $47 million within a few days of the film's release. In 2014, the Los Angeles Times listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time. Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 69% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 6.51/10. The site's critics consensus states \\"Though its characterizations are weaker than usual, Treasure Planet offers a fast-paced, beautifully rendered vision of outer space.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 30 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post, who gave it 4 stars out of 5, stated that the film \\"boasts the purest of Disney raptures: It unites the generations, rather than driving them apart\\". Leah Rozen of People stated that the film \\"has imagination, humor aplenty and moves briskly\\", and that \\"the animation, combining traditional and digital techniques, is ravishing.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said that the film's most noteworthy feature is \\"the artful way it combines the futuristic and the retro\\", and went on to say that the film doesn't have the \\"charm of Lilo & Stitch\\" nor the \\"dazzling artistry of Spirited Away\\", but concluded that Treasure Planet is \\"a capable and diverting holiday season adventure for a family audience.\\" Kim Hollis of Box Office Prophets stated that \\"there's plenty to recommend the film ‚Äì the spectacular visuals alone make Treasure Planet a worthwhile watch,\\" though expressing disappointment because she felt that the characters were \\"not all that creatively rendered\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 2.5 stars out of 4; he felt that a more traditional take on the story would have been \\"more exciting\\" and \\"less gimmicky\\". Andy Klein of Daily Variety Gotham complained about the script, describing it as \\"listless\\" and remarked, \\"If only its script were as amusing as its visuals.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \\"less an act of homage than a clumsy and cynical bit of piracy\\", and went on to say that it is \\"not much of a movie at all\\" and a \\"brainless, mechanical picture\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as \\"all cutesy updated fripperies and zero momentum.\\" Awards The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Spirited Away (2001). It was also nominated for a number of Annie Awards.Outstanding Character Animation, Outstanding Character Design in an Animated Feature Production, Outstanding Directing in an Animated Feature Production, Outstanding Effects Animation, Outstanding Production Design in an Animated Feature Production, Outstanding Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production, and Outstanding Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production - Canceled franchise Before Treasure Planet premiered in cinemas, Thomas Schumacher, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, mentioned the possibilities of having direct-to-video releases for Treasure Planet as well as a television series. He stated that they already had \\"a story and some storyboards and concepts up and a script for what a sequel to [Treasure Planet] could be,\\" and that they also had a \\"notion\\" of what the series would be. Director Jun Falkenstein and screenwriter Evan Spiliotopoulos began early development on Treasure Planet 2. In the sequel, Jim Hawkins and Kate, his love interest and classmate at the Royal Interstellar Academy, must team with Long John Silver to stop the villainous Ironbeard from freeing the inmates of Botany Bay Prison Asteroid. Willem Dafoe was set to voice Ironbeard. The sequel was canceled when Treasure Planet disappointed at the box office.  Video games  Several Treasure Planet video games were released. Disney Interactive released the naval strategy game Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon for the PC in October 2002, while Sony Computer Entertainment released a Treasure Planet action video game for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 in November, developed by Bizarre Creations. The company used Softimage's XSI engine for modeling, texturing and animation, and released a Making-of video on their Facebook page in 2008. A Game Boy Advance game based on the film was also released. A series of games collectively called Disney's Treasure Planet: Training Academy (or Disney's Treasure Planet CollectionDisney's Treasure Planet Collection Mobygames) was also released in 2002. It was composed of three games (Broadside Blast, Treasure Racer, and Etherium Rescue), and players with all three games could unlock a fourth game (Ship Shape).  Reception  The game was met with mixed to negative reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 66.43% and 68 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 64% and 61 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; and 57.14% and 44 out of 100 for the PlayStation version.

The haloarene are different from haloalkanes because they exhibit many differences in methods of preparation and properties. The most important members are the aryl chlorides, but the class of compounds is so broad that many derivatives enjoy niche applications. Preparation The two main preparatory routes to aryl halides are direct halogenation and via diazonium salts. Direct halogenation In the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, Lewis acids serve as catalysts. Many metal chlorides are used, examples include iron(III) chloride or aluminium chloride. The most important aryl halide, chlorobenzene is produced by this route. Monochlorination of benzene is always accompanied by formation of the dichlorobenzene derivatives. Arenes with electron donating groups react with halogens even in the absence of Lewis acids. For example, phenols and anilines react quickly with chlorine and bromine water to give multiple halogenated products.Illustrative procedure for chlorination of an aromatic compound: The decolouration of bromine water by electron-rich arenes is used in the bromine test. Direct halogenation of arenes are possible in the presence of light or at high temperature. For alkylbenzene derivatives, the alkyl positions tend to be halogenated first in the free radical halogenation. To halogenate the ring, Lewis acids are required, and light should be excluded to avoid the competing reaction. Reaction between benzene and halogen to form an halogenobenzene Sandmeyer, Balz-Schiemann and Gattermann reactions The second main route is the Sandmeyer reaction. Anilines (aryl amines) are converted to their diazonium salts using nitrous acid. For example, copper(I) chloride converts diazonium salts to the aryl chloride. Nitrogen gas is the leaving group, which makes this reaction very favorable. The similar Schiemann reaction uses the tetrafluoroborate anion as the fluoride donor. Gatterman reaction can also be used to convert diazonium salt to chlorobenzene or bromobenzene by using copper powder instead of copper chloride or copper bromide. But this must be done in the presence of HCl and HBr respectively. Halogenation in nature Aryl halides occur widely in nature, most commonly produced by marine organisms that utilize the chloride and bromide in ocean waters. Chlorinated and brominated aromatic compounds are also numerous, e.g. derivatives of tyrosine, tryptophan, and various pyrrole derivatives. Some of these naturally occurring aryl halides exhibit useful medicinal properties. Vancomycin, an important antibiotic, is an aryl chloride isolated from soil fungi. The chemical structure of 6,6‚Ä≤-dibromoindigo, the main component of Tyrian Purple. Structural trends The C-X distances for aryl halides follow the expected trend. These distances for fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and methyl 4-iodobenzoate are 135.6(4), 173.90(23), 189.8(1), and 209.9 pm, respectively. Reactions Substitution Unlike typical alkyl halides, aryl halides do not participate in conventional SN2 reactions, as the backside attack required for an SN2 reaction is impossible, owing to the planar structure of the aryl group. SN1 reactions are theoretically possible, but not generally observed, as the formation of the aryl cation is not energetically favourable. However, aryl halides with electron-withdrawing groups in the ortho and para positions, can undergo SNAr reactions. For example, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene can react with water in basic solution to give a phenol: Nucleophilic aromatic substitution Unlike in most other substitution reactions, fluoride is the best leaving group, and iodide the worst, due to the fluoride's high electronegativity allowing better stabilization of rate-determining transition state that leads to the negatively charged Meisenheimer intermediate. Work in 2016 has proposed that a concerted displacement mechanism (akin to a frontside SN2 displacement) is possible in the case of a fluoride displacement of an activated oxygen leaving group. In this mechanism, the Meisenheimer 'intermediate' is in fact only a transition state, rather than a true intermediate. A 2018 paper indicates that this situation may actually be rather common, occurring in systems that were previously assumed to proceed via SNAr mechanisms. Benzyne Aryl halides are capable of doing reactions via the benzyne mechanism, involving sodium amide in liquid ammonia. For example, chlorobenzene can be converted to aniline under these conditions. center Organometallic reagent formation Aryl halides react with metals, generally lithium or magnesium, to give more reactive derivatives that behave as sources of aryl anions. Direct formation of Grignard reagents, by adding the magnesium to the aryl halide in an ethereal solution, works well if the aromatic ring is not significantly deactivated by electron-withdrawing groups. center Compounds such as para-bromonitrobenzene cannot form stable Grignards directly, as their aromatic rings are too deactivated. If such a Grignard is needed, it's usually made by magnesium-halogen exchange involving isopropyl magnesium chloride at -78 ¬∞C. This reaction takes place because the pKa of the aromatic protons is much lower‚Äîgenerally around 45, while that of the aliphatic alkane exceeds 50. The Grignards made using this procedure are generally used immediately, to avoid decomposition. center Other reactions The halides can be displaced by strong nucleophiles via reactions involving radical anions. Alternatively aryl halides, especially the bromides and iodides, undergo oxidative addition, and thus are subject to Buchwald‚ÄìHartwig amination-type reactions. Chlorobenzene was once the precursor to phenol, which is now made by oxidation of cumene. At high temperatures, aryl groups react with ammonia to give anilines.  Biodegradation  Rhodococcus phenolicus is a bacterium species able to degrade dichlorobenzene as sole carbon sources. Applications The aryl halides produced on the largest scale are chlorobenzene and the isomers of dichlorobenzene. One major but discontinued application was the use of chlorobenzene as a solvent for dispersing the herbicide Lasso. Overall, production of aryl chlorides (also naphthyl derivatives) has been declining since the 1980s, in part due to environmental concerns. Triphenylphosphine is produced from chlorobenzene: :3 C6H5Cl + PCl3 \\\\+ 6 Na ‚Üí P(C6H5)3 \\\\+ 6 NaCl Aryl bromides are widely used as fire-retardants. The most prominent member is tetrabromobisphenol-A, which is prepared by direct bromination of the diphenol.

He was drafted by the Patriots in the eighth round of the 1993 NFL Draft. He played college football at Marshall. On May 11, 2010, Brown was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame. In June 2012, Brown was voted into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame by fan vote. Brown played his entire 15-year career with the Patriots. He earned three Super Bowl rings with the team; he played on five of the 11 Patriots teams to reach the Super Bowl, and he retired as the franchise leader in career receptions. His primary position was at wide receiver, but he also contributed as a return specialist and on defense as a cornerback. Early years Brown attended Blackville-Hilda High School in Blackville, South Carolina. He was discouraged from playing football, as he was thought too small, beginning at 5'6\\", 135 lbs. Still, he lettered in football and track and field. His high school team won a state championship in 1988 with a 14-1 record. College career In college, Brown was a standout wide receiver, punt returner, and kickoff returner for Marshall University, leading the Division I-AA in both kickoff and punt return average in 1991, a year in which he and quarterback Todd Donnan tied a record by combining for a 99-yard pass play against Virginia Military Institute. The following year, Marshall claimed its first national championship with Brown as its primary wide receiver and returner. In the championship game, Brown sealed the win by intercepting a Hail Mary Youngstown State pass in the final seconds of the game. His career kickoff return average (29.69 yards per return) still stands as an NCAA record, as do his four kickoff returns for touchdowns. He scored one touchdown for every eight times he touched the football. In 2006, Brown was given a distinguished alumni award by his alma mater.Distinguished Alumni Marshall University. Accessed July 10, 2007. Professional career Brown was drafted by the Patriots out of Marshall in the eighth round of the 1993 NFL Draft (198th overall). He was waived as a final cut in the 1993 pre- season by head coach Bill Parcells but was re-signed on October 19, 1993. It wasn't until the 1995 season that he started seeing time as a wide receiver, recording 14 catches for 159 yards. The next season in 1996, when the New England Patriots reached the Super Bowl, he recorded 21 catches for 222 yards. In 1997, he recorded 41 catches for 607 yards and 6 touchdowns despite being behind both Terry Glenn and Shawn Jefferson on the depth chart at receiver as well as competing with Ben Coates and Vincent Brisby for catches. In 1998, he resumed his duties as a punt returner. His first year as a starter was 2000, when he recorded 83 catches for 944 yards and 4 touchdowns. In 2001 he, alongside Tom Brady, led the Patriots to their first ever Super Bowl championship, recording 101 catches during the season for 1,199 yards and 5 touchdowns, setting the franchise record for receptions and earning his first and only trip to the Pro Bowl. He also returned 29 punts for 413 yards and 2 touchdowns, giving him a league-leading 14.2 yards per return average. During the AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs that season, Brown returned a crucial punt for a touchdown which provided the winning margin, adding to the two he returned for touchdowns during the regular season. He also scooped up a blocked field goal attempt in that game, and made a lateral pass to teammate Antwan Harris, which completed a second special teams touchdown. In 2002, he recorded 97 receptions for 890 yards and 3 touchdowns. In 2003, he had 40 catches for 472 yards, helping his team back to Super Bowl XXXVIII. In 2004, he had only 17 receptions, but contributed in what was originally an emergency role on defense, ranking second on the team in interceptions with three. He was topped in this category only by Eugene Wilson. Further demonstrating his versatility, during the 2006 preseason he lined up as an emergency quarterback; when questioned as to why Brown had appeared there, the head coach of the Patriots, Bill Belichick, joked that he had lined Brown up there \\"to develop his legend\\". Brown was released by the Patriots on March 1, 2005 for salary cap reasons, but he signed a new contract with them on May 23, 2005. He signed despite a better financial deal from the New Orleans Saints. In the 2005 season, he recorded 39 receptions for 466 yards. On July 17, 2007, Brown reached an agreement with the New England Patriots for a 15th season, making him the second longest- playing Patriot at the time behind Steve Grogan; both have since been surpassed by Tom Brady.\\"Tom Brady is Scorching the NFL and Setting Records Just Two Games Into the Season\\" On July 28, he was placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, but was activated on November 27. In addition to playing offense and defense with success, Brown is the Patriots' all-time leading punt returner with 252 returns for 2,625 yards and 3 touchdowns. He is second all-time in Patriots history in receptions (557) and third all-time in receiving yards (6,366). He still holds the Super Bowl record for most punt returns in a career with 8. Brown is the only player in NFL history with at least 550 receptions, 250 punt returns, and an interception. 2006 AFC divisional playoffs A memorable moment for Brown came in a 2006 AFC Divisional Playoff game, when the Patriots met the favored San Diego Chargers. With 5 minutes left in the game, the Patriots were down 21-13 and facing 4th and 5. Tom Brady threw his third interception of the game, to the Chargers' Marlon McCree. Brown, making what teammate Tedy Bruschi described as a \\"quick mental switch\\" from offensive to defensive player, instinctively ripped the ball out of McCree's grasp. The fumble was subsequently recovered by the Patriots Reche Caldwell, giving them a new set of downs. New England went on to tie the score with a touchdown and a two-point conversion, and then won the game on a 31-yard field goal. Brown also caught 5 passes for 39 yards in the game. Legacy Brown is a fan favorite among many Patriots fans due to his style of play and years of dedication to his team. His punt return in the 2001 AFC Championship along with numerous big plays throughout his Patriots career culminated in his induction into the Patriots Hall of Fame at Patriots Place. Retirement On March 13, 2008, The Boston Globe reported that the Patriots would not offer Brown a contract for the 2008 season. On September 25, 2008, Brown officially retired from professional football during a press conference alongside Patriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick. He finished his playing career as the all-time leader for the New England Patriots in receptions with 557. On June 4, 2012, it was announced that Brown was elected to the Patriots Hall of Fame by fan vote, beating out former head coach Bill Parcells and safety Fred Marion. Coaching At the beginning of the 2019 NFL season, he began coaching in an unofficial capacity with the New England Patriots, assisting wide receivers coach Joe Judge, who was often busy with his other role as special teams coordinator. In addition in 2016 he was a part of the Bill Walsh Minority Coaching Fellowship working with the Patriots. In 2020 it was officially announced that Brown was on the Patriots coaching staff. He would be serving as the teams running backs/kick returners coach. Post-playing career Entertainment Since 2008, Brown has been a football analyst with NBC Sports Boston.Brown, along with teammate Tom Brady, played himself on the Family Guy episode \\"Patriot Games\\". He also had a cameo in the 2012 film The Three Stooges. Business Brown is an investor in and spokesman for the Narragansett Brewing Company. Personal Brown currently resides in Huntington, West Virginia, where a portion of West Virginia Route 10 was designated Troy Brown Way. Brown and his wife, Kimberly (who works as a chemist for the United States Army Corps of Engineers), have three sons, Sir'mon, Saanjay, and one unknown.New England Patriots bio He works with various charities through the Troy Brown Fantasy Football Camp. He also worked with the Bartrum Brown Football Camp from 2001 through 2011.

In principle, these tests were distinct from any political decision to join. The five tests were as follows:HM Treasury - GOVERNMENT POLICY ON EMU AND THE FIVE ECONOMIC TESTS #Are business cycles and economic structures compatible so that we and others could live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis? #If problems emerge is there sufficient flexibility to deal with them? #Would joining EMU create better conditions for firms making long-term decisions to invest in Britain? #What impact would entry into EMU have on the competitive position of the UK's financial services industry, particularly the City's wholesale markets? #In summary, will joining EMU promote higher growth, stability and a lasting increase in jobs? In addition to these self-imposed criteria the UK would also have had to have met the European Union's economic convergence criteria (\\"Maastricht criteria\\") before being allowed to adopt the euro. One criterion is two years' membership of ERM II, of which the UK was never a member. Under the Maastricht Treaty, the UK was not obliged to adopt the euro. When the Brown government was voted out of office in the 2010 United Kingdom general election, the tests ceased to be government policy. History of the tests The five tests were designed in 1997 by former British Labour Party Chancellor Gordon Brown and his then special adviser Ed Balls, which is often claimed to have been developed in the back of a taxi while Brown was in the United States, though this has later been discredited. Despite this uncertain pedigree, the International Monetary Fund deemed them to be \\"broadly consistent with the economic considerations that are relevant for assessing entry into a monetary union.\\"International Monetary Fund - United Kingdom: 2001 IMF Article IV Consultation; Concluding Statement of the Mission December 11, 2001 The UK Treasury is responsible for assessing the tests. It first did so in October 1997, when it was decided that the UK economy was neither sufficiently converged with that of the rest of the EU, nor sufficiently flexible, to justify a recommendation of membership at that time. The government pledged to reassess the tests early in the next Parliament (which began in June 2001), and published a revised assessment of the five tests in June 2003. This assessment ran to around 250 pages and was backed up by eighteen supporting studies, on subjects such as housing, labour market flexibility, and the euro area's monetary and fiscal frameworks. The conclusions were broadly similar; the Treasury argued that: # There had been significant progress on convergence since 1997, but there remained some significant structural differences, such as in the housing market. # While UK flexibility had improved, they could not be confident that it is sufficient. # Euro membership would increase investment, but only if convergence and flexibility were sufficient. # The City of London, Britain's financial centre, would benefit from Eurozone membership. # Growth, stability and employment would increase as a result of euro membership, but only if convergence and flexibility were sufficient. On the basis of this assessment, in May-June 2003, the government ruled out UK membership of the euro for the duration of the Parliament. Since Labour was re-elected in 2005, the debate on the European Constitution and subsequent Treaty of Lisbon upstaged that on the euro. Gordon Brown, in his first press conference as British Prime Minister (2007), ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.Times online - Puritanism comes too naturally for 'Huck' Brown However, in late 2008, Jos√© Manuel Barroso (the European Commission President) stated differently; that UK leaders were seriously considering the switch amidst the financial crisis.EUobserver - Britain closer to euro, Barroso says Brown later denied this.AFP - Britain says no change on euro after EU chief's claim One of the underlying issues that stand in the way of monetary union is the structural difference between the UK housing market and those of many continental European countries. Although home ownership in Britain is near the European average, variable rate mortgages are more common, making the retail price index in Britain more influenced by interest rate changes.MacLennan, D., Muellbauer, J. and Stephens, M.

In the years prior to the fall of the Somoza regime, Pastora was the leader of the Southern Front, the largest militia in southern Nicaragua, second only to the FSLN (Sandinista National Liberation Front) in the north. Pastora was nicknamed Comandante Cero (\\"Commander Zero\\"). His group was the first to call itself \\"Sandinistas\\", and was also the first to accept an alliance with the FSLN, the group that was to become more popularly identified by the name. At the end of 1982, a few years after the revolutionary victory, Pastora became disillusioned with the government of the FSLN, and formed the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance (ARDE) with the object of confronting the \\"pseudo-Sandinistas\\" politically and militarily.Latin American regional reports: Caribbean & Central America report: Volume 93, 1993. As of 2010, he was reconciled with the FSLN and held a ministerial post in the government of Daniel Ortega. His role in a border dispute with Costa Rica and allegations of environmental damage to territory claimed by that country led to legal indictment by the government of Costa Rica. Sandinista Ed√©n Pastora on August 25, 1978, boarding a Venezuelan C-130 with 19 operatives, five hostages and 80 released political prisoners Pastora was born in Ciudad Dar√≠o. When he was seven, Pastora's father was killed in a boundary dispute. While in high school with the Jesuits in Granada, he first learned about Augusto C√©sar Sandino through his Panamanian history teacher. He began his rebel career when he decided that the government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle was corrupt and formed the southern Nicaraguan ARDE from local peasant farmers (called campesinos) and aboriginal tribes living according to more traditional ways. Pastora allied himself with the FSLN in the mid-1960s. He became a rebel guerrilla and was the mastermind behind the August 1978 standoff in the Nicaraguan National Palace, in which he and 19 FSLN commandos disguised as members of Somoza's National Guard stormed the Palace, disarming or killing the real Nicaraguan National Guard members. Among the hostages taken were members of the Nicaraguan Congress, which was in session at the time of the attack, and Somoza's half brother, Jos√© Somoza.Meade, Teresa A. A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present, 2010, pg. 284. Members of the commando used numbers as codenames, with Pastora as Zero, and Dora Maria Tellez as Commander \\"two\\" leading to a lasting identification of Eden as Comandante Cero and Dora Maria as Commander \\"two.\\"Wikisource The operation infuriated Somoza and was considered one of the turning points in the insurgency. Originally organized to free FSLN members imprisoned by the regime -- among the prisoners being Daniel Ortega and Tomas Borge -- the raid marked an uncontested victory for the FSLN. After negotiating a USD $500,000 deal with Somoza and Cardinal Miguel Obando, Pastora, Ortega and other released prisoners left for Cuba, where he claimed to have been a \\"prisoner\\" lavished with women and luxury, but not allowed to leave the country until Mart√≠n Torrijos, the son of then Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos and Pastora's personal friend, voiced his concern and went to Cuba to rescue him personally.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Guide to Hispanic Heritage Pastora was put in command of the FSLN's Southern Front, advancing on the town of Rivas from bases in Costa Rica. In reaction to Pastora's widely held reputation, Somoza sent his best troops against him and as a consequence the Southern Front made little headway while suffering heavy casualties. However, the Southern Front contributed to the Sandinista victory by tying down over 2,000 heavily equipped Nicaraguan National Guard forces, as Somoza remained fixated on stopping Pastora, even as major cities fell to the rebels. Contra Pastora became disenchanted with the turn of the revolution when most of the Sandinista leaders moved to the luxury residences of Managua; he felt the leadership was doing too little to benefit the campesinos and aboriginal tribes he represented and was overly concerned with propagating ideological consistency in a poorly concealed bid to consolidate Ortega's political power. Consequently, Pastora turned against the Sandinista regime to fight against it. He once again began military operations in southern Nicaragua, loosely federated with northern forces which, composed mostly of highly paid former National Guard members and some Miskito Indians, were collectively referred to as the Contras. From a military standpoint, Pastora's efforts contributed much less than did forces in the north. Pastora also received less support from the US government; whether his performance was a result or cause of this disparity is subject to debate. Military achievements aside, the presence of Pastora, a former FSLN revolutionary hero, among the Contras, helped the public image of the Contras abroad and provided a sort of public-relations counterweight to the bad reputation accorded to the FDN faction (mostly led by ex-National- Guard \\"Somocistas\\"). However, Pastora soon lost whatever popularity he might have had among common Nicaraguans as he adopted the strategy of the northern Contras, committing human rights abuses while mostly avoiding direct encounters with the Nicaraguan military.\\"With the Contras: a reporter in the wilds of Nicaragua\\" By Christopher Dickey, 1987\\"Nicaragua von Innen\\", by G√ºnther Wallraff, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and others, konkret Literatur Verlag, 1983 In 1984, Pastora was apparently the intended target of the La Penca bombing, which killed four people at a press conference he was holding. He was seriously wounded. Pastora became disillusioned with Nicaragua and became a refugee in Costa Rica during the 1990s, where he became a citizen. Later, however, he returned to Nicaragua.Winners and losers in Nicaragua‚Äôs ‚ÄòGrand Canal‚Äô project The Tico Times, January 8, 2012. Later years Pastora since opened a shark fishing business in San Juan del Norte on the San Juan River along the border with Costa Rica.Arghiris, Richard, and Richard Leonardi. Nicaragua, 2008, pg. 187. He was seen at a Sandinista demonstration over the slow certification of winners in the November 5, 2000 municipal elections. Alvaro Pardo made a documentary about Pastora in 2006 called Ed√©n Pastora - Commandante Cero. It portrays Pastora's return to the political arena of Nicaragua when he was nominated as a candidate for the mayor of Managua. Pastora ran for president in the general election of 2006. He finished in fifth place, with 0.29% of the vote.Escrutinio - Elecciones Nacionales 2006 In 2008, Pastora announced that he had become reconciled with the current FSLN and pledged support for the government of Daniel Ortega. He is quoted as saying, \\"this government is making a revolution, one-eyed or lame, but it is a revolution.\\" (In Spanish.) \\"...este gobierno est√° haciendo una revoluci√≥n, tuerta o renca, pero es una revoluci√≥n y Daniel, Bayardo (Arce), Tomas (Borge), pueden ser malos, pero son revolucionarios y son mejores que los otros.\\" As of 2010, he held the title of Minister of Development of the Rio San Juan Basin. (In Spanish.) In November 2010, in perhaps the most publicized Costa Rican arrest warrant issued in years, prosecutors in northern Caribbean canton of Pococ√≠ announced that Pastora, now 73 years old, had been indicted for severe environmental damage caused in the eastern Lim√≥n province near the R√≠o San Juan that the Republic of Nicaragua claims to be a part of their territory. In a taunt taken at face value by many in the international media, Pastora (and the Nicaraguan Government) based his arguments not on official maps but on faulty border information obtained from Google Maps. Pastora and his soldiers invaded the Caleros Island in order to create a channel connecting the San Juan River with the Atlantic Ocean. The government of Costa Rica, which disputes ownership of the island with Nicaragua, holds that this has caused irreparable ecological destruction. In April 2015 photos show the now 78-year-old Pastora watching as the canal that provoked the international incident was filled with sand. He is well above the ground watching from a ladder lashed to trees. Personal life and death Pastora had three failed marriages. Lamenting about the interpersonal strains that occur in the life of a revolutionary, Pastora said: \\"The first thing we revolutionaries lose is our wives. The last thing we lose is our lives. In between our women and our lives, we lose our freedom, our happiness, our means of living.\\" Pastora died at a military hospital in Managua on June 16, 2020, at the age of 83. The cause of death was reported variously as either respiratory failure or a heart attack. While hospitalized, Pastora was also treated for symptoms of COVID-19, although his grandson said he was not tested for the coronavirus.

She was the leader of the Yugoslav United Left (JUL) which governed in coalition with Milo≈°eviƒá's Socialist Party of Serbia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. She was reported to have huge influence over her husband and was increasingly seen as the power behind the throne. Among her opponents, she was known as The Red Witch and the Lady Macbeth of Belgrade. Markoviƒá was accused of abuse of office, inciting several associates to allocate a state- owned apartment for her grandson‚Äôs nanny in September 2000. She was indicted in December 2002 and fled Belgrade on 23 February 2003. In June 2018, she was declared guilty in absentia by a court in Belgrade, and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, but the verdict was overturned on appeal in March 2019. Markoviƒá lived under political asylum in Russia from February 2003 until her death on 14 April 2019 in Moscow. Life Early life Markoviƒá was the daughter of Moma Markoviƒá and Vera Miletiƒá, who were both fighting for the Yugoslav Partisans at the time of her birth. Her aunt was Davorjanka Paunoviƒá, private secretary and alleged mistress of Josip Broz Tito. Her mother Vera was captured by German troops and allegedly released sensitive information, under torture. She was then executed in the Banjica concentration camp by the Nazis. Markoviƒá met Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá when they were in high school together. They married in 1965. The couple had two children, son Marko and daughter Marija, who founded TV Ko≈°ava in 1998 and was its owner until 5 October 2000. Education and career Markoviƒá held a Ph.D. in Sociology and taught the subject at the University of Belgrade. Later, she became an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. She was considered to be the only person her husband trusted, her influence being considered a source for the increase in Milo≈°eviƒá strong anti-western rhetoric and actions. \\"She invented him\\", Milo≈°eviƒá biographer Slavoljub ƒêukiƒá told the Ottawa Citizen in 1998. \\"There has never been such a powerful woman in the history of Serbia as Mirjana Markovic. And she has been fatal for Serbia.\\" As the leader of her own political party, Yugoslav United Left she held some political influence. Markoviƒá was largely responsible for erecting the Eternal Flame monument, shortly before the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in 2000. She was believed, though not formally accused, of being involved in the murders of her husband's political rivals including the Serbian politician Ivan Stamboliƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá's former mentor, in 2000, and the journalist Slavko ƒÜuruvija the previous year. \\"Milosevic has never had any political ideas of his own\\", Stamboliƒá said in 2000. \\"They‚Äôve all been hers.\\" She wrote a political column in the weekly Serbian magazine Duga during the sequence of wars in the 1990s. Observers read it for any coded messages. In the old Yugoslavia, she once wrote \\"Serbs, Muslims and Croats were able to live side by side\\", though her husband and his associates presided over its destruction. Some sources have said she died in Sochi. Markoviƒá was the author of many books, which were translated and sold in Canada, Russia, China and India. Political views Markoviƒá's political views tended to be hard-line Communist. Although she often claimed that she agreed with her husband on everything, Milo≈°eviƒá seems to have had fewer authoritarian tendencies than Markoviƒá. She claimed also to be a feminist. Markoviƒá reportedly had little respect for the Bosnian Serb leaders. Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj appeared before a court on 18 June 1994 to face charges of breaking microphone cables in Parliament. He read a statement, saying, \\"Mr. Judge, all I can say in my defense is that Milo≈°eviƒá is Serbia's biggest criminal.\\" Markoviƒá replied by calling ≈†e≈°elj a \\"primitive Turk who is afraid to fight like a man, and instead sits around insulting other people's wives.\\" Radovan Karad≈æiƒá was apparently unable to telephone Milo≈°eviƒá because Markoviƒá would not tolerate his calls. Commenting on her husband's arrest to face war crimes charges, Markoviƒá stated: Asylum in Russia and death Pursued by legal authorities, Markoviƒá settled in Russia in 2003. The authorities of Serbia issued an arrest warrant for her on fraud charges which was circulated via Interpol, but the Russian authorities refused to arrest her. In March 2012, a collection of her columns for Pravda from 2007 to 2008, as well as for online portal Sloboda from 2010 to 2011, titled Destierrada e imperdida was published in Belgrade by Treƒái milenijum, a publishing house owned by Had≈æi Dragan Antiƒá. After the 2012 elections, a government minister, Milutin Mrkonjiƒá of the Socialist Party (which he co-founded with Milo≈°eviƒá) said that Markoviƒá and her son were welcome to return. In June 2018, Markoviƒá was found guilty in absentia of real estate fraud charges, and sentenced to a year in prison. The Serbian Appeals Court in March 2019 rejected her conviction, finding it unsound, and ordered a new trial. Markoviƒá underwent several operations, and died in Moscow on 14 April 2019. The New York Times reported her death was caused by complications due to pneumonia. Her body was cremated and interred in Po≈æarevac alongside her husband on 20 April 2019.

It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Rofecoxib was approved in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. Rofecoxib was available by prescription in both tablet-form and as an oral suspension. Rofecoxib gained widespread use among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx. In 2005 the FDA issued a memo concluding that data from large long-term controlled clinical trials do not clearly demonstrate that COX-2 selective agents (including rofecoxib) have a greater risk of serious CV events than non-selective NSAIDs. The FDA reinforced this position in 2015, stating that the available data support a dose and duration dependent class effect of an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events for COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs. In November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. Mode of action Cyclooxygenase (COX) has two well-studied isoforms, called COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for protection of the stomach lining, while COX-2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. By creating \\"selective\\" NSAIDs that inhibit COX-2, but not COX-1, the same pain relief as traditional NSAIDs is offered, but with greatly reduced risk of fatal or debilitating peptic ulcers. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or \\"coxib\\". Though the class of coxibs includes several agents, there are varying degrees of COX-2 selectivity among them, with celecoxib (Celebrex) being the least COX-2 selective, and rofecoxib (Vioxx), valdecoxib (Bextra), and etoricoxib (Arcoxia), being highly COX-2 selective. At the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib approved in the United States with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Pharmacokinetics The therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. Rofecoxib crossed the placenta and blood‚Äìbrain barrier, and took 1‚Äì3 hours to reach peak plasma concentration with an effective half-life (based on steady-state levels) of approximately 17 hours. The metabolic products are cis-dihydro and trans-dihydro derivatives of rofecoxib which are primarily excreted through urine.  Efficacy  Rofecoxib was approved by the FDA to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain.  Premenstrual acne  A 2003 placebo-controlled small short-term study in India of 80 women with premenstrual acne vulgaris acne, were given rofecoxib or placebo for 2 cycles of 10 days suggest that \\"rofecoxib is effective in the management of premenstrual acne. Fabricated efficacy studies On March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., revealed that data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as celecoxib) had been fabricated, overstating the analgesic effects of the drugs. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States). The retracted studies were not submitted to either the FDA or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Drug manufacturer Merck had no comment on the disclosure. Side effects A VIOXX (rofecoxib) sample blister pack. In addition to the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits no effect on bleeding time or platelet aggregation, even at supra-therapeutic doses. Aside from these features, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse effect profile to other NSAIDs. Heart and blood vessels =VIGOR study and publishing controversy= The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of a supra-therapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over a mean duration of 9-months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass). Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \\"is primarily due to\\" this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer's alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \\"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). Months after the preliminary version of VIGOR was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2000, the journal editors learned that certain data reported to the FDA were not included in the NEJM article. Several years later, when they were shown a Merck memo during the depositions for the first federal Vioxx trial, they realized that these data had been available to the authors months before publication. The editors wrote an editorial accusing the authors of deliberately withholding the data. They released the editorial to the media on December 8, 2005, before giving the authors a chance to respond. NEJM editor Gregory Curfman explained that the quick release was due to the imminent presentation of his deposition testimony, which he feared would be misinterpreted in the media. He had earlier denied any relationship between the timing of the editorial and the trial. Although his testimony was not actually used in the December trial, Curfman had testified well before the publication of the editorial. The editors charged that \\"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \\"aspirin not indicated\\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \\"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.\\" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. (Utilizing the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. They further noted that all of the data in the \\"omitted\\" table were printed in the text of the article. The authors stood by the original article. NEJM stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks). Some scientists have accused the NEJM editorial board of making unfounded accusations. Others have applauded the editorial. Renowned research cardiologist Eric Topol, a prominent Merck critic, accused Merck of \\"manipulation of data\\" and said \\"I think now the scientific misconduct trial is really fully backed up\\". Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying \\"this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies\\". On May 15, 2006, the Wall Street Journal reported that a late night email, written by an outside public relations specialist and sent to Journal staffers hours before the Expression of Concern was released, predicted that \\"the rebuke would divert attention to Merck and induce the media to ignore the New England Journal of Medicines own role in aiding Vioxx sales.\\" \\"Internal emails show the New England Journal's expression of concern was timed to divert attention from a deposition in which Executive Editor Gregory Curfman made potentially damaging admissions about the journal's handling of the Vioxx study. In the deposition, part of the Vioxx litigation, Dr. Curfman acknowledged that lax editing might have helped the authors make misleading claims in the article.\\" The Journal stated that NEJMs \\"ambiguous\\" language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; \\"the New England Journal says it didn't attempt to have these mistakes corrected.\\" Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President Edward Scolnick took much of the blame for the suppression of this information.https://web.duke.edu/kenanethics/CaseStudies/Vioxx.pdf The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier. =Alzheimer's disease= In 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart- related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety. =APPROVe study= In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three- year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. An additional aim of the study was to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib. The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including heart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus placebo, the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. In summary, the APPROVe study suggested that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in nearly twice the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo. =Other studies= Pre-approval Phase III clinical trials, like the APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events for the first eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others have pointed out that \\"study 090,\\" a pre-approval trial, showed a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a 7-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another [NSAID]), and an 8-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005). Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia. =Other COX-2 inhibitors= In 2005, the FDA issued a memo concluding that along with the other approved COX-2 selective NSAIDs available at the time (i.e., celecoxib, and valdecoxib), rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of serious adverse CV events compared to placebo. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to CV risk. Only Celebrex (generic name is celecoxib) is still available for purchase in the United States. Regulatory authorities worldwide now require warnings about cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. For example, in 2005, EU regulators required the following changes to the product information and/or packaging of all COX-2 inhibitors: * Contraindications stating that COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and also in patients with peripheral arterial disease * Reinforced warnings to healthcare professionals to exercise caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors to patients with risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking * Given the association between cardiovascular risk and exposure to COX-2 inhibitors, doctors are advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of treatment =Other NSAIDs= Since the withdrawal of Vioxx it has come to light that there may be negative cardiovascular effects with not only other COX-2 inhibitiors, but even the majority of other NSAIDs. It is only with the recent development of drugs like Vioxx that drug companies have carried out the kind of well executed trials that could establish such effects and these sort of trials have never been carried out in older \\"trusted\\" NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and others. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti- platelet aggregation properties. Analyses in 2011 and 2013 by McGettigan and the Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists (CNT) Collaborators, respectively, demonstrated that the risk of serious CV events was a dose dependent effect of COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, with the possible exception of naproxen, and high therapeutic doses of nonselective NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen 2400 mg/day, diclofenac 150 mg/day) carried similar CV risk when compared to a combined group of therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of COX-2 selective NSAIDs (such as rofecoxib). In 2014, Patrono and Baigent, summarizing all of the currently available data in a review article in Circulation, concluded that with the exception of GI toxicity, neither the efficacy nor the major cardiorenal complications of COX-2 selective NSAIDs appear to be influenced by their level of COX-2 selectivity. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration. This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen. Withdrawal Due to the findings of its own APPROVe study, Merck publicly announced its voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market worldwide on September 30, 2004. In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). One FDA analyst estimated that, based upon his mathematical model, Vioxx may have caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market. Senior FDA officials were quick to note, however, that this estimate was based solely on a mathematical model, and must be interpreted with caution. On November 5, 2004, the medical journal The Lancet published a meta-analysis of the available studies on the safety of rofecoxib (J√ºni et al., 2004). The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. Merck responded by issuing a rebuttal of the J√ºni et al. meta-analysis that noted that J√ºni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk.Merck & Co., 2004 Merck-sponsored \\"Martin Report\\", 2006 In 2005, Merck spent $21 million US to retain John S. Martin Jr., a former US District Judge for the Southern District of New York, and colleagues at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. The report, which Merck called the \\"Martin Report\\", was published in February 2006. The report found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. The report that was filed gave a timeline of the events surrounding Vioxx and stated that Merck intended to operate honestly throughout the process. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report it had commissioned, and promised to consider the recommendations. The report was criticised in the press as self-serving. Merck insisted that the report was independent and Merck \\"had no effect at all on the findings and the conclusions\\". Merck hoped that the report would improve public perception of Merck. FDA position In 2005, advisory panels in both the US and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that Rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be no worse than those from ibuprofen‚Äîthough the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. Following the 2005 FDA Advisory Committee, the FDA issued a memo concluding that data from large long-term controlled clinical trials do not clearly demonstrate that COX-2 selective agents (including rofecoxib) have a greater risk of serious cardiovascular events than non-selective NSAIDs. In 2015, the FDA reinforced this conclusion, stating that the available data support a dose and duration dependent class effect of an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events for COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs. Litigation By March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. The first wrongful death trial, Rogers v. Merck, was scheduled in Alabama in the spring of 2005, but was postponed after Merck argued that the plaintiff had falsified evidence of rofecoxib use. On August 19, 2005, a jury in Texas voted 10-2 to hold Merck liable for the death of Robert Ernst, a 59-year-old man who allegedly died of a rofecoxib-induced heart attack. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The jury awarded Carol Ernst, widow of Robert Ernst, $253.4 million in damages. This award was capped at no more than US$26.1 million because of punitive damages limits under Texas law. Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008. On November 3, 2005, Merck won the second case Humeston v. Merck, a personal injury case, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. The first federal trial on rofecoxib, Plunkett v. Merck, began on November 29, 2005 in Houston. The trial ended on December 12, 2005 when Judge Eldon E. Fallon of U.S. District Court declared a mistrial because of a hung jury with an eight to one majority, favoring the defense. Upon retrial in February 2006 in New Orleans, where the Vioxx multidistrict litigation (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the NEJM editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study. On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The judge said that Boyd failed to prove the drug caused his stomach pain and internal bleeding. In January 2006, Garza v. Merck began trial in Rio Grande City, Texas. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 21, 2006 the jury awarded the plaintiff $7 million compensatory and $25 million punitive. The Texas state court of appeals in San Antonio later ruled Garza's fatal heart attack probably resulted from pre-existing health conditions unrelated to his taking of Vioxx, thus reversing the $32 million jury award. On April 5, 2006, a jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck's failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. After a hearing on April 11, 2006, the jury also awarded Mr McDarby an additional $9 million in punitive damages. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale. By November 2007 Merck announced that it agreed on a mass tort settlement of $4.85 billion between Merck and the lawyers of 27,000 individual lawsuits with a try-every-case strategy as opposed to a class action lawsuit if \\"85 percent of the plaintiffs sign up\\". After the settlement, the lawyers for the case disputed the $315 million awarded in legal fees. Ultimately, the judge determined how the fees would be awarded to the plaintiff's attorneys. Judge Eldon E. Fallon of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana additionally ordered the plaintiff lawyers to cap their fees at 32% of the settlement amount. The above dispute over lawyer fees has caused scholars and observers to consider tort reform throughout the country. Articles on the subject include The Vioxx Litigation: A Critical Look at Trial Tactics, the Tort System, and the Roles of Lawyers in Mass Tort Litigation and 10 Years of Tort Reform in Texas Bring Fewer Suits, Lower Payouts. In November 2011, Merck announced a civil settlement with the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, and individually with 43 US states and the District of Columbia, to resolve civil claims relating to Vioxx. Under the terms of the settlement, Merck agreed to pay two-thirds of a previously recorded $950 million reserve charge in exchange for release from civil liability. Litigation with seven additional states remains outstanding. Under separate criminal proceedings, Merck pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge relating to the marketing of the drug across state lines, incurring a fine of $321.6 million. Possible return to market In November 2017, Massachusetts- based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. In March 2019 Tremeau announced that they had hired as chief development officer a former Merck employee who had been a product development team leader and also was responsible for executive oversight for numerous clinical trials for the COX-2 inhibitor VIOXX (rofecoxib). Tremeau also announced an upcoming clinical trial for rofecoxib and were seeking investigators.

Ferrara He was born in Ferrara.Birthplace marker His father, Tiburzio was a chemist associated with the Este court of Alfonso II d'Este. When the papacy refused to recognize his illegitimate successor the court moved in 1598 under Cesare d'Este, Duke of Modena. During the Cinquecento and due to a host of writers including Ariosto and Tasso Renaissance Ferrara was the literary capital of Italian letters along with Florence, whereas the language of papal Rome was humanist Latin. His identity as a Ferrarese and a Lombard is touted in the pseudonym, Ferrante Longobardi which he used to sustain his independence from the linguistic tyranny of Florence in Il torto ed il diritto del \\"Non si pu√≤\\" (1655). Vocation and Studies Venice: Giunti, 1651 Daniello was the youngest of three sons and barely fifteen when embraced a vocation to the Society of Jesus in 1623. Debarred by his superiors because of his manifest literary talents from the missions in the Indies he would later describe, he attained high distinction in science and letters. After a novitiate of two years at Novellara, Bartoli resumed his studies in Piacenza in 1625. In Parma (1626‚Äì29) he completed his philosophate and (1629‚Äì34) he taught grammar and rhetoric to the boys of the Jesuit collegio.Parma's Collegio dei Nobili trained the sons of the Catholic nobility Under Jesuit scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Niccolo Zucchi the young Bartoli, together with his younger contemporary Francesco Maria Grimaldi was involved in noteworthy experiments and discoveries of the planetary heavens. Bartoli along with Zucchi is credited as having been one of the first to see the equatorial belts on the planet Jupiter on May 17, 1630.Galileo's Planet By Thomas A. Hockey, Page 20 - \\"sources give Fontana, Torricelli, or Niccol√≤ Zucchi... credit for first noting the dark belts girding Jupiter...\\"The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 by Hugh Chisholm, Page 562 And in his old age he would return to the world of science. He was ordained a priest in 1634 and continued his studies in Milan and Bologna. In his thirties he was an esteemed preacher delivering the Lenten sermons at the principal Jesuits churches of Italy including Ferrara, Genoa, Florence and Rome. While in Ferrara he also published a collection of poems under the name of a nephew, as the Jesuits in Italy were not allowed to publish poetry. In his first published work he will quote from a number of these, anonymously. At 35 Bartoli pronounced his final vows as a professed Jesuit in Pistoia on July 31, 1643. In 1645 his treatise on the man of letters, L'huomo di lettere difeso ed emendato catapulted him to national celebrity and international fame as a leading contemporary writer of the High Baroque age. For the rest of the century his treatise was considered a masterpiece of erudition and eloquence. It became a staple of the Italian printing industry and was much sought after and translated. During the process of her conversion to Roman Catholicism at the hands of the Jesuits in the 1650s Christina, Queen of Sweden specifically requested a copy of this celebrated work be sent to her in Stockholm.John J. Renaldo, Daniello Bartoli: A letterato of the Seicento (Naples,1979) p. 41 Heading to preach in Palermo he survived a shipwreck off Capri in 1646, but lost the manuscripts of his sermons.Della Vita del p. Vincenzo Carafa, Settimo Generale della Compagnia di Ges√π (Rome, 1651) pp. 77-78. Because of his growing fame his superiors put an end to his decade as an itinerant preacher and brought him permanently to the order's headquarters in Rome. In 1648 his was appointed Jesuit historiographer and spent the next four decades writing his great history, as well as moral, spiritual and scientific treatises. Baroque Rome rightthumb500x500px'Historia della Compagnia di Giesu del R. P. Daniello Bartoli della medesima Compagnia' Frontispiece by Jan Miel and Cornelis Bloemaert (Roma: de Lazzeri) 1659 The remarkable success of Bartoli's literary debut coincided with the triumph of the High Baroque in Rome and it serves as a testament to the formative role of the Italian Jesuits as cultural entrepreneurs meditating between the sacred and the profane elements of the age. L'huomo di lettere (1645) became a cultural vademecum for the aspirations of a new generation of humanist intellectuals. Its eloquence and erudition found a lively balance between devotion to antiquity and consciousness of the modern. In Italy it was a bestseller. During the decades of Bartoli's life that followed, the work had editions and reprints nearly annually in Rome, Bologna, Florence, Milan and especially Venice. In the same period there were translations in French, German, English, Latin, Spanish and later Dutch. But history was his main task as a Jesuit man of letters. As such Bartoli represents the shift from the preceding Latin humanist historiography of Niccol√≤ Orlandini and Francesco Sacchini to the illustrious Jesuit prose tradition he established in Italian when he undertook the official history of the first century of the Society of Jesus (1540). His monumental Istoria della Compagnia di Gesu (Rome, 1650‚Äì1673), in 6 folio vols. is the longest Italian classic. It begins with an authoritative, if somewhat ponderous, biography of the founder Ignatius Loyola.Della vita e dell'istituto di S. Ignatio, fondatore della Compagnia di Gesu (Rome, 1650) Particularly fascinating and exotic are his histories of Francis Xavier and the Jesuit missions in the East which describe India and the opening of the East, L'Asia (1653) in eight books. A shorter work on Akbar the Great and Rodolfo Acquaviva came out in 1653 and was added to the third edition of L'Asia in 1667.Missione al Gran Mogor del p. Ridolfo Acquaviva della Compagnia di Gesu, sua vita e morte (1653); Salerno (1998);(1714) Part II of the first corner of the world he completed was Japan, Il Giappone (1660) in five books, and the Part III on China, La Cina appeared in four books (1663). To these he opened his projected Europa with the missions on the Jesuits in England, L'Inghilterra (1667) and a final work on the opening years of the order in the Italy of St. Ignatius, Diego Laynez and Francis Borgia, L'Italia (1673). With these histories he alternated treatises on language use, Del torto e del diritto del non si pu√≤ (Rome: de Lazzeri, 1655) and moral works of like La Ricreazione del savio. (Rome: de Lazzeri, 1659) In the 1660s the Lyons Jesuit Louis Janin, translator of L'huomo di lettere issued Latin translations of these histories. From 1671 to 1674 Bartoli served as Rector of the Collegio Romano in recognition of his international prestige as a writer. Indefatigible in his final years Bartoli produced 4 Jesuit biographies and three scientific treatises on pressure, sound, coagulation. His several works of spiritual reflection were brought together a folio edition, Le Morali in 1684. His final work, Pensieri sacri (Venice: Storti, 1685) went to press after his death in Rome, January 13, 1685. During the early nineteenth century, of Leopardi and of Manzoni, Bartoli became the literary paragon as a master of prose style. Outstanding among the numerous printings and anthologies of his works from that period is the standard octavo edition of his complete works beautifully printed by Giacinto Marietti, Turin, 1825-1842 in 34 volumes.

His most popular work, the book Against His-Story, Against Leviathan!, details the rise of state domination with a retelling of history through the Hobbesian metaphor of the Leviathan. Though Perlman detested ideology and claimed that the only \\"-ist\\" he would respond to was \\"cellist,\\" his work as an author and publisher has been influential on modern anarchist thought.  Childhood and youth  Perlman was born August 29, 1934, in Brno, Czechoslovakia, to Henry and Martha Perlman.\\"Deaths: Fredy Perlman,\\" Iowa City Press-Citizen, July 29, 1985, image 3 He immigrated with his parents to Cochabamba, Bolivia, in 1938 just ahead of the Nazi takeover. The Perlman family came to the United States in 1945 and finally settled in Lakeside Park, Kentucky. In 1952 he attended Morehead State College in Kentucky and then UCLA from 1953‚Äì55. Perlman was on the staff of The Daily Bruin, the school newspaper, when the university administration changed the constitution of the newspaper to forbid it from nominating its own editors, as the custom had been. Perlman left the newspaper staff at that time and, with four others, proceeded to publish an independent paper, The Observer, which they handed out on a public sidewalk at the campus bus stop, \\"the traditional center for the distribution of off-campus literature.\\" He earned a master's degree from Columbia University and a doctorate of philosophy from the University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He and Lorraine Nybakken were married on January 6, 1958, in New York City.  Travel and study  Plunder, a play by Fredy Perlman In late 1959, Perlman and his wife took a cross-country motor scooter trip, mostly on two-lane highways traveling at 25 miles per hour. From 1959 to 1963, they lived on the lower east side of Manhattan while Perlman worked on a statistical analysis of the world's resources with John Ricklefs. They participated in anti-bomb and pacifist activities with the Living Theatre and others. Perlman was arrested after a sit-down in Times Square in the fall of 1961. He became the printer for the Living Theatre and during that time wrote The New Freedom, Corporate Capitalism and a play, Plunder, which he published himself. In 1963, the husband and wife left the U.S. and moved to Belgrade, Yugoslavia after living some months in Copenhagen and Paris. Perlman received a master's degree in economics and a PhD at the University of Belgrade's Law School; his dissertation was titled \\"Conditions for the Development of a Backward Region,\\" which created an outrage among some members of the faculty. During his last year in Yugoslavia, he was a member of the Planning Institute for Kosovo and Metohija.  Professional life  During 1966‚Äì69 the couple lived in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Perlman taught social science courses at Western Michigan University and created outrage among some members of the faculty when he had students run their own classes and grade themselves. During his first year in Kalamazoo, he and Milo≈° Samard≈æija, one of his professors from Belgrade, translated Isaac Illych Rubin's Essays on Marx's Theory of Value. Perlman wrote an introduction to the book: \\"An Essay on Commodity Fetishism.\\" In May 1968, after lecturing for two weeks in Turin, Italy, Perlman went to Paris on the last train before rail traffic was shut down by some of the strikes that were sweeping Western Europe that season. He participated in the May unrest in Paris and worked at the Censier center with the Citroen factory committee. After returning to Kalamazoo in August, he collaborated with Roger Gregoire in writing Worker-Student Action Committees, May 68. During his last year in Kalamazoo, Perlman had left the university and together with several other people, mostly students, inaugurated the Black and Red magazine, of which six issues appeared. Typing and layout was done at the Perlman house and the printing at the Radical Education Project in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In January 1969 Perlman completed The Reproduction of Daily Life. While traveling in Europe in the spring of 1969, he spent several weeks in Yugoslavia and there wrote Revolt in Socialist Yugoslavia, which was suppressed by the authorities, who called it a CIA plot. In August 1969 he and his wife Lorraine moved to Detroit, where he wrote The Incoherence of the Intellectual and, collaborating with a small group, translated Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle, publishing the first (and for over a decade, only) English translation of this key Situationist International text in 1970. Industrial Workers of the World union label designed by Perlman for the Detroit Printing Co-op In 1970 Perlman was one of a large group that set up the Detroit Printing Co-op with equipment from Chicago. For the next decade, Black & Red publications were printed there, along with countless other projects ranging from leaflets to newspapers to books. For several years, Perlman and the cooperative were members of the Industrial Workers of the World. Between 1971 and 1976 he worked on several books, originals as well as translations, including Manual for Revolutionary Leaders, Letters of Insurgents, Peter Arshinov's History of the Makhnovist Movement, Voline's The Unknown Revolution, and Jacques Camatte's The Wandering of Humanity. Letters of Insurgents was written by Perlman in the form of letters between two eastern European comrades, one of whom had escaped to the West. It presents critical anti-authoritarian perspectives on life in both the so-called democratic West and the so-called communist East during the era of the cold war. Perlman spent most of his life in North America, but he lived, worked and developed friendships in Yugoslavia over three years spent there. The form of letter exchange enables the writer to present the experiences and thoughts of several characters without pretending to get inside any individual's head. Also during the 1970s, Perlman began playing the 'cello, often in chamber music sessions twice a week. In 1971 he and his wife traveled to Alaska by car. In 1976 Perlman underwent surgery to replace a damaged heart valve. After, he helped write and perform Who's Zerelli? a play critiquing the authoritarian aspects of the medical establishment. During 1977‚Äì80 he studied (and charted) world history. During these years, he traveled to Turkey, Egypt, Europe and regions of the U.S. to visit historic sites. In 1980 he began a comprehensive history of The Strait (Detroit and surroundings). He did not finish this work, and the first and last chapters remain unwritten. In July 1985, he estimated that it would take him eight or ten months to complete and edit the manuscript. Both Perlmans helped on the anti-authoritarian magazine, Fifth Estate, doing typesetting and proofreading as well as contributing articles. His most recent contributions were Anti-Semitism and the Beirut PogromAnti-Semitism and the Beirut Pogrom by Fredy Perlman and The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism. During 1982‚Äì83, he suspended work on The Strait to write his indictment of technological society, Against His-Story, Against Leviathan. Anarchist historian John P. Clark states that Against His-tory, Against Leviathan! describes Perlman's critique of what he saw as \\"the millennia-long history of the assault of the technological megamachine on humanity and the Earth.\\" Clark also notes the book discusses \\"anarchistic spiritual movements\\" such as the Yellow Turban movement in ancient China and the Brethren of the Free Spirit in medieval Europe.John P. Clark, \\"Anarchism\\" in Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, edited by Bron Taylor; New York : Continuum, 2008, pp.49‚Äì56. In 1983, Perlman joined the cello section of the Dearborn Orchestra and, in June 1985, performed quartets by Mozart and Schumann at a program for Physicians for Social Responsibility. In 1984 Perlman wrote a work on the subject of nationalism called The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism.The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism by Fredy Perlman In it he argues that \\"Leftist or revolutionary nationalists insist that their nationalism has nothing in common with the nationalism of fascists and national socialists, that theirs is a nationalism of the oppressed, that it offers personal as well as cultural liberation.\\" And so \\"To challenge these claims, and to see them in a context,\\" he asks \\"what nationalism is ‚Äì not only the new revolutionary nationalism but also the old conservative one.\\" And so he concludes that nationalism is an aid to capitalist control of nature and people regardless of its origin. Nationalism thus provides a form through which \\"Every oppressed population can become a nation, a photographic negative of the oppressor nation\\" and that \\"There's no earthly reason for the descendants of the persecuted to remain persecuted when nationalism offers them the prospect of becoming persecutors. Near and distant relatives of victims can become a racist nation-state; they can themselves herd other people into concentration camps, push other people around at will, perpetrate genocidal war against them, procure preliminary capital by expropriating them.\\" During 1985, Perlman wrote two essays on Nathaniel Hawthorne, whom Perlman regarded ‚Äì along with Hawthorne's contemporaries Thoreau and Melville ‚Äì as a critic of technology and imperialism.Having Little, Being Much Death On July 26, 1985, Perlman died while undergoing heart surgery in Detroit. He was survived by his wife and a brother, Peter Perlman of Lexington, Kentucky.  Selected publications  * * \\"Essay on Commodity Fetishism\\". Telos 6 (Fall 1970).

It is used to treat the pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It is taken by mouth. Benefits are typically seen within an hour. Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Serious side effects may include heart attacks, strokes, gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, and anaphylaxis. Use is not recommended in people at high risk for heart disease. The risks are similar to other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Use in the later part of pregnancy or during breastfeeding is not recommended. Celecoxib was patented in 1993 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 106th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than seven million prescriptions. Medical uses Celecoxib is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain, musculoskeletal pain, painful menstruation, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and to reduce the number of colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It may be used in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who are older than two years of age and weigh more than 10 kg (22 lb). For postoperative pain, it is more or less equal to ibuprofen. For pain relief, it is similar to paracetamol (acetaminophen), which is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis. Evidence of effects are not clear as a number of studies done by the manufacturer have not been released for independent analysis. Mental illness Tentative evidence supports its use in treating a number of psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Familial adenomatous polyposis It has been used to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, but it is not known if it decreases rates of cancer, so it is not a good choice for this reason. Adverse effects * Cardiovascular events: NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Risk may be increased with duration of use or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease. Individual cardiovascular risk profiles should be evaluated prior to prescribing. New- onset hypertension or exacerbation of hypertension may occur (NSAIDs may impair response to thiazide or loop diuretics), and may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure and use with caution in patients with hypertension. May cause sodium and fluid retention, use with caution in patients with edema or heart failure. Long-term cardiovascular risk in children has not been evaluated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of cardiovascular events; alternative therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. The increased risk is about 37%. * Gastrointestinal events: NSAIDs may increase risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal). These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning. Use caution with a history of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers), concurrent therapy with aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, smoking, use of alcohol, the elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with ‚â§325 mg of aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended. The increased risk is about 81%. * Hematologic effects: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in people on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time or platelet counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses. People with prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precaution. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. Allergy Celecoxib contains a sulfonamide moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in people with severe allergies to other NSAIDs. However, it has a low (reportedly 4%) chance of inducing cutaneous reactions among persons who have a history of such reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs. NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; events may occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Use should be discontinued at first sign of rash (or any other hypersensitivity). Heart attack and stroke A 2013 meta-analysis of hundreds of clinical trials found that coxibs (the class of drugs that includes celecoxib) increase the risk of major cardiovascular problems by about 37% over placebo. In 2016, a randomized trial provided strong evidence that treatment with celecoxib is not more likely to result in poor cardiovascular outcomes than treatment with naproxen or ibuprofen. As a result, in 2018 an FDA advisory panel concluded that celecoxib poses no greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than the commonly-used NSAIDs ibuprofen or naproxen and recommended that the FDA consider changing its advice to physicians regarding celecoxib's safety. The COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was removed from the market in 2004 due to its risk. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated \\"black box warning\\" for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the American Heart Association warned that with respect to \\"patients with a prior history of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease... use of COX-2 inhibitors for pain relief should be limited to patients for whom there are no appropriate alternatives, and then, only in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary.\\" In 2005, a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors differ, depending on the drug. Other COX-2-selective inhibitors, such as rofecoxib, have significantly higher myocardial infarction rates than celecoxib. In April 2005, after an extensive review of data, the FDA concluded it was likely \\"that there is a 'class effect' for increased CV risk for all NSAIDs\\". In a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized control studies, the cerebrovascular events associated with COX-2 inhibitors were examined, but no significant risks were found when compared to nonselective NSAIDs or placebos. Drug interactions Celecoxib is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9. Caution must be exercised with concomitant use of 2C9 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, which can greatly elevate celecoxib serum levels. If used concomitantly with lithium, celecoxib increases lithium plasma levels. If used concomitantly with warfarin, celecoxib may result in increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of bleeding and gastric ulcers also increase further when SSRIs are used in combination with celecoxib. The drug may increase the risk of kidney failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme- inhibitors, such as lisinopril, and diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide. Pregnancy In the US FDA's pregnancy categories, the drug is category C prior to 30 weeks gestation, and category D starting at 30 weeks gestation. Mechanism of action Anti-inflammatory A highly selective reversible inhibitor of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, celecoxib inhibits the transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors. Therefore, it has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Nonselective NSAIDs (such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. Inhibition of COX-1 (which celecoxib does not inhibit at therapeutic concentrations) inhibits the production of prostaglandins and the production of thromboxane A2, a platelet activator. COX-1 is traditionally defined as a constitutively expressed \\"housekeeping\\" enzyme and plays a role in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis. COX-2, on the contrary, is extensively expressed in cells involved in inflammation and is upregulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. Celecoxib is approximately 10-20 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1. It binds with its polar sulfonamide side chain to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site.DiPiro, Joseph T., Robert L. Talbert, Gary C. Yee, Gary R. Matzke, Barbara G. Wells, and L. Michael Posey. Pharmacotherapy A Pathophysiologic Approach (Pharmacotherapy (Dipiro) Pharmacotherapy (Dipiro)). New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2008. Print. In theory, this selectivity allows celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors to reduce inflammation (and pain) while minimizing gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (e.g. stomach ulcers) that are common with nonselective NSAIDs. Anti-cancer For its use in reducing colon polyps, celecoxib affects genes and pathways involved in inflammation and malignant transformation in tumors, but not normal tissues. Celecoxib binds to Cadherin-11 (which may explain the reduction in cancer progression). Structure-activity relationship right right right right The Searle research group found the two appropriately substituted aromatic rings must reside on adjacent positions about the central ring for adequate COX-2 inhibition. Various modifications can be made to the 1,5-diarylpyrazole moiety to deduce the structure-activity relationship of celecoxib. A para- sulfamoylphenyl at position 1 of the pyrazole was found to have a higher potency for COX-2 selective inhibition than a para-methoxyphenyl (see structures 1 and 2, below). In addition, a 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl or 4-sulfamoylphenyl is known to be necessary for COX-2 inhibition. For instance, replacing either of these entities with a ‚ÄìSO2NHCH3 substituent diminishes COX-2 inhibitory activity as noted with a very high inhibitory concentration-50 (see structures 3 ‚Äì 5). At the 3-position of the pyrazole, a trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl provides superior selectivity and potency compared to a fluoromethyl or methyl substitution (see structures 6 ‚Äì 9). Celecoxib is compound 22; the 4-sulfamoylphenyl on the 1-pyrazol substituent is required for COX-2 inhibition and the 4-methyl on the 5-pyrazol system has low steric hindrance to maximize potency, while the 3-trifluoromethyl group provides superior selectivity and potency. To explain the selectivity of celecoxib, it is necessary to analyze the free energy of binding difference between the drug molecule and COX-1 compared to COX-2 enzymes. The structural modifications highlight the importance of binding to residue 523 in the side binding pocket of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which is an isoleucine in COX-1 and a valine in COX-2. This mutation appears to contribute to COX-2 selectivity by creating steric hindrance between the sulfonamide oxygen and the methyl group of Ile523 that effectively destabilizes the celecoxib-COX-1 complex. Thus, it is reasonable to expect COX-2-selective inhibitors to be more bulky than nonselective NSAIDs. History It was initially marketed by Pfizer for arthritis. Celecoxib and other COX-2 selective inhibitors, valdecoxib, parecoxib, and mavacoxib, were discovered by a team at the Searle division of Monsanto led by John Talley. Two lawsuits arose over discovery of celecoxib. Daniel L. Simmons of Brigham Young University (BYU) discovered the COX-2 enzyme in 1988, and in 1991, BYU entered into a collaboration with Monsanto to develop drugs to inhibit it. Monsanto's pharmaceutical division was later purchased by Pfizer, and in 2006, BYU sued Pfizer for breach of contract, claiming Pfizer did not properly pay contractual royalties back to BYU. A settlement was reached in April 2012, in which Pfizer agreed to pay $450 million. Other important discoveries in COX-2 were made at University of Rochester, which patented the discoveries. When the patent issued, the university sued Searle (later Pfizer) in a case called, University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court ruled in favor of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.Reach-Through Claims Declared InvalidRanjana Kadle (2004) CAFC Court Decision Reach-Through Claims Declared Invalid According to the National Academy of Sciences, Philip Needleman, who was vice president of Monsanto in 1989 and president of Searle in 1993 oversaw research into COX-2 that led to the development of the anti- inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex). He became senior executive vice president and chief scientist of Pharmacia from 2000 to 2003. Celecoxib was discovered and developed by G. D. Searle & Company and was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1998. It was co-promoted by Monsanto Company (parent company of Searle) and Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex. Monsanto merged with Pharmacia, from which the Medical Research Division was acquired by Pfizer, giving Pfizer ownership of Celebrex. The drug was at the core of a major patent dispute that was resolved in Searle's favor (later Pfizer) in 2004. In University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the University of Rochester claimed that United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 (which claimed a method of inhibiting COX-2 in humans using a compound, without actually disclosing what that compound might be) covered drugs such as celecoxib. The court ruled in favor of Searle, holding in essence that the University had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid. After the withdrawal of rofecoxib from the market in September 2004, celecoxib enjoyed a robust increase in sales. However, the results of the APC trial in December of that year raised concerns that Celebrex might carry risks similar to those of rofecoxib, and Pfizer announced a moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising of Celebrex soon afterwards. Sales reached $2 billion in 2006. Prior to its availability in generic form, it was one of Pfizer's \\"best- selling drugs, amounting to more than $2.5 billion in sales [by 2012], and was prescribed to 2.4 million\\" people in 2011. By 2012, 33 million Americans had taken celecoxib. Pfizer resumed advertising Celebrex in magazines in 2006, and resumed television advertising in April 2007 with an unorthodox, -minute advertisement which extensively discussed the adverse effects of Celebrex in comparison with other anti-inflammatory drugs. The ad drew criticism from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which called the ad's comparisons misleading. Pfizer responded to Public Citizen's concerns with assurances that they are truthfully advertising the risk and benefits of Celebrex as set forth by the FDA. In late 2007, Pfizer released another US television ad for Celebrex, which also discussed celecoxib's adverse effects in comparison with those of other anti-inflammatory drugs. Society and culture Fabricated efficacy studies Pfizer and its partner, Pharmacia presented findings from their study that Celebrex was \\"better in protecting the stomach from serious complications than other drugs.\\" This became Celebrex's main selling point. However, following federal investigations it was revealed that Pfizer and Pharmacia \\"only presented the results from the first six months of a year long study rather than the whole thing.\\" These partial results were then published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the full results of the Pfizer and Pharmacia study which showed that they had withheld crucial data. By 2012, a federal judge unsealed \\"thousands of pages of internal documents and depositions\\" in a \\"long-running securities fraud case against Pfizer.\\" On March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts, revealed that the data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as Vioxx) had been fabricated. The analgesic effects of the drugs had been exaggerated. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for Pfizer. Although from 2002 to 2007 Pfizer underwrote much of Dr. Reuben's research and \\"many of his trials found that Celebrex and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain,\\" Pfizer was not aware of the fraudulent data. None of the retracted studies were submitted to either the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Although Pfizer issued a public statement declaring, \\"It is very disappointing to learn about Dr. Scott Reuben's alleged actions. When we decided to support Dr. Reuben's research, he worked for a credible academic medical center and appeared to be a reputable investigator\\", the documents unsealed in 2012, revealed that by February 2000, Pharmacia employees had devised a strategy to present the findings. Availability Pfizer markets celecoxib under the brand name Celebrex, and it is available as oral capsules containing 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg of celecoxib. It is legally available in many jurisdictions as a generic under several brand names. In the US, celecoxib was covered by three patents, two of which expired on May 30, 2014, and one of which (US RE44048US Re-issued Patent RE44048) was due to expire December 2, 2015. On March 13, 2014, that patent was found to be invalid for double patenting. Upon the patent expiry on May 30, 2014, the FDA approved the first versions of generic celecoxib. Research Cancer prevention The role celecoxib might have in reducing the rates of certain cancers has been the subject of many studies. However, no medical recommendation exists to use this drug for cancer reduction. The use of celecoxib to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer has been investigated, but neither celecoxib nor any other drug is indicated for this use. Small-scale clinical trials in very high-risk people (belonging to FAP families) showed celecoxib can prevent polyp growth. Hence, large-scale randomized clinical trials were undertaken. Results show a 33 to 45% polyp recurrence reduction in people treated with celecoxib each day. However, serious cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in the celecoxib-treated groups. Aspirin shows a similar (and possibly larger) protective effect, has demonstrated cardioprotective effects and is significantly cheaper, but no head-to-head clinical trials have compared the two drugs. Cancer treatment Different from cancer prevention, cancer treatment is focused on the therapy of tumors that have already formed and have established themselves inside the patient. Many studies are going on to determine whether celecoxib might be useful for this latter condition. However, during molecular studies in the laboratory, it became apparent that celecoxib could interact with other intracellular components besides its most famous target, COX-2. The discovery of these additional targets has generated much controversy, and the initial assumption that celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily by the inhibition of COX-2 became contentious. Certainly, the inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of celecoxib. However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug's anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with malignant tumor cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells in vitro, but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2. Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib's anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen analogs of celecoxib were generated with small alterations in their chemical structures. Some of these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others did not. However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in cell culture was investigated, the antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective compound could inhibit COX-2, showing the inhibition of COX-2 was not required for the anticancer effects. One of these compounds, 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, actually displayed stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib.

It is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. It was patented in 1995. Valdecoxib was manufactured and marketed under the brand name Bextra by G. D. Searle & Company as an anti-inflammatory arthritis drug. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on November 20, 2001, to treat arthritis and menstrual cramps. and was available by prescription in tablet form until 2005 when the FDA requested that Pfizer withdraw Bextra from the American market. The FDA cited \\"potential increased risk for serious cardiovascular (CV) adverse events,\\" an \\"increased risk of serious skin reactions\\" and the \\"fact that Bextra has not been shown to offer any unique advantages over the other available NSAIDs.\\" In 2009 Bextra was at the center of the \\"largest health care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind ever.\\" Pfizer paid a $2.3 billion civil and criminal fine. Pharmacia and Upjohn, a Pfizer subsidiary, violated the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for misbranding Bextra \\"with the intent to defraud or mislead.\\" A water-soluble and injectable prodrug of valdecoxib, parecoxib is marketed in the European Union under the tradename Dynastat. Uses until 2005 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved valdecoxib for the treatment of osteoarthritis, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and primary dysmenorrhea. Valdecoxib was also used off-label for controlling acute pain and various types of surgical pain. Side-effects and withdrawal from market On April 7, 2005, Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market on recommendation by the FDA, citing an increased risk of heart attack and stroke and also the risk of a serious, sometimes fatal, skin reaction. This was a result of recent attention to prescription NSAIDs, such as Merck's Vioxx. Other reported side-effects were angina and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome. Pfizer first acknowledged cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra in October 2004. The American Heart Association soon after was presented with a report indicating patients using Bextra while recovering from heart surgery were 2.19 times more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack than those taking placebos. In a large study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2006, valdecoxib appeared less adverse for renal (kidney) disease and heart arrhythmia compared to Vioxx, however elevated renal risks were slightly suggested. 2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions On September 2, 2009, the United States Department of Justice fined Pfizer $2.3 billion after one of its subsidiaries, Pharmacia & UpJohn Company, pleaded guilty to marketing four drugs including Bextra \\"with the intent to defraud or mislead.\\" Pharmacia & UpJohn admitted to criminal conduct in the promotion of Bextra, and agreed to pay the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter, $1.195 billion. A former Pfizer district sales manager was indicted and sentenced to home confinement for destroying documents regarding the illegal promotion of Bextra. In addition, a Regional Manager pleaded guilty to distribution of a mis-branded product, and was fined $75,000 and twenty-four months on probation. The remaining $1 billion of the fine was paid to resolve allegations under the civil False Claims Act case and is the largest civil fraud settlement against a pharmaceutical company. Six whistle- blowers were awarded more than $102 million for their role in the investigation. Former Pfizer sales representative John Kopchinski acted as a qui tam relator and filed a complaint in 2004 outlining the illegal conduct in the marketing of Bextra. Kopchinski was awarded $51.5 million for his role in the case because the improper marketing of Bextra was the largest piece of the settlement at $1.8 billion.

The earliest known banjoleles were built by John A. Bolander and by Alvin D. Keech, both in 1917. The instrument achieved its greatest popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, and combines the small scale, tuning, and playing style of a ukulele with the construction and distinctive tone of a banjo, hence the name. Its development was pushed by the need for vaudeville performers to have an instrument that could be played with the ease of the ukulele, but with more volume. Construction and tuning \\"My dog has fleas\\" tuning. In terms of overall construction, banjo ukuleles parallel banjos, though on a smaller scale. They are always fretted. Most are built of wood with metal accoutrements, although the mid-century \\"Dixie\\" brand featured banjo ukuleles made from solid metal. The banjo ukulele neck typically has sixteen frets, and is the same scale length as a soprano or, less commonly, concert or tenor-sized ukulele. Banjo ukuleles may be open-backed, or may incorporate a resonator. Banjo ukulele heads were traditionally made of calf skin, but most modern instruments are fitted with synthetic heads. Some players prefer the natural skin heads for a more traditional tone. Tightening or loosening the drum head, through adjusting the tension hooks fitted around the outside of the drum, results in a change in tone. The head typically has a firm tension. Tightening it so that it is rock hard to the touch gives a bright sound with good note distinction, but less bass response. Loosening it so it is softer, yet still tight enough to keep the bridge in place with the tension of the strings, results in a warmer, less bright sound. The bridge floats on the head and is held in place by the tension of the strings. Like standard ukuleles, banjo ukuleles were originally outfitted with gut strings. Nylon strings are now typically used, sometimes with a wound third string. The banjolele is commonly tuned G‚ÄìC‚ÄìE‚ÄìA (\\"C Tuning\\") or A‚ÄìD‚ÄìF‚ôØ‚ÄìB (\\"D Tuning\\"), with a re-entrant 4th string. The A‚ÄìD‚ÄìF‚ôØ‚ÄìB tuning often produces a more strident tone, and is used for this reason. Both of these tunings are known as \\"my dog has fleas\\" tunings (fifth, tonic, major third, major sixth). Popular culture British musician right The banjo ukulele was the instrument played by British comedian George Formby (1904‚Äì61), who developed his own style of playing in accompaniment to his comic songs. His name is associated with the instrument more than that of any other musician. Other artists to make eminent use of the banjolele were Wendell Hall and Roy Smeck in the United States, and Billy \\"Uke\\" Scott in Great Britain. In P.G. Wodehouse's 1934 novel Thank You, Jeeves, valet Jeeves is driven to resign over his employer Bertie Wooster's decision to take up the banjo ukulele. In Season 2 of Orange Is the New Black, prison guard O'Neill excitedly tells Caputo about his purchase of a banjo ukulele. He later plays it for a group of nuns. British comedian Peter Sellers was a banjo ukulele player and recorded New York Girls with Steeleye Span Queen member Brian May used a banjo ukulele in the song \\"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\\", which appeared on their third album Sheer Heart Attack. He also used one to compose \\"Good Company\\" for their album A Night at the Opera, although on the recording he used a regular ukulele. George Harrison favored the instrument in his later years, using it in several recordings. For example, he played it on his song \\"Any Road\\". Recent users of the banjo ukulele have included Jeff Claus of The Horse Flies, Alan Randall, Andy Eastwood, comedian Frank Skinner, Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer, and Steven Universe creator Rebecca Sugar. The instrument can be heard in the theme song to the television show Arrested Development. ‚ÄúJust received a big new shipment of banjo-ukuleles and ukuleles ranging in prices from $5 to $30 cases and bags. $1.00 to $3.50 all other string instruments in stock.‚Äù ‚ÄúJ.

Taxonomy Taxonomic History The genus Picris was first validly described by Linnaeus in 1753 with the genus being accepted by a number of secondary sources including Plants of the World Online. Linnaeus initially described four species with P. hieracioides, P. echioides, P. pyrenaica and P. asplenioides. In 1913, Britton and Brown proposed P. asplenioides as the type species for the genus. Subsequently, in 1930, Hitchcock and Green alternatively proposed P. hieracioides as the type species. The Hitchcock and Green proposal was adopted by Lack in 1975 and accepted by Jarvis in 1992. Lack argued that Linnaeus never saw P. asplenioides which Linnaeus regarded as an obscure species and no specimen could be found in the Linnean Herbarium. For this reason Lack concluded that P. hieracioides should be designated as the type species. In 1794, the German botanist Conrad Moench described the genus Medicusia and the species M. aspera. This genus has not been accepted and is considered a synonym of Picris. M. aspera has also been determined to be a synonym of P. rhagadioloides.

In his scientific work, he focused mainly on concepts related to social gerontology, which touched upon, inter alia, the situation of the elderly in the countryside environments and the influences of the transformation processes. He researched the countryside environment in the Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania, where he focused mainly on the changes on the countryside areas under the influence of the processes of migration, urbanization, the situation of elderly farmers, generation conflicts, the social advancement of the youth.C.

In 1991, Brunon Synak and other researchers were awarded the Stolem Medal for this monograph by \\"Pomorania\\" Student Organization. In 2012, his contribution in this area was appreciated again - he was awarded the Jan Heweliusz Scientific Prize of the City of Gda≈Ñsk (Nagroda Naukowa Miasta Gda≈Ñska im. Jana Heweliusza). Brunon Synak held also administrative positions at the University of Gda≈Ñsk; he was a member of the rectorial council for many years. In 1984, he was appointed to the position of the Pro-rector for Student Affairs, from which he resigned, together with other representatives of the University authorities, in the name of solidarity with Rector Karol Taylor. Taylor was dismissed from his position after he, together with his co- employees, participated in the funeral of the student Marcin Antonowicz who had been fatally beaten by the Citizen's Militia of the Polish People's Republic.M.

Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 167‚Äì168, 171‚Äì175, 178‚Äì180. He became a member of the rectorial council again in 1990, when he was appointed to the position of the Pro-rector for Teaching Affairs (later the name of the position was changed into Pro-rector for Educational Affairs). Under the supervision of Rector Zbigniew Grzonka, he prepared a programme of a reform of the previous manner of teaching at the University of Gda≈Ñsk. Although the programme was accepted, it was not fully implemented. He continued holding the position of Pro-rector in the next term (his candidature was passed with one vote).B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 183‚Äì184, 186‚Äì187. During the presidential campaign in 1995, with regard to journalists' questions as to the authenticity of Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski's declaration of having a degree of higher education, he stated that in the light of the documents of the University, the politician had not graduated from higher education studies.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 190‚Äì191. Brunon Synak was also a lecturer at the Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management (Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Turystyki i Hotelarstwa) in Gda≈Ñsk.  Political and local-governmental activity  In 1969, he was admitted to the then- ruling Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR). Later he justified the decision with conformism. After the events of August 1980, he became a member of the University branch of the Solidarity Trade Union (Niezale≈ºny SamorzƒÖdny ZwiƒÖzek Zawodowy \\"Solidarno≈õƒá\\"), whom he was up to 2006.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 333. He resigned from membership in the PZPR after the declaration of martial law in 1981.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 333‚Äì334. In the elections of 1998, he was elected from the Electoral Action Solidarity list for the freshly established Pomeranian local government (sejmik). In 2002, he was reelected for the second term from a joint list of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska, PO) and Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwo≈õƒá, PiS) (as a candidate of the Civic Platform). He was then appointed the Chairman of sejmik.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 281‚Äì283. He became the initiator of actions stressing the heritage and diversity of the Pomeranian province (wojew√≥dztwo) - devoting subsequent years to particular cultural subregions of the province. In 2006, from the list of the Civic Platform, he was elected for the third term and again became the Chairman. In 2010 he decided to pull back political activity, mainly on account of his progressive illness. As part of over-regional activity, in the years 2000-2004, Brunon Synak presided over the Baltic Sea States Subregional Co- operation Conference.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 294‚Äì295. He also participated in the works of the Committee of Regions of the European Union, was a Deputy Chairman of a fraction of the European People's Party in the RC.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 302. In 2004, he was a candidate for the European Parliament and gained almost 34 thousand votes.  Activity in the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association  In 1985, he became a member of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association. Soon, he was elected a member of the Main Board of the organisation. He was there responsible for cooperation with and taking care of \\"Pomorania\\" Student Organisation, for which the Association is an umbrella organisation.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 201. On 5 December 1998, he was elected the Chairman of the Main Board of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association (in 2000, the position was renamed as the Chairman of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association). He held this position for the next two terms until December 2004.C. Obracht-Prondzy≈Ñski, Zjednoczeni w idei.

During his management, field structures of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association in Kashubia developed but at the same time, branches in Kociewie and Bory Tucholskie went into decline. As a result of his actions, the buildings of the Kashubian People's University (Kaszubski Uniwersytet Ludowy) in Wie≈ºyca and Starbienino became the Association's ownership.C.

When he presided over the Association, Brunon Synak strived for elements of Kashubian culture and language to be present during the service and liturgy. In October 2004, he initiated the Kashubian trip to Rome to pray for the beatification of bishop Konstantyn Dominik. For the first time in the history of St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, a mass was said with elements of the liturgy in the Kashubian language.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 259. During his presiding over the Association, in June 1999, the first Convention of Kashubians took place in Chojnice.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 399‚Äì400. At that time, works on the Act of 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and Regional Languages were in progress.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 232‚Äì236.  Publications  Brunon Synak has published ca. 250 scientific works. His first book, a changed version of his doctoral dissertation, was \\"Problems of Old Farmers\\" (\\"Problemy starych rolnik√≥w\\"), published in 1976.B. Synak, Moja kaszubska Stegna, Pelplin 2010, s. 136. In 2010, he published a book \\"My Kashubian Path\\" (\\"Moja kaszubska stegna\\"), in which autobiographical threads are included with reference to his own thoughts on the fate of Kashubians from the end of WW II to the current times.

The area is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The harbour at West Bay is not a natural landscape feature and it has a long history of having been silted up, blocked by shingle and damaged by storms, and each time repairs, improvements and enlargements have subsequently been made. The harbour has been moved twice: it was originally inland, then was moved to the coast beside the East Cliff, then was moved again along the coast to the west, where it is located today. The previous main commercial trade of the harbour‚Äîexporting Bridport's ropes and nets‚Äîdeclined in the second half of the 19th century. When the railway arrived in 1884, attempts were made to provide the settlement with the facilities of a resort, and today West Bay has a mixed economy of tourism and fishing. History East Beach and East Cliff. Before the mid 18th century, the harbour and river mouth were near the base of the grassy slope Bridport historically needed a harbour to export its principal products, rope and nets.Eastwood, p12 Originally the harbour was about inland, close to the town,Eastwood, p8 and its exit to the sea‚Äîthe river mouth‚Äîwas east of its current position.Eastwood, p7 The Anglo-Saxons and Normans struggled to keep the harbour open because the river mouth repeatedly silted up and was blocked by shingle from Chesil Beach, so eventually a system of sluices was devised to help keep it clear. In 1388 John Huderesfeld, a local merchant, started building a new harbour and levied a toll on goods loaded and unloaded.Eastwood, p13 The toll was a market privilege granted to him for three years as a result of his petition that finishing the construction would not be possible without aid. After completion in 1395 a customs officer was employed full-time as trade grew. The new harbour prospered for fifty years until winter storms and an outbreak of Black Death damaged both its structure and trade, so in 1444 construction of a new harbour commenced‚Äîprompted by an indulgence granted by the Bishop of Sarum‚Äîand on its completion the harbour again prospered. By the 18th century the small harbour was ill-equipped to deal with the increasing size of ships, plus the problems of silting and storm damage had never been fully resolved, so in 1740 work commenced on building another new harbour to the west. This is the site of the harbour as seen today. Two piers, extending as far as the low tide mark, were constructed to house the harbour. The river was also diverted to run between the piers. The work cost ¬£3,500 and was undertaken by John Reynolds of Cheshire. It was supposed to have taken only two years, but the new harbour didn't open officially until 1744. It could hold forty sailing ships.Eastwood, p9 Shipbuilding yards were set up west of the new harbour. They constructed a variety of vessels including frigates, cutters, schooners, brigantines, barques and fishing smack.Eastwood, p10 The first registered launch was the 270 ton brig Adventurer in 1779, the last was the Lilian exactly a century later. The largest launch was the 1,002 ton Speedy in 1853. At one point the yards employed 300 men. In 1823, to accommodate further increases in trade, the basin of the harbour was enlarged eastwards and the old harbour gates were replaced by a sluice. As well as exporting Bridport's ropes, the harbour also imported raw materials such as gravel, coal and timber. By 1830 over 500 vessels were using the harbour each year. Around 1865 the wooden piers were rebuilt in stone and the sluices were rebuilt.Eastwood, p11 Despite these improvements however, trade at the harbour had begun to decline. Bridport's rope and nets were in less demand, and sailing ships were being supplanted by steam-powered vessels. In addition, the Great Western Railway's Bridport Railway had reached Bridport in 1857, and started taking the harbour's trade. The amount of harbour dues taken showed the extent of the decline: in 1881 they amounted to only 10% of those collected half a century before. The new Quay West development on the west side of the harbour The railway was extended from Bridport to Bridport Harbour in 1884. The railway company named the new harbour station West Bay,Eastwood, p6 as part of an effort to rebrand the harbour as a resort. Local businessmen‚Äîincluding the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers and the Earl of Ilchester‚Äîfunded the extension. Subsequently, they established the West Bay Building Company to build villas and lodging houses for visitors. Only a terrace of ten lodging houses‚ÄîPier Terrace‚Äîwas completed, designed by the Arts and Crafts Movement architect Edward Schroeder Prior in 1885.Lefaivre, L Tzonis, A (2012) Architecture of Regionalism in the Age of Globalization: Peaks and Valleys in the Flat World, Routledge, P109 In 1942, because the terrace had an appearance reminiscent of some northern French ports, West Bay was used as a training ground for the Dieppe Raid. The terrace remains a prominent feature of the harbourside. Between 1919 and 1930, coinciding with increased car ownership and personal mobility, new housing was built on the hillslope to the west of the harbour, on the landward side of West Cliff. The railway line between West Bay and Bridport closed to passengers in 1930, and operated for goods services only until its final closure in 1962.Bridport Railway at westbay.co.ukWest Bay station at Disused Stations The station however was restored in the 1980s, and two old railway coaches have been installed on a short length of relaid track. In the second half of the 20th century further residential and tourism-related development occurred around the harbour and old shipbuilding area: new houses were built, old buildings were converted into caf√©s and shops, and several car parks were created. At the start of the 21st century, as part of a new coastal defence scheme, the harbour's west pier was replaced and the east pier rebuilt; the work was completed in March 2005. The new west pier is named the Jurassic Pier. The scheme extended the facilities of the harbour, with a new slipway and outer harbour. This has enabled the harbour to be used on the 50% of days when southerly swell conditions occur, which previously was not possible. After the construction work a small regeneration scheme was implemented, with new housing‚Äîcalled Quay West‚Äîbuilt on the west side of the harbour, on part of the old shipyard area. Government West Bay as viewed from East Cliff West Bay lies within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency and is currently represented at Westminster by Chris Loder. Dorset Council is responsible for services such as highways, public transport, strategic planning, environmental services and environmental health, tourism and leisure, economic development, local planning and development control, and social services. At the parish level, West Bay is mostly within the South ward of Bridport Parish, though small areas also lie within the parishes of Symondsbury and Burton Bradstock. The parish authority for Bridport is Bridport Town Council, which is responsible for supplementing local government services and promoting and representing the town. The South ward is represented by nine councillors. Geography and geology View of East Cliff, showing the alternating horizontal bands of harder and softer rock strata West Bay is situated at the mouth of the River Brit on the English Channel coast. It is south of Bridport and west-northwest of Weymouth and lies within the Dorset Council administrative area. The coast at West Bay forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site which stretches for and includes most of the Dorset coastline. West Bay also lies within the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. West Bay is sited on deposits of river alluvium that indicate a former estuary. There are beaches and cliffs on either side of the harbour. The beaches were previously of a similar size‚Äîin terms of their seaward extent‚Äîbut now East Beach is considerably larger, due to accumulation of finer sediment. East Beach is also designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and forms one end of Chesil Beach, a barrier beach which extends southeast for toward the Isle of Portland. The cliffs to the east of the harbour are composed of Bridport Sand Formation and Inferior Oolite, while immediately to the west they are Frome Clay (Upper Fullers Earth) and Forest Marble. The Bridport Sands deposits were laid down in the Toarcian Age toward the end of the Early Jurassic; they are arranged horizontally with clear banding visible alternating between harder and softer material. The cliff's distinctive colour is a result of oxidisation of fine pyrite grains, resulting in limonite. The Frome Clay and Forest Marble of the West Cliff are younger and were formed in the Bathonian Age of the Middle Jurassic. The section of the West Cliff closest to the harbour has been engineered as part of coastal defence management; large protective boulders on the foreshore are backed by a sea wall, promenade and artificial grass-covered slope. There are several geological faults in the West Bay area. The Eype Mouth Fault, resulting from movement late in the Cimmerian Orogeny (but probably originating in the Jurassic), has a vertical displacement of and is aligned east-west, emerging on the coast obliquely in West Cliff. It is intersected in the Brit Valley by the Mangerton Strike-Slip Fault, a later movement‚Äîprobably Paleogene or Neogene‚Äîwhich is aligned roughly northeast-southwest. The West Beach and West Cliff, showing the artificial cliff sloping and sea wall protecting the interwar houses on the valley side Coastal defence management The coast at West Bay is an eroding landscape, with various processes involved. The coastline faces southwest‚Äîthe direction of the prevailing winds‚Äîtoward the Atlantic Ocean, where the fetch length is over , resulting in the potential for large and destructive swell waves. The 18th-century construction of the harbour piers interrupted the natural transport of protective sediment along the shore, reducing the size of the West Beach and enabling the sea to more easily cause damage. The West Cliff is subject to the non-marine processes of slipping and mass slumping, caused by the clay sliding over lower layers and possibly exacerbated by faults within it. The East Cliff is protected to a degree by the East Beach, though it is still eroded by wave attrition and pounding at its base, resulting in rock falls. Over the decades various initiatives have been put in place to try and protect property and livelihoods. A sea wall was constructed behind the West Beach in 1887, then was rebuilt in 1982. The first section of the West Cliff‚Äîand the houses behind it‚Äîwas protected in 1969 with construction of rock piles, a further sea wall, and artificial sloping of the cliff face. In 1986 the East Beach was artificially raised with extra shingle to a height of above Ordnance Datum; subsequent management by the Environment Agency has involved regular monitoring and replenishment of this shingle barrier. Despite such measures, serious storm damage or flooding events occurred seven times between 1974 and 1996. Assessments by structural engineers in 2001 concluded that, without remedial action, there was a 50% chance of a major failure of the old piers and sea walls within five years. The recent West Bay Coastal Defence and Harbour Improvements Scheme (construction of the Jurassic Pier and outer harbour) is the latest attempt to solve these problems. Cliff Falls In July 2012 Charlotte Blackman, 22, of Heanor, Derbyshire, died when a 160ft (50m) cliff at the eastern end of East Cliff collapsed on top of her. Her boyfriend Matt Carnell and father Kevin were also buried beneath the rocks, but were pulled free from the rubble by rescuers. The production team of Broadchurch was criticised by the West Bay coastguards in June 2014 for filming too close to the edge of East Cliff. Severe weather and recent rock- slides left the cliffs unstable, and a coastguard volunteer said the production team should have used stakes, safety lines, harnesses, and helmets. A spokesperson for the Broadchurch production defended the film crew, noting that the production team had received all necessary filming permits, had visited the site numerous times to ensure safety, and taken other reasonable health and safety precautions.. In 2019 a group of walkers had a lucky escape when walking underneath East Cliff which crumbled above them resulting in the fall of 1,000 tonnes of rock on to the beach below. This was caught on the Environment Agency's CCTV. Economy West Bay is a centre for fishing, tourism (focused on boats and the beach) and geology. Kiosks selling fish and chips by the harbour Tourism and leisure Fishing trips are available in the summer, including deep sea fishing. Boats can also be hired to row up the River Brit towards Bridport. The harbour has a secure boat park, holding up to seventy boats and entered via an electronic fob system; it is located behind the George Hotel and operates a waiting-list system. The West Bay area has a number of local caravan and camping sites, as well as hotels and B&Bs;, both in the bay area and the surrounding villages such as Burton Bradstock. The West Bay harbour area has many kiosks serving various types of menus, including traditional fish and chips, often with locally caught fish. Near the harbour area are three pubs, each serving food. The Station Kitchen is a restaurant in the old West Bay station which includes a World War One ambulance train carriage. The Bridport and West Dorset Golf Club, situated on top of the east cliff, has a full 18-hole course. Filming location West Bay beach was used in the introduction to the BBC television series The Fall and Rise of Reginald PerrinThe Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin at Comedy England. Retrieved January 2009 and for location filming in the television series Harbour Lights. The town, harbour, and beach were used as locations in The Navy Lark and the 2013 ITV series Broadchurch. The West Bay and Bridport area experienced an increase in visitor numbers following transmission of Broadchurch; in one survey of sixty tourism-related local businesses, over three-quarters of respondents stated that trade had increased in 2013, and nearly half of these attributed this to Broadchurch. Very short portions of the second and third series were also filmed in the area.https://www.firstgroup.com/wessex-dorset-south-somerset/plan- journey/jurassic-coaster/visit-real-broadchurch  Literary reference  West Bay is mentioned in Thomas Hardy's The Trumpet-Major, the French are rumoured to have invaded England there.

Founded in 1278 by means of a treaty between the bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix, this unique diarchical arrangement has persisted through medieval times to the 21st century. Currently, the bishop of Urgell (Joan Enric Vives Sic√≠lia) and the president of France (Emmanuel Macron) serve as Andorra's princes, following the transfer of the count of Foix's claims to the Crown of France and, thence, to the president of France. Each prince appoints a personal representative, the French prince currently being represented by Patrick Strzoda and the Episcopal prince by Josep Maria Mauri. Origin and development of the co-principality Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting against the Moors. The feudal overlord of this territory was at first the Count of Urgell. In 988, however, the count, Borrell II, gave Andorra to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya. The bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has ruled Andorra ever since.Things about the history of Andorra French Co- prince Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection, and since the bishop of Urgell knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, he asked for help from the lord of Caboet. In 1095, the lord and the bishop signed a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellb√≤, and both became viscounts of Castellb√≤ and Cerdanya. Their daughter, Ermessenda, married Roger Bernat II, the French count of Foix. They became, respectively, count and countess of Foix, viscount and viscountess of Castellb√≤ and Cerdanya, and also co-sovereigns of Andorra (together with the bishop of Urgell). In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix. The conflict was mediated by Aragon in 1278, and led to the signing of the first par√©age, which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count and the bishop. This gave the principality its territory and political form, and marked the formal commencement of Andorra's unique monarchical arrangement. Through inheritance, the Foix title to Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre. After King Henry III of Navarre became King Henry IV of France, he issued an edict in 1607 establishing the king of France and the bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812‚Äì13, the First French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it into four d√©partements, with Andorra forming part of the district of Puigcerd√† (department of S√®gre). Following the defeat of Napoleon I, a royal decree reversed this annexation, and Andorra reverted to its former independence and political state. The French head of state--whether king, emperor, or president--has continued to serve as a co-prince of Andorra ever since. Recent history On 12 July 1934, Andorra's monarchical system was challenged by an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff, who issued a proclamation in Urgell declaring himself \\"Boris I, King of Andorra\\".Events, Issues 19-24, page 46, 1938 Though initially enjoying some support within Andorra's political establishment, he was ultimately arrested by Spanish authorities on 20 July of that year after declaring war on the bishop of Urgell (who had refused to relinquish his own claim to the principality). Skossyreff was expelled, and was never considered to have been the Andorran monarch in any legal sense. Before 1993, Andorra had no codified constitution, and the exact prerogatives of the co-princes were not specifically defined in law. In March of that year, a Constitution was approved by a vote of the Andorran people and signed into law by the two reigning co-princes at the time: President Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Bishop Joan Mart√≠ Alanis. It clarified the continuance of the unique Andorran monarchy, and also delineated the precise role and prerogatives of the two co-princes. Prior to adoption of the Constitution, Andorra paid in odd-numbered years a tribute of approximately $460 to the French ruler, while on even-numbered years, it paid a tribute of approximately $12 to the Spanish bishop, plus six hams, six cheeses, and six live chickens. This medieval custom was subsequently abandoned in 1993.Andorra: Septicentennial for a Ministate, from Time, 30 October 1978. In 2009, French president Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to abdicate as co-prince if the principality did not change its banking laws to eliminate its longstanding status as a tax haven.Sarkozy threatens to renounce Andorran title. Contemporary political role The Constitution of Andorra carefully defines the exact role and prerogatives of the co-princes of Andorra today. The constitution establishes Andorra as a \\"parliamentary coprincipality\\",Constitution of Andorra, 1:4. providing for the president of France and bishop of Urgell to serve together as joint heads of state.Constitution of Andorra, 43:1-2. The constitution distinguishes between which powers they may exercise on their own (Article 46), and which require the countersignature of the head of the Andorran government, or the approval of the \\"S√≠ndic General\\", the Andorran legislature (Article 45). Powers the princes may exercise on their own include:Constitution of Andorra, Article 46. *Joint exercise of the \\"prerogative of grace\\" (the power to pardon); *Each co- prince may appoint one member of the Superior Council of Justice and one member of the Constitutional Tribunal; *Establishment of such services as they deem necessary to fulfil their constitutional prerogatives, and appointment of individuals to fulfil these services; *Requesting a preliminary judgement about the constitutionality of proposed laws, or of international treaties; *Agreeing to the text of any international treaty, prior to submitting it for parliamentary approval; *Bringing a case before the Constitutional Tribunal in the event of any conflict over the exercise of their constitutional prerogatives. Powers the princes may exercise in conjunction with the head of government include:Constitution of Andorra, Article 45. *Calling for elections or referendums in accordance with constitutional provisions; *Appointing the head of government in accordance with constitutional provisions; *Dissolve the General Council (the Andorran legislature) prior to the expiration of its current term (but not until at least one year has passed since the prior election);Constitution of Andorra:45:1:E and 71:1-3. *Accrediting diplomatic representatives from Andorra to foreign states, and receive credentials of foreign representatives to Andorra; *Appointing office-holders in accordance with appropriate constitutional provisions; *Sanctioning and enacting laws in accordance with constitutional provisions; *Granting formal consent to international treaties, once ratified by the General Council. Each prince is granted an annual allowance by the General Council to dispose of as he or she sees fit.Constitution of Andorra, 47. Each appoints a personal representative in Andorra,Constitution of Andorra, 48. and in the case of incapacitation of one of them, the constitution provides for the other prince to govern in his or her absence, with the concurrence of the Andorran head of government or the General Council.Constitution of Andorra, 45:3. Certain treaties require the participation of the co-princes (or their designated representatives) in their negotiation process as well as their final approval; these are detailed in Articles 66 and 67 of the constitution. The co-princes jointly retain the right to propose amendments to the constitution; this same right rests with the General Council.Constitution of Andorra, 105. They have no veto power over legislation passed by the General Council, though they do retain a veto over certain international treaties, as described above.

Travolta plays an FBI agent and Cage plays a terrorist, sworn enemies who assume each other's physical appearance. The first Hollywood film in which Woo was given major creative control, Face/Off earned critical acclaim for its acting performances (especially Cage and Travolta), stylized action sequences, John Powell's musical score, emotional depth, originality, humor, direction and stunts. It is often cited to be Woo's best Hollywood film. A commercial success, the film earned $245 million worldwide making it the 11th highest- grossing film of 1997. The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger and Per Hallberg) at the 70th Academy Awards. Plot On September 9, 1991, FBI Special Agent Sean Archer survives an assassination attempt by freelance terrorist and homicidal sociopath Castor Troy, but the bullet penetrates Archer's chest and strikes his son Michael, killing the boy. Six years later, Archer's vendetta against Troy culminates in his team's ambush of Troy and his younger brother and accomplice Pollux at the Los Angeles International Airport. Troy goads Archer with knowledge of a bomb located somewhere in the city set to go off in a few days, but he is knocked into a coma before Archer can learn more. Pollux, in custody, affirms that the bomb is real, but does not know its location. At the suggestion of his partner Tito Biondi and Special Ops specialist Dr. Hollis Miller, Archer secretly undergoes a highly experimental face transplant procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh to take on Troy's face, voice, and appearance. Archer is taken to the same high-security prison where Pollux is being held, and slowly convinces Pollux that he is Troy, gaining information on the bomb's location. Meanwhile, Troy unexpectedly awakens from his coma and discovers his face missing. He calls his gang, and they force Dr. Walsh to transplant Archer's face onto him. Troy then kills Dr. Walsh, Biondi, and Miller, the only three who knew of the transplant. At the prison, Archer prepares to tell Biondi of the location but is surprised when Troy appears instead, with Archer's face. Troy goads Archer that no one knows of the transplant, and that he will take over Archer's life. Pollux is freed when he willingly tells Troy- as-Archer of the bomb's location, and Troy disarms the bomb in a dramatic fashion. Troy-as-Archer earns admiration from the FBI office and becomes close to Archer's wife Eve and daughter Jamie, whom Archer had been neglecting while chasing down Troy. Meanwhile, Archer-as-Troy escapes after staging a riot and retreats to Troy's headquarters posing as Troy. There, he meets Sasha, the sister of Troy's primary drug kingpin, and her son Adam, who reminds Archer of Michael. Archer discovers that Adam is Troy's son. Troy learns of Archer's escape and hastily assembles a team to raid his headquarters. The raid quickly turns into a bloodbath, killing numerous FBI agents and several members of Troy's gang, including Pollux. During this Archer, Sasha, and Adam are able to escape. Archer's supervisor, Director Victor Lazarro, blames Troy-as-Archer for the numerous slayings. Troy, furious over Pollux's death, kills Lazarro, making it look like a heart attack. Troy-as-Archer is promoted to acting director as plans are made for Lazarro's funeral. Archer finds safety for Sasha and Adam. He then approaches Eve, and convinces her to test Troy-as- Archer's blood to prove his identity. Convinced of her husband's identity, Eve tells Archer that Troy will be vulnerable at Lazarro's funeral. At the ceremony, Archer finds that Troy has anticipated his actions and takes Eve hostage. Sasha arrives, and a gunfight ensues; Sasha manages to save Eve after taking a bullet. Archer promises a dying Sasha to take care of Adam and raise him away from criminal life. Troy flees the church with Archer pursuing him. Before killing two more federal agents, Troy briefly takes Jamie hostage, but she escapes by stabbing him with a butterfly knife that Troy had given her for self-defense. A speedboat chase ensues in which Archer forces Troy to shore by collision, then bests Troy in a melee fight. Troy mutilates his own/Archer's face to taunt and distract him, but Archer instead gains the upper hand and impales Troy with a spear gun, killing him. Backup agents arrive and address Archer by name, having been convinced by Eve of Archer's true identity. After the face transplant surgery is reversed, Archer returns home, adopting Adam into his family and keeping his promise to Sasha.

It took numerous studios, producers and rewrites before John Woo became attached several years later.Christopher Heard. Ten thousand bullets: the cinema of John Woo. Los Angeles: Lone Eagle Publ, 2000. The first actors who were chosen to play Sean Archer and Castor Troy were Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger respectively but John Woo instead hired John Travolta and Nicolas Cage to play those characters. For the Archer character, Woo considered casting either Michael Douglas or Jean-Claude Van Damme with whom he had worked in Hard Target. During development Douglas and Harrison Ford were attached to star. When the film was eventually made, Douglas served as an executive producer. Werb and Colleary have cited White Heat (1949) and Seconds (1966) as influences on the plot. With an $80 million production budget, Face/Off made heavy use of action set pieces including several violent shootouts and a boat chase filmed in the Los Angeles area. The boat scene at the end of the film was shot in San Diego. Calling the brothers Castor and Pollux is a reference to Greek mythology; Castor and Pollux are the twins transformed by Zeus into the constellation Gemini.http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-movies-plots-given-away-by-characters- names Release Box office Face/Off was released in North America on June 27, 1997 and earned $23,387,530 on its opening weekend, ranking number one in the domestic box office. It went on to become the 11th highest domestic and 14th worldwide grossing film of 1997, earning a domestic total of $112,276,146 and $133,400,000 overseas for a total of worldwide gross of $245,676,146. Home media The Region 1 DVD of Face/Off was one of the first films to be released on the format on October 7, 1998. A 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD was released on September 11, 2007 and the now-defunct HD DVD on October 30, 2007 in the United States. The new DVD is a 2-disc set including 7 deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and several featurettes. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on October 1, 2007 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, and was released in the United States on May 20, 2008 by Paramount Home Entertainment. Reception The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes records that 92% of 86 critical reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"John Travolta and Nicolas Cage play cat-and-mouse (and literally play each other) against a beautifully stylized backdrop of typically elegant, over-the-top John Woo violence.\\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 82 out of 100 from 25 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The role reversal between Travolta and Cage was a subject of praise, as were the stylized, violent action sequences. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four and remarked that, \\"Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the 'other' character is 'really' playing it.\\" Rolling Stones Peter Travers said of the film, \\"You may not buy the premise or the windup, but with Travolta and Cage taking comic and psychic measures of their characters and their own careers, there is no resisting Face/Off. This you gotta see.\\" Richard Corliss of Time said that the film \\"isn't just a thrill ride, it's a rocket into the thrilling past, when directors could scare you with how much emotion they packed into a movie.\\" Barbara Shulgasser of the San Francisco Examiner called the movie \\"idiotic\\" and argued that \\"a good director would choose the best of the six ways and put it in his movie. Woo puts all six in. If you keep your eyes closed during a Woo movie and open them every six minutes, you'll see everything you need to know to have a perfectly lovely evening at the cinema.\\" The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger and Per Hallberg) at the 70th Academy Awards, but lost to another Paramount film Titanic. Face/Off also won Saturn Awards for Best Director and Best Writing, and the MTV Movie Awards for Best Action Sequence (the speedboat chase) and Best On-Screen Duo for Travolta and Cage. Face/Off is said to have inspired Infernal Affairs. However, Infernal Affairs director Andrew Lau wanted to have a more realistic situation; instead of a physical face change, Lau wanted to have the characters swap identities. The concept of \\"bian lian\\" or \\"change face\\", a technique traditionally used in Chinese opera, may have been used here to depict the fluid and seamless morph of Chen and Lau's characters' identities between the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" sides. Infernal Affairs in turn has spawned several adaptations, notably The Departed directed by Martin Scorsese which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Soundtrack The Face/Off soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on July 1, 1997, the week following the film's release. Several pieces of music and songs were used in the film but not included in the soundtrack. These include: * \\"Hallelujah\\" from oratorio Messiah ‚Äì George Frideric Handel * Pamina's Aria \\"Ach, ich f√ºhl's\\" from \\"Die Zauberfl√∂te\\" ‚Äì Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart * \\"Prelude in D-flat, Op. 28, No. 15\\" (\\"Raindrop\\") ‚Äì Fr√©d√©ric Chopin * \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\" ‚Äì James Brown * \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg) ‚Äì Olivia Newton-John * \\"Christiansands\\" ‚Äì Tricky * \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" ‚Äì INXS * \\"Miserere mei, Deus (VV.1-4 & 17-20)\\" ‚Äì Gregorio Allegri Reboot Paramount Pictures announced in September 2019 plans to reboot Face/Off with a new cast. David Permut will be executive producer, with Neal Moritz to produce and Oren Uziel to write.

Sheer-walled canyons cut deep into sandstone and granite‚Äìgneiss‚Äìschist rock formations. This is an area of desert land high on the Colorado Plateau, with pinyon and juniper forests on the plateau. The park hosts a wide range of wildlife, including red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, ravens, jays, desert bighorn sheep, and coyotes.Colorado Division of Wildlife. http://wildlife.state.co.us/Education/TeacherResources/ColoradoWildlifeCompany/ColoradoNatlMonument.htm , accessed 8-03-09 Activities include hiking, horseback riding, road bicycling, and scenic drives; a visitor center on the west side contains a natural history museum and gift shop. There are scenic views from trails, Rim Rock Drive, which winds along the plateau, and the campground. Nearby are the Book Cliffs and the largest flat-topped mountain in the world, the Grand Mesa. The monument's feature attraction is Monument Canyon, which runs the width of the park and includes rock formations such as Independence Monument, the Kissing Couple, and Coke Ovens. The monument includes , much of which has been recommended to Congress for designation as wilderness. {\\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"000fff\\", \\"marker-size\\": \\"medium\\"}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-108.686111, 39.0425] }} Park history The area was first explored by John Otto, who settled in Grand Junction in the early 20th century. Prior to Otto's arrival, many area residents believed the canyons to be inaccessible to humans. Otto began building trails on the plateau and into the canyons.Museum of Western Colorado. Grand Valley History, History Timeline. . Accessed 8-03-09 As word spread about his work, the Chamber of Commerce of Grand Junction sent a delegation to investigate. The delegation returned praising both Otto's work and the scenic beauty of the wilderness area, and the local newspaper began lobbying to make it a National Park. A bill was introduced and carried by the local Representatives to the U.S. Congress and Senate but a Congressional slowdown in the final months threatened the process. To ensure protection of the canyons President William Howard Taft (who had visited the area) stepped in and used the highest powers available to him via the Antiquities Act and presidential proclamation to declare the canyons as a national monument. Cyclists riding through one of the tunnels during the Tour of the Moon bicycle race on September 30, 2017 The area was established as Colorado National Monument on May 24, 1911. Otto was hired as the first park ranger, drawing a salary of $1 per month. For the next 16 years, he continued building and maintaining trails while living in a tent in the park. The park became more well known in the 1980s partly due to its inclusion as a stage of the major international bicycle race, the Coors Classic. The race through the park became known as \\"The Tour of the Moon\\", due to the spectacular landscapes the race passed through on Rim Rock Drive. The issue of national park status has arisen time and again, usually during bust cycles brought on by the Uranium industry and later oil and gas. As of June, 2014 Congressman Scott Tipton and Senator Mark Udall have carried the process closer to fruition than any other representatives since the initial effort in 1907. The two Representatives appointed an 18-member committee of locals to study the issue and learn the facts in 2011. After a ground swell of support from local residents and business owners, the Representatives then appointed a committee of five local residents to write draft legislation. The draft legislation was announced and released in early 2014. A public comment period on the draft legislation began soon after with an end date of June 29. Documentary producer Ken Burns (National Parks: America's Best Idea) weighed in of the effort, endorsing national park status for the Colorado National Monument. Burns compared the area to Seward, Alaska which overcame opposition to create Kenai Fjords National Park. Burns said Seward locals came to refer to Kenai Fjords National Park as a \\"permanent pipeline\\". Climate Ecologically, Colorado National Monument sits on a large area of high desert in Western Colorado, though under the K√∂ppen climate classification, it, like neighbouring Grand Junction, is temperate semi-arid. Summers are hot and dry while winters cold with some snow. Temperatures reach on 5.3 days, on 57 days, and remain at or below freezing on 13 days annually. Trails A view from the Canyon Rim Trail The Coke Ovens Overlook is one of the many picturesque views in the park The Monument contains many hiking trails, with lengths and difficulties to suit all tastes. Summer storms can cause flash floods as well as dangerous trail conditions. Rattlesnakes are found on the Monument, and rough terrain exists everywhere, but most trails are well-maintained. Winter cross-country skiing is occasionally possible on trails such as the Liberty Cap Trail. Serpents Trail, perhaps the most popular, follows the route of the original road to the top of the Monument. This trail is accessible by parking lots at both ends, both located off Rim Rock Drive. Serpents Trail is well-maintained and provides stunning views of both the Monument itself and the Grand Valley below. One of the shortest trails, also popular, is Devil's Kitchen. The trailhead is located near the eastern entrance of the park on Rim Rock Drive. This trail is about 1 mile long, and ends in a sandstone grotto. Devil's Kitchen trail is well suited for families with smaller children, as the hike is short and the \\"kitchen\\" itself provides plenty of opportunity for child- sized exploration. Liberty Cap trail starts from the valley floor and climbs to the rim of the Monument. Liberty Cap itself is an ancient sand dune, and provides a beautiful view of the Grand Valley. Corkscrew Trail, closed for many years but re-opened in mid-2006, branches off the Liberty Cap and skirts a small canyon and cliffs that cannot be seen from the valley floor. This trail, the only loop trail on the Monument, is about 3 miles long and features a less rigorous climb than Liberty Cap. Monument Canyon trail, also popular, follows Monument Canyon for about 5 miles. This trail is often hiked up-and- back, and provides close-up views of Independence Monument, the Colorado National Monument's most distinct feature, as well as a formation named Kissing Couple. The lower trailhead is accessible from CO 340 (Broadway). No Thoroughfare Trail starts at the bottom of No Thoroughfare Canyon, near the east entrance. As the name implies, there is no official trail to the top of this canyon. The dead-end trail goes a few miles into the canyon, and up-and- back hiking is required. Some hikers have found a way to get through the entire canyon, but after a certain point the trail becomes difficult and unmarked. No Thoroughfare Canyon does have small waterfalls during the spring run-off, but is dry for most of the year. Colorado National Monument was rated in 2017 as the best campsite in Colorado in a 50-state survey conducted by Msn.com. Historic preservation Many of the early visitor facilities at Colorado National Monument were designed by the National Park Service and constructed by the Public Works Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. Several of these areas have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of this and in consequence of their adherence to the National Park Service Rustic design standards of the time. The entire Rim Rock Drive is a National Historic District, as well as the Serpents Trail, the Devils Kitchen Picnic Shelter, and three places in the Saddlehorn area: the Saddlehorn Caretaker's House and Garage, Saddlehorn Comfort Station, and the Saddlehorn Utility Area Historic District. The Visitor Center complex is also included as an example of the Mission 66 program. Geology The park's geologic record preserves three different groups of rock and sediment. The oldest rocks are Early to Middle Proterozoic gneiss and schist, including the Ute Canyon Stock. Overlying these, and separated by an angular unconformity, are mostly horizontally bedded Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, including the cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. Overlying these are various types of Quaternary unconsolidated deposits such as alluvium, colluvium, and dunes. The sedimentary rocks are folded into monoclines by several faults, including the Redlands Thrust Fault.Scott, R.B., Harding, A.E., Hood, W.C., Cole, R.D., Livaccari, R.F., Johnson, J.B., Shroba, R.R. and Dickerson, R.P., 2001, Geologic map of the Colorado National Monument and adjacent areas, Mesa County, Colorado: U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Investigations Series Map I-2740, scale 1:24000.

While the package continues to contain more and more possibilities for the calculation of many complex, real world problems, its origins and core-competency lie in highly nonlinear transient dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) using explicit time integration. LS-DYNA is used by the automobile, aerospace, construction and civil engineering, military, manufacturing, and bioengineering industries.  History  LS-DYNA originated from the 3D FEA program DYNA3D, developed by Dr. John O. Hallquist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1976. DYNA3D was created in order to simulate the impact of the Full Fusing Option (FUFO) or \\"Dial-a-yield\\" nuclear bomb for low altitude release (impact velocity of ~ 40 m/s). At the time, no 3D software was available for simulating impact, and 2D software was inadequate. Though the FUFO bomb was eventually canceled, development of DYNA3D continued. DYNA3D used explicit time integration to study nonlinear dynamic problems, with the original applications being mostly stress analysis of structures undergoing various types of impacts. The program was initially very simple largely due to the lack of adequate computational resources at the time. A two-dimensional version of the same software was developed concurrently. In 1978 the DYNA3D source code was released into the public domain without restrictions after a request from France. In 1979 a new version of DYNA3D was released which was programmed for optimal performance on the CRAY-1 supercomputers. This new release contained improved sliding interface treatment which was an order of magnitude faster than the previous contact treatment. This version also eliminated structural and higher order solid elements of the first version, while including element-wise integration of the integral difference method developed in 1974. The 1982 release included nine additional material models which allowed for new simulations, such as explosive-structure and soil- structure interactions. The release also permitted the analysis of structural response due to penetrating projectiles. Improvements in 1982 further boosted the execution speed by about 10 percent. Hallquist was the sole developer of DYNA3D until 1984, when he was joined by Dr. David J. Benson. In 1986, many capabilities were added. The added features included beams, shells, rigid bodies, single surface contact, interface friction, discrete springs and dampers, optional hourglass treatments, optional exact volume integration, and VAX/VMS, IBM, UNIX, COS operating system compatibility. At this point, DYNA3D became the first code to have a general single surface contact algorithm. Metal forming simulation and composite analysis capabilities were added to DYNA3D in 1987. This version included changes to the shell elements, and dynamic relaxation. The final release of DYNA3D in 1988 included several more elements and capabilities. By 1988 LLNL had sent approximately 600 tapes containing simulation software. Hallquist had consulted for nearly 60 companies and organizations on the use of DYNA3D. As a result, at the end of 1988 Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC) was founded to continue the development of DYNA3D in a much more focused manner, resulting in LS- DYNA3D (later shortened to LS-DYNA). Releases and support for DYNA3D were thus halted. Since then, LSTC has greatly expanded the capabilities of LS-DYNA in an attempt to create a universal tool for most simulation needs. In 2019, LSTC was acquired by Ansys, Inc.  Typical uses  Nonlinear means at least one (and sometimes all) of the following complications: * Changing boundary conditions (such as contact between parts that changes over time) * Large deformations (for example the crumpling of sheet metal parts) * Nonlinear materials that do not exhibit ideally elastic behavior (for example thermoplastic polymers) Transient dynamic means analyzing high speed, short duration events where inertial forces are important. Typical uses include: * Automotive crash (deformation of chassis, airbag inflation, seatbelt tensioning, ...) * Explosions (underwater mines, shaped charges, ...) * Manufacturing (sheet metal stamping, ...)  Characteristics  LS-DYNA consists of a single executable file and is entirely command-line driven. Therefore, all that is required to run LS-DYNA is a command shell, the executable, an input file, and enough free disk space to run the calculation. All input files are in simple ASCII format and thus can be prepared using any text editor. Input files can also be prepared with the aid of a graphical preprocessor. There are many third-party software products available for preprocessing LS-DYNA input files. LSTC also develops its own preprocessor, LS-PrePost, which is freely distributed and runs without a license. Licensees of LS-DYNA automatically have access to all of the program's capabilities, from simple linear static mechanical analysis up to advanced thermal and flow solving methods.

A heterosexual couple typically has the man presenting a ring or both exchanging rings, though women may present one as well. They may be worn on any finger due to not being as serious as an engagement ring, though they are sometimes worn on a necklace. These rings are typically purchased by those who are too young to get engaged to their partner or by a partner or partners who do not want to rush into marriage. While similar concepts have been employed in the past, the concept of pre-engagement rings came into prominence starting in the 1970s. It gained further prominence in the late 2000s when celebrities began to use pre-engagement rings (as well as purity rings) such as the Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez, and Priyanka Chopra. Appearance Designs of pre- engagement rings may vary, featuring hearts, an entangled design, and other designs. However, any design can be used for a pre-engagement ring. The bands may be made of a variety of materials, including titanium, silver, and gold. Less common inexpensive materials may be used, such as wood, glass, ceramic, bone, and plastic. Birthstones are also commonly used. The ring or rings may be engraved with one or both of the names of those in the relationship, and potentially their nickname(s). Custom A pre-engagement ring, sometimes referred to as a friendship ring or promise ring, is given to a romantic partner as a show of a commitment to a monogamous relationship as a precursor to an engagement ring.Philip-Phiri, Richard (2009). How to Grow Up the Right Way: Enter and Remain in Marriage. AuthorHouse.Seleshanko, Kristina (2009). Carry Me Over the Threshold. Zondervan. It advised to be given only after about six months to a year of a relationship. In a heterosexual couple, the man is typically the one to give the ring, though it is not uncommon for the woman to give as well. Some couples may also exchange pre-engagement rings. They can be worn on any finger, but those symbolizing pre-engagement rings are generally worn on the left ring finger. When a person gets married, if they still have their pre-engagement ring, they may switch the ring to their right ring finger. Because it is not an official engagement, the ring may be worn on any finger. It is also not uncommon for someone to wear a pre-engagement ring on a necklace. They are considered more of a fashion accessory than an engagement or wedding ring are. Costs for pre-engagement rings are almost always cheaper than an engagement ring due to the lower commitment and age of the giver and recipient. Pre-engagement rings are often worn by people who are too young to actually get engaged but with to commit to their relationship. However, they may also be used by couples who do not wish to rush into marriage. Pre-engagement rings are common in Brazil, and are sometimes worn by couples while they are dating. It is called a commitment ring (or anel de compromisso). History A Claddagh ring Similar concepts to pre-engagement rings have appeared at various points in history. One such example is posy rings, which were engraved with romantic poems in 16th century England. Another example were acrostic rings, which spelled out a word in gemstones such as \\"regard\\" using a ruby, emerald, garnet, amethyst, another ruby, and a diamond. Claddagh rings are another similar kind of ring. The term 'promise ring' entered the \\"jewelry dictionary\\" in the 1970s. Impact Priyanka Chopra Pre-engagement rings entered prominence in the late 2000s and early 2010s. One of the reasons for the increased prominence is the use by celebrities, including the Jonas Brothers, Jordin Sparks, Teyana Taylor, and Selena Gomez. Some companies have made franchise-branded pre-engagement rings, such as Disney's Beauty and the Beast-branded promise rings. The rings feature Belle and 'Her Beast' on the man's ring and Beast and 'His Beauty' on the woman's. Writer Nicole Fabian-Weber mocked the concept of pre-engagement rings in an article about Justin Bieber's gift of a pre-engagement ring to then- girlfriend Selena Gomez. Writer Pascale Day expressed bemusement at the idea of a pre-engagement ring. She expressed confusion as to what it was and commented that 'pre-engagement' is just \\"being in a relationship.\\" Writer Ana Gabriela Verotti Farah commented that due to the relative newness of the custom in Brazil in 2003, it resulted in trivialization by couples, especially young ones.

During the Cold War, this convention was disregarded. Thus the North Vietnamese General Offensive, General Uprising of 1968 became known in the West as the Tet Offensive. Returning to the previous convention, the 1972 Spring offensive has returned to its correct designation. This conventional invasion (the largest offensive operation since 300,000 Chinese troops had crossed the Yalu River into North Korea during the Korean War) was a radical departure from previous North Vietnamese offensives. The offensive was designed to achieve a decisive victory, which even if it did not lead to the collapse of South Vietnam, would greatly improve the North's negotiating position at the Paris Peace Accords. The U.S. high command had been expecting an attack in 1972 but the size and ferocity of the assault caught the defenders off balance, because the attackers struck on three fronts simultaneously, with the bulk of the North Vietnamese army. This first attempt by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to invade the south since the Tet Offensive of 1968, became characterized by conventional infantry‚Äìarmor assaults backed by heavy artillery, with both sides fielding the latest in technological advances in weapons systems. In the I Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese forces overran South Vietnamese defensive positions in a month-long battle and captured Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã city, before moving south in an attempt to seize Hu·∫ø. PAVN similarly eliminated frontier defense forces in the II Corps Tactical Zone and advanced to seize the provincial capital of Kon Tum, threatening to open a way to the sea, which would have split South Vietnam in two. North-east of Saigon, in the III Corps Tactical Zone, PAVN forces overran L·ªôc Ninh and advanced to assault the capital of B√¨nh Long Province at An L·ªôc. The campaign can be divided into three phases: April was a month of PAVN advances; May became a period of equilibrium; in June and July the South Vietnamese forces counter-attacked, culminating in the recapture of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City in September. On all three fronts, initial North Vietnamese successes were hampered by high casualties, inept tactics and the increasing application of U.S. and South Vietnamese air power. One result of the offensive was the launching of Operation Linebacker, the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam by the U.S. since November 1968. Although South Vietnamese forces withstood their greatest trial thus far in the conflict, the North Vietnamese accomplished two important goals: they had gained valuable territory within South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives and they had obtained a better bargaining position at the peace negotiations being conducted in Paris. Background Planning In the wake of the failed South Vietnamese Operation Lam Son 719, the Hanoi leadership began discussing a possible offensive during the 19th Plenum of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party in early 1971. Convinced that they had destroyed South Vietnam's best units during Lam Son 719, by December, the Politburo had decided to launch a major offensive early in the following year. 1972 would be a U.S. presidential election year, and the possibility of affecting the outcome was enticing and there was increasing anti-war sentiment among the population and government of the U.S.Palmer, pp. 310‚Äì311. With American troop withdrawals, South Vietnamese forces were stretched to breaking point along a border of more than and the poor performance of ARVN troops in the offensive into Laos promised an easy victory. This decision marked the end of three years of political infighting between two factions within the Politburo: those members grouped around Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh, who favored following the Chinese model of continued low-intensity guerrilla warfare and rebuilding the north and the \\"southern firsters\\" around Defense Minister V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, supported by First Party Secretary L√™ Du·∫©n (both of whom supported the Soviet model of big offensives).Andrade, pp. 36‚Äì37. The failure of the Tet Offensive of 1968, had led to a downgrading of Giap's influence but the victory achieved over South Vietnamese forces during the Laotian incursion, brought Giap's strategy back into the ascendant. L√™ Du·∫©n was given responsibility for planning the operation but Giap never rose to his former prominence, dealing chiefly with logistical matters and the approval of operational planning.Fulghum and Maitland, p. 122. The officer entrusted with the conduct of the offensive was the PAVN chief of staff, General VƒÉn Ti·∫øn D≈©ng. The central questions then became where and with what forces the offensive would be launched and what its goals were to be. North Vietnam had used the border regions of Laos and Cambodia as supply and manpower conduits for a decade and a demilitarized zone that separated the two Vietnams. There, the line of communication would be shortest and forces could be concentrated where \\"the enemy is weakest...violent attacks will disintegrate enemy forces...making it impossible for him to have enough troops to deploy elsewhere.\\" This was an important consideration, since the northern thrust would serve to divert South Vietnamese attention and resources, while two other attacks were to be launched: one into the central highlands, to cut the country in two and another eastwards from Cambodia to threaten Saigon. Republic of Vietnam: Corps Tactical Zones The offensive was given a title steeped in Vietnamese history. In 1773, the three T√¢y S∆°n brothers (so-called because of the place of their origin) united a Vietnam divided by civil war and social unrest. The youngest brother, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá, then defeated an invading Chinese army on the outskirts of Hanoi in 1788. The campaign eventually employed the equivalent of 14 divisions. There was the distinct possibility of destroying or at least crippling large elements of the ARVN; possibly deposing of South Vietnamese President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu; convincing the U.S. as to the hopelessness of continued support to the South and demonstrating the failure of Vietnamization. The prospect of seizing a South Vietnamese provincial capital, which could then be proclaimed as the seat of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, was also enticing.Andrade, p. 43. The attitude of the North Vietnamese leadership was illustrated in an article in a 1972 party journal: \\"It doesn't matter whether the war is promptly ended or prolonged...Both are opportunities to sow the seeds; all we have to do is to wait for the time to harvest the crop.\\" The northern leadership was taken aback during the summer of 1971, when an announcement was made that U.S. President Richard Nixon would visit the People's Republic of China, on a diplomatic mission before May 1972. The Chinese placated the suspicions of their ally, by reassuring North Vietnam that even more military and economic aid would be forthcoming in 1972. The Soviet Union, perceiving the growing antagonism between the People's Republic and North Vietnam, sought to widen the rift by also agreeing to \\"additional aid without reimbursement\\", for North Vietnam's military forces.At the time, it was assumed that the Soviet Union was supplying the bulk of North Vietnam's military needs but of the $1.5 billion in military aid sent to North Vietnam between 1970‚Äì1972, two-thirds came from China.Fulghum and Maitland, p. 120. These agreements led to a flood of equipment and supplies necessary for a modern, conventional army. This included 400 T-34, T-54 and Type 59 (a Chinese version of the T-54) medium and 200 PT-76 light amphibious tanks, hundreds of anti-aircraft missiles, including the shoulder-fired, heat-seeking SA-7 Strela (called the Grail in the West), anti-tank missiles, including the wire-guided AT-3 Sagger and heavy-caliber, long-range artillery. To man the new equipment, 25,000 North Vietnamese troops received specialized training abroad, 80 percent of them in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe.More than 3,000 PAVN tank crews received training at the Soviet armor school in Odessa, in the USSR. A contingent of high-level Soviet military personnel also arrived in Vietnam and stayed until March 1972 in preparation for the offensive. Miscalculation During late 1971, U.S. and South Vietnamese intelligence estimates of communist intentions were mixed. An offensive was expected, but intelligence as to its timing, location, and size were confusing. The communists had mounted the Tet Offensive in 1968, but it had been conducted mainly by Vietcong (VC) in the initial phase, which had been destroyed in the process. Without VC support, a large-scale PAVN offensive was considered highly unlikely. A PAVN thrust across the DMZ was also considered unlikely. Past infiltration and offensive operations had been conducted through and from Laotian and Cambodian territory and a DMZ offensive would be a blatant violation of the Geneva Agreement, which North Vietnam was adamant in defending. In December, intelligence became conclusive that PAVN units supporting Khmer Rouge operations in Cambodia began returning to the border areas. In Laos and Cambodia, there was also an unusual expansion of infiltration. In North Vietnam, there was a noticeable increase in military recruitment. In January, Defense Intelligence Agency officers briefed Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird to state that PAVN would attack after the T·∫øt holidays and that the offensive would involve th widespread use of armored forces.Andrade, p. 27. Laird was unconvinced and told the U.S. Congress in late January that a large communist offensive \\"was not a serious possibility\\"Andrade, p. 28. U.S. and South Vietnamese intelligence services had no consensus as to communist intentions, but Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), was suspicious and sent several reconnaissance teams into the M·ª• Gi·∫° and Ban Karai Pass areas and discovered a buildup of PAVN forces and equipment. MACV then decided that the North Vietnamese were preparing for an offensive in the central highlands and the northern provinces of South Vietnam. The brunt of an attack would be borne by South Vietnamese forces since the U.S. strength had been reduced to 69,000 troops, most of whom were in support roles and the number was to be reduced to 27,000 by 30 November.Nalty, p. 348. The U.S. commander, General Creighton W. Abrams, was convinced an offensive was likely but was also convinced that the attack would begin during or near the T·∫øt holidays, at the beginning of the year. He notified Admiral Thomas Moorer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the North Vietnamese might attempt to \\"duplicate the effects of the 1968 offensive, perhaps by a limited operation aimed less at inflicting defeat on the battlefield than in influencing American public opinion.\\"Nalty, p. 326. The consensus at MACV was that such an offensive would be launched against II Corps, in the Central Highlands. When the offensive did not occur, he and his headquarters were ridiculed in the American press for crying wolf.Andrade, p. 238.Life magazine, 24 March 1972. The moment of crisis seemed to have passed, and by the end of March, allied forces that had been standing by had returned to pacification efforts.Palmer, p. 316. U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker left for Nepal, and General Abrams went to Thailand to spend the Easter holiday with his family. The Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 The ARVN units upon which the initial North Vietnamese attack was to fall included the 1st and 3rd Divisions in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Th·ª´a Thi√™n Provinces and the 2nd Division, further south. The force was supplemented by two brigades of Marines (the 147th and 258th), the 51st Infantry Regiment, the 1st Ranger Group and Regional and Popular Forces, approximately 30,000 men.Andrade, p. 46. The units were in static defensive positions and lacked adequate mobile reserves.Andrade, p. 47. Bearing the initial brunt of the attack would be the 3rd Division, which had been created in October 1971 and was located in an arc of outposts near the DMZ, to replace departing American troops. To create the new unit, the 1st Division (arguably ARVN's best unit) was stripped of its 2nd Regiment and the 11th Armored Cavalry was brought up from the I Corps reserve. Both units were experienced, well-trained, well-equipped, and well-led. The 3rd Division's other two regiments, the 56th and 57th were made up of recaptured deserters, men released from jail, and regional and provincial forces.Andrade, p. 49. That contention was challenged by General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng as false. Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 18. It was led by cast-off officers and sergeants from other units. Like other ARVN units at this stage of the conflict, the division suffered from a dearth of American advisors, who then served only at regimental, brigade, and divisional headquarters. Because of the general belief that the North Vietnamese would not violate the sacrosanct boundary, the unit was stationed in the relatively \\"safe\\" area directly below the DMZ. The division was commanded by newly-promoted Brigadier General Vu Van Giai, the former deputy commander of the 1st Division. The I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Ho√†ng Xu√¢n L√£m, was an officer who epitomized the indecision and the ineffectiveness of Saigon's command structure, as had been discovered all too blatantly during Operation Lam Son 719. Lam concentrated on administrative matters and left tactical decisions to his subordinate commanders. Considering the circumstances, that was a workable solution only as long as his division commanders encountered no major difficulties. U.S. intelligence had been squabbling over a possible PAVN attack across the DMZ attack during the months preceding the offensive. DIA analysts \\"cautiously\\" predicted such a contingency, but the CIA downplayed the possibility. General Lam's American advisors agreed with his assessment that a blatant North Vietnamese violation of the Geneva Accord was unlikely.Andrade, pp. 67‚Äì68. When the weekend of Easter 1972 arrived, General Giai had planned to rotate the operational areas of his 56th Regiment (along the central DMZ) with the 2nd Regiment (around the artillery base at Camp Carroll in the west). Because of a truck shortage, the units were moved simultaneously and became hopelessly intermixed and disorganized. At 11:30 on 30 March, both unit headquarters shut down their radios, for the exchange of operational areas.Andrade, p. 52. With communications fragmented, its units entangled, and the weather bad enough to prevent aerial operations, the 3rd Division offered the massed PAVN forces to the north an irresistible target.Fulghum and Maitland, p. 129. Offensive I Corps ‚Äì Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã PAVN 122mm artillery battery goes into action on the Kon Tum front The offensive began at noon on 30 March 1972, when an intense artillery barrage rained down on the northernmost ARVN outposts in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. Two PAVN divisions (the 304th and 308th ‚Äì approximately 30,000 troops) supported by more than 100 tanks (in 2 Regiments) then rolled over the Demilitarized Zone to attack I Corps, the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese 308th Division and two independent regiments assaulted the \\"ring of steel\\", the arc of ARVN firebases just south of the DMZ. From the west, the 312th, including an armoured regiment, moved out of Laos along Route 9, past Khe Sanh, and into the Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã River Valley. Significantly, allied intelligence had failed to predict both the scale of the offensive and the method of attack, giving PAVN \\"the inestimable benefit of shock effect, a crucial psychological edge over defenders who had expected something quite different.\\" PAVN offensive in I Corps On 1 April, South Vietnamese General Giai, ordered a withdrawal of the 3rd Division south of the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River in order for his troops to reorganize. The following morning, ARVN armoured elements held off a PAVN offensive briefly when the crucial Highway QL-1 bridge over the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River at ƒê√¥ng H√† was blown up by Capt. John Ripley, adviser to the 3rd Vietnamese Marine Battalion. The initial PAVN units were then joined by the 320B and 325C Divisions. Simultaneously, the 324B Division moved out of the A S·∫ßu Valley and advanced directly eastward toward Fire Bases Bastogne and Checkmate, which protected the old imperial capital of Hu·∫ø from the west. The North Vietnamese advance had been timed to coincide with the seasonal monsoon, whose cloud ceilings negated many U.S. airstrikes.This situation was exacerbated by the attempt to rescue Air Force officer Lt Col Iceal Hambleton (\\"Bat-21\\"), who had been shot down on the 2nd by a surface-to-air missile behind PAVN lines. During the 12-day attempt to rescue him, a no-bombing/no-shelling zone was imposed south and west of the Cam Lo River, a tragic decision for the 3rd Division. Andrade, pp. 94‚Äì95. PAVN advance elements were soon followed by anti-aircraft units armed with new ZSU-57-2 tracked weapon platforms and man-portable, shoulder-fired Grail missiles, which made low-level bombing attacks hazardous. Camp Carroll, an artillery firebase halfway between the Laotian border and the coast, was the linchpin of the South Vietnamese northern and western defense line and was the strongest obstacle to the North Vietnamese before Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City. On 2 April, Colonel Pham Van Dinh, commander of the 56th ARVN Regiment, surrendered the camp and his 1,500 troops with barely a shot being fired.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 30. Later in the day, ARVN troops abandoned Mai Loc, the last western base. This allowed North Vietnamese forces to cross the Cam L·ªô bridge, 11 kilometers to the west of ƒê√¥ng H√†. PAVN then had almost unrestricted access to western Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province north of the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. ARVN M-48 tanks are positioned near the Dong Ha River overlooking QL-9 during the Easter Offensive, 10 April 1972 On 21 April, Abrams notified the U.S. Secretary of Defense that > In summary...the pressure is mounting and the battle has become brutal...the > senior military leadership has begun to bend and in some cases to break. In > adversity, it is losing its will and cannot be depended upon to take the > measures necessary to stand and fight.Sorley, p. 330. The PAVN advance was slowed by delaying actions for three weeks, and the South Vietnamese launched several counterattacks, but on the morning of 27 April, the North Vietnamese came on again, launching multi-pronged attacks against ƒê√¥ng H√† (which fell on the following day) and advancing to within 1.5 kilometers of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City. General Giai had planned a staged withdrawal from the city to consolidate south of the Th·∫°ch H√£n, but bewildered by conflicting orders from L√£m and Giai, most ARVN formations splintered and then collapsed, conceding most of the province north of the city.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 38. See also Fulghum and Maitland, pp. 145‚Äì147. For those units that did not fall apart, see ibid., p. 147. For L√£m's culpability, see Andrade, p. 150. On 29 April, Giai ordered a general retreat to the My Chanh River, thirteen kilometers to the south. U.S. military advisors in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã called for emergency helicopter extraction and, on 1 May 132 survivors were evacuated from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, including 80 U.S. soldiers. The exodus of ARVN forces was joined by tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians fleeing from the fighting. As the mass of humanity jostled and shoved its way south on Highway 1, it presented an inviting target for North Vietnamese artillerists.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 45‚Äì46. They were soon joined by PAVN infantry, who moved by the flank to attack the column. ARVN units, with no leadership and all unit cohesion gone, could muster no defense. Meanwhile, to the west, Fire Support Bases Bastogne and Checkmate had fallen after staunch ARVN defense and massive B-52 bomber strikes, which inflicted heavy casualties.Sorley, p. 329. Giai evacuated the last of his forces from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City, which fell to PAVN forces on 2 May. That same day General Lam was summoned to Saigon for a meeting with President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu. He was relieved of command of I Corps and replaced by Lieutenant General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng, commander of IV Corps.Andrade, p. 171. Instead of sacking Lam for poor leadership, Thieu promoted the politically connected general to the Ministry of Defense. Tr∆∞·ªüng's mission was to defend Hu·∫ø, minimize further losses, and retake captured territory. Although saddled with raw troops and constantly countermanded by his superiors, General Giai had conducted a reasonably good defense. Even Tr∆∞·ªüng pleaded his case with Thi·ªáu, wanting to keep Giai in command of the 3rd Division.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 62, 166. It was in vain. Giai, who was to be made the scapegoat for the collapse, was tried for \\"desertion in the face of the enemy\\", and sentenced to five years in prison.Fulghum and Maitland, p. 150. I Corps ‚Äì Hu·∫ø South Vietnamese northern defense line Hoping to break the stalemate that was developing on the northern front, Lieutenant General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Quang, commander of the B-4 Front, attacked on 1 April west from the A Shau Valley toward Hu·∫ø with the 324B Division. Spoiling attacks by the ARVN 1st Division, however, threw off the timetable.Andrade, pp. 181‚Äì182. On 28 April 29 and 803rd PAVN Regiments seized Firebase Bastogne, the strongest anchor on Hu·∫ø's western flank.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 49. This made Firebase Checkmate untenable, and it too was evacuated that night. This exposed Hu·∫ø to a direct thrust along Route 547. On 2 May PAVN forces south of Hu·∫ø tried to surround the city.Andrade, p. 187. An ARVN outpost on the My Chanh Line, 2 May 1972 The PAVN also attempted to press their attack southward down Highway 1 and across the My Chanh River to Hu·∫ø, but, fortunately for the South Vietnamese, after Tr∆∞·ªüng took command, the 1st and Marine Divisions were reinforced by the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of the Airborne Division (which now totaled three brigades), and the reorganized 1st Ranger Group, raising the ARVN manpower total to 35,000.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 56‚Äì57.Andrade, p. 190. Also fortuitous was a one-week clearing of the weather, which allowed the application of massive U.S. bombing. The PAVN advance was halted on 5 May. I Corps ‚Äì Counteroffensive By mid-May, Tr∆∞·ªüng felt strong enough to go on the offensive in a series of limited attacks, feints, and raids codenamed Song Than (Tsunami) that were planned to throw the North Vietnamese off balance, enlarge the defensive perimeter around Hu·∫ø, and deny the enemy time and space to maneuver.Andrade, p. 198. Between 15 and 20 May, Firebases Bastogne and Checkmate were recaptured. PAVN forces then launched another attempt to take the city on 21 May, losing 18 tanks and approximately 800 men in the process. On 25 May a second North Vietnamese assault managed to cross the My Chanh River, but ARVN defenders put up ferocious resistance, forcing their enemy back across on 29 May.Lavalle, pp. 56‚Äì58. This was the last serious assault on the defenses of Hu·∫ø. Major General Frederick J. Kroesen, senior U.S. advisor in I Corps, believed that the fall of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã should have heralded the fall of Hu·∫ø, but the North Vietnamese did not exploit their opportunity quickly enough. \\"That he failed completely to take advantage of the moment must be classed as another great blunder of the Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã campaign.\\"Andrade, p. 176. By mid-June, clearing weather allowed more accurate aerial bombardment and shelling from U.S. warships offshore. On the 14th, Tr∆∞·ªüng briefed President Thi·ªáu and MACV on his planned counterattack to retake Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. Thi·ªáu was not convinced, preferring a smaller-scale operation.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 66. The persistent Tr∆∞·ªüng finally convinced the president, emphasizing that such an effort would be possible \\"employing the superior firepower of our American ally.\\"Nalty, p. 391. Thi·ªáu finally approved the concept. Tr∆∞·ªüng launched Operation Lam Son 72 on 28 June. The 1st Division continued its westward push toward Laos while the Airborne and Marine Divisions, the 1st Ranger Group, and the 7th Armored Cavalry moved north to retake Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. The Airborne Division led the way and, utilizing airmobile end-runs and the North Vietnamese were slowly levered out of their defensive positions.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 65. The division then advanced to the outskirts of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City within ten days, but then President Thieu intervened in the operation. Tr∆∞·ªüng had planned to bypass the city and push on quickly to the Cua Viet River, thereby isolating any PAVN defenders.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 67. Thi·ªáu, however, now demanded that Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã be taken immediately, seeing the city as \\"a symbol and a challenge\\" to his authority.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 89. It was not going to be an easy task for General Tr∆∞·ªüng. The ARVN assault bogged down in the outskirts and the North Vietnamese, apprised of the plans for the offensive, moved the 304th and 308th Divisions to the west to avoid the U.S. airpower that was about to be unleashed upon Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã.Andrade, pp. 211‚Äì213. The defense of the city and its walled citadel was left to PAVN replacement units and militia. One participant recalled : \\"The new recruits came in at dusk. They were dead by dawn... No one had time to check where they were from, or who was their commander.\\"Andrade, p. 213. Others described the defense as a \\"senseless sacrifice\\" and referred to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã as \\"Hamburger City\\". Nevertheless, the PAVN units stationed within the citadel were well dug in, had the advantage of terrain and mass artillery supports. An ARVN early victory was denied, and the fighting continue unabated. On 11 July, the ARVN Airborne Division and South Vietnamese Marines launched a heli-borne assault supported by U.S. Marine helicopter squadrons HMM-164, HMM-165 and U.S. Army's Troop F, 4th Cavalry north and east of the city which would cut the last remaining road and force the PAVN to reinforce and resupply across the Thach Han River, making them vulnerable to air strikes. After a vicious, three-day battle against the 48th Regiment of the 320B PAVN Division broke and withdrew.Fulghum and Maitland, pp. 178‚Äì180. On 27 July, the ARVN Marine Division was ordered to relieve the Airborne units as the lead element in the battle. But progress was slow, consisting of vicious house-to-house fighting and incessant artillery barrages by both sides. In September, the final assault to capture the heavily defended citadel was launched; it was finally taken on 16 September. Tr∆∞·ªüng's forces then advanced to the southern bank of the Thach Han River, where they halted, exhausted and depleted by heavy casualties and unable to push on to ƒê√¥ng H√†.Almost one out of every four of the 8,000 ARVN Marines in the division had been killed or wounded during Lam Son 72. Andrade, p. 226. During July, American aircraft flew 5,461 tactical sorties and 2,054 B-52 strikes and operated 5 aircraft carriers to support the counteroffensive.Andrade, p. 212. III Corps ‚Äì An L·ªôc PAVN offensive in III Corps The initial wave of the offensive was followed on 5 April by a PAVN advance out of Cambodia into B√¨nh Long Province, northeast of Saigon. Its targets were the towns and airfields at L·ªôc Ninh, Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i, and An L·ªôc. The possible initial goals of the offensive in III Corps remain unclear, but probably began as probes that, if successful, could be easily reinforced.Andrade, p. 373. The invasion was launched from Cambodian Base Area 708 by the B-2 Front's 5th PAVN/VC Division and 203rd Armoured Regiment, which advanced down Highway 9 toward the border outpost of Loc Ninh. There, the 2,000 men of the ARVN 9th Regiment and a battalion of Rangers beat back five separate infantry/armor assaults before collapsing under the attack on 7 April.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 115. The North Vietnamese then isolated the 25th Division in neighboring T√¢y Ninh Province by sending two regiments to attack its forward outposts. Sensing that the provincial capital of An L·ªôc would be the next target, the III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Minh dispatched the 5th Division to hold the town. They were reinforced by two battalions of the Ranger Group (on 7 April) and by two additional infantry battalions (on 10 and 11 April).Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 116. The 21st Division, which had been stationed in the Mekong Delta, was rushed to Ch∆°n Th√†nh Camp to join a regiment of the 9th Division as a relief force. All forces in the area were placed under the command of Brigadier General L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞ng, commander of the 5th Division.On 30 April 1975, L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞ng, \\"the hero of An L·ªôc\\", committed suicide rather than surrender to victorious PAVN forces. The move was fortuitous for the South Vietnamese, since PAVN forces were indeed proceeding eastward toward An L·ªôc. Simultaneously, the PAVN 7th Division bypassed the town and moved south along Highway 13 to block any relief effort launched from Ch∆°n Th√†nh. The North Vietnamese had decided that An L·ªôc, with its close proximity to Saigon, would be proclaimed as the capital of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, but even if they had been able to seize the town, they would never have been able to hold it. American air power would have made such an eventuality impossible. ARVN soldier with M72 LAW anti-tank rockets during the defense of An L·ªôc By 13 April, An L·ªôc was surrounded and under a combined artillery, armored, and infantry attack by the 9th PAVN/VC Division. PAVN forces advanced on the town through a deluge rockets, bombs, and napalm delivered by U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft supported by massed artillery, tank, and small arms fire. Inside the town, the contingent of U.S. advisors became essential to the defense, serving as a separate staff organizing fire and air support, logistics, and intelligence. Colonel William Miller, the senior U.S. advisor, was not happy with General Hung's continuous reluctance to launch counterattacks and his reliance on U.S. air power to defeat the North Vietnamese. His hesitation and lack of motivation prompted Miller to report that: \\"He is tired ‚Äì unstable ‚Äì irrational ‚Äì irritable ‚Äì inadvisable ‚Äì and unapproachable.\\"Andrade, p. 439. The attacks persisted and PAVN forces eventually battered their way into the town, seizing the airfield and reducing the ARVN perimeter to about a square kilometer. During another assault on the 21st, PAVN tanks actually forced their way through the defense perimeter but were held at bay and then destroyed by anti-tank weapons and helicopter gunships. PAVN infantry did, however, manage to seize most of the northern sector of the town, where they began digging in (often right across the street from the ARVN defenders). The initial shock of ARVN troops instilled by North Vietnamese armor was soon abated when they discovered that, because the supporting infantry failed to advance with the tanks, they became easy prey for anti-tank weapons.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 119. On other occasions, the opposite would occur, with massed infantry assaults moving forward without armored support. This failure of tactical coordination was one of PAVN's prime weaknesses during the offensive, and one that the allies were quick to exploit. North Vietnamese T-54 tank knocked out in An L·ªôc by U.S. Army AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship As a result of his failure to seize the town quickly, the commander of the 9th Division was officially reprimanded and local command was handed over the senior officer of the 5th PAVN/VC Division.Fulghum and Maitland, p. 153. Besides the lack of coordination, the major difficulty for the PAVN was the rain of ordnance delivered upon them by incessant air strikes, which further reduced manpower and made resupply difficult. After the failure of the assault on 21 April, the battle devolved into a siege, with the North Vietnamese pounding An L·ªôc and its defenders with 1,200 to 2,000 mortar, rocket, and artillery rounds per day.Lavalle, p. 86. An L·ªôc was completely surrounded and could only be resupplied by air, a situation made more difficult by the loss of the airfield. Resupply was accomplished, however, by 448 aerial missions which managed to deliver 2,693 tons of air-dropped food, medical supplies, and ammunition,Momyer, p. 50. supported by the US Army's \\"549th QM (AD)\\" (QuarterMaster, Air Delivery) Rigger Company, which had been rapid-deployed from Okinawa in early April. From 22 April to 10 May, the tactical situation remained stable at what the Paris Match was calling \\"a Verdun or a Stalingrad\\" in III Corps.Paris Match, 5 July 1972. On the morning of 11 May, another PAVN assault was launched after being preceded by an artillery bombardment that fired over 8,300 shells into a defense perimeter that had shrunk to a mere by before the day was over.Andrade, p. 472. PAVN forces again forced their way into An L·ªôc, but the effort collapsed in the face of tremendous aerial attack, which cost the North Vietnamese 40 tanks and over 800 men.Momyer, p. 47. The reasons for the failure were not hard to discern. Beginning at 05:30 that morning and continuing for the next 25 hours, the U.S. Air Force delivered a B-52 strike every 55 minutes to support the defense. For the next three days, each time PAVN troops assembled to resume the attack, they were bombed in their assembly areas. The climactic attack on An L·ªôc was launched on 14 May, when the North Vietnamese attacked directly into the teeth of the ARVN defense. The failed assault was described by Colonel Walt Ulmer, the 5th Division's senior advisor: \\"they were simply trying to pile on and pile on and pile on. They frittered away an awful lot of manpower.\\"Fulghum and Maitland, p. 154. A relief effort had been launched by the 21st ARVN Division, but it never arrived at An L·ªôc. For three weeks the division crept northward along Highway 13 but it was held up by constant delaying actions by smaller PAVN forces. Although the division never reached its goal, it inadvertently supported the beleaguered city by eventually diverting almost all of the elements of the 7th PAVN Division from the fighting. Although North Vietnamese forces remained in the area and continued to shell An L·ªôc heavily, the impetus of their offensive was over. By 12 June, the last PAVN forces were driven from the city and its environs and over 1,000 ARVN wounded were evacuated.Lavalle, p. 104. Slowly, the decimated North Vietnamese units faded away to the north and west as others covered their withdrawal. On 18 June, the headquarters of III Corps declared the siege to be over. The Saigon government claimed that 12,500 South Vietnamese soldiers had been killed or wounded at An L·ªôc. American sources claimed that 25,000 PAVN or NLF troops had been killed or wounded during the action, although those numbers could never be confirmed.Andrade, pp. 499‚Äì500. II Corps ‚Äì Kon Tum The objective of PAVN forces during the third phase of the Nguyen Hue Offensive was to seize the cities of Kon Tum and Pleiku, thereby overrunning the Central Highlands. This would then open the possibility of proceeding east to the coastal plains, splitting South Vietnam in two. The highlands offensive was preceded by VC diversionary operations that opened on 5 April in coastal B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, which aimed at closing Highway 1, seizing several ARVN firebases, and diverting South Vietnamese forces from operations further west. North Vietnamese forces, under the command of Lieutenant General Hoang Minh Thao, commander of the B-3 Front, included the 320th and 2nd PAVN Divisions in the highlands and the 3rd PAVN Division in the lowlands ‚Äì approximately 50,000 men.Andrade, p. 241. PAVN offensive in II Corps Arrayed against them in II Corps were the ARVN 22nd and 23rd Divisions, two armored cavalry squadrons, and the 2nd Airborne Brigade, all under the command of Lieutenant General Ng√¥ Du. It had become evident as early as January that the North Vietnamese were building up for offensive operations in the tri-border region and numerous B-52 strikes had been conducted in the area in hopes of slowing the build-up. ARVN forces had also been deployed forward toward the border in order to slow the PAVN advance and allow the application of airpower to deplete North Vietnamese manpower and logistics. The B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh offensive, however, threw General Du into a panic and almost convinced him to fall for the North Vietnamese ploy and divert his forces from the highlands. John Paul Vann, director of the U.S. Second Regional Assistance Group, reassured Du that it was only a ruse and to remain ready for the main blow, which he was convinced would come from western Laos.Andrade, p. 252. Vann, although a civilian, had been granted the unique authority to command all U.S. military advisors within his region.A civilian official had never before in American history assumed the position of a general and commanded U.S. military forces in the field during wartime. Sheehan, p. 749. A retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel with ten years of experience in Vietnam, Vann had become notorious for his outspoken criticism of both his superiors and the U.S. conduct of the war after his arrival in South Vietnam in 1962, and had been forced to resign his Army commission. Almost a decade after leaving the U.S. military under a personal and professional cloud, Vann had risen to the equivalent rank of general. Vann worked day and night, using his extensive civilian and military contacts to channel U.S. support (especially air support) to the region. Major General John Hill, Du's senior military advisor, described Vann's extraordinary actions: \\"The rest of us organized around Vann's personal efforts and concentrated on getting the resources marshalled to take advantage of the leadership he was exerting with the Vietnamese.\\"Fulghum and Maitland, p. 156. John Paul Vann and his staff at their Pleiku headquarters To counter the possible threat from the west, Du had deployed two regiments of the 22nd Division to T√¢n C·∫£nh and ƒê·∫Øk T√¥ Base Camp and two armored squadrons to Ben Het.The forward deployment of the division had actually been Vann's idea. Although Du would not always do as Vann wanted, he did so enough times for the more xenophobic members of his staff to mock him as \\"the slave of John Paul Vann.\\" Sheehan, p. 759. On 12 April, the 2nd PAVN Division, elements of the 203rd Tank Regiment, and several independent regiments of the B-3 Front attacked the outpost at Tan Canh and the nearby ƒê·∫Øk T√¥ base. When the ARVN armor moved out of Ben Het toward ƒê·∫Øk T√¥, it was ambushed and destroyed. The overwhelmed South Vietnamese defense northwest of Kon Tum quickly disintegrated, placing the command of III Corps in a quandary. With the remainder of the 22nd Division covering the coast there were few forces left to defend the provincial capital of Kon Tum. The North Vietnamese southern advance inexplicably halted for three crucial weeks. While the northern crisis waned, however, General Du began to unravel, finding it increasingly difficult to make decisions. Vann gave up all pretext of South Vietnamese command, took over himself, and openly issued orders. He placed responsibility for the defense of the city of Kon Tum on the shoulders of Colonel Ly Tong Ba, commander of the 23rd Division.Andrade, p. 286. It was indicative of the ARVN command structure that Ba, a skilled and aggressive commander with few political connections, was the only divisional commander of such low rank. Vann then used massive B-52 strikes to hold the North Vietnamese at arm's length and reduce their numbers while he managed to find additional troops with which to stabilize the situation. By 14 May, North Vietnamese forces had reached Kon Tum and launched their main assault. The 320th PAVN Division, the 1st and 141st Regiments of the 2nd PAVN Division, and elements of the 203rd Tank Regiment attacked the city from the north, south, and west. By the time of the assault, the city mustered a defensive force that consisted of the 23rd Division and several Ranger groups. Their three-week delay cost the North Vietnamese dearly. By 14 May, the worst of the fighting in I and II Corps was over and a majority of the B-52s were free to concentrate on the Central Highlands.It was not uncommon for Vann to lobby hard to obtain 21 of the 25 B-52 flights coming into South Vietnam every day. Between 14 May and 7 June, approximately 300 B-52 strikes were conducted in the environs of Kon Tum. Sheehan, p. 783. During the North Vietnamese attack, the positions of the 44th and 45th ARVN Regiments crumbled and were overrun, but a well-placed B-52 strike landed directly on the PAVN attackers at the point of the breakthrough. The next morning, when the South Vietnamese returned to their former positions unopposed, 400 bodies were discovered, along with seven destroyed tanks.Andrade, p. 322. At Vann's insistence, a personnel shake-up took place in III Corps when President Thieu replaced Du with Major General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n, whose outwardly confident and assertive nature was the complete opposite of Du's.To√†n, one of South Vietnam's most undistinguished officers, had been General Lam's assistant operations officer in I Corps during the opening phase of the offensive and had no wish to follow his former commander into ignominy. He assumed administrative control and conceded all command functions to Vann and Ba. Andrade, p. 313. The actions at Kon Tum for the following two weeks became characterized by massed PAVN assaults that were lashed by B-52, tactical air, and helicopter gunship attacks. ARVN troops then counterattacked over the remains of the attacking wave. On 26 May, four North Vietnamese regiments supported by armored forces managed to punch a hole in the defense, but their advance was halted by U.S. helicopters firing the new TOW missiles. During the following three days of fighting, 24 North Vietnamese T-54 tanks were destroyed by TOWs and the breach was sealed.85 TOWs were fired in combat during the offensive, only ten of which were counted as misses. Andrade, p. 318. With the aid of the U.S. and Republic of Vietnam Air Forces and despite severe losses, ARVN managed to hold Kon Tum during the remainder of the battle. Aerial resupply was supported by the US Army's \\"549th QM (AD)\\" (QuarterMaster, Air Delivery) Rigger Company, which had been rapid-deployed from Okinawa in early April. By early June, the PAVN faded back to the west, leaving behind over 4,000 dead on the battlefield.Andrade, p. 356. It was estimated by U.S. intelligence that total PAVN casualties in the Central Highlands during the offensive totaled between 20,000 and 40,000 troops.Andrade, p. 368. These figures were derived from Project CHECO's \\"Kontum: Battle for the Central Highlands\\", 27 October 1972, pp. 88‚Äì89. John Vann did not have time to savor his victory. While returning to Kon Tum from a briefing in Saigon on 9 June, he was killed in a helicopter crash.Plaudits were showered upon Vann after his death. He had risen to become \\"the indispensable man\\" and \\"the heart and soul of the defense of Kon Tum.\\" Andrade, p. 363. Even his enemy paid him a reverse tribute by exulting in his end, calling the death of \\"this outstanding chief advisor\\" \\"a stunning blow\\" against the U.S. and Saigon. Sheehan, p. 786. In late July the ARVN 22nd Division, now commanded by Brigadier General Phan Dinh Niem, in cooperation with B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province RF/PF forces, retook Ho√†i Nh∆°n and Tam Quan district towns and reestablished communications on Highway 1 north to the southern boundary of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 105. Southern Cambodia and IV Corps On 22 March the PAVN 101D Regiment, 1st Division attacked the ARVN 42nd Ranger Group outpost at Kompong Trach 15km north of the Cambodia-South Vietnam border. Fighting continued until the end of April as each side reinforced. The PAVN 1st Division eventually seized Kompong Trach but had suffered heavy losses which impacted its later operations in IV Corps.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 143-5. On 7 April PAVN/VC local main force units, the 18B, 95B, D1 and D2 Regiments began attacks in the Mekong Delta, initially in Ch∆∞∆°ng Thi·ªán Province. As the ARVN 21st Division and the 15th Regiment, 9th Division had been deployed to III Corps to reinforce the fighting at An L·ªôc, the PAVN/VC were initially able to have some success against isolated RF/PF outposts.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 145-6. On 18 May elements of the PAVN 52D and 101D Regiments, 1st Division attacked Ki√™n L∆∞∆°ng, the fighting continued for ten days before ARVN Rangers and armored forces succeeded in forcing the PAVN to withdraw towards the Cambodian border.Tr∆∞·ªüng, p. 148. On 23 May following fighting between the PAVN 207th Regiment and ARVN Ranger and armored forces in Cambodia, 15km north of Cai Cai, the ARVN captured documents indicating plans for PAVN infiltration into northern Ki·∫øn T∆∞·ªùng Province and subsequent attacks against M·ªôc H√≥a. Subsequent intelligence showed that the PAVN 5th Division which had been beaten at An L·ªôc was moving into the Elephant's Foot () area of Cambodia and would then move into Base Area 470 in the Plain of Reeds. The ARVN 7th Division deployed to the Elephant's Foot area to engage PAVN forces and with strong U.S. air support inflicted severe losses on the PAVN units there. However despite their losses two regiments from the PAVN 5th Division and the 24th and Z18 Regiments pushed towards Base Area 470 and by early July six PAVN regiments were located in northern ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 149-50. In late June after 22 days of fighting the ARVN 7th Division recaptured Kompong Trabek and cleared Route QL-1 (Cambodia) to Neak Loeung, however the PAVN recaptured the area when the 7th Division was withdrawn back into IV Corps in July to counter the PAVN/VC threat to Route QL-4, the vital supply line between the Delta's ricebowl and Saigon. With the return of the ARVN 21st Division and 15th Regiment, 9th Division to IV Corps and continuous pounding from the air by U.S. tactical air and B-52's, the ARVN was able to mount a series of operations in ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province and Base Area 470 that forced the PAVN/VC to reduce their operations and disperse into smaller units or withdraw into Cambodia.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 150-3. While not as dramatic as the fighting on the other fronts of the Easter Offensive, IV Corps had managed to prevent the PAVN/VC from cutting Route QL-4 or seriously disrupting pacification efforts in the Mekong Delta while sharing nearly half of its forces with III Corps and I Corps.Tr∆∞·ªüng, pp. 155. Air support, Freedom Train, and Linebacker The North Vietnamese had timed their offensive well by having it coincide with the end of the annual winter monsoon when low cloud cover and rain provided a blanket under which the offensive could proceed without interference by allied aerial attack. Air strikes were possible only by all-weather fighters or bombers, which could deliver their ordnance accurately through the cloud cover by radar direction or LORAN.Nalty, p. 358. Increased American air power: F-111s and F-4s at Takhli RTAFB (top) and A-7s and F-4s at Korat RTAFB in Thailand These missions were conducted by aircraft assigned to the U.S. Seventh Air Force and Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force in South Vietnam and Thailand or by the U.S. Navy's Task Force 77, offshore in the South China Sea. Besides the weather the most serious problem facing the Americans was that the drawdown of U.S. forces during the previous four years had included valuable ground support aircraft and their maintenance crews. By the spring of 1972, the U.S. Air Force had only three squadrons of F-4 Phantoms and one of A-37 Dragonflys available in the Republic of Vietnam, a total of 76 aircraft. Another 114 fighter-bombers were stationed at various bases in Thailand. 83 B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers were located at U-Tapao RTAFB and at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.Tilford, pp. 223‚Äì224. Task Force 77 had four carriers assigned to it, but only two, and were on station at the onset of the offensive. Their air wings totaled 140 strike aircraft.Morrocco (1984), p. 170. To rectify the aircraft shortage, from 7 April to 13 May 176 F-4s and 12 F-105 Thunderchiefs were transferred from air bases in the Republic of Korea and the continental U.S. to Thailand during Operation Constant Guard I-IV.Lavalle, pp. 19, 23‚Äì26. Between 5 February and 23 May, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) reinforced Guam during Operation Bullet Shot with a further 124 bombers, bringing the total available in- theater to 209.Tilford, p. 224. See also Lavalle, p. 27. The Seventh Fleet was also beefed up by the addition of five aircraft carrier groups, including those of the , , , , and . This made five carriers available at any one time to conduct aerial operations.Lavalle, p. 17. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) at this time consisted of nine squadrons of A-1 Skyraiders, A-37s, and F-5 Freedom Fighters, a total of 119 strike aircraft. There were also two squadrons of AC-47 or AC-119 fixed-wing gunships, totaling of 28 aircraft.Nalty, p. 333. SA-2 Guideline anti-aircraft missile on camouflaged launcher The weather conditions made early ground support haphazard, and these difficulties were compounded by North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which advanced behind the front line elements. PAVN moved 85 and 100 mm radar- directed batteries south of the DMZ and, on 17 February 81 SA-2 Guideline missiles were launched from the DMZ area, downing three F-4s.Lavalle, p. 34. This heralded the farthest southern advance of SA-2 units thus far during the conflict. This classic high-low anti-aircraft coverage made aerial attacks extremely hazardous, especially when it was enhanced by the new shoulder-fired Grail. The loss of the northern firebases early in the offensive in I Corps made U.S. naval gunfire the primary source of artillery support in that area. U.S. Marine Corps gunfire observers were then assigned to fly with forward air controllers, providing coordinates for shore targets.Lavalle, p. 46. At the height of the offensive three U.S. cruisers and 38 destroyers were providing naval gunfire support.Sorley, p. 326. ZSU-57-2 tracked anti-aircraft vehicle With clearing weather the number of aircraft sorties soared. Between April and June there were 18,000 combat sorties flown to support the ARVN defense, 45 percent by the U.S. Air Force, 30 percent by the Navy and Marine Corps, and 25 percent by the VNAF. B-52s flew an additional 2,724 sorties. Ten U.S. and six VNAF aircraft were lost to SAM or anti-aircraft fire.Nalty, p. 369‚Äì370. On 4 April, reacting to the fierceness of the offensive, President Nixon authorized tactical airstrikes from the DMZ north to the 18th parallel, the southern panhandle of North Vietnam. This supply interdiction effort was the first systematic bombing carried out in North Vietnam proper since the end of Operation Rolling Thunder in November 1968. Airstrikes north of the 20th parallel were authorized on 5 April under the cover name Operation Freedom Train.Tilford, p. 228. The first B-52 strike of the new operation was conducted on 10 April. President Nixon then decided to up the ante by targeting Hanoi and Haiphong. Between 1 May and 30 June, B-52s, fighter- bombers, and fixed-wing gunships had carried out 18,000 sorties over North Vietnam and suffered 29 aircraft losses.Michael Casey, Clark Dougan, Samuel Lispman, et al., Flags into Battle. Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1987, p. 39. SA-7 Grail shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile and launcher On 8 May Nixon authorized the launching of Operation Pocket Money, the aerial mining of Haiphong and other North Vietnamese ports. Nixon had taken a gamble that Soviet Union, with which he was conducting negotiations for a strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT I), would withhold a negative reaction in return for improved relations with the West. He was correct. The People's Republic of China also muted any overt response to the escalatory measures for the same reason. Emboldened, Nixon decided to launch Operation Linebacker a systematic aerial assault on North Vietnam's transportation, storage, and air defense systems on 10 May. During Linebacker, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps lost 104 aircraft in combat while their North Vietnamese opponents lost 63., on-line book, pp. 95‚Äì102. Aftermath At the conclusion of the ARVN counteroffensive, both sides were exhausted but considered their efforts to have been successful. The South Vietnamese and the Americans believed the policy of Vietnamization to have been validated,Palmer, p. 324. the internal weaknesses of the South Vietnamese command structure, which had been rectified somewhat during the emergency, reappeared once it had passed. During the operations, more than 25,000 South Vietnamese civilians had been killed and almost a million became refugees, 600,000 of whom were living in camps under government care.Andrade, p. 529. American casualties in combat for all of 1972 totaled only 300 killed, most during the offensive.Andrade, p. 531. Hanoi had committed 14 divisions and 26 independent regiments to the offensive and had suffered approximately 100,000 casualties and lost almost all of its armored forces committed (134 T-54s, 56 PT-76s and 60 T-34s).Andrade, p. 536. In return, it had gained permanent control of half of the four northernmost provinces (Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Th·ª´a Thi√™n, Qu·∫£ng Nam, and Qu·∫£ng T√≠n) as well as the western fringes of the II and III Corps sectors, around 10% of the country. It is believed that the North Vietnamese leadership had both underestimated the fighting ability of the ARVN, which, by 1972, had become one of the best- equipped armies in the world, and failed to grasp the destructiveness of American air power against an enemy fighting a conventional battle. Combined with these strategic errors, PAVN commanders had also thrown away their local numerical superiority by making frontal attacks into heavy defensive fire and suffered massive casualties as a consequence. However, by its own estimate, the PAVN had also dealt the most severe blow in the entire war, with over 200,000 ARVN casualties, a third of the South's entire armed forces. That also allowed Viet Cong irregulars and political agents to make a return through the gaps in the defensive lines, which had been torn open during the offensive. Hanoi wasted no time in making use of what it had gained. The North Vietnamese immediately began to extend their supply corridors from Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam. The PAVN rapidly expanded port facilities at the captured town of ƒê√¥ng H√†, and within a year, over 20 percent of the materiel destined for the southern battlefield was flowing across its docks.Fulghum and Maitland, p. 183. In all of 1972, the PAVN suffered over 100,000 dead, according to The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam. The ARVN suffered 39,587 dead in the same period, while American military deaths that year were 759, per U.S. military records.Clarke, Jeffrey J. (1988), United States Army in Vietnam: Advice and Support: The Final Years, 1965‚Äì1973, Washington, D.C: Center of Military History, United States Army, p. 275 For the PAVN, the offensive was very costly. General Tran Van Tra, writing about the offensive ten years after the fact, stated, \\"Our troops were exhausted and their units in disarray. We had not been able to make up losses. We were short of manpower as well as food and ammunition.\\"Stanley Karnow. \\"Vietnam: A History.\\" Penguin Books, June 1997. Page 659. In Paris, the peace negotiations continued, but this time, both sides were willing to make concessions. The chief American negotiator, Henry Kissinger, offered a ceasefire, recognition of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam by the Saigon government, and the total American withdrawal from South Vietnam as incentives. The terms were enough to meet the criteria for victory that Hanoi's leaders had established before the offensive. The only obstacle to a settlement was Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, whose government would have to assent to any agreement. The intransigence of Thi·ªáu and his demand for the U.S. not to abandon his nation after any agreement, as well as new demands by Hanoi, caused the stalling of peace talks in December. That led Nixon to launch Operation Linebacker II, a bombing campaign aimed at North Vietnam's transport network, especially around Hanoi and Haiphong. The Paris Peace Accords, signed in January 1973, confirmed that North Vietnamese troops would remain in South Vietnam in the areas that they occupied.

Statistics are recorded for each player during a match, and aggregated over a career. At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include their Test match statistics ‚Äì but not vice versa. Nowadays records are also maintained for List A and Twenty20 limited over matches. These matches are normally limited over games played domestically at the national level by leading Test nations. Since one-day internationals are a form of List A limited over matches, a player's List A statistics will include their ODI match statistics ‚Äì but not vice versa. General statistics * Matches (Mat/M): Number of matches played. (also Played (Pl).) * Catches (Ct): Number of catches taken. * Stumpings (St): Number of stumpings made (as a wicket- keeper). Batting statistics * Innings (I): The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted. * Not outs (NO): The number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in.1 * Runs (R): The number of runs scored. * 4's: The number of 4's the batsmen has scored. * 6's: The number of 6's the batsmen has scored. * Highest score (HS/Best): The highest score ever made by the batsman. * Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out. Ave = Runs/[I ‚Äì NO] (also Avge or Avg.) * Centuries (100): The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more. * Half-centuries (50): The number of innings in which the batsman scored fifty to ninety-nine runs (centuries do not count as half-centuries as well). * Balls faced (BF or B): The total number of balls received, including no-balls but not including wides. * Strike rate (SR): The average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. (SR = [100 * Runs]/BF) * Run rate (RR): The average number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of 6 balls. * Net run rate (NRR): A method of ranking teams with equal points in limited overs league competitions. * Runs Per Wicket Ratio (RpW ratio): The number of runs scored per wicket lost, divided by the number of runs conceded per wicket taken. It is a method of ranking teams with equal points in the league table of the World Test Championship. 1 Batsmen who are not required to bat in a particular innings (due to victory or declaration) are not considered \\"Not Out\\" in that innings. Only the player/s who have taken to the crease and remained there until the completion of an innings, are marked \\"Not Out\\" on the scorecard. For statistical purposes, batsmen who retire due to injury or illness are also deemed not out, while batsmen who retire for any other reason are deemed out, except in exceptional circumstances (in 1983 Gordon Greenidge, not out on 154, departed a Test match to be with his daughter, who was ill and subsequently died ‚Äì he was subsequently deemed not out the only such decision in the history of Test cricket). Bowling statistics * Overs (O or OV): The number of overs bowled. The notation is (x.y), meaning x completed overs plus y legal balls in the current over have been bowled. * Balls (B): The number of balls bowled. Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically (and even within a single match, can vary due to umpire miscounting). * Maiden overs (M): The number of maiden overs (overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs) bowled. * Runs (R): The number of runs conceded. * Wickets (W): The number of wickets taken. * Bowling analysis (BA or OMRW): A shorthand notation consisting of a bowler's Overs, Maidens, Runs conceded and Wickets taken (in that order), usually for a single innings but sometimes for other periods. For example, an analysis of 10‚Äì3‚Äì27‚Äì2 would indicate that the player bowled ten overs, of which three were maidens, conceded 27 runs and took two wickets. * No-balls (Nb): The number of no-balls bowled. * Wides (Wd): The number of wides bowled. * Bowling average (Ave): The average number of runs conceded per wicket. (Ave = Runs/W) * Strike rate (SR): The average number of balls bowled per wicket taken. (SR = Balls/W) * Economy rate (Econ): The average number of runs conceded per over. (Econ = Runs/Overs bowled). * Best bowling (BB): The bowler's best bowling performance, defined as firstly the greatest number of wickets, secondly the fewest runs conceded for that number of wickets. (Thus, a performance of 7 for 102 is considered better than one of 6 for 19.) ** BBI stands for Best Bowling in Innings and only gives the score for one innings. (If only the BB rate is given it's considered the BBI rate.) ** BBM stands for Best Bowling in Match and gives the combined score over 2 or more innings in one match. (For limited-overs matches with one innings per side, this score is equal to the BBI or BB.) * Five wickets in an innings (5w): The number of innings in which the bowler took at least five wickets. Four wickets in an innings (4w), the number of innings in which the bowler took exactly four wickets, is sometimes recorded alongside five wickets, especially in limited overs cricket. * Ten wickets in a match (10w): The number of matches in which the bowler took at least ten wickets; recorded for Tests and first-class matches only. Representation: Bowler ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì https://www.allacronyms.com/cricket/abbreviations Extras Dynamic and graphical statistics The advent of saturation television coverage of professional cricket has provided an impetus to develop new and interesting forms of presenting statistical data to viewers. Television networks have thus invented several new ways of presenting statistics. The advent of T20 cricket has contributed to this as well. These include displaying two-dimensional and even three-dimensional plots of shot directions and distances on an overhead view of a cricket field, commonly referred to as a Wagon-Wheel. Other forms include graphs of run scoring and wicket taking numbers plotted against time or balls bowled over a career or within a match. These graphics can be changed dynamically through a computer-controlled back-end, as statistics evolve during a game. Commonly used graphics, especially during a limited-over match, are a worm graph, called so, for the worm-like appearance of the teams' score progression as the overs progress; and; a Manhattan Chart, called so, for its resemblance to the Manhattan skyline. Notation The asterisk (the * symbol) is used to mean different things in different contexts: * In the context of the two batsmen currently out in the field, it is used to indicate which of them is the striker. * For a batsman who appears in a scorecard (i.e. in an assessment of the batting performance of all batsmen on his team), it is used to indicate that the batsman finished not out in the innings. * In a team lineup, the captain has an asterisk placed after his name.https://cricket.or.jp/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/scoring_guide.pdf Parentheses (or numbers presented in smaller font next to other numbers) generally indicate number of balls: * For a bowler, the number of overs they have bowled is sometimes placed in parentheses next to their number of wickets taken and runs conceded i.e. 3-45 (5.2) indicates 5.2 overs have been bowled. * For a batsman, they indicate the number of balls faced i.e. 20 (33) means 20 runs scored from 33 deliveries. A slash or dash between two numbers usually indicates that one of the numbers is the number of runs, and the other number is the number of wickets: * 3/21 for a bowler means 3 wickets taken but 21 runs conceded. (See bowling analysis.) * 100-3 for a team means 100 runs scored for 3 wickets lost. (Australia reverses this order.) Innings are sometimes shortened to \\"inns\\" or \\"inn\\" i.e. 2nd inns of a Test match.

Derivatives Various substances were made from hartshorn shavings: * Oil of hartshorn is a crude animal oil obtained from the destructive distillation of male red deer bones or horns. * Salt of hartshorn refers to ammonium carbonate, an early form of smelling salts obtained by dry distillation of oil of hartshorn. * Spirit of hartshorn (or spirits of hartshorn) is an aqueous solution of ammonia. Originally, this term was applied to a solution manufactured from the hooves and horns of the red deer, as well as those of some other animals. The aqueous solution was colorless and pungent, consisting of about 28.5 percent ammonia. It was used chiefly as a detergent, for removing stains and extracting certain vegetable coloring agents, and in the manufacture of ammonium salts. Later, the term was applied to the partially purified similar products of the action of heat on nitrogenous animal matter generally. Finally, the term was applied to any aqueous solution of ammonia.  Uses   Medicine  Hartshorn jelly or a decoction of burnt hartshorn in water was used to treat diarrhea. The coal of hartshorn, called calcinated hartshorn, was used as an absorbent, as well as in the treatment of dysentery. Salt of hartshorn (ammonium carbonate) was used as a sudorific for treatment of fevers, and as a smelling salt. Hartshorn was used to treat insect bites, sunstroke, stye, and snakebites. Baking Hartshorn salt (ammonium carbonate), also known simply as hartshorn, and baker's ammonia, was used as a leavening agent, in the baking of cookies and other edible treats. It was used mainly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a forerunner of baking powder. A half- teaspoon of hartshorn can substitute for one teaspoon of baking powder. It is called for in old German and Scandinavian recipes and, although rarely used in modern times, may still be purchased as a baking ingredient. Hartshorn helps molded cookies such as Springerle to retain their intricate designs during baking. Cookies made with hartshorn can be kept for a long time without hardening. Use of hartshorn may turn some ingredients, such as sunflower seeds, green. Ammonium carbonate is especially suited to thin, dry cookies and crackers. When heated, it releases ammonia and carbon dioxide gases, but no water. The absence of water allows cookies to cook and dry out more quickly, and thinner cookies allow the pungent ammonia to escape, rather than to remain trapped, as it would in a deeper mass. =Safety concerns= Ammonia released during the baking process reacts with glucose and fructose to form intermediate molecules that in turn, react with asparagine (an amino acid found in nuts, seeds, and whole grains) to form acrylamide, a carcinogen.

There is evidence of human occupation since prehistoric times with hand axes and flint points from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras, and a range of burial mounds, hill forts and other artefacts dating from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. The oldest dated human road work in Great Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden planks in the 39th century BCE. Following the Roman Empire's invasion of southern Britain, the mining of lead and silver in the Mendip Hills provided a basis for local industry and commerce. Bath became the site of a major Roman fort and city, the remains of which can still be seen. During the Early Medieval period Somerset was the scene of battles between the Anglo-Saxons and first the Britons and later the Danes. In this period it was ruled first by various kings of Wessex, and later by kings of England. Following the defeat of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy by the Normans in 1066, castles were built in Somerset. Expansion of the population and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times the population has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super- Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was. Palaeolithic and Mesolithic The Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods saw hunter-gatherers move into the region of Somerset. There is evidence from flint artefacts in a quarry at Westbury that an ancestor of modern man, possibly Homo heidelbergensis, was present in the area from around 500,000 years ago. There is still some doubt about whether the artefacts are of human origin but they have been dated within Oxygen Isotope Stage 13 (524,000 ‚Äì 478,000 BP). Other experts suggest that \\"many of the bone-rich Middle Pleistocene deposits belong to a single but climatically variable interglacial that succeeded the Cromerian, perhaps about 500,000 years ago. Detailed analysis of the origin and modification of the flint artefacts leads to the conclusion that the assemblage was probably a product of geomorphological processes rather than human work, but a single cut-marked bone suggests a human presence.\\" Animal bones and artefacts unearthed in the 1980s at Westbury-sub-Mendip, in Somerset, have shown evidence of early human activity approximately 700,000 years ago. Homo sapiens sapiens, or modern man, came to Somerset during the Early Upper Palaeolithic. There is evidence of occupation of four Mendip caves 35,000 to 30,000 years ago.The Archaeology of Somerset by C Webster and T Mayberry During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, it is probable that Somerset was deserted as the area experienced tundra conditions. Evidence was found in Gough's Cave of deposits of human bone dating from around 12,500 years ago. The bones were defleshed and probably ritually buried though perhaps related to cannibalism being practised in the area at the time or making skull cups or storage containers. Somerset was one of the first areas of future England settled following the end of Younger Dryas phase of the last Ice Age c. 8000 BC. Cheddar Man is the name given to the remains of a human male found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge. He is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton. The remains date from about 7150 BC, and it appears that he died a violent death. Somerset is thought to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from about 6000 BCE; Mesolithic artefacts have been found in more than 70 locations. Mendip caves were used as burial places, with between 50 and 100 skeletons being found in Aveline's Hole. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BCE, there is evidence of farming. At the end of the last Ice Age the Bristol Channel was dry land, but later the sea level rose, particularly between 1220 and 900 BC and between 800 and 470 BCE, resulting in major coastal changes. The Somerset Levels became flooded, but the dry points such as Glastonbury and Brent Knoll have a long history of settlement, and are known to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunters. The county has prehistoric burial mounds (such as Stoney Littleton Long Barrow), stone rows (such as the circles at Stanton Drew and Priddy) and settlement sites. Evidence of Mesolithic occupation has come both from the upland areas, such as in Mendip caves, and from the low land areas such as the Somerset Levels. Dry points in the latter such as Glastonbury Tor and Brent Knoll, have a long history of settlement with wooden trackways between them. There were also \\"lake villages\\" in the marsh such as those at Glastonbury Lake Village and Meare. One of the oldest dated human road work in Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden planks in the 39th century BC, partially on the route of the even earlier Post Track. Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages Stanton Drew stone circles There is evidence of Exmoor's human occupation from Mesolithic times onwards. In the Neolithic period people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the Bronze and Iron Ages. The caves of the Mendip Hills were settled during the Neolithic period and contain extensive archaeological sites such as those at Cheddar Gorge. There are numerous Iron Age Hill Forts, which were later reused in the Dark Ages, such as Cadbury Castle, Worlebury Camp and Ham Hill. The age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown, but is believed to be from the Neolithic period. There is evidence of mining on the Mendip Hills back into the late Bronze Age when there were technological changes in metal working indicated by the use of lead. There are numerous \\"hill forts\\", such as Small Down Knoll, Solsbury Hill, Dolebury Warren and Burledge Hill, which seem to have had domestic purposes, not just a defensive role. They generally seem to have been occupied intermittently from the Bronze Age onward, some, such as Cadbury Camp at South Cadbury, being refurbished during different eras. Battlegore Burial Chamber is a Bronze Age burial chamber at Williton which is composed of three round barrows and possibly a long, chambered barrow. The Iron Age tribes of later Somerset were the Dobunni in north Somerset, Durotriges in south Somerset and Dumnonii in west Somerset. The first and second produced coins, the finds of which allows their tribal areas to be suggested, but the latter did not. All three had a Celtic culture and language. However, Ptolemy stated that Bath was in the territory of the Belgae, but this may be a mistake. The Celtic gods were worshipped at the temple of Sulis at Bath and possibly the temple on Brean Down. Iron Age sites on the Quantock Hills, include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as smaller earthwork enclosures, such as Trendle Ring, Elworthy Barrows and Plainsfield Camp. Roman Roman public baths in Bath Cadbury Castle Somerset was part of the Roman Empire from 47 AD to about 409 AD. However, the end was not abrupt and elements of Romanitas lingered on for perhaps a century. Somerset was invaded from the south-east by the Second Legion Augusta, under the future emperor Vespasian. The hillforts of the Durotriges at Ham Hill and Cadbury Castle were captured. Ham Hill probably had a temporary Roman occupation. The massacre at Cadbury Castle seems to have been associated with the later Boudiccan Revolt of 60‚Äì61 AD. The county remained part of the Roman Empire until around 409 AD. The Roman invasion, and possibly the preceding period of involvement in the internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired in part by the potential of the Mendip Hills. A great deal of the attraction of the lead mines may have been the potential for the extraction of silver. Forts were set up at Bath and Ilchester. The lead and silver mines at Charterhouse in the Mendip Hills were run by the military. The Romans established a defensive boundary along the new military road known the Fosse Way (from the Latin fossa meaning ditch). The Fosse Way ran through Bath, Shepton Mallet, Ilchester and south-west towards Axminster. The road from Dorchester ran through Yeovil to meet the Fosse Way at Ilchester. Small towns and trading ports were set up, such as Camerton and Combwich. The larger towns decayed in the latter part of the period, though the smaller ones appear to have decayed less. In the latter part of the period, Ilchester seems to have been a \\"civitas\\" capital and Bath may also have been one. Particularly to the east of the River Parrett, villas were constructed. However, only a few Roman sites have been found to the west of the river. The villas have produced important mosaics and artifacts. Cemeteries have been found outside the Roman towns of Somerset and by Roman temples such as that at Lamyatt. Romano-British farming settlements, such as those at Catsgore and Sigwells, have been found in Somerset. There was salt production on the Somerset Levels near Highbridge and quarrying took place near Bath, where the Roman Baths gave their name to Bath. Excavations carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337 ‚Äì 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome. In April 2010, the Frome Hoard, one of the largest-ever hoards of Roman coins discovered in Britain, was found by a metal detectorist. The hoard of 52,500 coins dated from the 3rd century AD and was found buried in a field near Frome, in a jar below the surface. The coins were excavated by archaeologists from the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Sub-Roman period This is the period from about 409 AD to the start of Saxon political control, which was mainly in the late 7th century, though they are said to have captured the Bath area in 577 AD. Initially the Britons of Somerset seem to have continued much as under the Romans but without the imperial taxation and markets. There was then a period of civil war in Britain though it is not known how this affected Somerset. The Western Wandsdyke may have been constructed in this period but archaeological data shows that it was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. This area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 501‚Äì97 AD . The ditch is on the north side, so presumably it was used by the Celts as a defence against Saxons encroaching from the upper Thames Valley. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the British Celtic tribes, with victories at Bradford-on-Avon (in the Avon Gap in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD,The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 645‚Äì56 AD and further south at the Battle of Peonnum (at Penselwood) in 658 AD,The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 658‚Äì75 AD followed by an advance west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett.The Victoria History of the County of Somerset, Vol 1 (1906) The Saxon advance from the east seems to have been halted by battles between the British and Saxons, for example; at the siege of Badon Mons Badonicus (which may have been in the Bath region e.g. at Solsbury Hill), or Bathampton Down. During the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, Somerset was probably partly in the Kingdom of Dumnonia, partly in the land of the Durotriges and partly in that of the Dobunni. The boundaries between these is largely unknown, but may have been similar to those in the Iron Age. Various \\"tyrants\\" seem to have controlled territories from reoccupied hill forts. There is evidence of an elite at hill forts such as Cadbury Castle and Cadbury Camp; for example, there is imported pottery. Cemeteries are an important source of evidence for the period and large ones have been found in Somerset, such as that at Cannington, which was used from the Roman to the Saxon period. The towns of Somerset seem to have been little used during that period but there continued to be farming on the villa sites and at the Romano-British villages. There may have been effects from plague and volcanic eruption during this period as well as marine transgression into the Levels. The language spoken during this period is thought to be Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673 AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street. Most of what is known of the history of this period comes from Gildas's On the Ruin of Britain, which is thought to have been written in Durotrigan territory, possibly at Glastonbury. The earliest fortification of Taunton started for King Ine of Wessex and √Üthelburg, in or about the year 710 AD. However, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle this was destroyed 12 years later. Early Medieval Wells Cathedral ‚Äì the first church on this site was built in 705 AD This is the period from the late 7th century (for most of Somerset) to 1066, though for part of the 10th and 11th centuries England was under Danish control. Somerset, like Dorset to the south, held the West Saxon advance from Wiltshire/Hampshire back for over a century, remaining a frontier between the Saxons and the Romano-British Celts. The Saxons conquered Bath following the Battle of Deorham in 577, and the border was probably established along the line of the Wansdyke to the north of the Mendip Hills. Then Cenwalh of Wessex broke through at Bradford-on-Avon in 652, and the Battle of Peonnum possibly at Penselwood in 658, advancing west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. In 661 the Saxons may have advanced into what is now Devon as a result of a battle fought at Postesburh, possibly Posbury near Crediton. Then in the period 681‚Äì85 Centwine of Wessex conquered King Cadwaladr and \\"advanced as far as the sea\\", but it is not clear where this was. It is assumed that the Saxons occupied the rest of Somerset about this time. The Saxon rule was consolidated under King Ine, who established a fort at Taunton, demolished by his wife in 722. It is sometimes said that he built palaces at Somerton and South Petherton but this does not seem to be the case. He fought against Geraint in 710. In 705 the diocese of Sherborne was formed, taking in Wessex west of Selwood. Saxon kings granted land in Somerset by charter from the 7th century onward. The way and extent to which the Britons survived under the Saxons is a debatable matter. However, King Ine's laws make provision for Britons. Somerset originally formed part of Wessex and latter became a separate \\"shire\\". Somersetshire seems to have been formed within Wessex during the 8th century though it is not recorded as a name until later. Mints were set up at times in various places in Somerset in the Saxon period, e.g., Watchet. Somerset played an important part in defeating the spread of the Danes in the 9th century. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 845 Alderman Eanwulf, with the men of Somersetshire (Sumors«£te), and Bishop Ealstan, and Alderman Osric, with the men of Dorsetshire, conquered the Danish army at the mouth of the Parret. This was the first known use of the name Somers√¶te. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that in January 878 the King Alfred the Great fled into the marshes of Somerset from the Viking's invasion and made a fort at Athelney. From the fort Alfred was able to organize an resistance using the local militias from Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire. Viking raids took place for instance in 987 and 997 at Watchet and the Battle of Cynwit. King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, usually considered to be near Edington, Wiltshire, but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or Herepath, so his army could cover Viking movements at sea. The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation 20 m wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. The Herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks along the line of the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to Triscombe Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred's base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor.Greswell, W. H. P. (1922) Dumnonia and the Valley of the Parret A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller. Burhs (fortified places) had been set up by 919, such as Lyng. The Alfred Jewel, an object about 2.5 inch long, made of filigree gold, cloisonn√©-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. Believed to have been owned by Alfred the Great it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fit into the hole at its base and been used while reading a book. Monasteries and minster churches were set up all over Somerset, with daughter churches from the minsters in manors. There was a royal palace at Cheddar, which was used at times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot, and there is likely to have been a \\"central place\\" at Somerton, Bath, Glastonbury and Frome since the kings visited them. The towns of Somerset seem to have been in occupation in this period though evidence for this is limited because of subsequent buildings on top of remains from this period. Agriculture flourished in this period, with a re-organisation into centralised villages in the latter part in the east of the county. In the period before the Norman Conquest, Somerset came under the control of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family. There seems to have been some Danish settlement at Thurloxton and Spaxton, judging from the place-names. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence. This period of Somerset's history is well documented, for example in the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle and Asser's Life of Alfred. Later Medieval Dunster yarn market and castle This is the period from 1066 to around 1500. Following the defeat of the Saxons by the Normans in 1066, various castles were set up in Somerset by the new lords such as that at Dunster, and the manors was awarded to followers of William the Conqueror such as William de Moyon and Walter of Douai. Somerset does not seem to have played much part in the civil war in King Stephen's time, but Somerset lords were main players in the murder of Thomas Becket. A good picture of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some difficulty in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families this may have been around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available. Reclamation of land from marsh in the Somerset Levels increased, largely under monastic influence. Crafts and industries also flourished, the Somerset woollen industry being one of the largest in England at this time. \\"New towns\\" were founded in this period in Somerset, i.e. Newport, but were not successful. Coal mining on the Mendips was an important source of wealth while quarrying also took place, an example is near Bath. The towns grew, again often by monastic instigation, during this period and fairs were started. The church was very powerful at this period, particularly Glastonbury Abbey. After their church burnt down, the monks there \\"discovered\\" the tomb of \\"King Arthur\\" and were able rebuild their church. There were over 20 monasteries in Somerset at this period including the priory at Hinton Charterhouse which was founded in 1232 by Ela, Countess of Salisbury who also founded Lacock Abbey. Many parish churches were re-built in this period. Between 1107 and 1129 William Giffard the Chancellor of King Henry I, converted the bishop's hall in Taunton into Taunton Castle. Bridgwater Castle was built in 1202 by William Brewer. It passed to the king in 1233 and in 1245 repairs were ordered to its motte and towers. During the 11th century Second Barons' War against Henry III, Bridgwater was held by the barons against the King. In the English Civil War the town and the castle were held by the Royalists under Colonel Sir Francis Wyndham. Eventually, with many buildings destroyed in the town, the castle and its valuable contents were surrendered to the Parliamentarians. The castle itself was deliberately destroyed in 1645. During the Middle Ages sheep farming for the wool trade came to dominate the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818. In the medieval period the River Parrett was used to transport Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill, Bridgwater was part of the Port of Bristol until the Port of Bridgwater was created in 1348, covering of the Somerset coast line, from the Devon border to the mouth of the River Axe.Lawrence, J.F. (revised and completed by Lawrence, J.C.) (2005). A History of Bridgwater. Chichester: Phillimore. . Chapter 8: \\"The Medieval Port of Bridgwater\\". Historically, the main port on the river was at Bridgwater; the river being bridged at this point, with the first bridge being constructed in 1200 AD. Quays were built in 1424; with another quay, the Langport slip, being built in 1488 upstream of the Town Bridge. A Customs House was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay; and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. The river was navigable, with care, to Bridgwater Town Bridge by vessels. By trans-shipping into barges at the Town Bridge the Parrett was navigable as far as Langport and (via the River Yeo) to Ilchester. Early Modern Montacute House This is the period from around 1500 to 1800. In the 1530s, the monasteries were dissolved and their lands bought from the king by various important families in Somerset. By 1539, Glastonbury Abbey was the only monastery left, its abbot Richard Whiting was then arrested and executed on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. From the Tudor to the Georgian times, farming specialised and techniques improved, leading to increases in population, although no new towns seem to have been founded. Large country houses such as at Hinton St George and Montacute House were built at this time. The Bristol Channel floods of 1607 are believed to have affected large parts of the Somerset Levels with flooding up to above sea level. In 1625, a House of Correction was established in Shepton Mallet and, today, HMP Shepton Mallet is England's oldest prison still in use. Also in updated form as a CD- ROM (2001), see \\"Shepton Mallet Prison: 390 years of prison regime\\" During the English Civil War, Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, although Dunster was a Royalist stronghold. The county was the site of important battles between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians, notably the Battle of Lansdowne in 1643 and the Battle of Langport in 1645. The castle changed hands several times during 1642‚Äì45 along with the town. During the Siege of Taunton it was defended by Robert Blake, from July 1644 to July 1645. This war resulted in castles being destroyed to prevent their re-use. In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion in which Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw the losers being sentenced to death or transportation. The Society of Friends established itself in Street in the mid-17th century, and among the close-knit group of Quaker families were the Clarks: Cyrus started a business in sheepskin rugs, later joined by his brother James, who introduced the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes. C&J; Clark still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. The 18th century was largely one of peace and declining industrial prosperity in Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society being founded in 1777 to improve methods. John Billingsley conducted a survey of the county's agriculture in 1795 but found that methods could still be improved. Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington. He is commemorated on a nearby hill with a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument. In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset coalfield was an important industry, and in an effort to reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but very little of it was ever constructed. Late Modern West Somerset Railway The 19th century saw improvements to Somerset's roads with the introduction of turnpikes and the building of canals and railways. The usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though they have now been restored for recreation. The railways were nationalised after the Second World War, but continued until 1965, when smaller lines were scrapped; two were transferred back to private ownership as \\"heritage\\" lines. In 1889, Somerset County Council was created, replacing the administrative functions of the Quarter Sessions. The population of Somerset has continued to grow since 1800, when it was 274,000, particularly in the seaside towns such as Weston-super-Mare. Some population decline occurred earlier in the period in the villages, but this has now been reversed, and by 1951 the population of Somerset was 551,000. Chard claims to be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, as well as by the provision of an electricity supply. Around the 1860s, at the height of the iron and steel era, a pier and a deep- water dock were built, at Portishead, by the Bristol & Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. The Portishead power stations were coal-fed power stations built next to the dock. Construction work started on Portishead \\"A\\" power station in 1926. It began generating electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation's Electricity Department. In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a chemical works on the opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. The onset of new generating capacity at Pembroke (oil-fired) and Didcot (coal-fired) in the mid-1970s brought about the closure of the older, less efficient \\"A\\" Station. The newer of the two power stations (\\"B\\" Station) was converted to burn oil when the Somerset coalfields closed. Industrial activities ceased in the dock with the closure of the power stations. The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992, and it has now been developed into a marina and residential area. During the First World War hundreds of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were put up in most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties ‚Äì though much fewer ‚Äì during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive.Cocroft, Wayne D. (2000). Dangerous Energy: The archaeology of gunpowder and military explosives manufacture. Swindon: English Heritage. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time.Williams, Michael. (1970). The Draining of the Somerset Levels. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down. Exmoor was one of the first British National Parks, designated in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. and is named after its main river. It was expanded in 1991 and in 1993 Exmoor was designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Mendip Hills followed with AONB designation in 1972. Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was a Magnox power station constructed between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) which was designed to generate 1250 MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricit√© de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) reactor known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016. Somerset today has only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and only small towns in comparison with other areas of England. Tourism is a major source of employment along the coast, and in Bath and Cheddar for example. Other attractions include Exmoor, West Somerset Railway, Haynes Motor Museum and the Fleet Air Arm Museum as well as the churches and the various National Trust and English Heritage properties in Somerset. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries take place in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the number of apple orchards has reduced. In the late 19th century the boundaries of Somerset were slightly altered, but the main change came in 1974 when the county of Avon was set up. The northern part of Somerset was removed from the administrative control of Somerset County Council. On abolition of the county of Avon in 1996, these areas became separate administrative authorities, \\"North Somerset\\" and \\"Bath and North East Somerset\\". The Department for Communities and Local Government was considering a proposal by Somerset County Council to change Somerset's administrative structure by abolishing the five districts to create a Somerset unitary authority. The changes were planned to be implemented no later than 1 April 2009. However, support for the county council's bid was not guaranteed and opposition among the district council and local population was strong; 82% of people responding to a referendum organised by the five district councils rejected the proposals. It was confirmed in July 2007 that the government had rejected the proposals for unitary authorities in Somerset, and that the present two-tier arrangements of Somerset County Council and the district councils will remain.

They were fronted by mainstay member, Irena Luckus on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar before disbanding in 1983.  History  Zero were formed in Brisbane in 1977 with the initial line-up of Peter Adams on guitar and vocals; Chris Anderson on guitar and vocals; Jude Clarkin on bongos; Barbara Hart on saxophone and flute; John Hunt on bass guitar; Irena Luckus on vocals, keyboard and guitar; and Debbie Penny on drums. By 1978, now including Vic Allen, Deborah Thomas and Lindy Morrison, the band travelled across New South Wales by train, playing gigs in Canberra (in a large, very cold hall) and Newcastle (in a local pub). In 1979 the group settled as a four-piece with Luckus, Morrison, John Willsteed and Michael O'Connell, and among a number of significant gigs, opened for The Cure in support of that group's second album, Seventeen Seconds. The Go-Betweens Robert Forster was an occasional guest, and when Morrison left in September 1980 to join Forster and Grant McLennan, O'Connell also left, moving to Sydney to play in a number of bands. Zero then became Xiro, and decided on the Roland DR-55 as a suitable drummer replacement. Xiro issued two different four-track extended plays, Half the Profits and Religious Wars, on audio cassette in mid-1980. They supported The Cure again in 1981, with guest and future Xero drummer Steven Pritchard. Luckus and Willsteed were then joined by Clare McKenna on drums to become Xero and entered a period of intense song-writing in their Fortitude Valley practice rooms, and performing at various Brisbane venues. In 1982 Xero recorded a six-track extended play, Lust in the Dust, at Basement Studios, Brisbane with the line-up of Luckus, Tony Childs on bass guitar; John Willsteed on bass guitar, guitar, casio keyboards and vocals; and Steven Pritchard on drums. Xero split in 1983 when Luckus left Brisbane to relocate to France. Later, Morrison and Willsteed were members of fellow Brisbane group, the Go-Betweens.McFarlane, 'The Go-Betweens' entry.

In a meeting of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on 12 December 2002 it was shortlisted for inclusion in the Tentative List for further nomination to UNESCO for inscription in the World Heritage Site. The part of the town which is the centre of economic activities and where the administrative offices are located is called as Hapoli or locally known by the Apatanis as \\"Hao-Polyang\\". Ziro is around 115 km from the state capital Itanagar and takes approx 3 and a half hours via the improved Hoj-Potin road along NH229 and 150 km via the Assam route. Earlier the nearest railway station from Ziro was located at Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh near the Arunachal-Assam border which is around 100 km from Ziro. The nearest airport to the settlement is Lilabari, in North Lakhimpur district of Assam(India).

It is located at Falling Rain Genomics, Inc ‚Äì Ziro. Fallingrain.com. Retrieved on 23 February 2012. at an elevation of 1688 metres (5538 feet) to 2438 meters (8000 feet). Its cool weather in summer is its major attraction. It is famous for its surrounding pine-clad gentle hills and its rice fields. Ziro is home to the Apatani tribe. Culture Apatanis have few unique special characteristic features which differ from other tribes in Arunachal Pradesh and India. Few of these special characteristic features are: (A) Apatanis practice permanent wet paddy cultivation whereas other tribes practice shifting cultivation called Jhom cultivation. (B) Apatanis cultivate permanent wet land cultivations whereas other tribes practice dry land cultivations by clearing the forests by burning the jungles. (C) Apatanis once practiced the art of facial tattoos. Ziro is included as in India's Tentative List for UNESCO's World Heritage Site. Apatani tribal women in Hija Village, Ziro. Climate The climatic condition of the district varies from place to place as well as season to season. The climate is largely influenced by the nature of terrain depending upon altitude and location of the place. It may broadly be divided into four seasons in a year: # The cold weather season is from December to February # March to May is the pre-monsoon season of thunderstorms # The southwest monsoon from June to about the middle of October # The second half of October to November, which constitutes the post-monsoon or the retreating monsoon period and is a period of transition In the foothills or low high belt area of the district, the climatic condition is moderate in comparison to high belt areas, where during winter it is very cold and chilly, and in summer is pleasant. December and January are generally the coldest months, and July and August are warmest months. Annual rainfall in the south is heavier than that in the northern areas of the district. During the monsoon period, more than 70 percent of the rain over the southern half occurs while in the northern portions it is about 60 percent. Variability of rainfall for the monsoon and the year, as a whole, are relatively small. Average annual rainfall of the district headquarters, Ziro recorded as 934.88 cm during 2000. The relative humidity is always high throughout the year except in the winter months being slightly less humid. In the cold season, the sky is obscured on many mornings due to lifted fog which clears with the advance of the day generally, moderately clouded in the period of March to May, heavily clouded to overcast in the monsoon season and clear or slightly clouded during the post-monsoon season. Winds are generally light strong katabatic winds down the valleys are experienced as the local effect produced by the nature of the terrain. Demographics India census, Ziro had a population of 12,806. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. In Ziro, 17% of the population is under 6 years of age.

The original bequest stated that the holder must give two courses of twenty lectures each year, one in astronomy, and the other in geometry, and spend at least six weeks making astronomical observations. Originally the holder was elected by a committee consisting of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Privy Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Steward of the Household, and the Lord High Treasurer of the First Lord of the Treasury. By the 20th century, the electors had changed to comprise the most senior scientists in the United Kingdom: the President of the Royal Society, the President of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Astronomer Royal, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and the Lucasian, Sadleirian, and Plumian Professors.

She won a silver medal in the 400-metre individual medley at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, and two gold medals at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton. Since retiring from the sport, she has worked as a television presenter and served as a patron of charities for disabled children and fitness. She was also a contestant on Dancing on Ice 2010. Early life Sharron Davies was born in Plymouth, Devon, and grew up in Plymouth and Plymstock. She has twin brothers. She attended Plymstock Comprehensive School and the independent school Kelly College, which is now known as Mount Kelly, in Tavistock. She learnt to swim with Devonport Royal Swimming Association. She moved to Port of Plymouth Swimming Association when she was eight and was coached by Ray Bickley (ASA Coach) and Port of Plymouth Chief Coach, until 1978 when he became seriously ill. In 1978 her father Terry, worked under Ray Bickley learning coaching skills. Sharron Davies Against The Tide Willow Books 1984 Swimming She learned to swim at the age of six and was training seriously two years later. In her biography Against the Tide published in 1984, Davies records that 'being accepted into Ray's Port of Plymouth squad was one of the many watershed points of my career' she goes on to describe how 'he corrected all her bad habits and developed me into a four-stroke swimmer. Ray laid the foundations of the medley swimmer that was to blossom later'.Against the Tide Sharron Davies published Willow Books 1984 She set a record by swimming for the British national team at the age of only eleven. She was so determined that she continued her training even after breaking both her wrists in a childhood accident. In 1976, still only thirteen, Davies was selected to represent Great Britain at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Although her performance was not enough to get her in the medals, it did make her a household name. The next year she stepped up a gear to win two bronze medals in the 1977 European Championships. The following year, still just fifteen, she won gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in the 200 and 400-metre individual medleys. She also picked up a further silver and bronze medal. By 1980 Davies was ready for a more serious Olympic challenge. She took the silver medal in the 400 m individual medley behind East German Petra Schneider, who later admitted that the victory was drug enhanced. At the age of eighteen, Davies called time on the first stage of her swimming career to build her television profile and a career in modelling. In 1989, and training at Bracknell & Wokingham Swimming Club, she returned to the pool, where she picked up two more medals at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. By the time she finally retired for good in 1994, she had been a British champion on 22 occasions and had broken two hundred British swimming records and 5 World Masters records (eligible to those over 30).

Awards In the 1993 New Year Honours, Davies was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) \\"for services to swimming\\". Other activities In 2005, Davies supported the British Olympic bid by profile raising and appearing as spokesperson on BBC's Question Time where she made a strong case for bringing the games to London. Davies is a current patron of the Disabled Sport England and the Sports Aid Foundation. She is also the face of the Swim for Life charity event. Media career Bronze statue of a mermaid, modelled by Sharron Davies, on the sea wall of the Royal Yacht Squadron, Cowes, Isle of Wight. Davies's early ventures beyond swimming included appearing in a ski tuition video with world champion Franz Klammer, alongside fellow swimmer Duncan Goodhew. She also featured in the BBC's 1981 series \\"Sporting Superstars\\". In 1984 she appeared as the guest dart player, throwing for charity, on British game show Bullseye. She later joined the team of former British sports stars in presenting and commentating on sport coverage for the BBC. Initially this covered swimming but was extended to other sports for the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics. Davies caused a stir in the swimming community in 1994 when she headed a \\"British Girls of Sport\\" calendar. Instead of their usual functional sporting outfits, the athletes adopted a variety of sexy outfits to raise money for the Sports Aid Foundation. Davies had a breast enhancement operation after the birth of her first child and her figure was the subject of much tabloid gossip during the 2004 Olympic Games. Davies has published a number of health and fitness videos and co-authored books on the same topic. In 1995 she joined ITV's Gladiators being given the nickname Amazon. A knee injury forced her to withdraw from the gameshow in 1996. She later complained of the health and safety aspects of the show. In 1994, a documentary was made about Davies and Redmond for the Xpress TV series. It was produced and directed by Pogus Caesar for Windrush Productions and broadcast on Carlton TV. Also in 1996, Davies became a presenter of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. She continues to appear regularly as one of the BBC's main swimming commentators. Davies returned to British TV screens weekly from July 2008 as a joint host presenter along with Jim Rosenthal on Five's latest revival of the long running celebrity sports competition Superstars. She provided commentary for the BBC at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She was also a presenter at London's Olympics Handover Party in the Mall. In January 2010 Davies took part in the ITV series Dancing on Ice, partnered by regular participant Pavel Albrecht. She was eliminated on 21 February 2010 (Week 7 of the series). She also joined the BBC's swimming presenting team at the 2016 Summer Olympics alongside Helen Skelton, Rebecca Adlington and Mark Foster. Personal life In the 1980s, Davies lived with and was engaged to Neil Adams. an Olympic and World Championship medalist in judo. Davies then married physical training instructor John Crisp in West Sussex in 1987. They were divorced in 1991. In 1992, she met athlete Derek Redmond at the Barcelona Olympics. In 1994 they were married in Northampton, and had two children. They were divorced in 2000. Davies's third marriage was to British Airways pilot Tony Kingston. They were married in 2002 in Gloucestershire. In autumn 2006, she announced that she was three months pregnant after IVF treatment, having been trying for a baby for four years and suffering two miscarriages. During a Sport Relief event in Devon, she said: \\"We‚Äôre very optimistic and happy but we're cautious, too, because of what we have been through. Giving birth at 43 doesn‚Äôt worry me. I'm in better shape than most women 15 years younger. So many women go through this as they leave it later to have babies.\\" Davies gave birth to her third child on 30 January 2007. She split up with Kingston after seven years of marriage. Davies believes that trans women should not be allowed to compete in women's sports. Three national LGBT sports associations in the UK released a statement saying her comments were \\"deeply irresponsible transphobia\\". Her words were supported by Olympic medal-winning sports women Sally Gunnell, Nicola Adams, and Kelly Holmes.

The Four Corners Monument is where the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah meet. (The states are listed in clockwise order.) The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic and desert region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. This province covers an area of 336,700 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, northern Arizona, and a tiny fraction in the extreme southeast of Nevada. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries. The Colorado Plateau is largely made up of high desert, with scattered areas of forests. In the southwest corner of the Colorado Plateau lies the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. Much of the Plateau's landscape is related, in both appearance and geologic history, to the Grand Canyon. The nickname \\"Red Rock Country\\" suggests the brightly colored rock left bare to the view by dryness and erosion. Domes, hoodoos, fins, reefs, river narrows, natural bridges, and slot canyons are only some of the additional features typical of the Plateau. The Colorado Plateau has the greatest concentration of U.S. National Park Service (NPS) units in the country outside the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Among its nine national parks are Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, Arches, Mesa Verde, and Petrified Forest. Among its 18 national monuments are Bears Ears, Rainbow Bridge, Dinosaur, Hovenweep, Wupatki, Sunset Crater Volcano, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Natural Bridges, Canyons of the Ancients, Chaco Culture National Historical Park and the Colorado National Monument. Geography The Four Corners region and the Colorado Plateau. Click image to see state lines. The Book Cliffs of western Colorado. Green River runs north to south from Wyoming, briefly through Colorado, and converges with the Colorado River in southeastern Utah. Sunset in Ojito Wilderness, near Albuquerque, NM This province is bounded by the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and by the Uinta Mountains and Wasatch Mountains branches of the Rockies in northern and central Utah. It is also bounded by the Rio Grande Rift, Mogollon Rim and the Basin and Range Province. Isolated ranges of the Southern Rocky Mountains such as the San Juan Mountains in Colorado and the La Sal Mountains in Utah intermix into the central and southern parts of the Colorado Plateau. It is composed of six sections: * Uinta Basin Section * High Plateaus Section * Grand Canyon Section * Canyon Lands Section * Navajo Section * Datil Section As the name implies, the High Plateaus Section is, on average, the highest section. North-south trending normal faults that include the Hurricane, Sevier, Grand Wash, and Paunsaugunt separate the section's component plateaus. This fault pattern is caused by the tensional forces pulling apart the adjacent Basin and Range province to the west, making this section transitional. Occupying the southeast corner of the Colorado Plateau is the Datil Section. Thick sequences of mid-Tertiary to late-Cenozoic-aged lava covers this section. Development of the province has in large part been influenced by structural features in its oldest rocks. Part of the Wasatch Line and its various faults form the western edge of the province. Faults that run parallel to the Wasatch Fault that lies along the Wasatch Range form the boundaries between the plateaus in the High Plateaus Section. The Uinta Basin, Uncompahgre Uplift, and the Paradox Basin were also created by movement along structural weaknesses in the region's oldest rock. In Utah, the province includes several higher fault-separated plateaus: * Awapa Plateau * Aquarius Plateau * Kaiparowits Plateau * Markagunt Plateau * Paunsaugunt Plateau * Sevier Plateau * Fishlake Plateau * Pavant Plateau * Gunnison Plateau and the * Tavaputs Plateau. Some sources also include the Tushar Mountain Plateau as part of the Colorado Plateau, but others do not. The mostly flat-lying sedimentary rock units that make up these plateaus are found in component plateaus that are between above sea level. A supersequence of these rocks is exposed in the various cliffs and canyons (including the Grand Canyon) that make up the Grand Staircase. Increasingly younger east-west trending escarpments of the Grand Staircase extend north of the Grand Canyon and are named for their color: * Chocolate Cliffs, * Vermillion Cliffs, * White Cliffs, * Gray Cliffs, and the * Pink Cliffs. Within these rocks are abundant mineral resources that include uranium, coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Study of the area's unusually clear geologic history (which is laid bare due to the arid and semiarid conditions) has greatly advanced that science. A rain shadow from the Sierra Nevada far to the west and the many ranges of the Basin and Range means that the Colorado Plateau receives of annual precipitation. Higher areas receive more precipitation and are covered in forests of pine, fir, and spruce. Though it can be said that the Plateau roughly centers on the Four Corners, Black Mesa in northern Arizona is much closer to the east-west, north-south midpoint of the Plateau Province. Lying southeast of Glen Canyon and southwest of Monument Valley at the north end of the Hopi Reservation, this remote coal-laden highland has about half of the Colorado Plateau's acreage north of it, half south of it, half west of it, and half east of it. Human history The Ancestral Puebloan People lived in the region from roughly 2000 to 700 years ago. A party from Santa Fe led by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante, unsuccessfully seeking an overland route to California, made a five-month out-and-back trip through much of the Plateau in 1776‚Äì1777. Despite having lost one arm in the American Civil War, U.S. Army Major and geologist John Wesley Powell explored the area in 1869 and 1872. Using wooden oak boats and small groups of men the Powell Geographic Expedition charted this largely unknown region of the United States for the federal government. Construction of the Hoover Dam in the 1930s and the Glen Canyon Dam in the 1960s changed the character of the Colorado River. Dramatically reduced sediment load changed its color from reddish brown (Colorado is Spanish for \\"red\\") to mostly clear. The apparent green color is from algae on the riverbed's rocks, not from any significant amount of suspended material. The lack of sediment has also starved sand bars and beaches but an experimental 12-day-long controlled flood from Glen Canyon Dam in 1996 showed substantial restoration. Similar floods are planned for every 5 to 10 years. Geology The Redwall Limestone cliffs of the Colorado Plateau tower above the northern Mojave Desert.

MODIS satellite image of Grand Canyon, Lake Powell (black, left of center) and the Colorado Plateau. White areas are snow-capped. One of the most geologically intriguing features of the Colorado Plateau is its remarkable stability. Relatively little rock deformation such as faulting and folding has affected this high, thick crustal block within the last 600 million years or so, although there are some newer features such as the Waterpocket Fold of Capitol Reef (estimated 50‚Äì70 million years old). In contrast, provinces that have suffered severe deformation surround the plateau. Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth- stretching tension created the Basin and Range province to the west and south. Sub ranges of the Southern Rocky Mountains are scattered throughout the Colorado Plateau. The Precambrian and Paleozoic history of the Colorado Plateau is best revealed near its southern end where the Grand Canyon has exposed rocks with ages that span almost 2 billion years. The oldest rocks at river level are igneous and metamorphic and have been lumped together as Vishnu Basement Rocks; the oldest ages recorded by these rocks fall in the range 1950 to 1680 million years. An erosion surface on the \\"Vishnu Basement Rocks\\" is covered by sedimentary rocks and basalt flows, and these rocks formed in the interval from about 1250 to 750 million years ago: in turn, they were uplifted and split into a range of fault-block mountains. Erosion greatly reduced this mountain range prior to the encroachment of a seaway along the passive western edge of the continent in the early Paleozoic. At the canyon rim is the Kaibab Formation, limestone deposited in the late Paleozoic (Permian) about 270 million years ago. A extension of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains called the Uncompahgre Mountains were uplifted and the adjacent Paradox Basin subsided. Almost 4 mi. (6.4 km) of sediment from the mountains and evaporites from the sea were deposited (see geology of the Canyonlands area for detail). Most of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas and near-shore environments (such as beaches and swamps) as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-North America (for detail, see geology of the Grand Canyon area). The province was probably on a continental margin throughout the late Precambrian and most of the Paleozoic era. Igneous rocks injected millions of years later form a marbled network through parts of the Colorado Plateau's darker metamorphic basement. By 600 million years ago North America had been leveled off to a remarkably smooth surface. Throughout the Paleozoic Era, tropical seas periodically inundated the Colorado Plateau region. Thick layers of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale were laid down in the shallow marine waters. During times when the seas retreated, stream deposits and dune sands were deposited or older layers were removed by erosion. Over 300 million years passed as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated. It was not until the upheavals that coincided with the formation of the supercontinent Pangea began about 250 million years ago that deposits of marine sediment waned and terrestrial deposits dominate. In late Paleozoic and much of the Mesozoic era the region was affected by a series of orogenies (mountain-building events) that deformed western North America and caused a great deal of uplift. Eruptions from volcanic mountain ranges to the west buried vast regions beneath ashy debris. Short-lived rivers, lakes, and inland seas left sedimentary records of their passage. Streams, ponds and lakes created formations such as the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta in the Mesozoic era. Later a vast desert formed the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near-shore environment formed the Carmel (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area for details). The area was again covered by a warm shallow sea when the Cretaceous Seaway opened in late Mesozoic time. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm shallow waters of this advancing and retreating seaway. Several other formations were also created but were mostly eroded following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny closed the seaway and uplifted a large belt of crust from Montana to Mexico, with the Colorado Plateau region being the largest block. Thrust faults in Colorado are thought to have formed from a slight clockwise movement of the region, which acted as a rigid crustal block. The Colorado Plateau Province was uplifted largely as a single block, possibly due to its relative thickness. This relative thickness may be why compressional forces from the orogeny were mostly transmitted through the province instead of deforming it. Pre-existing weaknesses in Precambrian rocks were exploited and reactivated by the compression. It was along these ancient faults and other deeply buried structures that much of the province's relatively small and gently inclined flexures (such as anticlines, synclines, and monoclines) formed. Some of the prominent isolated mountain ranges of the Plateau, such as Ute Mountain and the Carrizo Mountains, both near the Four Corners, are cored by igneous rocks that were emplaced about 70 million years ago. Minor uplift events continued through the start of the Cenozoic era and were accompanied by some basaltic lava eruptions and mild deformation. The colorful Claron Formation that forms the delicate hoodoos of Bryce Amphitheater and Cedar Breaks was then laid down as sediments in cool streams and lakes (see geology of the Bryce Canyon area for details). The flat-lying Chuska Sandstone was deposited about 34 million years ago; the sandstone is predominantly of eolian origin and locally more than 500 meters thick. The Chuska Sandstone caps the Chuska mountains, and it lies unconformably on Mesozoic rocks deformed during the Laramide orogeny. Younger igneous rocks form spectacular topographic features. The Henry Mountains, La Sal Range, and Abajo Mountains, ranges that dominate many views in southeastern Utah, are formed about igneous rocks that were intruded in the interval from 20 to 31 million years: some igneous intrusions in these mountains form laccoliths, a form of intrusion recognized by Grove Karl Gilbert during his studies of the Henry Mountains. Ship Rock (also called Shiprock), in northwestern New Mexico, and Church Rock and Agathla, near Monument Valley, are erosional remnants of potassium-rich igneous rocks and associated breccias of the Navajo Volcanic Field, produced about 25 million years ago. The Hopi Buttes in northeastern Arizona are held up by resistant sheets of sodic volcanic rocks, extruded about 7 million years ago. More recent igneous rocks are concentrated nearer the margins of the Colorado Plateau. The San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff, south of the Grand Canyon, are volcanic landforms produced by igneous activity that began in that area about 6 million years ago and continued until 1064 CE, when basalt erupted in Sunset Crater National Monument. Mount Taylor, near Grants, New Mexico, is a volcanic structure with a history similar to that of the San Francisco Peaks: a basalt flow closer to Grants was extruded only about 3000 years ago (see El Malpais National Monument). These young igneous rocks may record processes in the Earth's mantle that are eating away at deep margins of the relatively stable block of the Plateau. Tectonic activity resumed in Mid Cenozoic time and started to unevenly uplift and slightly tilt the Colorado Plateau region and the region to the west some 20 million years ago (as much as 3 kilometers of uplift occurred). Streams had their gradient increased and they responded by downcutting faster. Headward erosion and mass wasting helped to erode cliffs back into their fault-bounded plateaus, widening the basins in-between. Some plateaus have been so severely reduced in size this way that they become mesas or even buttes. Monoclines form as a result of uplift bending the rock units. Eroded monoclines leave steeply tilted resistant rock called a hogback and the less steep version is a cuesta. Cliffs of Navajo Sandstone in Zion National Park Great tension developed in the crust, probably related to changing plate motions far to the west. As the crust stretched, the Basin and Range province broke up into a multitude of down-dropped valleys and elongate mountains. Major faults, such as the Hurricane Fault, developed that separate the two regions. The dry climate was in large part a rainshadow effect resulting from the rise of the Sierra Nevada further west. Yet for some reason not fully understood, the neighboring Colorado Plateau was able to preserve its structural integrity and remained a single tectonic block. A second mystery was that while the lower layers of the Plateau appeared to be sinking, overall the Plateau was rising. The reason for this was discovered upon analyzing data from the USARRAY project. It was found that the asthenosphere had invaded the overlying lithosphere, as a result of an area of mantle upwelling stemming from either the disintegration of the descending Farallon Plate, or the survival of the subducted spreading center connected to the East Pacific Rise and Gorda Ridge beneath western North America, or possibly both. The asthenosphere erodes the lower levels of the Plateau. At the same time, as it cools, it expands and lifts the upper layers of the Plateau. Eventually, the great block of Colorado Plateau crust rose a kilometer higher than the Basin and Range. As the land rose, the streams responded by cutting ever deeper stream channels. The most well-known of these streams, the Colorado River, began to carve the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago. The Pleistocene epoch brought periodic ice ages and a cooler, wetter climate. This increased erosion at higher elevations with the introduction of alpine glaciers while mid-elevations were attacked by frost wedging and lower areas by more vigorous stream scouring. Pluvial lakes also formed during this time. Glaciers and pluvial lakes disappeared and the climate warmed and became drier with the start of Holocene epoch. Ecology The Colorado Plateau is covered with dry grasslands and shrublands, open pinyon-juniper woodland, and mountain woodlands and forests. Energy generation Castle Gate Power Plant near Helper, UT. Carbon County, UT. Oil well in the Uinta Basin, Utah. Electrical power generation is one of the major industries that takes place in the Colorado Plateau region. Most electrical generation comes from coal fired power plants. Natural resources Petroleum The rocks of the Colorado Plateau are a source of oil and a major source of natural gas. Major petroleum deposits are present in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado, the Uinta Basin of Utah, the Piceance Basin of Colorado, and the Paradox Basin of Utah, Colorado, and Arizona. Uranium The Colorado Plateau holds major uranium deposits, and there was a uranium boom in the 1950s. The Atlas Uranium Mill near Moab has left a problematic tailings pile for cleanup, which is ongoing. Coal Major coal deposits are being mined in the Colorado Plateau in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, though large coal mining projects, such as on the Kaiparowits Plateau, have been proposed and defeated politically. The ITT Power Project, eventually located in Lynndyl, Utah, near Delta, was originally suggested for Salt Wash near Capitol Reef National Park. After a firestorm of opposition, it was moved to a less beloved site. In Utah the largest deposits are in aptly named Carbon County. In Arizona the biggest operation is on Black Mesa, supplying coal to Navajo Power Plant.

","title":"Colorado Plateau"},{"id":"649026","text":"Robert William \\"Bob\\" Latimer (born March 13, 1953) is a Canadian canola and wheat farmer who was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his daughter Tracy (November 23, 1980 ‚Äì October 24, 1993). This case sparked a national controversy on the definition and ethics of euthanasia as well as the rights of people with disabilities, and led to two Supreme Court decisions, R. v. Latimer (1997), on section 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and later R. v. Latimer (2001), on cruel and unusual punishments under section 12 of the Charter. Latimer was released on day parole in March 2008 and was granted full parole in December 2010. Farm and family Before his imprisonment, Latimer lived near Wilkie, Saskatchewan, on a wheat and canola farm with his wife, Laura, and their four children. Tracy Latimer Tracy Latimer was born November 23, 1980. An interruption in Tracy's supply of oxygen during the birth caused cerebral palsy, leading to severe mental and physical disabilities including violent seizures which were controlled with seizure medication. She had little or no voluntary control of her muscles, wore diapers, and could not walk or talk. Her doctors described the care given by her family as excellent. The Supreme Court judgment of 1997 noted, \\"It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain.\\" In her medical testimony Dr. Dzus, Tracy's orthopaedic surgeon, noted \\"the biggest thing I remember from that visit is how painful Tracy was. Her mother was holding her right leg in a fixed, flexed position with her knee in the air and any time you tried to move that leg Tracy expressed pain and cried out\\".She also noted that despite having a hip that had been dislocated for many months Tracy could not take painkillers because she was on anti-seizure medication which, in combination with painkillers, could lead to renewed seizures, stomach bleeding, constipation, aspiration and aspiration pneumonia.Examination-in-chief of Dr Anne K. Dzus, Latimer v. Her Majesty the Queen, Appellant's Record Book, File # 26980 Robert Latimer reported that the family was not aware of any medication other than Tylenol that could be safely administered to Tracy. Considering it too intrusive, the Latimers did not wish a feeding tube to be inserted, though according to the 2001 Supreme Court judgment, it might have allowed more effective pain medication to be administered and it might have improved her nutrition and health. During her life, Tracy underwent several surgeries, including surgery to lengthen tendons and release muscles, and surgery to correct scoliosis in which rods were inserted into her back. Tracy attended school regularly in Wilkie. People who worked with Tracy in group homes and schools described her smile, love of music and reaction to horses at the circus. According to the Crown prosecutors' brief presented at the second trial, \\"She also responded to visits by her family, smiling and looking happy to see them. There is no dispute that through her life, Tracy at times suffered considerable pain. As well, the quality of her life was limited by her severe disability. But the pain she suffered was not unremitting, and her life had value and quality.\\" In October 1993, Dr. Dzus recommended and scheduled further surgery on November 19, 1993, in the hope that it would lessen the constant pain in Tracy's dislocated hip. Depending on the state of her hip joint, the procedure might have been a hip reconstruction or it might have involved removing the upper part of her thigh bone, leaving the leg connected to her body by only muscles and nerves. The anticipated recovery period for this surgery was one year. The Latimers were told that this procedure would cause pain, and the doctors involved suggested that further surgery would be required in the future to relieve the pain emanating from various joints in Tracy's body.\\" Dr. Dzus reported that \\"the post operative pain can be incredible\\", and described the only useful short-term solution being the use of an epidural to anesthetize the lower part of the body and help alleviate pain while Tracy was still in hospital. Tracy's death On October 24, 1993, Laura Latimer found Tracy dead. She had died under the care of her father while the rest of the family was at church. At first, Latimer stated that Tracy had died in her sleep. When confronted by police with autopsy evidence that high levels of carbon monoxide were found in Tracy's blood, Latimer confessed that he had killed her by placing her in his truck and connecting a hose from the truck's exhaust pipe to the cab. He said he had also considered other methods of killing Tracy, including Valium overdose and \\"shooting her in the head\\". Latimer said his actions were motivated by love for Tracy and a desire to end her pain. He described the medical treatments Tracy had undergone and was scheduled to undergo as \\"mutilation and torture\\". \\"With the combination of a feeding tube, rods in her back, the leg cut and flopping around and bedsores, how can people say she was a happy little girl?\\" Latimer asked. Murder trials and appeals Latimer was charged with first- degree murder, convicted of second-degree murder by a jury, and sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 10 years. He subsequently lost an appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. In February 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear a further appeal; and in June 1996, the original Crown prosecutor was charged with attempting to obstruct justice through jury tampering. In February 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a new trial for Latimer because of the allegations of jury tampering, which began on 22 October 1997. Latimer was convicted of second-degree murder. The second trial judge had found that a 10-year sentence granted Latimer a constitutional exemption from the mandatory minimum sentence, sentencing Latimer to one year in prison followed by a year of probation, but the original conviction was upheld by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2001, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Latimer's crime could not be justified through the defence of necessity, and found that, despite the special circumstances of the case, the lengthy prison sentence given to Latimer was not cruel and unusual, and therefore not a breach of section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court also ruled that Latimer was not denied rights to jury nullification, as no such rights exist, and his prison sentence was thus upheld. Imprisonment and parole Latimer began serving his sentence on January 18, 2001, and was incarcerated at William Head Institution, a minimum-security facility located 30 kilometres west of Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. While in prison, he completed the first year of carpentry and electrician apprenticeships. He continued to run his family's farm with the help of a manager. On December 5, 2007, Robert requested day parole from the National Parole Board in Victoria. He told the parole board that he believed killing his daughter was the right thing to do. The board denied his request, saying that Latimer had not developed sufficient insight into his actions, despite psychological and parole reports that said he was a low risk to reoffend unless he was put into the same situation again.globeandmail.com: Latimer denied early prison release, by Justine Hunter In January 2008, lawyer Jason Gratl filed the appeal on Latimer's behalf, arguing that in denying parole, the board had violated its own rules by requiring admission of wrongdoing and by ignoring the low risk for reoffending. In February 2008, a review board overturned the earlier parole board decision, and granted Latimer day parole stating that there was low risk that Latimer would re-offend. Latimer was released from William Head Prison and began his day parole in Ottawa in March. On his release he stated that he planned to press for a new trial and for identification of the pain medication that the 2001 Supreme Court ruling suggested he could have used instead of killing his daughter. On November 29, 2010, Latimer was granted full parole. Latimer became eligible for full day parole in December 2010. Latimer's parole restrictions took effect on December 6, 2010.Latimer granted full parole. CBC News. retrieved Nov 29, 2010 In August 2010, an appeal was made to the Federal Court of Canada. Justice Mactavish ordered the board to reassess Latimer's application. The National Parole Board was also directed by the Judge to apply the least restrictive conditions consistent with society's protection. Latimer was assessed to have a low risk of re-offending. Latimer moved to Victoria, where he was required to live in a half-way house five days a week and an apartment two days a week. In July 2010, the National Parole Board denied his request to be allowed to leave the halfway house for five days a week. Public debate Support for Latimer A 1999 poll found that 73% of Canadians believed that Latimer acted out of compassion and should receive a more lenient sentence. The same poll found that 41% believe that mercy killing should be legal. Ethicist Arthur Schafer argued that Latimer was \\"the only person in Canadian history to spend even a single day in prison for a mercy killing\\" and that compassion and common sense dictated a reduced sentence and the granting of parole. In the introductory college coursebook, The Elements of Moral Philosophy, James Rachels and Stuart Rachels present Latimer's actions sympathetically.Rachels, James, and Rachels, Stuart, The Elements of Moral Philosophy, 5th edition (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007), pp. 8-11. Support for Latimer's conviction and sentence Numerous disability rights groups obtained intervenor status in the Latimer's appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that killing a disabled child like Tracy is no different from killing a non-disabled child and should carry the same penalty. To do otherwise, they argued, would devalue the lives of disabled people and increase the risk of more such killings by their caregivers. Religious groups representing the Roman Catholic church and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada also appeared as intervenors in Latimer's Supreme Court appeal. Latimer's 2007 application for day-parole was rejected primarily because he still denied any wrongdoing. Maclean's columnist Andrew Coyne argued that the National Parole Board was right to expect remorse on Latimer's part, because to do otherwise might inspire others to similar actions. In music In the song \\"Latimer's Mercy\\" from the album Scream, Ozzy Osbourne relates to the Latimer case.

The Montego was the replacement for both the rear-wheel drive Morris Ital and the front-wheel drive Austin Ambassador ranges to give British Leyland an all- new competitor for the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. On its launch, it was sold as an Austin and also an MG, and was the last new car to be launched with the use of the Austin marque. From 1988, it was sold without a marque following the phasing out of the Austin name. Design and development The Montego started life as a four-door notchback variant of project LC10. Development on the new model, intended to succeed both the Morris Marina and the Princess ranges by the turn of the 1980s, had begun in 1977 but ultimately the new car was not launched until seven years after development had started; in the meantime, the Marina had been updated and rebadged as the Morris Ital from 1980, whilst the Princess had been updated as the Austin Ambassador in 1982. The Honda-based Triumph Acclaim had also been introduced in 1981 largely as a stop-gap to keep potential buyers interested in BL products until both the Montego and the Rover 200 series were launched in 1984. The Austin Maestro emerged as the five-door hatchback variant. When the designs diverged, the Montego became project LM11 (the Maestro being LM10), and remained based on a lengthened version of the LC10s Volkswagen Golf style front MacPherson strut / rear twist beam chassis. The Montego received different front and rear styling following the replacement of designer David Bache with Roy Axe. It also featured body-coloured bumpers (as did the Maestro), and front wipers which hid themselves under the bonnet when parked. The Montego offered many improvements over the Maestro, many of which were later incorporated into the latter, such as a new SOHC engine (the S-series), and a more robust dashboard. As with the Maestro, there was a high-performance MG version which again used the solid-state instrument cluster, trip computer, and synthesised voice for the information and warning systems. The dashboard fitted to the Montego was superior to that originally designed for the Maestro and featured a rally- style tachometer, a service indicator and a representation of the car showing open doors, lights left on, etc. The estate version was competitively priced and achieved useful sales volumes in the UK and, perhaps more surprisingly, in France An estate variant, with larger luggage capacity than its competitors, two additional rear-facing child seats and self-levelling suspension, also styled by Roy Axe, followed shortly and received instant acclaim, winning the company a Design Council award. There were originally plans to name it the Rover 400 series, and pre‚Äìproduction cars in Warwickshire were seen bearing \\"ROVER\\" badges, and badged as 413i, 416i, 420 and 420i. The unrelated 400 series launched in April 1990 while from 1995, a decade after the Montego was introduced, the 416i and 420i names would be used, but on the unrelated second-generation Rover 400 series, by that time, the Montego was already out of production. To market More performance was offered in 1985 from a turbocharged Montego, badged as an MG The Montego was launched on 25 April 1984. It was initially available as a four-door saloon only, filling the gap in the range left by the discontinuation of the Morris Ital saloon two months earlier. However, it would be produced alongside the Ital estate until that model was axed in August 1984. The estate variant was launched at the British International Motor Show in October of that year. The MG turbocharged variant was released in early 1985 as the fastest production MG ever with a 0-60 mph time of 7.3 seconds, and a top speed of . The Vanden Plas version, and featured leather seats, walnut veneer and features such as electric windows, central locking and power door mirrors. Like the Maestro, the Montego suffered from its overly long development phase, which had been begun in 1975 and which was hampered throughout by the industrial turmoil that plagued both British Leyland and Austin Rover Group during this period. The Ryder Report had recommended the costly modernization of both the Longbridge and Cowley factories, and since Longbridge was to come on stream first - the Austin Metro was put in production first, even though its design had been started after the Maestro/Montego. As a direct result of this delay, the two cars were now stylistically out of step, having been styled by several different designers - Ian Beech, David Bache, Roger Tucker and finally, Roy Axe, had all contributed to the Montego's styling. Arguably, both the Maestro and Montego had been compromised by the reuse of a single platform, doors and wheelbase to bridge two size classes - a mistake that BMC/BL had made before with the Austin 1800 and the Austin Maxi in the 1960s. Indeed, Roy Axe, when installed as Austin Rover's director of design in 1982, was so horrified by the design of the Maestro and Montego when he first viewed them in prototype form he recommended that they be scrapped and the whole design exercise restarted. A 1990 Rover Montego 1.6LX saloon A 1993 Rover Montego Estate Countryman The last Montego at the British Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon 1993 Montego Turbo Diesel Like many BL cars before it, early Montegos suffered from build quality and reliability problems which badly damaged the car's reputation amongst the public. In some ways, the technology was ahead of its time, notably the solid- state instrumentation and engine management systems, but the \\"talking\\" dashboard fitted to high-end models (and initially used to promote the Montego as an advanced high-tech offering) was prone to irritating faults and came to be regarded as something of an embarrassment by BL and the British press. This feature was discontinued after a short period. There were also problems with the early sets of body-coloured bumpers which tended to crack in cold weather at the slightest impact. The Montego was heavily dependent on its home British market for sales, and in particular the lucrative fleet sector where it competed directly with both the Ford Sierra and General Motors' Vauxhall Cavalier. By virtue of their wealthy American parent companies, and their much deeper market penetration into continental Europe compared to BL, both Ford and Vauxhall could afford to offer deep discounts to fleets to increase sales and market share. Also, thanks to Britain's membership of the European Economic Community, both Ford and General Motors could import cars tariff-free from their continental plants to take advantage of exchange rate fluctuations and further undercut BL. This practice greatly damaged sales of the Montego, and its smaller Maestro sister, and only compounded the early issues with build quality and reliability. Later developments Development on the Montego continued. A replacement was proposed by Roy Axe in 1986, which would have been the existing Montego core structure clothed with new outer panels to mimic the design language set by the recently launched Rover 800-series, and would have been designated the Rover 400-series. This concept, designated AR16 and planned to go into production around 1989, would have also spawned a five- door hatchback version (designated AR17) to increase Rover's options in its rivalry with the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. The AR16/17 concepts were however abandoned in November 1988 due to lack of funds, and a facelift to the existing car (designated AR9) released in 1988 enhanced its appeal, which was buoyed up by both the Perkins-engined diesel model, and the seven-seater version of the \\"Countryman\\" estate. The 2-litre turbodiesel (often known by its Perkins designation 'Prima') was a development of the O-Series petrol engine already used in the range. The diesel saloon won a CAR magazine 'giant test' against the Citro√´n BX (1.8 XUDT), the then new Peugeot 405 (1.8 XUDT) and Audi 80 (1.6) turbo diesels. They rated the 405 the best car, followed by the BX and then the Montego, with the Audi coming in last. \\"But if people buy diesels, and turbo diesel for their economy, the winner has to be the Montego. ...its engine is - even when roundly thrashed - more than 10% more economical than the rest. For those isolated moments when cost control is not of the essence, the Montego is a car you can enjoy too. The steering and driving position are quite excellent. ...the suspension as 'impressively refined'. It is silent over rough bumps, poised and well damped.\\" The turbo diesel became a favourite of the RAF for officer transport. Car Mechanics Magazine ran a de- mobbed RAF officer transport Montego bought from a Ministry of Defence auction in 1996. The facelift also saw the phasing out of the Austin name. These late-1980s models had a badge resembling the Rover Viking longship, but it was not identical, nor did the word \\"Rover\\" ever appear on the cars. Though the car failed to match its rivals, such as the Volkswagen Passat, the car sold well to the likes of the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. By the early 1990s, the Montego was terminally aged and its popularity was dwindling, although this was offset by the popularity of new cars like the second generation Rover 200 series, and its saloon equivalent, the Rover 400 Series. Saloon production finished in early 1993 on the launch of the Rover 600 Series. The estate continued until December 1994, almost a year after Rover's takeover by BMW. The second generation Rover 400 Series was launched shortly afterwards as a hatchback and a saloon, further filling the gaps in the Rover range left by the phasing-out of the Montego. In its final year, What Car? magazine said \\"Austin Rover's once 'great white hope', Montego matured into a very decent car -- but nobody noticed\\". The chassis development for the Montego and Maestro's rear suspension was used as a basis for later Rover cars, and was well regarded. Montegos continued to be built in small numbers in CKD form at the Cowley plant in Oxford until 1994, when production finally ended. The last car was signed by all those that worked on it, and is now on display at the British Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon, Warwickshire. A total of 546,000 Austin/Rover Montegos and 23,000 MG Montegos were produced, with Britain by far being the biggest market for the car. As of 2019 only around 135 Montegos remain on British roads from the total number sold in the UK with most surviving examples residing with classic car owners. In all, 436,000 Montegos were sold in the UK between 1984 and 1995. In August 2006, a survey by Auto Express revealed that the Montego was Britain's eighth-most scrapped car of the last 30 years, with just 8,988 still in working order. Contributing to this, areas of the bodywork that were to be covered by plastic trim (such as the front and rear bumpers) were left unpainted and thus unprotected. In addition, pre-1989 models fitted with the A and S-series engines cannot run on unleaded petrol without the cylinder head being converted or needing fuel additives.http://fbhvc.co.uk/fuel-information/ Fuel additives This led to many owners simply scrapping the cars, as leaded petrol was removed from sale in Britain after 1999, and by 2003 most petrol stations had stopped selling LRP (lead replacement petrol) due to falling demand as the number of cars requiring it declined. The Austin Montego, like many other Austin Rover cars at the time, offered a high luxury model. Sold opposite the MG, the Montego Vanden Plas was the luxury alternative. The Vanden Plas featured leather seats and door cards (velour in the estate version), powered windows, mirrors, door locks and sunroof. Alloy wheels were offered and later became standard on all cars. An automatic gearbox was also offered. It was available in both saloon and estate bodystyles. All Vanden Plas Montegos were 2.0 litres, either EFi (electronic fuel injection) or standard carburettor engines. International markets Europe The Montego was sold in several continental European markets. In France, the Estate was particularly popular. New Zealand MG Montego 2.0 SL wagon, New Zealand In New Zealand, the Austin Montego was launched in 1984. The only models available were the manual 2.0-litre HLS or Mayfair versions, and only in estate form. The sedan version was not offered in New Zealand due to concerns that it would compete directly with the Honda Accord, locally assembled by the New Zealand Motor Corporation, which had changed from assembling BL to Honda models. Also available from 1987 the Montego sedan was sold in the Vanden Plas range with the 2.0-litre fuel- injected motor. From about 1989 onwards, a wider range of models were imported by a new company, Rover New Zealand; this included sedan versions for the first time. Also new were the MG 2.0 range (identical to the MG Montego sold in the UK), and all wore the official MG badge. The main Auckland dealer developed an air conditioning system as an option for these models in conjunction with local specialists.Classic and Sports Car A-Z of Cars of the 1980s, Martin Lewis, Bay View Books Ltd, 1998, page 91 China A version of the Austin Maestro with a Montego front end was briefly built in China by FAW, as the Lubao CA 6410 and as the Jiefang CA 6440 UA Van. This was after the rights to the Montego and Maestro had been sold by Etsong in 2003, who had been manufacturing Maestro variants earlier. India The Montego Estate was sold in India as the Rover Montego in collaboration with Sipani Automobiles - (the company that tried and failed to market the Reliant Kitten in India - a version of the Robin with four wheels and Triumph-inspired front suspension - as the Sipani Dolphin). The car was not a success, selling only 287 examples before being discontinued. Taiwan From the mid 1980s until the early 1990s, a local importer sold the Montego along with the Mini and Maestro under Austin, then Rover badge. Trinidad and Tobago From 1997‚Äì2000, a private importer sold the Montego in this Caribbean nation under the Rover badge. Build quality was poor and the company soon folded.

The projects main task is to provide a small Linux system that turns almost every machine into a router. The distribution can run from a floppy disk and was created with the aim of simple configuration and support for older hardware. fli4l can route between Ethernet and ISDN, DSL or UMTS, or just between Ethernet networks. Characteristics and requirements fli4l is based on the Linux kernel. As the documentation is very extensive no knowledge of Linux is required, however a basic knowledge of network technology is needed.fli4l documentation: Introduction The hardware requirements for fli4l are low, an Intel Pentium with MMX support and 64 MiB RAM and (depending upon the configuration) one or two network interface controllers is quite adequate. A hard disk drive is not required, but can be used by fli4l too.fli4l documentation: Setup Flavours Newer versions of fli4l provide also the possibility to create a working installation on a CF card in a card reader, which card then in turn can operate from a CF adapter in an IDE slot. Also the generation of an ISO image is supported to run from a CD-ROM as well as from DOC/DOM for Embedded systems. fli4l can be configured on Linux, Unix and Windows systems using just text files.fli4l documentation: Configuration In addition, fli4l has the possibility to encrypt connections over the Internet or via Wireless LAN using OpenVPN or PPTP (Poptop).Poptop Versions There are two development branches for fli4l, a stable and a development version. The present stable release is based on a Linux 3.16 kernel and supports virtualization by means of Xen and KVM. USB and Wireless LAN are supported to a great extent as well as current embedded hardware as APU, ALIX, Soekris, and EPIA series. The 4.0 development version also provides a Linux 4.1 kernel. Furthermore, it implements a new management and configuration layer for connections (so-called circuits) which has been designed from the ground up. It allows to use multiple WAN links (e.g. via DSL, ISDN, or UMTS) in parallel. Optional packages fli4l is a modular system using so-called OPT-packages. To create an individual configuration, only software packages for those options, that are needed, are downloaded and unzipped into the directory tree. To extend the basic functionality, a wide range of applications is available in the so-called OPT-database;The fli4l database for additional packages for example, optional packages can be used for monitoring traffic or an fli4l can function as a printserver. This process easily allows own developments, that can be made available to other users via the OPT-database. Device control An fli4l router can be controlled and monitored with a browser-based interface. Besides, the program imonc (isdn monitor client) is available for Windows and Linux (GTK). imonc allows extensive control as well as remote- controlled update of the router's software.imonc References Further reading  * External links * * Heating system using 1-Wire Bus with fli4l Category:Light-weight Linux distributions Category:Gateway/routing/firewall distribution Category:Free routing software ","title":"Fli4l"},{"id":"649056","text":"The Cavendish Professorship is one of the senior faculty positions in physics at the University of Cambridge. It was founded on 9 February 1871 alongside the famous Cavendish Laboratory, which was completed three years later. William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire endowed both the professorship and laboratory in honor of his relative, chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish. History Creation of the Cavendish Laboratory The old Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England Before the middle of the nineteenth century, science was largely pursued by individuals, either wealthy amateurs or academics working in their college accommodation. In 1869, a committee formed by the Senate reported that creating a dedicated Laboratory and Professorship would cost ¬£6,300. The then chancellor of the university, William Cavendish met that cost privately 18 months later, and named the department in honor of his relative, the 18th century natural philosopher Henry Cavendish. James Clerk Maxwell The first Cavendish Professor was the then relatively obscure James Clerk Maxwell, who had yet to complete the work that would make him the most renowned physicist of the nineteenth century. His appointment was announced on 8 March 1871, and despite initial disappointment at his being offered the place, his inaugural lecture was looked forward to by his likely students as well as his future colleagues. However, it was poorly advertised, so it was only to his students that he laid out his plans for physics at Cambridge. When Maxwell began the actual course a few days later with a lecture on heat, it was attended by academics in formal dress, in the belief that it was the first lecture. Maxwell spent the next three years supervising the construction of the dedicated Cavendish Laboratory, and published in 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. Maxwell's health deteriorated a short time into his tenure, and he died in 1879, aged 48. Lord Rayleigh Lord Rayleigh replaced Maxwell immediately upon his death, being universally agreed upon as the only successor. Raleigh spent ¬£1500 updating the laboratory, and created a new practical course, revolutionising practical instruction, and in 1882 he allowed women to take the course as well. In his five years as Cavendish Professor, he published 50 papers and expanded the number of students to 48. J. J. Thomson J. J. Thomson was made Cavendish Professor in 1884 at the age of 28, leading one senior member of the University to comment that \\"Matters have come to a pretty pass when they elect mere boys Professors.\\" In 1895, a change was made to the university regulations which allowed students who had not studied at Cambridge to receive a B.A. by submitting a thesis which was judged \\"of distinction as a record of original research.\\" Among the students attracted by this change was future Cavendish Professor Ernest Rutherford. Whilst Thomson was Cavendish Professor, he discovered the electron and the existence of isotopes, and also fostered an atmosphere of friendliness and mutual helpfulness. Ernest Rutherford Rutherford returned to Cambridge in 1918, and spent the last 19 years of his life there. This was around the time of the change from classical to modern physics, and Rutherford was something of a contradiction, dressing as a Victorian gentleman but working on the cutting edge of physics. Rutherford died suddenly in 1937, marking the end of an era for the Cavendish. William Lawrence Bragg Sir Lawrence Bragg became Cavendish Professor just before the outbreak of the Second World War, which resulted in many staff joining various defence research establishments, notably to develop radar. Work on neutron physics performed at this time was translated into the Manhattan Project to build an atom bomb. Nevill Francis Mott In 1971 it was renamed from the \\"Cavendish Professorship of Experimental Physics\\" to the \\"Cavendish Professorship of Physics\\". Until Brian Pippard became the Cavendish Professor in 1971, the holder was also the head of the Physics Department.

She became the second person of Hong Kong origin (the first was Lawrence Kadoorie, Baron Kadoorie) and the first female ethnic Chinese Hongkonger to be elevated to the peerage as a life peeress with the title and style of Baroness in 1990. Launching her career in British firms Swire Group and HSBC Group, she was an Unofficial Member and then the Senior Member of the Executive Council and Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, witnessing the major events of Hong Kong including the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. She is best known in Hong Kong for her part in (unsuccessfully) lobbying for the people of Hong Kong to have the right of abode in the United Kingdom after the Handover of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, and she remained influential until her retirement from Hong Kong politics in 1995. From 1990 to 2010, she also served as a member of the House of Lords, the first person ethnic Chinese to assume such position. She resigned from the House of Lords in 2010 following the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 which effectively disallows \\"Non-Doms\\" from sitting in either House of the British Parliament. Early life, business and public career Dunn was born in Hong Kong to refugee parents from China. She was educated at the St. Paul's Convent School in Hong Kong, and at the College of the Holy Names and at the University of California, Berkeley. Upon her return to Hong Kong, she was hired by the Swire Group where she kept rising to the directorships of the John Swire and Sons (HK) Ltd., Swire Pacific Ltd., and Cathay Pacific Airways. In 1981, she became the first woman to sit on the director board of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. From 1992 to 2008, she was the bank's deputy chairman. Dunn also served on many public positions, including the chairmanship of the Trade Development Council from 1983 to 1991. In that capacity, she led missions abroad to promote Hong Kong textile and clothing products as well as stood firm against protectionism in her report for the Trade Policy Research Centre in 1983 on 'Protectionism and the Asian-Pacific Region'. She was also the director of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation from 1979 to 1985 and served as the chairman of the Prince Philip Dental Hospital from 1981 to 1987, during the formative years of the University of Hong Kong‚Äôs Faculty of Dentistry. Political career Dunn first entered Hong Kong politics when she was made an Unofficial Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in 1976 by Governor Murray MacLehose. In 1982, she was made an Unofficial Member of the Executive Council by Governor Edward Youde. During the Sino-British negotiations over the transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty to China in the early 1980s, Dunn participated as a member of the delegations of Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, led by Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive Council Sir Sze-yuen Chung, who travelled to London and Beijing to meet with Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. The aims of the members were to raise the concerns of the Hong Kong people and to negotiate for a better deal for Hong Kong. However, Beijing authorities rejected their suggestion that Hong Kong people had an independent role to play in the negotiations. From 1985 to 1988, Dunn was the Senior Member of the Legislative Council. In 1988, she succeeded Chung to become the Senior Member of the Executive Council. After the signing of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which ensured Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997, Dunn urged the British government to grant Hong Kong residents the right of abode in Britain. She is best remembered in Hong Kong for breaking down in tears while giving testimony before a British parliamentary committee that was examining the Hong Kong question in May 1989 amidst the tumultuous Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China. Dunn said the British government would be \\"morally indefensible\\" for surrendering \\"British citizens to a regime that did not hesitate to use its tanks and forces on its own people\\". Britain refused to change its restrictive nationality policy, but eventually allowed about 50,000 Hong Kong families to become British citizens through the British Nationality Selection Scheme in 1990 in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre. That year, Dunn was appointed to the House of Lords in 1989. In May 1989, Dunn and several other Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils presented the Basic Law Drafting Committee with a proposal for an \\"OMELCO Consensus\\" model for the post-1997 process of electing the Chief Executive, providing a moderate alternative to those put forth by the pro-democracy camp and the conservative hardliners from the business and professional community. However, following Beijing's disapproval of the \\"OMELCO Consensus\\", Dunn softened her tone. In a House of Lords debate in 1992, Dunn described having more directly elected seats as \\"unwise\\" and talked of it as \\"reviving uncertainty, tension and discord in our community.\\" She also said that \\"for the British Government to put a request to the Chinese Government, asking for democracy -- that, too, will be improper.\\" Following Chris Patten's arrival in Hong Kong as the colony's last governor in 1992, Dunn supported his proposal of separating the Executive Council from the Legislative Council so as to allow for more checks and balances. After a reshuffling of the Executive Council, Dunn became its sole remaining member. Subsequently, she became more outwardly discreet during the Patten governorship. It was widely speculated that she had lost her political influence due to her disagreement with the governor over his more confrontational approach in dealing with the Chinese as compared to her consensual approach. In 1995, Dunn announced that she was retiring from Hong Kong politics, fueling speculation in the media over whether she still believed in the territory's future after 1997. While former British-appointed politicians found new favour with Beijing authorities in the run-up to 1997, Dunn bucked the trend by reinforcing her ties to Britain, retaining her seat in the House of Lords and maintaining high-profile positions in British companies, including HSBC Holdings. In 1996, she relocated to Britain with her British husband Michael Thomas, the former Attorney General of Hong Kong. Dunn rarely sat or spoke in the House of Lords during her years as a peer. After the passage of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, she resigned from the British upper house in 2010 to preserve her \\"Non-Dom\\" status. Personal life Dunn is married to Michael David Thomas, former Attorney General of Hong Kong in 1988. She has four stepchildren from Thomas's previous marriage. She has reportedly been living in London since 1996. In 2010, Dunn auctioned 160 items from her private art collection at Christie's, with lots reportedly valued at up to GBP30,000 (HK$354,000) each. Honours For her services to Hong Kong, Dunn was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1978, and then a CBE (Commander) in 1983. In 1989, she was appointed DBE (Dame Commander), reportedly the first from Hong Kong to have such an honour. One year later, she became the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman Hongkonger to be elevated to the British peerage in the Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs 1990 Birthday Honours. She was introduced to the House of Lords as Baroness Dunn, of Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong and of Knightsbridge in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea on 24 August 1990. Dunn was also awarded the Prime Minister of Japan's Trade Award in 1987 and the United States' Secretary of Commerce award in 1988. In 1991, she was conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Hong Kong. She also received Doctor of Science honoris causa by the University of Buckingham in 1995.

He was originally from Bargjin, but he settled in the village of Mullet, Albania and probably served as a Janissary, he was given the title Pasha. As an ethnic Albanian, he had fought for the Ottomans against the Safavids in Persia. After that he had built a mosque (the Sylejman Pasha Mosque), a bakery and a hammam ( Islamic sauna). He founded the settlement of Tirana, now the capital of Albania, in 1614 as an oriental-style town of those times. According to some legends, he named the town he founded after Tehran, the capital of Persia (nowadays Iran). With Suleymans foundations, Tirana soon became the center of Albanian art, culture and religion (especially with the Spread of Islam and the Bektashi Sufism), it became famous because of its strategic position at the heart of Albania.

History Habitation by Native Americans The river valleys and lower levels of the range were occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Historic tribes of the region included the Walla Walla, Cayuse people and Umatilla, now acting together as the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, located mostly in Umatilla County, Oregon. The southern portion of the Blue Mountains were inhabited by several different bands of the Northern Paiute, a Great Basin culture. Native American tribes originally migrated to the Blue Mountains for hunting and salmon runs. The Natives used to purposefully burn small parts of the forest in order to create pastures to attract game for hunting. During westward expansion of the United States A party descending the Blue Mountains in their journey along the Oregon Trail. Drawing from Eleven years in the Rocky Mountains and a life on the frontier by Frances Fuller Victor (1877). In the mid-1800s, the Blue Mountains were a formidable obstacle to settlers traveling on the Oregon Trail and were often the last mountain range American pioneers had to cross before either reaching southeast Washington near Walla Walla or passing down the Columbia River Gorge to the end of the Oregon Trail in the Willamette Valley near Oregon City. Modern travel The range is currently traversed by Interstate 84, which crosses the crest of the range at a summit, from south-southeast to north- northwest between La Grande and Pendleton. The community of Baker City is located along the south-eastern flank of the range. U.S. Route 26 crosses the southern portion of the range, traversing the Blue Mountain Summit and reaching an elevation of . It is also crossed by the Union Pacific Railroad's mainline between Portland, Oregon and Pocatello, Idaho, which crests the summit at Kamela, Oregon. The summit lies on Union Pacific's La Grande Subdivision, which runs between La Grande and Hinkle, the latter of which is the site of a major UP yard.  Wildlife  Birds of the area include bald eagle, northern spotted owl, Lewis's woodpecker, Williamson's sapsucker, red- breasted nuthatch, golden-crowned kinglet and many migratory species, with the riverbanks important habitat for this birdlife. Mammals that move through the mountain grasslands include Rocky Mountain elk (including the largest herd in North America at Hells Canyon), bighorn sheep and mule deer. Native fish include Chinook Salmon, Steelhead, Redband Trout, Coho Salmon, Bull Trout, and Pacific Lamprey. The Blue Mountains in Washington are home to one of 10 identified elk herds in the state, with a population of approximately 4,500 Rocky Mountain elk as of 2018 across the region. In 1989, in response to a decline in the elk population and a heavy female-biased population, the Washington Fish & Wildlife Department regulated elk hunting in the Washington Blue Mountains with a \\"spike-only\\" general hunting season, permitting hunting of only male elk with at least one visible non-branched antler. By the mid 1990s the area then became known for its mature males and trophy hunting. In 2018, Washington State proposed an updated elk management plan intended to improve the health of elk populations and habitats, reduce human conflict and agricultural damage, and managing elk populations for recreational, educational, scientific, and ceremonial purposes. During winter months elk will prefer to use \\"moderately steep south slopes\\" rather than northern slopes because of the southern slopes being warmer and containing less snow.  Land management  The public lands in the Blue Mountains are managed not only by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, but also by land owners and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Location Much of the range is included in the Malheur National Forest, Umatilla National Forest, and Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest. Several wilderness areas encompass remote parts of the range, including the North Fork Umatilla Wilderness, the North Fork John Day Wilderness, the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness, and the Monument Rock Wilderness, all of which are in Oregon. The Wenaha‚ÄìTucannon Wilderness sits astride the Oregon‚ÄìWashington border. Drainage The range is drained by several rivers, including the Grande Ronde and Tucannon, tributaries of the Snake, as well as the forks of the John Day, Umatilla and Walla Walla rivers, tributaries of the Columbia. The southernmost portion of the Blue Mountains is drained by the Silvies River, in the endorheic Harney Basin.

Michener, published in 1971 by Random House.\\"20th-Century American Bestsellers\\". Welcome to the ISRL. Web. 02 Nov. 2009 The novel follows six young characters from diverse backgrounds and various countries as their paths meet and they travel together through parts of Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Mozambique. The story is told from the perspective of the narrator, George Fairbanks, who is an investment analyst for the fictional company World Mutual Bank in Switzerland. Mr. Fairbanks is connected with nearly every character in some way, and they all seem to open up to him throughout the novel in one way or another. Plot summary Chapter I: Joe In the first chapter, Joe is introduced as a disenfranchised twenty-year-old youth who is enrolled at the University of California during the Vietnam War. After Joe realizes that with his grades he is going to get drafted, he hitchhikes to Yale University, where he gets the name of a professor who may be able to get him across the border into Canada. After being referred to a woman in Boston named Gretchen, she helps him get into Canada, and he eventually goes to Torremolinos, Spain. While looking for a job and a place to stay, he takes over the ownership of a bar called The Alamo, and a man named Jean-Victor finds him a place to stay in Torremolinos. Chapter II: Britta In keeping with the theme throughout the book, the second chapter is about the character Britta, an 18-year-old girl from Troms√∏, Norway. After finishing school, she finds a job in an office at the docks, but eventually becomes curious about the world beyond Troms√∏, and goes to vacation in Torremolinos, Spain for fifteen days. Once in Torremolinos, she loves it and finds a job as a waitress in a bar called The Alamo. Here, a man named Jean-Victor finds her a place to stay, where another newcomer to Torremolinos, Joe, is already staying. Chapter III: Monica Of the main characters in the book, Monica goes through trials and tribulations as she transitions from living as royalty in a foreign country to being forced out and finally finding her way to Torremolinos to join the rest of the cast in the book. She is introduced as living with her father in the Republic of Vwarda, where Monica becomes rebellious and begins to cause a stir in Vwarda's Royal Family. She is forced out of the country and runs away with an airline pilot to Torremolinos, where she can live on her monthly allowance from her grandmother. She meets a man named Jean-Victor, who finds her a place to live with a woman from Norway and a man from the United States. Chapter IV: Cato The fourth character of the book is Cato; he is introduced as the son of the Reverend Claypool Jackson, a local minister in the area trying to salvage his community through his church. Cato Jackson is a sophomore at University of Pennsylvania, whom the narrator meets at a drugstore where he stumbles upon a shooting of a local drugstore owner. After meeting Mr. Fairbanks, he and Cato talk all night and the next day, after Cato's girlfriend is stabbed and killed. Cato then runs off to Torremolinos, where he finds shelter in an apartment with a few other runaways of his own age. Chapter V: Yigal In the fifth chapter of the book, the character Yigal is introduced as the son of a dean at a college in Haifa, Israel. He is struggling to identify with either his parents and their life in Israel, or with his grandfather and his American life in Detroit, Michigan in the United States, and his other grandfather in England. He is shuffled between Israel and America throughout his youth, and even fights and becomes a hero in the Six-Day War, before finally enrolling in Technion University in Haifa. After a few months he moves back to England with his other grandfather and begins to engage in a lot of reading and in conversations with his grandfather. Eventually his grandfather suggests that he needs to spend some time away, and he suggests the south of Spain, and Torremolinos, as a place to go. Chapter VI: Gretchen Gretchen is introduced as a very intelligent girl from Boston who, at the age of 19, has already completed her bachelor's degree, and is working for senator Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign. After campaigning across the United States for McCarthy's nomination in Chicago at the Democratic Convention, during the riots she and the people she is with are falsely arrested. During the process she is sexually assaulted, but the policemen who did it deny it, and nothing is ever done about it. After fighting with her parents and the police over the issue of what happened, she decides to go to school in Besan√ßon, France, where one of her professors tells her about an excellent language school. Upon enrolling at the University of Besan√ßon and living with her peers for a little while, she decides to travel. Someone suggests Torremolinos, so she buys a yellow pop-top van and begins to live out of it in Torremolinos. Chapter VII: Torremolinos At the beginning of the chapter seven, the whole set of characters are all in Torremolinos, and everyone is getting settled in with their various living conditions. Cato and Monica begin a relationship, and some of the characters begin to experiment with drugs such as LSD; they continue to smoke large amounts of marijuana and drink regularly. During this time, they go to Paxton Fell's house, a man whom a few of the characters were referenced to see in case of an emergency. Everyone, including Mr. Fairbanks, who is in Torremolinos to supervise a real estate deal, end up partying with Mr. Fell and a few of his guests throughout the night. Eventually, during their stay, the characters are approached by a woman, Susan Elgerton, who tries to convince Cato and Gretchen to join her in the name of starting a violent revolution back in America. As time goes on, Torremolinos begins to lose its luster; Monica is partying too much for her own good and Gretchen starts to look for something else to entertain her, and the characters leave Torremolinos in Gretchen's yellow pop-top and head towards Portugal. Chapter VIII: Algarve As they drive towards the Algarve, the characters begin to notice that not everywhere in Europe is so nice as Torremolinos. They eventually find a small town by the name of Alte. Here, Yigal meets a local girl whom he kisses, upsetting the rest of the village, and Monica and Cato keep on going to the nearby town of Albufeira to take doses of LSD with a local bar owner, where Gretchen also tries it for the first time and unfortunately has a really bad trip. Eventually the group moves on to the seaside town of Algarve. After living in Algarve for a while, Monica tries to run away to Nepal, but Joe, Yigal and Cato end up getting into a fight with the people with whom she was going to run away. She returns, and the crew heads off to Pamplona, Spain with Mr. Fairbanks. Chapter IX: The Tech Rep In the ninth chapter, a new character is introduced by the name of Harvey Holt. He works as a technical representative on radars in remote locations. He is an old friend of Mr. Fairbanks, and has been everywhere; from Afghanistan to Sumatra to Thailand. He is a fan of old music and movies. He is very old-fashioned, and in a break from the rest of the characters in the book, he isn't vehemently anti-war, as he had served in World War II. He very much disapproves of how Joe dodged the draft to travel the world. Harvey's old music tapes include the vocalist Bea Wain; her recording of \\"My Reverie\\", discussed in two separate chapters, serves as a symbol of the generation gap. Chapter X: Pamplona Pamplona is known for its Running of the Bulls, an event characters come to see. They stay in the same hotel as Mr. Fairbanks and Harvey Holt, and there are many conversations between Mr. Holt and Joe about commitment to one's country. Here, Gretchen starts to show her feelings for Clive, a recurring character throughout the book who brings news from the outside world as well as new music from his homeland in England. For a week, everybody enjoys themselves, and Joe begins to think that he also wants to run with the bulls with Harvey at some point. During the week, Yigal's American grandfather tracks him down and tries to bring him back to Detroit with him, although he is torn because he doesn't like America, although something in it still has him interested. In the end, he leaves to go to school at Case Western Reserve in Ohio. During the run, Harvey gets gored by a bull but survives. Joe and even Mr. Fairbanks run, and the gang decides next to leave Europe and head to Mozambique for the next leg of their journey. Chapter XI: Mozambique In Mozambique things begin to go downhill for Monica: she has moved beyond LSD, begins to use heroin regularly, starts to bring Cato down with her, and gets Joe to try heroin on occasion. Cato hangs around the local historians in the area, and begins to learn about the history of Africa, and the effect slavery has had on the continent. As quick as Cato is to point out how badly the Christians have treated the Arabs, Mr. Fairbanks and Gretchen are quick to point out how much the Arabs used slavery against their own people in the past. The group also explores some of the natural beauty of Mozambique, and starts to reconnect with that side of the world, which is something they have not explored thus far on their journey. The group then decides to head to Marrakesh, Morocco, where there is a man who could help out Joe with some papers, so he could re-enter the United States at some point, and not be considered a criminal. Chapter XII: Marrakesh In the final destination of the journey, the remainder of the group ends up in Marrakesh, Morocco, where the marijuana trade is booming, a town where young people could get lost very easily. The group finds a place to stay at a hotel, where on the top floor there is a man who can help out Joe with his papers, and helps out people who become addicted to heroin, which makes it a good fit for Monica. Monica is becoming more addicted to heroin, and things are starting to look bad for her. Her father has all but given up hope for her, and the rest of the group is beginning to split up; Britta and Harvey fly off to Ratmalana, and Monica runs away more often than before. Eventually, Monica dies from an infection caused by her heroin use, Britta leaves with Harvey, Cato begins his trip to Mecca hoping to return to Philadelphia, Joe goes off to Tokyo and Gretchen returns home to Boston.

The community, with a population of 179 as of 2016,Population of Bamfield. 2016 Census data. is divided by Bamfield Inlet.  History  Bamfield was populated by Huu-ay-aht of the Nuu-chah-nulth, the local indigenous people. Europeans founded a small fishing community sometime in the late 1800s. Most of the indigenous people now live in the neighbouring village of Anacla about 5 kilometres from Bamfield. Bamfield was named after the first government agent of the area, William Eddy Banfield. The name \\"Bamfield\\" with an \\"m\\" is said to be either due to how the local first nations people had trouble pronouncing the letter n in his name, or a mistake made by the postal organization. In 1902, the Bamfield cable station was constructed as the western terminus of a worldwide undersea telegraph cable called by some the All Red Line as it passed only through countries and territories controlled by the British Empire, which were coloured red on the map. The cable initially went to Fanning Island, a tiny coral atoll in the mid-Pacific, and from there continued to Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia. On May 16, 1915, American newspapers reported that an enemy Demo team had tried to land at Bamfield but was scared off by the military guards. A second building, made of concrete, was built on the site in 1926 to replace the old wood structure. This building, designated a historic site in 1930, is now used by the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. During the early years of World War II, Cable & Wireless' cable station was shelled by an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine from nearby Barkley Sound without any major damage being inflicted, however the Canadian Government arranged for a company of troops to be based there until the end of that conflict. A Marine and Fisheries lifesaving station on the Pacific coast was established at Bamfield in 1907. It was the first lifesaving station on Canada's Pacific Coast. In 1953 the cable was extended up the Alberni Inlet to Port Alberni and the local station was closed on June 20, 1959. Following the closure, only the large concrete building, two cable storage tanks and an adjacent building survived, as all the rest were demolished. In 1968, the National Research Council asked five western Canadian universities (University of British Columbia, University of Victoria, University of Calgary, University of Alberta and Simon Fraser University) to propose the best location for a marine biology station on the Pacific Coast. Although Victoria was the earlier winner, a feasibility study tendered in 1969 recommended Bamfield as the better location. The former cable station property was purchased in 1969 and a formal structure for the management and development of the station was created in 1970 when the five universities ratified a Constitution and joined the Western Canadian Universities Marine Biological Society. In 1971, development began to convert the site into a research station. With most of the physical facilities completed, the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre began operations by the end of 1972. It became the largest employer in the community since. Commercial fishing was based in Bamfield up to the mid-1980s. Bamfield is now home to several sport fishing lodges, which pursue primarily salmon and halibut. Bamfield is also the northern terminus of the West Coast Trail, a hiking trail built in 1907 along the west coast of Vancouver Island to help survivors of the area's many shipwrecks find their way back to civilization. The trail runs along extremely rugged terrain. Today Bamfield is primarily a tourist destination, either for the West Coast Trail, ocean kayaking or sport fishing. The research activities at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre attracts hundreds of researchers every year. The Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre also offers credited university courses through its five associated universities. An out reach program, which provides multi-day immersion field trips for school, college and adult learners, also bring thousands of visitors to the community every year.

The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which produces a (3:1) ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, the two enantiomers of amphetamine. Both enantiomers are stimulants, but differ enough to give Adderall an effects profile distinct from those of racemic amphetamine or dextroamphetamine, which are marketed as Evekeo and Dexedrine/Zenzedi, respectively. Adderall is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer, cognitive enhancer, appetite suppressant, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine class. Adderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects. The two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which results in part from their interactions with human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. Dextroamphetamine is a more potent stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life (i.e., it remains in the body longer) than dextroamphetamine. The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the treatment response in some individuals relative to dextroamphetamine alone. Adderall's active ingredient, amphetamine, shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human trace amines, particularly phenethylamine and , the latter of which is a positional isomer of amphetamine. In 2017, Adderall was the 27th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 24 million prescriptions. Uses Medical Adderall is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder). =Available forms= Adderall is available as immediate-release (IR) tablets or two different extended-release (XR) formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally used in the morning. A shorter, 12-hour extended-release formulation is available under the brand Adderall XR and is designed to provide a therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses 4 hours apart. The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the immediate and extended release formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug. Enhancing performance Adderall has been banned in the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). In leagues such as the NFL, there is a very rigorous process required to obtain an exemption to this rule even when the athlete has been medically prescribed the drug by their physician. Recreational Adderall has high potential for misuse as a recreational drug. Adderall tablets can be crushed and snorted, or dissolved in water and injected. Injection into the bloodstream can be dangerous because insoluble fillers within the tablets can block small blood vessels. Many postsecondary students have reported using Adderall for study purposes in different parts of the developed world. Among these students, some of the risk factors for misusing ADHD stimulants recreationally include: possessing deviant personality characteristics (i.e., exhibiting delinquent or deviant behavior), inadequate accommodation of special needs, basing one's self-worth on external validation, low self-efficacy, earning poor grades, and suffering from an untreated mental health disorder. Contraindications Adverse effects The adverse side effects of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of substance consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious adverse drug effects than dosages used for therapeutic purposes. Overdose Interactions * Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) taken with amphetamine may result in a hypertensive crisis if taken within two weeks after last use of an MAOI type drug. * Inhibitors of enzymes that directly metabolize amphetamine (particularly CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong the elimination of amphetamine and increase drug effects. * Serotonergic drugs (such as most antidepressants) co-administered with amphetamine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. * Stimulants and antidepressants (sedatives and depressants) may increase (decrease) the drug effects of amphetamine, and vice versa. * Gastrointestinal and urinary pH affect the absorption and elimination of amphetamine, respectively. Gastrointestinal alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase (decrease) the absorption of amphetamine. Urinary alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase concentration of non-ionized (ionized) species, decreasing (increasing) urinary excretion. * Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) modify the absorption of Adderall XR and Mydayis. * Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of ADHD. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Amphetamine, the active ingredient of Adderall, works primarily by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It also triggers the release of several other hormones (e.g., epinephrine) and neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin and histamine) as well as the synthesis of certain neuropeptides (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptides). Both active ingredients of Adderall, dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, bind to the same biological targets, but their binding affinities (that is, potency) differ somewhat. Dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are both potent full agonists (activating compounds) of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and interact with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), with dextroamphetamine being the more potent agonist of TAAR1. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces more stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects. It has been reported that certain children have a better clinical response to levoamphetamine. In the absence of amphetamine, will normally move monoamines (e.g., dopamine, histamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.) from the intracellular fluid of a monoamine neuron into its synaptic vesicles, which store neurotransmitters for later release (via exocytosis) into the synaptic cleft. When amphetamine enters a neuron and interacts with VMAT2, the transporter reverses its direction of transport, thereby releasing stored monoamines inside synaptic vesicles back into the neuron's intracellular fluid. Meanwhile, when amphetamine activates , the receptor causes the neuron's cell membrane-bound monoamine transporters (i.e., the dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter, or serotonin transporter) to either stop transporting monoamines altogether (via transporter internalization) or transport monoamines out of the neuron; in other words, the reversed membrane transporter will push dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin out of the neuron's intracellular fluid and into the synaptic cleft. In summary, by interacting with both VMAT2 and TAAR1, amphetamine releases neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (the effect from VMAT2) into the intracellular fluid where they subsequently exit the neuron through the membrane-bound, reversed monoamine transporters (the effect from TAAR1). Pharmacokinetics Pharmacomicrobiomics Related endogenous compounds History, society, and culture History The pharmaceutical company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory withdrawal from the market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years. In 1994 Richwood Pharmaceuticals acquired Rexar and began promoting Obetrol as a treatment for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase \\"A.D.D. for All\\" intended to convey that \\"it was meant to be kind of an inclusive thing\\" for marketing purposes. The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal warning letter for the violations), then later issued a second formal warning letter to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of \\"the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD&C; Act\\". Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution of a large number of issues related to the company's numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved drug product. In 1997 Richwood Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in a $186 million transaction. Richwood Pharmaceuticals, which later merged with Shire plc, introduced the current Adderall brand in 1996 as an instant-release tablet. In 2006, Shire agreed to sell rights to the Adderall name for the instant-release form of the medication to Duramed Pharmaceuticals. DuraMed Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2008 during their acquisition of Barr Pharmaceuticals, including Barr's Duramed division. The first generic version of Adderall IR was introduced to market in 2002. Later on, Barr and Shire reached a settlement agreement permitting Barr to offer a generic form of the extended-release drug beginning in April 2009. Commercial formulation Chemically, Adderall is a mixture of four amphetamine salts; specifically, it is composed of equal parts (by mass) of amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and dextroamphetamine saccharate. This drug mixture has slightly stronger effects than racemic amphetamine due to the higher proportion of dextroamphetamine. Adderall is produced as both an immediate release (IR) and extended release (XR) formulation. , ten different companies produced generic Adderall IR, while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Actavis, and Barr Pharmaceuticals manufactured generic Adderall XR. , Shire plc, the company that held the original patent for Adderall and Adderall XR, still manufactured brand name Adderall XR, but not Adderall IR. Comparison to other formulations Adderall is one of several formulations of pharmaceutical amphetamine, including singular or mixed enantiomers and as an enantiomer prodrug. The table below compares these medications (based on US approved forms): Legal status * In Canada, amphetamines are in Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and can only be obtained by prescription. * In Japan, the use, production, and import of any medicine containing amphetamine are prohibited. * In South Korea, amphetamines are prohibited. * In Taiwan, amphetamines including Adderall are Schedule 2 drugs with a minimum five years prison term for possession. Only Ritalin can be legally prescribed for treatment of ADHD. * In Thailand, amphetamines are classified as Type 1 Narcotics. * In the United Kingdom, amphetamines are regarded as Class B drugs. The maximum penalty for unauthorized possession is five years in prison and an unlimited fine. The maximum penalty for illegal supply is 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. * In the United States, amphetamine is a Schedule II prescription drug, classified as a stimulant. * Internationally, amphetamine is in Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

The designation E7 comes from the Cartan‚ÄìKilling classification of the complex simple Lie algebras, which fall into four infinite series labeled An, Bn, Cn, Dn, and five exceptional cases labeled E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. The E7 algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases. The fundamental group of the (adjoint) complex form, compact real form, or any algebraic version of E7 is the cyclic group Z/2Z, and its outer automorphism group is the trivial group. The dimension of its fundamental representation is 56. Real and complex forms There is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E7, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 133. The complex adjoint Lie group E7 of complex dimension 133 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 266. This has fundamental group Z/2Z, has maximal compact subgroup the compact form (see below) of E7, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation. As well as the complex Lie group of type E7, there are four real forms of the Lie algebra, and correspondingly four real forms of the group with trivial center (all of which have an algebraic double cover, and three of which have further non- algebraic covers, giving further real forms), all of real dimension 133, as follows: * The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which has fundamental group Z/2Z and has trivial outer automorphism group. * The split form, EV (or E7(7)), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(8)/{¬±1}, fundamental group cyclic of order 4 and outer automorphism group of order 2. * EVI (or E7(-5)), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(2)¬∑SO(12)/(center), fundamental group non-cyclic of order 4 and trivial outer automorphism group. * EVII (or E7(-25)), which has maximal compact subgroup SO(2)¬∑E6/(center), infinite cyclic fundamental group and outer automorphism group of order 2. For a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the list of simple Lie groups. The compact real form of E7 is the isometry group of the 64-dimensional exceptional compact Riemannian symmetric space EVI (in Cartan's classification). It is known informally as the \\"\\" because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the quaternions and the octonions, and is also known as a Rosenfeld projective plane, though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the magic square, due to Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits. The Tits‚ÄìKoecher construction produces forms of the E7 Lie algebra from Albert algebras, 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebras. E7 as an algebraic group By means of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra, one can define E7 as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù) adjoint form of E7. Over an algebraically closed field, this and its double cover are the only forms; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or ‚Äútwists‚Äù of E7, which are classified in the general framework of Galois cohomology (over a perfect field k) by the set H1(k, Aut(E7)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E7 (see below) has no automorphisms, coincides with H1(k, E7, ad). (original version: ), ¬ß2.2.4 Over the field of real numbers, the real component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E7 coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned above, but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all adjoint forms of E7 have fundamental group Z/2Z in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit exactly one double cover; the further non-compact real Lie group forms of E7 are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations. Over finite fields, the Lang‚ÄìSteinberg theorem implies that H1(k, E7) = 0, meaning that E7 has no twisted forms: see below. Algebra Dynkin diagram The Dynkin diagram for E7 is given by 120px. Root system 231 polytope represent the root vectors of E7, as shown in this Coxeter plane projection Coxeter‚ÄìDynkin diagram: thumb300pxShown in 3D projection using the basis vectors [u,v,w] giving H3 symmetry: u = (1, œÜ, 0, -1, œÜ, 0,0) v = (œÜ, 0, 1, œÜ, 0, -1,0) w = (0, 1, œÜ, 0, -1, œÜ,0) The projected 231 polytope vertices are sorted and tallied by their 3D norm generating the increasingly transparent hulls of each set of tallied norms. These show: 1) 2 points at the origin 2) 2 icosahedrons 3) 1 icosadodecahedron 4) 2 dodecahedrons 5) 1 icosadodecahedron for a total of 126 vertices. Even though the roots span a 7-dimensional space, it is more symmetric and convenient to represent them as vectors lying in a 7-dimensional subspace of an 8-dimensional vector space. The roots are all the 8√ó7 permutations of (1,‚àí1,0,0,0,0,0,0) and all the \\\\begin{pmatrix}8\\\\4\\\\end{pmatrix} permutations of (¬Ω,¬Ω,¬Ω,¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω) Note that the 7-dimensional subspace is the subspace where the sum of all the eight coordinates is zero. There are 126 roots. The simple roots are :(0,‚àí1,1,0,0,0,0,0) :(0,0,‚àí1,1,0,0,0,0) :(0,0,0,‚àí1,1,0,0,0) :(0,0,0,0,‚àí1,1,0,0) :(0,0,0,0,0,‚àí1,1,0) :(0,0,0,0,0,0,‚àí1,1) :(¬Ω,¬Ω,¬Ω,¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω,‚àí¬Ω) They are listed so that their corresponding nodes in the Dynkin diagram are ordered from left to right (in the diagram depicted above) with the side node last. =An alternative description= An alternative (7-dimensional) description of the root system, which is useful in considering as a subgroup of E8, is the following: All 4\\\\times\\\\begin{pmatrix}6\\\\2\\\\end{pmatrix} permutations of (¬±1,¬±1,0,0,0,0,0) preserving the zero at the last entry, all of the following roots with an even number of +¬Ω :\\\\left(\\\\pm{1\\\\over 2},\\\\pm{1\\\\over 2},\\\\pm{1\\\\over 2},\\\\pm{1\\\\over 2},\\\\pm{1\\\\over 2},\\\\pm{1\\\\over 2},\\\\pm{1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right) and the two following roots :\\\\left(0,0,0,0,0,0,\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\right). Thus the generators consist of a 66-dimensional so(12) subalgebra as well as 64 generators that transform as two self-conjugate Weyl spinors of spin(12) of opposite chirality, and their chirality generator, and two other generators of chiralities \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{2}. Given the E7 Cartan matrix (below) and a Dynkin diagram node ordering of: 120px :one choice of simple roots is given by the rows of the following matrix: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&-1&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&1&-1&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&1&-1&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&1&-1&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&1&0 \\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&-\\\\frac{1}{2}&\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&-1&0 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Weyl group The Weyl group of E7 is of order 2903040: it is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the unique simple group of order 1451520 (which can be described as PSp6(2) or PSŒ©7(2)). Cartan matrix Hasse diagram of E7 root poset with edge labels identifying added simple root position :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Important subalgebras and representations E7 has an SU(8) subalgebra, as is evident by noting that in the 8-dimensional description of the root system, the first group of roots are identical to the roots of SU(8) (with the same Cartan subalgebra as in the E7). In addition to the 133-dimensional adjoint representation, there is a 56-dimensional \\"vector\\" representation, to be found in the E8 adjoint representation. The characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula. The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are : : _1_ , 56, _133_ , 912, _1463_ , _1539_ , 6480, _7371_ , _8645_ , 24320, 27664, _40755_ , 51072, 86184, _150822_ , _152152_ , _238602_ , _253935_ , _293930_ , 320112, 362880, _365750_ , _573440_ , _617253_ , 861840, 885248, _915705_ , _980343_ , 2273920, 2282280, 2785552, _3424256_ , 3635840... The underlined terms in the sequence above are the dimensions of those irreducible representations possessed by the adjoint form of E7 (equivalently, those whose weights belong to the root lattice of E7), whereas the full sequence gives the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simply connected form of E7. There exist non-isomorphic irreducible representation of dimensions 1903725824, 16349520330, etc. The fundamental representations are those with dimensions 133, 8645, 365750, 27664, 1539, 56 and 912 (corresponding to the seven nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order chosen for the Cartan matrix above, i.e., the nodes are read in the six-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third). E7 Polynomial Invariants E7 is the automorphism group of the following pair of polynomials in 56 non-commutative variables. We divide the variables into two groups of 28, (p, P) and (q, Q) where p and q are real variables and P and Q are 3√ó3 octonion hermitian matrices. Then the first invariant is the symplectic invariant of Sp(56, R): :C_1 = pq - qp + Tr[PQ] - Tr[QP] The second more complicated invariant is a symmetric quartic polynomial: :C_2 = (pq + Tr[P\\\\circ Q])^2 + p Tr[Q\\\\circ \\\\tilde{Q}]+q Tr[P\\\\circ \\\\tilde{P}]+Tr[\\\\tilde{P}\\\\circ \\\\tilde{Q}] Where \\\\tilde{P} \\\\equiv \\\\det(P) P^{-1} and the binary circle operator is defined by A\\\\circ B = (AB+BA)/2. An alternative quartic polynomial invariant constructed by Cartan uses two anti- symmetric 8x8 matrices each with 28 components. : C_2 = Tr[(XY)^2] - \\\\dfrac{1}{4} Tr[XY]^2 +\\\\frac{1}{96}\\\\epsilon_{ijklmnop}\\\\left( X^{ij}X^{kl}X^{mn}X^{op} + Y^{ij}Y^{kl}Y^{mn}Y^{op} \\\\right) Chevalley groups of type E7 The points over a finite field with q elements of the (split) algebraic group E7 (see above), whether of the adjoint (centerless) or simply connected form (its algebraic universal cover), give a finite Chevalley group. This is closely connected to the group written E7(q), however there is ambiguity in this notation, which can stand for several things: * the finite group consisting of the points over Fq of the simply connected form of E7 (for clarity, this can be written E7,sc(q) and is known as the ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù Chevalley group of type E7 over Fq), * (rarely) the finite group consisting of the points over Fq of the adjoint form of E7 (for clarity, this can be written E7,ad(q), and is known as the ‚Äúadjoint‚Äù Chevalley group of type E7 over Fq), or * the finite group which is the image of the natural map from the former to the latter: this is what will be denoted by E7(q) in the following, as is most common in texts dealing with finite groups. From the finite group perspective, the relation between these three groups, which is quite analogous to that between SL(n, q), PGL(n, q) and PSL(n, q), can be summarized as follows: E7(q) is simple for any q, E7,sc(q) is its Schur cover, and the E7,ad(q) lies in its automorphism group; furthermore, when q is a power of 2, all three coincide, and otherwise (when q is odd), the Schur multiplier of E7(q) is 2 and E7(q) is of index 2 in E7,ad(q), which explains why E7,sc(q) and E7,ad(q) are often written as 2¬∑E7(q) and E7(q)¬∑2. From the algebraic group perspective, it is less common for E7(q) to refer to the finite simple group, because the latter is not in a natural way the set of points of an algebraic group over Fq unlike E7,sc(q) and E7,ad(q). As mentioned above, E7(q) is simple for any q, and it constitutes one of the infinite families addressed by the classification of finite simple groups. Its number of elements is given by the formula : :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{gcd}(2,q-1)}q^{63}(q^{18}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{10}-1)(q^8-1)(q^6-1)(q^2-1) The order of E7,sc(q) or E7,ad(q) (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(2, q‚àí1) . The Schur multiplier of E7(q) is gcd(2, q‚àí1), and its outer automorphism group is the product of the diagonal automorphism group Z/gcd(2, q‚àí1)Z (given by the action of E7,ad(q)) and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order f if q = pf where p is prime). Importance in physics N = 8 supergravity in four dimensions, which is a dimensional reduction from 11 dimensional supergravity, admit an E7 bosonic global symmetry and an SU(8) bosonic local symmetry. The fermions are in representations of SU(8), the gauge fields are in a representation of E7, and the scalars are in a representation of both (Gravitons are singlets with respect to both). Physical states are in representations of the coset . In string theory, E7 appears as a part of the gauge group of one the (unstable and non-supersymmetric) versions of the heterotic string. It can also appear in the unbroken gauge group in six-dimensional compactifications of heterotic string theory, for instance on the four-dimensional surface K3.

Category:Lie groups Category:Exceptional Lie algebras ","title":"E7 (mathematics)"},{"id":"649120","text":"Cutthroat Island is a 1995 adventure swashbuckler film directed by Renny Harlin and written by Robert King and Marc Norman based on a story by Michael Frost Beckner, James Gorman, Bruce A. Evans, and Raymond Gideon. It stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, and Frank Langella. The film is an international co-production among companies in the United States, France, Germany, and Italy. The film had a notoriously troubled and chaotic production, involving multiple rewrites and recasts, and received negative reviews for the script, acting, and unrealistic stunts, whereas the high production values, action sequences, shooting locations, and the musical score were praised. It was a box office bomb, having one of the highest losses when adjusted for inflation in film history at $147 million. It even appeared in the Guinness World Records for being the biggest box-office bomb of all-time and led to the pirate genre's demise at that point, until Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. It was the final film from Carolco Pictures before its closure. Plot In 1668 Jamaica, Morgan Adams hunts down her uncle and fellow pirate Dawg Brown, who has captured her father, Black Harry. Black Harry has one of three pieces of a map to a huge stash of gold on the remote Cutthroat Island. Dawg has another piece, having stolen it from the corpse of a third brother, Richard, while a fourth brother, Mordechai, has the last piece. Harry refuses to give Dawg his piece and escapes with Morgan's help, but not before being mortally wounded. A dying Harry reveals to his daughter the location of the map piece: on his scalp. After scalping her dead father for the piece, Morgan, now the captain of her father's ship, the Morning Star, sets out for the treasure. Unfortunately, the instructions appear to be in Latin, which no one on board reads. So, they go to nearby Port Royal to find a translator. There, they learn that one of the slaves up for auction, a con man and thief named William Shaw, is fluent in Latin. After threatening a man determined to outbid her, Morgan wins the auction. Unfortunately, she is recognized from her wanted poster and is chased out of town, along with her crew and Shaw. Humiliated, corrupt Governor Ainslee vows to find her, either to arrest her or form a partnership for half her profits. He enlists the help of chronicler John Reed, who often follows pirates to write his books. The crew then goes to Mordechai in Spittlefield Harbor. Before they can learn where the second piece is, Dawg appears. A fight ensues, during which Mordechai is killed and Morgan is shot, while Shaw secretly finds the piece and keeps it to himself. After they escape on the Morning Star, Morgan collapses from her wound, but is saved by Shaw, who is a self-proclaimed doctor. The two start a romance. Morgan figures out that the words on the map, when read backwards, spell out half the coordinates to the island. Dawg's ship, the Reaper, bears down on them. Morgan directs hers toward a coral reef and a gale. Shaw manages to piece together the location of Cutthroat Island with his and Morgan's piece, but is caught and thrown in the brig. During the storm, Reed sends a carrier pigeon revealing their location to Ainslee. Meanwhile, the majority of the crew led by the treacherous Scully mutinies and maroon Morgan and those loyal to her in a boat. The tide takes them straight to Cutthroat Island, which is uncharted land northeast of Cuba. As Morgan goes after the treasure, Shaw, who escaped during the storm, steals the last piece from Dawg, who's on the island. Shaw falls into quicksand and Morgan, realizing he has the piece, frees him. Together, they find the gold, only for it to be stolen by Dawg, forcing them to jump off a cliff into the tide. After regaining consciousness, Shaw finds Reed, who leads him into a trap set by Dawg, Ainslee, and the mutineers, who have joined forces and intend to split the gold between them. As Shaw is captured and they make their way out to sea with the gold, Morgan sneaks aboard the Morning Star and retakes it from Scully and the mutineers. The crew then tries to sneak attack the Reaper, but Dawg counterattacks. A sea fight ensues, during which Shaw escapes and Ainslee, his men and Reed are killed by cannon fire. Morgan boards the Reaper and blows out the ship's bottom to get to the gold. She then duels Dawg while Shaw gets trapped below in rapidly rising water with the treasure. Morgan kills Dawg with a cannon and saves Shaw, forced to abandon the treasure to escape the sinking ship. Morgan attached a marker barrel to the treasure beforehand, allowing them to retrieve it and the newly rich crew sets sail for their next adventure in Madagascar.

Harlin convinced producer Mario Kassar to cast Davis, who was known for light comedies, in hopes that it would turn her into an action-adventure star. Carolco, already deeply in debt when the film entered pre-production, initially budgeted $60 million for Cutthroat Island and pinned its hopes for survival on the success of the film. To fund this endeavor, the cash-starved company cancelled its only other project under production, Crusade starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, losing $13 million in the process but freeing up additional money for Cutthroat Island. It also sold a $20 million interest in Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, Last of the Dogmen, and Stargate,Prince, pp. 148-149. and aggressively marketed Cutthroat Island to overseas distributors, who were convinced to buy the distribution rights in their various countries with the promise that the film was a sure-fire hit. Casting Michael Douglas originally agreed to play Shaw under two conditions: filming had to start immediately because he was available only for a limited time, and his character had to have the same amount of screen time as Davis. Douglas eventually pulled out, claiming that Davis's role was expanded at his character's expense, while Davis wanted to quit when Douglas did, but was contractually obligated to finish the film. After Douglas quit, Harlin was so preoccupied with trying to find a male lead that set construction and script work were done without his input. Consequently, Harlin did not like what he saw when shooting was set to begin, leading to expensive rebuilding and rewriting. Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson, Jeff Bridges, Ralph Fiennes, Charlie Sheen, Michael Keaton, Tim Robbins, Daniel Day-Lewis and Gabriel Byrne all turned down the role of Shaw before Modine agreed to do the role, partly due to his experience as a fencer. Oliver Reed was originally cast for a cameo as Mordechai Fingers, but was fired after getting in a bar fight and attempting to expose himself to Davis while intoxicated.Hall of infamy No 21: Oliver Reed George Murcell eventually took his place. Filming Shooting was delayed for various reasons, allowing the budget to spiral out of control. When Harlin fired the chief camera operator following a dispute, more than two dozen crew members quit. In addition, broken pipes caused raw sewage to pour into the water tank where the actors were supposed to swim. Harlin spent $1 million of his own money to rewrite the script, as Carolco was in so much debt that they could not afford to pay further. The first week into production, the film's original cinematographer, Oliver Wood, fell off a crane and into one of the water tanks, breaking his leg; he had to be replaced by cinematographer Peter Levy. The film was shot on location in Malta and Thailand. Indoor scenes were shot at Mediterranean Film Studios in Kalkara, Malta, and models were shot at the Paddock Tank at Pinewood Studios, in Iver Heath, England. Harlin required actors to do their own stunts whenever possible. While promoting the film, Davis appeared on talk shows with clips of her doing stunts over and over (including one take where she fell out of a window too soon, rolled down the roof and under a carriage) and described the bruises and injuries she sustained while filming. Music The film's orchestral score was composed by John Debney. It is one of the film's aspects that has been critically acclaimed, compared with the classic works of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Release Box office Cutthroat Island had a total production budget of $98 million (though some put the figure as high as $115 million) and the total U.S. gross was $10,017,322. In 2014, the LA Times listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time. as well as making the Guinness World Record as the biggest box-office bomb of all-time. It debuted at No. 13 at the US box office. Critical reception The film received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 38% rating based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 4.43/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Cutthroat Island may aspire towards the earnest thrills of classic swashbucklers, but a distinct lack of charm and stilted script make this adventure a joyless hodgepodge of the pirate genre's flotsam and jetsam.\\" Critics were also unimpressed with the lack of chemistry between the leading actors, the one-dimensional villain, the unrealistic stunts (particularly a scene where Adams and Shaw jump through a scaffolding several stories high and come out unharmed) and the incoherent script. Todd McCarthy from Variety said: \\"What seemed like a dubious proposition on paper plays even more dubiously onscreen, as Cutthroat Island strenuously but vainly attempts to revive the thrills of old-fashioned pirate pictures. Giving most of the swashbuckling opportunities to star Geena Davis, pic does little with its reversal of gender expectations and features a seriously mismatched romantic duo in Davis and Matthew Modine.\\" Time Out London commented that \\"we get Geena Davis doing the all-action honours, and a hotchpotch script that seems to think pirate movies are so funny in themselves the need for more humour is superfluous. The plot's well worn\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times said that \\"It's not possible to believe that Ms. Davis is the highly respected captain of a pirate ship, and it's not even fun to try.\\" By contrast, Roger Ebert gave the film a three-out-of-four-star rating, commenting: \\"This is, in short, a satisfactory movie ‚Äì but it doesn't transcend its genre, and it's not surprising or astonishing. I saw it because that was my job and, having seen it, I grant its skill, and award it three stars on that basis. But unless you're really into pirate movies, it's not a necessary film.\\" Susan Wloszczyna from USA Today stated: \\"If the sight of half-naked, tattooed sailors firing cannons at each other shivers your timbers, climb aboard. Even passable pirate movies don't sail by every day,\\" awarding the film a 2.5 star rating out of 4. Harlin was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director for his work on the film, but lost to Paul Verhoeven for Showgirls. Aftermath and legacy In a radio interview in 2011, Harlin discussed the film's box office failure. He pointed out that Carolco was already in ruin before shooting even began, but had to make the film since financing from foreign investors was already in place. MGM, the film's distributor, was in the process of being sold and thus could not devote itself into financing a marketing campaign for the film.The Business. \\"Action Director Renny Harlin\\" (radio interview). KCRW, Santa Monica, California. Retrieved October 17, 2011. Carolco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a month before Cutthroat Islands release. The failure of Cutthroat Island is also credited with significantly reducing the bankability and Hollywood production of pirate-themed films, which recovered only with the production of Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003. Video game A video game was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released for the major platforms of the time (such as the Super NES, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy) to tie in with the film. It loosely follows the events of the film.

Sebastian Kr√ºger was born in Hamelin in 1963. After studying free painting with Prof. D√∂rfler at the Braunschweig University of Fine Arts he made a stunning reputation as the designer of a number of cover spreads for the press in Germany and abroad and as an illustrator and creative designer of various LP covers. He then stepped away from commercial work and devoted himself solely to free painting. Artistically he has developed, in recent years, away from the early role of the so-called \\"star caricaturist\\" to that of a star of the New Pop Realism. His artistic visions are treasured and collected by other stars of the pop scene, like the Rolling Stones, who are friends of his, and by art connoisseurs all over the world. In the quarter century of his creative career Kr√ºger has remained true to the ideal of a New Pop Art, dedicating his art to a kind of game of deception, the interplay of identity and pose, of authenticity and fiction. This has enabled him to establish himself as a popular painter whose works draw large numbers of visitors to the galleries and museums. The defining feature of his work is creative reflection about the apparatus of media presentation and the manic iconography of contemporary picture production. His FACES are a kindly meant but thoroughly subversive tribute to the world of beautiful appearances and to the rock and pop culture of the sixties, with which the painter has cultivated an almost ritualistic relationship. According to his own comment on his work ( \\"Everything is in transition, that's all\\") he has devoted himself for some years, with the same artistic passion as before, to the reworking of the private world of his childhood. The artist lives and works near Hanover and in California. His primary medium is acrylic paint, and his paintings are hyper-realistic in detail, yet also extremely grotesque in their distortion. The Times praised him for \\"capturing the essence of his subjects\\" in his renderings. He is well known for his lifelike depictions of The Rolling Stones, in particular, Keith Richards.

These models are often graphs, groups or lattices. Closely related to pitch class space is pitch space, which represents pitches rather than pitch classes, and chordal space, which models relationships between chords. Circular pitch class space Circular pitch class space The simplest pitch space model is the real line. In the MIDI Tuning Standard, for example, fundamental frequencies f are mapped to numbers p according to the equation : p = 69 + 12\\\\log_2 {(f/440)} This creates a linear space in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69 (meaning middle C is assigned the number 60). To create circular pitch class space we identify or \\"glue together\\" pitches p and p + 12. The result is a continuous, circular pitch class space that mathematicians call Z/12Z.  Circles of generators  Other models of pitch class space, such as the circle of fifths, attempt to describe the special relationship between pitch classes related by perfect fifth. In equal temperament, twelve successive fifths equate to seven octaves exactly, and hence in terms of pitch classes closes back to itself, forming a circle. We say that the pitch class of the fifth generates ‚Äì or is a generator of ‚Äì the space of twelve pitch classes. By dividing the octave into n equal parts, and choosing an integer m\\\\mathbb{Z}_{12} with generators r and s). The result is a graph of genus one, which is to say, a graph with a donut or torus shape. Such a graph is called a toroidal graph. An example is equal temperament; twelve is the product of 3 and 4, and we may represent any pitch class as a combination of thirds of an octave, or major thirds, and fourths of an octave, or minor thirds, and then draw a toroidal graph by drawing an edge whenever two pitch classes differ by a major or minor third. We may generalize immediately to any number of relatively prime factors, producing graphs can be drawn in a regular manner on an n-torus.  Chains of generators  A linear temperament is a regular temperament of rank two generated by the octave and another interval, commonly called \\"the\\" generator. The most familiar example by far is meantone temperament, whose generator is a flattened, meantone fifth. The pitch classes of any linear temperament can be represented as lying along an infinite chain of generators; in meantone for instance this would be -F-C-G-D-A- etc. This defines a linear modulatory space.  Cylindrical modulatory spaces  A temperament of rank two which is not linear has one generator which is a fraction of an octave, called the period. We may represent the modulatory space of such a temperament as n chains of generators in a circle, forming a cylinder. Here n is the number of periods in an octave. For example, diaschismic temperament is the temperament which tempers out the diaschisma, or 2048/2025. It can be represented as two chains of slightly (3.25 to 3.55 cents) sharp fifths a half-octave apart, which can be depicted as two chains perpendicular to a circle and at opposite side of it. The cylindrical appearance of this sort of modulatory space becomes more apparent when the period is a smaller fraction of an octave; for example, ennealimmal temperament has a modulatory space consisting of nine chains of minor thirds in a circle (where the thirds may be only 0.02 to 0.03 cents sharp.)  Five- limit modulatory space  Five limit just intonation has a modulatory space based on the fact that its pitch classes can be represented by 3a 5b, where a and b are integers. It is therefore a free abelian group with the two generators 3 and 5, and can be represented in terms of a square lattice with fifths along the horizontal axis, and major thirds along the vertical axis. In many ways a more enlightening picture emerges if we represent it in terms of a hexagonal lattice instead; this is the Tonnetz of Hugo Riemann, discovered independently around the same time by Shoh√© Tanaka. The fifths are along the horizontal axis, and the major thirds point off to the right at an angle of sixty degrees. Another sixty degrees gives us the axis of major sixths, pointing off to the left. The non-unison elements of the 5-limit tonality diamond, 3/2, 5/4, 5/3, 4/3, 8/5, 6/5 are now arranged in a regular hexagon around 1. The triads are the equilateral triangles of this lattice, with the upwards-pointing triangles being major triads, and downward-pointing triangles being minor triads. This picture of five-limit modulatory space is generally preferable since it treats the consonances in a uniform way, and does not suggest that, for instance, a major third is more of a consonance than a major sixth. When two lattice points are as close as possible, a unit distance apart, then and only then are they separated by a consonant interval. Hence the hexagonal lattice provides a superior picture of the structure of the five-limit modulatory space. In more abstract mathematical terms, we can describe this lattice as the integer pairs (a, b), where instead of the usual Euclidean distance we have a Euclidean distance defined in terms of the vector space norm :(a, b) = \\\\sqrt{a^2 + ab + b^2}.  Seven-limit modulatory space  In similar fashion, we can define a modulatory space for seven-limit just intonation, by representing 3a 5b 7c in terms of a corresponding cubic lattice. Once again, however, a more enlightening picture emerges if we represent it instead in terms of the three-dimensional analog of the hexagonal lattice, a lattice called A3, which is equivalent to the face centered cubic lattice, or D3. Abstractly, it can be defined as the integer triples (a, b, c), associated to 3a 5b 7c, where the distance measure is not the usual Euclidean distance but rather the Euclidean distance deriving from the vector space norm :(a, b, c) = \\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + ab + bc + ca}. In this picture, the twelve non-unison elements of the seven-limit tonality diamond are arranged around 1 in the shape of a cuboctahedron.

Based on the medieval La Damigella di Scalot, it tells the tragic story of Elaine of Astolat, a young noblewoman imprisoned in a tower up the river from Camelot. One of the poet's best-known works, its vivid medieval romanticism and enigmatic symbolism inspired many painters, especially the Pre-Raphaelites and their followers. Like his other early poems ‚Äì \\"Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere\\" and \\"Galahad\\" ‚Äì the poem recasts Arthurian subject matter loosely based on medieval sources. Tennyson wrote two versions of the poem, one published in 1833, of 20 stanzas, the other in 1842, of 19 stanzas. The revised version has a significantly different ending. This revision was designed to match Victorian morals regarding gender norms and the act of suicide. Origin The poem is loosely based on the Arthurian legend of Elaine of Astolat, as recounted in a 13th-century Italian novellina titled La Damigella di Scalot (No. LXXXII in the collection Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike)Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike; the earlier version is closer to the source material than the latter. Tennyson focused on the Lady's \\"isolation in the tower and her decision to participate in the living world, two subjects not even mentioned in Donna di Scalotta.\\" Poem The first four stanzas of the 1842 poem describe a pastoral setting. The Lady of Shalott lives in an island castle in a river which flows to Camelot, but the local farmers know little about her. Stanzas five to eight describe the lady's life. She suffers from a mysterious curse and must continually weave images on her loom without ever looking directly out at the world. Instead, she looks into a mirror, which reflects the busy road and the people of Camelot who pass by her island. The reflected images are described as \\"shadows of the world\\", a metaphor that makes it clear they are a poor substitute for seeing directly (\\"I am half-sick of shadows\\"). The Lady of Shalott by William Maw Egley (1858) Stanzas nine to twelve describe \\"bold Sir Lancelot\\" as he rides by and is seen by the lady. The remaining seven stanzas describe the effect on the lady of seeing Lancelot; she stops weaving and looks out of her window toward Camelot, bringing about the curse. She leaves her tower, finds a boat upon which she writes her name, and floats down the river to Camelot. She dies before arriving at the palace. Among the knights and ladies who see her is Lancelot, who thinks she is lovely. Themes According to scholar Anne Zanzucchi, \\"in a more general sense, it is fair to say that the pre-Raphaelite fascination with Arthuriana is traceable to Tennyson's work\\". Tennyson's biographer Leon√©e Ormonde finds the Arthurian material is \\"Introduced as a valid setting for the study of the artist and the dangers of personal isolation\\". Feminist critics see the poem as concerned with issues of women's sexuality and their place in the Victorian world. Critics argue that \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" centres on the temptation of sexuality and her innocence preserved by death. Christine Poulson discusses a feminist viewpoint and suggests: \\"the Lady of Shalott's escape from her tower as an act of defiance, a symbol of female empowerment.\\" Based on Poulson's view, escaping from the tower allows for the Lady of Shalott to emotionally break free and come into terms with female sexuality. The Lady of Shalott by Walter Crane (1862) The depiction of death has also been interpreted as sleep. Poulson says that sleep has a connotation of physical abandonment and vulnerability, which can either suggest sexual fulfillment or be a metaphor for virginity. Fairy tales, such as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, have traditionally depended upon this association. So, as related to the Lady of Shalott, Poulson says: \\"for in death [she] has become a Sleeping Beauty who can never be wakened, symbols of perfect feminine passivity.\\" Critics such as Hatfield have suggested that \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" is a representation of how Tennyson viewed society; the distance at which other people are in the lady's eyes is symbolic of the distance he feels from society. The fact that she sees them only reflected through a mirror signifies the way in which Shalott and Tennyson see the world‚Äîin a filtered sense. This distance is therefore linked to the artistic licence Tennyson often wrote about. Cultural influence Art Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of \\"Immortals\\", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including Keats and Tennyson. \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" was particularly popular with the Brotherhood, which shared Tennyson's interest in Arthuriana; several of the Brotherhood made paintings based on episodes from the poem. Two aspects, in particular, of \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" intrigued these artists: the idea of the lady trapped in her tower and the dying girl floating down the river towards Camelot. William Holman Hunt's The Lady of Shalott, c. 1888-1905 In Edward Moxon's 1857 edition of Tennyson's works, illustrated by Hunt and Rossetti, Hunt depicted the moment when the Lady turns to see Lancelot. In the background of the illustration, Hunt juxtaposes the window facing Lancelot with a painting of Christ's crucifixion. According to Christine Poulson, the Crucifixion is the archetype of self-sacrifice and further emphasises the ideal that the Lady of Shalott fails to represent. Poulson also considers this representation of the subject in the context of changing women's roles in the 1880s and 1890s, suggesting that it served as a warning of imminent death to women who stepped from their restricted roles and explored their desires. Rossetti depicted Lancelot's contemplation of the Lady's \\"lovely face\\". Neither illustration pleased Tennyson, who took Hunt to task for depicting the Lady caught in the threads of her tapestry, something which is not described in the poem. Hunt explained that he wanted to sum up the whole poem in a single image, and that the entrapment by the threads suggested her \\"weird fate\\". The scene fascinated Hunt, who returned to the composition at points throughout his life and finally painted a large scale version shortly before his death. He required assistants, as he was too frail to complete it himself. This deeply conceived evocation of the Lady, ensnared within the perfect rounds of her woven reality, is an apt illustration of the mythology of the weaving arts. This work is now in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut. The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse, 1888 John William Waterhouse painted three episodes from the poem. In 1888, he painted the Lady setting out for Camelot in her boat; this work is now in the Tate Gallery. In 1894, Waterhouse painted the Lady at the climactic moment when she turns to look at Lancelot in the window in The Lady of Shalott Looking at Lancelot; this work is now in the City Art Gallery in Leeds. Poulson argues that Waterhouse's impressionistic painting style in his 1894 rendering of The Lady of Shalott evokes a \\"sense of vitality and urgency\\". In 1915, Waterhouse painted I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott, as she sits wistfully before her loom; this work is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario.

(one-shot) * In Chapter 25 of Elly Griffiths' novel The House at Sea's End (2010), Jack Hastings \\"says something to Nelson and Nelson laughs, the sound echoing up to Ruth's turret window. She retreats. She doesn't want them seeing her there, like some overweight Lady of Shallot.\\" * Alan C. Bradley uses the line \\"I am half-sick of shadows\\" to title his book I Am Half-Sick of Shadows (2011). * In Jasper Fforde's novel One of our Thursdays Is Missing (2011), the Lady of Shalott possesses a mirror that allows characters in the Book World to see into the real world (\\"the Outland\\"). * Sarah Gridley's poetry collection Loom (2013) is heavily influenced by The Lady of Shalott. Music * The first musical setting of the poem was probably a work for mezzo-soprano soloist, chorus and orchestra by the English composer Cyril Rootham, composed in 1909‚Äì10. The only known performance of Rootham's op 33 The Lady of Shalott was given in the School Hall at Eton College on 18 September 1999, with the Broadheath Singers and the Windsor Sinfonia conducted by Robert Tucker. * French composer Olivier Messiaen wrote a piece for solo piano La dame de Shalotte in 1917 based on Tennyson's poem. * In 1946 Phyllis Tate composed a setting of Tennyson's The Lady of Shalott, written for the 10th anniversary of the BBC Third Programme. * In 1957-58 Arthur Bliss (once a pupil of Cyril Rootham, above) composed a 40-minute ballet suite titled The Lady of Shalott. * Popular folk duo the Indigo Girls refer to the Lady of Shalott in the song \\"Left Me a Fool\\" (first released on their 1987 album Strange Fire). Lamenting the lack of depth and substance she finds when getting to know a beautiful lover, the singer sings \\"you remind me of Shalott, only made of shadows, even though you're not.\\" * Canadian singer Loreena McKennitt adapted the poem to music, and featured it on her 1991 album The Visit. * British musician and singer, Richard Thompson, took the title for his 1994 album Mirror Blue from the poem: 'And sometimes thro' the mirror blue/ The knights come riding two and two.' * Composer Jon Parr Vijinski wrote a symphonic tone poem entitled The Lady of Shalott (2001).

After allying with the Sufri Kharijite rebellion in Morocco against the Umayyad Caliphate, they established an independent state (744-1058) in the area of Tamesna on the Atlantic coast between Safi and Sal√© under the leadership of Tarif al-Matghari. Etymology Some historians believe that the term Barghawata is a phonetic deformation of the term Barbati, a nickname which Tarif carried. It is thought that he was born in the area of Barbate, near C√°diz in Spain.Tarif, el conquistador de Tarifa by Enrique Gozalbes Cravioto - However, J√©r√¥me Carcopino and other historians think the name is much older and the tribe is the same as that which the Romans called Baquates, who up until the 7th century lived near Volubilis.see e.g. this article originally published in Hesperis and for a contrary view the reference by Mohammed Talbi cited above History Western Eurasia and North Africa , showing the Barghawata in central Morocco Few details are known about Barghawata. Most of the historical sources are largely posterior to their rule and often present a contradictory and confused historical context. However, one tradition appears more interesting. It comes from C√≥rdoba in Spain and its author is the Large Prior of Barghawata and the Barghawata ambassador to C√≥rdoba Abu Salih Zammur, around the middle of the 10th century. This tradition is regarded as most detailed concerning Barghwata.Talbi (ref. cited above) believes, however, that it contains a certain amount of myth or propaganda It was reported by Al Bakri, Ibn Hazm and Ibn Khaldun, although their interpretations comprise some divergent points of view. The Barghawatas, along with the Ghomara and the Miknasa, launched the Berber Revolt of 739 or 740. They were fired up by Sufri Kharijite preachers, a Muslim sect that embraced a doctrine representing total egalitarianism in opposition to the aristocracy of the Quraysh which had grown more pronounced under the Umayyad Caliphate. The rebels elected Maysara al-Matghari to lead their revolt, and successfully seized control of nearly all of what is now Morocco, inspiring further rebellions in the Maghreb and al-Andalus. At the Battle of Bagdoura, the rebels annihilated a particularly strong army dispatched by the Umayyad caliph from Syria. But the rebels army itself was eventually defeated in the outskirts Kairouan, Ifriqiya in 741. In the aftermath, the rebel alliance dissolved. Even before this denouement, the Barghawatas, as founders of the revolt, had grown resentful of the attempt by later adherents, notably the Zenata chieftains, in alliance with the increasingly authoritarian Sufri commissars, to take control of the leadership of the rebellion. As their primary objective ‚Äì the liberation of their people from Umayyad rule ‚Äì had already been achieved, and there was little prospect of it ever being re- imposed, the Barghwata saw little point in continued military campaigns. In 742 or 743, the Barghwata removed themselves from the rebel alliance, and retreated to the Tamesna region, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, where they founded their new independent state and abandoned their Sufri Kharijitism. The Barghawatas ruled in the Tamesna region for more than three centuries (744‚Äì1058). Under the successors of Salih ibn Tarif, Ilyas ibn Salih (792-842); Yunus (842-888) and Abu Ghufail (888‚Äì913) the tribal kingdom was consolidated, and missions sent to neighbouring tribes. After initially good relations with the Caliphate of Cordoba there was a break at the end of the 10th century with the ruling Umayyads. Two Umayyad incursions, as well as attacks by the Fatimids were fought off by the Barghawata. From the 11th century there was an intensive guerrilla war with the Banu Ifran. Even though the Barghawata were subsequently much weakened,Al Bakri even states they were annihilated in 1029, although this is inconsistent with what he himself states elsewhere regarding their battles with the Almoravids they were still able to fend off Almoravid attacks‚Äîthe spiritual leader of the Almoravids, Abdallah ibn Yasin, fell in battle against them on 7 July 1058. Only in 1149 were the Barghawata eliminated by the Almohads as a political and religious group. Religion After the conversion to Islam at the beginning of the 8th century and the Maysara uprising (739-742), the Barghawata Berbers formed their own state on the Atlantic coast between Safi and Sal√©. The Barghawata kingdom followed a syncretic religion inspired by Islam with elements of Sunni, Shi'a and Kharijite Islam, mixed with astrological and traditional Berber mythology such as their taboo surrounding eating eggs and chickens, and the belief that the saliva of Salih and his family contained baraka, or, roughly translated, blessedness. Supposedly, they had their own Qur'an in the Berber language comprising 80 suras under the leadership of the second ruler of the dynasty Salih ibn Tarif who had taken part in the Maysara uprising. He proclaimed himself a prophet.Talbi (ref. cited above) notes that in fact there is no contemporary record of him being anything other than a Sufri Kharijite, and that it may have been a myth propagated by Yunus He also claimed to be the final Mahdi, and that Isa (Jesus) would be his companion and pray behind him.  Tribes  The Barghawata confederacy was made of 29 tribes. 12 of these tribes adopted the Barghawata religion while 17 retained Islam.

Along the way, it intersects several major routes, including Interstate 88 (I-88), U.S. Route 20 (US 20), and the New York State Thruway twice. The southern terminus of NY 28 is at NY 32 in Kingston and the northern terminus is at US 9 in Warrensburg. In Kingston, NY 28 is co-designated as Interstate 587 from its southern terminus at NY 32 to the roundabout linking it to the Thruway (I-87). NY 28 was originally assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville in the south to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY 28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY 28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY 28 has remained the same to this day. Route description Ulster County NY 28's southern terminus is with NY 32 (Albany Avenue) in the city of Kingston. The route heads north, then northwest on Colonel Chandler Drive, a four-lane limited-access highway. The roadway is also designated and signed as I-587, which begins at NY 32 as well. Although Colonel Chandler Drive is built to Interstate Highway standards, it has no intermediary interchanges. After crossing over the Esopus Creek into Ulster, I-587 terminates at a roundabout that links I-587 and NY 28 to the New York State Thruway (I-87) at exit 19. West of I-87, the route crosses the Blue Line of Catskill Park and becomes the Onteora Trail. Although still four lanes wide, the route is no longer a limited-access highway as it has an at-grade intersection with Modica Lane, a local dead-end street, just west of where it passes over the Thruway. Not long afterward, the highway meets US 209 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. Past US 209, the highway enters a rural area as it heads northwest into the center of the state park. Near the eastern tip of the Ashokan Reservoir, in the town of Kingston, NY 28 intersects the eastern terminus of NY 28A. West of NY 28A, NY 28 continues towards the north and west along the northern edge of the reservoir. In West Hurley, the route intersects the southern terminus of NY 375\\\\. It proceeds along the reservoir to its western end in the town of Olive community of Boiceville, where NY 28A reconnects to the route. Here the mountains begin to loom over the road, with Mount Tremper dominating the view to the north as the route continues along Esopus Creek into the town of Shandaken after passing the southern terminus of NY 212 at Mount Pleasant. At Phoenicia, the largest settlement since Kingston, NY 214 reaches its southern terminus at the highway. Past Phoenicia, the surrounding slopes become steeper as the road and creek curve around Panther Mountain, one of the Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall on the south side of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY 42's northern segment. As NY 28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead. The northern terminus of NY 42's southern segment marks the small hamlet of Big Indian, after which Esopus Creek crosses for the last time, turning south to its source at Winnisook Lake. The road begins a sustained climb over the next two miles paralleling an Esopus tributary, Birch Creek, up to Pine Hill. At the road to Belleayre Ski Center, in Highmount, the last junction before it leaves the Catskill Park and enters Delaware County, it is for the first time signed as a north‚Äìsouth route. Delaware and Otsego counties alt=Two road signs with the number 28 in black on a white background with \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" written over them and arrows pointing in opposite directions underneath. On the left is a sign saying \\"Flesischmanns 1 mile\\" in black on a gold background with an arrow pointing to the left. Behind the signs are roads, woods and telephone wires Across the county line in Middletown, the highway shifts towards the west. NY 28 begins a concurrency with NY 30 in Margaretville, with the routes paralleling the East Branch of the Delaware River. After crossing the Delaware River, the route ends its concurrency with NY 30, and NY 28 continues northwest through Andes as Main Street and Delaware Avenue. In the village of Delhi, the highway becomes known as Andes Road and has a short concurrency with NY 10 in the village center. North of Delhi, it continues north towards the hamlet of Meredith, proceeding west past the hamlet. In Franklin, NY 28 makes a 90-degree turn to the north at the roundabout intersection with the eastern end of NY 357. Once in Otsego County, it traverses an s-curve before veering to the east to follow the southern bank of the Susquehanna River through the town of Oneonta. The route initially connects to the city of Oneonta, which is located across the river from NY 28, via Main Street. Shortly afterward, NY 28 meets NY 23\\\\. The route turns north, overlapping NY 23 along the four-lane James F. Lettis Highway. The two routes cross the River and enter the Oneonta city limits before separating at I-88 exit 15\\\\. NY 23 continues north on the arterial, while NY 28 joins I-88 eastward out of the city. Back in the town of Oneonta, the overlap between NY 28 and I-88 continues along the northern bank of the Susquehanna toward the hamlet of Emmons, where the expressway meets County Route 47 (CR 47) at exit 16\\\\. The overlap ends at exit 17 in Milford; however, NY 28 remains in close proximity to the Susquehanna River, which turns northward at the interchange. Roughly north of I-88, the highway passes over NY 7 with no access between the two. After another , the route meets D.K. Lifgren Drive (unsigned NY 992G), a connector providing access between Routes 7 and 28. North of Goodyear Lake, a body of water situated north of Lifgren Drive, the highway parallels the Susquehanna to the village of Milford, where it intersects the southern terminus of NY 166. The highway continues northward along the banks of the Susquehanna to the village of Cooperstown, home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Inside the village, the route is initially known as Chestnut Street. Two blocks from the business district of the village, it intersects NY 80, which occupies Chestnut Street north of this point. Both routes turn west, overlapping each other as the routes leave the village. The portion of the highway between the southern border of the village of Cooperstown and the northern intersection with Grove Street is maintained by the village, and is the only section of the route not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Routes 28 and 80 head towards the northwest, passing by the now-abandoned Cooperstown Airport. In Otsego, the NY 28/80 concurrency ends at the intersection of NY 205\\\\. NY 28 continues northward as it passes Canadarago Lake. In Richfield Springs, the highway has a concurrency with US 20 for . North of US 20, the highway exits Otsego County. Herkimer and Oneida counties alt=A view of the four-lane NY 5S as it approaches a traffic signal. NY 28 is accessed by turning left at the signal. In the background and distance are tree-covered mountains. In German Flatts, NY 28 becomes Columbia Street and intersects the northern terminus of NY 168\\\\. In Mohawk, NY 28 intersects NY 5S. After crossing the Mohawk River, NY 28 becomes Mohawk Street and meets I-90 (New York State Thruway) at exit 30\\\\. In the village of Herkimer, NY 28 has a concurrency with NY 5\\\\. North of NY 5, NY 28 begins to parallel the West Canada Creek. In Middleville, it intersects the western terminus of NY 29 and the northern terminus of NY 169\\\\. The highway executes a 90-degree turn at the three-route junction. NY 28 continues towards the north paralleling the West Canada Creek. In Poland, NY 28 begins a concurrency with NY 8. In Deerfield, Oneida County, NY 28 splits from NY 8\\\\. NY 28 crosses the West Canada Creek and leaves Oneida County for about , then re-crosses the creek and enters Oneida County again. In Trenton, NY 28 joins NY 12 northward toward Barneveld. In Barneveld, NY 12 and NY 28 intersect NY 365\\\\. NY 28 splits from NY 12 in Remsen and heads toward the northeast, passing through numerous lakes and reservoirs. In Forestport, it enters Adirondack Park as it parallels the Adirondack Mountains. NY 28 briefly reenters Herkimer County, but does not have any major junctions. NY 28 passes the Fulton Chain Lakes, among several other large lakes, as it winds through the Adirondack Park. Hamilton and Warren counties alt=A two-lane highway passes alongside several two-story homes, some of which house businesses. One side of the highway is lined with telephone poles that have streetlights and American flags mounted on them. The Fulton Chain Lakes which NY 28 has been following extend into Hamilton County. The highway soon reaches the settlement of Long Lake as it passes south of Raquette Lake. In the hamlet of Blue Mountain Lake, the route begins a wrong-way concurrency with NY 30; the concurrency ends in the hamlet of Indian Lake. East of NY 30, NY 28 begins to shift towards the south. NY 28 enters Warren County paralleling the Hudson River. In North Creek, it intersects the eastern terminus of NY 28N. The highway continues towards the south opposite to its original course. In Wevertown, it intersects NY 8\\\\. It continues towards the southeast paralleling the Hudson River and in Warrensburg, NY 28 comes to an end at a \\"Y\\" intersection with US 9. History Ulster and Delaware Turnpike In 1802, the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was chartered by the New York State Legislature \\"for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge)\\". The portion of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike east of the Hudson River was also commonly known as the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike or the Salisbury Turnpike. West of the river, the turnpike connected Kingston to modern-day Bainbridge. At that time it followed modern NY 28 west from Kingston up to the Delaware County hamlet of Andes. From Andes, the turnpike alignment left NY 28 to follow modern CR 2 to De Lancey, NY 10 to Walton, and NY 206 to the Village of Bainbridge. The turnpike crossed the river via the Kingston-Rhinecliff Ferry and used modern Rhinecliff Road and West Market Street to the village center of Rhinecliff, then roughly followed modern-day NY 308 to the hamlet of Eighmyville. It continued east from there using part of present-day CR 52 to eventually connect with and follow the route of current NY 199. The turnpike corporation operated through the late 19th century. Designation NY 28 was designated in 1924 by the New York State Department of Transportation from Colliersville (near Oneonta) north to Utica. At the time, NY 28 began at then-NY 9 in Colliersville and headed north on its current alignment to Cooperstown. NY 28 separated from its modern routing and continued to Springfield north of Cooperstown on what is now NY 80\\\\. Between Springfield and Richfield Springs, the highway utilized what is now US 20\\\\. At Richfield Springs, the highway turned north onto modern NY 167 and followed the current alignments of NY 167 and NY 168 to the village of Mohawk. Here, the highway turned westward, using a small portion of its current alignment and the present-day NY 5S corridor to connect to Utica by way of Ilion. In 1924, what is now NY 28 was part of NY 19 from Kingston to Margaretville (where NY 19 turned north to follow modern NY 30 to Grand Gorge), NY 9 from Oneonta to Colliersville, NY 28 from Colliersville to Cooperstown, NY 2 from Trenton to Forestport, and NY 10 from North Creek to Wevertown. The remaining portions of modern NY 28 were unnumbered. By 1926, the portion of current NY 28 from Margaretville to Meredith was designated as part of NY 64\\\\. Past Meredith, NY 64 continued north to NY 23 on Palmerville Road, McDougal Road, Rathbun Road, and Prosser Hollow Road. Additionally, the segment of modern NY 28 from Middleville to Trenton was designated as part of NY 29. Between 1926 and 1930, what is now NY 28 between Blue Mountain Lake and North Creek became part of NY 10A, a highway extending from Long Lake to North Creek via Blue Mountain Lake. Yellow Book map of Kingston loosely depicting what became I-587 (NY 28)alt=A shaded area roughly depicts the city of Kingston. A solid line passes the city to the left; one end of the line reads \\"to New York City\\" while the other (at top) reads \\"to Albany\\". Another solid line leads from that line to the center of Kingston, where it ends. In the 1930 renumbering, NY 28 was extended south from Colliersville to Kingston largely by way of its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to follow its modern routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The small portion of NY 10A that did not become part of NY 28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY 10. Realignments In Oneida County, NY 28 originally broke from its modern alignment southeast of Barneveld to follow modern CR 56 into the village. At Mappa Avenue, then carrying NY 12, NY 28 turned north, overlapping NY 12 north along Mappa Avenue through the village. Outside of Barneveld, NY 12 and NY 28 were routed on Plank Road and what is now CR 82 before rejoining their modern alignment near the Remsen community of East Steuben. NY 28 was rerouted slightly to enter Barneveld via an extension of Trenton Falls Road and Mappa Avenue. Both NY 12 and NY 28 were realigned onto a new four-lane roadway from Barneveld to East Steuben in the 1950s. Within Kingston, NY 28 initially began at the intersection of Broadway and East Chester Street, which was part of US 9W at the time. From there, NY 28 followed Broadway, Albany and Clinton avenues, North Front Street, and Washington Avenue through the city to Ulster, where it joined its modern routing at what is now the roundabout leading to New York State Thruway exit 19. When the initial plans for the Interstate Highway System were outlined by the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1955 Yellow Book, a highway was planned for the NY 28 corridor. This highway was included as part of the expansion to the system in 1957. Construction began on the roadway, which became Colonel Chandler Drive, in December 1958. It was designated as I-587 and became part of a rerouted NY 28 upon its completion in July 1960. NY 28 continued to extend eastward from Colonel Chandler Drive along Broadway to US 9W until its truncation to NY 32 in the early 1980s. Washington Avenue, bypassed by the new limited-access highway, is now designated as NY 981K, an unsigned reference route in length, from Hurley Avenue to NY 28. In the vicinity of Oneonta, NY 28 originally crossed the Susquehanna River by way of Main Street. The route followed Main Street through the city to Colliersville, where it turned north onto D.K. Lifgren Drive to rejoin its modern alignment. From downtown Oneonta to Colliersville, NY 28 overlapped NY 7\\\\. NY 28 was rerouted to follow its current alignment between Main Street south of Oneonta and D.K. Lifgren Drive near Colliersville in the early 1980s following the completion of what is now NY 28 from I-88 exit 17 to D.K. Lifgren Drive. The portion of Main Street between NY 28 and NY 7 ( long) is now designated as NY 992D while D.K. Lifgren Drive ( in length) is now NY 992G. Memorial designation alt=Four signs are mounted on a pole. From top to bottom, they are: the word \\"east\\", a NY 28N shield, a yellow-on-brown sign with an outline of Theodore Roosevelt's face and the text \\"Roosevelt-Marcy Trail\\", and a reference marker for NY 28N. On June 14, 2004, Governor George E. Pataki announced that a portion of the highway in the Town of Hurley in Ulster County was to be designated as the \\"New York State Troopers T. Michael Kelly and Kenneth A. Poorman Memorial Highway\\". During May 2000, troopers Kelly and Poorman were killed on this stretch of NY 28, when their police cruiser was struck by a tractor-trailer.

In legal context \\"prejudice\\" differs from the more common use of the word and thus has specific technical meanings. Two of the more common applications of the word are as part of the terms \\"with prejudice\\" and \\"without prejudice\\". In general, an action taken with prejudice is final. For example, \\"dismissal with prejudice\\" forbids a party to refile the case, and might occur either because of misconduct on the part of the party who filed the claim or criminal complaint, or the result of an out of court agreement or settlement. Dismissal \\"without prejudice\\" (in Latin, salvis iuribus) allows the party the option to refile, and is often a response to procedural or technical problems with the filing that the party could correct when filing again. With prejudice and without prejudice Criminal law Depending on the country, a criminal proceeding which ends prematurely due to error, mistake, or misconduct may end as being dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice. If the case ends without prejudice, the accused in the case (the defendant) may be retried. If the case ends with prejudice, the effect on the defendant (for the purpose of punishment) is the equivalent to a finding of not guilty and they cannot be retried. Some countries, however, allow the prosecution to appeal any acquittal. =United States= In the United States, if there is a mistrial, or the case is overturned on appeal, generally this is without prejudice and (in the case of decision overturned on appeal) either all of the case is retried, or, if not all of the case is overturned, the parts that were overturned, such as a sentencing hearing, are retried. If the case is dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, it will typically be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the defendant cannot be retried. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits that \\"any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\\". Outside of mistrial or appeal, the rule for whether or not a case is dismissed with or without prejudice thus depends on what condition the case is in and whether \\"jeopardy\\" has attached to the case. If jeopardy is attached to a case, a dismissal or a resolution is \\"with prejudice\\" and the case can never be litigated again. In the case of a trial by jury, jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled, and a dismissal (for prosecutorial misconduct or harmful error) at that point must be with prejudice. In the case of a bench trial (trial by the judge only), jeopardy attaches when the first witness in the case is sworn. If a criminal case is brought to trial and the defendant is acquitted, jeopardy is attached to the case and it can never be retried. If the defendant was convicted and his conviction is overturned, jeopardy is not attached because the defendant is considered to simply be in the same state they were before the case was tried. If a person is brought to trial where they are charged with a particular crime and is convicted of a lesser offense, the conviction for a lesser offense is an acquittal of any higher-level offense (for example, a conviction for second-degree murder is an acquittal of first-degree murder). If the conviction is later overturned, the maximum the defendant can be retried for is the crime to which they were convicted; any higher charge is acquitted and thus is with prejudice. Civil law Within legal civil procedure, prejudice is a loss or injury, and refers specifically to a formal determination against a claimed legal right or cause of action. Thus, in a civil case, dismissal without prejudice is a dismissal that allows for re- filing of the case in the future. The present action is dismissed but the possibility remains open that the plaintiff may file another suit on the same claim. The inverse phrase is dismissal with prejudice, in which the plaintiff is barred from filing another case on the same claim. Dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment and the case becomes res judicata on the claims that were or could have been brought in it; dismissal without prejudice is not. Common law In many common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, the phrase has several usages. =Dismissal= A civil matter which is \\"dismissed with prejudice\\" is over forever. This is a final judgement, not subject to further action, which bars the plaintiff from bringing any other lawsuit based on the claim. If it is an involuntary dismissal, the judge has determined that the plaintiff has brought the case in bad faith, has failed to bring the case in a reasonable time, has failed to comply with court procedures, or on the merits after hearing the arguments in court. The dismissal itself may be appealed. If it is a \\"voluntary dismissal with prejudice\\", it is the result of an out of court agreement or settlement between parties that they agree is final. If the case is dismissed \\"without prejudice\\" the lawsuit can be filed again by the plaintiff. Typically before a defendant has answered the suit, or made a motion in the case, a plaintiff may file for \\"dismissal without prejudice\\" more easily and may do so for tactical reasons such as filing in a different jurisdiction. As well it is common for plaintiffs to be limited, after filing a voluntary motion to dismiss, to only one additional filing of the suit, after which they may be barred from filing again. =Settlement negotiations= The term \\"without prejudice\\" is used in the course of negotiations to settle a lawsuit. It indicates that a particular conversation or letter cannot be tendered as evidence in court. It can be considered a form of privilege. This usage flows from the primary meaning: concessions and representations made for purpose of settlement are simply being mooted for that purpose, and are not meant to actually concede those points in litigation. Such correspondences must both be made in the course of negotiations and a genuine attempt to settle a dispute between the parties. A prohibition exists on documents marked \\"without prejudice\\" being used as a fa√ßade to conceal facts or evidence from the court. As a result, documents marked \\"without prejudice\\" that do not actually contain any offer of settlement may be used as evidence, should the matter proceed to court. Courts may also decide to exclude from evidence communications not marked \\"without prejudice\\" that do contain offers of settlement. The term \\"without prejudice save as to costs\\" is a change to the above and refers to a communication that cannot be exhibited in court until the end of the trial, when the court awards legal costs to the successful party unless some other order is made because an offer was unreasonably rejected. This is also called the Calderbank formula, from Calderbank v Calderbank (2 All E.R. 333 (1976)), and exists because English courts have held that \\"without prejudice\\" includes for the purposes of costs, as in Court of Appeal, in Walker v. Wilshire (23 QBD 335 (1889)): > Letters or conversations written or declared to be \\"without prejudice\\" > cannot be taken into consideration in determining whether there is a good > cause for depriving a successful litigant of costs. Prejudicial actions An action (such as an error made by the court) is prejudicial if it substantially affects a litigant's legal rights. Thus, a harmless error would not be prejudicial, while plain error is sometimes defined as a highly prejudicial error. An error that is determined to not have been prejudicial will typically not be considered a reversible error. A court may sometimes explicitly reassure a litigant that an action will not prejudice him. For example, if a defendant left an important document at home that he needed for the court hearing, the court may assure him that continuing the proceedings to a future date will not prejudice him in any way‚Äîthat is, that it will not affect the court's judgment in a way that disfavors him. Or a court may assure a litigant that agreeing to a temporary arrangement, e.g. concerning custody of an asset whose ownership is disputed, will not prejudice his rights with regard to the eventual judgment of the court in the case. In other words, the litigant will not be waiving any rights other than those he's specifically agreeing to temporarily waive. In English criminal law, from the moment a suspect is charged until judgement is given, it is not permitted to report on matters that may be given in evidence or that might otherwise influence the jury before this evidence is presented. Unless the court directs otherwise, media may report the evidence given in court but may not speculate on its significance. These restrictions are normally removed after judgement is given, unless to do so might prejudice another prosecution in progress.

Led by Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, these women, dubbed the \\"Petticoats,\\" socially ostracized then‚ÄìSecretary of War John Eaton and his wife Peggy Eaton, over disapproval of the circumstances surrounding the Eatons‚Äô marriage; what they deemed as her failure to meet the \\"moral standards of a Cabinet Wife\\". The Petticoat Affair rattled the entire Jackson Administration, and eventually led to the resignation of all but one Cabinet member. The ordeal facilitated Martin Van Buren's rise to the presidency, and was in part responsible for Vice President Calhoun's transformation from a nationwide political figure with Presidential aspirations into a sectional leader of the Southern states. Background Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Eaton was the eldest daughter of William O'Neill, owner of the Franklin House, a boarding house and tavern located in Washington, D.C. a short distance from the White House that was a well-known social hub popular with politicians and military officials. Peggy was well- educated for a woman of that era ‚Äì she studied French and was known for her ability to play the piano.\\"Andrew Jackson: The Petticoat Affair, Scandal in Jackson's White House\\", History Net, accessed August 4, 2009. William T. Barry, who later served as Postmaster General, wrote \\"of a charming little girl ... who very frequently plays the piano, and entertains us with agreeable songs.\\" As a young girl, her reputation had already begun to come under scrutiny, due to being employed in a bar frequented by men as well as her casual bantering with the boarding house's clientele. In her elder years, Peggy reminisced, \\"While I was still in pantalettes and rolling hoops with other girls, I had the attention of men, young and old; enough to turn a girl's head.\\" When Peggy was 15 years old, her father intervened to prevent her attempt to elope with an Army officer. In 1816, the now-17-year old Peggy married John B. Timberlake (1777‚Äì1828), a purser in the United States Navy. Timberlake, aged 39, had a reputation as a drunkard and was heavily in debt. The Timberlakes became acquainted with John Eaton in 1818. At the time, Eaton was a wealthy 28-year-old widower and newly elected U.S. Senator from Tennessee, despite not yet having reached the constitutionally-mandated minimum age of 30. He was also a long-time friend of Andrew Jackson. Once Timberlake told Eaton of his financial troubles, Eaton unsuccessfully attempted to have the Senate pass legislation that would authorize payment of the debts Timberlake had accrued during his Naval service. Eventually, Eaton paid Timberlake's debts, and procured him a lucrative posting to the U.S. Navy's Mediterranean Squadron; many rumormongers asserted that Eaton aided Timberlake as a means to remove him from Washington, in order for Eaton to socialize with Peggy. While with the Mediterranean Squadron, Timberlake died on April 2, 1828. This served to fuel new rumors throughout Washington, suggesting he had taken his own life, as the result of Eaton's supposed affair with Peggy. Medical examiners concluded Timberlake had died of pneumonia, brought on by pulmonary disease. Controversy Jackson was elected president in 1828, with his term set to begin on March 4, 1829. He was reportedly fond of Peggy Timberlake and encouraged Eaton to marry her. They were wed on January 1, 1829; only nine months after her husband's death. Customarily, it would have been considered \\"proper\\" for their marriage to have followed a longer mourning period. Historian John F. Marszalek explained his opinion on the \\"real reasons Washington society found Peggy unacceptable\\": > She did not know her place; she forthrightly spoke up about anything that > came to her mind, even topics of which women were supposed to be ignorant. > She thrust herself into the world in a manner inappropriate for a woman. ... > Accept her, and society was in danger of disruption. Accept this uncouth, > impure, forward, worldly woman, and the wall of virtue and morality would be > breached and society would have no further defenses against the forces of > frightening change. Margaret Eaton was not that important in herself; it was > what she represented that constituted the threat. Proper women had no > choice; they had to prevent her acceptance into society as part of their > defense of that society's morality. Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John Calhoun and leader of the \\"anti- Peggy\\" Washington wives When Jackson assumed the presidency, he appointed Eaton as Secretary of War. Floride Calhoun, Second Lady of the United States, led the wives of other Washington political figures, mostly those of Jackson's cabinet members in an \\"anti-Peggy\\" coalition, which served to shun the Eatons socially and publicly. The women refused to pay courtesy calls to the Eatons at their home and to receive them as visitors, and denied them invitations to parties and other social events. President Andrew Jackson supported the Eatons in the Petticoat affair. Emily Donelson, niece of Andrew Jackson's late wife Rachel Donelson Robards, and the wife of Jackson's adopted son and confidant Andrew Jackson Donelson, served as Jackson's \\"surrogate First Lady\\".Chronology of the U.S. Presidency, p. 245. Emily Donelson chose to side with the Calhoun faction, thus leading to Jackson replacing her with his daughter-in-law Sarah Yorke Jackson, as his official hostess.Ranking the First Ladies Secretary of State Martin Van Buren was a widower, and the only unmarried member of the Cabinet; he raised himself in Jackson's esteem by aligning himself with the Eatons. Jackson's sympathy for the Eatons stemmed in part from his late wife Rachel being the subject of innuendo during the presidential campaign, when questions arose as to whether her first marriage had been legally ended before she married Jackson. Jackson believed these attacks were the cause of Rachel's death on December 22, 1828, several weeks after his election to the presidency. Eaton's entry into a high-profile cabinet post helped intensify the opposition of Mrs. Calhoun's group. In addition, Calhoun was becoming the focal point of opposition to Jackson; Calhoun's supporters opposed a second term for Jackson because they wanted Calhoun elected president. In addition, Jackson favored and Calhoun opposed the protective tariff that came to be known as the Tariff of Abominations. U.S. tariffs on imported goods generally favored northern industries by limiting competition, but southerners opposed them because the tariffs raised the price of finished goods, but not the raw materials produced in the south. The dispute over the tariff led to the Nullification Crisis of 1832, with southerners - including Calhoun - arguing that states could refuse to obey federal laws to which they objected, even to the point of secession from the Union, while Jackson vowed to prevent secession and preserve the Union at any cost. Because Calhoun was the most visible opponent of the Jackson administration, Jackson felt that Calhoun and other anti-Jackson officials were fanning the flames of the Peggy Eaton controversy in an attempt to gain political leverage. Duff Green, a Calhoun prot√©g√© and editor of the United States Telegraph, accused Eaton of secretly working to have pro-Calhoun cabinet members Samuel D. Ingham (Treasury) and John Branch (Navy) removed from their positions. Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged which accurately stated that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These reports infuriated Jackson. Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the Telegraph. Their publication gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy, which further enraged the President. Resolution The dispute was finally resolved when Van Buren offered to resign, giving Jackson the opportunity to reorganize his cabinet by asking for the resignations of the anti-Eaton cabinet members. Postmaster General William T. Barry was the lone cabinet member to stay, and Eaton eventually received appointments that took him away from Washington, first as governor of Florida Territory, and then as minister to Spain. On June 17, the day before Eaton formally resigned, a story appeared in the Telegraph stating that it had been \\"proved\\" that the families of Ingham, Branch, and Attorney General John M. Berrien had refused to associate with Mr. Eaton. Eaton wrote to all three men demanding that they answer for the article. Ingham sent back a contemptuous letter stating that, while he was not the source for the article, the information was still true. On June 18, Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel through Eaton's brother in law, Dr. Philip G. Randolph, who visited Ingham twice and the second time threatened him with personal harm if he did not comply with Eaton's demands. Randolph was dismissed, and the next morning Ingham sent a note to Eaton discourteously declining the invitation, and describing his situation as one of \\"pity and contempt.\\" Eaton wrote a letter back to Ingham accusing him of cowardice. Ingham was then informed that Eaton, Randolph, and others were looking to assault him. He gathered together his own bodyguard, and was not immediately molested. However, he reported that for the next two nights Eaton and his men continued to lurk about his dwelling and threaten him. He then left the city, and returned safely to his home. Ingham communicated to Jackson his version of what took place, and Jackson then asked Eaton to answer for the charge. Eaton admitted that he \\"passed by\\" the place where Ingham had been staying, \\"but at no point attempted to enter ... or besiege it.\\" Aftermath Secretary of State Martin Van Buren supported the Eatons, aiding in his rise to the presidency. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun killed the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming his act would \\"...kill him, sir, kill him dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick.\\" However, Calhoun only made Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics, which were rooted largely in the Eaton controversy. This raised Van Buren even further in Jackson's esteem. Van Buren was nominated for vice president, and was elected as Jackson's running mate when Jackson won a second term in 1832. Van Buren thus became the de facto heir to the presidency, and succeeded Jackson in 1837. Although Emily Donelson had supported Floride Calhoun, after the controversy ended Jackson asked her to return as his official hostess; she resumed these duties in conjunction with Sarah Yorke Jackson until returning to Tennessee after contracting tuberculosis, leaving Sarah Yorke Jackson to serve alone as Jackson's hostess. John Calhoun resigned as vice president shortly before the end of his term, and returned with his wife to South Carolina.Cheatham, Mark R. and Peter C. Mancall, eds., Jacksonian and Antebellum Age: People and Perspectives, ABC- CLIO, 2008, 30-32. Quickly elected to the U.S. Senate, he returned to Washington not as a national leader with presidential prospects, but as a regional leader who argued in favor of states' rights and the expansion of slavery. In regard to the Petticoat affair, Jackson later remarked, \\"I [would] rather have live vermin on my back than the tongue of one of these Washington women on my reputation.\\"Widmer, Edward L. 2005. Martin Van Buren: The American Presidents Series, The 8th President, 1837‚Äì1841. Time Books. To Jackson, Peggy Eaton was just another of many wronged women whom over his lifetime he had known and defended. He believed that every woman he had defended in his life, including her, had been the victim of ulterior motives, so that political enemies could bring him down. According to historian Daniel Walker Howe, the episode influenced the emergence of feminism. The Cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all women were at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. The aristocratic wives of European diplomats in Washington shrugged the matter off; they had their national interest to uphold, and had seen how life worked in Paris and London. Legacy Historian Robert V. Remini says that \\"the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And it was all so needless.\\" Historian Kirsten E. Wood argues that it \\"was a national political issue, raising questions of manhood, womanhood, Presidential power, politics, and morality.\\" The 1936 film The Gorgeous Hussy is a fictionalized account of the Petticoat affair.

On the 12 April 2001, GNA turned into the French chapter of Free Software Foundation (FSF). At the end of 2003, the GNU Savannah server was replaced by FSF after a security compromise. A dispute broke out between FSF, who owned Savannah, and Savannah's maintainers, including developers of the Savannah software over the levels of administration the FSF should be given.

Starsailor marks the moment Buckley's folk rock origins became invisible as he fully incorporated jazz rock and avant-garde styles into his music. Although it alienated elements of his fanbase upon release, it also contains his best known song, \\"Song to the Siren\\". This more accessible song was written much earlier than Starsailor's newer material, originally in a more traditional folk arrangement, as shown on the later released compilation album Morning Glory: The Tim Buckley Anthology. Bunk Gardner, a former member of the Mothers of Invention, joined Buckley's normal band to record the album. Also, Buckley began working again with lyricist Larry Beckett, after a three-album absence. Leontyne Price attended a concert in New York City during the supporting tour and told Buckley, \\"Boy, I wish they were writing things like that for us opera singers,\\" to which Buckley responded, \\"Well, do what I did; get your own band.\\" \\"Starsailor\\" is a literal English rendering of the Greek-derived word \\"astronaut.\\" Renewed interest \\"Song to the Siren\\" has been covered by a variety of artists, most notably by This Mortal Coil, which featured on their 1984 album It'll End in Tears. John Frusciante, in 2009, covered this song on his album The Empyrean. Amen Dunes covered the song on their 2015 EP release Cowboy Worship. The British trance act Lost Witness also released a remix single, entitled \\"Did I Dream (Song to the Siren)\\". While the revival of \\"Song to the Siren\\" renewed interest in Buckley amongst independent artists in the 1980s, the success of his estranged son, Jeff Buckley, in the 1990s, inspired indie rock artists to look at the career of his father. The British band Starsailor took their name from this album. The album had a brief reissue on CD by the Enigma Retro label, but like the other Tim Buckley release on the Straight Records label (1969's Blue Afternoon), it drifted out of print due to legal battles over who owned the rights to the music. This stems back to a 1976 separation and lawsuit between Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa, the co-owners of Straight Records. As a result, many of the albums released on Straight (including Captain Beefheart's Lick My Decals Off, Baby) are very difficult to find on CD. In 2006, the album was released on the iTunes Music Store, making it available to the general public once more. In 2007, 4 Men With Beards reissued the album on vinyl, as well as the rest of Tim Buckley's nine-album catalogue. However, CD copies of this and Blue Afternoon remained out of print and difficult to find on the market until the release in 2017 of The Complete Album Collection box set. Reception and legacy Starsailor was featured at #50 in Pitchfork's 2004 list of The 100 Best Albums of the 1970s. Reviewer Dominique Leone said of the album, \\"Starsailor is a masterpiece in every sense. It captured its maker at his freest and most willing to throw caution and sales to the wind, while simultaneously at his most creative and most capable of pulling off songs and moods that, from practically anyone else, would sound cartoonish, clumsy and confused.\\" In addition, Starsailor was selected as the 47th best rock record of all time in the 1987 book The Top 100 Rock 'n' Roll Albums of All Time.Gambaccini, Paul.

Many modern academics hold that it was a single site, located at the modern 'Ain el-Qudeirat, while some academics and rabbinical authorities hold that there were two locations named Kadesh. A related term, either synonymous with Kadesh or referring to one of the two sites, is Kadesh (or Qadesh) Barnea. Various etymologies for Barnea have been proposed, including 'desert of wanderings,' but none have produced widespread agreement.Charles Trumbull (1884).

Others have identified Kadesh Barnea, not with Petra, but with Ein el QudeirƒÅt, or what is also called Tell QudeirƒÅt near Quseimah in the region of the central Negev, now belonging to Egypt (Ben-David Ben-Gad Hacohen, 1998 - pp. 28‚Äì29), arguing that Re·∏≥am (Petra) in Mishnah Gittin was not considered the Land of Israel, while Re·∏≥am of «¶ayƒÅh is listed as a frontier city of the Land of Israel. (See also Y. Aharoni, \\"Kadesh-barnea,\\" Encyclopaedia Biblica, 7:39-42; R. Cohen, \\"Kadesh-Barnea,\\" New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavation 3:843‚Äì847). The Bible mentions Kadesh and/or Kadesh Barnea in a number of episodes, making it an important site (or sites) in narratives concerning Israelite origins. Kadesh was the chief site of encampment for the Israelites during their wandering in the Zin Desert (Deuteronomy 1:46), as well as the place from which the Israelite spies were sent to Canaan (Numbers 13:1-26). The first failed attempt to capture Canaan was made from Kadesh (). Moses disobediently struck a rock that brought forth water at Kadesh (). Miriam () and Aaron () both died and were buried near a place named Kadesh. Moses sent envoys to the King of Edom from Kadesh (), asking for permission to let the Israelites use the King's Highway passing through his territory, which the Edomite king denied. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Kadesh (which he called Rekem) is identified with Petra, in Jordan. Kadesh Barnea is a key feature in the common biblical formula delineating the southern border of the Land of Israel (cf. , , etc.)Zecharia Kallai, \\"The Southern Border of the Land of Israel ‚Äî Pattern and Application\\", Vetus Testamentum XXXVII 4 1987, 438-445. and thus its identification is key to understanding both the ideal and geopolitically realised borders of ancient Israel. Petra (identified as Kadesh)  Biblical references  * \\"And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat--the same is Kadesh--and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon- tamar.\\" * \\"Wherefore the well was called 'Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\\" * \\"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.\\" * \\"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.\\" * \\"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.\\" * -16 \\"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: 'Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us; how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers; and when we cried unto the LORD, He heard our voice, and sent a messenger, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.\\" * \\"And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.\\" * -14 \\"And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered; because ye rebelled against My commandment in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes.'-- These are the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.\\" * -37 \\"And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin--the same is Kadesh.

The Bible locates Kadesh, or Kadesh Barnea, as an oasis south of Canaan, west of the Arabah and east of the Brook of Egypt. It is 11 days' march by way of Mount Seir from Horeb (Deuteronomy 1:2). By the late nineteenth century, as many as eighteen sites had been proposed for biblical Kadesh.Charles Trumbull (1884), Kadesh-Barnea: Its Importance and Probable Site, 303. One source of confusion has been the fact that Kadesh is sometimes mentioned in connection with the Desert of Paran (Numbers 13:26) and at other times with the Zin Desert (Numbers 20:1). This discrepancy has been noted by commentators as early as the Middle Ages. Some (e.g., Hezekiah ben Manoah) sought a reconciliatory model, while others (Abraham ibn Ezra and Nahmanides) proposed two separate sites named Kadesh. A minority of recent scholars have continued to maintain a two-site theory, with a western Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, and an eastern Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran, the latter often associated with Petra, Jordan.\\"A very few modern scholars have claimed that there were, indeed, two sites by the name of Kadesh.\\" Yigal Levin, Numbers 34:2-12, \\"The boundaries of the land of Canaan, and the empire of Necho,\\" Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society 30 2006, 65.Isaacs, Samuel Hillel.

Hebrew with English Abstract.Wenham, Gordon J. (2008). Numbers. p. 152. The two-site theory also appears to have been held by JosephusJewish Antiquities IV 82 cf. Numbers 20:1, 22-29 and Eusebius of Caesarea.E. Klostermann, Eusebius‚ÄîDas Omnosticon Der Biblischen Ortsnamen (Hildesheim, 1966), 113. Josephus identifies Miriam's burial site (which the Bible identifies as Kadesh) with Petra. After a period in which researchers identified Kadesh with the similarly-named Ein Qedeis, since 1905 modern Ain-el-Qudeirat in Wadi el-Ain of northern Sinai has been widely accepted as the location of Kadesh Barnea. Several Iron Age fortresses have been excavated there. The oldest, a small elliptical structure, dates to the tenth century BCE, and was abandoned for some time after its first destruction. A second fort, constructed during the eighth century BCE (probably during the reign of Uzziah) was destroyed during the seventh century BCE, most likely during Manasseh of Judah's reign. Two ostraca engraved in Hebrew, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, have been recovered there, suggesting Israelite occupation.\\"Kadesh Barnea\\" pg. 214 in the NIV Archaeological Study Bible, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2005Davies, Graham I., et al., \\"Ancient Hebrew Inscriptions: Corpus and Concordance, Volume 2\\", Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp82-85  Archaeological excavations  Excavations at Ain el-Qudeirat conducted by Dr. Rudolph Cohen, former head of the Israeli Antiquities Authority during the Israeli occupation of Sinai following the 1967 war uncovered copious remains of the Middle Bronze Age I period (MBA I or MBI, sometimes known as the Intermediate Bronze Age), which were also found at numerous other sites in the Negev. On the other hand, Late Bronze Age, the conventional time of the Exodus, is unattested in the Negev. In an article in Biblical Archaeology Review of July, 1983, Cohen put forward the suggestion that the Exodus took place at the start of MBI and that the MBI people were, in fact, the Israelites. The idea has not been widely adopted.

He appeared during the caliphate of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 744 AD. His original Berber name is unknown. According to Ibn Khaldun's sources, he claimed to have received a new revelation from God, with 80 chapters, some called after prophets, such as Adam, Noah, and others after other things, such as the Duck, the Camel, the Elephant, Harut and Marut, Iblis and \\"Chapter of the Wonders of the World\\"; they read these chapters in their prayers. He established laws for his people, and was called by them \\"·π¢ƒÅli·∏• al-Mu'minin\\" (Restorer of the Believers.) This claimed revelation was written in the Berber language, and called a Qur'an. He is also said to have claimed to be the final Mahdi, and that Isa (Jesus) would be his companion and pray behind him. He proclaimed that his name in Arabic was ·π¢ƒÅli·∏•, in Syriac MƒÅlik, in \\"Ajami\\"  ªƒÅlim, in Hebrew R≈´byƒÅ, and in Berber Werba, and that after him would be no other prophet. After reaching the age of 47 years, he headed east out of the kingdom, and promised to return in the reign of their seventh king. He told his son IlyƒÅs to support the Umayyads of Andalus and publicly profess Islam, but to reveal his religion when he became powerful enough; the latter was done by his grandson Y≈´nus. According to some sources, ·π¢ƒÅli·∏• ibn Tarƒ´f regarded himself as a successor to Muhammad, had 10 ·π¢ahƒÅba (disciples) and many wives, and claimed to be able to speak with the dead and heal the sick. Other tenets that contrast with Islam include capital punishment for theft, unlimited number of wives a man allowed to have, fasting of the month of Rajab (7th month in lunar calendar) instead of Ramadan (9th month), ten obligatory daily prayers instead of five, differences in how to perform ablution, prayers, and the banning of marriage between cousins. The details of the tenets of ·π¢ƒÅli·∏•'s religion are mentioned in many Arabic sources, such as Ibn Hazm, Ibn Khaldun and others. In Islamic literature, his belief is considered heretical; politically, its motivation was presumably to establish their independence from the Umayyads (in a manner analogous to Kharijism, and earlier Donatism), establishing an independent ideology lending legitimacy to the state. Some modern Berber activists regard him as a hero for his resistance to Umayyad- Arab conquest and his foundation of the Berghouata state. The religion promoted by ·π¢ƒÅli·∏• was destroyed in the 11th century by the Almoravids.

He is described as a son of Arpachshad and father of Salah, who lived in the time between Noah and Abraham. The postdiluvian Cainan does not appear in the (Proto-)Masoretic Text, the most common Hebrew version of Genesis, where Arpachshad is noted as the father of Salah. He is also omitted from the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus. Early Christian writers Irenaeus and Eusebius of Caesarea believed his presence to be an error mainly on the basis of his omission from the (Proto-)Masoretic Text, and many subsequent interpreters followed this. However Helen Jacobus has argued that the omission from the Masoretic text is deliberate. Despite his name being omitted from the Masoretic text, a substantial number of traditions about this other Cainan exist in the history of literature: According to the Book of Jubilees, Cainan was taught to read by his father, and he found, carved on the rocks by former generations, an inscription preserving the science of astrology as taught by the Watchers, who had rebelled from God before the deluge. He is also stated to have married a daughter of Madai named Melka. The Sefer ha-Yashar describes Cainan, the possessor of great astrological wisdom, which had been inscribed on tables of stone, as the son of Seth and not of Arpachshad; i.e., the antediluvian Kenan grandson of Seth according to the Bible.

First published by Macmillan of Canada in 1975, this novel focuses on the life-story of the fictional conjuror Magnus Eisengrim.  Plot  Magnus Eisengrim (also known by at least four other names throughout the trilogy) tells the story of his life to a group of filmmakers who are producing a biographical film about the great magician Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin for the BBC. They are headed by the world-famous Swedish director Jurgen Lind (evidently modeled on Ingmar Bergman). Also present during the story are Eisengrim's friends Dunstan Ramsay and Liesl, who both appear in the earlier installments of the Deptford Trilogy. Ramsay reprises the role of narrator which he played in the first novel, Fifth Business, but in this case it is only to add context and continuity to the internal narration of Eisengrim. The life story of Eisengrim pulls together many events found throughout the previous two novels, showing them from an entirely different perspective.  Section summary   A Bottle in the Smoke  This section deals with Paul's life travelling with Wanless World of Wonders carnival as well as playing in vaudeville theatres during the winters. The section title derives from the biblical reference to a bottle as a goatskin that has been cured and hardened by smoke from a fire. Paul has similarly been hardened by his experiences at the hands of Willard, the magician who abducts Paul and subjects him to sexual abuse.  Merlin's Laugh  In this section, Paul has arrived in London and is recruited as a stunt double to Sir John Tresize, actor-manager of a stage company. After playing stages in London and elsewhere in Britain, the troop does a long tour in Canada. Paul, who is called Mungo Fetch within the company, is strongly influenced by both Tresize and his wife, \\"Milady\\". In the telling, Magnus reveals that Ingestree as a young man had also joined Tresize's troop and had embarrassed himself in several ways. Magnus also shows how Ingestree later revenged himself on Tresize by a spiteful act.  Le Lit de Justice  In this epilogue section, Liesl, Magnus, and Dunstan share a large bed (lit) in the Savoy hotel in London after the completion of the film. Dunstan and Liesl question Magnus based on his earlier revelations, and the mystery of the death of Boy Staunton is finally resolved.  Primary characters  * Magnus Eisengrim ‚Äì As the main focus of the novel, much of the story revolves around Eisengrim telling his life story in order to explain his context for playing the character of Robert Houdin. * Dunstan Ramsay ‚Äì The narrator and good friend of both Eisengrim and Liesl. * Liesl * Jurgen Lind * Roland Ingestree ‚Äì Executive producer of the film for the BBC * Kinghovn ‚Äì Lind's cameraman  Themes  The book contains an extended treatment of the paedophilic abuse inflicted on the young Eisengrim by his abductor who repeatedly sodomizes him and uses him to obtain morphine, but in turn teaches him hand magic.

He was a leading figure of anarchism in Spain.  Career  Juan Garc√≠a Oliver was born in 1901. He apprenticed as a cook and in 1919, assisted in the formation of the waiters' union, affiliated with the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Garc√≠a Oliver later organized workers in Reus, led the CNT's provincial committee, was jailed during a strike action, and joined the armed-struggle group Los Solidarios. During the Spanish Restoration, Garc√≠a Oliver worked as a polisher in France, where he unsuccessfully plotted to kill King Alfonso XIII and Benito Mussolini. He was jailed upon his reentry to Spain in 1926 but was released with the coming of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. As a leading insurrectionist in the period, he joined the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica, advocated for full revolution with the CNT, and fought in the streets of Barcelona. Garc√≠a Oliver came to lead the militias. In 1936, he became the defense minister of the Generalitat de Catalunya and the justice minister in the Francisco Largo Caballero administration. Garc√≠a Oliver destroyed the archives of convicts and worked to curtail terrorism. During the May Days, he encouraged the CNT fighters to disarm. Garc√≠a Oliver reluctantly subordinated the goal of revolution to win the civil war, but after Catalonia fell in 1939, he would remain in exile for the rest of his life, first in France, then Sweden, and finally Mexico. He continued to argue for unity for the rest of his life. In 1978, two years before his death, Garc√≠a Oliver published his autobiography, El eco de los pasos.

Although he came from a Calvinist family, who had been exiled during the French Wars of Religion, Jean, through cultivating connections with Henry IV eventually was restored to a portion of his patrimony. Early life Hotman was the eldest son of the famous jurist and author Fran√ßois Hotman. He was born in Lausanne because his family was in exile during the Wars of Religion in France. His father, although heir to an estate, did not take the title of Marquis because his adherence to Protestantism distanced him from his extended family. Due in part to the religious conflicts, the family moved often. From 1555 to 1563, they were in Strasbourg, from 1563 to 1566 in Valence, from 1566 to 1572, in Bourges, from 1572 to 1578 in Geneva. In 1578, they moved for the last time to Basel where Jean's father Francis would die in 1590. Jean studied law at Valence, graduating before 1568. He later went to Paris in 1578, and through his father's influence, was named a tutor in the household of the English Ambassador to Paris, Sir Amias Paulet (ambassador 1576‚Äì1579). He tutored Amias' two sons, Anthony and George. When Amias was recalled to England in November 1579, Jean followed him there to continue tutoring his sons. Sir Francis Bacon also traveled with Sir Amias during this time 1577‚Äì78, and it is possible they knew each other. Middle life In March 1580, Jean, Anthony and George settled at Oxford where he became acquainted with many current or soon-to-be famous persons. Jean graduated from the University of Oxford in 1581, with a doctorate in law. Anthony Paulet would later receive an M.A. and eventually succeeded his father as Governor of Jersey(see DNB, XV, pg 527). His three-years-younger brother George took another route with a good marriage (see DNB, XV, pg 528). While at Oxford, Jean fell in with a group of fellows including Richard Hakluyt, Henry Cuffe (1563‚Äì1601) and Sir Philip Sidney. Through Philip Sidney and Amias Paulet, Hotman caught the attention of Philip's uncle Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the Chancellor of the University, who around May/Oct 1582, engaged him as one of his secretaries. This brought Hotman to the court of Queen Elizabeth. Despite this, he moved back to the continent. He was at Caen in 1584, where he was nominated \\"prieur du college des droits\\", but he left when they would not pay him. About 1584 or 1585, he was married, probably in France, to Renee de St Martin, the former lady-in-waiting to Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich. And on 14 January 1585, he was appointed counsellor and master of requests by Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV. He returned to England, where he followed Leicester to the Low Countries in May 1585, and when Leicester returned to England, he left Hotman behind as his agent, with the special commission to pacify the troubles in Utrecht. He performed this task well and wrote to Leicester but had the effrontery to write directly to Queen Elizabeth for which Leicester upbraided him. This did not lead to a permanent breach for \\"When Leicester after his second stay in the Netherlands, returned to England (Dec 1587), Hotman was one of his retinue.\\" (Posthumus, pg 40) In 1588, he was appointed Prebendary of Ilfracombe with an income of 28 pounds, although mostly eaten up by taxes and expenses. In March 1588, he was entered at Gray's Inn, but apparently did not embark on a legal career. In Scotland In August 1589 Hotman travelled to Scotland, to Edinburgh and then met the king James VI at Falkland Palace.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 135-6, 144, 147. James VI gave him a jewel and a ring with a diamond set in a star.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 56, 65. Hotman left Edinburgh and stayed at Whittingehame Tower on 20 August 1589 with Richard Douglas.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 144. He may have travelled in the company of the poet Henry Constable.Roderick J. Lyall, Alexander Montgomerie: Poetry, Politics, and Cultural Change in Jacobean Scotland (Arizona, 2005), p. 179. Later life Upon the death of his father in 1590, he returned to France to settle the estate and became the guardian of his three unmarried sisters. One of these, Suzanne has a marriage contract dated 1594 in Paris. She is perhaps the most well-known of his sisters, having known modern descendants in Canada and the United States, which has made her and especially her husband, the subject of a few scholarly articles. In his treatise that was translated into English in 1603 as \\"The Ambassador\\", John Hotman warned diplomats against hiring servants from the country to which they were assigned for fear these hirelings would act as spies. He even recommended that ambassadors take their wives with them to supervise their households in order to prevent its members from revealing sensitive information to outsiders. At one point, he apparently received in France the title of Comte (Count) d'Hotman. Sometime before 1619, he was French ambassador to the Duchy of Berg at D√ºsseldorf.

It is typically available in an aerosol spray can, and may sometimes be used for starting direct injected diesel engines or lean burn spark engines running on alcohol fuel. Some modern starting fluid products contain mostly volatile hydrocarbons such as heptane, (the main component of natural gasoline) with a small portion of diethyl ether, and carbon dioxide (as a propellant). Some formulations contain butane or propane as both propellant and starting fuel. Historically, Diethyl ether, with a small amount of oil, a trace amount of a stabilizer and a hydrocarbon propellant has been used to help start internal combustion engines because of its low autoignition temperature. Diethyl ether is distinct from petroleum ether (a crude oil distillate consisting mostly of pentane and other alkanes) which has also been used for starting engines. Usage Four stroke engines Starting fluid is sprayed into the engine intake near the air filter, or into the carburetor bore or a spark plug hole of an engine to get added fuel to the combustion cylinder quickly. Using starting fluid to get the engine running faster avoids wear to starters and fatigue to one's arm with pull start engines, especially on rarely used machines. Other uses include cold weather starting, vehicles that run out of fuel and thus require extra time to restore fuel pressure, and sometimes with flooded engines. Mechanics sometimes use it to diagnose starting problems by determining whether the spark and ignition system of the vehicle is functioning; if the spark is adequate but the fuel delivery system is not, the engine will run until the starting fluid vapors are consumed. It is used more often with carbureted engines than with fuel injection systems. Caution is required when using starting fluid with diesel engines that have preheat systems in the intake or glow-plugs installed, as the starting fluid may pre- ignite, leading to engine damage. Two stroke engines Starting fluid is not recommended for regular use with some two-stroke engines because it does not possess lubricating qualities by itself. Lubrication for two-stroke engines is achieved using oil that is either mixed into the fuel by the user or injected automatically into the fuel supply; engines requiring premixed fuel that are run solely on starting fluid do not receive an adequate supply of lubrication to their crankcase and cylinder(s). Engines that haven't been run recently are especially vulnerable to damage from oil starvation; starting fluid, a strong solvent, tends to strip residual oil off of cranks and cylinder walls, further reducing lubrication during the period of fuel starvation. WD-40 was previously recommended for use on two stroke engines because it has lubricating qualities, but the formulation with non-flammable CO2 as propellant instead of propane no longer has the same propulsive effect. Abuse Diethyl ether has a long history as a medical anesthetic; when starting fluid was mostly ether, a similar effect could be obtained using it. Use at the present time directly as an inhalant includes the effect of the petroleum solvents, which are more toxic as inhalants than diethyl ether.http://www.medem.com/medlib/article/ZZZ5B6O2B7C Sometimes referred to as \\"passing the shirt,\\" the starting fluid is sprayed on a piece of cloth and held up to one's face for inhalation. This trend has gradually picked up since the turn of the century, as phrases such as \\"etherized\\" and \\"ethervision\\" have gained popularity. The effects of inhalation vary, but have been known to include lightheadedness, loss of coordination, paranoia, and sometimes hallucinations.

It was founded in Hangzhou in 1928 by the government of the Republic of China and the renowned educator Cai Yuanpei. It was the first art university and first graduate school in Chinese history. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines. At the time, China Academy of Art's goal was to promote fine arts education as a replacement for religion in the then war-torn China. Fine arts has been held as equal to a religion at the institution for almost eight decades. The academy has many renowned artists in its alumni and is considered one of the most prestigious art institutions in the country. It is colloquially called Guomei (). Introduction China Academy of Art is the most influential academy of fine arts with the most complete range of degree offerings and programs of study in China. It houses a diverse pool of artistic talent, has a distinctive structure integrating theory and practice, focuses on human care and social needs, and combines modern technical and cultural disciplines with traditional artistic ones. The academy features the study of theories and offering Ph.D., Master's and bachelor's degrees of fine arts, design, architecture, film and new media, which constitute the humanities and reflect the Chinese national spirit and creative theories of the era. There are 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students in three campuses with a faculty and staff of 800. The administration is headquartered in the Nanshan Campus, which is on the West Lake in Hangzhou. Students in the Master's program live on the alternate campus 40 minutes away, on the outskirts of Hangzhou. A free bus is offered to transport students to and from the campus from the dorms at designated times. Undergraduate students typically spend one year in general education courses in the Department of Foundation and then three years in the core courses of their particular majors. Graduate courses are typically three years long and include experience in the studio and research with mentoring faculty. History In 1928, the National Academy of Art (ÂúãÁ´ãËóùË°ìÈô¢) was founded in China on the bank of the West Lake in Hangzhou by the educator Cai Yuanpei with Lin Fengmian. It was administrated by Yi Tingbai and Zhuang ziman during the 1940s. Over the decades, the location of the academy has changed ten times; its name changed six times, as follows: *1928 - National Academy of Art (ÂúãÁ´ãËóùË°ìÈô¢) **National Academy of Art was the first Chinese art university and graduate school *1929 - Hangzhou National College of Art (ÂúãÁ´ãÊù≠Â∑ûËóùË°ìÂ∞àÁßëÂ≠∏Ê†°) **The Western painting department was divided into several studios, most of which practiced modern, semiabstract styles. The atmosphere was very similar to an American art college in its freedom of expression. After the second year of their five-year program, students chose a studio in which to continue their studies. Lin Fengmian advocated a synthesis of Chinese and modern Western art, and insisted that students not emulate his work but develop their own styles. Among the other professors, Wu Dayu taught late impressionist and cubist styles; Fang Ganmin was influenced by Cubism; and Guan Liang taught a style derived from Fauvism. Although the students were strictly trained in academic drawing, they were encouraged to be free and creative. *1938 - National College of Art (ÂúãÁ´ãËóùË°ìÂ∞àÁßëÂ≠∏Ê†°) **The War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, National Peping School of Art merged into National Hangzhou School of Art, a new national school formed. * 1945 - After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Academy had been reestablished in Hangzhou with the Chinese painter Pan Tianshou as director. **The establishment of the People's Republic of China saw a shift in the government's attitude to and policy on art and artistic education. Many of the senior faculty of the then National Academy of Art, particularly practitioners of modern Western art, failed to understand or refused to accept the revolutionary ideologies and principles. Many, including Lin Fengmian, Fang Ganmin, Wu Dayu and Guan Liang, gradually drifted back to Shanghai. Others, including the traditionalist Pan Tianshou, were reassigned to minor administrative positions, no longer permitted to teach. Lin Fengmian applied for permission to leave China but was refused. The vacant teaching positions were soon filled with fresh graduates who had successfully mastered revolutionary styles and principles. *1950 - East-China Campus of Central Academy of Fine Arts (‰∏≠Â§ÆÁæéË°ìÂ≠∏Èô¢ËèØÊù±ÂàÜÈô¢) **after Chinese Civil War, CPC (‰∏≠ÂúãÂÖ±Áî¢Èª®) controlled mainland China and founded a new art academy CAFA in Beijing to cement Beijing's new capital position.

Medical use Vardenafil's indications and contraindications are the same as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to sildenafil citrate (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis). The difference between the vardenafil molecule and sildenafil citrate is a nitrogen atom's position and the change of sildenafil's piperazine ring methyl group to an ethyl group. Tadalafil is structurally different from both sildenafil and vardenafil. Vardenafil's relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil's. Beyond its indications for erectile dysfunction, vardenafil may be effective in the treatment of premature ejaculation, where it may significantly increase the time from penetration to ejaculation. Adverse reactions The common, adverse drug reactions (side effects) are the same as with other PDE5 inhibitors. The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, photosensitivity, abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, itch, and priapism. One possibly serious, but rare, side effect with vardenafil is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, vardenafil use may cause priapism, a very painful emergency condition that can cause impotence if left untreated. On 18 October 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that a warning about possible deafness (sudden hearing loss) would be added to the drug labels of vardenafil, and other PDE5 inhibitors.  Interactions  Vardenafil, as with all PDE5 inhibitors, should not be used by people taking nitrate medications, because combining them with vardenafil might provoke potentially life- threatening hypotension (low blood pressure). Further, vardenafil causes lengthening of the QT interval. Therefore, it should not be taken by people taking other medications that affect the QT interval (such as amiodarone). History Vardenafil was co-marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, and Schering-Plough under the trade name Levitra. As of 2005, the co-promotion rights of GSK on Levitra have been returned to Bayer in many markets outside the U.S. In Italy, Bayer sells vardenafil as Levitra and GSK sells it as Vivanza. Thus, because of European Union trade rules, parallel imports might result in Vivanza sold next to Levitra in the EU. An orally disintegrating form, marketed as Staxyn and Levitra Soft, has been gaining approvals in countries such as the United States and Canada. Dose forms Levitra 20mg Oral Tablet It is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg doses in round orange tablets. The normal starting dose is 10 mg (roughly equivalent to 50 mg of sildenafil). Vardenafil should be taken 1 to 2 hours prior to sexual activity, with a maximum dose frequency of once per day. In some territories, such as the UK, only certain doses may be available. Vardenafil is also available under the name Staxyn as a tablet which dissolves on the tongue rather than being swallowed in the form of a pill. Tainted supplements The USFDA has found vardenafil and other synthetic PDE5 inhibitors in numerous products marketed as \\"herbal\\" supplements or \\"all natural\\" products for male enhancement.

Madame de Villeneuve, la M√©connue,\\" Femmes savants et femmes d'esprit: Women Intellectuals of the French Eighteenth Century, edited by Roland Bonnel and Catherine Rubinger (New York: Peter Lang, 1997) 100. was a French author influenced by Madame d'Aulnoy, Charles Perrault, and various pr√©cieuse writers. Villeneuve is particularly noted for her 1740 original story of La Belle et la B√™te, which is the oldest known variant of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast.  Biography  Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve was born and died in Paris, but belonged to a powerful Protestant family from La Rochelle. She was the descendant of the notable Amos Barbot who was a Peer of France and a Deputy of the Estates General in 1614. His brother, Jean Amos, became mayor of La Rochelle in 1610. Another relation, Jean Barbot (1655-1712) was an early explorer of West Africa and the Caribbean, who worked as an agent on slave ships. He published his travel journals in French and English when he migrated to England to escape the prosecution of Protestants after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685. In 1706, Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve married Jean-Baptiste Gaalon de Villeneuve, a member of an aristocratic family from Poitou. Within six months of her marriage, she requested a separation of belongings from her husband who had already squandered much of their substantial joint family inheritance. A daughter was born from the marriage but no records indicate if she survived. In 1711, Gabrielle-Suzanne became a widow at the age of 26. She progressively lost her family fortune and was forced to seek a means of employment to support herself. Eventually, she made her way to Paris where she met Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon, or Cr√©billon p√®re, the most famous playwright of tragedies of the period. It is likely she began co-habitating with Cr√©billon p√®re in the early 1730s (although the earliest documented date is 1748), and remained with him until her death in 1755. Gabrielle-Suzanne assisted Cr√©billon p√®re with his duties as the royal literary censor, and thus became knowledgeable about the literary tastes of the Parisian reading public.  Major works  Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve published both fairy tales and novels. Her publications include a novella Le Ph√©nix conjugal (1734) (The Conjugal Phoenix), two collections of fairy tales, La Jeune Am√©ricaine ou les Contes marins (1740), and Les Belles Solitaires (1745), and four novels, Le Beau-fr√®re suppos√© (1752), La Jardini√®re de Vincennes (1753) (The Gardener of Vincennes), Le juge pr√©venu (1754) (The Biased Judge), and the M√©moires de Mesdemoiselles de Marsange (1757) (Memoirs of Mlles de Marsange). La Jardini√®re de Vincennes was considered her masterpiece and greatest commercial success. The Bibliographie du genre romanesque fran√ßais 1751-1800 lists 15 editions of her novel.  Beauty and the Beast  Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve is particularly noted for her original 1740 story of La Belle et la B√™te, which is the oldest known modern variant of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast found in her La jeune am√©ricaine, et les contes marins. The tale is novel length, and influenced by the style of seventeenth-century novels, as it contains many subplots or intercalated stories, most notably the histories of Beauty and the Beast. The Beast is \\"b√™te\\" in both senses of the French word: a beast and lacking intelligence (i.e. stupid). After her death, Villeneuve's tale was abridged, rewritten, and published by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in her Magasin des enfants to teach young English girls a moral lesson. In her widely popular publication, she gave no credit to Villeneuve as the author of La Belle et la B√™te and thus Leprince de Beaumont is often referred to as the author of this famous fairytale. Her shortened version is the one most commonly known today. The Beast, a prince, lost his father at a young age. His mother had to wage war to defend his kingdom, and left him in the care of a rather evil fairy. This fairy attempted to seduce him as the prince became an adult. When he refused, she transformed him into the beast until someone would agree to marry him without knowing his past or that he was intelligent. In a neighboring kingdom, Beauty is the daughter of a king and a different fairy. Beauty's mother broke the laws of fairy society by falling in love with a human, so she was sentenced to remain in the fairy land and Beauty was sentenced to marry a hideous beast when she grew up. After Beauty's mother disappeared from earth, the evil fairy unsuccessfully attempted to take Beauty's life and marry her father. Beauty's aunt, another good fairy, intervened and changed Beauty's place with the dead daughter of a merchant for Beauty's protection, then placed the Beast in a magically hidden castle until Beauty grew up.

It has a chemical formula of FeCr2O4. It is an oxide mineral belonging to the spinel group. The element magnesium can substitute for iron in variable amounts as it forms a solid solution with magnesiochromite (MgCr2O4). A substitution of the element aluminium can also occur, leading to hercynite (FeAl2O4). Chromite today is mined particularly to make stainless steel through the production of ferrochrome (FeCr), which is an iron-chromium alloy. Chromite grains are commonly found in large mafic igneous intrusions such as the Bushveld in South Africa and India. Chromite is iron-black in color with a metallic luster, a dark brown streak and a hardness on the Mohs scale of 5.5.  Properties  Chromite minerals are mainly found in mafic-ultramafic igneous intrusions and are also sometimes found in metamorphic rocks. The chromite minerals occur in layered formations that can be hundreds of kilometres long and a few meters thick. Chromite is also common in iron meteorites and form in association with silicates and troilite minerals.  Crystal structure  The chemical composition of chromite is Fe2+Cr3+2O4. Chromite, when presented as an ore, or in massive form, forms as fine granular aggregates. The structure of the ore can be seen as platy, with breakages along planes of weakness. Chromite can also be presented in a thin section. The grains seen in thin sections are disseminated with crystals that are euhedral to subhedral. Chromite contains Mg, ferric iron [Fe(III)], Al and trace amounts of Ti. Chromite can change into different minerals based on the amounts of each element in the mineral. Chromite is a part of the spinel group, which means that it is able to form a complete solid solution series with other members in the same group. These include minerals such as chenmingite (FeCr2O4), xieite (FeCr2O4), magnesiochromite (MgCr2O4) and magnetite (Fe2+Fe3+2O4). Chenmingite and xieite are polymorphs of chromite while magnesiochromite and magnetite are isostructural with chromite.  Crystal size and morphology  Chromite occurs as massive and granular crystals and very rarely as octahedral crystals. Twinning for this mineral occurs on the {III} plane as described by the spinel law. Grains of minerals are generally small in size. However, chromite grains up to 3 cm have been found. These grains are seen to crystallize from the liquid of a meteorite body where there are low amounts of chromium and oxygen. The large grains are associated with stable supersaturated conditions seen from the meteorite body.  Reactions  Chromite is an important mineral in helping to determine the conditions that rocks form. It can have reactions with various gases such as CO and CO2. The reaction between these gases and the solid chromite grains results in the reduction of the chromite and allows for the formation of iron and chromium alloys. There could also be a formation of metal carbides from the interaction with chromite and the gases. Chromite is seen to form early in the crystallization process. This allows for chromite to be resistant to the alteration effects of high temperatures and pressures seen in the metamorphic series. It is able to progress through the metamorphic series unaltered. Other minerals with a lower resistance are seen to alter in this series to minerals such as serpentine, biotite and garnet.  Distribution of deposits  A chromite prospect in Yukon. The black bands are chromite, which also carries platinum group metals. Gray rock is bleached ultramafics. Chromite is found as orthocumulate lenses of chromitite in peridotite from the Earth's mantle. It also occurs in layered ultramafic intrusive rocks. In addition, it is found in metamorphic rocks such as some serpentinites. Ore deposits of chromite form as early magmatic differentiates. It is commonly associated with olivine, magnetite, serpentine, and corundum. The vast Bushveld Igneous Complex of South Africa is a large layered mafic to ultramafic igneous body with some layers consisting of 90% chromite making the rare rock type, chromitite.Guilbert, John M., and Park, Charles F., Jr. (1986) The Geology of Ore Deposits, Freeman, The Stillwater Igneous Complex in Montana also contains significant chromite. Chromite is found in large quantities that is available for commercial mining. The chromite minerals are found in 2 main deposits, which are stratiform deposits and podiform deposits. Stratiform deposits in layered intrusions are the main source of chromite resources and are seen in countries such as South Africa, Canada, Finland, and Madagascar. Chromite resources from podiform deposits are mainly found in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Albania. Zimbabwe is the only country that can obtain chromite resources from both stratiform and podiform deposits.  Stratiform deposits  Stratiform deposits are formed as large sheet-like bodies, usually formed in layered mafic to ultramafic igneous complexes. This type of deposit is used to obtain 98% of the worldwide chromite reserves. Stratiform deposits are typically seen to be of Precambrian in age and are found in cratons. The mafic to ultramafic igneous provinces that these deposits are formed in were likely intruded into continental crust, which may have contained granites or gneisses. The shapes of these intrusions are described as tabular or funnel- shaped. The tabular intrusions were placed in the form of sills with the layering of these intrusions being parallel. Examples of these tabular intrusions can be seen in the Stillwater Igneous Complex and Bird River. The funnel-shaped intrusions are seen to be dipping towards the center of the intrusion. This gives the layers in this intrusion a syncline formation. Examples of this type of intrusion can be seen in the Bushveld Igneous Complex and the Great Dyke. Chromite can be seen in stratiform deposits as multiple layers which consist of chromitite. Thicknesses for these layers range between 1 cm to 1 m. Lateral depths can reach lengths of 70 km. Chromitite is the main rock in these layers, with 50‚Äì95% of it being made of chromite and the rest being composed of olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and the various alteration products of these minerals. An indication of water in the magma is determined by the presence of brown mica.  Podiform deposits  Podiform deposits are seen to occur within the ophiolite sequences. The stratigraphy of the ophiolite sequence is deep-ocean sediments, pillow lavas, sheeted dykes, gabbros and ultramafic tectonites. These deposits are found in ultramafic rocks, most notably in tectonites. It can be seen that the abundance of podiform deposits increase towards the top of the tectonites. Podiform deposits are irregular in shape. \\"Pod\\" is a term given by geologists to express the uncertain morphology of this deposit. This deposit shows foliation that is parallel to the foliation of the host rock. Podiform deposits are described as discordant, subconcordant and concordant. Chromite in podiform deposits form as anhedral grains. The ores seen in this type of deposit have nodular texture and are loosely-packed nodules with a size range of 5‚Äì20 mm. Other minerals that are seen in podiform deposits are olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, pargasite, Na-mica, albite, and jadeite.  Health effects  Chromite ore can be mined to produce chromite concentrate. It can also be crushed and processed. Chromite concentrate, when combined with a reductant such as coal or coke and a high temperature furnace can produce ferrochrome. Ferrochrome is a type of ferroalloy that is an alloy in between chromium and iron. This ferroalloy, as well as chromite concentrate can introduce various health effects. Chromite ore is found in underground conditions. Therefore, when exposed to aboveground conditions, various effects will occur. Some of these effects include weathering and oxidation. The element chromium is most abundant in chromite in the form of trivalent (Cr- III). When chromite ore is exposed to aboveground conditions, Cr-III can be converted to Cr-VI, which is the hexavalent state of chromium. Cr-VI is produced from Cr-III by means of dry milling or grinding of the ore. This mostly has to do with the moistness of the milling process as well as the atmosphere in which the milling is taking place. A wet environment and a non- oxygenated atmosphere are ideal conditions to produce less Cr-VI, while the opposite is known to create more Cr-VI. Production of ferrochrome is observed to emit pollutants into the air such as nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides and sulfur oxides, as well as dust particulates with a high concentration of heavy metals such as chromium, zinc, lead, nickel and cadmium. During high temperature smelting of chromite ore to produce ferrochrome, Cr-III is converted to Cr-VI. As with chromite ore, ferrochrome is milled and therefore produces Cr-VI. Cr-VI is therefore introduced into the dust when the ferrochrome is produced. This introduces health risks such as inhalation potential and leaching of toxins into the environment. Applications Chromite can be used as a refractory material, because it has a high heat stability. The chromium extracted from chromite is used in chrome plating and alloying for production of corrosion resistant superalloys, nichrome, and stainless steel. Chromium is used as a pigment for glass, glazes, and paint, and as an oxidizing agent for tanning leather. It is also sometimes used as a gemstone.Tables of Gemstone Identification By Roger Dedeyne, Ivo Quintens, p.189  Porcelain tile pigmentation  Porcelain tiles are often produced with many different colours and pigmentations. The usual contributor to colour in fast-fired porcelain tiles are black pigment, which is fairly expensive and is synthetic. Natural chromite allows for an inexpensive and inorganic pigmentation alternative to the expensive and allows for the microstructure and mechanical properties of the tiles to not be substantially altered or modified when introduced.  Stainless steel manufacturing  Heating element with nichrome wires Chromium, which is mostly composed of chromite, is a main constituent in the manufacturing of stainless steel. Stainless steel contains 18% chromium. Chromium allows for the stainless steel to be hardened and toughened. It also allows for corrosion resistance at high temperatures. 90% of mined chromite ore is used for stainless steel production. Chromite ore production has been on a steady incline, which causes a rise in demand for the stainless steel markets.  Nichrome alloys  Chromite, when alloyed with iron and nickel creates an alloy called nichrome. Nichrome is described as being 80% nickel and 20% chromium. Due to the alloys that make nichrome, nichrome is seen to be heat resistant up to temperatures of 1250 ¬∞C (2282 ¬∞F). Due to the high heat resistance of nichrome, it is mainly used for heating units. Nichrome alloys also have very good mechanical properties which allow for good oxidation and corrosion properties.

Murania Press, 2009, (pp. 78-82). Background The Spider was created in 1933 by Harry Steeger at Popular Publications as direct competition to Street and Smith Publications' vigilante hero, the Shadow. Though similar, The Spider was millionaire playboy Richard Wentworth, who had served as a major in World War I, and was living in New York City unaffected by the financial deprivations of the Great Depression. The ninth pulp represents him as the last surviving member of a rich family. Wentworth was easily identified as The Spider by his enemies in a number of earlier novels and was arrested by the police but quickly escaped. He adopted a disguise, Tito Caliepi, and associated aliases. The Spider's earliest costume consisted of a simple black domino mask, black hat, and cape. Later in the series, vampire-like makeup appeared, which was replaced with a face mask featuring grizzled hair and finally a hunchback. These were added to terrorize the criminal underworld, while The Spider dispensed his brand of violent vigilante justice. (Actor and comedian Harold Lloyd previously had used a similar mask, lank hair wig, and hunchback in the comedy film Dr. Jack (1922)). Utilizing his talent with a violin, Wentworth, posing as Caliepi, sometimes used begging as part of his disguise. At other times, Wentworth also ventured into the underworld disguised as small-time hood Blinky McQuade in order to gain needed information. To Scotland Yard, Wentworth was known as Rupert Barton, who held a badge of Inspector for services rendered; by the fifth novel, he also held the rank of Lieutenant in the FBI. Wentworth, according to the fifth story, was 5'11\\" tall, and had grey eyes and an old battle scar on his head that would flare up at times of great stress. He was an accomplished pianist and violinist, and he drove a Lancia. He could speak fluent Hindustani and so talk with Ram Singh in his own language, with little fear anyone else would understand what was being said. Page's Wentworth was also psychologically vulnerable and suffered \\"frequent bouts of fear, self-doubt, despair and paranoia\\". The Spider stories often involved a bizarre menace to the country and a criminal conspiracy, and were often extremely violent, with the villains engaging in wanton slaughter of thousands as part of sometimes nationwide crime sprees: pulp magazine historian Ed Hulse notes that \\"Spider novel death tolls routinely ran into the thousands\\". The master criminal of the stories was usually unmasked only in the last few pages. The stories often ended with Wentworth killing the villains and stamping their corpses' foreheads with his \\"Spider\\" mark. The first two novels were written by Reginald Thomas Maitland Scott, but they were deemed too slow-paced, so another author was brought in. Later stories were published under the house name of Grant Stockbridge. Most of the Spider novels were written by Norvell Page. Other authors of the series included Donald C. Cormack, Wayne Rogers, Emile C. Tepperman, and Prentice Winchell. The cover artists for The Spider magazine were Walter M. Baumhofer for the debut issue, followed by John Newton Howitt and Rafael De Soto. The Spider was published monthly and ran for 118 issues from 1933 to 1943. A 119th Spider novel manuscript had been completed but was not published until decades later, then as a heavily rewritten mass-market paperback with retitled characters (see paperback novels section below). The Spider sold well during the 1930s, and copies are still valued by modern pulp magazine collectors. Hulse has stated \\"Today, hero-pulp fans value The Spider more than any single-character magazine save The Shadow and Doc Savage.\\" Supporting characters Nita Van Sloan, is Wentworth's longtime fianc√©e, who often aided him. Though they are as close as man and wife, they know they could never marry and have a family, as Wentworth believes he will eventually be unmasked or killed as The Spider, and his wife and family would then pay the price. In the issue #100 story, \\"Death and The Spider\\", Wentworth expected to die. Nita disguises herself as The Spider a few times, covering for Wentworth when he has been seriously injured. Ram Singh, a Sikh (originally Hindu), is Wenthworth's fanatically loyal manservant; he is a deadly knife thrower and usually carries several knives with him, including the deadly kukri. Ram Singh never views his position as a servant as demeaning or negatively impacting his self-respect, feeling that he serves a man totally above other men. At times, he and Wentworth talk in Hindustani, which only they understand. Sergeant Ronald Jackson, Wentworth's chauffeur, had served under Wentworth in World War I and often referred to him as \\"the Major\\". He was killed by \\"The Avenger\\" in The Pain Emperor story (Feb 1935). However he was revived in \\"The Reign of the Death Fiddler\\" (May 1, 1935) when it was revealed that though near death, Ram Singh had saved him and brought him back to full health again. Harold Jenkyns is Wentworth's butler, an elderly man who has been in the Wentworth family's service for a long time. Police Commissioner Stanley Kirkpatrick or simply \\"Kirk\\", is Wentworth's main ally/antagonist, who is sure Wentworth is The Spider but can never prove it. He has promised to arrest him, try him, and send him to the electric chair if he ever has proof. Professor Ezra Brownlee, an inventor and Wentworth's old war colleague, features heavily in the early Spider novels; he is killed in Dragon Lord of the Underworld (July 1935). Brownlee's son makes some appearances afterward, taking over from his late father. Enemies Despite The Spider's tendency to kill his enemies, he encounters several foes more than once, such as The Fly and MUNRO, a master of disguise. Some storylines featuring a struggle against a single villain lasted for several consecutive issues, such as The Spider's four-part battle against The Living Pharaoh, and The Spider's three-part battle against The Master and his Black Police (reprinted decades later as The Spider vs The Empire State)Page, Norvell, 2009. \\"The Spider vs The Empire State\\". Age of Aces. Pg. 6. .. Other enemies he encountered had names like the costumed super-villains of comic books, such as Judge Torture, Red Feather, The Bloody Serpent, The Brain, The Emperor of Vermin, The Red Mandarin, The Silencer, and The Wreck. The names of two Spider villains, The Bat Man and The Iron Man, were later adopted for DC and Marvel comic book superheroes. The Spider's seal and weapons One of The Spider's distinguishing features is his \\"calling card.\\" Wentworth often leaves a red-ink \\"spider\\" image (like a drop of blood) on the foreheads of the criminals he kills, so others will not be blamed. In the sixth novel (1934), the Spider imprints his red sign on a gold ring so that any who need his help can use it by taking it to Kirkpatrick (where Wentworth will find out about it). During the same time period, in the same benign fashion, and perhaps inspired by The Spider's calling card, Lee Falk's long- running 1936 syndicated comic strip hero, The Phantom, left a distinct skull mark in the faces of those enemies he fought, made by the ring he wore. The Spider's seal, however, was concealed in the base of his platinum cigarette lighter and was invented by Professor Brownlee. The Spider also carried a thin silken line (his \\"web\\") which had a tensile strength of several hundred pounds. Brownlee also invented the lethal and almost silent air pistol the Spider used for \\"quiet\\" kills. He acted as a sort of on-call weaponsmith for Wentworth, whom he looked upon as being close to a son. Wentworth also had a gun in one of his shoes in the early issues, which he used twice is issue 5. Wentworth was also a master of disguise. In the small steel case of burglar tools he carried under his arm, he also had his make-up kit and (in the early novels) his Spider's eye mask. In Timothy Truman's 1990s comic book adaptation, Brownlee created the \\"Web-Lee\\", a non-lethal stun pistol that fired projectiles which erupted into a spider web-like mass, inundated with microscopic barbs of frozen curare. Like The Shadow, The Spider's usual weapons of choice were a pair of Browning .45 caliber M1911 automatic pistols; he was a crack shot and normally shot to kill. However, he would not shoot anyone in law enforcement, although they frequently were under orders to shoot to kill him on sight. Master of Men The Spider's by-name was \\"Master of Men\\", indicating that he had a voice commanding enough to get many people to do his bidding. Wentworth could also imitate other people's voices. When he imitated Kirkpatrick's voice, he could give orders to lesser policemen during a stakeout, even during one intended to capture The Spider, so he could himself escape. Wentworth was not above disguising himself as a cop to escape when surrounded by policemen. Movie serials The Spider Returns\\" (Columbia 1941). Columbia Pictures produced two Spider movie serials, both 15-chapter cliffhangers starring Warren Hull as Richard Wentworth. The first, The Spider's Web (1938), was also the first film serial to be made from a popular pulp magazine series character. In this serial The Spider battles The Octopus and his henchmen who attempt to disrupt all commercial and passenger transportation systems, and later all U. S. industry; Spider pulp magazine novelist Norvell Page was one of the writers who worked on the serial's screenplay. In the second serial, The Spider Returns (1941), The Spider battles the mysterious crime lord The Gargoyle and his henchmen, who threaten the world with acts of sabotage and wholesale murder in an effort to wreck the U. S. national defense. Both serials feature a dramatic wardrobe enhancement to The Spider's magazine appearance: his black cape and head mask are over- printed with a white spider's web pattern and then matched with his usual plain black fedora. This striking addition gave the silver screen Spider an appearance more like that of a traditional superhero, like other pulp and comics heroes being adapted for the era's movie serials; it also made the serial Spider look less like the very popular Street and Smith pulp hero The Shadow, which had also been produced by Columbia Pictures. Novel reprints Many, if not all, of the original 118 Spider pulp magazine novels have been reprinted over the years in both mass-market paperback and trade paperback editions or some other form. Berkley Books (then Berkley/Medallion) first reprinted the Spider in 1969 and 1970, intending to reprint all 118 novels in order, hoping to tap into the reprint phenomenon of the Doc Savage novels being published by Bantam Books. However, these first paperback reissues met with poor sales after only four volumes, and the planned series was canceled. In the mid-1970s Pocket Books reprinted four Spider novels, featuring \\"modern\\" pulp cover artwork by Robert A. Maguire. In this series, The Spider is portrayed as a non-costumed, heavily armed muscular blond hero. These paperbacks also failed to find an audience, and the series was canceled. These four novels were re-edited and modernized, one of several reasons why they may have never caught on with their intended audience. In the reprint of Death and the Spider (originally published in 1940), Nita Van Sloan is shown driving a Jaguar E-type X-KE, a sports car not created until 1961, some 19 years later. At roughly the same time in England, Mews Books/New American Library reprinted four Spider novels sporting new cover art, different in style and execution from those used by Pocket Books. This Spider mass market series also ended after only four titles. An unusual Spider publishing event happened right \\"out of the blue\\" in 1979. Python Publishing published the never-before-seen last original Spider novel, Slaughter, Inc. (written by Donald G. Cormack), originally to have been published as The Spider issue #119. Python published it as a one-shot mass market paperback. For copyright reasons, all of the characters' names were changed, the story was retitled Blue Steel: The Ultimate Answer To Evil, and the author was listed as \\"Spider Page\\" (no doubt a sly reference to the novel's original author, Norvell Page). The Spider was recast as a character named Blue Steel. As with Pocket Books' Spider editions, this paperback sported a modernized pulp cover painting featuring a non- costumed, but heavily armed, blond hero (that cover appears to be an unused cover painting by artist George Gross, finished but never used for a Freeway Press reprint of another pulp magazine character, Operator No. 5). In 2012 Moonstone Books finally published the unpublished Spider novel Slaughter, Inc. in its original unedited form. The novel was again reprinted in 2018 by Altus Press as a facsimile edition, this time designed to look exactly like The Spider #119 pulp would have looked in the 1940s. In 1980 Dimedia, Inc. reprinted three Spider pulp novels in the larger trade paperback format. In 1984, they continued with three mass market Spider novel reprints, one in 1984 and two in 1985. These last three sported brand new cover paintings of the original costumed Spider by artists Ken Kelly (on volumes one and two) and Frank Kelly Freas (on volume three). In the early 1990s Carroll & Graf Publishers issued a series of eight mass market Spider paperbacks, each one in a double-novel format. All used original The Spider pulp magazine artwork for their covers. These 16 novels became the longest-running Spider reprint series done for the mass market paperback book market. One cover was a newly done painting by Rafael DeSoto, the original artist. After Carroll & Graf, several specialized small press pulp reprint houses tried a complete reprinting of The Spider series. Bold Venture Press published ten issues of The Spider (#'s 5,6,7,8,16,26,31 and 50)http://spiderreturns.com/reprints/current.html. Wildside Press offered two The Spider reprints (#'s 78 and 92)http://wildsidepress.com/home.asp. Girasol Collectibles has been the most dogged of them all. It has reissued the novels as both a series of single pulp novel facsimile editions as well as re-typeset stories in \\"pulp double novel\\" trade paperbacks. Both series use The Spider pulp magazine artwork for their covers. They published 25 of these double-novel issues (a total of 50 novels reprinted in all)https://adventurehouse.com/shop/product-category/girasol- collectables/https://www.google.com/search?q=girasol+spider+reprints&sxsrf;=ACYBGNRtHcfGtn1PNatAwj22XIYIHieoNA:1581715200185&source;=lnms&tbm;=isch&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwi38pGl_NHnAhUQTN8KHV3SDHEQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw&biw;=1600&bih;=757. In 2007, New York science fiction publisher Baen Books published a single trade paperback featuring three Spider novel reprints. In 2008, they released a second companion trade paperback of Spider reprints. In 2009, Baen issued both volumes as mass market paperbacks.\\"[spiderreturns.com/reprints/baen.html Baen Books - The Spider Returns],\\" Spider Returns (retrieved June 23, 2016) One of the three novels in the second omnibus stars another Popular Publications pulp character, The Octopus. The Baen editions sported new Spider cover paintings by noted graphic designer and comics artist Jim Steranko. In 1970, for Pyramid Books and HBJ/Jove Books, Steranko illustrated 27 (of 28 covers) for their mass market novel reissues of rival pulp hero The Shadow (the cover for Mobsmen On The Spot reused a George Rozen original Shadow pulp magazine cover). Steranko also illustrated additional new covers for five of The Shadow novels' second printings. Also in 2007, Moonstone Books published an original anthology of brand new Spider short stories entitled The Spider Chronicles. In 2013, Moonstone published a second anthology, The Spider: Extreme Prejudice featuring 12 more new Spider short stories. In late 2009, Doubleday's Science Fiction Book Club reprinted in hardcover Baen's second Spider three-in-one volume from the previous year. This became the first Spider hardcover edition ever published. In August 2009, Age of Aces reprinted The Spider's Black Police trilogy in a single volume which they titled \\"The Spider vs. The Empire State\\". This trilogy consisted of three 1938 issues that were connected plotwise - #60 (September 1938), #61 (October 1938) and #62 (November, 1938).Page, Norvell, 2009. \\"The Spider vs The Empire State\\". Age of Aces. Pg. 6. In October 2012, Moonstone Books published an original Spider novel, Shadow of Evil, by CJ Henderson. The Vintage Library has 34 licensed Spider novel reprints available in the PDF format. For a small fee, each one can be downloaded from their website. Facsimile Spider novels continue to appear in print from other publishers; they have also been issued in the Kindle e-book format. In August, 2018 Altus Press launched The Wild Adventures of The Spider book series. The first entry was written by Will Murray. The Doom Legion saw Richard Wentworth team up with James Christopher, aka Operator 5, and G-8, two of Popular Publications top heroes. A sequel, Fury in Steel has been announced for 2020. Altus has recently begun reprinting the entire Spider series in its original publication order, the books being currently issued on a monthly basis. Spider comics and graphic novels In the early 1990s, The Spider and its characters were reinterpreted in comic book form by Timothy Truman for Eclipse Comics. As noted in Comics Scene #19, Truman set his version of The Spider in the \\"1990s as seen by the 1930s\\". Elements of this version of The Spider's milieu included airships as common transportation, the survival of the League of Nations into the near past (Wentworth meets Ram Singh during an intervention into India/Pakistan), and World War II, if it ever happened, taking place differently. This series featured an African-American Commissioner Kirkpatrick. Moonstone Books started a new Spider graphic novel series, in which installments are structured more like illustrated prose stories than traditional panel-by-panel comics. In March 2011, the same publisher offered the first issue of a more traditional Spider comic book, with art by veteran creator Pablo Marcos. In August 2011, Dynamite Entertainment announced that they were going to produce a brand new, updated Spider comic book series, written by novelist David Liss; the first issue was released in May 2012. The Spider's costume in this series is based on the one worn by actor Warren Hull in Columbia's 1940s Spider movie serials, but the black costume's web lines are rendered in blood red instead of white. This comics series depicts The Spider and his allies fighting crime in a modern-day U. S. In 2013, Dynamite announced that issue #18 of The Spider would be its last. In December 2012, Dynamite released the first issue of Masks, an eight-issue comic book miniseries that teams The Spider with Dynamite's other pulp hero-based comic book characters, including: the Green Hornet and Kato, The Shadow, and a 1930s descendant of Zorro, among others. Together, they fight a powerful criminal syndicate, which, along with its gangster henchmen, secretly controls New York City through the corrupt and powerful Justice Party, which has seized complete control over the city and its citizens. This miniseries, set in the Depression Era of the 1930s, is not in the same universe/story continuity as Dynamite's main Spider comic book series. The story is based on The Spider Magazine novels \\"The City That Paid To Die\\", \\"The Spider at Bay\\", and \\"Scourge of the Black Legions\\" all written by Norvell Page. Page was not credited in this adaption. The completed Masks miniseries was then gathered by Dynamite into a one-volume graphic novel. References Further reading *Barbour, Alan G.

The state trunkline highway is also known as the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, named for the prominent auto industry union head by the Michigan Legislature in 1971. I-696 is a bypass route, detouring around the city of Detroit through the city's northern suburbs in Oakland and Macomb counties. It starts by branching off I-96 and I-275 at its western terminus in Farmington Hills, and runs through suburbs including Southfield, Royal Oak and Warren before merging into I-94 at St. Clair Shores on the east end. It has eight lanes for most of its length and is approximately north of downtown Detroit. I-696 connects to other freeways such as I-75 (Chrysler Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway). Local residents sometimes refer to I-696 as \\"The Autobahn of Detroit\\". Planning for the freeway started in the 1950s. Michigan state officials proposed the designation I-98, but this was not approved. Construction started on the first segment in 1961, and the Lodge Freeway was designated Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) the following year. The western third of the freeway opened in 1963, and the eastern third was completed in January 1979. The central segment was the subject of much controversy during the 1960s and 1970s. Various municipalities along this stretch argued over the routing of the freeway such that the governor locked several officials into a room overnight until they would agree to a routing. Later, various groups used federal environmental regulations to force changes to the freeway. The Orthodox Jewish community in Oak Park was concerned about pedestrian access across the freeway; I-696 was built with a set of parks on overpasses to accommodate their needs. The Detroit Zoo and the City of Detroit also fought components of the freeway design. These concessions delayed the completion of I-696 until December 15, 1989. Since completion, the speed limit was raised from . In addition, some interchanges were reconfigured in 2006. Route description alt=See caption I-696, which has been called \\"Detroit's Autobahn\\" by some residents, reflecting a reputation for fast drivers, begins in the west in the city of Novi as a left exit branching off I-96. This ramp is a portion of the I-96/I-696/I-275/M-5 interchange that spans the north‚Äìsouth, Novi‚ÄìFarmington Hills city line linking together five converging freeways. The freeway curves southeasterly and then northeasterly through the complex as it runs eastward through the adjacent residential subdivisions. I-696 passes south of 12 Mile Road in the Mile Road System through Farmington Hills, passing south of Harrison High School and north of Mercy High School. After crossing into Southfield, I-696 passes through the Mixing Bowl, another complex interchange that spans over near the American Center involving M-10 (Lodge Freeway and Northwestern Highway) and US Highway 24 (US 24, Telegraph Road) between two partial interchanges with Franklin Road on the west and Lahser Road on the east. The carriageways for I-696 run in the median of M-10 from northwest to southeast. East of this interchange, cargo restrictions have been enacted for the next segment of I-696; no commercial vehicles may carry flammable or explosive loads; the segment passes belong grade and between retaining walls that are tall, which would hinder evacuation in the event of a fire. During construction in April 1989, vandals set a fire under one of the plazas, and officials were concerned about the intensity of the fire and the potential for a \\"horizontal towering inferno\\" along the freeway section once opened to traffic. alt=Photograph of After passing through the Mixing Bowl, I-696 follows 11 Mile Road, which forms a pair of service drives for the main freeway. The Interstate passes through the city of Lathrup Village before turning southward and then easterly on an S-shaped path to run along 10 Mile Road. This segment of freeway is known for its extensive use of retaining walls; three large landscaped plazas form short tunnels for freeway traffic near the Greenfield Road exit. The freeway passes next to the Jewish Community Center of Metropolitan Detroit as it passes under the third pedestrian plaza. The Interstate then picks up 10 Mile Road, which forms a pair of service drives, as the Reuther runs along the border between the cities of Oak Park and Huntington Woods. I-696 follows the southern edge of the Detroit Zoo. Immediately east of the zoo, the Interstate intersects M-1 (Woodward Avenue), and crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger service between Detroit and Pontiac. alt=Photograph showing an East of the rail crossing, I-696 has a four-level stack interchange with I-75 over the quadripoint for Royal Oak, Madison Heights, Hazel Park and Ferndale. This interchange marks the eastern end of the cargo restrictions. I-696 jogs to the northeast near the Hazel Park Raceway, leaving 10 Mile Road. Crossing into Warren in Macomb County at the Dequindre Road interchange, the freeway begins to follow 11 Mile Road again. Near the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, I-696 has another stack interchange for Mound Road; through the junction, the freeway makes a slight bend to the south. The freeway continues east through the northern edge of Center Line, crossing a line of Conrail Shared Assets and heading back into Warren. The Interstate crosses into Roseville near the M-97 (Groesbeck Highway) interchange and then meets M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) just west of the eastern terminus at I-94 (the Edsel Ford Freeway) in St. Clair Shores. The service drives merge in this final interchange and 11 Mile Road continues due east to Lake St.Clair. Like other state highways in Michigan, I-696 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average 185,700 vehicles used the freeway daily east of I-75 and 38,100 vehicles did so each day in part of the Mixing Bowl, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-696 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History Planning and initial construction alt=Detroit inset from the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955 (Yellow Book) I-696 is part of the original Interstate Highway System as outlined in 1956‚Äì58. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department, the freeway would have been numbered I-98. Construction started in 1961. The Lodge Freeway, the first segment of which opened in 1957, was given the Business Spur I-696 designation in 1962. The first segment of I-696 built was the western third of the completed freeway which opened in 1963‚Äì64 at a cost of $16.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). This section ran from the I-96 in Novi east to the Lodge Freeway in Southfield. The then-unfinished freeway was named for Walter P. Reuther, former leader of the United Auto Workers labor union after he and his wife died in a plane crash on May 9, 1970. The next year the Michigan Legislature approved the naming by passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 57. In the late 1970s, during the second phase of construction, lobbying efforts and lawsuits attempted to block construction of the central section. If successful, the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first (western) and second (eastern) phases of construction. During this time, MDOT assigned M-6 to the eastern section of the freeway under construction. Signs were erected along the service roads that followed 11 Mile Road to connect the already built stack interchange at I-75 east to I-94. By the time the eastern freeway segment was initially opened in January 1979 between I-94 and I-75, the signage for M-6 was removed and replaced with I-696 signage; it cost $200 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete. Later in 1979, a closure was scheduled to allow work to be completed on three of the segment's nine interchanges. Controversies over middle segment alt= July 1988 photograph showing the barricades directing traffic to divert off I-696 at the Mixing Bowl The central section was the most controversial. Governor James Blanchard was 15 years old and a high school sophomore in neighboring Pleasant Ridge when the freeway was proposed and purchased a home in the area in 1972. He joked during remarks at the dedication in 1989, \\"The unvarnished truth about this freeway? I wasn't even alive when it was first proposed,\\" and added, \\"frankly, I never thought it would go through.\\" Total cost at completion for the entire freeway at the end of the 30-year project was $675 million (equivalent to $ in ). Arguments between local officials were so intense that during the 1960s, then-Governor George W. Romney once locked fighting bureaucrats in a community center until they would agree on a path for the freeway. During the 1970s, local groups used then-new environmental regulations to oppose the Interstate. The freeway was noted in a Congressional subcommittee report on the \\"Major Interstate System Route Controversy in Urban Areas\\" or the controversies in 1970. Before 1967, local communities had to approve highway locations and designs, and the debates over I-696 prompted the passage of an arbitration statute. That statute was challenged by Pleasant Ridge and Lathrup Village before being upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court. Lathrup Village later withdrew from a planning agreement in 1971; had that agreement been implemented, construction on the central section was scheduled to commence in 1974 and finish in 1976. alt=Aerial photograph of the The community of Orthodox Jews in Oak Park wanted the freeway to pass to the north of their suburb. When this was deemed to be futile, the community asked for changes to the design that would mitigate the impact of the freeway to the pedestrian-dependent community. Final approval in 1981 of the freeway's alignment was contingent on these mitigation measures. To address the community's unique needs, the state hired a rabbi to serve as a consultant on the project. In addition, a series of landscaped plazas were incorporated into the design, forming the tunnels through which I-696 passes. These structures are a set of three bridges that cross the freeway within a mile (1.6 km). They allow members of the Jewish community to walk to synagogues on the Sabbath and other holidays when Jewish law prohibits driving. These plazas had their length limited; if they were longer, they would be considered tunnels that would require ventilation systems. The Detroit Zoo was concerned that noise and air pollution from the Interstate would disturb the animals. They were satisfied by $12 million (equivalent to $ in ) spent on a new parking ramp and other improvements. The City of Detroit tried to stop I-696 as well, but in the end the city was forced to redesign its golf course. A refusal to grant an additional of right-of-way by Detroit forced additional design and construction delays during the 1980s. One of the last obstacles to construction of the freeway was a wetlands area near Southfield. MDOT received a permit from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to destroy of wetland and create a replacement area. In the process, some prairie roses and wetlands milkweed were transplanted from the path of I-696 in 1987. The final section of the eight-lane freeway opened at a cost of $436 million (equivalent to $ in ) on December 15, 1989. At the time, one caller to a Detroit radio show commented, \\"do you realize we have been to the moon and back in the time it has taken to get that road from Ferndale to Southfield?\\" Since completion As part of the overall rehabilitation to the Mixing Bowl interchange, a new interchange at Franklin Road was to be constructed in 2006. An exit ramp from I-696 eastbound to American Drive opened in April 2006. An entrance ramp from Franklin Road to I-696 westbound opened in July 2006. The Franklin Road overpass, which had been closed during this time, re-opened in October 2006. On November 9 that year, the speed limit was increased from along the length of I-696. Exit list Related trunkline Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) was the designation given to the Lodge Freeway in the Detroit area in 1962. This freeway was renumbered as part of US 10 in 1970, when that highway designation was shifted off Woodward Avenue.

History Theatre Square and the conservatory, as seen in 1913 The conservatory was founded in 1862 by Anton Rubinstein, a Russian pianist and composer. On his resignation in 1867, he was succeeded by Nikolai Zaremba. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov was appointed as a professor in 1871, and the conservatory has borne his name since 1944. In 1887, Rubinstein returned to the conservatory with the goal of improving overall standards. He revised the curriculum, expelled inferior students, fired and demoted many professors, and made entrance and examination requirements more stringent. In 1891, he resigned again over the Imperial demand of racial quotas. The current building was erected in the 1890s on the site of the old Bolshoi Theatre of Saint Petersburg, and it still preserves its grand staircase and landing.

A skilled diplomat with ties to the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope, Hermann oversaw the expansion of the military order into Prussia. Biography Hermann von Salza was born to a dynasty of ministeriales of the Thuringian landgraves, probably at Dryburg Castle in Langensalza. With Landgrave Louis III of Thuringia he may have already taken part in the 1189/91 Siege of Acre, where the Teutonic Order was founded. He possibly also joined Landgrave Hermann I and the Henneberg count Otto von Botenlauben on the Crusade of 1197 and witnessed the coronation of King Amalric II of Jerusalem. The crusade was aborted upon the death of Emperor Henry VI, whereafter the Teutonic Knights were re-established as a military order under Grand Master Heinrich Walpot von Bassenheim to secure the conquered estates of the Holy Land. The precise time of Hermann's entry into the Order is unknown, but he first appears as Grand Master at the coronation of Count John of Brienne as King of Jerusalem in 1210. As such he may have spent some time in the Mediterranean Sea region during the first year of his rule. During this period the activities of the Knights were extended from Spain to Livonia. Hermann was a friend and councilor of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, for whom he represented as a mediator in the Papal curia from 1222 onwards. Pope Honorius III also recognized Hermann's capabilities, and granted the Teutonic Knights an equal status with the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar, after it had gone into decline under previous Grand Masters. Marienburg Castle. At the request of King Andrew II of Hungary in 1211, Hermann led the placing of Teutonic Knights in the Burzenland in Transylvania to defend against the Cumans. Hungarian nobles complained of the order's presence, however, and they were forced to leave by 1225. Meanwhile, Hermann accompanied Frederick on the Fifth Crusade against Damietta in 1219, and he was decorated for bravery by John of Brienne. Hermann later convinced Frederick to undertake the Sixth Crusade, and was partially responsible for Frederick's marriage to Yolanda, John of Brienne's daughter. Upon his return to Europe, Hermann helped to lift Frederick's excommunication. He was then requested by Konrad I of Masovia to fight the pagan Old Prussians. After Hermann had gained approval from both the Pope and the Emperor the knights began their lengthy campaign to Christianize Prussia in 1230. Hermann's subsequent visits with the Pope or the Emperor brought new privileges and donations to the Order. He was also able to obtain the incorporation of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword into the Teutonic Order in 1237. The importance of Hermann's role as mediator between Pope Gregory IX and the emperor can be seen by the fact that all communication between Frederick and the pope broke off with Hermann's death. Within the Teutonic Order, however, the knights began to grow dissatisfied at the absence of their Grand Master, so they recalled him and had him withdraw from his political life. However, he was less successful as a religious leader, and soon retired to Salerno in 1238. He died there in 1239.  Legacy  A marble bust of Hermann stood as a secondary figure at the side of the Brandenburg margrave Albrecht II (Sculptor Johannes Boese) in the former Berlin Siegesallee. It has been in the Spandau Citadel since May 2009. Albrecht had participated in the founding meeting of the order in 1198 in Akkon and had already met the Grand Master on the Third Crusade (1189‚Äì1192). A memorial plaque for Hermann von Salza was included in the Walhalla memorial near Regensburg. During the Second World War, Panzer Division SS-Panzer-Abteilung 11 was named Hermann von Salza.

It was the third series of American tests, following Trinity in 1945 and Crossroads in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military. The successful testing of the new cores in the Operation Sandstone tests rendered every component of the old weapons obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, production of the old cores was halted, and all effort concentrated on the new Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. More efficient use of fissionable material as a result of Operation Sandstone would increase the U.S. nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949. Origins alt=Map of Enewetak Atoll. The coral reef gives the atoll a circular shape. Most of the islands are at the northern end, including the three used as test sits. The main island of Enewetak is in the south. Nuclear weapons were developed during World War II by the Manhattan Project, which created a network of production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two types of bombs were developed: the Mark 1 Little Boy, a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235, and the Mark 3 Fat Man, an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium. These weapons were not far removed from their laboratory origins. A great deal of work remained to improve ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended during the war that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development. Norris Bradbury, who replaced Robert Oppenheimer as director at Los Alamos, felt that \\"we had, to put it bluntly, lousy bombs.\\" Plutonium was produced by irradiating uranium-238 in three 250 MW nuclear reactors at the Hanford site. In theory they could produce of plutonium per megawatt-day, or about per month. In practice, production never approached such a level in 1945, when only between was produced per month. A Fat Man core required about of plutonium, of which 21% fissioned. Plutonium production fell off during 1946 due to swelling of the reactors' graphite neutron moderators. This is known as the Wigner effect, after its discoverer, the Manhattan Project scientist Eugene Wigner. These reactors were also required for the production (by irradiation of bismuth-209) of polonium-210, which was used in the initiators, a critical component of the nuclear weapons. Some of bismuth-209 had to be irradiated for 100 days to produce 600 curies of polonium-210, a little over . Because polonium-210 has a half-life of only 138 days, at least one reactor had to be kept running. The oldest unit, B pile, was therefore closed down so that it would be available in the future. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found. Uranium-235 was derived from enrichment of natural uranium at the Y-12 plant and K-25 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Improvements in the processes and procedures of the electromagnetic and gaseous isotope separation between October 1945 and June 1946 led to an increase in production to around of uranium-235 per month, which was only enough for one of the very wasteful Little Boys. A Fat Man was 17.5 times as efficient as a Little Boy, but a ton of uranium ore could yield eight times as much uranium-235 as plutonium, and on a per-gram basis, plutonium cost somewhere between four and eight times as much to produce as uranium-235, which at this time cost around $26 per gram. Weapon development 1945‚Äì48 The objectives of the Sandstone series of tests were to: # test nuclear cores and initiators; # improve the theory and knowledge of implosion type weapons; # test levitated cores; # test composite cores; and # determine the most economic designs in terms of efficient use of fissionable material. Levitation meant that instead of being immediately inside the tamper, there would be an air gap between the tamper and the core, which would be suspended inside on wires. This would allow the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The principle was similar to swinging a hammer at a nail versus putting the hammerhead directly on the nail and pushing as hard as possible. In order for this to work outside the laboratory, the wires had to be strong enough to withstand being dropped from an aircraft, but thin enough to not disturb the spherical symmetry of the implosion. The Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, known as T Division, had run computer calculations on the levitated core as early March 1945. The use of the levitated core had been proposed during the planning for Operation Crossroads, but it had been decided instead to use the existing solid core \\"Christy\\" design. This was named after its designer, Robert Christy. For Sandstone, however, it was decided that at least two of the three tests would use levitated cores. The motivation behind the composite core was to make better use of the available fissionable material. The use of uranium-235 in an implosion weapon instead of the inefficient gun type Little Boy was an obvious development. However, while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium-235, it fissions faster, because it makes better use of the neutrons its fission produces. On the other hand, the slower reaction of uranium-235 permits the assembly of super-critical masses, making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields. By July 1945, Oppenheimer and Groves were considering using both materials in a composite core containing of plutonium and of uranium-235. The composite cores became available in 1946. Los Alamos' priority then became the development of an all- uranium-235 core. By January 1948 the national stockpile contained 50 cores, of which 36 were composite Christy cores, nine were plutonium Christy cores, and five were composite levitated cores. Testing the new levitated, composite and uranium-235 cores would require at least three test firings. More efficient weapons would require less efficient initiators. This meant that less polonium would be required. At the time of Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator. Preparations Organization Briefing on the . Pictured are Colonel T. J. Sands, Captain alt=Nine men sit around a large table. Another is standing, leaning over the table. On the wall behind them are maps of the Pacific Ocean and Enewetak Atoll. The tests were authorized by President Harry S. Truman on June 27, 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's Director of Military Applications, Brigadier General James McCormack and his deputy, Captain James S. Russell, met with Bradbury and John Henry Manley at Los Alamos on July 9 to make arrangements for the tests. They readily agreed that they would be scientific in nature, with Los Alamos supplying the technical direction and the armed forces providing supplies and logistical support. The cost of the tests, around $20 million, was divided between the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission. Lieutenant General John E. Hull was designated as test commander. Rear Admiral William S. Parsons and Major General William E. Kepner reprised their Operation Crossroads roles as deputy commanders. Joint Task Force 7 was formally activated on October 18, 1947. As its commander, Hull was answerable to both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Atomic Energy Commission. Joint Task Force 7 consisted of 10,366 personnel, 9,890 of them military. Its headquarters consisted of about 175 men, of whom 96 were on board the . The rest were accommodated on the , and . A special division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, known as J Division, was created specifically to manage nuclear testing. An Atomic Energy Commission group (Task Group 7.1) was responsible for preparing and detonating the nuclear weapons, and conducting the experiments. It consisted of some 283 scientists and technicians responsible for nuclear tests from J Division, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, the Naval Research Laboratory, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the Atomic Energy Commission, Edgerton, Germeshausen & Grier, and other agencies. Each dealt with a different aspect of the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests. Ships The naval forces were organized as Task Group 7.3. It consisted of: ;Task Unit 7.3.1 * (flagship) ;Task Unit 7.3.2 Main Naval Task Unit  * USS LST-45 * USS LST-219 * ; Task Unit 7.3.3 Offshore Patrol  * * ; Task Unit 7.3.4 Helicopter Unit * ‚Äì 4 HO3S and 2 HTL helicopters ; Task Unit 7.3.5 Services Unit USS YOG-64 *USS YW-94 ;Task Unit 7.3.6 Cable Unit *USS LSM-250 *USS LSM-378 *Naval Signal Unit No. 1 ; Task Unit 7.3.7 Boat Pool Unit USS LCI-549 *USS LCI(L)-1054 *USS LCI(L)-1090 *USS LCI 472 *USS LCI-494 *USS LCI-l194 *USS LCI-1345 Source: Berkhouse et al, Operation Sandstone, p. 40 Civil affairs alt=Banana shaped helicopter hovers over water In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was designated test director on October 14, and Joint Task Force 7's scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set out with a group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific. Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on October 11. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads. As the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States, the United Nations Security Council was notified of the upcoming tests on December 2. The atoll was inhabited by the dri-Enewetak, who lived on Aomon, and the dri-Enjebi, who lived on Bijire. Their original homes had been on Enewetak and Enjebi, but they had been moved during the war to make way for military bases. The population, about 140 in number, had been temporarily relocated to Meck Island during Operation Crossroads. This time, Ujelang Atoll, an uninhabited atoll southwest of Enewetak, was selected as a relocation site. A Naval Construction Battalion group arrived there on November 22 to build accommodation and amenities. The military authorities met with the local chiefs on December 3, and they agreed to the relocation, which was carried out by by December 20. An LST and four Douglas C-54 Skymaster aircraft were placed on standby to evacuate Ujelan in case it was affected by fallout, but were not required. Unlike the Crossroads tests, which were conducted in the media spotlight, the Sandstone tests were carried out with minimal publicity. On April 15, there was still discussion in Washington about whether or not there should be any public announcement of the tests at all. Hull opposed making any announcement until after the series was completed, but the AEC commissioners felt that the news would leak out, and the United States would look secretive. It was therefore decided to make a last minute announcement. There was no announcement of the purpose of the tests, and only cursory press releases. On 18 May, after the series was over, Hull held a press conference in Hawaii, but only permitted the media to quote from written statements. Construction Enjebi, Aomon, and Runit Islands were cleared of vegetation and graded level to make it easier to install the required instrumentation, and a causeway was built between Aomon and Bijire so the instrument cables could be run from the test tower on Aomon to the control station on Bijire. The detonations were ordered so that later test areas would suffer minimal fallout from the earlier shots. The Army component, Task Group 7.2, was responsible for construction work. It consisted of the 1220th Provisional Engineer Battalion, with the 1217th and 1218th Composite Service Platoons, the 18th Engineer Construction Company and 1219th Signal Service Platoon; Companies D and E of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade's 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment; the 461st Transportation Amphibious Truck Company; 854th Transportation Port Company; 401st CIC Detachment; and the Naval Shore Base Detachment. Operations As in Operation Crossroads, each detonation was given its own code name, taken from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. All used modified Mark III assemblies, and were detonated from towers. The timing of the detonations was a matter of compromise. The gamma ray measurement experiments required darkness, but the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress drones that would sample the clouds needed daylight to control them. As a compromise, the Sandstone detonations all took place shortly before dawn. The detonations in the United States' Sandstone series are listed below: { \\"wikitable sortable\\" + United States' Sandstone series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Name !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Date time (UT) !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Local time zone !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Location !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Elevation + height !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Delivery, !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Device !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" \\"unsortable\\"  Yield !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" \\"unsortable\\"  Notes !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" \\"unsortable\\"  References - !

It was detonated on Enjebi just before sunrise at 06:17 on April 15, 1948, with a yield of 37 kilotons. The efficiency of utilization of the plutonium was about 35%; that of the uranium-235 was 25% or more. This was somewhat higher than Los Alamos' prediction. Observers watching from ships in the lagoon saw a brilliant flash and felt the radiant heat. A condensation cloud in diameter quickly enveloped the fireball, which glowed within the cloud. It took 45 to 50 seconds for the thunderous roar of the explosion to reach the observers. About 20 minutes later, Bairoko launched a helicopter to check on the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later. Yoke alt=Fireball cloud lights up the clouds in red and yellow, like a sunrise. The Yoke nuclear device used a levitated all-uranium-235 core. It was detonated on Aomon just before sunrise on May 1, 1948 at 06:09, a day late due to unfavorable winds. The observers saw a similar flash and felt the same heat as the X-Ray blast, but the wide condensation cloud was larger, and the sound of the explosion more forceful. One observer likened it to the sound of \\"a paper bag which is forcefully burst in a small room\\". They were correct: its yield of 49 kilotons made it the largest nuclear detonation up to that time, but it was considered inefficient and wasteful of the fissile material. Zebra Zebra, the third test, and the last of the Sandstone series, was detonated on Runit just before sunrise at 06:04 on May 15, 1948. This test was characterized by AEC Chairman David Lilienthal as the \\"hardest and most important\\" test of the three. By using one of the B-class initiators, it demonstrated that these could still be used with confidence. The observers perceived the flash and blast as similar to the previous two tests, but this time the base of the condensation cloud was at , which gave the observers an unobstructed view of the fireball, which therefore appeared to be brighter and last longer than the other two. Looks were deceiving: its levitated uranium-235 core produced a yield of 18 kilotons. Filters are being removed from a US Air Force alt=A propeller aircraft sits on a runway. A tracked vehicle with a crane lifts something above it. In the background are a jeep, three Quonset huts and palm trees. The procedures used in the previous tests were repeated, but this time the winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean. Outcome The successful testing of the new cores in the Sandstone tests had a profound effect. Practically every component of the old weapons was rendered obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, Bradbury had halted production of the old cores, and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on the Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. The more efficient use of fissionable material would increase the nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949. The Mark III bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950. At the same time, new production plants were coming online and the Wigner effect problem had been solved. By May 1951, plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947, while uranium-235 production had increased eight-fold. The Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, saw clearly that the era of scarcity was over. He now \\"recommended that we should be thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds.\\" Notes References  * * External links  * Category:Explosions in 1948 Sandstone Category:1948 in military history Category:1948 in the environment Category:1940s in the Marshall Islands Category:1948 in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands Category:April 1948 events Category:May 1948 events Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Operation Sandstone"},{"id":"649320","text":"Operation Ranger was the fourth American nuclear test series.

Conducted at the new Pacific Proving Ground, on islands of the Enewetak Atoll, all of the devices were mounted in large steel towers, to simulate air bursts. This series of nuclear weapons tests was preceded by Operation Ranger and succeeded by Operation Buster-Jangle. Operation Greenhouse showcased new and aggressive designs for nuclear weapons. The main idea was to reduce the size, weight, and most importantly, reduce the amount of fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons, while increasing the destructive power. With the Soviet Union's first nuclear test a year and half earlier, the United States had begun stockpiling the new designs before they were actually proven. Thus the success of Operation Greenhouse was vital before the development of thermonuclear weapons could continue. A number of target buildings, including bunkers, houses and factories were built on Mujinkarikku Islet to test nuclear weapon effects. George Interpolated film footage of the Operation Greenhouse - George test shot. The George explosion was the world's first thermonuclear burn, though it was just a test design, unsuitable for weaponization. Shaped like a torus, the George device had a small amount of heavy isotopes of liquid hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) placed at its center. The vast majority of its yield derived from fission. The energy output from the thermonuclear fusion in this test was insignificant in comparison. The \\"George\\" device was more like a \\"boosted\\" nuclear bomb than a thermonuclear one. The small amount of heavy deuterium and tritium in this test fused, but its role was to generate a strong flurry of fast neutrons - ones that sparked more fissions in the uranium nuclei that were present, and which also caused fission in uranium-238 - which does not fission under bombardment with slow neutrons, as does uranium-235. The George design was a 'Classical Super' prototype with a binary triggering device using radiation implosion upon a cylinder. The design of the triggering system in this test was based on the one patented by Klaus Fuchs and von Neumann in 1946. Its success played a vital role in the history of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design. The George test validated the principles which would be used for the first full-scale thermonuclear bomb test, Ivy Mike, one year later, on November 1, 1952, at Enewetak Atoll. Item Conducted on May 25, 1951, Item was the first test of an actual boosted fission weapon, nearly doubling the normal yield of a similar non-boosted weapon. In this test, deuterium-tritium (D-T) gas was injected into the enriched uranium core of a nuclear fission bomb. The extreme heat of the fissioning bomb produced thermonuclear fusion reactions within the D-T gas. While not enough to be considered a full nuclear fusion bomb, the large number of high-energy neutrons released nearly doubled the efficiency of the nuclear fission reaction. Dog The Dog explosion is more popularly known for an image taken of those viewing it than the actual explosion itself; the photograph depicts numerous VIPs wearing safety goggles sitting on Adirondack chairs while being illuminated by the flash of the detonation. This photograph takes up the bottom portion of the cover of the 1995 documentary Trinity and Beyond by Peter Kuran. The safety goggles worn by all those viewing the test in the picture have become somewhat of a museum collectors item, with a possibility that Norman F. Ramsey may have been present. Cynthia Miller claims that her father, Van Dine, is the first man on the left in the photo. The blast wave safely arrived at the location of the VIPs some 45 seconds after the initially silent flash of the detonation as observed from their position on Parry island.

Upshot‚ÄìKnothole Grable test (film) The test series was notable as containing the first time an AFAP shell was fired (GRABLE Shot), the first two shots (both fizzles) by University of California Radiation Laboratory‚ÄîLivermore (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and for testing out some of the thermonuclear components that would be used for the massive thermonuclear series of Operation Castle. One primary device (RACER) was tested in thermonuclear system mockup assemblies of TX-14, TX-16, and TX-17/TX-24, to examine and evaluate the behaviour of radiation cases and the compression of the secondary geometries by the primary's x-rays prior to full-scale testing during Castle. Following RACER's dodgy performance, the COBRA primary was used in the emergency capability ALARM CLOCK, JUGHEAD, RUNT I, RUNT II thermonuclear devices, as well as in the SHRIMP device.

The mountain was named in 1904 after John Niblock, a superintendent with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Niblock was an early promoter of tourism in the Rockies and influenced the naming of some of the CPR stops in Western Canada. Mt. Niblock is a popular scramble in the Lake Louise area and is sometimes combined in the same day with Mount Whyte (), although the latter is a more difficult scramble. The best time for climbing Mt. Niblock is July through September when the normal route is usually free of snow. Attempting it in the spring or early summer may include significant avalanche hazard. To access Mt. Niblock, follow the trail as it begins near Chateau Lake Louise, passes Mirror Lake and then Lake Agnes. Follow the right hand shore line trail to the far end of the lake until it begins its left turn towards the Big Beehive. Here an obvious path can be found leading to the lower scree slopes and short cliffs. A more detailed route description can be found in Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies. Mount Niblock reflected in Lake Herbert Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Niblock is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, this mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

Use in construction Putty has been used extensively in glazing for fixing and sealing panes of glass into wooden frames (or sashes), although its use is decreasing with the prevalence of PVC and metal window frames which use synthetic sealants such as silicone. Glazing putty is traditionally made by mixing a base of whiting (finely ground chalk) with linseed oil in various proportions. There are a number of synthetic alternatives such as polybutene based putties, where the polybutene is a low molecular weight oligomer replacing the linseed oil. Butyl rubber is also added to the mixture to provide some strength and flexibility. Painter's Putty is typically a linseed oil-based product used for filling holes, minor cracks and defacements in wood only. Putties can also be made intumescent, in which case they are used for firestopping as well as for padding of electrical outlet boxes in fire-resistance rated drywall assemblies. In the latter case, hydrates in the putty produce an endothermic reaction to mitigate heat transfer to the unexposed side. In woodworking, water-based putties are more commonly used, as these emit very little odour, are more easily cleaned up and are compatible with water-based and latex sealers. Plumber's putty is waterproof, used to make watertight seals in plumbing. Pratley Putty is an adhesive used primarily for steel bonding. Other uses Certain types of putty also have use in the field of terminal ballistics, where the putty can accurately represent the average density of the human body. As such it can be used, for instance, to test the penetrative power of projectiles, or the stopping power of body armour.

Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard Page 272 (1990) Hellenistic Jewish historian whose work survives only in five fragments (or possibly six fragments) in Eusebius of Caesarea's Praeparatio Evangelica (hereafter abbreviated as Praep.), embedded in quotations from the historian Alexander Polyhistor, and in the Stromata (hereafter abbreviated as Strom.) of Clement of Alexandria. A sixth passage which Polyhistor attributes to Eupolemus in Eusebius' quotations of Polyhistor is usually considered spurious as being dissimilar to the other passages quoted and has come to be called Pseudo-Eupolemus. Style and vocabulary indicate the writing as also originally in Greek and the date of composition of the seemingly genuine passages is about 158/7 BC. That the author dates his work by the Seleucids rather than the Ptolemies suggests Palestinian rather than Egyptian origin. It has been speculated that the author might be the Eupolemus who was ambassador of Judas Maccabeus to Rome as found in 1 Maccabees 8.17f and 2 Maccabees 4.11.Martin McNamara writes: \\"The writer is probably to be identified with Eupolemus, the son of John, the son of Accos, who according to 1 Macc 8:17 and 2 Macc 4:11 was sent together with Jason son of Eleazar on an embassy to Rome in 161 B.C. to negotiate a treaty between the resurgent Hasmoneans and the Roman Republic. Evidently Eupolemus was a friend of the Jewish ruler Judas Maccabee and a gifted diplomat as well, since he succeeded in his mission. He may have been a priest since he speaks at length in his writing of Solomon's temple. He composed his work in the year 158/157 B.C.\\" (page 222 of Intertestamental Literature, Martin McNamara, Glazier (Michael) Inc., U.S.; New Ed edition, Feb 1991, ). Writings The fragments usually considered Eupolemus' genuine work are: * A statement that Moses was the first wise man, that he taught the alphabet to the Jews who passed it on to the Phoenicians who passed it on to the Greeks, and that Moses first wrote laws for the Jews (Praep. 9.26.1). * Some chronology about the period from Moses to David and some details of David's arrangements for building the temple followed by purported transcripts of letters exchanged between King Solomon and \\"Vaphres King of Egypt\\" and between Solomon and \\"Souron the King of Tyre\\", the Biblical Hiram (Praep. 9.30.1-34.18). * A short statement about gold shields made by Solomon (Praep. 9.34.20). * A very short account of the persecution of the prophet Jeremiah by King \\"Jonachim\\" who seems to correspond to the Biblical kings Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah followed by a short fictionalized account of the fall of Judah ending with the note that Jeremiah preserved the ark and the tablets (Praep. 9.39.2-5). * A chronological summary indicating 5,149 years from Adam to the 5th year of Demetrius (Strom. 1.141,4). Writing of Pseudo-Eupolemus The fragment usually known as Pseudo-Eupolemus (Praep. 9.17.2-9) relates: * The Assyrian city of Babylon [sic] was built by giants who escaped the Flood and they also built the tower. After its destruction the giants were scattered. * There follows a summary of Abraham's career based on the Biblical account with some changes and details similar to those found in the Genesis Apocryphon and Josephus and in Enochite tradition. Abraham is particularly knowledgeable about astronomy and when he goes down to Egypt he teaches astrology to the Egyptian priests and explains that Enoch first discovered astrology. * Then follows a puzzling passage which seems to have little to do with the context and may be garbled: ::For the Babylonians say that the first was Belus, who is the same as Cronus, and that of him were born sons named Belus and Canaan. This Canaan fathered the father of the Phoenicians, whose son was Chum/Chus, called by the Greeks Asbolus and was the father of the Ethiopians and the brother of Mestraim, the ancestor of the Egyptians. :Traditionally many translators have emended Canaan to Cham, that is Ham since in Genesis 10.6 Ham is the father of Cush and Mizraim. However the author here claims to be relating Babylonian tradition, not Hebrew tradition, for whatever that is worth. Asbolus means 'sooty'. :R. Doran in his translation in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Volume 2, emends einai Kronon 'is the same as Cronus' to einai Kronou 'is son of Cronus' noting that in no other text is anyone called Belus ever equated with Cronus. However, in Sanchuniathon's Historie, we find the gods Cronus & Elus in the same place on the genealogical tree, even though Elus is equated to El in this case. * The account concludes by indicating that the Greeks relate that Atlas discovered astrology but that Atlas is really Enoch and that Enoch learned from the angels of God. R. Doran gives reason for believing that this fragment may be part of the genuine work of Eupolemus despite earlier doubts.Cf also ≈Åukasz Niesio≈Çowski-Spano, (Pseudo-)Eupolemus and Shechem: Methodology Enabling the Use of Hellenistic Jewish Historians' Work in Biblical Studies, in: Lester L.

The mountain can be seen from the Trans-Canada Highway, and offers views of the Valley of the Ten Peaks, including the Chateau Lake Louise. The mountain was named in 1898 by Sir William Methuen after William Whyte, a representative of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Climbing Mt. Whyte is usually combined with Mount Niblock () when done as a scramble. However, while Mt. Niblock is rated a moderate scramble, Mt. Whyte is much more difficult due to additional exposure and loose rock. The scramble should not be attempted in snowy conditions due to considerable fall distance which would likely prove fatal. For rock climbers, the Perren Route (II 5.6) is another option. While mostly a scramble as well, a short section of difficult climbing near the top in addition to route finding challenges and loose rock will not make it an easy ascent. Further reading ‚Ä¢ M.

Pareidolia can be considered a subcategory of apophenia. Common examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, the Man in the Moon, the Moon rabbit, and other lunar pareidolia. The concept of pareidolia may extend to include hidden messages in recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing indistinct voices in random noise such as that produced by air conditioners or fans. Pareidolia was at one time considered a symptom of human psychosis, but it is now seen as a normal human tendency. Rosen, Rebecca J. \\"Pareidolia: A Bizarre Bug of the Human Mind Emerges in Computers\\". The Atlantic. August 7, 2012. Pareidolia is not confined to humans. Scientists have for years taught computers to use visual clues to \\"see\\" faces and other images.  Etymology  The word derives from the Greek words para (œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨, \\"beside, alongside, instead [of]\\") and the noun eid≈çlon (Œµ·º¥Œ¥œâŒªŒøŒΩ \\"image, form, shape\\"). The German word \\"Pareidolie\\" was used in articles by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum ‚Äî for example in his 1866 paper \\"Die Sinnesdelierien\\" (\\"On Delusion of the Senses\\"). When Kahlbaum's paper was reviewed the following year (1867) in The Journal of Mental Science, Volume 13, \\"Pareidolie\\" was translated as pareidolia: \\"‚Ä¶partial hallucination, perception of secondary images, or pareidolia.\\" Sibbald, M.D. \\"Report on the Progress of Psychological Medicine; German Psychological Literature\\", The Journal of Mental Science, Volume 13. 1867. p. 238  Explanations  A simple collection of lines may be quickly perceived as a face, and even be interpreted as expressing a particular emotion Pareidolia can cause people to interpret random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects. These studies help to explain why people identify a few lines and a circle as a \\"face\\" so quickly and without hesitation. Cognitive processes are activated by the \\"face-like\\" object, which alert the observer to both the emotional state and identity of the subject, even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information. A \\"stick figure face\\", despite its simplicity, can convey mood information, and be drawn to indicate emotions such as happiness or anger. This robust and subtle capability is hypothesized to be the result of eons of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state, for example, of threatening people, thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack pre-emptively. In other words, processing this information subcortically ‚Äì therefore subconsciously ‚Äì before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed. This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and recognition of human emotions, also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife. Pareidolia can be considered a subcategory of apophenia.  Mimetoliths  Satellite photograph of a mesa in the Cydonia region of Mars, often called the \\"Face on Mars\\" and cited as evidence of extraterrestrial habitation. A more detailed photograph taken in different lighting in 2001 shows how it is a natural rock formation. A mimetolithic pattern is a pattern created by rocks that may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation, weathering and erosion. Picture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns such as banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), or dendritic or color variations, resulting in what appear to be miniature scenes on a cut section, which is then used for jewelry. More often, the size scale of the rock is larger than the object it resembles, such as a cliff profile resembling a human face. Well-meaning people with a new interest in fossils can pick up chert nodules, concretions or pebbles resembling bones, skulls, turtle shells, dinosaur eggs, etc., in both size and shape. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese researcher Chonosuke Okamura self-published a series of reports titled Original Report of the Okamura Fossil Laboratory, in which he described tiny inclusions in polished limestone from the Silurian period (425 mya) as being preserved fossil remains of tiny humans, gorillas, dogs, dragons, dinosaurs and other organisms, all of them only millimeters long, leading him to claim, \\"There have been no changes in the bodies of mankind since the Silurian period... except for a growth in stature from 3.5 mm to 1,700 mm.\\" archived at Improbable Research. Okamura's research earned him an Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prizes) in biodiversity in 1996. Some sources describe various mimeolithic features exist on Pluto, including a heart-shaped region.  Projective tests  The Rorschach inkblot test uses pareidolia in an attempt to gain insight into a person's mental state. The Rorschach is a projective test, as it intentionally elicits the thoughts or feelings of respondents that are \\"projected\\" onto the ambiguous inkblot images.  Literature and art  Renaissance artists and authors have shown a particular interest in pareidolia. In William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, for example, the character Hamlet points at the sky and \\"demonstrates\\" his supposed madness in this exchange with Polonius: > HAMLET :Do you see yonder cloud that‚Äôs almost in the shape of a camel? > POLONIUS :By th‚ÄôMass and ‚Äôtis, like a camel indeed. HAMLET :Methinks it is a > weasel. POLONIUS :It is backed like a weasel. HAMLET :Or a whale. POLONIUS > :Very like a whale.Shakespeare, William. Hamlet. 3.3.367-73Raber, Karen. > Shakespeare and Posthumanist Theory. Arden Shakespeare (2018) pp. 80-1 Graphic artists have often used pareidolia in paintings and drawings: Andrea Mantegna, Leonardo Da Vinci, Giotto, Hans Holbein, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, and many more have shown images‚Äîoften human faces‚Äîthat due to pareidolia appear in objects or clouds.Raber, Karen. Shakespeare and Posthumanist Theory. Arden Shakespeare (2018) pp. 81-2 The Jurist by Giuseppe Arcimboldo, 1566. What appears to be his face is a collection of fish and poultry. In his notebooks, Leonardo da Vinci wrote of pareidolia as a device for painters, writing: Architecture Two 13th-century edifices in Turkey display architectural use of shadows of stone carvings at the entrance. Outright pictures are avoided in Islam but tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, so designed \\"accidental\\" silhouettes of carved stone tessellations became a creative escape. *Niƒüde Alaaddin Mosque, Niƒüde, Turkey (1223) with its \\"mukarnas\\" art where the shadows of three-dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance form a chiaroscuro drawing of a woman's face with a crown and long hair appearing at a specific time, at some specific days of the year. *Divriƒüi Great Mosque and Hospital in Sivas, Turkey (1229) shows shadows of the 3 dimensional ornaments of both entrances of the mosque part, to cast a giant shadow of a praying man that changes pose as the sun moves, as if to illustrate what the purpose of the building is. Another detail is the difference in the impressions of the clothing of the two shadow-men indicating two different styles, possibly to tell who is to enter through which door.  Religious  There have been many instances of perceptions of religious imagery and themes, especially the faces of religious figures, in ordinary phenomena. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, the word Allah, or other religious phenomena: in September 2007 in Singapore, for example, a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers to pay homage to the \\"Monkey god\\" (either Sun Wukong or Hanuman) in the monkey tree phenomenon. Publicity surrounding sightings of religious figures and other surprising images in ordinary objects has spawned a market for such items on online auctions like eBay. One famous instance was a grilled cheese sandwich with the face of the Virgin Mary. During the September 11 attacks, television viewers supposedly saw the face of Satan in clouds of smoke billowing out of the World Trade Center after it was struck by the airplane. Another example of face recognition pareidolia originated in the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, when a few observers claimed to see Jesus in the flames. Mars canals Map of Martian \\"canals\\" by Percival Lowell A notable example of pareidolia occurred in 1877, when observers using telescopes to view the surface of Mars thought that they saw faint straight lines, which were then interpreted by some as canals (see Martian canal). It was theorized that the canals were possibly created by sentient beings. This created a sensation. In the next few years better photographic techniques and stronger telescopes were developed and applied, which resulted in new images in which the faint lines disappeared, and the canal theory was debunked as an example of pareidolia.

Computer vision  Given an image of jellyfish swimming, the DeepDream program can be encouraged to \\"see\\" dogs Pareidolia can occur in computer vision,Chalup, Stephan K., Kenny Hong, and Michael J.

In the case of an artificial neural network, higher-level features correspond to more recognizable features, and enhancing these features brings out what the computer sees. These examples of pareidolia reflect the training set of images that the network has \\"seen\\" previously. Striking visuals can be produced in this way, notably in the DeepDream software, which falsely detects and then exaggerates features such as eyes and faces in any image.  Speech  In 1971 Konstantƒ´ns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, detailing what he believed was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP has been described as auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.  Related phenomena  A shadow person (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is often attributed to pareidolia. It is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity. Pareidolia is also what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have seen ghosts.

He did not wear clothing either in summer or winter. Fools for Christ often challenge accepted norms to serve a religious purpose. Foolishness for Christ (, ) refers to behavior such as giving up all one's worldly possessions upon joining a monastic order, or deliberately flouting society's conventions to serve a religious purpose‚Äîparticularly of Christianity. Such individuals have historically been known as both \\"holy fools\\" and \\"blessed fools\\". The term \\"fool\\" connotes what is perceived as feeblemindedness, and \\"blessed\\" or \\"holy\\" refers to innocence in the eyes of God.Frith, Uta. (1989) Autism: The Elegant Enigma. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing. The term fools for Christ derives from the writings of Saint Paul. Desert Fathers and other saints acted the part of Holy Fools, as have the yurodivy (or iurodstvo) of Eastern Orthodox asceticism. Fools for Christ often employ shocking and unconventional behavior to challenge accepted norms, deliver prophecies, or to mask their piety.Parry (1999), p. 233 Parallels for this type of behavior exist in non-Christian traditions as well. The Avadhuta (Sanskrit), for example, the Islamic tradition of Qalandariyya and Malamatiyya Sufism and other crazy-wise mystics display similar traits. Nasreddin, of the Sufis, is also an example.  Old Testament  Certain prophets of the Old Testament who exhibited signs of strange behaviour are considered by some scholarsGorainoff I. Les Fols en Christ... –†. 15‚Äì16; Saward J. Dieu a la folie. P. 15. to be predecessors of \\"Fools for Christ\\". The prophet Isaiah walked naked and barefoot for about three years, predicting a forthcoming captivity in Egypt ; the prophet Ezekiel lay before a stone, which symbolized beleaguered Jerusalem, and though God instructed him to eat bread baked on human waste, ultimately he asked to use cow dung instead ; Hosea married a harlot to symbolize the infidelity of Israel before God . By the opinion of certain scholars,J.- C. Larchee. Healing of mental illnesses: The experience of first centuries in the christian East. Translated from French into Russian. Moscow. Publishing House of Sretensky Monastery, 2007. 224 pages. these prophets were not counted as fools by their contemporaries, as they just carried out separate actions to attract people's attention and to awake their repentance.  New Testament  A God¬¥s Fool Sitting On the Snow, by Vasily Surikov, 1885 According to Christian ideas, \\"foolishness\\" included consistent rejection of worldly cares and imitating Christ, who endured mockery and humiliation from the crowd. The spiritual meaning of \\"foolishness\\" from the early ages of Christianity was close to unacceptance of common social rules of hypocrisy, brutality and thirst for power and gains. By the words of Anthony the Great: \\"Here comes the time, when people will behave like madmen, and if they see anybody who does not behave like that, they will rebel against him and say: 'You are mad', ‚Äî because he is not like them.\\"Apophtegmy (Alphavitnoye sobranie). About Avva Anthony. 25 (in Russian: Memorable stories.) p. 427. Paul the Apostle Part of the Biblical basis for it can be seen in the words of the Apostle Paul in , which famously says: :\\"We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.\\" (KJV). And also: :\\"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: \\"He catches the wise in their craftiness.\\" () :\\"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.\\" () :\\"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.\\" ()  Western Christianity  Benedict Joseph Labre The most famous example in the Western church is St. Francis of Assisi, whose order was known for following the teachings of Christ and walking in his footsteps. Thus, upon joining the order, Franciscans gave away all possessions and focused on preaching in the streets to the common man. Saint Juniper, an early follower of the Franciscan order, was known for taking the doctrine of the Franciscans to the extreme. Whenever anyone asked for any of his possessions, he freely gave them away, including his clothes. He once even cut off the bells from his altar-cloth and gave them to a poor woman.Frith, Uta. (1989) Autism: Explaining the Enigma. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing. His fellow Franciscans had to watch him closely, and strictly forbade him from giving away his clothes. While such behaviors were embarrassing to his brothers, he was also recognized as a pure example of the Franciscan order and thus esteemed. \\"The Little Flowers of Saint Francis of Assisi\\",Hudleston, Dom R. (1953) The Little Flowers of Saint Francis of Assissi\\", 1st English translation, revised and amended. London: Burns & Oates. which documents the oral traditions of the Franciscans, told several stories of \\"Brother Juniper\\". The most famous of these is the story of how Brother Juniper cut off the foot of a pig to give it to a sick brother. Upon the sick brother's request for a pig's foot, Brother Juniper took a kitchen knife and ran into the forest, where he saw a herd of swine feeding. There, he quickly cut the foot off of one of the swine and carried it back to the brother, leaving the swine to die. This angered the herdsman, who complained to Saint Francis. Saint Francis confronted Brother Juniper, who joyfully exclaimed, \\"It is true, sweet father, that I did cut off the swine's foot. I will tell thee the reason. I went out of charity to visit the brother who is sick.\\" Brother Juniper likewise explained to the angry herdsman who, seeing the \\"charity, simplicity, and humility\\" (Hudleston, 1953) in Brother Juniper's heart, forgave him and delivered the rest of the pig to the brothers.  Eastern Christianity  The Holy Fool or yur√≥divyy (—é—Ä–æ–¥–∏–≤—ã–π) is the Russian version of foolishness for Christ, a peculiar form of Eastern Orthodox asceticism. The yurodivy is a Holy Fool, one who acts intentionally foolish in the eyes of men. The term implies behaviour \\"which is caused neither by mistake nor by feeble-mindedness, but is deliberate, irritating, even provocative.\\"Ivanov, S. A. (2006) \\"Holy Fools in Byzantium and Beyond.\\" Oxford: Oxford University Press. In his book Holy Fools in Byzantium and Beyond, Ivanov described \\"holy fool\\" as a term for a person who \\"feigns insanity, pretends to be silly, or who provokes shock or outrage by his deliberate unruliness.\\" He explained that such conduct qualifies as holy foolery only if the audience believes that the individual is sane, moral, and pious. The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that holy fools voluntarily take up the guise of insanity in order to conceal their perfection from the world, and thus avoid praise. Some characteristics that were commonly seen in holy fools were going around half-naked, being homeless, speaking in riddles, being believed to be clairvoyant and a prophet, and occasionally being disruptive and challenging to the point of seeming immoral (though always to make a point). Ivanov argued that, unlike in the past, modern yurodivy are generally aware that they look pathetic in others‚Äô eyes. They strive to pre-empt this contempt through exaggerated self- humiliation, and following such displays they let it be known both that their behaviors were staged and that their purpose was to disguise their superiority over their audience. Fools for Christ are often given the title of Blessed (–±–ª–∞–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π), which does not necessarily mean that the individual is less than a saint, but rather points to the blessings from God that they are believed to have acquired. The Soul of the People. Notice the old man in the background, with his arms stretched to heaven, painting by Mikhail Nesterov The Eastern Orthodox Church records Isidora Barankis of Egypt (d. 369) among the first Holy Fools. However, the term was not popularized until the coming of Symeon of Emesa, who is considered to be a patron saint of holy fools.Holy Foolishness, by the Rev. Frank Logue, King of Peace Episcopal Church, Kingsland, Georgia, February 2002 In Greek, the term for Holy Fool is salos. The practice was recognised in the hagiography of fifth-century Byzantium, and it was extensively adopted in Muscovite Russia, probably in the 14th century. The madness of the Holy Fool was ambiguous, and could be real or simulated. He (or she) was believed to have been divinely inspired, and was therefore able to say truths which others could not, normally in the form of indirect allusions or parables. He had a particular status in regard to the Tsars, as a figure not subject to earthly control or judgement. Holy Rus, by Mikhail Nesterov The first reported fool-for-Christ in Russia was St. Procopius (Prokopiy), who came from the lands of the Holy Roman Empire to Novgorod, then moved to Ustyug, pretending to be a fool and leading an ascetic way of life (slept naked on church-porches, prayed throughout the whole night, received food only from poor people). He was abused and beaten, but finally won respect and became venerated after his death. The Russian Orthodox Church numbers 36 yurodivye among its saints, starting from Procopius of Ustyug, and most prominently Basil Fool for Christ, who gives his name to Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. One of the best-known modern examples in the Russian Church is perhaps St Xenia of Saint Petersburg.  Common phrases or epithets  A God's Fool, by Pavel Svedomsky Crazy for God  \\"Crazy for God\\" is an expression sometimes used in the United States and other English speaking countries to convey a similar idea to \\"Foolishness for Christ.\\" It has been especially connected to the Unification Church of the United States. In The Way of God's Will, a collection of sayings popular among church members, Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon is quoted as saying: \\"We leaders should leave the tradition that we have become crazy for God.\\" In 1979 Unification Church critic Christopher Edwards titled a memoir about his experiences in the six months he spent as a church member: Crazy for God: The nightmare of cult life. In 2007, author Frank Schaeffer titled his autobiography Crazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right, and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back. It tells of his upbringing as the son of a well-known evangelical minister and his later conversion to the Greek Orthodox Church. In the same year Stephen Prothero, author and chairman of Boston University's Department of Religion, wrote in the Harvard Divinity Bulletin: \\"I am crazy for people who are crazy for God: people nearly as inscrutable to me as divinity, who leave wives and children to become forest-dwelling monks in Thailand, who wander naked across the belly of India in search of self-realization, who speak in tongues and take up serpents in Appalachia because the Bible says they can.\\"Belief Ubracketed: A Case for the Religion Scholar to Reveal More of Where He or She Is Coming From , Harvard Divinity Bulletin, November 6, 2007  On fire for God  \\"On fire for God\\" is an expression often used in respect of persons who are engaged in serving God in such a way that their activities reflect a 'burning' desire to fulfil their calling. This often manifests itself in what might be regarded as burning passion, such as evangelising (preaching) on the streets. Modern theology One of the more recent works in theology is Fools for Christ by Jaroslav Pelikan. Through six essays dealing with various \\"fools,\\" Pelikan explores the motif of fool-for-Christ in relationship to the problem of understanding the numinous: > The Holy is too great and too terrible when encountered directly for men of > normal sanity to be able to contemplate it comfortably. Only those who > cannot care for the consequences run the risk of the direct confrontation of > the Holy.  The yurodivy in art and literature  There are a number of references to the yurodivy in 19th century Russian literature. The holy fool Nikolka is a character in Pushkin's play Boris Godunov and Mussorgsky's opera based on the play. In Pushkin's narrative poem The Bronze Horseman, the character of Evgenii is based in the tradition of the holy fools in his confrontation with the animated statue of Peter the Great. The yurodivy appears several times in the novels of Dostoevsky. The Idiot explores the ramifications of placing a holy fool (the compassionate and insightful epileptic Prince Myshkin) in a secular world dominated by vanity and desire. According to Joseph Frank \\"though the gentlemanly and well-educated prince bears no external resemblance to these eccentric figures, he does possess their traditional gift of spiritual insight, which operates instinctively, below any level of conscious awareness or doctrinal commitment.\\" In Demons, the madwoman Marya Lebyadkina displays many of the attributes of the holy fool, as do the characters of Sofya Marmeladova in Crime and Punishment and Lizaveta in Brothers Karamazov. Another fool-for-Christ is Grisha in Tolstoy's Childhood. Boyhood. Youth. Callis and Dewey described Grisha as follows: :He was an awesome figure: emaciated, barefoot and in rags, with eyes that \\"looked right through you\\" and long, shaggy hair. He always wore chains around his neck...Neighborhood children would sometimes run after him, laughing and calling out his name. Older persons, as a rule, viewed Grisha with respect and a little fear, especially when he suffered one of his periodic seizures and began to shout and rant. At such times adult bystanders would crowd around and listen, for they believed that the Holy Spirit was working through him.Birukoff, Paul & Tolstoy, Leo. (1911) ‚ÄúLeo Tolstoy: His Life and Work.‚Äù New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons. Grisha's abnormal social conduct, seizures, and rants were common behaviors amongst holy fools. The esteem expressed by adults was also common. In his autobiography, Tolstoy expressed such esteem in reaction to overhearing Grisha praying: :‚ÄúOh Great Christian Grisha! Your faith was so strong that you felt the nearness of God; your love was so great that words flowed of their own will from your lips, and you did not verify them by reason. And what high praise you gave to the majesty of God, when, not finding any words, you prostrated yourself on the ground.‚Äù  Film references  *The Island (also known as Ostrov), a 2006 movie telling the life story of (fictional) Father Anatoly in 1970s Russia. *The Ostern Miles of Fire. *The character Kayom in At Home Among Strangers, who quickly turns from foe to friend, can be seen as such a figure. *In the film Andrei Rublev, a jurodivyj character, \\"Durochka\\" (en. little fool girl) is played by director Andrei Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush. *The Stalker from the film Stalker, by Tarkovsky, can also be identified as a holy fool.

The other two arms established by Rabbi Wise are the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and the Central Conference of American Rabbis. The current president of the URJ is Rabbi Richard Jacobs. The URJ has an estimated constituency of some 880,000 registered adults in 873 congregations. It claims to represent 2.2 million, as over a third of adult U.S. Jews, including many who are not synagogue members, state affinity with Reform, making it the largest Jewish denomination. The UAHC was a founding member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, of which the URJ is the largest constituent by far. Belief and practice Reform Judaism, also known as Liberal or Progressive Judaism, embraces several basic tenets, including a belief in a theistic, personal God; continuous revelation, with the view that scripture was written by divinely inspired humans. The Reform movement upholds the autonomy of the individual to form their own Jewish beliefs, and to be the final arbiter of their own spiritual practices. At the same time, Reform Judaism stresses Jewish learning in order to gain insights into the tradition and make informed choices. The Reform movement also encourages its members to participate in synagogue and communal Jewish life. Reform Judaism draws a distinction between the moral and ethical imperatives of Judaism and traditional ritual requirements and practices, which, it believes may be altered or renewed to better fulfill Judaism's higher function. Another central tenet of Reform Judaism is the belief that it is the universal mission of Jews to spread God's message, to be a light unto the nations. Reform Judaism foresees a future Messianic Age of peace, but without the coming of an individual Messiah or the restoration of the Third Temple and sacrificial cult in Jerusalem. Reform Judaism rejects the notion of bodily resurrection of the dead at the end of days, while affirming, at most, immortality of the soul. During its \\"Classical\\" era, roughly between the Civil War and the 1930s, American Reform rejected many ceremonial aspects of Judaism and the authority of traditional jurisprudence (halakhah), favoring a more rationalistic, universalist view of religious life. \\"New Reform\\", from the 1937 Columbus Declaration of Principles and onwards, sought to reincorporate such elements and emphasize Jewish particularism, though still subject to personal autonomy. Concurrently, the denomination prioritized inclusiveness and diversification. This became especially pronounced after the adoption of \\"Big Tent Judaism\\" policy in the 1970s. Old ritual items became fashionable again, as were ceremonies, such as ablution. The liturgy, once abridged and containing much English, had more Hebrew and traditional formulae restored, though not due to theological concerns. In contrast with \\"Classical\\", \\"New Reform\\" abandoned the drive to equate religious expression with one's actual belief. Confirmation ceremonies in which the young were examined to prove knowledge in the faith, once ubiquitous, were mostly replaced by Bar and Bat Mitzvah, yet many adolescents still undergo Confirmation (often at the Feast of Weeks) between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. A unique aspect of Reform was its interpretation to the old rabbinic concept of Tikkun Olam (Repair of the World); it became a rallying cry for participation in various initiatives pursuing social justice and other progressive agendas, like the Civil Rights Movement, women's equality and gay rights. Another key aspect of American Reform, which it shares with sister movements in the WUPJ, is its approach to Jewish identity. Interfaith marriage, once a taboo ‚Äì the CCAR penalized any involvement by its clergy in such ceremonies by ordinances passed in 1909, 1947 and 1962 ‚Äì were becoming more prevalent toward the end of the 20th Century. In 1979, the URJ adopted a policy of embracing the intermarried and their spouses, in the hope the latter would convert. In 1983 it recognized Judaism based on patrilineal descent, affirming that offspring of a single Jewish parent (whether father or mother) would be accepted as inheriting his status if they would demonstrate affinity to the faith. Children of a Jewish mother who will not commit to Judaism were not to be considered Jewish. These measures made Reform the most hospitable to non-Jewish family members among major American denominations: in 2006, 17% of synagogue-member households had a converted spouse, and 26% and unconverted one. These policies also raised great tensions with the more traditional movements. Orthodox and Conservatives rejected the validity of Reform conversions already before that, though among the latter, the greater proclivity of CCAR rabbis to perform the process under halachic standards allowed for many such to be approved. Patrilineal descent caused a growing percentage of Reform constituency to be regarded as non-Jewish by the two other denominations. Organizational structure The URJ, which was named the \\"Union of American Hebrew Congregations\\" until 7 November 2003, incorporates 846 congregations in the United States and 27 in Canada. The Union consists of four administrative districts, West, East, South and Central, which in turn are divided into a total of 35 regional communities, comprising groups of local congregations; 34 are in the United States and one represents all those affiliated with the Canadian Council for Reform Judaism. The URJ is led by a board of trustees, consisting 253 lay members. This board is overseen by the 5,000-member General Assembly, which convenes biennially. It was first assembled in Cleveland on 14 July 1874, and the most recent biennial was held in Boston on 5‚Äì10 December 2017.http://www.cvent.com/events/urj- biennial-2017/agenda-787082dfce8940c9a72f2246c5208ab9.aspx The board directs the Senior Leadership Team, headed by the URJ President. Spiritual guidance is provided by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which has some 2,300 clergy members who convene annually. Most CCAR members have been trained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the Reform movement's seminary. The CCAR has a publishing arm and oversees various committees, such as those focusing on Ritual, Responsa,and Prayerbooks. Synagogue prayers are conducted mainly by members of the CCAR and of the American Conference of Cantors. The political and legislative outreach of the URJ is performed by the Religious Action Center based in Washington D.C. The RAC advocates policy positions based upon religious values, and is associated with political progressivism, as part of the vision for Tikkun Olam. The denomination is also supported by the Women of Reform Judaism (formerly, the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods). The URJ has an estimated constituency of 850,000 in the United States, 760,000 Jews and further 90,000 non-converted gentile spouses. A greater number identifies with Reform Judaism without affiliating with a synagogue. The 2013 Pew survey assessed that 35% of Jews in the United States consider themselves Reform (the 2001 AJC poll cited 38%); based on these figures, Steven M. Cohen estimated there were 1,154,000 identifying non-member adults in addition to those registered, not including children.Steven M. Cohen, Members and Motives: Who Joins American Jewish Congregations and Why , S3K Report, Fall 2006; As Reform Jews Gather, Some Good News in the Numbers, Jewish Daily Forward, 5 November 2015. There are further 30,000 affiliated congregants in Canada. Citing those findings, the URJ claims to represent a total of 2.2 million individuals.\\"Nearly 2.2 million Americans and Canadians identify as Reform Jews\\": The Reform Movement, urj.org. Youth group & summer camps  Entrance sign for Camp Swig in Saratoga, California. NFTY: The Reform Jewish Youth Movement exists to supplement and support Reform youth groups at the synagogue level. About 750 local youth groups affiliate themselves with the organization, comprising over 8,500 youth members. The URJ Camp & Israel Programs is the largest Jewish camping system in the world, comprising 15 summer camps across North America, including specialty camps in science & technology, creative arts, and sports and programs for youth with special needs. Many of the camps have long provided the opportunity for high school pupils to travel to Israel through NFTY in Israel during the summer. The Union offers various Israel programs for seminarians and students. Including a youth convention every other year. History Reform-like ideas in the United States were first expressed by the Reformed Society of Israelites, founded in Charleston, South Carolina on 21 November 1824. It was led by Isaac Harby, Abraham Moise, and David Nunes Carvalho, who represented the younger, Americanized, and religiously lax generation in the Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim. Standing in opposition to a more stringent establishment, formed from English-born immigrants, Harby and his followers were mainly concerned with decorum. They demanded English-language sermons, synagogue affairs handled in English rather than Early Modern Spanish (as was prevalent among Western Sephardim), and so forth. However, they also arrived at more principled issues. On their first anniversary, Harby delivered an oratory in which he declared Rabbinic Judaism a demented faith, no longer relevant, and that America was \\"the Promised Land of Scripture.\\" They fully seceded by their second anniversary, after continued rebuffs on the part of the wardens, forming their own prayer group. The three leaders authored a prayerbook in which they completely excised any mention of the Messiah, restoration of sacrifices, and return to Zion. It was published in 1830. Far more moderate alterations along these lines, in the first liturgy considered Reformed, caused an uproar at Hamburg in 1818. The Society, numbering several dozens, dissipated and merged back into Beth Elohim during 1833, but they did not cease being a factor. In 1836, the reunified congregation hired Gustavus Poznanski as cantor. He spent time in Hamburg and knew the rite of the Hamburg Temple. Traditional at first, Poznanski soon followed a different course. In 1843 he attempted to abolish the Second Day of Festivals and later published his own version of the Maimonedes' Creed, which lacked reference to Resurrection of the Dead and the Messiah. He also instituted various ritual reforms. Supported by many of the former secessionists, he eventually resigned in 1847. A year before that, Isaac Mayer Wise arrived from Europe. In a country where Jewish immigrants lacked an organized and established religious leadership, Wise quickly rose to prominence. While far from traditional belief, he was disinterested in offering a comprehensive new approach, focusing on pragmatic compromises. Wise introduced family pews for the first time in known synagogue history (by random, when his congregation bought a church) in Albany on Shabbat Shuvah, 3 October 1851. His attempts to forge a single American Judaism motivated him to seek agreement with the conservative Isaac Leeser. Relations between them, wrought with suspicion from the beginning, were terminated after Wise agreed to Leeser's demands in the 1855 Cleveland Synod and then retracted when the latter left. Wise was soon outflanked by the radical Reform rabbi David Einhorn, who espoused a dogmatic, rigid line demanding conformity with the principles of Reform Judaism then formulated in Germany. Many other German rabbis crossed the ocean to the land where their religious outlook, free from state intervention or communal pressures, could be expressed purely. Einhorn gradually gained the upper hand, though the conflict-laden synergy between him and Wise would lay the foundation of American Reform. The Philadelphia Conference of 3‚Äì6 November 1869 saw the radicals' victory, and the adoption of a platform which summarized the theory concocted in Germany in the previous decades. Priestly privileges were abolished, as the rebuilding of the Temple was no longer anticipated; belief in the Messiah and Resurrection was denied. Michael Meyer regarded the document as the denominational \\"declaration of independence.\\" The need for religious divorce (get) was also annulled, and civil divorce confirmed as sufficient, one of the first steps towards abandonment of most ritual. While American Jews, even the nominally Orthodox, were scarcely observant, Reform began to officially dispose of practices still upheld. Its doctrine was well received by the immigrants and especially their assimilated children. Of 200 synagogues in the United States in 1860, there were a handful of Reform ones. Twenty years later, almost all of the existing 275 were part of the movement. On 8 July 1873, representatives from 34 congregations met in Melodeon Hall, Cincinnati, Ohio, and formed the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) under Wise's auspices. The name reflected his hope to unite all Jews under a single roof. In 1875, Wise also founded Hebrew Union College. Yet his attempts to maintain a moderate fa√ßade failed. In a famous incident, on 11 July 1883, during the banquet celebrating the first graduation from HUC, non-kosher food such as shrimps and crabs was served. The so-called trefa banquet, while apparently the decision of the Jewish caterer and not of Wise himself (who observed dietary laws), prompted protests from the few American traditionalists, like Sabato Morais, who remained outside the UAHC. Several conservative members later claimed to have exited the room with repulsion, though little is factually known about the incident. It was the arrival of Rabbi Alexander Kohut in 1885 which forced an unambiguous stance. Kohut, a follower of Zecharias Frankel and his Positive-Historical School, attacked the UAHC for abandoning traditional Judaism. A series of heated exchanges between him and Reform's chief ideologue, Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, encouraged the latter to convene an assembly which accepted the Pittsburgh Platform on 19 November. Embodying the spirit of \\"Classical Reform\\", it added virtually nothing to the theoretical foundation of the movement but elucidated it clearly. It was declared that to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives. A small group of conservatives withdrew from the UAHC in protest, joining Kohut, Morais, and their supporters in founding the Jewish Theological Seminary. At first unifying almost all non-Reform currents, it developed into the center of Conservative Judaism. In 1889, Wise founded the Central Conference of American Rabbis. \\"Classical Reform\\" soon faced a more pressing challenge. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe, bringing over two million Jews who had strong traditional sentiments in matters of religion even when personally lax, dwarfed the UAHC constituency within a generation. In the 1910s and 1920s, the CCAR rabbis gradually reintroduced many elements once discarded in an effort to appeal to the newcomers. The influx, and the growth of interwar antisemitism, also brought a renewed stress on Jewish particularism and peoplehood, ritual, and tradition. In contrast with the coolness toward Zionism expressed by Classicists ‚Äì emanating both from their rejection of old Messianic belief, involving a restoration of the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem, and commitment to emancipation ‚Äì many new clergymen, like Abba Hillel Silver and Stephen Wise, were enthusiastic and influential Zionists. These tendencies were codified in the 1937 Columbus Declaration of Principles, influenced by rabbis Samuel S. Cohon, Solomon Freehof and others from Eastern Europe. Anti-Zionist Reform rabbis broke away during WWII to found the American Council for Judaism,Wertheimer, J. \\"What Does Reform Judaism Stand For?\\", Commentary Magazine, June 2008 , (accessed February 2, 2009) which declined in activity following the Six-Day War. In 1950, HUC merged with the Jewish Institute of Religion, a Reform rabbinical college founded in 1922 by Rabbi Stephen Wise. The selective \\"return to tradition\\" encouraged many Americanized Eastern-European-descended Jews to flock to Reform congregations in the postwar years, rapidly swelling the membership ranks of the UAHC. This factor, along with the URJ's commitment to Outreach, diversity (\\"big tent Judaism\\"), and a welcoming attitude labeled \\"Audacious Hospitality\\" by URJ president, Rabbi Richard Jacobs, have all contributed to the Reform Movement's emergence as the largest Jewish religious denomination in North America.

In 1953, efforts to find oil in southern Libya led to the discovery of large quantities of potable fossil water underground. The Great Man-made River Project (GMRP) was conceived in the late 1960s and work on the project began in 1984. The project's construction was divided into five phases. The first phase required 85 million m¬≥ of excavation and was inaugurated on 28 August 1991. The second phase (dubbed First water to Tripoli) was inaugurated on 1 September 1996. The project is owned by the Great Man-Made River Project Authority and was funded by the Gaddafi government. The primary contractor for the first phases was Dong Ah Consortium and the present main contractor is Al Nahr Company Ltd. The imported goods were made in Korea and destined to the construction of the GMR arrived by sea via the entry port of Brega (Gulf of Sidra).

It was created as a result of the reorganisation of headquarters when the second Mediterranean front opened at Salonika. Prior to this, all British (and Dominion) units in the Mediterranean came under GHQ of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. The Dardanelles Army was created to manage operations at Gallipoli while the Salonika Army managed operations at Salonika. Both armies came under the direction of the MEF, which was also responsible for the defence of Egypt. The Dardanelles Army was short-lived as, by the time of its creation, offensive operations at Gallipoli had ceased and plans for the evacuation were being made. For most of its existence, the Army was commanded by Lieutenant General William Birdwood. It comprised the British VIII Corps and IX Corps as well as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps and the 1st Newfoundland Regiment.

The botanical name has been recognized by many taxonomists and is known as the yellow-eyed grass family. The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system of 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. This treatment in APG II represents a slight change from the APG system of 1998, which had recognized the family Abolbodaceae for some of the plants included here; that family was unplaced as to order, but was assigned to this same clade (although APG used the spelling \\"commelinoids\\"). The family contains almost 400 species in five genera, but most of the species are found in the genus Xyris (see also Abolboda). The species are mostly tropical and subtropical. The Cronquist system of 1981 also recognized such a family and placed it in the order Commelinales in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta. The Wettstein system, last updated in 1935, placed the family in order Enantioblastae. Xyris torta, twisted yellow-eyed grass, is on Minnesota's endangered species list.

Early life and education  Neil Leifer grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. At the age of thirteen, Leifer was introduced to photography through the Henry Street Settlement House, which offered free classes to the poor children of the neighborhood. Leifer began taking sports pictures, since it combined the two things that he liked. Along with Leifer, the photography group at the Settlement House produced three other photographers: John Iacono, Manny Millan, and Stanley Kubrick. When he wasn't doing photography as a youth, Leifer had odd jobs, such as shining shoes and delivering sandwiches. Eventually, he saved enough money to buy his first camera.  Career   Early career  As a boy in New York City, Leifer would gain free admission to New York Giants games by pushing the wheelchairs of handicapped patrons into the stadium. Using his free ticket and a camera, he would then position himself on the field with the photographers. Leifer gained free admission to the December 28, 1958 NFL title game between the Giants and Baltimore Colts. This game became famous as the first overtime game in league history, and is often referred to as the \\"Greatest Game Ever Played.\\" Leifer, on his sixteenth birthday, caught several images of the game- winning touchdown which he sold to Sports Illustrated. Sports Illustrated's editors liked Leifer's work and he quickly became a boy wonder at the magazine. He had his first cover shot in 1962 at age 19.  Sports Illustrated  Leifer was also known for taking risks. For the 1966 heavyweight title fight between Cleveland Williams and Muhammad Ali, he placed a camera in the rafters of the Houston Astrodome to get a shot of the canvas when the victor knocked out his competition. It has been said that it is the only photo Neil Leifer took himself that is hanging in his house, also he regards this as his favorite photograph from a 40-year professional career. His shot of Ali and a defeated Williams has been seen by millions and was voted the greatest sport photo ever by The Observer.Muhammad Ali ‚Äì 25 of the best photographs of the legendary boxer, theguardian.com. A year earlier, Leifer was one of the only two photographers with color film in his camera when Ali knocked out Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine, and his image of the moment has become not just one of his most famous photos, but one of the most memorable sports photos of all time ‚Äì seen by many as the greatest sports photograph in history. Another demanding technique, Leifer frequently used strip photography in the 1970s for athletes including Gaylord Perry and Billy Kidd, and for sports such as IndyCar racing.\\"Strip Tease: An introduction to the strip camera, how Tom Dahlin made his, and how you can too.\\", Tom Dahlin, SportsShooter, August 18, 2008Neil Leifer, Sports! features several such images Leifer photographed seven Olympic Games for the magazine and is best known for having followed Muhammad Ali's career from beginning to end. 170 of his pictures have been published on the cover of Sports Illustrated.  Time Magazine  In 1978, Leifer left sports for a wider range of assignments with Time Magazine and produced 40 covers for the magazine. His cover subjects have included, President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George Bush, Alabama football coach Bear Bryant, National Rifle Association President Joe Foss, Statue of Liberty's 100th birthday celebration, actors Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood, Pope John Paul II's visit to America, Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson, New York City Mayor Ed Koch, The Space Shuttle Columbia, President Jimmy Carter, The Animals of Africa, Olympian Carl Lewis, and actor Paul Newman. In 1992, Leifer covered both the Winter Olympic Games in Albertville, France and the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. The 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia was the fifteenth Olympic Games he has covered. In later years, Leifer gradually reduced his photography workload, turning his attention to films, although he has been known to come out of retirement for a special cover shoot for Sports Illustrated on rare occasions.  Filmmaker and documentarian  In recent years, Leifer has focused his creativity to the moving image. He is the director, producer and often writer, of noteworthy film including features, shorts, and documentaries. In 2007, Leifer was shortlisted for the documentary film short Oscar for \\"Portraits of a Lady\\" which he directed, and co-produced with Walter Bernard.
