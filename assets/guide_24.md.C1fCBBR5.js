They are designed to bridge the gap between ASIC and FPGA. They contain a grid of programmable silicon objects. Arrix range of FPOA contained three types of silicon objects arithmetic logic units (ALUs), register files (RFs) and multiply-and-accumulate units (MACs). Both the objects and interconnects are programmable. Motivation and history The device was intended to bridge the gap between field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The design goal was to combine the programmability of FPGAs and the performance of ASICs. FPGAs, although programmable, lack performance; they may only be clocked to few hundreds of megahertz and most FPGAs operated below 100 MHz. FPGAs did not offer deterministic timing and the maximum operating frequency depends on the design. ASICs offered good performance but they could not be modified and they were very costly. The FPOA had a programmable architecture deterministic timing and gigahertz performance. The FPOA was designed by Douglas Pihl who had this idea when working on a DARPA funded project. \\"Computational vision: Testing MathStar’s field-programmable object arrays\\". EDN Networks,August 14, 2013. He founded MathStar in 1997 to manufacture FPOAs and the idea was patented in 2004. The first FPOA prototypes were made in 2005 and first batch of FPOA chips were fabricated in 2006. Architecture Simplified illustration of FPOA architecture. The area between the rectangles forms peripheral circuitry and the oval around the object interface it to the rest of FPOA. FPOAs have a core grid of silicon objects or core objects. These objects are connected through a synchronous interconnect. Each core object also has a supporting structures for clock synchronization, BIST and the like. The core is surrounded by peripheral circuitry that contains memory and I/O. An interface circuitry connects the objects to rest of FPOA. Exact number of each type of object and its arrangement are specific to a given family. There are two types of communication: nearest member and \\"party-line\\". Nearest member is used to connect a core to nearest core object and party line is used to connect remote objects. There are 8 nearest neighbor interconnects per object and offers transmission speed on one object hop per clock cycle. There are 10 party line interconnect per object that offers transmission speed of four object hops per clock cycle. Applications FPOAs may be used almost anywhere an FPGA is used, broadly in all hardware acceleration tasks including digital signal processing, medical imaging, computer vision, speech recognition, cryptography, bioinformatics, computer hardware emulation, and aerospace. Since FPOAs are built around fast and optimized silicon objects they offer higher performance in flat field error correction, fast Fourier transform computation, medical imaging, machine vision, image encoding and decoding, video encoding and decoding and artificial intelligence acceleration to name a few. Development on FPOA In FPOA we work at silicon object level a higher level than the gate level used in FPGA. This eases the learning curve and also speeds up development. Programming is done in System C. The Arrix family released in 2006 was supported by FPOA design software, which enabled designers to create, verify, program and debug their algorithms on the devices. Summit Design's Visual Elite tool was used for behavioural simulation. MathStar's COAST (COnnection and ASsignment Tool) offered a graphical environment for floor-planning and placement it compiled to an intermediate code that maps to hardware resources. The Object compiler generated the file to be loaded into the FPGA. In 2007 MathStar struck a partnership with mentor graphics and subsequent release use Visual Elite editor from Mentor Graphics for behavioural simulation and functional verification. FPOAs also offered IP core library IP partners included professionals in the video market as well as machine vision market. Present status MathStar the producer of FPOAs never posted a profit and the company decided to shut down production in May 2008. MathStar was merged into Sajan Inc. in 2010 and Sajan thus acquired MathStar's patent including that of FPOAs. In November 2011, Sajan sold several of MathStar's patent including some on FPOAs to OLK Grun GmbH.

Career  = Manchester City = Born in Accra, Donyoh progressed through the Right to Dream academy and moved to English club Manchester City as a 17-year- old. He progressed through the youth system, before it was decided that he was to be loaned out. Loans to Sweden From there, he was loaned out to Swedish club Djurgårdens IF in 2013 through a cooperation agreement between the clubs, in order to receive more playing time. This was agreed upon after impressing in a trial over three games. In the 2012–13 Svenska Cupen, Donyoh reached the final with the club where they eventually lost to IF Elfsborg. In the league, he made 20 appearances in which made two goals and contributed with two assists. He also made thirteen appearances for the Djurgården U21 in which he scored 10 goals and made one assist. After the season, Manchester City informed Djurgården that his loan could be extended, but that Donyoh would have to be utilised as a forward instead of as a winger; the position where Djurgården had mostly played him. The Swedish club could not guarantee playing time as a forward, and it was therefore decided that Donyoh would return to Manchester City. After his return to England, Donyoh took part in team training before being loaned out to another Swedish Allsvenskan club, this time to Falkenbergs FF. He scored his first goal for Falkenbergs FF on 12 May 2014 against his former club Djurgården - a 90th-minute goal securing a 1-0 win. In 35 competitive games for the first team and the U21, he scored seven goals and made four assists. At the end of 2015 season, Falkenbergs FF won out in a relegation battle with IK Sirius, and thus ensured a place in the top division for the following season. =Nordsjælland= Having made no appearances for Manchester City since his arrival in 2011, Donyoh was signed on a permanent deal by Danish Superliga club FC Nordsjælland ahead of the 2015–16 season; a club also involved in the Right to Dream academy. Donyoh's most successful season for the club was during the 2018–19 season, where he managed to score ten goals and make two assists in 28 league appearances. As Nordsjælland had finished third in the previous year's Superliga, he took part in the Europa League qualifying rounds with the team, who were eventually knocked out in the third round against Serbian club Partizan. Loan to Dynamo Dresden After making only nine appearances during the 2018–19 season, three of them for the Nordsjælland reserves, Donyoh was loaned with an option to buy to German 2.

Happiness is defined as the degree to which an individual judges the quality of his or her life as a whole favorably. Two 'components' of happiness are distinguished: hedonic level of affect (the degree to which pleasant affect dominates) and contentment (perceived realization of wants). Aims The World Database of Happiness is a tool to quickly acquire an overview on the ever-growing stream of research findings on happiness Medio 2019 the database covered some 30,000 scientific findings, of which about 12,500 are distributional findings (on how happy people are) and another 17,500 correlational findings (on factors associated with more and less happiness).Veenhoven, R. (2009) World database of happiness. Psychological Topics, 18: 221-246.http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/index.html The first findings date from 1915. Findings The World Database of Happiness is a ‘findings archive’, which consists of electronic ‘finding pages’ on which separate research results are described in a standard format and terminology. These finding pages can be selected on various characteristics, such as population studies, the measure of happiness used and observed co-variates. All finding-pages have a specific internet address to which links can be made in scientific review papers or policy recommendations. This allows a concise presentation of many findings in a table, while providing readers with access to detail.Veenhoven, R. (2014). World database of happiness. Encyclopedia of Quality of Life and Well-Being Research, 7257-7260. Scientific use The Database has been used in hundreds scientific studies, for example to access under what conditions economic growth enhances average happiness Oishi, S., & Kesebir, S. (2015). Income inequality explains why economic growth does not always translate to an increase in happiness.

Popular use The World Database of Happiness is often used by popular media to make lists of the happiest countries around the globe.http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global- database/ne-data/11940-happiest-countries.html#axzz2VQh2jLfD An example is the Happy Planet Index, which aims to chart sustainable happiness all over the world by combining data on longevity, happiness and the size of the ecological footprint of citizens.http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ Strengths and weaknesses The database has a clear conceptual focus, it includes only research findings on subjective enjoyment of one’s life as a whole. Thereby it evades the Babel that has haunted the study of happiness for ages. The other side of that coin is that much interesting research is left out. The findings are reported with technical details about measurement and statistical analysis. This detail is welcomed by scholars, but makes the information difficult to digest for lay-persons. Still another limitation is that the available findings are often contradictory, which makes it hard to draw firm conclusions about the causes of happiness. What is clear is that poor health, separation, unemployment and lack of social contact are all strongly negatively associated with happiness.Dolan, P., Peasgood, T. & White, M. (2008). Do we really know what makes us happy? A review of the economic literature on the factors associated with subjective well-being. Journal of Economic Psychology, 29, 94-122. Another problem for the World database of happiness is that the number of studies on happiness increases with such a high rate that it gets increasingly difficult to offer a complete overview of all research findings. A further concern is that the Database of Happiness is exclusively focused on hedonic happiness (feeling good) and not on matureWong, P. T. P. (2017i, May 16).

Paul Wong of the INPM put it like this: \\"The World Database of Happiness does not even include research findings of happiness in suffering. The reality is that all those suffering from a variety of misfortunes—such as poverty, sickness, accidents, or discrimination and oppression—also want to know how they can experience happiness; therefore, psychologists and policymakers need to be concerned about their needs.\\"Wong, P.

England and Wales Birth Register Q1, 1892, Newport, Ref 11a/209 – 28 November 1947) was a leading British amateur golfer, golf club administrator, and golf course architect in the years between the wars. A former reserve army officer, Tippet was for a time a close associate of millionaire American property developer Carl G. Fisher, the man who created the Miami Beach, Florida resort, for whom he designed a number of golf courses in Florida and Long Island. He was one of the most successful British amateur golfers of the 1920s and 1930s and later served as secretary at several prestigious UK golf clubs. His wife was the grandmother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.  Early life  Herbert Charles Coningsby Tippet M.C. (he preferred to be known as Charles and rarely used his third name)The correct spelling of his surname was Tippet but it was frequently misspelt, even in official publications, as Tippett. England and Wales Birth Index, Q1 1892 Newport, vol.11a, p.209 was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, on 23 November 1891 into a family originally from the south-west of England, and brought up in Bristol1901 Census of England and Wales. Surname incorrectly spelt as Tippett. and Sudbury, Suffolk. Baptised in St. Woollos, now Newport Cathedral, on 27 February 1892, he was the son of a retired Lieutenant-Colonel turned surveyor, Conservative Party agent and keen amateur golfer. Tippet's father, who had served in the Second Boer War, re- applied for his commission at the outbreak of the First World War and was later killed while serving at Gallipoli. He had been the founder and first captain of Newton Green Golf Club in Sudbury. The middle child and only son in a family of three, Charles Tippet acquired two things from his father; a lifelong interest in the British Army and an outstanding ability to play golf. It had always been understood that Tippet would follow his father into the army. Whilst at private school, he served in the Army Cadet Force and was commissioned into the Territorial Force when it absorbed the Cadet Force in 1908, being commissioned on 27 November 1908 as a Second Lieutenant in the 5th (Territorial) Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment based at Bury St. Edmunds.London Gazette, 22 December 1908  Military career  On leaving school in 1910, Tippet did not become a professional soldier. Instead, he followed his father's occupation, briefly training as a Land Surveyor, a skill which he was later to put to good use in landscaping golf courses, and he applied to join the Special Reserve of Officers, into which he was commissioned as a Probationer Second Lieutenant on 2 April 1910,London Gazette 1 April 1910 in the 4th (Extra or Special Reserve) Battalion4th Battalion is referred to alternatively as Extra Reserve and Special Reserve Battalion in various editions of the London Gazette of his father's regiment the Royal Dublin Fusiliers; an Irish infantry regiment of the British Army. The Special Reserve of Officers was a cadre of trained civilians who served as part-time officers for a fixed number of weeks each year and who were available to be mobilized in the event of war. For Irish regiments, it served a similar function to the Territorial Force in England. He completed six months of basic officer training between 1910 and 1911 during which time he was seconded to 2nd Battalion at Farnborough Barracks, Hampshire.Manwaring, Arthur E. (1911) Crown and Company, the Historical Records of the 2nd Batt. Royal Dublin Fusiliers, Formerly the 1st Bombay European Regiment, Vol. 1, reprinted by Forgotten Books, London 2013, , page 10. He appears at Farnborough Barracks on the 1911 Census of England and Wales By then he had developed his father's love of golf and became a successful amateur in the years immediately prior to the First World War, representing Royal North Devon Golf Club.Spalding's Official Golf Guide for 1915, p.179 After completing basic officer training at Aldershot, he was confirmed in his rank on 2 June 1911London Gazette 2 June 1911, p.4183 and transferred back to 4th Battalion, at that time stationed at Richmond Barracks in Templemore, Tipperary, where he became a member of The Royal Dublin Golf Club. On 1 December of that year, he was promoted to Lieutenant.London Gazette, 19 January 1912, p. 454 In 1913 he was sent to the School of Musketry in Hythe, Kent where he received a first-class certificate in small-arms use and on 16 April 1913 he was awarded the title of Officer Instructor of Musketry, effectively the depot's small-arms training officer. The appointment brought with it the position of Assistant Adjutant, a junior staff post.Army Lists, February 1915, p.691, National Library of Scotland https://digital.nls.uk/british-military- lists/archive/106360300?mode=transcription Tippet became a full-time soldier when the Special Reserve of Officers was mobilized on the outbreak of the First World War, following which, on 6 September 1914, he was promoted to Captain.London Gazette 6 February 1915, p. 1216 (first name incorrectly printed as Henry instead of Herbert) In October, he transferred with the Battalion to Sittingbourne in England, returning to Templemore in December 1915. 4th Battalion acted mainly as a recruitment and training unit and Tippet spent the first two years of World War I engaged in second-line duties but that was to change in the spring of 1916 when he was to see action for the first time. On 24 April 1916 the Easter Rising occurred in Dublin and the following day, Tippet's Battalion was one of a number of units sent in to suppress the uprising. They forced their way into the centre of Dublin and fought the insurgents along the railway line from Broadstone Station to Cabra Bridge. After the rebels withdrew, 4th Battalion formed a cordon around the area until the rising ended. Shortly after, Tippet left Ireland. The Dublins had suffered severe casualties at Hulluch, near Loos, and replacements were urgently needed. On 14 May 1916, he was posted to France in the build-up to the Somme offensive, serving on attachment to the 8th (Service) Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, 48th Infantry Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division throughout the Somme campaign. Tippet is listed among the officers who took part in the Battle of Ginchy from 3 to 10 September 1916.8th Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers War Diary for October 1916 On 6 July 1917 his attachment to 8th Battalion ended and from 9 July he was appointed Staff Captain GSO3Supplement to the London Gazette, 16 August 1917, p.8437 attached to the 1/1 Herts, 118th Infantry Brigade, 39th Division, in preparation for the Third Battle of Ypres where 118th Brigade saw action. No record exists of his military actions although, many years later, his step-son wrote that he had fought gallantly and Hansen refers to him as a war hero. He was mentioned in dispatches on 7 November 1917London Gazette 7 December 1917, p. 12921 for gallantry at Passchendaele and from March to April 1918 he took part in the First Battles of the Somme. 39th Division took heavy casualties in helping to prevent the Germans from breaking through to the coast during which Tippet suffered a head wound from shrapnelSuffolk and Essex Free Press, 17 April 1918, p.8 and he was subsequently awarded the Military Cross; an award given for \\"an act or acts of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy\\",London Gazette 1 January 1919 along with the standard campaign medals. The physical injuries would eventually heal but the mental scars never did. After serving for two years as a front-line infantry officer on the Somme and at Passchendaele, Tippet's experiences left him suffering severely from shell-shock, a condition which meant he was unable to cope with sudden loud noises and which was to remain with him for life.Milwaukee Journal, 23 May 1931 The medical condition brought his military career to an end. He left the army at the end of the war but chose to be known as Captain Tippet in civilian life, a title generally considered appropriate only for ex-cavalry officers, which Tippet was not. He was to re-apply for his commission at the outbreak of the Second World War and on 26 May 1940 was commissioned into the General Service Corps as a LieutenantLondon Gazette 2 July 1940 but awarded the War Substantive rank of Captain and placed on the General List (a reserve of experienced former officers who could be mobilized if needed). However, he did not see active service and was released on health grounds at the end of 1943. Following his release from the General List he was granted the lifetime honorary rank of Major on 1 January 1944.Supplement to the London Gazette, 4 January 1944, p.80  Golfing career  Having been invalided out of the army, Tippet was obliged to seek a new career and decided to earn his living from golf. However, although he was a golfer of considerable ability, he never played as a professional. His real forte was to lie in golf administration and in the designing of golf courses, learning his craft by studying the methods of Old Tom Morris, the architect of Royal North Devon and inventor of the modern golf course, and of James Braid who had re-built Newton Green. In 1919, Tippet was appointed manager of Ashford Manor Golf Club in Middlesex working for club captain and secretary Harold Hilton, a winner of two British Amateurs, under whom Tippet learned the business of running a golf club. Hilton was a well-known player on both sides of the Atlantic having won both the British and U.S. Amateurs in 1911 and was a member of the prestigious Apawamis Golf Club in Westchester, New York. When the nearby Meadow Brook Golf Club in Westbury, Long Island was looking for a new secretary in 1921, Hilton recommended his protégé Charles Tippet. Tippet left Southampton for New York on 5 November 1921 being joined a month later by his wife and step-son. Meadow Brook was at that time a nine-hole course with a history stretching back to 1894. Tippet started working on improvements to the course and immediately began to acquire a reputation as a course designer. Unusually, despite having briefly trained as a Land Surveyor, he preferred to work from putty or clay models rather than drawings.The Evening News, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 4 February 1927, p.20Warren Tribune, Warren, Pennsylvania, 17 December 1926, p.7 He was quickly to attract a circle of wealthy patrons and soon began receiving commissions to design 9-hole courses on private Long Island estates; the first at Gustave Heckscher's Upland House, the second at Middleton Burrill's Jericho Farm, both in Westbury. A third followed on Julius Fleischmann's Lindens estate at Sands Point, Port Washington. The Miami News, 10 December 1924, p. 18, via newspapers.com ref: 12014 His first major commission then followed to design a 9-hole and two 18-hole courses at the former William Phelps Manor in Teaneck, New Jersey, then being developed as a leisure facility. One of these courses is now the Overpeck Golf Club (6,584 yards, par 72), the remainder having been built over.The Miami News, 10 December 1924, p. 18, via newspapers.com ref: 12014 After taking up his duties as club secretary, Tippet began competing as an amateur in east coast tournaments while representing both Meadow Brook and Royal North Devon where he had retained his membership. A short, stocky right-hander always to be seen in baggy cap and plus-fours, he was the leading amateur in the Metropolitan Open at Lido in September 1922, and the following month he reached the second round of the Nassau Country Club invitation tournament at Glen Cove, New York. In 1923 he finished runner-up in the Metropolitan Amateur at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York, becoming acquainted with many of the leading U.S. golfers, among them the legendary Gene Sarazen. That year Tippet was introduced to property millionaire and keen golfer Carl Graham Fisher, possibly by Sarazen who was a friend of both men. Fisher, who had been responsible for the development of Miami Beach, was then considering building a number of golf courses in Miami. Tippet was recommended to design them and became closely associated with Fisher for the next few years. Golf was enjoying an enormous boom in popularity in America in the years immediately following the First World War as an enriched middle class, excluded from more elitist country sports, sought new leisure activities open to anyone with the necessary application and resources. Although the U.S. would soon dominate the game, in the early 1920s U.S. golf still looked across the Atlantic for a lead in both coaching and course design, and Britons with the necessary skills and experience were in high demand. Fisher planned to construct a complex of three courses catering for all standards of player; 9-hole and 18-hole courses for learners and recreational golfers, and a more challenging championship course at which it was intended to stage exhibition matches and PGA Tour events. The recreational courses were to be constructed and brought into use quickly while the championship course was to be a more ambitious longer-term project. Tippet's first design for Fisher was the Bayshore course at Miami Beach Tippet's first design for Fisher was for alterations to the Bayshore Golf Club at Alton Beach, Miami (6,903 yards, par 72) which had been designed by Willie ParkFlorida Department of State, Historic Golf Trail, http://floridahistoricgolftrail.com/courses/miami-beach-golf-club/ in 1921. Tippet's redesigned course opened in 1923 followed much later by the 18-hole championship course at La Gorce (6,295 yards, par 70). Three years in design and construction and built on a former mangrove swamp with links dredged from Biscayne Bay, La Gorce finally opened on 7 January 1927Warren Tribune, Warren, Pennsylvania, 17 December 1926 with Willie Klein as club professional. Together with a 9-hole par-3 course they were to form Fisher's prestigious Miami Beach Golf Club which he hoped would attract wealthy northerners to Florida. During the winter of 1923 Tippet left Meadow Brook and moved with his family to Florida where he was appointed golf director at Miami Beach.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 10 February 1924, p.42 Fisher built a house for him on Prairie Avenue, between the Miami Beach and Bayshores courses, complete with observation tower from which he could supervise both courses.Palm Beach Post, 18 July 1924 The following year he designed two further Florida courses for Fisher, the first at his new Hollywood Beach Hotel Country Club (6,376 yards, par 70). Taken into public ownership in 1929, the course was re-built by Donald Ross and remains a municipal course to this day. The second was for an 18-hole course at Fisher's short-lived Nautilus Hotel at Miami Beach which opened in 1924 and closed when the complex became a military hospital. The Miami News, 10 December 1924, p. 18, via newspapers.com ref: 12014 A further commission came his way that year for a 9-hole course at Homestead, Miami which later re-opened as the 6,139 yard, par 72 Redland Golf and Country Club in 1947.The Miami News, 10 December 1924, p. 18, via newspapers.com ref: 12014 Tippet continued to compete in amateur events and in 1924 he won the inaugural Dixie Amateur at the Miami Country Club and finished as the top amateur in that year's Miami Open.Palm Beach Post 14 December 1924, p.3 At this time, Tippet first met Robert Trent Jones when he had come down to Florida to give lessons, and the two spent time together discussing their contrasting philosophies on golf course design. Although only 18 years of age, Jones was already a prolific golfer and would later become one of golf's most renowned course architects, going on to re-design some of Tippet's courses. Three years after their first meeting, Tippet was instrumental in persuading Jones, Sarazen and a number of other leading U.S. golfers to take part in the first La Gorce Open, a PGA Tour event which ran from 1928 until 1931. Johnny Farrell was the inaugural winner of the event. The course at La Gorce at the time of the La Gorce Open In 1925, Tippet had gone on record to say that he believed there was then a market for as many as ten more courses in Florida to meet the ever-growing demand for golf. He estimated that up to $1million would need to be spent on construction and a further $250,000 per annum on running them in the first two years alone, no doubt hoping that a share of this would be coming his way.Miami Daily News, 29 August 1926 By this time he was managing not only Bayshore and Miami Beach Golf Clubs but also the Flamingo Hotel 9-hole course (3,150 yards)Ballinger, Kenneth (1936), Miami Millions: The Dance of the Dollar in the Great Florida Land Boom of 1925, Franklin Press, Miami, , p.87 which he had designed for Fisher as part of his Flamingo Hotel project, along with another of Fisher's developments, the Flamingo Polo Club.Polk's Miami Directory for 1925, p.1246 Despite their close association, Tippet did not work exclusively for Fisher. Following the opening of the Miami Beach courses, he was engaged to design a public course at Normandy Isle, Florida. The latter was to be built on 120 acres of land donated to the City of Miami Beach and for which Tippet submitted a building estimate of $119,200.City of Miami Beach, Council Minutes,15 April 1927, Book 7, p. 429 However, due to the Great Depression, the project was postponed and work did not commence until 1937 using an amended design by Toomy and Flynn. In 1925, Tippet became involved in a new development with Gene Sarazen. On 26 July that year a new company known as South Florida Golf and Country Club Inc. was incorporated for the purpose of creating a new residential district and golf club some ten miles north of Miami to be known as Golf Park. Built at a cost of $1.5 million and opened on 1 January 1926, the new club had leading Scottish-American golfer W.D. Patterson as its manager. At the heart of this development was a new course designed by Tippet, (6,300 yards, par 70) which he believed to be one of the best courses in Florida.New York Evening Post, 29 October 1925 Sarazen and Leo Diegel were hired as club professionals to front the new enterprise.http://www.findthatpdf.com/search-32212428-hPDF/download- documents-ag295x.pdf.htm The idea for the development had first been mooted in 1924 although the company was not formed for another two years and it is unclear whether Tippet was financially involved or merely employed to build the golf course. Unfortunately, shortly after the Golf Park course opened it was damaged by bad weather following which it was hit by the 1926 Miami hurricane which devastated Miami and much of South Florida, necessitating its closure for most of the year.The Florida Golf Course Seeker http://theflgolfcourseseeker.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/miami-national-golf-club- course.html It re-opened on 19 December but in the meantime some $750,000 had been spent on a lavish clubhouseBrown, Innis, \\"Golf Park, Another Miami Rendezvous\\", New York Sun, 25 February 1926 and the enforced closure was a blow from which the backers could not recover. The project failed and the golf club closed in the spring of 1927 when the company ran out of money.The company subsequently changed hands but was wound-up on 23 November 1936. Florida Company Register https://www.fl-registry.com/110845-south-florida- golf-and-country-club-inc If, as one report suggests, Tippet lost his fortune in Florida real estate, it is likely to have been in this ill-starred venture.Pinkley, Virgil, San Bernardino Sun, 21 May 1931, p.18 (The project was later resurrected as the Westview Country Club before closing in 2011.) Another public course at Westside, Fort Lauderdale (6,915 yards, par 72) opened in November 1926.Miami Daily News and Metropolis, 29 November 1926 Commissioned by the City Council, this course later became the Fort Lauderdale Golf and Country Club. Buoyed by the success of Miami Beach, Fisher turned his attention to Long Island where he intended to build a \\"Miami of the North\\" and in 1926 instructed Captain Tippet to design two new courses at the eastern end of the Hamptons. A new 18-hole course at Montauk Downs (6,976 yards, par 72) opened in 1927. Rebuilt by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in 1968, it is still considered to be one of the most difficult courses on Long Island due to the strong wind from the ocean on both sides. A short-lived second course was built at nearby Hither Hills. But the Long Island development was not, at the time, a financial success and Tippet's association with Fisher was finally ended by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 which brought the boom in American golf course construction, temporarily, to an end. Meanwhile, in January 1927, Tippet had won one last amateur tournament in America, beating C.A. Roberts 9 and 8 to take the Glenn Curtiss match play trophy at Miami-HialaehMiami News 19 January 1928 before returning to England in April to take up a new post as secretary of Royal Wimbledon Golf Club, a prestigious club with the Prince of Wales as captain. He also resumed playing in UK amateur competitions, reaching the fifth round of the British Amateur Championship at Royal North Devon in 1931, a tournament then regarded as a Major. The following year he reached the last eight in the same championship and was talked about for that year's Walker Cup team.Syndicated article retrieved from Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser 9 June 1932 In 1935 he won the London Amateur Foursomes and was captain of Surrey County Golf Union from 1938 until 1947.Surrey Golf Year Book 2016, p.19, (name spelt incorrectly as Tippett) https://s3cdn.joomag.com/pdf/0/177/177872/0471252001471429217.pdf?name=Surrey+Golf+YearBook+2016+Revised&1471413358 After ten years at Royal Wimbledon, Tippet moved on to Walton Heath Golf Club, later to be the venue for the 1981 Ryder Cup, where he served as secretary from 1937 until 1945. In 1938, whilst at Walton Heath, Tippet received a commission to re-design Tramore Golf Club, (6,700 yards, par 72) near Waterford in Ireland, a course which still boasts of his association. The following year, he redesigned part of Walton Heath, combining the 5th and 6th holes into a revised 5th, and creating new 6th and 7th holes. In 1945 he was engaged as secretary by Rye Golf Club in Sussex, then suffering from severe damage as a result of wartime defensive works, with a brief to re-construct and repair the links; which he did while creating new short 2nd and 7th holes to avoid a road which crossed the course. However, Major Tippet, as he had become by this time, was not a well man having been released by the army as a result of his shattered nerves in 1943, and this appointment was to prove his last. On 26 November 1947, he collapsed in his office at Rye and died two days later.England and Wales Death Index, Q4 1947, Battle, Sussex, vol.5h, p.24. Surname incorrectly spelt as Tippett.  Golf course design philosophy  Tippet's trademark was simplicity. His well-won reputation came from his willingness to adhere closely to the design concepts which he had learned from Morris and Braid and which, by the 1920s, were being increasingly disregarded by many of Tippet's contemporaries. British and American course architects were beginning to diverge in their approaches, with Britons still preferring the traditional links style of course while US designers were increasingly moving toward more landscaped parkland courses. Robert Trent Jones in particular held differing views from Tippet on course design resulting from their backgrounds on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Tippet declined to over- elaborate his courses, avoiding the excessive use of bunkers and other hazards behind his greens. Instead, he employed an economy of landscaping, preferring to allow the natural topography of the course to present its own challenges. For example, of Montauk Downs it has been said: Of La Gorce it was said: while Tramore claims: Only at the Golf Park course did he make lavish use of bunkers and hazards, requiring the golfer to use every club in the bag to get round. Generally, his greens were flat and he avoided the artificial ridges and dips that other architects increasingly relied upon. The over-use of such devices by other designers, whilst adding a further degree of difficulty to a hole, did not add to its par which was based solely on yardage to the pin. Tippet's courses, in contrast, afforded a more realistic opportunity to achieve par and encouraged bold approach play, which proved equally popular with both professionals and recreational golfers.Miami Daily News, 25 March 1928  Personal life and reputation  In November 1921 Tippet married Edith Marguerite Shand (née Harrington), a divorcée, formerly married to architectural critic and writer Philip Morton Shand, at St. Martin-in-the- Fields, London.England and Wales Marriage Index, Q4 1921, London, vol. 1a, p. 1320 The only child of her first marriage, Bruce Shand (1917–2006) married the Hon.

There were no children of the marriage. In 2005 and 2006 the British newspaper The Daily Mail ran a series of articlesDaily Mail, 2 April 2005 and 17 June 2006 alleging that Charles Tippet had been a \\"cad\\" who had exaggerated his war record and exploited his bearing and accent to curry favour in America, and that his wife had been an unfit mother; claiming that she had abandoned her son, having herself been abandoned as a child. The following year, another newspaper, the Daily Mirror, ran the same story. No evidence was provided by either newspaper to substantiate the accusations against Tippet, and the statements about his wife were untrue. (As a teenager, Mrs. Tippet and her elder brother had, for a time, lodged with their grandparents due to space constraints at home - common practice in large Edwardian families - but at no time was she ever abandoned.1901 and 1911 Censuses of England and Wales The Tippets took their son with them to America where he lived until 1927. Bruce Shand said nothing in his autobiography about having been abandoned, he merely said that his childhood had been \\"mouvementé\\" - 'turbulent' or 'eventful'; but his decision to omit from the book all reference to his early life in America has given rise to the frequently- repeated misconception that the Tippets abandoned him.) Although the Tippets had enjoyed celebrated company and a lavish lifestyle during America's Jazz Age in the 1920s, Tippet was never a wealthy man.Virgil Pinkley of United Press commented that \\"He [Tippet] is supposed to have lost his fortune in Florida real estate\\" but no evidence has been found to support this assertion. San Bernardino Sun, 21 May 1931, p.18 His playing record shows he was clearly a golfer of considerable ability and had he played as a professional in the modern era, he would have been well rewarded. Instead, his amateur status meant he earned nothing from his playing career and after the lucrative design contracts in America came to an end, he earned a modest income as a golf administrator. There is no record of his having ever owned any of the addresses at which he resided and he left no will and few assets.England and Wales National Probate Calendar 1858 - 1966, 8 April 1949, Estate £666.

It looks at efforts made by Imperial Germany during the First World War to use its connections with the Muslim world to defeat the British Empire, including directing an Islamic jihad against it. Argument Haydarpasha Istanbul - designed to be a flagship station of the Berlin to Baghdad railway: Kaiser Wilhelm's Weltpolitik taking concrete form (from McMeekin's Prologue) As the Ottoman Empire lined up with Germany during the First World War a project unfolded to turn the Muslim world against British power: 'from Tripoli to Kabul', the Germans '[spread] jihad, guns and bribes'. France, Russia and Britain ruled over millions of Muslim subjects in their colonial territories. Their resentment over infidel rule might be inflamed in a European war. Imperial latecomer Germany had only a small number of Islamic subjects, by comparison, in her African empire. Afghanistan and Persia were sought as allies for an attack on British India. And desperate attempts were made to finish the Berlin-Baghdad railway. Its construction had begun in 1903 but financial and technical considerations had delayed it - German concerns about the massacre of Armenians in 1915 centered around the delay it caused to further construction.George Walden review in the guardian Caliph of Sunni Islam, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, wanted a European ally who could stand up to the Triple Entente powers Contents Hussein, the Sherif of Mecca was central to Oppenheim's plans Chapters of the book discuss efforts by Max von Oppenheim - the Kaiser's personal envoy - to take charge of the Turko-German holy war, the Baghdad Railway, the Young Turks, the Young Turk Revolution, the declaration of the 'global jihad', the Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, the activity of Leo Frobenius and Alois Musil, the Raid on the Suez Canal, and the Gallipoli Campaign. German emperor Wilhelm II - restless, unbalanced, and lacking the ability to note contradictions - befriended not only Abdul Hamid II on his first visit to Constantinople, in 1889, but also the Viennese journalist Theodore Herzl, usually considered the father of Zionism. the Kaiser promptly lobbied Sultan Abdul Hamid on Herzl's behalf. Oppenheim arrived in Constantinople April 1915 - proposing a tour of Asiatic Turkey, setting up jihad propaganda bureaux in Constantinople, Konya, Aleppo, Damascus, Beirut and Jerusalem. Central to his plans for reinvigorating the Ottoman holy war was the still undefined role of Hussein, the Sherif of Mecca. One of Hussein's sons, Faisal - the future king of Syria and Iraq - came to Constantinople to iron out the Hashemite family's differences with the Young Turk regime. He met Oppenheim in Oppenheim's room at the Pera Palace Hotel on 24 April 1915. Oppenheim did not want to discuss relocating the locus of spiritual power with the Sherifs in Mecca; 'the Ottoman Caliphate must remain the unique and central focus towards which the eyes of all Muslims are directed,' he said. According to him it was the duty of all Muslims to fight against English intrigues, to follow the commandments of the Ottoman Caliphate and safeguard the force and prestige of Islam. Faisal didn't share Oppenheim's high regard for the primacy of the Ottoman Caliph. Reviews George Walden wrote in The Guardian that \\"McMeekin has written a powerful, overdue book that for many will open up a whole new side to the First World War\\".The Guardian, July 18, 2010 George Walden review in the Guardian And Brendan Simms, writing in The Independent, praised the book - \\"As Sean McMeekin shows in his riveting new book – based on a knowledge not only of the British and German records, but also the Russian-Turkish documents – Berlin's strategy in the Ottoman Empire went well beyond the railroad, which was still winding its way through Anatolia when war broke out in 1914. It formed part of a much broader project of fomenting internal revolution in order to weaken the entente powers, and if possible to knock one or the other out of the war altogether.\\"The Independent, 25 June 2010 Mehmet Yercil, in Times Higher Education, wrote positively about the book but noted that \\"McMeekin tends to give some credence to the official, apologetic Turkish view that the Armenians, like the Hejaz Arabs a while later, could become a fifth column, especially after the defeat of the Ottoman Third Army against Russia had left the gates of Eastern Anatolia wide open. Indeed, McMeekin states that the Armenians were deported only in Eastern Anatolia.\\" Yercil wondered how that could \\"account for the fact that, for example, this reviewer's west-central Anatolian home town, Eskisehir, before the war had an Armenian quarter and a Rue Arménienne that no longer exist?\\" He thought McMeekin's account could have \\"benefited from a consideration of recent analyses by Hilmar Kaiser and Isabel Hull. On the other hand, his handling of two very complex subjects, namely how the Ottoman Empire entered the war, and what really happened on the Caucasian front after the Bolshevik capitulation in 1917, are the best one will encounter in the historical field.\\"Times Higher Education 25 November 2010 Times Higher Education review Further reading *The Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany’s Bid for World Power, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 2010,  References  Category:2010 non-fiction books ","title":"The Berlin-Baghdad Express"},{"id":"40248305","text":"Neurotomy may refer to the application of heat (as in radio frequency nerve lesioning) or freezing to sensory nerve fibers to cause their temporary degeneration, usually to relieve pain.

The skyscraper is the sixth–tallest building in Melbourne and the ninth–tallest building in Australia.  History  = Initial project = In 1984, the Schiavello group bought the 35 Queensbridge Square site in Southbank; among the group's first land purchase in Melbourne. By 2002, the group formally submitted plans to the State Government for a 225–metre (738 foot) tall residential skyscraper – in the midst of oversupply or \\"glut\\" concerns within the inner–city apartment market. Nevertheless, the $AUD230 million project, then dubbed 'Prima on Southbank', would have been one of the tallest residential buildings in Melbourne, only surpassed by the nearby Eureka Tower (under–construction at the time), but considerably taller than Freshwater Place North, which was also being constructed in 2002 adjacent to the Prima development. The 63–level skyscraper was designed by Australian architect, Ivan Rijavec, and the project would have comprised 332 residential apartments. Approval was granted for the skyscraper in 2004, by then–Minister for Planning Mary Delahunty; however, one of the conditions of approval was that the skyscraper be reduced in height to , a move supported by the Melbourne City Council which recommended buildings in Southbank to not eclipse such height. Schiavello challenged the condition for approval at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which upheld the skyscraper's initial height on the basis that the design was \\"exemplary\\". Despite the win, the project never proceeded to sales, and was henceforth shelved by the developer until 2009. = Subsequent development = The project was relaunched by Schiavello in 2010, this time with the collaboration of fellow developer PDG Corporation. Initially, the proposal submitted to the Minister for Planning was for a skyscraper which would be identical in height to the previous design; however, the number of apartments within the building almost doubled to 616. Other amendments included: a reduction in the number of car park spaces, and an increase to the number of floors within the building (from 63 to 66). During this planning phase, the developers were also pursuing a height increase for the skyscraper, which they later submitted and gained approval. Pursuant to the final plans for the project, the building would comprise two main residential lobbies; 'Prima' would contain half of the residential apartments across the higher section of the building, whilst 'Pearl' would contain the remaining apartments within the lower section of the building. Overall, the skyscraper would reach a height of , with 72 levels; among amenities such as a swimming pool, the 67–level features a sky–lounge for residents of Prima Pearl. Early works and construction, which was undertaken by Multiplex on the AUD$292 million skyscraper, commenced as early as March 2012. By July 2014, Prima Pearl had topped–out and was completed later that year. Upon completion, Prima Pearl was the fourth–tallest building in Melbourne and the fifth–tallest building in Australia. It currently remains the fourth-tallest in Melbourne, and has been surpassed as the fifth–tallest in Australia (it is now the sixth).Prima Pearl - The Skyscraper Center.

It is based on the 2001 Formula One season. A port for GameCube has been planned, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A Game Boy Color version was also cancelled during development. The gameplay focuses on a new training mode which allows players to improve their skills and eventually be able to unlock new modes as the progress of training is made. F1 2001 was well received by critics and received a nomination from GameSpot for their Driving Game of the Year. Gameplay Gameplay of the Xbox Version The game features the 17 tracks and a select choice of 22 drivers who competed in the 2001 season. The modes feature the quick race format where the player gains points to access the 17 Tracks. The premiere mode of the game is called \\"Grand Prix\\" which includes five distinct modes of gameplay including: a full championship season with all the 17 rounds of the 2001 season that includes the Practice and Qualifying sessions along with the Race itself, a single race weekend, a custom championship where the player chooses how many rounds he/she chooses to compete, a teammate challenge where the player must defeat every teammate in all the 11 teams, a domination mode where the player must win every round of the championship without conceding defeat. For the first time in a Formula One game, there is a training mode where players may hone their skills on the track. Such training includes: practice race starts, driving the car with manual gears, learning how to drive in changeable conditions such as rain, the handling of various types of corners such as a Chicane, how to deal with various types of damage sustained to the car and practice pit stops for the player to find out the time it takes to get into the pit lane to take on fuel and new tires before returning to the circuit. This game is unique as the more challenges are completed, the more game modes are unlocked in Grand Prix mode. This format is similar to the license tests in Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec. Other features in the game are Team Radio, which helps the player with feedback from the driver's race engineer, a replay mode, which allows anyone to go back and view key moments within a limited amount of time, the inclusion of the official FIA rules and regulations, and the ability of all the cars to be fine-tuned as in previous games such as F1 2000. Development The developers had collaborated with insiders who worked for BAR to help capture the essence of real life Formula One racing who provided real-life motion captures, feedback from key members of the race teams which became part of the game. The executive producer for the game John Rostron said \\"We wanted to stretch the boundaries of motor sports gaming and shake up the racing genre all together\\". The game utilizes the same Engine used in F1 Championship Season 2000. The developers made alterations to the physics model of the cars to make the cars to make them react better to minor collisions and changes in the track surface. For track modelling, the reflections from buildings situated around the circuits were designed to be more realistic. The shadow code was rewritten allowing increased contrast to the shadows of objects. A new dynamic shadow system was added to move the location of a shadow which was dependent on the sun's position for weather changes. One major problem discovered upon release was that the graphics on the PC version would become distorted if newer computer drivers were used, thus rendering the game unplayable. EA Sports released a patch to combat the graphics issue along with fixes in compatibility in video cards. A port was planned for the Game Boy Color but was cancelled before release. =Promotion= Between 16 and 19 July 2001, EA held an event at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track that saw Ricardo Zonta race against the game's producers. On 25 July another event called Camp EA 2001 held at Redwood Shores featured all of the latest games including F1 2001 on display. IGN viewed a demo of the game at the event and praised the game for its smooth quality and fun playing style which was down to some of the developers who had worked on Quake III Arena. As a sign of good faith, BAR carried the EA Sports logo on their cars at the 2001 United States Grand Prix. The Xbox version debuted at a pre-ECTS event in September 2001. Teams and drivers All teams and drivers are based on the 2001 Formula One season teams and drivers lineup. Pedro de la Rosa was featured in this game, but was not featured in the PS1 and European PS2 versions of Formula One 2001 and F1 Career Challenge for the 2001 season mode. Soundtrack The game included the songs Sunstroke, The Drive Home and a remix of Nagasaki Badger by Chicane which are played on the main menu screens. Reception The game received \\"favourable\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the PlayStation 2 version was ported for release on 20 September 2001, Famitsu gave it a score of 28 out of 40. Peer Schneieder of IGN called the Xbox version \\"a barely enhanced but still enjoyable Formula One racing experience\\". Ralph Edwards noted in the PS2 review that Formula One games were a \\"hard sell in the United States\\" but praised Electronic Arts commitment to appeal to Formula One enthusiasts. GameSpot nominated the game as one of its nominees for Driving Game of the Year for 2001. Olivier Panis tested the game at the 2001 Japanese Grand Prix and commented that the game was close to real life Formula One Racing. In May 2012, the game along with the rest of the EA F1 series was rated the 4th greatest Formula One gaming series by readers of the website RaceFans winning 8% of the vote.

The club was founded in 1919 by the Germans of Maribor and was the five-time runner-up of the Ljubljana Subassociation League. History In late 1918, the first aspirations of founding a new German football club in Maribor have arisen. In March 1919, Sportvereinigung Rapid was officially founded with Franz Rueß becoming the first club president. When the Football Association of Yugoslavia was founded in April 1919, Rapid became one of the first clubs to join the association. After one year, Rueß resigned and was replaced by Walter Thalmann, who in January 1920 signed a contract with the Maribor's city authorities to obtain a football field at the Ljudski vrt area for the next ten years. After the thorough renovations, the new pitch was opened on 9 May 1920 in a match between Rapid and Slovan, which Slovan won 4–2. In the inaugural season of the Ljubljana Subassociation League in 1920, Rapid finished as runners-up behind Ilirija from Ljubljana. In the next few years (1921 to 1924), Rapid always finished behind their city rivals I. SSK Maribor in the Maribor subdivision, and therefore failed to qualify for the play-offs. However, in the next three seasons, Rapid reached the final again, but lost to Ilirija on all three occasions. In 1927, the club was affected by financial problems and was almost disbanded. A year later, Rapid moved to the newly built Poljane Sports Complex; the reason why Rapid left the Ljudski vrt area, despite having a ten- year rental agreement, is unknown. In the 1932–33 season, Rapid once again finished as runners-up of the league behind I. SSK Maribor. During the World War II, Rapid competed in the Styrian league competitions organised by the Nazi Germany, and was disbanded after the war when the German Army left Maribor. The club played in black and blue kits with stripes.

Harassment = Form = Harassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests. In some cases, female players are also stalked, whether online or offline. Women are sometimes marginalized as \\"intruders\\", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as the Sims, music video games or casual games. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing \\"girl games\\" or disliking violent games. As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or game developers, even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game. Since the release of the NES, video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men. In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads. Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported sexual harassment in the workplace. According to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that women claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion. In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to \\"meetings\\" that were actually romantic dates. Sexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.Digitized Lives, T.V. Reed Video games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as 'booth babes', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues. One form of harassment involves perpetrators changing their username to include sexist or racially charged language when they leave comments during live-streams, according to gamer Amira Virgil. = Frequency = Insults are frequent in online gaming. According to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service Xbox Live), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment. However, data from Riot Games lists racism and homophobia as the top problems. Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming. In 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing Halo 3 online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile. A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less-skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers. The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males \\"attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.\\" A study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words \\"gay\\" or \\"queer\\" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as \\"somewhat hostile\\" while 14% perceived it as \\"very hostile\\". According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should \\"return to the kitchen\\", along with other slurs. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry. Critics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women. =The #MeToo impact on the video game industry= In October 2017 the #MeToo movement highlighted sexual harassment allegations against several important and high- profile figures from predominately the entertainment industry. In response to a growing number of claims of harassment, several important figures in games media or publishing made public statements outlining their thoughts on how more needed to be done within the industry to do better when dealing with harassment including Jennifer MacLean, Executive Director of the International Game Developers Association, and Kate Edwards, the former Director, Joe Smedley of Sony Online Entertainment and Mike Wilson of Devolver Digital. The IGDA meanwhile published a public statement criticising \\"The prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in our community\\" and demanding \\"action from every game developer to ensure the safety and support of all of our colleagues and community members. We all must do a better job of welcoming, and protecting, all game developers so that our community, craft, and industry can thrive.\\" While some commentators called for action throughout the industry to call out toxic behaviour, Brianna Wu, who had been one of those targeted during the Gamergate controversy, argued from her experience that the video game industry did not have a system in place to support those women that came forward, thus favoring silence on such matters. In January 2018 following a public outcry the Game Developers Conference rescinded a Pioneer Award to Nolan Bushnell after revelations about early Atari meetings being held in hot tubs, amongst other claims. While the decision was criticised in some parts, including by some of the leading women at Atari during that period in time, Bushnell himself supported the decision and applauded the \\"GDC for ensuring that their institution reflects what is right, specifically with regards to how people should be treated in the workplace\\". In a January 2018 an opinion piece in The Guardian, journalist Keza McDonald speculated that the video game industry would have a similar \\"#MeToo moment\\", but was not currently ready. McDonald highlighted a few instances of action being taken but noted that \\"there has been no mass movement of women coming forward with their stories of workplace harassment\\", and suggested that the harassment of individuals associated with #1reasonwhy and #Gamergate deterred women from opening themselves \\"up to further harassment, victim-blaming, and unpleasant professional ramifications\\". In August 2019, following Nathalie Lawhead coming forward with sexual assault accusations against Jeremy Soule, several other women and non-binary people brought additional accusations of sexual assault, harassment, and abuse against members of the industry, including some whose reports had been generally overlooked in the past. A number of industry members established a \\"Times Up\\" group to encourage other women to speak up about events in their past. Anita Sarkeesian stated that this may be the expected #MeToo moment for the industry. A similar wave of sexual harassment and misconduct accusations occurred in June 2020. Initial claims were made against one of the popular Destiny 2 players on Twitch by several women on June 19, 2020, accusing this player of inappropriate conduct in both online and offline behavior. This led to at least seventy women involved in the industry to speak out on other Twitch streamers who had engaged in similar inappropriate behavior, including one directed at Omeed Dariani, the CEO of Online Performers Group, a talent agency that represents many Twitch streamers. Dariani apologized for his past behavior and subsequently stepped down. Twitch was also criticized for allowing such behavior to occur, and the service said it would begin to evaluate all reported incidents and work with law enforcement as necessary. The event led to other accusations of past misconducted to be raised against various members of the video game industry and other closely related markets, including freelance writer Chris Avellone, CEO of Cards Against Humanity Max Temkin (who resigned following the allegations), Wizards of the Coast artist Noah Bradley (who was terminated following the accusations), and Ubisoft creative director Ashraf Ismail (who stepped down from his position to deal with his personable matters). Both Ubisoft and Insomniac Games also addressed additional claims of their employees being accused of sexual harassment and stated they would take these accusations seriously and investigate the matters internally. Charges were made toward the CEO of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), Joey Cuellar, who was subsequently let go. Multiple publishers that had backed the event had pulled out on this news, and the EVO event, which had already been reworked as an online event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was subsequently cancelled. =Examples= Events in 2007 to 2017 brought sexual harassment in video gaming to mainstream media's attention in the United-States, United Kingdom and Germany: * In 2007, Kathy Sierra, a technology blogger, was forced to move her household after receiving repeated rape threats and death threats and then having her home address published online and packages sent to her home in an attempt to spook her. She feared for her safety so much that she canceled her speaking engagements and stopped writing and blogging. *In February 2012, the behavior of a Tekken team coach against a female player of his team during a Capcom competition named Cross Assault provoked an outrage. He interrogated her about her bra size, asked her to remove her shirt, took a webcam to film her breasts and her legs, smelled her and discussed her appearance during the live broadcast of the tournament on the internet. He then stated that sexual harassment and the fighting game community are \\"one and the same thing\\" and that it would be \\"ethically wrong\\" to remove sexual harassment from the community. After a few days without any reaction from the sponsoring company, the female player eventually gave up the competition. Capcom later issued an apology and stated that \\"any inappropriate or disrespectful comments will not be tolerated during filming\\". The team coach also apologized afterwards. *In May 2012, the Kickstarter crowdfunding of videos on female representation in video games received wide coverage due to the cyber-bullying of its founder, the feminist video-blogger Anita Sarkeesian. Her Facebook, YouTube and email accounts were subsequently flooded with hateful and sexist comments, death and rape threats, and photoshopped pictures of her getting raped by video game characters. A game was created, inviting players to beat her up. She eventually collected $160,000 out of the requested $6,000. The most recent threat against Anita Sarkeesian was in Logan, Utah, on October 15, 2014. She was scheduled to deliver a speech on a Wednesday evening until an anonymous email message arrived a day before, stating that there would be a mass shooting if the event was held. *In France, the female blogger Mar_Lard brought attention to the sexism in the video gaming community in May 2013 by publishing a blog post named Sexisme chez les geeks: Pourquoi notre communauté est malade, et comment y remédier, a compilation of sexism problems in the geek community. * Parts of the writing of the 2016 video game Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear attracted controversy and resulted in hateful and sexist harassment to the developers, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchase reporting that criticism focused on two scenes perceived as pushing a political agenda. The first is the character Minsc's quip, \\"Really, it's about ethics in heroic adventuring\\", a reference to the Gamergate controversy. The second is an optional dialogue tree in which the cleric Mizhena mentions that she was raised as a boy, indicating that she is a trans woman. Colin Campbell of Polygon reported that writer Amber Scott faced online harassment and insults and that the game's Steam and GOG pages were bombarded with complaints that the transgender reference constituted \\"political correctness,\\" \\"LGBT tokenism\\" and \\"SJW pandering.\\" Scott said she wanted to address elements in the original Baldur's Gate that she considered sexist, including its depictions of Safana as a \\"sex object\\" and Jaheira as a \\"nagging wife\\" played for comedy. She had previously commented: \\"I get to make decisions about who I write about and why. I don't like writing about straight/white/cis people all the time. It's not reflective of the real world, it sets up s/w/c as the 'normal' baseline from which 'other' characters must be added, and it's boring.\\" *In November 2017, the cosplayer Christine Sprankle announced that she was quitting Magic: the Gathering cosplay due to persistent harassment. In a Twitter post, she named MtGHeadquarters/UnsleevedMedia as having made her \\"life hell this whole year\\". In response, Wizards of the Coast posted a tweet saying they are \\"saddened\\", and that the bullying and harassment is \\"unacceptable\\". Additionally, many professional Magic players posted an open letter in support of Sprankle and in criticism of the harassment. Jeremy Hambly, the accused, remarked that Wizards of the Coast may likely issue a ban that would affect his ability to play Magic Online among other formats. *One of the White, female players answer in a forum post that she had experiences of sexism during an online game. When she said in voice chat during the game, \\"the sniper is in the bottom corner in the bushes under the Tower,\\" one of the male players in the game called her names that look down on women. The female player only can play with mute mode so that she does not have to listen, and her mic stays off most of the time. *One Black, female player told in an interview that sometimes if you tag looks too feminine or if you use voice chat, they'll kick you out of the game. *Another Latina, female player answered the interview. She said that during online games, men would send her pictures of things she didn't want to see, or they would harass her. Moreover, one of her experiences is that the other players would say she was a guy playing under a girl's name just because she played well in the game. She was hesitant to jump into multiplayer and practiced by herself before going online. And once she was online, she would generally have a good time and dominate the public leaderboards, but the gamer is almost universally assumed to be a 'he,' People would compliment her like, 'hey well-done bro, hey dude, do this.' she said that they are just using male language to address her. She has never bothered to correct it because when she did, it would spark a whole unwanted conversation. She also stopped talking on her mic because the other players would sexually harass her such as to ask her phone number. *Kuznekoff and Rose were studying about sexism in online video. They played a networked violent game with other anonymous players and interacted with them using male or female pre-recorded voices. the female voice received three times the amount of negative comments that the male voice received *Leena van Deventer, award-winning game developer, writer and lecturer at RMIT, shared an experience while playing \\"Team Fortress 2,\\" an online multiplayer shooter game. She had changed her headphone and mic setting with an exciting feature that made her sound like a robot or a giant. Once she began speaking in-game, however, there was what she calls \\"the reaction\\" that happened when the other players realize women play an online game. One man continued to \\"stalk\\" her avatar in the game. Then came questions such as \\"what are you wearing?\\"\\"have you got any pics?\\" \\"have you got any NUDE pics?\\" \\"Do you fuck guys who like games?\\" Other teammate found it hilarious. She said she wished she could focus other objective in the game, but she knew she had to leave this server. Then as her computer mouse was hovering over the exit button when she heard him climax, moaning her username into his microphone.  Effects  A study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due to the Proteus effect, manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a virtual reality game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher rape myth acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that blame the victim, and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased self-objectification. When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women. In 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar. In another study, 181 students from a private liberal arts college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to control group), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance. A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games. Karen E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely. Theories such as the cultivation theory, social cognitive theory, ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media. These theories also illustrate the ways prominent video game characters are gendered and what is received by the user or viewer. They write that \\"Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens.\\" According to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player. On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as \\"hi everybody\\" or \\"alright team let's do this\\" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice. In 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres. The longitudinal study was based on cultivation theory, and the results broadly showed that playing video games did not lead to gamers becoming sexist. The authors Johannes Breuer, Rachel Kowert, Ruth Festl and Thorsten Quandt have, however, been keen \\"to make clear that [their] study does not show that sexism is not an issue in/for games and gaming culture. There are many content analyses of popular games that show that female characters are underrepresented or presented in an overly sexualized manner and there is also ample evidence that many players, particularly female, have experienced sexism in their interactions with other players.\\" A study published in May 2016 investigated the common perception of a gender performance gap. The researchers analysed the performance data of over 10,000 players (both men and women) in the online MMORPGs Everquest II in the United States and Chevaliers III in China. The study contends that \\"perceived gender- based performance disparities seem to result from factors that are confounded with gender (i.e., amount of play), not player gender itself\\". Lead author Cuihai Shen stated that if there was a gender disparity favoring men then \\"they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time\\" however their analysis indicated \\"women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games\\". Shen outlined that there was a difference in play style between the genders, and stated \\"women did spend less time playing overall than men, they chose characters that are more assistive, and were more drawn to social interaction and helping others. In their 2016 analysis of female characters in video games, Lynch, Tompkins, van Driel, & Fritz looked at the frequency of females in lead roles, secondary roles, as well as the level of sexualization of the female characters. They found that from 1992 to 2006 that far more females characters were in secondary roles to that of lead roles, as well as being at higher rates of sexualization. However, from 2007 to 2014, they found that there was a decrease in the sexualization and objectification of females characters in video games, with an influx of positive characteristics such as female characters being portrayed as strong, capable, and attractive, as well as giving these women more character development. These aspects they suspect may attract more women to get into playing video games. In a study by Tang & Fox in 2016, they looked at if there was any correlation between men's personality and contextual factors and if these factors could predict the men's behaviors and the types of harassment these men would employ as they played video games. Their study found that the men who were categorized as showing signs of being socially dominant and hostile sexism carried out acts of verbal sexual harassment, such as \\"making sexist comments and joking about rape.\\" These same men were also found to also executed general harassment, such as \\"swearing at a player or insulting their intelligence or skill,\\" and that general harassment was found more often in those who also showed signs of being involved in the game and those who played games on a weekly basis. In a 2016 study conducted by Kaye & Pennington, they ultimately propose that the gaming industry should start to integrate systems that promote more positive forms of socializing between the players, provide the ability for players to work on cooperative tasks with other groups while being a part of their own, and that changes like these could help lessen the negative and hostile attitudes that female players face regularly, concluding that these efforts would help reduce the rate at which these hostile behaviors happen. According to Paaßen, Morgenroth, and Stratemeyer in their 2017 article, they compared how often men identified as gamers compared to that of women. They found that men were more likely to publicly identify as gamers while females felt compelled to either identify as either as female or as a gamer. This led to their conclusion that these findings reinforce the stereotypes that women cannot be gamers and how that this is certainly detrimental to females who identify themselves as gamers, as women already have negative experiences in the professional spheres of video game culture, especially when compared to that of their male counterparts. In a study by Read, Lynch, and Matthews in 2018, it was found that men who played as sexualized avatars showed reduced rates of hostile sexism, and that for both men and women it was found that their levels of rape myth acceptance (RMA) was also reduced.  Countermeasures  Female activists actively promote changes in the way women are portrayed in games and how they are treated by the industry and gaming public as a whole. Media critic Anita Sarkeesian, for example, has – through her organization Feminist Frequency – given lectures and training to help change gaming culture. A prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of TIGA, \\"typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low. There is only a comparatively small pool of potential female employees available to work in the games industry.\\" Initiatives on the part of gaming companies include codes of conduct and the adoption of trainings and standards to ensure safe and respectful workplace. In an attempt to combat sexism, the French government in 2016 proposed pieces of legislation that would give bonuses or incentives to video game creators that promote a more positive image of female characters in their games. Furthermore, these proposals outline a rating system that distinguishes games that promote a positive female representation and those that do not, with the latter getting the highest age 18 rating.

Mirchi was often called the drug baron for his thriving narcotics business across Asia, Africa and Europe, according to various media articles. Memon's family originally owned shops selling chillies and spices and thus he got the nickname 'Mirchi'. Mirchi's fortunes soared after he began smuggling in banned meth tablets, heroin and Mandrax. He also owned a disco called The Fisherman's Wharf at Worli seafront in Mumbai which was a hotbed for narcotics. In May 1986, Mirchi was first nabbed by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in connection with the seizing of 600 kg of heroin — valued at around Rs 9 crore — from a farmhouse in Thane. However, prosecutors could not link Mirchi with the farmhouse and he was let off. When the heat became too much, Mirchi left India in late 1980s first to Dubai and later to London. The front for all his businesses in the UK was a rice mill called Eden Fine Rice. He was first arrested by Interpol in London in April 1995, following a red corner notice for his arrest issued by the CBI. An extradition request was made on the basis that Mirchi was wanted for ordering a murder, and was the prime suspect in two drug seizure cases. However, in 1999, all investigations of Iqbal Mirchi were called off for lack of evidence. The Indian government also lost its extradition proceedings against Mirchi. Mirchi always claimed that he was a victim of persecution, and that all the allegations against him were unfounded and biased. In an interview with the Guardian Newspaper in London, Mirchi maintained his stance, explaining that was how he won his extradition proceedings. Mirchi also denied being associated with Dawood Ibrahim in any way. In addition, Mirchi claimed he was a \\"law-abiding person with no convictions,\\" and that he was \\"being victimised for being a successful businessman\\". On 1 June 2004, he was sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Though many allegations were produced in the media against Mirchi, he was never formally charged or convicted of any crime. Mirchi died in 2013 of a heart attack in London at age 63. In April 2016, Mirchi was named in the Panama papers for stashing black money in foreign bank accounts. Personal life Iqbal Mirchi has two sons Asif and Junaid from his first wife Hajira Memon amd they live in the United Kingdom. His second wife is Heena Kausar, a small time actress and the daughter of the famous film- maker K. Asif (producer-director of the epic Mughal-e-Azam) by his second wife Nigar Sultana also lives in the United Kingdom.

Cruz Bay Publishing, 2013. Web. 10 Aug. 2013. Extended Side Angle Pose, is an asana in modern yoga as exercise. It involves using many essential muscle groups: legs, ankles, groin, chest, lungs, shoulders, spine, and the abdomen.  Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words utthita meaning \\"extended\\", parsva meaning \\"side or flank\\", kona meaning \\"angle\\", and asana meaning \\"posture or seat\\". The pose is not mentioned in medieval hatha yoga texts. It appears in the 20th century in Krishnamacharya's school of yoga in Mysore, and in the teaching of his pupils Pattabhi Jois and B. K. S. Iyengar, along with other asanas with names that describe the position of the body and its limbs. Description The pose is entered from Tadasana; the legs are spread wide apart, the feet are turned out as for Trikonasana and the arms are stretched out sideways. One knee is bent to a right angle and the hand on that side is placed on the floor just behind the foot. The upper arm is then stretched in line with the body straight out, above the ear. Variations Parivritta Parsvakonasana A twisting asana, Parivritta Parsvakonasana (reversed side angle pose), is obtained by reversing the direction of turn of the thorax. The opposite elbow is brought to the forward knee; this is a useful preparatory pose. In the full pose, the hand is brought to the floor on the outside of the front foot, and the other hand is stretched forwards in line with the body over the head, with the gaze directed upwards.

Life  Werner has described his childhood in the small town in south Moravia as idyllic. His father was a ‘master-baker’ and ran a small confectionery shop, and his mother was originally a qualified cook. The idyll ended when in 1933 their house was sold in an auction as a result of arrears in mortgage repayments during the great depression. The family then moved to Znojmo, a district town, not far from the Austrian borders. Here Werner started his secondary education in the local grammar school (called reálné gymnasium) which was interrupted by the incorporation of Znojmo into the ‘Sudetenland’ after the Munich 'agreement' in 1938. He continued his studies in Brno, but could not undergo final, so-called ‘maturity’, examinations, because of restrictions imposed by the German occupation authorities in the closing years of the war. He passed them after the war in the liberated Czechoslovakia in autumn 1945 and enrolled in the Philosophical Faculty of the Masaryk University in Brno, reading philosophy and history and studying Sanskrit and classical Chinese from textbooks. He was earmarked for the post of assistant in the Philosophy Department headed by Professor J. L. Fischer who, upon being appointed Rector of Palacký University in Olomouc, asked him to follow him. Here he was given the opportunity to study classical Chinese under Professor Jaroslav Průšek and to perfect his Sanskrit under Professor Vincenc Lesný, who accepted him as his assistant when, after the communist putsch of February 1948, Marxist philosophy became dominant and Werner could not hope to pursue the career in comparative philosophy which J. L. Fischer had originally foreseen for him. He gained his PhD, having defended his thesis on a semantological analysis of primitive languages and passed the rigorous examinations in philosophy and Indian philology in May 1949. He also took state examinations in philosophy and history as a qualification entitling him to teach in gymnasiums. In autumn 1950 Werner was entrusted with lectures on the comparative grammar of Sanskrit and on the History of India and published his first academic paper abroad. He was also asked to give a course in the history of ancient Middle East, but was criticised for failing to apply to it the Marxist method of historical and dialectical materialism. He was also investigated by the Secret police for his contacts with foreign visitors. In autumn 1951 Oriental Studies in Olomouc were closed down. Prof. Lesný’s request for Werner’s transfer to Charles University in Prague was turned down for political reasons and he was dismissed at a fortnight’s notice. His own application for a teaching post in a gymnasium was turned down for the same reasons. In the chaos created by the communist government during the wholesale nationalisation of industry and commerce Werner found a job in an enterprise newly created for building roads and railways. One of his tasks was to produce detailed descriptions of work done by technical staff, which placed him in the category of technical (rather than administrative) clerks and this became the designation of his occupation entered in his identity card. When a year later he had to begin his two-year military service, he was given only the most basic training and became, as a ‘technician’, the assistant of the regimental caretaker-cum-quartermaster (1952–54). (After the purge of ‘bourgeois’ officers, the newly commissioned substitutes of working-class origin needed, owing to their lack of competence, the unofficial but tolerated help of educated soldiers who for political reasons were not deemed fit for officer training. After his military service, Werner did not get his previous job back, but was transferred, in a similar capacity, to the headquarters of the nationalised enterprise overseeing restaurants and canteens. A year later (1955) he lost even this job to a communist party member and after a short training period worked as a restaurant manager (1956–60). Time permitting, Werner continued his studies and published articles on indological topics in England, West Germany, India and Sri Lanka. It was a time of court proceedings against suspected anticommunist dissidents who were often sentenced on trumped-up charges. Werner’s foreign contacts led to his being investigated by the secret police on suspicion of belonging to a spy ring, passing messages abroad under the pretence of academic articles. No evidence was found and Werner withstood intimidating pressure to confess. No charges were brought against him.,Nyanaponika Thera, Jádro buddhistické meditace (The Heart of Buddhist Meditation), DharmaGaia, Praha, 1995, Translator’s Foreword, 12. but he was sent to work in a coal mine for one year and thereafter was allowed to work only in manual jobs - in gasworks (1961–64), as a plumber (1964) and as a tram driver (1964–67). The investigation by the secret police had a side effect. The restaurant Werner was in charge of was being transferred in his absence to a new manager. A substantial deficit was figured out in its accounts and Werner was accused of stealing state property. Before the court proceedings he was allowed to check the accounts and found faults in them. Their correction reduced the assumed deficit to an insignificant sum due probably to a still undiscovered fault. Nevertheless, the judge, one of those newly appointed from working-class cadres after six week training, who did not even allowed Werner to speak during the court ‘hearing’, found him guilty. However, the appeal judge, still from the old fully qualified ranks, acquitted him. After the loss of his academic position Werner came to appreciate some practical aspects of Indian teachings. He mastered the basic set of hatha yoga positions and procedures, adopted the practice of Buddhist meditation and headed a clandestine group of like-minded practitioners. He further entered into correspondence with foreign organisations and personalities, among them with the Buddhist Society in London, the Buddhist Publication Society in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and its editor Nyanaponika Thera, The Yoga Institute in Santa Cruz, Bombay and Lonavla, the Buddhistisches Seminar für Seinskunde, founded and conducted by Paul Debes from his isolated retreat in Lüneburger Heide near Hamburg, the Yoga Institute in Fulda, West Germany, founded by Dr Otto Albert Isbert, Mrs C. Walinski-Heller in Nürnberg, who had been in 1959 the Mother of Svami Shivanada’s ashram in Rishikesh, and the Order Ārya Maitreya Mandala (AMM) founded in India by Lama Anagarika Govinda and headed in West Germany by Dr. Karl-Heinz Gottmann. He made some written contributions to the publication activities of these organisations. At home he started contributing to the flourishing clandestine publication activities geared to spiritual practices by translating Buddhist texts and books. These circulated in typescript copies. When he discovered that members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences working in its Moscow headquarters were practicing hatha yoga positions as their obligatory morning exercises (introduced by a member who had learned them while doing some research in India), he used it to persuade a newspaper to publish his first illustrated article on hatha yoga. As a result, he was invited to give several lectures with demonstrations in Bratislava, Slovakia, with a television program (1963), and a year later he was allowed to repeat the lectures in Brno and several other towns in Moravia, Bohemia and Slovakia. The social club of the biggest factory in Brno then invited him to conduct courses in hatha yoga and enabled him to found The Yoga Club (1964) in which he was able to introduce cautiously some spiritual elements, such as meditation, under the heading of relaxation. This club continued to function under instructors trained by Werner even after his emigration in the wake of the Soviet invasion (1968) and still exists, now on an independent basis.Karel Werner, Hathajóga. Základy tělesných cvičení jógických, 3rd ed., CAD Press, Bratislava, 2009, 11-13. In 1966 a meeting for discussions was arranged for him in Halle (East Germany) with a pupil of Paul Debes from West Germany and here Werner also met Professor Heinz Mode, an expert on Buddhist sculpture of Sri Lanka and India, who knew of his activities. The same year he visited Budapest at the invitation of Dr Hetényi who headed the Hungarian branch of AMM and the so-called Institute of Buddhist Philosophy. He was also shown the healing methods in the internationally known Institute for physically and mentally handicapped children, founded and headed by Dr Petö who was achieving great results by special methods inspired by yoga and Daoist slow motion exercises in combination with the recitation of Tibetan mantras. Therapeutical effects of the hatha yoga practice were also demonstrated in Werner’s courses. A case in point was a member of the orchestra of the Brno opera who suffered from a serious psychosomatic condition which was causing him great embarrassment during long operatic acts. No medical, psychiatric or psychotherapeutical treatment he had undergone had cured him. In the end he was told by the chief district psychiatrist: “Go to that crazy Werner, maybe he will help you with his yoga.” His full recovery after only a few weeks had an unexpected effect. Werner was invited to lecture on ‘Oriental therapies’ in the yearly advanced training courses for psychiatrists and was appointed the editor of the Psychiatric Digest. His working place was the Psychiatric Institute in Kroměříž (1967–68), where he was engaged in a project researching the physiological processes during the practice of yoga and meditation and the possibilities of their therapeutic application. For that purpose he was personally subjected to the appropriate measurements of his bodily functions, which included the EEG of his brain activity, while assuming yogic positions and practising meditation. He was further training a team of doctors and nurses at the Institute in these activities. Werner was over the years receiving invitations from institutions in the West that he was in touch with to take part in seminars and conferences, and therefore he kept applying, for several years unsuccessfully, for a passport. In 1967 he obtained one and the director of the Psychiatric Institute granted him six weeks’ leave for a ‘study trip’ in West Germany. During this time he participated in international conference of yoga teachers, an internal seminar of the AMM held in the ‘House of Stillness’ (Hause der Stille) in Roseburg and was granted honorary membership of the Order of AMM. In the forest retreat of Paul Debes in Lüneburger Heide he held discussions with him, his helpers and pupils. He also visited Mrs Walinski-Heller, who outlined a plan to open a clinic for yoga therapy in Nürnberg in collaboration with the Kroměříž Institute, Werner acting as a go-between. (The plan was subsequently enthusiastically welcomed by the director in Kroměříž.) On the way back Werner was a guest of Professor Heinz Mode in Halle, spent some time in Leipzig where in the Indological Department of the University he met Dr Heinz Kucharski, who briefed him on the activities of their secret Yoga Association, and took part in reading Chinese Buddhist texts in the Sinological Department. In East Berlin he visited Professor J. H. Schultz, known as the author of ‘autogenic training’, a psychotherapeutic procedure inspired by the hathayoga method of relaxation. In January 1968 came the so-called ‘Prague Spring’ with Alexander Dubček, the new leader of the communist party, who initiated liberal reforms. Werner made an application to the Ministry of Education for his reinstatement into his academic appointment, but the reply was negative. Not even under ‘communism with a human face’, which is how Dubček described the system he aimed to introduce, was a non-party member allowed to teach humanities. Using the freer atmosphere in other ways, Werner brought his Yoga Club into the open and conducted his hatha yoga course in premises lent to the club by the Educational Department of Brno municipality. On 8 May he founded, with the assistance of Viennese Buddhists, the ‘Buddhist Circle of Czechoslovakia’.World Buddhism, July 1968, 325. However, the Soviet invasion of the country on 21 August 1968 put a stop to these activities. It also prevented Werner’s planned departure for England by air, to fulfill an invitation from the Buddhist Society in London to lecture at their Summer School that month. Taking advantage of the chaotic situation in towns which was tying down the invading army, while the borders remained manned by Czech guards, Werner crossed over to Bavaria two days after the invasion and arrived only a few days late in the Buddhist Summer School in England. He fulfilled his teaching assignment, but anticipating renewed oppression in his native country after the re-introduction of totalitarian government, which would inevitably lead to his further persecution, Werner decided to stay and settle in England. Here he was first employed in the Cambridge University Library and was also appointed as a supervisor in Sanskrit for Churchill College. In 1969 he won the appointment as Spalding Lecturer in Indian Philosophy and Religion in the School of Oriental Studies in the University of Durham, where he newly introduced courses in Sanskrit and also conducted courses in yoga and Indian civilisation for the University’s Extramural Department as well as for the University of Leeds. He again taught in the Summer School of the Buddhist Society and also in teacher training courses of the British Wheel of Yoga. In 1975 he founded annual academic Symposia in Indian religions which he conducted for ten years and which still continue under elected committees.http://spaldingsymposium.org/about-2/ In 2010 he returned to conduct the 35th symposium held in Oxford in honour of his 85th birthday.The Thirty-Fifth Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions In Honour of Professor Karel Werner’s Eighty-Fifth Birthday, Oxford, 2010, http://issuu.com/mehdizejnulahu/docs/spaldingcommemorativevolume/1In the years 1975-1976 he was a guest professor in the Peradeniya University in Kandy, Sri Lanka, in Karnataka State University in Dharwar and in Benares Hindu University in Varanasi. He gave occasional guest lectures in the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Lancaster, Manchester and Stirling. During his academic tenure Werner travelled extensively in Asian countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Japan. Werner’s retirement in 1990 coincided with the collapse of communist regimes and he was able to become active in his native country. The Society for Science and Art (Svaz pro vědu a umění), with headquarters in the USA and membership recruited from Czech and Slovak refugee academics around the World could hold its biennial conference for the first time in Prague and he was invited to chair its section on religions. Subsequently, in the years 1991-1993, he was a corresponding member of the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences and in the years 1993-1998 he was professor in the Masaryk University of Brno, in the Institute for the Study of Religions, which he helped to found (replacing the abolished Institute of Atheistic Studies of the communist era). In the years 1991-1993 he was several times the guest lecturer for the Swan Hellenic travel agency on tours through India, Nepal, Cambodia and Vietnam. In 1999 he visited South Korea for the first time and in the years 2002-2007 he became a guest professor in the Institute of Buddhist Studies of the Dongkuk University in Seoul and Kyeongju. Since 1993 he has been an honorary professorial Research Associate in the Department of the Study of Religions, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. He is a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society (FRAS) and of the Temenos Academy (FTA). Werner had left his country legally after the Soviet invasion, on his still valid passport. Subsequently he was granted, through the Czechoslovak Embassy in London, a temporary permission to reside abroad. But his application for permanent permission was refused by the Ministry of Interior in Prague in December 1969 and he thus became an illegal emigrant. His first marriage ended in divorce, and he remarried at the end of 1970. In due course he acquired British citizenship. He lived with his wife in London.  Work  Werner’s research was directed to the collections of Vedic hymns, particularly those which contain philosophical ideas or can be construed as anticipating the beginnings of yoga, and to the question of their possible origin in Indo- European antiquity. He has been further preoccupied with the evolution of yogic and Buddhist spiritual practices and with the topic of rebirth or reincarnation in Indian teachings and in European thought. In this context he repeatedly turned his attention to the problem of the nature of the transmigrating personality in the Vedas, Upanishads and Buddhism. During his spell in the Philosophical Faculty of Masaryk University he was directed to produce broad surveys of the main religious traditions of Asia, and these were published as two books by the University for students and later in revised form for the public by a commercial publishing house which, besides, commissioned him to write a book on Jainism to be published towards the end of 2013. In the academic year 2012/13 SOAS inaugurated a new MA course, in Traditions of Yoga and Meditation, and Werner was invited to give the keynote lecture during its first session. He was further commissioned by a commercial publishing house to write A History of Yoga.  Religious and philosophical outlook  Werner was raised as a Roman Catholic and in the years 1934-1937 he was a server in the Dominican monastery in Znojmo and a member of the order Legio angelica. At the beginning of his secondary education in 1936 (in the so-called real gymnasium lasting eight years) he declared priesthood as the goal of his studies, but within two years, having experienced substantial expansion of his mental horizon through his studies based on the gymnasium’s excellent curriculum, he lost his religious faith. After two further years of intellectual ‘drifting’ he discovered books about Oriental religions and decided to study philosophy and comparative religion in the hope of becoming better able to understand questions relating to the nature of existence and its possible goal. He conceives philosophy in the Socratic way as a search for the meaning of life, although he is aware that it can never be fully known. But philosophy can point to a direction in which to look and clarify the preconditions, one of them being the necessity of observing ethical principles. Philosophy can therefore enable one to “live in the direction of the meaning of life”, which was a phrase coined by Robert Konečný, his first teacher of philosophy in 1945 at the Masaryk University in Brno.Náboženské tradice Asie I & II, Werner concedes that the gist of the teachings of the Buddha, as it is deducible from his discourses in the Pāli Canon, is closest to his own thinking. The discourses appeal to him by their rationality and by methodical descriptions of meditative practices, but he does not regard himself as a ‘believing Buddhist’; he points out that embracing a faith absolutely often leads astray as has been and still is repeatedly demonstrated by religious orthodoxies. This is true also of rigidly held scientific theories, including biological materialism, such as the one advocated by Richard Dawkins,Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion, Random House, London, 2009 (1st ed. Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 2006) but he accepts the validity of his arguments against the existence of an almighty and all-knowing god creator. In place of faith or acceptance of scientific theories, if they deny the possibility of the existence of transcendental dimensions of reality because there is no objective proof for them, he applies the philosophical concept of ‘logical probability’. To monotheism and ‘scientific’ materialism, when held as ‘world views’, he ascribes a very small, if any, measure of logical probability. But to soberly understood principles and arguments contained in the Buddha’s discourses he is inclined to accord a very large measure of logical probability and regards them as suitable guidelines for living ‘in the direction of the meaning of life’. He is aware that adherents of Buddhism, and especially Theravāda monks, often accept and interpret Buddhism on the basis of their belief in the literal validity of the Buddha’s reported words and sometimes even try to support them by assertions or indications of their personal experience. But Werner maintains a reserved attitude and provisionally accepts only what is supported by his own experience and reflection. He thinks that in this respect he follows the advice contained in the most often quoted discourse of the Buddha.An,.guttara Nikāya I, 189-193 (PTS text edition); The Book of Gradual Sayings I, (PTS translation), Luzac, London, 1951, 173-175; cf. Soma, Kālāma sutta, BPS Kandy, 1959; repr. in Nyanaponika Thera, The Road to Inner Freedom, BPS Kandy, 1982.  Political views  After the loss of his religious faith - during the two years of intellectual ‘drifting’ - Werner tentatively approached Marxism under the influence of his elder brother, but he soon turned away from it as a result of reading the works of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and became a convinced opponent of communism. After the war he joined the renewed Czech National Social Party (founded in 1897) with a liberal centre stage programme and became the chairman of its student branch in the Philosophical Faculty of the Masaryk University in Brno, with a prospect of being selected as a candidate for the parliament in the elections planned for June 1948. However, disillusioned somewhat by internal problems within the party, he did not continue his political activities in Olomouc and concentrated on his studies which saved him from becoming immediately a victim of the ‘purge’ after the communist putsch in February 1948. In emigration, already as a British citizen, he became active in the fight for preserving democracy threatened by militant trade unions and became the founder-chairman of the North-Eastern branch of the Freedom Association, canvassing for the abolition of the ‘closed shop’. He regards the European Union as a costly structural analogy of the defunct Soviet Union and sees it as being ruled by an unelected clique and an enormous bureaucracy, with an impotent Parliament, internal corruption and opaque accounting. He remembers that the original vote of the British people for joining the European Economic Community was achieved only on the basis of fraudulent canvassing which kept from public knowledge the fact that the EEC was, according to the Treaty of Rome, just a transitional stage in the process of achieving ‘ever closer union’, culminating in full political unification. Werner therefore became a member of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) as soon as it was founded. He regards the ecological program of the EU as lacking scientific justification and sees it as accompanied by financial scheming and dishonest attempts to tamper with computer simulations forecasting global warming. He criticises successive governments for erratic immigration policy and lack of provisions for the integration of large immigrant communities, promoting instead a ‘multicultural’ society which does not work. He regards legislation which redefines the concept of marriage to include homosexual partnerships as guilty of logical contradiction which is, strictly speaking, outside the province of the legislative process. It can never meet with global and unquestioned human approval. During a few initial visits after the so-called ‘velvet revolution’ in his native country, Werner experienced insulting treatment even in official institutions as a ‘post- August (i.e. post the Soviet invasion in August 1968) emigrant’, when exploring the possibility of acquiring a house in case he would return to live there. He thus became acutely aware that Václav Havel was initially made the head of state by the decision of the Presidium of the communist party via the unanimous vote of the communist parliament in exchange for a smooth transition without reprisals. That parliament of course originated in the forceful seizure of power by the communist party in 1948 under Soviet supervision and was thus illegal. As a result, no de-communisation (which would parallel German de-nazification after the war) took place and the communist party was allowed to continue existing and carrying on in political life, in spite of its horrendous crimes during the time of the dictatorship. Many high positions in politics, the judiciary and economy remained in the hands of communists; only some of them left the party or publicly distanced themselves from its past. Victims of communist persecution and returning political refugees found themselves cut off from opportunities or greatly disadvantaged. Werner resents that a moral regeneration in the political life of the country has not taken place. Many politicians lack personal integrity, even honesty. Corruption and cynical attitudes among them are on the increase which results in general disillusionment with politics reflected in low participation in elections. All these reasons made Werner reconsider his initial inclination to settle down again in his native country, which his English wife was willing to accept.

One of Pentheus' soldiers arrives and Dionysus (pretending to be one of his own priests, rather than the god himself) allows himself to be arrested and taken to Pentheus. A shepherd arrives to tell Pentheus of the behaviour of the maenads and Pentheus' mother Agave, especially their superhuman strength when attacked. Pentheus announces his wish to see the Dionysian rites and is disguised as a woman. After watching for a while, he is ripped to shreds by the maenads, led by Agave. She describes her meeting with Echion and the conception and birth of Pentheus, before she is turned into a snake by Dionysus in vengeance for her treatment of his mother Semele. =Subplots= The main plot is also interwoven with four shorter plays.

The play touches on some of the issues surrounding the feminist ideals of the late nineteenth-century New Woman including female bicycle- riding, equal education rights, sexual autonomy, and political enfranchisement. The play was developed during 2012 at the National Theatre Studio and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.https://actors.mandy.com/uk/events.php?uid=1274 Its first full production ran at Shakespeare's Globe from 24 August to 11 October 2013.

The play can be staged with approximately twelve actors.  Synopsis  =Prologue= It is 1896. Dr Maudlsey begins with a warning to the audience that education for women is a dangerous idea. He argues that women's lives should be determined by their biological and reproductive functions, and therefore, they should not enter into an intellectual race with men at university. Simultaneously, Mrs Elizabeth Welsh, head of Girton College, Cambridge welcomes the new female students to the college for commencement. =Act One= Tess Moffat arrives to an exterior Cambridge location wearing bloomers without a skirt. She meets her fellow Girton students who are similarly attired: Maeve, Celia and Carolyn. Maeve is from a working-class family but because of her extraordinary talent, and sponsorship from Lady Beaumont, she is able to attend the college. Carolyn is an early bohemian, well-travelled and wealthy. Celia is a cautious student concerned with being a positive representation of Girton College. They have been assembled for Mr Banks's special lecture on the laws of motion otherwise known as learning to ride a bicycle. Banks encourages debate and challenge from them. Tess rides off. In another exterior location, the Trinity boys are watching Tess riding the bicycle from afar. Ralph is especially taken with the sight of a woman sitting astride, whilst Holmes and Lloyd are horrified at the impropriety. Will Bennett (whom we learn later is from Tess's town and has been asked by her father to look out for her) is careful to express no opinion. Miss Blake teaches the female students moral science. The question is on the nature of happiness: is it self-knowledge, self-abnegation, or self-determination? Miss Blake encourages them to work hard, to be exceptional, to think for themselves, all in aid of advancing the cause of women's rights to graduate. The boys assemble to hear a lecture by the eminent physician, Dr Maudsley. The arrival of the women causes a stir. Dr Maudsley arrives to lecture about female hysteria, his own opinion being that women have inferior moral strength caused by a weaker mind and will. As he lectures he repeatedly ignores the female students until Tess can bear no more and challenges him. Maudsley takes this as evidence of female hysteria and demands that she leave the lecture. She rushes out into the street. Whilst her female colleagues are sympathetic, Holmes and Lloyd are furious with Tess for interrupting the lecture. Will Bennet learns of Tess's trouble and the other boys realise that Will knows Tess. Later, in Mrs Welsh's office, Tess is persuaded to be more diplomatic for the sake of the progress of the female right to graduate. In the library, Ralph sends a secret invitation to Tess to meet him later in the orchard. Tess evades her chaperone, Miss Bott to attend the rendezvous. In his seduction routine, Ralph recites in Italian an excerpt from the sonnet, Provedi, saggio, ad esta visïone by Dante da Maiano which he does not understand. Tess is, nevertheless, taken with him. He kisses her hand and they agree to meet again. Having been turned away from yet another lecture, and having insisted that science is superior to the arts, Miss Blake threatens not to teach the women anymore. However, an impassioned response by Maeve changes Miss Blake's mind. Maeve's brother, Billy arrives at the college. He insists on taking Maeve home. Their mother has died, and the younger siblings need a woman to care for them. Maeve does not want to give up her education or her promise of a future as a teacher. However, Mrs Welsh, fearing that Maeve's story would be ammunition for those who claim that women's education threatens family life, tells Maeve that she must leave Girton. Maeve is crushed. Miss Blake challenges Mrs Welsh about her decision, but she counters by warning Miss Blake not to promote suffrage in the college. The injustice of Maeve's situation inspires Tess to write a new essay on a scientific explanation for the Star of Bethlehem. Mr Banks recommends Tess's essay to the boys who could learn from its originality and passion. Mrs Welsh address the Cambridge Senate to appeal for a vote on the issue of granting degrees to women. This action is shown simultaneously with Maeve leaving Girton. =Act Two= January 1897. Professors Radleigh, Anderson and Collins offer Mr Banks tenure at Trinity College on the understanding that he desists teaching the women at Girton. Carolyn has returned from Christmas in Paris and has taught Tess and Celia to can-can. Will Bennett gives Tess the gift of a telescope and admits his love for her. Tess explains that she loves Ralph. Tess sneaks out again to meet Ralph on a hilltop. Whilst out star-gazing they kiss. Carolyn is caught by Mrs Welsh with suffragist literature obtained from Miss Blake. Mrs Welsh issues an ultimatum to Miss Blake. She must give up politics or give up her life at Girton. Celia challenges Tess for putting Ralph above her studies. Tess is insulted and accuses Celia of not understanding love. Carolyn and Tess buy fabric at Mrs Lindley's haberdashery to make banners to promote degrees for women. Lloyd unleashes a tirade against the women, telling them that Britain was built by men, by male leaders and innovators, and that women have no right to go to university. He accuses them of being unnatural women. Mrs Lindley refuses Lloyd's custom but when he points out that his father is the shop landlord she capitulates and sells him a pair of blue stockings. Miss Blake meets with Mr Banks. Miss Blake has left her job and is engaged with gaining support from the suffragist movement on the vote for degrees for women. Mr Banks has also lost his job and now his wife will not look at him. They are accosted by a lady in the café who tell them they should be ashamed to be supporting this cause. Will seeks out Ralph in the junior common room at Trinity. They embroil him in brandy-drinking and card games. He learns that Ralph is to marry – but not to marry Tess. He cannot marry a girl from an institution associated with the radical politics of graduation rights as it would scandalise his family. Will breaks this news to Tess. She is distraught. She confesses to Celia how foolish she has been. She and Celia reconcile. Tess faces her viva examination, but due to spending time with Ralph, she is not as informed as she should be. Carolyn and Celia pass their examinations, but Tess fails. Mrs Welsh allows her to go away for summer and then to return to repeat the year having learned through experience. The day of the vote arrives. An angry mob, perhaps led by Lloyd, has made an effigy of a blue stocking woman and burned it. They smash the windows at Girton. The mob breaks in to the room led by Lloyd. Will stands up for the women. Lloyd punches him out. Mrs Welsh, loses her composure and rushes at Lloyd. He throws her to the ground. Mr Peck arrives with news that the vote went against them. They will not be granted the right to graduate with a degree. Holmes, whilst disagreeing with degrees for women, grants the women a grudging respect. Tess promises to persevere with her education and with the struggle. Tess is leaving on a train for the summer. Will once again tells Tess that he loves her. Tess tells him she cannot love yet, but she may in the future. They agree to meet again in September.  Reception  The play garnered mostly positive reviews. Michael Billington of The Guardian writes, 'the lack of nuance, however, matters less than Swale's ability to capture both the intellectual excitement of being part of a new student generation and the dilemmas it produced.' Charles Spencer of The Telegraph writes, 'Jessica Swale tells the story with both wit and a hint of righteous indignation – and the final reveal of the date when women finally were awarded degrees at Cambridge took me completely by surprise.' Swale earned an Evening Standard Most Promising Playwright nomination in 2013 for her work on the play. In 2015, Blue Stockings entered the GCSE drama syllabus for which Lois Jeary and the playwright produced a students' guide to studying and staging the play.

Nixon, following a degree in American Literature at the University of Essex, also moved to Brighton in the early 90s. It was in Brighton, in 1992, that they founded The Ornate Johnsons, a sketch troupe named after a character they had created in a Damon Runyonesque play set in 1920s USA. Mitchell told Time Out that their aim was 'to bring back energy, drama and extravagant performances to the world of sketch comedy; and to do stuff that wasn’t political or PC. People forget how oppressively right-on everything was around 1989. All the shows have tended to be a collection of loosely linked songs and sketches that make no point beyond raising a laugh.’ The original members of the Ornate Johnsons were Brian Mitchell, David Mounfield and Laurence Relton, and they first performed at the Marlborough Theatre Brighton, in January 1992. They were later joined, at various times, by Glen Richardson, Paul Putner, Louise Law (née Judkins), Beth Fitzgerald, Jo Neary and Clea Smith. Nixon, familiarly known as ‘the unseen Johnson’, does not perform, 'although he makes an occasional Terry Gilliam- like appearance in a show.' For BBC Southern Counties, Matt McGuire reviewed an Ornate Johnsons show at Brighton Festival in 2007: 'The OJs did what they always do: deliver genuinely fantastic, original, playful, surreal and dynamic comedy sketches, including bribery on the Starship Enterprise; football commentators’ on the drama of a man stuffing a pie down his face in seconds; Only Fools And Horses, the opera; and a man who always finishes his girlfriend's sentences.'Matt McGuire, The Ornate Johnsons, BBC Southern Counties website, May 2007 In 2007, BBC4 broadcast the Ornate Johnsons' Edwardian Spectacular, recorded at Wilton's Music Hall. This was followed by a two-week run at the London Arts Theatre, where audiences were 'invited to follow the troupe through the pages of Edwardian history and join The Pankhurst Sisters on Tour, marvel at the devilish magicks of Aleister Crowley and gasp at Charles Rennie Mackintosh – Superhero! This one-hour show brings together the great events and discoveries of the day – from the exploration of the Polar Regions, via Pavlov's dogs, to the sinking of The Titanic. Not even the Great Houdini can escape. And there's a man with a wooden arse.'Chortle page on The Ornate Johnsons' Edwardian Spectacular Three Short Plays about Shops and Love A flyer/programme, designed by Philip Reeve, for Moonlight over India at the Nightingale Theatre, Brighton, 1994 In 1994, Mitchell and Nixon gave up sketch comedy to write a dramatic trilogy: Three Short Plays about Shops and Love. The first was Moonlight over India, a romantic comedy, in the style of Guys and Dolls, set in a 1950s New York drug store. The store is run by Harry, an artist at the soda fountain, whose greatest creation, which he calls 'Moonlight over India' is a 'Triple Chocolate – white, milk AND plain – Double Fudge, Chopped Walnut, Four Scoop Sundae.' The central character, Ed the Bean, is a chocoholic whose girlfriend, Myrtle, thinks it's childish for a man to be interested in candy. Ed is saved from Myrtle by Lara, a tough dame who also loves chocolate. They find love by sharing a 'Moonlight over India'. A flyer/programme, designed by Philip Reeve, for The Bargain at the Nightingale Theatre, Brighton, 1994 The second play was The Bargain, a farce set in the 19th century Russia of Gogol and Chekhov. The central character is the pawnbroker, Riskin, a conceited, indecisive, half-wit who is planning a wedding proposal. Riskin lives with his disapproving mother, and the pair have a comic double act reminiscent of Galton and Simpson. The plot has many comic twists and turns, commented on in soliloquy by Riskin: 'Oh, this is like the plot of some terrible novel! What's going on? Right – I must tackle this logically – I’m good at logic. Was it not I who recognised, in my early twenties, the important link between over-eating and obesity?' The third play Metronome, took its setting, Paris in the 1960s, from Nouvelle Vague cinema. But the style was that of Terence Rattigan, as a sophisticated English couple, in the act of breaking up, visit a music store where the man buys a piano. Much is left unsaid. The woman says, 'If I think about it, my one real regret is that I shall leave here without you and I ever having had what might be termed a 'blazing row'.' The man replies, 'I understand these sort of public histrionics are currently very fashionable, in the theatre, anyway. One only has to walk past the Royal Court to risk being struck on the back of the head by a flat-iron.'Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, Metronome, 1994. The reference to the Royal Court was an acknowledgement of how unusual such plays were in the early 1990s, when British theatre was dominated by experimental companies, like Théâtre de Complicité, and the extreme 'In-yer-face theatre' of the Royal Court. Rattigan was deeply unfashionable in the 1990s. But the Rattigan revival of 2011 suggests that Mitchell and Nixon may have been ahead of their time. The three plays are very different in style, yet they share similar themes. The central male characters are indecisive ineffectual dreamers. Ed the Bean and Riskin are both overgrown children. The women are practical, decisive, and adult, and it is their decisions which shape the course of events. Although conceived as a trilogy, only the first two plays were originally staged together, at the Nightingale Theatre Brighton, transferring to Komedia, Brighton, in 1995. The plays were both directed by Nicholas Quirke, who also played Riskin. Peta Taylor played Riskin's mother. In Moonlight over India Ed and Lara were played by Simon Merrells and Beth Fitzgerald, and Harry, the drug store owner, was played by Ross-Gurney- Randall. The complete trilogy was finally staged in May 2004 at the Sallis Benney Theatre, Brighton. The production, directed by Brian Mitchell, had Ian Shaw as Ed the Bean and Duncan Henderson as Riskin. The man and woman in Metronome were played by Duncan Henderson and Beth Fitzgerald. Moonlight over India was revived again in May 2019, at the Brighton Latest Music Bar, with a cast of Ross Gurney-Randall, Ian Shaw, Joshua Crisp, Amy Sutton, Penny Scott- Andrews and Nick Bartlett. Spy Mitchell and Nixon's next play, Spy, was inspired by 1960s British spy films and TV series, including The Ipcress File, James Bond, The Saint, The Prisoner and The Avengers, with one scene echoing Alain Resnais's Last Year in Marienbad. The central characters are Stroud, another naive male, and Miss Eve, a femme fatale, who breaks into his office one day dressed like Miss Peel from The Avengers. She reveals to him that, for the previous fifteen years, he has been working for ‘the largest intelligence organization in Chingford.’ The play was originally performed at the Nightingale Theatre, Brighton, in 1995, with Mitchell as Stroud and Clea Smith as Miss Eve. Mitchell and Nixon revived and revised it, in 2006, for the East Anglian Pulse Festival, with Duncan Henderson and Beth Fitzgerald in the lead roles. Lynne Mortimer reviewed the production in the East Anglian Times: 'This was a fabulously convoluted story about a Chingford based intelligence organisation and it required any number of paralyzing, knock-out and truth inducing drugs to be administered in the course of the action....Duncan Henderson is magnificent as Stroud, the hapless employee who has spent 15 years trying to avoid being noticed because he doesn't actually do any work. One day, he finds another woman has taken the place of his indisposed secretary – a woman who has a habit of kissing him....Probably no one is who they appear to be and, just when the audience imagines it may have worked out what is going on, it is tossed a googly as one twist in the tale is succeeded by another and then another....There have been many imitators and spoofs of the spy story, but none I think as clever and laughter-provoking as this one'.Lynn Mortimer, Hilarious and Twisted Tale has a Brilliant Debut, East Anglian Times,21 June 2008 Those Magnificent Men In 2010, New Perspectives produced Those Magnificent Men, Mitchell and Nixon's comedy about the first ever non-stop Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown. The play, directed by Daniel Buckroyd, originally had C.P.Hallam as Alcock and Richard Earl as Brown. Philip Reeve reviewed the play: 'Without ever being disrespectful to the real Alcock and Brown, they manage to turn their heroes into a classic British comedy duo in the tradition of Morecambe and Wise, with CP Hallam's Alcock the long-suffering straight man and Richard Earl's Brown the buffoon. And as if history and comedy were not enough, there are points where the characters step out of the action and era of the play to discuss the whole notion of biographical dramas, and shoot down in flames the recent trend for plays and films based on the lives of politicians, comedians and celebrities; works which twist the facts to make the story more interesting....This is a superb piece of theatre, beautifully written and engagingly acted, and it deserves to be widely seen. ' Julie Watterson, in The Stage, wrote, 'The production is full of laughter, pathos and ingenuity, with strong direction from Daniel Buckroyd and creative design by Helen Fownes-Davies, who uses basic trunks for a variety of clever purposes and facilitates the quirky construction of an amusingly credible version of the Vickers-Vimy-Roils aeroplane.'Julie Watterson, Those Magnificent Men, The Stage, 9 February 2010 When the play went to the 2011 Edinburgh Festival, Ian Shaw took over the role of Alcock. In 2015, the play was revived with Mitchell in the role of Alcock and David Mounfield playing Brown. Richard Perry, reviewing a Leicester performance in the Western Park Gazette, said 'If you ever want to see the Charge of the Light Brigade performed in your living room, Brian Mitchell and David Mountfield (sic) could probably do it with sticks, a cushion and a flared nostril apiece....It's a very funny, hands on hips, chin jutting out into the sunset look at old fashioned British heroism and epic boys' own daring do in the face of insurmountable odds and near certain death.' Ross Gurney-Randall and David Mounfield as Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks at the Brighton Media Centre, 2 March 2012 (photograph by Peter Chrisp) Big Daddy Vs Giant Haystacks Mitchell and Nixon's 2011 play, Big Daddy Vs Giant Haystacks, is a comedy about the world of British wrestling, written for the actors Ross Gurney-Randall and David Mounfield. Gurney-Randall played Big Daddy, the 26 stone 9 lb wrestler famous for his feud with the 6 ft 11 inch tall Giant Haystacks, played by Mounfield. The play was a big hit at the 2011 Brighton Festival, where it won a best actor award for Ross-Gurney Randall. At Buxton Festival, it won the Fringe Awards for Best Theatre Production and Best New Writing. In 2013, it went to the Assembly Rooms for the Edinburgh Festival, where Michael Coveney hailed it as 'a sharp and funny sketch show about the heyday (and Haystacks) of television wrestling, with some astute popular cultural referencing and more physical theatre than the entire dance programme at Summerhall (this year's seriously trending, and trendy, venue).'Michael Coveney, WhatsonStage, 6 August 2013 Philip Reeve reviewed the play for The Solitary Bee:'Actors Ross Gurney-Randall and David Mounfield don't just portray Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks, but an immense supporting cast of lesser wrestlers, managers, and TV executives; there are even walk-on parts for Paul McCartney, Frank Sinatra and Princess Margaret....It's all as funny as we've come to expect from Mitchell and Nixon, but it's never just funny: they have a deep sympathy for the people they write about. Ross Gurney Randall's Big Daddy is particularly impressive; reluctant at first, then half believing his own publicity; his unease at having to visit the bedsides of dying children as part of his brother's publicity schemes, and his grief and guilt about the death of an opponent, are exceptionally well-drawn; he's almost a tragic figure (albeit a 26 stone tragic figure in a spangly leotard)'Philip Reeve, Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks, Review, The Solitary Bee, 15 August 2010 Scenes from the play were included in the recent BBC4 documentary ‘When Wrestling Was Golden’. Seven Studies in Salesmanship In 2013, Mitchell and Nixon's Seven Studies in Salesmanship was staged at the Brighton and Buxton Festivals. The piece, featuring David Mounfield, Heather Urquhart, Jenny Rowe and Daniel Beales, was made up of seven short plays linked by the theme of selling. Graham Duff, writer of Ideal and Hebburn, reviewed the Brighton show: 'Matching big laugh-out-loud gags with touching moments of genuine poignancy, Seven Studies in Salesmanship is a beautifully crafted portmanteau production. Much more than just a satire of selling techniques, the show also grapples with narcissism, betrayal and obsession. From urban romantic entanglements to sci-fi vignettes and skewed Roald Dahl- esque morality tales, these stories frequently take unexpected twists and turns.'Producer's feedback, published on the Foundry Group website The Opinion Makers Mitchell and Nixon's The Opinion Makers is a musical comedy about a market research company in Swinging Sixties London. The play, directed by Daniel Buckroyd, opened in October 2013 at the Mercury Theatre, Colchester, with a cast including Mel Giedroyc, David Mounfield and Julie Atherton. The Mercury Theatre website, which describes the play as 'Mad Men meets Carry On', provides this synopsis: 'When the utterly incompetent team at Fernsby Market Research find themselves facing the stiffest challenge of their professional lives – to report what the British Public really think of world famous ‘Doctor Campbell's Lotion’ in readiness for a re-launch – there's only one thing for it; make it all up! After all, that's what market research companies do, isn’t it?'http://www.mercurytheatre.co.uk/event/the-opinion-makers/ The Colchester production received mixed reviews. Revived for the Brighton Festival in May 2014, with Mitchell himself directing, it was more successful, winning an Evening Argus Angel award. Tom Locke, reviewing it in the Argus, wrote, 'Whether there will be a wittier, better crafted or more entertaining show at the Fringe this year remains to be seen, but Brighton boys Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon have set the bar high....This performance was sold out and the reaction at the end was unanimous – a hit!'http://www.theargus.co.uk/leisure/critic/11194216.ARGUS_ANGEL_WINNER__Brighton_Fringe__The_Opinion_Makers__Latest_Music_/ Gilbert (No Sullivan) In 2016, for the 180th anniversary of the birth of W. S. Gilbert, Mitchell and Nixon wrote a stage adaptation of some of the 'Tall Tales and Bonkers Ballads'Description of 'Gilbert (No Sullivan)' on the Foundry Group website he contributed to Punch and Fun magazines. Gilbert (No Sullivan) includes three stories (The Finger of Fate, The Burglar's Story and Foggerty's Fairy) and two Bab Ballads (Annie Protheroe and The Yarn of the Nancy Bell). The show, performed by Mitchell and David Mounfield, toured in Autumn 2016. According to Louise Schweitzer, in the Argus, 'Mounfield and Mitchell romped with minimum props and maximum gusto through Gilbertiana....It was a very clever show from two enormously talented and very funny actors.' Louise Schweitzer, 'Gilbert (No Sullivan)' review, The Argus, 7.11.16 Books and Journalism Mitchell and Nixon are the authors of two books in the Cheeky Guide series: The Cheeky Guide to Student Life and The Cheeky Guide to Love. Both have also contributed to David Bramwell and Tim Bick'sThe Cheeky Guide to Brighton, Nixon writing on 'Vegetarian Brighton' and Mitchell, a self- confessed 'lard lover', a 'Heartfelt Defence of the Greasy Spoon'. The guide to Brighton has gone through five editions, in which Mitchell has gradually documented the loss of the town's old fashioned caffs: 'I have felt like a latter-date Canute, trying to resist the tide of coffee chains, gastro pubs and juice bars.'Brian Mitchell, 'A Heartfelt Defence of the Greasy Spoon', The Cheeky Guide to Brighton, Cheeky Guides Ltd, Fifth Edition, 2006, p121 In a typical review, of the Corner Cafe, Hove, Mitchell writes, 'I particularly recommend the homemade bacon pudding, which once moved my colleague David Mounfield to tears and has certainly brought me close to the condition known as Stendhal syndrome.' Until 2015, Mitchell and Nixon wrote a regular column, Bare Cheek, in Brighton's Latest 7 listings magazine. Regular features include a surreal list of 'Fantabulous Facts About Hove' ('Hove library contains the only known copy of the Necronomicon in existence'; 'Due to some legislative anomaly, all court sessions in Hove are conducted in Jamaican patois'); Etiquette with Hetty Kwet; Edward de Bonehead's Lateral Thinking Puzzles; and 'Ask Uncle Nick', an agony column hosted by local resident, Nick Cave ('Strewth!').

It had its origins in \\"Special Branch\\" a department of the national police that was created in 1952 under the British administration. Among other things it provided intelligence during the Mau Mau uprising . History =19th- century Kenyan intelligence= The Nandi, on hearing of the British, sought to attack them. On the other hand, the Kamba people responded differently to the British as they had traversed the central and coastal areas as long distance traders during which they gathered information for their leaders. British colonists recruited mercenaries as porters and guides. First the mercenaries provided information, but later they served as community chiefs, displacing traditional leaders. This meant that most of those who became chiefs were opportunists. Later the government of the Kenya Protectorate began intelligence gathering which is shown in the timeline below. Timeline/progress *The colonial system did not destroy existing networks, but used them to build a new intelligence system. The colonial government initially gathered information from tourists, missionaries and traders, but after 1895 gathered information at the local level through commissioners and retainers, including from African allies and collaborators. From 1906, intelligence reports were submitted to the Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate. *The British East African Police was established in 1892, and for 18 years gathered intelligence. During World War One, the focus of intelligence gathering changed from African affairs to information on enemy activities in neighbouring countries. African agents were recruited, and tapped telegraphic communications, tracked the enemy, and visited other African workers to gather information. Coastal traders engaged in counter- intelligence. =Special Branch (SB)= *In 1926 a Criminal Investigations Division was created, staffed by colonists, and involving a Special Branch responsible for intelligence. *In the post-World War Two period until 1963, the SB's activities expanded from the collection of intelligence on criminal activities to investigation of citizens agitating for independence and the trade union movement. The SB also expanded to combat the Mau Mau insurgency and was reorganised following intelligence failures. *The post-independence government inherited an intelligence mentality that used force to ensure compliance. After 1965, police and intelligence services became politicised and linked to individuals. By 1982, the police force (including the SB) had become a tool of oppression, systematically abusing the law and disregarding the Constitution. *In 1998, however, the National Security Intelligence Service was created, and over 170 SB officers were purged from the NSIS. In 1999, the NSIS and the police were separated, arrest authority was removed from the NSIS, and a tribunal was established for complaints against the intelligence service. =Kenyan independence/Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI)= In 1963 with independence approaching Special Branch was made independent from the police and in 1969 it was given a new charter. It wasn't until 1986 that it was transformed into the Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI). =National Security Intelligence Service= In 1998, a new act of Parliament in Kenya established the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) to replace the former Directorate of Security Intelligence which at the time was still colloquially known as \\"Special Branch\\". The first director general (DG) of the new service was retired Brigadier Wilson A.C. Boinett who served until 2006, when he was replaced with Major-General Michael Gichangi. In January 2011 Gichangi was appointed to a second five-year term. However, Gichangi did not complete his term and resigned his position in August 2014 citing personal reasons. His replacement, Major-General Philip Kameru then serving as the head of military intelligence, was appointed in September after vetting by the National Assembly.http://ustawi.info.ke/index.php/government/government-under-the-new- constitution/national-intelligence-service NSIS's intelligence gathering work includes: internal, external and strategic intelligence. The NSIS is charged with identifying conditions that threaten Kenya's political, economic and social stability. It develops techniques and strategies to neutralise such threats. The NSIS director is the national security advisor to the president of Kenya. The NSIS was relocated from the notorious offices of Special Branch at Nyati House to new headquarters on the outskirts of the city, near the Windsor Golf and Country Hotel. In April 1999, the Moi government appointed Mrs Pamela Mboya, the former Permanent representative to the Habitat, to head a Committee that was charged with formulating a scheme of service for NSIS officers.https://fas.org/irp/world/kenya/ Security of tenure given the Director General of NSIS is designed to protect him from such abuse by members of the governing elite.

Biography =Early life= Gooch was born on 3 April 1770 to William and Sarah Gooch and baptised on 8 May 1770 at the church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Brockdish near Diss in Norfolk. William was schooled in nearby Harleston, Norfolk and later Stradbroke School in Suffolk. His sister, Sarah, succumbed to smallpox at the age of 10 in 1777 and so, in \\"tender solicitude\\", his parents were protective over their son and would not let him \\"mix with other children, except in their presence\\". Gooch's father was barber and peruke maker to the gentry of Brockdish, church warden and also fulfilled the role of village constable for a short time. It was due to his father's services that the young William came to the attention of the owner of the village hall, Thomas Maynard (later Sir Thomas Maynard Hesilrige, 10th Baronet of Noseley Hall), who proved key in providing Gooch with the opportunity to go to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. =Cambridge education= William Gooch was admitted as a sizar to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge at the age of 16 on 30 May 1786, matriculated in the Michaelmas term of 1787, achieved his B.A. (Second Wrangler) in 1791 being awarded with the Smith's Prize and the Schuldham college prize and became a junior Fellow until his death in 1792. At Cambridge, Gooch formed a friendship with a Miss Sally Smithson, the daughter of a cook at St John's College, Cambridge, with whom he continued to correspond after setting sail to join the Vancouver Expedition. He affectionately referred to her as \\"little goody two-shoes\\". =From student to astronomer= It had been presumed that Gooch would follow his academic career into the priesthood, but perhaps being aware of the need for an astronomer to join the Vancouver Expedition, before he had sat his final exams, his Cambridge associates Samuel Vince and John Brinkley, who had both attended the same school as Gooch at Harleston, suggested him to Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, who sat on the Board of Longitude. After some lobbying from his Cambridge supporters and friends, Gooch travelled to London in April 1791, and Maskelyne began preparing him for the expedition. He also received advice on his forthcoming adventure from William Wales, who had served as astronomer to Cook. In July 1791, Gooch was making his final preparations and boarding the Daedalus at Deptford. Gooch was appointed at a salary of £400 a year and issued with a suit of navigational and astronomical instruments. He sailed on the storeship Daedelus in August 1791, aiming to meet George Vancouver at Nootka Sound. =Death and legacy= In Gooch's final letter to his parents, written on 2 May 1792, he speaks of his concerns over having used a false meridian and his hopes of being re-united with them in the autumn of 1794. On 11 May 1792, Lieutenant Richard Hergest, commander of the Daedalus, embarked on the ship's cutter along with Gooch and a small crew to trade with the locals and re-supply with fresh water at Waimea on Oahu, in the Hawaiian islands. The party was attacked by Pahupu (Hawaiian warriors) on 12 May. Hergest, Gooch and a sailor were cut off from the rest of the group and killed. Gooch's story is recorded in his letters, many of which were to his parents, and journal which are housed as part of the Board of Longitude archive at Cambridge University Library. His biography, The Death of William Gooch: A History's Anthropology, was written in 1995 by Greg Dening and illustrates the dangers of cross-cultural encounters in the exploration era.

In 2004, Holcomb was selected for the prestigious Marshall Memorial Fellowship from the German Marshall Fund of the United States. As an American Marshall Memorial Fellow, he traveled throughout the European Union meeting with Members of the European Parliament, Ambassadors from throughout Europe and Member State National Leaders, forming a broader perspective on foreign policy and bilateral relations between United States and the EU. =Military service= Holcomb served in the Army JAG Corps, serving as a labor counselor, military prosecutor, and international law attorney. He deployed overseas for Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. He wrote about his experiences in an article that was published by the Chicago Journal of International Law. He also co-authored an article about the need to update the laws of war in the Christian Science Monitor. =Law career= Holcomb previously worked at Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP, and is now at Holcomb + Ward, LLP, with a practice that includes securities litigation and enforcement. He also represents veterans and their family members on a pro bono basis. Political career =Run for state-wide office= In 2006 Holcomb unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primary election, where he sought his party's nomination for Georgia Secretary of State. =Georgia House of Representatives, 2011–present= In 2010, Holcomb ran unopposed as a Democrat for a Georgia House of Representatives seat that was unexpectedly vacated by the incumbent who announced his retirement a few days after qualifying to run for reelection. Holcomb was reelected in 2012 following a redistricting that combined his district with that of another Democrat (Elena Parent) and that made the district--Georgia House District 81--a majority Republican district. He has since retained the seat for 3 terms, and is currently serving a 4th term after winning the 2016 election. Holcomb served as Chief Deputy Whip of the House Democratic Caucus. He serves as a member on the Judiciary, Defense & Veterans Affairs, Higher Education, Juvenile Justice, and Public Safety and Homeland Security committees. Legislation In 2016, Holcomb sponsored a bipartisan bill to enforce the collection, testing and reporting of medical kits for victims of sexual assault, in spite of strong opposition by Georgia State Senator Renee Unterman, (who eventually voted for the bill). His bipartisan efforts, which included collaborating with Republican Speaker David Ralston and Democratic Senator Elena Parent, were featured on the news satire television program Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. Holcomb supports juvenile justice reform, deepening the Port of Savannah, and encouraging more students to graduate from high school and college. He was the driving force behind legislation in 2018 that helped victims of domestic violence break their leases without an early termination penalty. In 2019, he passed legislation to extend the length of time that Georgia would preserve evidence in cases involving sexual assault. He has played a role in the national response to addressing the backlog of untested sexual assault kits. Holcomb is considered a rising star in the Georgia Democratic Party and is often mentioned as a possible candidate for statewide or federal office in the not too distant future.

These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve's fibers and temporary (a few months, usually) interference with the transmission of nerve signals. In these procedures, the thin protective layer around the nerve fiber, the basal lamina, is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber regrows, it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgical cutting of a nerve (neurectomy), severs these basal lamina tubes, and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, over time a painful neuroma or deafferentation pain may develop. This is why the neurolytic is usually preferred over the surgical block. The neurolytic block is sometimes used to temporarily reduce or eliminate pain in part of the body.

The operation included mining coal and iron ore, smelting, refining, casting and forging to create finished products. Mineral deposits Iron is said to have been worked in the vicinity of Bradford in Roman times. The monks of Rievaulx Abbey to the east were working iron on land owned by their monastery in 1150, and forgemen are mentioned in 1358. Surface coal was being extracted from outcrops and shallow pits by 1360, and coal mines were worked by 1502. The Bowling Ironworks were established in the 1780s to smelt and forge iron from the Black Bed ironstone deposits using coal from the Better Bed seam, both of which lay under the site. The ironstone yields about 32% iron. The Better Bed coal is free of sulfur, making it ideal for furnaces used in smelting, puddling and forging. The Black Bed coal, nearer to the surface, could be sold or used for firing boilers and other purposes. Mining began in Jeremiah Rawson's estate, then extended into nearby estates as the deposits became exhausted, always mining the same beds of minerals. In 1794 the company purchased from Francis Lindley Wood (owner of Bolling Hall and Lord of the Manor) the rights to 90 acres of coal and iron stone in Hall Lane, Broomfields. In 1806 the company purchased additional mineral rights to parts of Sir Francis Lindley Wood's Bowling Hall Estate . The rights to other land was purchased in later years, often after extensive negotiation. In 1816 the company purchased from Sir Francis all his remaining lands and mineral rights in Bowling and in 1821 purchased from him the Lordship of the Manor. The same seams of ironstone and coal were exploited by the Low Moor Iron Company, founded in 1788, and then by the Bierley Iron Company from around 1810. Foundation The first foundry was established at Bowling around 1784 by a group of businessmen including John Sturges, an ironmaster with works at Wakefield, and Richard Paley (1746-1808), an iron merchant of Leeds. The other partners were John Sturges junior, William Sturges and John Ewell. Ewell left the partnership in 1792. The company took the name of John Sturges & Company. Iron was brought to the foundry from Wakefield in the early years. The first products were items for domestic use such as laundry irons, ovens, boilers, window sash weights and clock weights. The smelting plant was established in 1788, producing pig iron that was used in the boiler plates for the first steam engine at the Low Moor works. As late as 1792 pig iron was delivered to Wakefield and wrought iron received in exchange. In 1804 the partnership was extended, bringing in George Paley (1779-1865) and John Green Paley (1774-1860) - respectively the son and nephew of Richard Paley - plus Thomas Mason and the Reverend John Simons. History A part of the ironworks in 1861 The Bowling works were selling large quantities of guns, shot and shells to the British government before 1790. Cast iron was used for guns before the invention of wrought iron, and the cast iron guns were subject to rigorous production controls and quality tests. On 27 July 1796 the partners signed an agreement with Matthew Boulton and James Watt to pay royalties on the two steam engines in use at the works, and to be allowed to make additional steam engines at the works, paying royalties. When Sir William Armstrong invented wrought-iron guns, some of the first coils he used were Bowling iron. Bowling iron, or Best Yorkshire, became well known around the world. Steam hammers were installed at the Bowling Ironworks where the steam cylinder was bolted to the back of the hammer, thus reducing the height of the machine. These were designed by John Charles Pearce, who took out a patent for his steam hammer design several years before James Nasmyth's patent expired. On 14 November 1848 a new partnership was created with the name of Bowling Iron Co., confirmed by act of parliament in August 1849. The company was incorporated and registered in 1870. A female worker demonstrates an elevating device for barrels at the Bowling Iron Works, Bradford, in November 1918. An 1891 description said the ironworks lay in, The plant at that time included blast furnaces and refineries used in the first stages of iron manufacture, puddling and ball furnaces with high brick or iron chimneys, a shed housing the steam hammers, steelworks, a large machine shop, boiler works, a large foundry and other workshops and buildings. A narrow gauge railway was used to move material within the works, and a line to the Great Northern Railway was used to ship the products. A network of tramways brought minerals from the pits to the works, with wagons pulled by wire ropes powered by stationary engines. Four large pumps were being used to keep the mines dry, with some of the water used in the ironworks. The Bowling Iron Company went into liquidation in 1898. In 1903 the company was reorganized as The Bowling Iron Company. It was liquidated in 1921. Conditions By 1840 Bradford was known for having some of the most smoke-filled air in Britain. As early as 1803 an act had stated that, \\"Engine chimneys are to be erected of sufficient height as not to create a nuisance by the emission of smoke. All owners of engines etc. are to construct fireplaces thereof in such a manner as most effectually to destroy and consume the smoke arising therefrom.\\" However, little was done to enforce the laws. There was a general feeling that the factories provided work, so should not be pushed too hard to reduce pollution. An 1841 account said, \\"The condition of Bradford is dreadful. Lowmoor iron- forges most extensively spread their suffocating exhalations on the one side ... On the other side, Bowling Iron Hell (for it is one truly) casts a still denser atmosphere and sulphurous stench...\\" The Bowling Iron Company was fined on 12 December 1874, but only for £5 with £9. 10s. costs for ten offences. The population suffered high levels of respiratory diseases, peaking in 1890 during an influenza epidemic. The method of paying the men led them into temptation of intemperance and extravagance: According to H. Hartopp, manager of the Bowling Works, St John's Church, Wakefield Road, Bowling, Bradford, built in 1842 at the expense of the Bowling Iron Company The company built St. John's Church, Bowling, at its own expense of ₤5,000. The church was consecrated on 8 February 1842. It is built in the Lancet-Gothic style and is in size, with a spire. The church was the first to be built in England of iron and stone, with only the rafters made of wood. In April 1847 St. John's school in Bowling was visited. The Bowling Iron company had erected the building, but did not contribute much to its expenses. There were on average 150 children at the school, of whom 12 were factory workers. Only seven children had reached aged 13. The schoolroom had poor lighting and ventilation, and there was no mistress to instruct the older children. In the mines, hurrier-boys would drag carriages along tracks to the miners, then drag the filled carriages back to the pit shaft and hook them to a chain so they could be pulled up. An 1843 inquiry into child labor said of Jabez Scott, aged fifteen, a worker at the Bowling Iron Works: \\"Work is very hard; sleeps well sometimes, sometimes is very ill tired and cannot sleep so weel [sic].\\" An 1847 report noted that there was considerable temptation to employ boys in the mines when they were below the legal age, then ten years of age. \\"Managers, &c.;, of mines, complain that the work required of boys in seams of coal not more than 18 inches to two feet thick, is done at a disadvantage, unless they are brought to it from their earliest years.\\" In 1875 there was an explosion in the Bowling Iron Company's Crosses Pit mine, where 40 men and boys were working. Four ironstone getters and hurriers were killed, and others injured. The cause seems to have been accidental ignition of gunpowder being used to break up large pieces of scale that contained the ironstone. A select committee of the House of Commons in 1877 heard that in West Yorkshire, including the Bowling Iron Works, the colliers employed boys as assistants, rather the boys being employed by the company, although the boys had their names entered and were subject to the colliery rules. At that time Bowling employed about 2,000 workmen in the collieries, and it was estimated that about two men died each year. Accident rates were higher in the iron works, despite employment being lower. Boys were employed in various capacities in the ironworks, such as wheeling hot lumps of puddled iron to the hammers.

The species was described as new in 2013. The specific name neblina is Spanish for fog or mist, referring to the cloud forest habitat of the olinguito. On 22 May 2014, the International Institute for Species Exploration declared the olinguito as one of the \\"Top 10 New Species of 2014\\" among species discovered in 2013. It is the first new carnivoran mammal described in the Western Hemisphere in 35 years. Description The olinguito is distinct from the other species within the genus, popularly known as \\"olingos\\", and also from the kinkajou (kinkajous resemble olingos, but are not closely related). Its average weight is , making it the smallest procyonid. The animal is an omnivorous frugivore that eats mainly fruits (such as figs), but also insects and nectar; this diet results in feces the size of small blueberries. The olinguito is thought to be solitary, nocturnal and moderately reclusive. Olinguitos appear to be strictly arboreal. They have a single pair of mammae, and probably produce a single offspring at a time. Distribution and habitat Specimens of the species have been identified from the Andean cloud forest stretching from western Colombia to Ecuador, at elevations of 5,000 to 9,000 feet, which is the highest known range of any member of the genus Bassaricyon. Its discovery was confirmed in the wild and announced on 15 August 2013. The species is not considered to be immediately at risk, but it is estimated that over 40 percent of the animal's potential range has been deforested. Discovery Bassaricyon neblina, illustrated by Nancy Halliday, 2013 Its discovery was announced on 15 August 2013 by Kristofer Helgen, the curator of mammals at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, olingo expert Roland Kays of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and collaborators. Helgen discovered specimens of the species in storage at The Field Museum in Chicago and used DNA testing to confirm a new species. The researchers who identified the species were unable to discover any local names specific to it. The discovery was the first identification of a new mammal species of the order CarnivoraThe olinguito is omnivorous: not all carnivoran species are carnivores. (Further explanation may be found in the linked articles, including carnivoran diet specializations.) in the Americas in 35 years. Olinguitos were regularly seen and even publicly exhibited decades before they were recognized as members of a new species. The animal had previously been confused with its taxonomic cousins, the olingos. One such example was Ringerl, an olinguito who lived in the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., for a year and also toured many other zoos. Researchers unsuccessfully tried to breed her with olingos, not realizing she was a different species. Ringerl died in 1976. Taxonomic evaluation The olinguito is smaller than the other species in the genus Bassaricyon. Its body (head to rump) is approximately long, and its tail long. It is also much furrier and has a shorter tail and smaller ears than others that share its genus. The olinguito is found in the northern Andes at altitudes between above sea level, which is much higher than the habitats for other olingos. Based on morphological distinctions, four olinguito subspecies have been described: the nominate Bassaricyon neblina neblina, and B. n. osborni, B. n. hershkovitzi, and B. n. ruber. Each of these subspecies, though, were found to have a dental formula characteristic of other members of the family Procyonidae. Comparison of DNA from two olinguito subspecies to other olingo and related species was carried out on the basis of genetic dissimilarity derived from Kimura modeling of differences in base-pair composition of mitochondrial cytochrome b. The genetic divergence between olinguitos and other olingos makes olinguitos a basal sister lineage to the rest of the genus, and is equivalent to differences between species which have been assigned to separate subgenera or genera. This split apparently occurred about 3.5 million years ago, suggesting that the earliest diversification of the genus took place in northwestern South America shortly after the ancestors of olingos first invaded the continent from Central America as part of the Great American Interchange. Conservation The olinguito may be at risk in the future due to deforestation and urbanization (“The researchers reporting its discovery estimated that 42% of suitable historic olinguito habitat had already been converted to agriculture or urban areas and an additional 21% remained in natural but largely unforested conditions…”). Since the natural habitat of the olinguito is at higher elevations, this means that its \\"cloud forest habitat\\" definitely needs to be protected in order to optimize this species' probability of survival. As of now, no strict efforts are known to be in place in order to reduce habitat destruction.

Although the current church dates from the 13th century, it was probably preceded by one of the earliest churches on Gotland at this site. Stenkyrka Church is dominated by its large tower and its interior is decorated with medieval murals. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby. History According to the Gutasaga, a man called Lickajr the Wise built one of the first churches on Gotland in Stenkyrka. If true, this first church was almost certainly wooden. The name Stenkyrka (literally in Swedish: stone church) implies that also the stone church is very early, from a time when buildings made of stone (rather than wood) was still a phenomenon unusual enough to give name to a place. This first, Romanesque church is also gone, but traces have been found and archaeologists have been able to determine that it was a small church with tower, nave and choir. The Romanesque church was successively replaced by the presently visible church starting in the mid-13th century. The choir was rebuilt first, followed by the nave, which was inaugurated by the bishop of Linköping in 1255. The tower was added during the 14th century, and modelled after three similar city churches (since destroyed) in Visby. The church underwent a restoration in 1954-55. Architecture The church is dominated by the large tower, described as one of the finest church towers on Gotland. The church has two simple Romanesque portals and a Gothic tower portal. Inside, the church is richly decorated with murals, dating from three different periods. The oldest ones are from the middle of the 13th century and mainly ornamental. Later but from the same century are a number of paintings depicting imaginary animals, drapery and marble imitation. The most recent murals, from the end of the 14th century, depict figures and scenes from the bible. The furnishings are mostly from after the reformation. A finely carved crucifix dates from the late 14th century, and the baptismal font is from the 12th century. The church is also the location of the oldest dated gravestone on Gotland, from the year 1200.

History The park was initially constructed in 1937 as a tobacco factory under the name under the Japanese government. After Japan ceded Taiwan in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it as the Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. In 1947, the plant was renamed again as Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Bureau. The factory ceased to produce cigarettes in 1998 for concern over urban planning, tobacco and liquor marketing regulatory changes and the decline in tobacco demand. In 2001, the Taipei City Government designed the defunct tobacco factory as Taipei's 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites, historical structures and architectural highlights. Together with Taipei Dome, the site is known as Taipei Cultural and Sporting Complex. For more efficient reuse of space, in 2011 the former factory was turned into a creative park by its current name to provide venues for diverse cultural and creative exhibitions and performances. Purposes The park has the following aims: * Establish public platform and develop the cultural and creative industry; * Cultivate culture and creativity and cross industry exchanges; * Develop innovative experiments and set trends; * Provide cultural and arts education and encourage public involvement; * Spotlight the cultural and creative industry and put Taiwan on the map.

The workers manufactured cigarettes on the second floor of the plant. After packaging the rolled cigarettes, the boxes were sent directly to warehouse no. 2 using conveyor channel, through the turntable, directed to the platforms for delivery, hence reducing manual labor. =Inspection Room= The inspection room served as the place for employees and officers had to pass through when reporting for or getting off work. It had stationed guards on duty. =Office Building= =Taiwan Design= =Taiwan Design Museum= The Taiwan Design Museum building used to house the office for supervisors and officers of the tobacco plant. The office had also conference rooms and rest areas for guests. Ordinary plant employees were not allowed to access the building. =Innovative Design Lab= =Tobacco Factory= The tobacco factory consists of three segments, which are North, South and East. The building has characteristics of long open hallways with no dividing walls. The first floor mainly comprises columns to support the weight of the machines on the second floor. =Baroque Garden= Enclosed by the tobacco factory three sections, the garden has a fountain that is surrounded by sculptures of naked women emerging from their baths. =TMSK Restaurant= The building which now houses the TMSK restaurant used to be the machine repair plant building. The machine repair plant was exclusively responsible for the reparation and maintenance of the tobacco producing machines. =Boiler Room= The boiler room acted as the power source for the tobacco plant. Coal was burnt here to provide power for the plant. The chimneys were used to expel the smoke generated. =Nursery Room= There used to be 1,200 employees working at the plant at the same time. The tobacco plant had an industrial village concept, in which it included facilities such as cafeterias, shower facilities, dormitories, hospital, food mall, dining rooms, entertainment rooms and nursery. The nursery room served as a place for the infants of the employees to rest and play. =Ecology Pond= For fire extinguishing, ventilation and hydrosphere purposes, a large lotus pond was installed.

Career  Katherine Warington's father had worked at Rothamsted Experimental Station. Here she began as a voluntary worker, much like visiting scientists today.(1987) 'Happy Birthday Katherine Warington'. Micronutrient News 8(1) p. 3 She was then appointed to the Botany Department in 1921, working with Dr. Winifred Brenchley. Warington's work with boron came about because an entomologist wanted to find a way of making bean plants distasteful to black fly (Aphis). The botanists were responsible for supplying solutions with a range of concentrations of various elements for water culture solutions. These included several elements, of which boron was one, not previously recognized as plant nutrients. Using the solutions he found that all his plants died except those given boron.Nicol, H. (1942) 'What the plant does with its materials'. Nature 3792 p.13 Warington's work required meticulous care as she had to maintain a boron free solution as her control throughout the life of the beans. Her test solution concentrations were as low as 5 ppm (parts per million). Everyone coming into the glasshouse had first to wash their hands even if they weren't going to handle the plants. By 1923 she had published the proof that boron was essential to the healthy growth of broad beans. Dr Hugh Nicol commented \\"It is not given to everyone to found a minor industry with her first piece of research, yet this, in effect, happened in her case...the agricultural consumption of boron compounds attained considerable dimension\\". Warington went on to produce papers on other micronutrients including molybdenum and manganese. St Nicholas church in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Warington also worked with Brenchley on the Rothamsted Classical Experiments: Broadbalk (winter wheat study started 1843) and Park Grass (started 1856), where from 1921 they carried out field surveys of weeds. Warington tested the germination of weed seeds, demonstrating that most species had an optimal germination period during the year.  Later life  Katherine Warington retired in 1957. She had an active retirement including voluntary clerical work at the St Nicholas' parish office. During her last few years she lived in a residential home in St Albans where she died on 3 July 1993 following a stroke at the age of 95. She is buried in the family plot in St Nicholas Churchyard.

Life Born on 24 October 1756, he was the son of Simon Newport, a banker at Waterford, by his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Riall of Clonmel. After receiving his education at Eton College and Trinity College, Dublin, he became a partner in his father's bank. He took part in the convention of volunteer delegates which met in Dublin under the presidency of James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont in November 1783, and was appointed a member of the committee of inquiry into the state of the borough representation in Ireland. Newport was created a baronet on 25 August 1789, with remainder to his brother, William Newport. At the general election, in July 1802, he unsuccessfully contested the city of Waterford in the Whig interest against William Congreve Alcock. Newport, however, obtained the seat on petition in December 1803, and continued to represent Waterford until his retirement from parliamentary life at the dissolution in December 1832. On the formation of the Ministry of All the Talents, Newport was appointed Chancellor of the Irish exchequer (25 February 1806), and was sworn a member of the English privy council on 12 March 1806. He brought in his first Irish budget on 7 May 1806. In November of this year he was returned for St Mawes, as well as for the city of Waterford, but chose to sit for Waterford. He brought in his second budget on 25 March 1807, and shortly afterwards resigned office with the rest of his colleagues. Newport was created a D.C.L. of the University of Oxford on 3 July 1810. Newport did not accept office in Lord Liverpool's administration, because the government was averse to measures of Catholic emancipation. He was a leading critic of the Earl of Elgin's removal of the Elgin Marbles from Athens, commenting that \\"The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loots those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred\\". He spoke for the last time in the House of Commons on 25 June 1832, during the debate in committee on the Parliamentary Reform Bill for Ireland. On 11 October 1834 he was appointed Comptroller General of the Exchequer, a new office. He retired in 1839, with a pension, and died at Newpark, near Waterford, on 9 Feb. 1843. He was buried in Waterford Cathedral on 15 February following. His tenacity with inquiries in the House of Commons earned him the nickname of the \\"Political Ferret\\". Works Newport was the author of The State of the Borough Representation of Ireland in 1783 and 1800, London, 1832. Family Newport married Ellen, third daughter of Shapland Carew of Castle Boro, M.P. for Waterford city, by whom he had no issue. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew, the Rev. John Newport, on whose death, on 15 February 1859, the baronetcy became extinct.

Some of the original interior details remain; there is a visible line running east to west down the center of the northeast parlor floor indicating that an addition was made at some time. The first owner of the house was Colonel Middleton Stuart and his wife, Emma Barnwell Stoney.

The focus on the game is construction of gunfighters and team-based gameplay. Gameplay The gameplay of GAR is divided between two main activities – robot construction and arena combat. =Robot Construction= Screenshot from the GAR garage The player starts in the Garage where he/she can assemble a robot from stand-alone parts and composite modules. Several parts are readily available while more powerful components must be unlocked by paying Credits – an in-game currency, earned by destroying opponents and completing objectives in combat. Players can also purchase Credits, but all of the parts can be obtained through regular gameplay. Each robot is composed of several main modules – Chassis, Body, Weapons, and Head, each with their specific function and stats. Only the Body’s destruction eliminates the player completely from the game, while the other modules can be destroyed and still allow the player to continue fighting, albeit at a disadvantage. A destroyed Chassis will immobilize the player, and a destroyed Head will reverse his directional input. During the Open Beta, a fifth module type was added – Devices. These range from mines, to shield walls, to turrets, and add a deeper strategic edge to the gameplay. =Arenas= A screenshot from the map \\"Abordage\\" A screenshot from the map \\"Suburbia\\" When a player is satisfied with the assembled robot, he can start battle. The arena and the members of each team are randomly selected. As of August 2013, three arenas are available – \\"High Noon\\" (inspired by Wild West frontier towns), \\"Suburbia\\" and \\"Abordage\\", featuring a pirates' theme. =Modes= Combat occurs in a classical third-person shooter fashion (although players can also zoom into first-person view), playable in timed 5-minute rounds, without respawn. GAR features three game modes, playable on each map and randomly assigned when a game round begins. In addition to the standard Team Deathmatch, Capture the Batteries offers a similar experience to the classic \\"capture the flag\\" modes, but the player has to obtain two of the opposing team’s batteries; the second enemy battery only spawns when the first one is delivered to the stealing player’s home base. Bomb Squad features a bomb that must be planted at the enemy base, and then protected until it detonates. Both \\"Capture the Batteries\\" and \\"Bomb Squad\\" award bonus XP and Credits if the round is won by completing its objective (as opposed to destroying the enemy team), which encourages team coordination and a more tactical approach, rather than a head-on assault. Development history According to the developers' interview, the concept of the game came into their minds after an internal contest by the end of 2011. The game was officially announced on 17 July 2012 initially with one map, \\"High Noon\\": a western-themed arena. Masthead Studios utilizes the Unity game engine to craft the graphics and atmosphere in the game. The game is offered in a free to play format. On 16 October 2012 the first phase of the game release was an invitation-only closed beta and the invitations were sent to selected players who registered earlier for the closed beta test. At the beginning the matches within Guns and Robots follow a last man standing style of gameplay or \\"team deathmatch\\" mode where teams of 5 must destroy each other until no robot remains. Each robot’s components can be individually damaged and destroyed, meaning robots can be crippled and unable to move or shoot before being destroyed. The open beta of the game was released on January 2013. On 8 July 2013, the development team behind Guns and Robots unveiled a detailed roadmap for the then-upcoming major updates in matchmaking and global rebalance. Along with the major updates there were new modes released – \\"Capture the Batteries\\" and \\"Bomb Squad\\".

He did his primary education in his native village, in a madrassas directed by his father, Muhametzakir, with an Orenburg governor appointed Mullah from the Asyan mahalallah. In 1910, he traveled the Kazakh steppes and taught Kazakh children. Between the years 1911 and 1916, Babich studied in the madrassas Galia in Ufa, a time during which he became deeply interested in literature. He participated in literary and musical circles, and published manuscripts in the madrassas publication Parlak. After graduation, he went to the Troitsk to work as a teacher, a period during which he also worked for the magazine Akmulla. Most of Babich's literary work was created in the Tatar language, he was published in Tatar magazines and newspapers. Babich began to write poetry in the Bashkir language since 1917. He lived in Ufa for a short time during the summer of 1917, and then moved to Orenburg, where he worked for the satirical magazine Carmack (meaning \\"Rod\\"). Babich became more invested in the Bashkir liberation movement in the autumn of 1917, when he became member of a party for the Bashkir movement and worked as the Secretary of the Bashkir regional (central) shuro (Council) of the Autonomous Bashkurdistana, as well as working as the editor of the newspaper Bashkort, and head of the youth organization of the Bashkirs, Тулҡын (meaning \\"Wave\\").

A recreation of a 17th-century Swedish farmstead, it was located in City Park, and served as a historical remembrance of the history of the Swedish and Finnish people who arrived as part of the colony of New Sweden in early America. Originally opened in 1988, it operated as a living museum for many years. As funding and attendance declined, the log buildings at the complex fell into disrepair, requiring it to close. Beginning in 2011, fundraising and restoration efforts allowed a partial re-open. Later, a decision was made to move the museum's buildings to Governor Printz Park in the community of Essington, Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania. On June 1, 2019, the newly restored residence building was dedicated in the park, and the remaining six building will be reconstructed when funds are available. New Sweden  Although not part of the New Sweden Farmstead Museum, the Mortonson- Van Leer Log Cabin in Swedesboro is a log building typical of New Sweden In 1638, Swedes and Finns arrived in the Delaware Valley on the ships the Kalmar Nyckel and Fogel Grip to found the colony of New Sweden. Tradition holds that a settlement was first planted by a group of Finns in and around Finns Point almost immediately. among them, the family of Anders Sinicka, whose surname has many variations. http://nc-chap.org/cranehook/pdfs/cranehook1693c.pdf In 1643 they built Fort Nya Elfsborg near Salem. Spreading across South Jersey into what is now Salem, Cumberland, and Gloucetser they built farming communities along its rivers and streams. Eric Pålsson Mullica was an early settler remembered in many regional placenames. By 1649 villages at Sveaborg, now Swedesboro, New Jersey, and Nya Stockholm, today's Bridgeport, where established. It has been suggested that the presence of Forest Finns was influential in the development of log building in the USA. There are several original structures in the region from the era which are among some of the oldest buildings in New Jersey and some of the oldest non-Spanish built in the United States. Among them are the Caesar Hoskins Log Cabin, the C. A. Nothnagle Log House, the Mortonson-Van Leer Log Cabin (originally located on Raccoon Creek and moved to Old Swedes Church in Swedesboro), the Swedish Granary and the Swedish Cabin at Hancock House. Construction and opening The New Sweden Company, Incorporated was established in 1983 with the mission recreate a village to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the arrival of the European colonists. The project was originally intended to be built in Salem but after some controversy it was decided the locate it in Bridgeton. The museum was built in 1987. A team of experts associated with the Riksförbundet för Hembygdvärd (National Association for Homestead Care) from Sweden supervised the on-site construction of the log structures using traditional materials and methods to replicate a 17th-century farmstead, or gård. It comprised a farmhouse/residence, a blacksmith shop, a storehouse, a Granary (threshing barn), a stable, a barn with outhouse, a sauna and a Smokehouse. Furnaces, chimneys, and fireplaces were also authentically constructed. The collection included furnishings, farm equipment, and other artifacts genuinely of Swedish-Finnish origin which by 2011 had been inventoried and moved from temporary to climate controlled storage. The museum was formally opened on April 14, 1988 by Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden accompanied by Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean and his wife Deborah. The royal family donated candleholders to the museum. Fundraising and subsequent closure The farmstead remained a popular attraction in the area for about 10 years, but following a downturn in the local economy, funding and attendance declined and the attraction was closed. By 2011, the New Sweden Colonial Homestead Foundation was fundraising to restore and re-open the museum. The elements had taken their toll on the buildings; at the time, it was estimated that $10,000 per structure was needed for roof repairs. In September 2011, a fundraising reception was attended by the Swedish Ambassador to the United States, Jonas Hafström to draw attention to the foundation's efforts. Various fundraising activities at the farmstead were done in collaboration with summer youth programs. The homestead received grants from Cumberland County and Swedish Council of America, among others. In 2012 the foundation received $10,000 donation from owners of Bridgeton-based Whibco. The Swedish Colonial Society was also enlisted to help with restoration efforts. Eventually plans were made to permanently close and move the museum. In 2015, a move to Wilmington, Delaware (site of New Sweden's Fort Christina) was considered. Later, a decision was made to move the buildings to Governor Printz Park in the community of Essington, Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania, the site of New Sweden's The Printzhof. On June 1, 2019, the newly reconstructed residence building was dedicated in the park and, as of 2020, the stable and forge are being reconstructed, with the remaining four buildings in storage.

It was during the period of the Japanese occupation of Malaya when Phooi Chen had borne him two sons namely Paul Heah Hock Teik (born 1943) and Jeffrey Heah Hock Hai (born 1944).Pamela Ong, \\"Fortitude: The life and times of Heah Joo Seang\\" 2014 Page 114-115 About a thousand people gathered at the Penang Bayan Lepas airport to receive his body which was flown back from London.The Straits Times, 20 May 1962, Page 17 His family had decided to follow the old custom concerning death that happens outside of a person's home – when a person dies outside of his home, he cannot be brought back into the house. Accordingly, when he was welcomed at the airport, they did so as if he were still alive. There was no weeping and no black clothes or other signs of mourning until his body was back at his mansion, \\"Goodwood,\\" in Macalister Road, and his death then announced by a representative of the family. His body was borne in a coffin draped in red and was accompanied by a motorcade nearly five (5) miles long.The Straits Times, 19 May 1962, Page 9 The announcement of his death was made by Rev.

Michael said the Christian Brothers had reason to grieve over the loss of a \\"great old boy and a very generous benefactor.\\" He said that Joo Seang was unsparing in his attachment to his old school and worked towards its progress and improvement with genuine affection and loyalty. In referring to two new schools completed at Jalan Brother James and Kampong Bharu, he said, \\"These schools will stand as monuments to a public-spirited citizen whose departure leaves a gap which it will be very difficult to fill.\\"The Straits Times, 16 May 1962, Page 6 Reporting on his funeral, the Straits Times noted, \\"Crowds swelling to well over 50,000 lined an eight-mile route today for the funeral of the late Mr. Heah Joo Seang, millionaire rubber magnate and Penang MCA President, whose body was flown home last week from London where he died on May 14.

Three Cabinet Ministers together with the Governor of Penang, Raja Tun Uda Al-Haj, and the Chief Minister, Inche Aziz Ibrahim, were among the 5,000 people who followed the hearse on its last journey.

The Prime Minister, Tengku Abdul Rahman, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, and the Governor, Raja Tun Uda Al-Haj, were among those who sent wreaths. Crowds started to gather from an early hour. Before the procession lined up, the coffin was taken out of the Heah mansion, Goodwood, in Macalister Road, and laid on the lawn where representatives of various schools and organisations paid their last respects to the late Mr. Heah. Mr. Yeo Hui Tung, a leader of the Teochew community, then read out an eulogy. Although timed to start at 11.30 a.m., the procession could not get moving until 12.15 p.m. Led by Senator Cheah Seng Khim and other members of the funeral committee, it proceeded along Macalister Road to the Church of Seven Sorrows where the first stage of the procession broke up.

The hearse, followed by 200 cars, then proceeded to Mount Erskine Cemetery where the burial took place at 5. p.m. after full Buddhist rites. Three school bands—St. Xavier's corps of drums and the Han Chiang and Jit Sin High School bands—marched with the procession. Among the 15 political parties, local guilds and associations which took part were UMNO and MCA youths, MCA women, UMNO and MIC members, the Teochew Hoay Kuan, the Kwangtung and Tengchow Associations, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Rubber Trade Association.

The transaction was the biggest of its kind up to that time involved property in the Kota Tinggi area and included Pengerang (4,632 acres), Senti (7,711), Belungkor (813), Telok Sengat (8,173), Sungei Ambok (843), Nanyo (3,089), Asahi (1,079), Sungei Seluyut (574), Tanjong Buai (132), and Buntu (425).The Straits Times, 6 October 1951, Page 4 This, on top of everything else he had done, pushed him to the forefront of the rubber business. He also actively led the industry to resolve issues. In February 1951 he convened and presided over a meeting of Penang merchants, both European and Asian, at the Penang Rubber Exchange to address the breakdown in discussions between the Penang Employers' Association and the owners of local lighters, the latter of whom were demanding a 25 percent increase in rates. The breakdown between the parties had negatively affected the trade of Penang. The matter, now being brought back to the table was resolved, and trading resumed. He advocated finding new uses for natural rubber including laying rubber roads and rubber flooring in offices. At a dinner hosted by the Penang Rubber Trade Association on 18 March 1961 to celebrate his Johan Mangku Negara award from the King, Joo Seang, then still the President of the association, said he would still be engaged in the rubber trade if he had to live his life over. \\"It is a fascinating game in which one has to pit one's brains against the world.\\" He had been connected to the organisation for a long time, having first served that body as Honorary Secretary, forty (40) years earlier.The Straits Times, 21 March 1961, Page 6The Straits Times, 11 March 1961, Page 5 =Public roles= Who's Who in Malaya 1939: A Biographical Record of Prominent Members of Malaya's Community in Official, Professional and Commercial Circles, Singapore: Fishers Ltd (1939) provides a summary of the varied roles that Joo Seang played in Malaya:Chua 2008, 34 * Member Chinese Advisory Board, Penang (1931) * Municipal Commissioner, Georgetown (1931–1932) * Editor and Proprietor of the Malayan Chinese Review (1931–1933) He was also * Vice-President and later President of the Old Xaverians' AssociationMalayan Saturday Post, 5 July 1930, Page 37HPP 1986, 67 * Honorary Secretary, Penang Chinese Unemployed Relief Fund, 1930The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884–1942), 26 November 1930, Page 10 * President, Penang Rubber Exchange, (he was Vice- President in 1936)The Straits Times, 6 July 1936, Page 17 * President, Overseas Chinese Association (1940s) * President of the Straits Chinese British Association (SCBA), PenangChua 2008, 23 * Chairman of the Penang People's Education Association * Justice of the PeaceThe Straits Times, 9 February 1952, Page 2 * President Hu Yew Seah * President All Blues Club * Chairman, Phor Tay Institution * Member of the Federation Industrial Court * Member of the Rubber Study Group Committee * Member of the Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board * President, Penang Chinese Swimming Club, 1953The Straits Times, 2 January 1953, Page 11 * Head of the special committee to investigate the possibility of opening a school for the deaf in the Federation * Chairman, St. Xavier's Building Fund, 1953The Straits Times, 30 August 1953, Page 11 * Chairman, United Nations Association of Malaya, 1954The Straits Times, 18 July 1954, Page 11 * Federal Councillor, 1954–1955The Straits Times, 30 September 1954, Page 7 * President of the Penang Party Negara, 1954The Straits Times, 18 October 1954, Page 1 * Member of the committee appointed by the S.C.B.A. to seek clarification on the status of the \\"Queen's Chinese\\" in a new and independent Malaya, 1956 – the other members being Koh Sin Hock, Khoo Eng Cheang, Ong Joo Sun and Cheah Phee Aik.The Straits Times, 26 February 1956, Page 3 * President of the Badminton Association of Malaya (1952–1959) and Vice-President of and Malayan Representative to the Asian Badminton Confederation, 1959The Straits Times, 30 July 1959, Page 12 * Chairman of the Penang National Mosque Fund Committee, 1959The Straits Times, 26 August 1959, Page 7 * Chairman of the St. Xavier's Institution Building Fund Committee, 1961The Straits Times, 20 July 1961, Page 9 * President of the Penang Branch of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA), 1961The Straits Times, 7 November 1961, Page 11 He was also President, Li Tek Siah; President, Chinese Benevolent Association; President, Rubber Trade Association; President, Federation of Malaya Rubber Trade Association, Member of the Board of Managers of St. Xavier's Institution, Chairman, Han Chiang School and bore office among very many other organisations. =The Reid Commission= On August 1956, Heah Joo Seang hosted a dinner at his residence (the Goodwood mansion) in MacAlister road, Georgetown, Penang, in honour of the visit of Lord William Reid.

This oral tradition serves to explain the history of Rwandan dynasties in poetic form. It is one of four major royal traditions of the Kingdom of Rwanda alongside ubwiru (royal rituals) and the oral literature forms ubucurabwenge (royal genealogies typically recited at coronation ceremonies) and ibisigo (royal poems). Ethnographers Jean Hiernaux and Emma Maquet recorded several major ibitekerezo. Features Ibitekerezo were officially composed court histories recounted through song, and accompanied by a musical instrument. These poems were of two types based on their composition, either in verse or in prose. The name Ibitekerezo is derived from the Kinyarwanda verb gutekereza, which means \\"to recount, reflect, or consider\\". Before Rwanda was colonized by the Germans in the late 19th century and later the Belgians after World War I, the history of the national heroes of Rwanda was known to the people through Ibitekerezo. The stories of these hero figures included key events in the reigns of historic and mythical kings of the Tutsi dynasty (ibisigo), as well as the monarchs' military victories and the warrior figures who won major battles for the king. The poems served as records of royal history and were preserved by the court's bards. Young men at court undergoing training to become part of the king's military guard (intore) were required to learn these poems as part of their induction into this privileged class. They were also required to compose pieces of poetry with similar aesthetic qualities and emphasis on narrative. Performances The songs of ibitekerezo were performed from memory and written in verses. In addition to recounting the histories of kings and battles, ibitekerezo include songs in praise of the current king as well as cows, which were glorified in traditional Rwandan society. The Abiru (court musicians and ritualists) were primarily responsible for producing and performing these songs to entertain and honor the king and to protect the general populace from evil spirits. They were also performed to entertain at ceremonies for marriage, harvest and courtship. Some of the musical elements of the ibitekerezo tradition have been blended into modern Rwandan church music.

Her works include public pieces installed at the Vancouver International Airport, Stanley Park, the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington D.C., the U.B.C. Museum of Anthropology, the Penn Museum in Philadelphia, and the city of Seattle. Point was born in Alert Bay while her parents, Edna Grant and Anthony Point were salmon fishing. She grew up with her family in their home on the Musqueam Indian Reserve. In the early 1980s, she joined a group of artists interested in reviving the traditions of Coast Salish art and design, including artists such as Stan Greene, Rod Modeste, and Floyd Joseph. Little research had been done on Salish art, so Point taught herself the Salish traditions. She studied the collections of Coast Salish art at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology and the Royal British Columbia Museum. There is broad agreement that Point's works were critical to the current efflorescence of contemporary Coast Salish art. She was a leader in expanding the audience for Salish art to a market that was heavily biased towards Northwest Coast artworks produced in northern Northwest Coast formline design principles. Her close study of the formal characteristics of historical works of Salish art laid the foundation for her contemporary productions - some based closely on new renderings in print form of historical spindle whorls in museum collections, and later expanding out into original forms in new media, such as glass, concrete, and bronze. Much of her art practice has involved the adaptation of traditional spindle whorl carvings into the medium of screen printing. Her work helped revive Coast Salish design and brought new scholarly attention to her culture. She has produced more prints than any other artist on the Coast, with over 360 prints in her oeuvre by 2016. For several decades in the late 1990s and early 21st century, she completed a major public work in B.C. or Seattle, a series of prints and works in glass each year. Vancouver Airport Inside A major retrospective of her work was shown by the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2017, Susan Point: Spindle Whorl.  Works  Musqueam House Post Her works include Salish Footprint in the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, Musqueam house posts at the American Museum of Natural History, and carvings installed at the Vancouver International Airport and at Brockton Point in Stanley Park. In 1995, Susan Point's \\"Flight (Spindle Whorl)\\" was installed at the Vancouver International Airport. It is the largest spindle whorl in the world at 4.8 meters (16 feet) in diameter. The piece is set against a stone waterfall to symbolize the connection between land and sky. Since 2014, the Penn Museum of the University of Pennsylvania has displayed a glass whorl by Susan Point, made in 1994, in its \\"Native American Voices: The People – Here and Now\\" exhibit. In 2008, Point created \\"Buttress Runnels\\" for the Olympic Oval in Richmond, B.C.. The runnels move water from the roof of the building away from the site. The runnels include cast images of the life of the Fraser River, including fish, sand, herons. Herons are the symbol of the City of Richmond and figure prominently in stories and histories of the Musqueam people. In 2009, Point’s “Tree of Life” stained glass window was installed in Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver. The design represents the Salish belief in the interconnectedness of all forms of life, uniting Christian theology with First Nations culture and merging the traditional with the modern. Point was commissioned by the church to design the windows after winning a competition.

Someone is shown covering up the crime. =Present day= Saga (Aadhi Pinisetty), a regular, middle-class college student from Chennai arrives in Mumbai to meet Mudaliar (Mithun Chakraborty), the city's underworld don and protector of the poor. At around the same time, Mudaliar is rushed to the hospital after he is almost killed in an assassination attempt. A mob assembles before his house and demands he show up to prove he is alive. When he finally does appear, the crowd is grateful for his survival and pray for his well-being. =Four months ago= Saga and his three wealthy friends purposely skip their finals so that they can continue to stay in college and enjoy themselves rather than face adulthood. Despite being warned by his parents to stay away from his friends as they are a bad influence on him, Saga hangs out with them. He finally decides to turn over a new life after Kayal (Nikki Galrani), the girl he falls in love with, convinces his father that Saga can be a responsible adult if given the chance. His parents then put him in charge of his sister's wedding arrangements before leaving for their hometown to meet relatives. =31 December 2014= With his family out of town, Saga follows his three friends for a night in the city to celebrate New Year's Eve. At a restaurant, two of his friends are drunk and get into a fight with a girl named Priya and her boyfriend, Surya. When the police come to resolve the ruckus, they realise that Saga's fourth friend is the son of the police commissioner and decides to arrest Surya instead. Priya protests and is publicly humiliated by the police inspector, without knowing who she is. She then warns Saga and his friends to go into hiding as they will not live to see the light of day. =1 January 2015= By midnight, Saga and his friends come to know that Priya is actually the daughter of Mudaliar. Her brother, Guna, who runs Mudaliar's businesses in Chennai is after them for revenge. Saga's friends try to convince him to follow them into hiding as arranged by their wealthy and influential fathers, but he insists on staying to arrange for his sister's wedding. Later that morning, Saga is chased down by Guna's men while in town. He is finally saved by Deva, Guna's henchman who realises that Saga saved his brother's life once. Deva advises Saga to go to Mumbai to meet Mudaliar in person and explain everything since he is a sensible man, unlike Guna. =Present day= Saga goes to Mudaliar's home and claims that Guna sent him. When it is discovered he is lying, he is tortured since he is suspected for the assassination attempt on Mudaliar. Saga finally gets to meet Mudaliar and explains the truth of what happened that night in Chennai. However, Mudaliar drops a bombshell by saying that after Priya bailed out Surya from the police station that night, both of them went missing and have not been seen since. Since Saga and his friends were the last to see the couple alive, they are the prime suspects. Saga refuses to reveal his friends' whereabouts until Mudaliar threatens to have his family killed. Mudaliar then gives Saga some time to find his friends or else his family will die. With Kayal and Deva's help, Saga finds out where his friends are hiding. In between, Saga is being attacked by a person in a purdah. As Saga cannot see his face, he is unable to catch his attacker. Saga goes into hiding as he suspects that he is being targeted by the father of one of his friends, in order to keep their identities safe. The attacker then tries to kill Deva and runs away. In the process, he begins to suspect that their fathers are trying to frame him for Priya's disappearance to save their sons. This forces Saga to reveal his friends' hideouts to Mudaliar, who releases his family. Saga then visits Deva in the hospital who is receiving treatment. Deva hands Saga a paper that has a symbol and says the attacker had this symbol tattooed in his hand. After much thinking, Saga realises that he saw such a tattoo on Surya's forearm and he might know about Priya's whereabouts and goes to his flat. Once there, he finds Surya's frozen body being kept by Surya's psychotic ex- girlfriend, Nila who also has the same tattoo on her hand. It is then revealed that she killed both Surya and Priya on New Year's Eve out of jealousy. Before Saga can take Nila to meet Mudaliar, she is killed by Deva's brother, leaving Saga with no alternative to convince the don of the truth. At around the same time, Mudaliar and Guna find Priya's body washed up on the beach. Once his men have rounded up Saga and his friends, Mudaliar orders Guna and their men to kill them. However, the friend who tried to hit on Priya and caused the whole misunderstanding finally admits his mistake to Mudaliar and pleads for his friends' release in return for his life. Moved by the young man's deed, Mudaliar lets the four friends go as he realises they couldn't have killed his daughter as they were willing to sacrifice their life for their friends.

Yaagavarayinum Naa Kaakka belongs in the latter category\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"when the film does eventually begin in the second half, there's quite a lot to like...Some subtlety could've been nice towards the end, as there's too much emotion being milked with over-the-top performances and extra-poignant loud music. But that's not really the film’s biggest problem. It is that it doesn't start until you return from the interval break\\". Behindwoods rated the film 2.75 out of 5 and felt \\"it was one movie that’s justified by everything in store to define it with the parliamentary term called commercial cinema, but also creates an impactful experience in the end.\\"They lauded actor Mithun Chakraborty saying \\"Mithun Da anchored the film on one side with his mightiness\\". Sify called the film \\"average\\" and wrote, \\"too many songs look unnecessary and the length of the film is a drawback...everything about the film feels rehashed and redundant\\". Indiaglitz gave the Telugu version of the film, a rating of 3/5 stars, calling it as a one time watch mystery film with gripping screenplay, especially in the second half, appreciating the performances of Richa Pallod, Mithun Chakraborty, Aadhi Pinisetty and Pasupathy. They also lauded the technical crew of the film.

This song used the \\"Kukunkun\\"/\\"Poco Man Jam\\" riddim (based on the title of the 1990 Gregory Peck song and Red Dragon) created by Jamaican producers Steely & Clevie in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Elements of the song's riddim has been incorporated into over 80% of all reggaeton productions. Evidently, “Dem Bow” has shaped and informed transnational flows and shifts within the genre over time. Reggaeton articulates a particular “audible thread” that weaves together various flows (and waves) of music, people, and ideologies. In examining this musical evolution, aspects of race, class, and culture are inextricably linked to sociocultural elements surrounding the genre. In harnessing “Dem Bow” as a point of centrality, this song speaks to various patterns of migration, commercialization, branding, and reforming within the context of reggaeton. The History of Dem Bow remixes After its release, \\"Dem Bow\\" was then transnationally remixed and covered, and it is in these slight sonic alterations that the pan-Latin cultural metamorphosis is revealed. In 1991, Nando Boom and El General released their covers of \\"Dem Bow\\", \\"Ellos Benia\\" and \\"Son Bow\\", which translated Shabba's original lyrics from English to Spanish. Additionally, the word “bow” was transformed from a verb describing illicit sexuality to a noun used to label a gay person as a social pariah. Other Dem Bow remixes of the mid-'90s originated from Puerto Rico and New York in the form of long, 30-minute mixtapes that fused digital samples of hip-hop, dancehall and the riddim of reggaeton hits. These chopped up mixes of reggaeton and hip-hop created a new intercultural space of blackness within the urban diaspora of New York and San Juan. Additionally, while the introduction of accessible digital production tools widened the inter-diasporic sonic conversation across genres, it also provided a mechanism for the widespread commercialization of reggaeton into reggaeton pop. As seen in Wisin & Yandel's 2003 version of Dem Bow, while there is a remnant of the original riddim, Ranks' political message of anti- colonialism and homophobia is erased and transformed into a song about sensuality. Although there is no explicit retention of these political messages, there is a retention of the implicit \\"macho pose\\" of Shabba Ranks. Instead of expressing this machismo through homophobia Dem Bow expresses it through the traditional form of objectifying women. In considering these transnational exchanges, there were a variety of factors that fed into the shaping and popularization of reggaeton. The 1990s to early 2000s marked a key shift within the genre. There was an evident erasure of black diasporic roots. For example, in the mid 1990s, the genre was often referred to as “musica negra” or just hip-hop/reggae; however, as the genre grew and popularized, it became more widely known as “reggaeton Latino.” This shift in branding during the early 2000s was coined as “blanqueamiento” or whitening. Thus, the sanitization of reggaeton was marked by this intentional movement away from blackness. There are various influences that produce this genre as they extend across Jamaican, Panamanian, Puerto Rican, and US culture. While there is existing controversy over which artists/groups can claim ownership over reggaeton, “Dem Bow” embodied the base culture that centered and informed the shaping of reggaeton. The history of this musical evolution starts with transnational exchanges between Jamaica and Panama. Many were influenced by Anglo-Caribbean migrant workers who resided in Panama in the late 1970s, and in turn Panamanian artists were the first to perform reggae in Spanish. Often earlier covers of “Dem Bow” were lyrically very exact in meaning and translation. However, during these translations there was a significant change of the use of the word \\"bow\\" from a verb to a noun. In the original Dem Bow song by Shabba Ranks bow was used as a verb trying to persuade listeners to not bow to foreign influence. In El General's song entitled Son Bow, \\"bow\\" is used as a noun and not a verb. Evidently, there was a clear audible engagement with Jamaican riddims, narratives, and socio-political life. These translations and connections were further complicated by expressions of anti- colonial resistance and anti-gay sentiment in the genre. In turn, this speaks to persisting assertions and disidentifications of cultural narratives and histories surrounding black sexual and gender identities. In looking beyond Panama, Puerto Rico is often recognized as the place where reggaeton was “crystallized.\\" Puerto Rican artists in New York specifically reformed the genre as a hybrid site of hip-hop and reggae––grounding the music in “reference” rather than “reverence” to “Dem Bow.\\" This soundscape cultivated a musical fusion that recontextualized reggaeton in the space of the Bronx/ El Barrio. All in all, the “mezcla” of reggaeton is produced by a fusion that is rooted in black diasporic musical exchange. As evidenced by the transnational flow and influence stemming from “Dem Bow,” reggaeton provides a unique soundscape that amalgamates a multitude of identities, histories, and cultures. A recent revamp of \\"Dembow\\" by reggaeton artist Yandel, featuring Rauw Alejandro, appeared in July 2020 on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S416I8QyyFc References * Marshall, Wayne. \\"Dem Bow, Dembow, Dembo: Translation and Transnation in Reggaeton\\" Lied und populäre Kultur/Song and Popular Culture 53 (2008): 131-51.

Doug was introduced by executive producer Don Battye as the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. Donovan explained that being part of \\"a loving family\\" was one of the main reasons he accepted the role. He said he was happy to stay around for as long as the producers wanted him. Donovan made his first screen appearance as Doug during the episode broadcast on 18 July 1990. Doug was portrayed as a man's man, down-to-earth, easy-going and friendly. Doug was a builder, who loved his family and enjoyed spending time with his friends. Despite being \\"an easy touch\\" as a father, Doug could balance understanding with discipline. Doug and his wife, Pam (Sue Jones) had a solid marriage until they began to neglect each other due to work. When Doug thought Pam was having an affair with their neighbour Jim Robinson (Alan Dale), he ended up having a one-night stand with Jill Weir (Lyn Semler). Doug's father, Bert (Bud Tingwell), was introduced in 1993. They had had a difficult relationship but Doug made amends with his father when he learned he was dying. Shortly after, Doug got into debt and lost his job, causing him to sink into a deep depression. One of Doug's last storylines saw him suffer a health scare in which he had to undergo an emergency operation. The character departed on 15 September 1994, after being written out. In July 2005, Donovan reprised his role as part of the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. He reprised the role again in April 2014 and Doug came to Ramsay Street to visit his family. He was also diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Doug continued to make guest appearances until his death in April 2016, with his storylines mostly focusing on the progression of his Alzheimer's and how it affects him and his family. Casting Following a short stint in rival Australian soap opera Home and Away, Donovan joined the cast of Neighbours in 1990. He was cast in the role of Doug, the patriarch of the newly introduced Willis family. The family aspect was one of the main reasons Donovan accepted the part. He told Chris Pritchard from Woman's Own, \\"I'm very pro that sort of thing. Having been part of two families that broke up in real life, it's nice to be in a loving family – even if it's only make- believe.\\" Donovan added that he was enjoying his time with the show and was happy to stay for as long as the producers wanted him. He made his first screen appearance on 18 July 1990. The actor's son, Jason, previously appeared in the show as Scott Robinson from 1985 to 1989. Development =Characterisation= Upon his introduction, Doug was a self-employed builder and \\"affable fortysomething\\". He made extra money by buying and doing up houses, before selling them on. Despite this hobby being \\"unsettling\\" for his family in the past, they decided that the house he purchased in Ramsay Street should be their permanent residence. Doug loved his family and enjoyed spending time drinking with his friends. In his book, The Who's Who of Soap Operas, Anthony Haywood described Doug as being a \\"rugged and down-to-earth builder\\", who is usually easy-going but does have \\"an awful temper\\" when provoked.Haywood 1991, p.162. A writer for the official Neighbours website called Doug a Regular Joe, who did not like standing out in a crowd. Haywood wrote that Doug's warmth and sense of humour made him popular with his co- workers and friends. Doug also had a habit of flirting with attractive women but it was perfectly innocent. Doug was \\"an easy touch\\" as a father but he could balance understanding with discipline. Doug often doubted his eldest son Adam's (Ian Williams) determination but he got on well with Brad (Scott Michaelson). Doug hoped to pass his business onto one of his sons but was disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm from them both. He was \\"baffled\\" by Gaby's (Rachel Blakely) rebellious nature, while Cody (Amelia Frid), his youngest child, was the apple of his eye and often came to him with her problems instead of her mother. =Marriage to Pam Beresford= When Doug accepted a dare to travel naked across town in a taxi, his future wife Pam Beresford (Sue Jones) was the driver. The couple soon married and had four children; Adam, Gaby, Brad and Cody.Monroe 1996, p.55. When Pam wanted to return to work, Doug was \\"appalled\\" as he liked the idea of providing for her and wondered who would provide him with his meals. Pam and Doug's seemingly solid marriage soon ran into trouble when they began to neglect each other due to work. Doug was devoting his time to his construction business, while Pam's job as a district nurse gave her increasing independence. Jones said she was not surprised that Pam and Doug were having problems. When Pam began nursing Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) through his heart problems, she became attracted to him. Meanwhile, Doug had attracted the unwelcome attentions of the lonely and \\"dogged\\" Jill Weir (Lyn Semler), who was dealing with the death of her son, Ross (Che Broadbent). Doug's feelings of \\"vulnerability\\" made him an easy target for Jill, who saw him as the perfect partner and was determined to get him. With Doug believing Pam was having an affair with Jim, he had a one-night stand with Jill. Doug regretted it immediately but Jill was keen for it to happen again. An Inside Soap columnist questioned whether the Willis marriage would survive and Jones explained \\"I think it's worth saving. If Doug and Pam have any sense, they'll sort things out. Who knows? They might even end up with a stronger relationship than they had before.\\" The following year, while Pam was going through menopause, she began to feel that Doug was paying more attention to the cement mixer then he was to her. So, she was pleased to meet Tom Weaver (George Mallaby) at an art class. Tom made his interest in Pam clear and asked her to marry him in front of Doug. Refusing to believe that nothing had happened between Tom and his wife, a \\"horrified\\" Doug packed his bag and moved out. After Tom spoke to Doug, he moved back in. =Reuniting with Bert= Doug had a difficult relationship with his father Bert (Bud Tingwell), which made him determined to always be around for his children.Monroe 1996, p.53. When Gaby revealed that she had been writing to her grandfather for years, behind Doug's back, it almost caused a division within the family. Doug had not seen his father since he had walked out on the family when Doug was young. When Pam and Gaby announced that they had invited Bert to stay, Doug forbid them from letting him in the house. At first he refused to tell them why and Pam and Gaby believed that they could re-build the relationship between father and son. An Inside Soap writer commented \\"But they've got to work fast because times's not on their side.\\" There was \\"instant friction\\" between Bert and Doug when they finally met. When Bert tried to explain his actions, Doug refused to forgive him for walking out on his mother.Monroe 1994, p.119. Bert later confided in Wayne Duncan (Jonathon Sammy-Lee) that he was dying and had come to Erinsborough to make amends. Realising that Doug was not going to give Bert a chance, Wayne told him about Bert's condition. However, Bert did not want Doug's pity and made plans to leave on the next boat but Pam persuaded him to return, where he and Doug made up. =Debt and depression= After getting into debt and losing his job, Doug sank into a deep depression. The storyline began during a few months that were \\"fraught with anxiety\\" for both Doug and Pam. Shortly after Brad was left at the altar by his fiancée Beth Brennan (Natalie Imbruglia). Doug bore some abuse when it was discovered that he had known about Brad's affair with Lauren Carpenter (Sarah Vandenbergh). Doug's business seemed to be doing well but nobody was aware of \\"the lack of care\\" Doug had been playing to the books. When he and Pam learned that they owed $70,000 in unpaid taxes and fines, the business \\"came crashing down.\\" This resulted in Doug having no option but to sell the business to rival company Constructocon, who bought it and Doug's reputation for a fraction of their real value. Donovan explained \\"Things look really bleak for the Willis family right now. Doug can't see any way out of this mess and he's not facing up to things at all.\\" On the orders of his new boss, Mr Baker (Fred Barker), Doug had to take on his nephew – Terry (Adam McInnes) – a lazy \\"good-for-nothing\\", who had no interest in the business. Doug ended up firing Terry in a fit of anger but Baker forced him to re-hire Terry, after threatening him with the sack. The situation was made worse when Doug was finally fired and Donovan commented that it was a nightmare time for Doug, adding \\"He loved his business and now things have spiralled out of control.\\" While Pam tried her best to comfort Doug, she grew concerned when he started to drown his sorrows with alcohol. =Health scare= During June 1994, Doug found himself going to the toilet more often than normal, leading him to become worried about his health. Thinking something could be seriously wrong, he realised that he needed medical help but then refused to let the doctor examine him because she was female. It was down to Pam to convince him to let go of his \\"masculine pride\\" and allow the doctor to take a look. Doug learned that the problem was due to his prostate and was told that he needed to undergo an emergency operation. He initially refused and Pam had to convince him to change his mind in time to prevent the problem getting any worse. =Departure and 2005 return= By mid-September 1994, Doug, Pam and Cody were the only members of the Willis family left in the show. Doug and Pam were written out and replaced by the new five-strong Kennedy family.Mercado 2004, p.221. The couple left Erinsborough for Darwin when Doug was offered some building work with the hotel run by Gaby.Johnston 2005, p.220. On 14 April 2005, Kris Green from Digital Spy confirmed that Donovan would be reprising his role for a guest appearance as part of the Neighbours 20th anniversary celebrations, which were broadcast in July. =Return and Alzheimer's diagnosis= In February 2014, Neighbours producers stated that two cast members featured in a photo taken in 1992 would be returning to the show. On 14 March, it was confirmed that Donovan would once again be reprising the role of Doug for a guest stint. His return aired from 9 April 2014. Donovan commented, \\"It is very exciting to be coming back as the same character after all these years and I always loved the Doug Willis character. And I love the fact that he is a builder and he is encouraging his young grandson [Josh] to have a trade and be proud of what you do – I think that's very important.\\" Doug returned to Ramsay Street to visit Brad (now played by Kip Gamblin) and his family. During his stay with Brad, Doug got the chance to teach his grandson Josh (Harley Bonner) some practical skills and \\"the ropes of the building trade\\". While Doug and Josh were working together, Lou passed on a building job to them but Doug made \\"a potentially expensive mistake\\" when he did not remember it. Josh noticed further issues with Doug's memory and became worried about his grandfather but Brad tried to assure him that nothing was wrong and Doug was just being a bit forgetful. Doug was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Brad had to call Pam to join them in Erinsborough. However, when Pam arrived she refused to believe the diagnosis, instead she was convinced that Doug had been having an affair because of his secretive behaviour. Donovan said that Doug had been like that as he was afraid to admit what was happening to him. Doug and Pam reunited and were forced to confront his condition. Donovan praised the plot, saying it was \\"a great opportunity to bring to the fore some issues that affect older people.\\" The actor was also asked to be an ambassador for Alzheimer's Australia as a result of the storyline. Doug returned to visit his family again in November 2014. The following year, Doug returned to meet his great-granddaughter Matilda (Eloise Simbert), following the realisation that his health was declining. Producers used Doug's return to show \\"the growing epidemic of Alzheimer's disease\\". Donovan was pleased to reprise his role for the storyline, saying \\"I think Neighbours is a wonderful forum to raise the subject to young people so that they are aware of what older people are coping with. Nearly all families are going to be impacted by it in the future.\\" Doug returned on 8 February 2016, after Pam realised that she could no longer cope with looking after him. Doug moved in Brad and Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall), marking the first time he had lived on Ramsay Street in 21 years. Due to his condition, Doug quickly lost his temper with Lauren and sought out Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou). In February 2016, Donovan's son Jason confirmed that his father had wrapped his stint on the show. In his exit storyline, Doug collapsed shortly after witnessing Brad reunite with his estranged son Ned (Ben Hall). Despite Karl Kennedy's (Alan Fletcher) efforts to revive him, Doug died outside Lassiter's Hotel. He then appeared as a ghost \\"in a heartwarming moment\\" as he smiled at Brad and Ned, before walking away. After Doug's last scenes were aired, Donovan admitted that he was sad and unimpressed at how his character was written out of the show. He commented, \\"Look, it's not the way I'd have liked to do it from the point of view of coming out of the series. But, the producers did it a different way and it's their story and their show.\\" He went on to praise Doug's Alzheimer's storyline, saying it was important that the show focused on social issues as well as love stories. Storylines After his father walked out, Doug was left to support his mother and sister, Faye (Lorraine Bayly). During a friend's bucks night, Doug accepted a dare to travel across town in a taxi naked. The taxi driver turned out to be Pam Beresford, who Doug fell in love with. He and Pam married and had five children, four of whom survived. When Doug does some work on Number 28 Ramsay Street in preparation for a sale, he decides to purchase the house and the family move to Erinsborough. Doug becomes good friends with Joe Mangel (Mark Little), Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) and Jim Robinson, even though they get off to a bad start when Doug flirts with Jim's wife. When Doug's eldest son, Adam, quits medicine, Doug believes he can pass his construction business onto him. However, when he realises that Adam is not really into it, Doug makes his time on the site difficult, forcing Adam to go back to his studies. Doug goes into partnership with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and they plan to build a retirement village in the bush. Councillor Felicity Brent (Rhona McLeod) threatens to vote against the development but fails and work begins. The project eventually collapses, leaving Doug and Paul in debt. Doug and Pam's financial troubles continue due to Cody's student exchange fees and them having to bail Brad out of jail. Just as they being thinking about selling the house, Gaby tricks one of Doug's debtors into paying up. Doug befriends Brenda Riley (Genevieve Lemon) and she falls in love with him. Brenda kisses Doug, which Gaby witnesses and she tells Pam. Doug explains that he is not having an affair and then tells Brenda that he never felt anything other than friendship towards her. Doug's sister, Faye, comes to stay and Doug puts up with her because she is lonely. When Faye invites Doug's childhood sweetheart, Alexandra Lomax (Chantal Contouri), for a visit, Doug asks her to leave. Faye moves into Number 32 instead. Doug's photo appears in the local newspaper and it is spotted by Jill Weir. She befriends Doug and Pam, who support her in her custody battle for her son, Ross. When Ross dies, she relies on Doug and Pam. Doug realises that Jill is attracted to him but Pam fails to notice. When Doug assumes Pam and Jim are having an affair, he has a one-night stand with Jill. Doug immediately regrets it and tells Pam, who throws him out and files for divorce. However, when Doug and Brad are lost at sea, Pam realises how much she loves him and they reconcile. When Gaby is almost raped by Simon Hunter (Frederick Whitlock), Doug tracks him down and hits him. Simon threatens to sue Doug for assault if Gaby reports him to the police, so she is forced to drop the matter. Doug's father, Bert, turns up after Gaby reveals that she has been writing to him. Bert tries to make amends with his son but Doug refuses to forgive him. When Doug learns Bert is dying, he decides to make peace with him. Doug is given the contract to rebuild the Waterhole but before work can begin his company is audited and discovered to be in debt to the tax department, leaving Doug no choice but to sell it to Constructocon. The company keep Doug on but he is eventually fired. Doug sinks into a deep depression and begins drinking. Things begin to improve when Doug finds a job as a sales representative for a building supplier. Doug and Pam learn that they actually paid the money they were supposed to have owed to the tax department and receive a refund. Doug uses the money to buy a house to do up and he sells it to the council, who ask him to do further renovations to the property. Doug finds himself in trouble with Andrew \\"Macca\\" MacKenzie (John Morris) when he and Lou begin brewing their own beer in the shed at the property but Macca eventually joins them. Gaby gives birth to a son, Zac (Jay Callahan), who is named after Doug's grandfather and she leaves to run a hotel in Darwin. A few weeks later, she contacts Doug and offers him some building work on the hotel. Doug and Pam decide to sell up and they leave Erinsborough. Cody stays behind to continue her studies. A year later, Cody is shot and Pam returns to be with her, while Doug stays behind as he is the middle of a big building contract. When Cody comes round, Doug speaks with her on the phone. However, Cody takes a turn for the worse and dies. Pam takes her body back to Darwin where she and Doug bury her. In July 2005, Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies) invites Doug to attend a screening of her documentary about Ramsay Street. Doug returns with Philip Martin (Ian Rawlings) and they sneak into Number 22 and paint a beard onto a sleeping Lou's face. After watching the documentary, Lou joins Doug and Philip on a fishing trip up north. In April 2014, Doug comes to visit Brad and his family on Ramsay Street. Doug also wants to teach his grandson, Josh, the basics of the building trade. Doug catches up with Lou and they decide to start making some of their home brew. Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) hires Doug to cover for her grandson at his yard, and he accepts. Brad's wife, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), suspects Doug prefers Beth to her but Doug assures Brad that it is not the case. Terese later notices that Doug appears to be forgetting things but Brad puts it down to old age. Josh also becomes concerned when Doug messes up a couple of jobs, leaves the yard unattended and gives Imogen (Ariel Kaplan) alcoholic ginger beer by mistake. When Doug stays out all night, he is found injured and talking about meeting Cody. Josh accompanies Doug to the hospital and tests show Doug has early onset Alzheimer's disease. Pam comes down to see Doug and does not initially believe the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, thinking that Doug has been having an affair. She is convinced of Doug's illness and vows to stand by her husband. Brad and Terese asks Pam and Doug to move in with them but Pam and Doug reject the offer to go travelling. Doug returns a few months later to support Josh ahead of his court case for punching Chris Pappas (James Mason). Josh takes Doug to the park to play cricket, so he has positive memories of him in case he is sent to jail. Doug meets his granddaughter Paige (Olympia Valance) for the first time. He mentions that Brad and Lauren might have stayed together if they had known that Paige was alive but realises he has made a mistake and apologises for upsetting Terese. Doug later gifts Paige an ankle bracelet to welcome her to the family. Doug briefly goes missing and is found in Number 28, his old home. He later teaches Josh and Paige some woodwork skills. When Doug learns Imogen is not attending her school formal, he organises a family formal for her instead. He tells her she can call him anytime, before he leaves for Darwin the next day. The following year, Doug returns to meet Josh's newborn daughter Matilda and stay with his family for Christmas. He gives Paige a commitment ring to give to her boyfriend Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor). Doug runs Paul's car off the road, causing him and his passenger Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) to crash. Josh realises what Doug did and tries to protect him. Steph agrees not to report Doug to the police if he agrees to stop driving. Doug and Lou team up to get Josh and Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) talking about their daughter's future. Doug announces that he is going home and laments that it might be the last time he remembers who everyone is. He pays a visit to Lou, before leaving for Darwin. After Doug accidentally sets fire to his house, Pam decides she can no longer take care of him. Brad and Lauren offer to let Doug move in with them but Doug disapproves of Brad and Lauren's relationship and is rude to Lauren. He goes to see Terese and she calms him down, before encouraging him to accept Brad and Lauren's relationship, and he apologises to them. Paul convinces Doug to invest in his plan to renovate a run-down motel. Doug goes for a drive with Susan during a heatwave. The car breaks down because Doug put water in the oil. Doug walks away and Susan collapses with heatstroke. Imogen later finds Susan, who is taken to hospital.

History  Kosgoda was traditionally associated with the cultivation, fishing and production of cinnamon. Prior to the arrival of Europeans the Sinhala kings had been long been trading in cinnamon, with Sri Lanka's cinnamon considered to be the world's finest, selling on the European markets at a high price. The highest quality cinnamon coming from around Negombo, Colombo, Kalutara and Galle. The Portuguese were initially satisfied with the cinnamon produced by the Kotte kingdom, which had a royal monopoly on the trade. They subsequently increased cinnamon collection, with each cinnamon peeler required to provide a specified quantity of cinnamon. The various cinnamon workers, such as collectors and peelers, were tightly organized. Welitara and Kosgoda were reserved for the Chaliyas, who were obliged to collect cinnamon. When the Dutch defeated the Portuguese in 1658, the Dutch East Indies Company took control of the cinnamon trade. In order to increase production the Dutch commenced the domestication cultivation of cinnamon, with cinnamon production moving to the western and southern coastal areas of the island. Following the British taking control of the island from the Dutch in 1796 the cinnamon monopoly moved to their control, however the relative importance of spices in the world market was declining due to the emerging plantation crops such as tea and rubber. Kosgoda is particularly renowned for its sea turtle conservation project operated by the Wildlife Protection Society of Sri Lanka.

Reed (born October 9, 1962) is an American politician and the first ever African-American to be elected president of the Board of Aldermen for the City of St. Louis, Missouri (2007–present). Reed was named one of St. Louis' \\"Most Influential People\\" by the St. Louis Business Journal in 2012. In 2014 Reed became the first area politician to be accepted to the Local Leaders Council of Smart Growth America, \\"a nonpartisan group of municipal officials who share a passion for building great towns, cities, and communities.\\" http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/2012/02/slideshow-most-influential-st- louisans.html?s=image_gallery Education and early career Reed is a native of Joliet, Illinois, where he attended Joliet Central High School. Reed was a force to be reckoned with on the school's varsity wrestling team, which he joined as a freshman. Reed credits his wrestling coaches for helping him 'transform as a person' and attributes lessons learned on the mat for his successful career. Reed would go on to place third in state competition his senior year. After graduating high school, Reed attended Southern Illinois University Edwardsville on a wrestling scholarship. While there, the wrestling program \\"vaulted to national championship status with four individual national champions and eight All-Americans under NCAA Coach of the Year Larry Kristoff.\\" Reed majored in mathematics and computer science. He went on to become the director of networks and telecommunications for the Edison Brothers Stores’ worldwide operations. He also was the manager of data networks for SSM Health Businesses, a billion dollar health care organization and developed technology solutions. Political career Reed was elected alderman of the city's sixth ward in 1999. He was the first African American alderman ever elected to this position. In his term of office, Reed led the revitalization of Lafayette Square and Gate District which were part of the growth of the area including more than $1.7 Billion of investment in redevelopment and economic growth creating more than 400 new jobs.http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/09/21/focus3.html ; Bike St. Louis In 2005 Reed worked with then Congressman Russ Carnahan, being long- time friends and cyclists, to establish Bike St. Louis. Reed felt it was time to create a way to connect the parks in the City for cyclists and to provide safe commuter route options. After months of planning with Alderpersons, constituents, City Agencies, and local bike organizations, the first 20 miles of continuous on-street bicycle routes were unveiled in the Spring of 2005. Signage on the routes is both MUTCD standard signage as well as custom designed signage by Kiku Obata that marks the route and provides point of interest directions and distances. A printed map was also developed and distributed which included bike safety information. In addition an educational program was created and presented to over 30 classes of middle school students. ; Washington Avenue redevelopment During Reed’s two terms as alderman, Washington Avenue went from being a largely abandoned commercial district to, the Washington Avenue Loft District, one of the city’s most active entertainment districts and home to hundreds of new residents living in newly constructed loft apartments. Reed drafted several ordinances to target investment along this historic commercial corridor, using historic tax credits, low-income housing tax credits and, at times, Tax Increment Financing (TIF). ; Designating city parkland for dog parks In 2004, Alderman Reed worked with animal rights and advocacy groups to establish, for the city of St. Louis, rules and regulations to allow for 'dog exercise areas' in existing parks. This ordinance, 66595, paved the way for other alderpersons and community groups to designate areas for dog parks. ; Lafayette Square neighborhood revitalization As alderman, Reed worked with Lafayette Square residents and the City's Parks Department to draft and adopt a comprehensive master plan for the restoration of Lafayette Square Park. That plan was reviewed by and approved by the Planning Commission and ratified by the full Board of Aldermen. Implementation of plan recommendations began immediately and continues to date. Reed also authored and passed the first-ever neighborhood TIF district to spur development on Park Ave., the business district of the neighborhood. Reed then worked with developers to transform an old junk yard into Park Plaza, a public space that features a fountain, benches and green space. The TIF district boundaries have been expanded over the years as development spreads in all directions from the original TIF site. A comprehensive neighborhood 'Urban Plan' guides development in this historic district. That plan, too, was endorsed and adopted by Alderman Reed. President of the Board of Aldermen Reed was elected president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen on April 3, 2007. He is the first Black person in St. Louis history elected to this position. Reed was re-elected on April 5, 2011 with over 80% of the vote. As Board President, Reed sits on the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which approves all City real estate purchases, appropriations and the City's annual operating budget, the Airport Commission, which is responsible for the oversight of all planning, development, management and operation of Lambert International Airport and the East-West Gateway Council of Governments, the Metropolitan planning organizationof the St. Louis region. ; Cyber harassment In response to increased concerns of online bullying, President Reed introduced Board Bill 404 in November 2007 to make cyber harassment illegal in the City of St. Louis with violators subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars and up to 90 days in jail. The bill passed into law with broad support to become Ordinance 67800. The bill defined harass as \\"to engage in a course of conduct that serves no legitimate purpose and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress...or when the conduct consists of contact by a person over age eighteen with a person under the age of eighteen.\\" ; Public Safety Sales Tax and Youth Crime Prevention Fund In 2007 Reed introduced and passed Board Bills 362 and 351, which were codified as Ordinance 67794, and Ordinance 67774, submitting to the voters of the City of St. Louis a one-half of one percent sales tax increase on retail sales for the purpose of \\"providing revenues for the operation of public safety departments of the city including hiring more police officers, police and firefighter compensation, prosecuting more criminals, nuisance crimes and problem properties, and funding police and fire pensions.\\" This \\"Public Safety Protection Sales Tax\\" was approved by voters, passing with 54.95% of votes cast. This sales tax also allocates $1 million annually for Youth Crime Prevention efforts administered by non-profit organizations specializing in early childhood education, youth recreation and the arts. ; Government transparency In October 2013 President Reed co-authored a bill to increase transparency at the Board of Aldermen. Once passed, the Communications Division of the City will be required to record \\"all public meetings of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, including committee meetings; the Board of Estimate & Apportionment; the Board of Public Service; and the Preservation Board.\\" These recordings will be made publicly available online. ; Nextdoor for Neighborhoods Also in late 2013, President Reed joined neighbors from across the city to announce the launch of a new social network designed to link neighbors and strengthen lines of communication between residents and City Hall and residents and the police department. The network, known as Nextdoor, quickly grew with nearly 8,000 residents enrolled by the end of the year. The goal is to keep residents informed, prepared and connected. This partnership is improving engagement with residents among a variety of city departments including the Board of Aldermen, the Police Department, the Emergency Management Agency and the Neighborhood Stabilization Team. ; Demolition docket The City's Preservation Review Ordinance was amended in the late 1990s to exclude parts of North St. Louis city that many thought were not salvageable. This amendment came just as developers were discovering the Historic Preservation Tax Credits and beginning to understanding the tool's full potential. Areas where preservation review occurred and where historic districts existed saw unprecedented levels of investment over the course of the next two decades. With development plans that began to encompass several miles of the city not within a review district and with broad opposition to unnecessary and unwarranted demolition of the built environment, Reed created an additional layer of oversight of proposed demolitions with the ‘Demolition Docket.’ This docket, for the first time, made demolition permit activity available to the public and was published online to give residents real time access to addresses on the chopping block. The docket tracked hundreds of demolitions and drew attention to several historically significant properties that would have otherwise been silently demolished. In 2014 Reed partnered with the Preservation Research Office, who agreed to maintain the Demolition Docket and to provide the level of oversight needed. ; Gun Buybacks Reed believes that buybacks, when done thoughtfully and strategically, can \\"result in a significant decrease in suicides, assaults, and homicides and connect the population at large with the looming issue of gun violence.\\" On January 31, 2014, as a response to Missouri statute RS Mo. 571.067, which made buybacks illegal without municipal legislation enabling such programs and added stipulations as to how guns are disposed, Reed introduced and received unanimous support for Resolution 206, thereby making gun buybacks legal again in the City of St. Louis. In a press release issued the same day Reed provided the following quote: \\"The City of St. Louis is caught in a vicious cycle of poverty and violence that tears apart lives on an alarmingly frequent basis. Guns play an out-sized role. Yet there is an unfortunate disconnect between needs of city residents, in both St. Louis and Kansas City, on the one hand and priorities of out-state legislators in Jefferson City on the other. We must look out for the well-being of our children before the livelihoods of gun dealers.\\" ; #Plant4PeaceSTL St. Louis was more divided than ever following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Reed organized the largest regional tree planting effort in St. Louis history to bring neighbors together, to promote peace, understanding and unity. More than 500 trees were planted by some 300 organizations all across St. Louis City and County and in the parks of Ferguson. Filmmaker Corinne McAffee created a documentary short of the event that has received praise from audiences across the country titled #Plant4PeaceSTL ; Establishing a Poet Laureate for the St. Louis Region In late 2014 Reed passed board bill 142 creating a six (6) member Poet Laureate Task Force and launched www.STLPoet.org to solicit interest from the literary arts community in filling this post on behalf of the City of St. Louis. On December 12th, with unanimous support from the Board of Aldermen, Reed appointed Michael Castro as the inaugural Poet Laureate, an iconic poet unanimously recommended by the Task Force. ; Senior Services Fund (Proposition S) In November 2016, voters of the City of St. Louis favorably approved Proposition S, which allowed for the creation of a senior services fund supported by a newly established 5 cent property tax. Proposition S was sponsored by Reed at the Board of Aldermen and backed by a coalition of organizations serving the needs of seniors, and promoted through a campaign titled \\"Seniors Count\\". This effort aims to address serious gaps in funding and delivery of services for residents 60 years of age and older who wish to continue to live independently. The fund will make up for gaps in Medicare and Medicaid coverage, access to transportation, proper nutrition, routine home maintenance, quality homemaker/respite services, and adequate care coordination as well as opportunities for socialization, dental and behavioral healthcare.

The club opened in 1949. The Black Orchid was declared bankrupt in July 1959, closed, and never reopened. The club was located at Rush and Ontario Streets in Chicago's Near Northside. The club was frequented by celebrities that included Tony Bennett and Hugh Hefner.  Owners  The founding owner, Al Greenfield (né Albert Melvin Greenfield; 1908–1984) sold the club in 1956 to Paul David Raffles (1932–1973), Pat Fontecchio (aka Patsy, né Patrick Frank Fontecchio; 1914–1994), and William (Bill) Doherty. Greenfield sold it so that he could be near his ex-wife, Gertrude Niesen, whom he married July 19, 1943, and remarried in the 1950s — and remained married to her until her death in 1975. Raffles, Fontecchio, and Doherty also owned The Cloisters Inn at 900 Rush Street. Before founding The Black Orchid, Greenfield had been partners with Milton Schwartz in four cocktail lounges: The Rhumba Casino (opened 1941) at 222 North State Street, The Capital Lounge at 167 North State Street, The Hollywood Show Lounge at 87 West Randolph Street, and The Brass Rail at 62 West Randolph Street.Cocktail Lounges Closed; Charge Sale to Minors, Morning Star (Rockford, Illinois), July 29, 1942, pg. 14 Schwartz and a partner, Ralph Mitchell, of Ralph Mitchell & Associates, had been pioneers in the Chicago night club business from 1941, through the 1950s. Before co-owning The Black Orchid, Patsy Fontecchio had been a nightclub MC, originally in his hometown of Hurley, Wisconsin.Personal Items, Ironwood Daily Globe, April 1, 1936, pg. 6, col. 5 = Bankruptcy = The media reported that Raffles, Fontecchio, and Doherty were the owners when bankrupt proceedings began in 1959. An Associated Press article reported that three waiters — Gorge Ellis, Henry Mallick (1909–2003), and Mario Bastiani (né Salvadore Mario Bastiani; 1917–1988) — triggered the proceedings by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois to declare the club bankrupt. They contended that they were owed wages of $1,847. A month before the bankruptcy proceedings, Billboard published that Ruffles and his wife were giving up the night club business to live in Los Angeles. Federal and Illinois state court records reflect that Black Orchid, Inc., an Illinois corporation, Gertrude Niesen, Albert Greenfield, and others, were parties of a lawsuit involving tax liens, debtors claims on escrow accounts, and priority of Federal tax liens over state tax liens.James E.

Published by Riverhead Books in 2012, it is regarded by The New York Times as the first general- interest biography of Kircher, who has experienced a resurgence of academic attention in recent decades. The book traces Kircher's life from his birth in 1602 in Germany through his rise as a scholar at the Jesuit Collegio Romano to the decline of his reputation and his death in Rome in 1680. After Kircher arrived in Rome in 1633, a few months after the Galileo trial, he pursued myriad interests, authoring more than thirty books on such subjects as optics, magnetism, music, medicine, and mathematics, and developing a collection of natural specimens and curiosities into a well known Cabinet of Curiosities or early modern museum.John Glassie: A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change.

It was constructed by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and Reading Railroad in 1888–1889. The station closed in 1967 with the cessation of CNJ passenger service. The station was located one block east of the Lehigh Valley Railroad's Allentown station.Hellerich, Mahlon H, and Pennsylvania) Lehigh County Historical Society Allentown. Allentown, 1762-1987 : a 225-year history. Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987 History = Early railroads = During the first half of the 19th century, Allentown was primarily a small market town for farmers. It was not until 1851 that the first railroad reached Allentown with the chartering of the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad, which later became the Lehigh Valley Railroad. A small station was built in 1855 which linked the city with Easton and Mauch Chunk. However, the railroad was not a major factor in local transportation.Allentown Pennsylvania Bicentennial, Lehigh Country Sesquicentennial, Lehigh Country Historical Society, 1962. During the Civil War, the industrial growth along the Lehigh River saw the establishment of industry in the city. To be successful, the industries needed cheap and reliable transportation systems to haul the raw materials and the finished products. The Lehigh Canal, built in the 1820s was the major transport link used to haul anthracite coal from northeast Pennsylvania to the factories, but a major flood in 1862 seriously damaged the Canal. Charters were issued to two railroad companies, the Lehigh Valley and Lehigh and Susquehanna (later leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey) to build lines into Allentown. The Reading Lines entered the city soon afterwards. Along with the freight railroads, Allentown became a destination for immigrants who found work in one of Allentown's textile mills and factories. = Industrial era = It was in the late 1880s that both railroads built elaborate stations in Allentown, and all lines serving Allentown converged at the two stations.The Union Street Train Tower LV rail lines ran south into Allentown from Mauch Chunk, primarily along the west side of the Lehigh River. The lines crossed under the Tilghman Street Bridge past LV freight yard north of Walnut Street, then under Linden Street to the passenger station. The lines continued south out of Allentown, then turned east, following the west side of the river through Rittersville, Fountain Hill and South Bethlehem under the Hill to Hill Bridge, past Bethlehem Steel to Easton.Guidebook of the Lehigh Valley Railroad CNJ tracks ran along the east side of the Lehigh from Mauch Chunk, then crossed the river where American Parkway now ends and turns onto North Dauphin Street. The former CNJ crossover bridge remains standing derelict crossing the river. South of Allentown, CNJ turned east and again crossed the Lehigh River, following the west side through CNJ's Allentown yard, which is still operated by Norfolk Southern Railway. Both lines into Allentown were double-tracked, paralleling each other into their respective stations following American Parkway, which was later built on the abandoned railbed. A shared, separate double-tracked freight line ran to the east of the passenger stations.History of the Central Railroad of New Jersey During World War I, both stations were used by the United States Army Ambulance Service (USAAS) that operated Camp Crane, a training camp for Army Ambulance drivers and support personnel. Thousands of soldiers arrived in Allentown at the stations, then were transported to the training camp. After graduating from training, the stations became pre-embarkation point, with thousands of men moving in and out rapidly, usually arriving and leaving on trains in the middle of the night. The Allentown stations provided passenger rail service for decades to Scranton, Reading, Harrisburg, New York City, Philadelphia and other points along the nation's inter-city rail network. Major named trains included the Queen of the Valley (CNJ/Reading, Jersey City-Harrisburg), Interstate Express (Reading/Lackawanna, Syracuse-Philadelphia), Scranton Flyer/Philadelphia Flyer (Reading, Philadelphia-Scranton).Official Guide of the Railways, August 1936, Central Railroad of New Jersey section, Table 1 =Decline= The former Central RR of New Jersey station in Allentown, Pennsylvania, as it appeared in 2018 LV had its peak of passengers during the 1940s, however during the 1950s, as the Interstate Highway network grew and long-distance bus and airline service expanded, passenger patronage declined. LV petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to cut back its unprofitable passenger service. LV ended service to Allentown on February 4, 1961. All Aboard to Allentown – The Lehigh Valley’s Abandoned Railroad Stations The Allentown Terminal Station was operated jointly by CNJ and the Reading Railroad (RDG). Both CNJ and RDG leased each other's lines in Pennsylvania, and suffered the same fate in terms of reduced passenger ridership. RDG Allentown-Harrisburg passenger service ended in June 1963, terminating its Allentown service at the CNJ station by 1965. It continued operations to Jersey City, New Jersey for two more years before ending all passenger service from Allentown in 1967. After the end of passenger rail service to Allentown, both LV and CNJ stations were closed and abandoned. Both stations became derelict and LV station was demolished in 1972 with the widening of the Hamilton Street Bridge over Jordan Creek. Today only some rusting steel beams extending over the Creek remain. CNJ rail lines were dismantled and Hamilton Street was resurfaced over where the lines had run. The CNJ station remained derelict until 1980, when the property was restored as a restaurant. The renovated property went through several owners (Depot Restaurant, Gingerbread Man, B&G; Station, Jillian's Billiard Cafe) over the next two decades, lastly being called Banana Joe's which opened on Labor Day 2001. The property abruptly closed in September 2007 after a shooting which caused a dramatic drop-off in patrons. It has remained closed and vacant since then; the building slowly deteriorating.

The special features a giant mechanic dog robot menacing the Scooby gang. Plot Fred has entered the Science Expo in Houston, Texas with a monster trapping project involving magnets, a trampoline, and a sticky net. A girl accidentally gets caught in the trap but is quickly freed by Fred. She catches Fred's eye and identifies herself as Melanie Staples, daughter of NASA Scientist Ned Staples. The gang checks out her father's demonstration where he unveils a large robotic dog, \\"Mecha Mutt\\", equipped to travel over Mars terrain. Suddenly, Mecha Mutt goes rogue and starts firing lasers out at the audience. Security goes after the robot leaving a perplexed Dr. Staples to face anxious reporters who blame the malfunction on the \\"Space Specter\\". Melanie explains to the gang that the Space Specter is an old legend about a ship that lost control while piloting through some space mist. A spirit attached itself to the ship when it landed on Earth and now anytime something goes wrong at NASA, they blame the supposed specter. The group splits up to talk to the other two people who worked on Mecha Mutt besides Melanie's father. Fred, Daphne, and Melanie talk to Lab Assistant Irv, who has a desk covered in food wrappers and sticky hands. Irv claims to have no idea why the machine went crazy having done a diagnostic test on it just before the demonstration. He laments being too busy to date before the trio take leave. Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby encounter a large mechanical dog on their way to Dr. Devon Albright's office. They find out Dr. Albright was the original creator of the Mecha Mutt technology and she's bitter that the more famous Dr. Staples was put onto her project to raise more funds. Shaggy and Scooby go off and find vacuum sealed space food in a different room ‒ as well as Mecha Mutt. They are chased into a large wind tunnel room and get trapped inside before the industrial fan blows them all up. Velma, Fred, and Daphne find them and turn off the fan but not before Mecha Mutt escapes. Melanie soon joins them and Velma discovers the controls to the wind tunnel are sticky. When they confront Irv, he denies leaving the room and security footage backs up his claim. Velma and the others ask Dr Albright to lend them her prototype dog rover to find Mecha Mutt and Scooby and Shaggy get roped into piloting the dog rover. On the rooftop, Shaggy and Scooby find Mecha Mutt. After a fight with missiles and rocket boosters, the two machines crash into a magnet-wielding crane and Mecha Mutt is destroyed. Velma identifies Melanie as the culprit behind Mecha Mutt's rampage. Melanie admits that she did it because her famous father always neglected her and she wanted to step out of his shadow to prove she was just as brilliant as him. In the end, Fred wins second place in the Science Expo and Shaggy and Scooby end up finding more than just astronaut food when they end up accidentally launched into outer space.

In contrast to private serfs, state serfs were considered personally free, although attached to the land. They were liberated in 1866.  History  The state peasants were created by decrees of Peter I and applied to population who were involved in land cultivation and agriculture: various peasant classes, single homesteaders (servant people on the border area adjoining the wild steppe), the non-Russian peoples of the Volga, and the Ural regions. The number of state peasants increased due to several factors: the confiscation of church lands (huge estates of the Russian Orthodox Church) by Catherine II, additional conquered territories (the Baltic States, the Right-Bank Ukraine, Belarus, Crimea, the Caucasus), and the former serfs of the confiscated estates of the gentry of the Commonwealth, among others. Many of these state peasants replenished runaway private serfs and allowed peasants to re-settle on the developed but un-tended lands (Bashkiria, New Russia, North Caucasus, etc.). This process (transition of land previously tended runaway serfs to the category of state-serf tended land) implicitly encouraged the imperial power.Lyubavsky MK Review the history of Russian colonization. M., 1996. In the second half of the 18th century, the government handed out to the nobility hundreds of thousands of state peasants, practiced mass sale of state-owned estates, transferring them into specific state departments, and converted many state peasants to the position of military settlers in the western provinces (a deposit for rent landlords). Additionally from the nobility came suggestions to eliminate the estate of state peasants, requesting the passage of the state-owned land to private hands. Nevertheless, the relative number of state peasants grew. At the time of the first census in 1724 the state peasants accounted for 19% of the population, and by the last census in 1858 they accounted for 45% of the population in the same territory [2].  Position  State peasants lived on public land and paid taxes to the treasury. According to the first audit of the tax paying population of Russia (1719), there were in European Russia and Siberia 1,049,000 males (i.e. 19% of the total agricultural population), according to the 10th audit revision (1858) – 9,345 million (45.2% agricultural population). Presumably, the models for determining the position of legal state peasants in the Russian state were the crown peasants in Sweden. By law, the state peasants were seen as \\"free rural inhabitants.\\" State peasants, unlike the peasants of landowners, were seen as persons with legal rights; they could appear in court, trade, and own property. State peasants were also allowed to conduct retail and wholesale trade and open factories. The land on which the state serfs worked was considered to be owned by the state, but the peasants recognized the right of use – in practice, farmers committed transactions as the owners of the land.1 2 Bagger Hans \\"The reforms of Peter the Great.\\" M., 1985 \\" In addition to the state owned land, in 1801 it was allowed that the farmers could buy and own the rights to private property and \\"uninhabited\\" land (that is, land without serfs ).B. Mironov, \\"The Social History of Russian imperial period (XVIII – beginning of XX century)\\" \\" State peasants had the right to use the allotment of 8 acres per capita in the land-poor provinces and 15 acres per capita in more open provinces. The actual holdings were reduced by the end of 1830 by up to 5 acres in 30 land-poor provinces and 3.1 acres in the 13 open provinces. In practice, the bulk of the state peasants were making money that was paid as dues to private landowners; in the Kingdom of Poland and the Baltic, state- owned estates were leased to private owners and the state peasants were serving in private serfdom; peasants initially paid grocery dues, followed by monetary dues later in history. In the 1st half of the 18th century, rents ranged from 7 rubles 50 kopecks, to 10 rubles. With the increase of specific serf duties and the number of serfs, the money-rent of the peasants became relatively less than other categories of farmers trespass. The state peasants were also required to pay money into local taxes, paid a poll tax and serve other duties (road construction, waterway improvements, etc.). For many collective obligations many peasants responded with mutual responsibility by an established code of conduct. Kiselyov reforms As a result of eventual land shortage and increasing servile duties at the beginning of the 19th century, a progressive depletion of the state peasants resulted. This began to occur more frequently after state peasant unrest (for example the Cholera Riots and Potato Riots of 1834 and 1840–41) due to the reduction of holdings, the severity of dues, and other influences. The question of changing the management of state peasants was cause for numerous state projects. In the 1830s the government began to reform the management of the state of the village. Through the years 1837–41 reform was implemented, developed by Pavel Kiselyov. He established the Ministry of State Property and its local authorities which were assigned \\"guardianship\\" over state peasants through the rural community. Corvée duties were eliminated, state peasantry in Lithuania, Belarus and the Ukraine was stopped, renting state peasants out was eliminated, and the system of dues was modernized. A staunch opponent of serfdom, Kiselev believed that freedom should be introduced gradually, \\"to destroy slavery by itself and without disruption of the state.\\" The state government and the peasants were to have the opportunity to decide their own affairs within the framework of the rural community. However, the peasants were still attached to the land. A radical reform of the state of the village was made possible only after the abolition of serfdom. Despite the gradual transformation, they still encountered resistance because landlords feared that the release of government serfs would give a dangerous example to their private possessory of peasants. Kiselev intended to regulate the allotments and obligations serfs and partly subordinate them to the Ministry of State Property, but this outraged landowners and was not implemented. However, in the preparation of the eventual peasant reform of 1861, the drafters of the legislation used the experience Kiselev reforms, especially in the organization of peasant self-determination and the legal status of the farmers. Emancipation On 24 November 1866, Russia adopted a law \\"On the Land Device State Peasants\\", allowing the rural society to maintain land in their possession with the rights of \\"ownership\\". Redemption from the government of the property holdings was regulated by the law of 12 June 1886. After the implementation of these reforms, plots of state peasants were reduced by 10% in the central provinces and 44% – in the northern. Payments were calculated for 49½ years, and in some cases had to be made before 1931, but were canceled on 1 January 1907 as part of the Stolypin agrarian reform under the influence of the revolution in 1905.

He died on 8 June 1969 in Dodoma city, Tanzania. Mnyampala wrote in Swahili, the lingua franca of East Africa, not Cigogo, the native language of his ethnic group. Mnyampala wrote more than 25 books. Among them was Historia, mila, na desturi za Wagogo, a history of the Gogo people commissioned by the British colonial government. This book was translated into English by Gregory H. Maddox and published in 1995 as The Gogo: History, Customs, and Traditions. Mathias E. Mnyampala was working as a Tax Clerk for the Native Treasury in Dodoma during the colonial rule. He was intended to travel the whole Ugogo region in order to collect the tax and establish a census of the populations and their belongings. This is why he entered into contact with the Watemi, the gogo traditional Kings and Rainmakers, who allowed him to write this historical book by giving him the oral sources of his ten years long work. The author was pioneering in Kiswahili in the early 1940s the ethno-history trend and in the same time was a faithful messenger for special correspondences between the then Freedom Fighters Movement called Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and the Watemi. After the Independence of Tanganyika in 1961, Mathias E. Mnyampala continued his administrative career in the Judicial system as a Magistrate. His former pro-TANU sympathies and his literary talent allowed him to become the national chairman of the association of Kiswahili poets called Usanifu wa Kiswahili na Ushairi Tanzania (UKUTA). This association was in charge to promote the diffusion of Kiswahili, the official language of the new Tanzanian Nation, by teaching to the Tanzanian masses the classical forms of Kiswahili poetry and their conservative transformations.

He died in a wingsuit flying accident near Les Grandes Otanes in Switzerland. He had been travelling at around 125mph when he hit a ridge.  Life  Mark Sutton was the son of Air Marshal Sir John Matthias Dobson Sutton KCB, former Lieutenant- Governor of the Island of Jersey, and Lady Angela Sutton. He was educated at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst where he won the Sword of Honour. He received an officer's commission in the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles in December 1991, and served as an Army Officer until 1995. Upon leaving the Army, he changed career and moved into finance in the city of London. When he died, Sutton was working as a consultant for The Royal Bank of Scotland.  London 2012 Olympics  During a segment of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics entitled \\"Happy and Glorious\\", Sutton served as a stunt double of James Bond on a helicopter in a filmed portion of the segment. Alongside his friend Gary Connery (who was The Queen's double for the segment), Sutton skydived out of the helicopter into the Olympic Stadium. Following the ceremony, the sequence was described as one of its highlights by the media.  Death  In August 2013, Mark Sutton and 20 other top wingsuiters were invited to a three-day event in Chamonix, France known as Helibase 74, which was organised by Epic TV, a web TV channel specialising in extreme sports. In exchange for video footage of their flights, the website provided accommodations and helicopter access. On 14 August 2013, Sutton jumped alongside Tony Uragallo (both equipped with multiple video cameras) in a short \\"warm-up\\" flight near Les Grandes Otanes scheduled to last about a minute. However, tragedy struck only 20 seconds into the flight; as he jumped from the helicopter at , travelling at speeds of up to , Sutton veered off-course and crashed into a mountain ridge. A rescue helicopter arrived soon after Sutton hit the ground, but he was pronounced dead at the scene—Sutton's impact was so severe that a DNA test was required to identify his body, and a spokesperson stated that he had no chance of surviving the impact. While Sutton was equipped with a parachute during the flight for landing, it was left unused. As part of the investigation, the video footage from Uragallo's cameras were handed over to a Swiss police unit. An Epic TV spokesperson considered Sutton's death to be an accident, noting that two successful flights with other wingsuiters were held prior, and that they had planned to be \\"conservative\\" that day due to the large number of flights planned. The remaining participants in the event elected to continue on in honour of Sutton. His death was regarded as a major loss to the community of wingsuit flying, among whom he was considered to be one of the world's best. Among those to pay tribute to Sutton were Sebastian Coe, Gary Connery and Danny Boyle who said that his death was a \\"huge loss to his profession\\".

Operated by Vale Limited, construction on the plant started in April 2009 and operations began in 2014. Construction costs were in excess of CAD $4.25 billion. Construction involved over 3,200 workers generating approximately 3,000 person-years of employment. Operation of the plant will require approximately 475 workers. Production began in July 2014, reported in November 2014. Vale's nickel processing plant in Long Harbour received its first major shipment from its Labrador mine in Voisey's Bay in May 2015. As of that date, a small proportion of the plant's raw materials came from Voisey's Bay but the majority were imported from Indonesia. A spokesman for Vale said 100 per cent of the Long Harbour facility's production materials will come from Voisey's Bay by early 2016. Using the metal processing technology of hydrometallurgy, the plant is designed to produce per year of finished nickel product, together with associated cobalt and copper products. The hydrometallurgy technology was piloted at a demonstration plant that opened in Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador in 2004. This demonstration plant operated until 2008 and was instrumental in helping Vale decide to use the hydrometallurgy process for the Long Harbour processing plant. A processing plant on Newfoundland was one of the requirements established by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in order to exploit the nickel deposit at the Voisey's Bay Mine in Labrador. The bulk carrier MV Umiak I was one of several ice-strengthened bulk carriers built to transport nickel concentrate from Voisey's Bay to the Long Harbour Nickel Processing Plant. The Long Harbour Nickel Processing Plant was built on a partially brownfield site near the port of Long Harbour. The facility consists of a wharf for offloading nickel ore concentrate from bulk carriers, crushing and grinding facilities, a main processing plant approximately south of the port, a pipeline to supply process water, an effluent discharge pipe and diffuser, and a residue pipeline to a nearby disposal area. The hydrometallurgical process in the plant will pressure-leach the nickel ore concentrate in acidic solutions to separate iron, sulfur and other impurities from nickel, copper and cobalt. On June 11, 2018, Premier Dwight Ball announced Vale is moving forward with its underground mine at Voisey's Bay. Ball stated that the move will extend the mine's operating life by at least 15 years. First ore is expected by April 2021 with processing to take place in Long Harbour.

His son, Joseph Farcot, was also a noted inventor. Early years Marie-Joseph-Denis Farcot was born in 1798. His father was Joseph Jean Chrysostome Farcot, a former teacher at the college of Juilly, Seine-et-Marne. He was orphaned at a young age, and became an apprentice with Achille Colas and with Jecker, an expert maker of precision instruments. In 1820 he began work in the studio of Chaillot, where he learned steam engine construction. His training led him to create steam engines that were also precise instruments. Manufacturer and inventor In 1823 Farcot established a workshop on the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. In 1829 he received a bronze medal for two inventions, a variable-speed pump and a pump with two pistons in one body, giving a continuous jet. In 1834 he was awarded a silver medal for an olive oil press. In 1836 Marie-Joseph Farcot patented the first method of steam distribution that gave almost complete variability to the regulator. In 1839 he had transferred his workshop to the rue Moreau, and that year received another silver medal for an innovative steam engine with variable power. In 1846 he transferred his metallurgical factory to Saint- Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis, where he purchased land covering . The factory was accessible by railway branches from the north and the west. It mainly produced steam engines, but also made boilers, pumps and other products. The factory employed 145 workers in 1849, and 500 to 700 between 1872 and 1902. Marie- Joseph Farcot worked with his son, Jean Joseph Léon Farcot, who obtained many patents for mechanical engineering inventions, notably the servomechanism. Their company was called Farcot and Son. In 1854 Marie-Joseph Farcot was awarded patents for two ways to modify Watt's governor so as to eliminate offset. In 1857 Marie-Joseph Farcot proposed a number of improvements to steam hammer design, including an arrangement so the steam acted from above, increasing the striking force, improved valve arrangements and the use of springs and material to absorb the shock and prevent breakage. He and his son Jean Joseph obtained another governor patent in 1862, and in 1864 a patent for a spring-loaded governor.

Reducing debt can also produce a de facto dividend; assuming the value of the firm remains the same, shareholder value is increased as debt is reduced. To understand how debt reduction increases shareholder value, it is helpful to consider the 1958 paper by Nobel laureates Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller entitled The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment.Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller (June 1958), “The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 3. This paper proved that a firm’s value is independent of how it is financed, provided that one ignores the tax effect of debt interest. If Modigliani and Miller are correct, the use of free cash flow to repay debt results in a transfer of wealth from the debtor to the shareholder. History of term The term shareholder yield was coined by William W. Priest of Epoch Investment Partners in a paper in 2005 entitled The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns as a way to look more holistically at how companies allocate and distribute cash rather than considering dividends in isolation.William W. Priest (December 2005), The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns, Epoch Investment Partners. This concept was further detailed in the 2007 book, Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor, by William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland.William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland (2007) Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor, Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons.

Early life Dubey was born in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, to Ganesh Dutt Dubey and Madhu Dubey. Her father worked for the government-owned telecom department, and this job resulted in frequent transfers to different parts of the country as she was growing up, from Jammu to Nagpur, Calcutta and Hyderabad. The family finally settled in Mumbai in 1971, after which she completed school at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Colaba, and graduated from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai in 1980. During this time she was also the winner of the Annual Essay Competition held by the Royal Commonwealth Society in 1973. Career Dubey married in 1984 and moved to Chennai. Subsequently her work was published under the name Scharada Bail until her divorce in 2008. During this time she authored children's stories for the children's edition of The Hindu, won successive awards from the Children's Book Trust, as also published a number of children's books. Some of the books written by her at this time were Malwa on my Mind, a travelogue set in Central India, A Necessary Journey, about a fictional adventure and The Hanuman Heart, a book with stories for children about the Hindu deity Hanuman, among others. In 2008, following her divorce, she reverted to her maiden name after being published for many years as Scharada Bail. She also relocated to Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, where she lived for three years alongside the temple town of Ayodhya. This was how she wrote the book Portraits from Ayodhya: Living India’s Contradictions. Following this, she spent another two years in Uttar Pradesh in the capital city of Lucknow, before relocating once more. She presently lives and works in Pune, Maharashtra. Dubey's children's books are described as introducing children to contemporary realities in an accessible and endearing manner. Her non-fiction work focuses on the lived experiences of ordinary people, and has been described as \\"humanising\\" the debate over the disputed site at Ayodhya through this method. Dubey's most recent work Bol Bam (2013) is an account of the various spiritual journeys (yatras) made by devotees of Lord Shiva every year. Written as a travelogue, this book explores the various sites of Shiva pilgrimage across India through the author's own eyes as well as those of the many pilgrims who make these journeys. This book has been well received and commended for its honest style and portrayal of the human side of faith in modern India.

History Castor Dentel was born in Tampa to Donald Castor, a former Hillsborough County Judge, and Betty Castor, who served as the President of the University of South Florida, Florida Education Commissioner, State Senator, and the 2004 Democratic nominee for the United States Senate. Her sister, Kathy Castor, is currently a United States Congresswoman from Florida's 14th congressional district. Her brother, Frank Castor, is currently a Judge in Palm Beach County, Florida. She graduated from Chamberlain High School and then attended Vanderbilt University, where she received a bachelor's degree in elementary education in 1990. Castor Dentel then attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, receiving her Master of Education in literacy studies in 1993. Finally, she attended the University of Florida, receiving her PhD in curriculum and instruction in 2001. Castor Dentel has taught elementary school for a total of fifteen years throughout Orange County Public Schools and with the School Board of Alachua County in Gainesville, FL. Castor Dentel was elected to the Orange County School Board for District 6 in August 2017 and served the remaining 2 years of School Board Member Nancy Robbinson's term. She is a candidate for re-election to the school board with the election on August 18, 2020. Her campaign website is Karen4SchoolBoard.com. Florida House of Representatives When the state legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, incumbent State Representative Scott Plakon opted to run for re-election in the newly created 30th District so as to avoid a contentious primary with fellow Republican Chris Dorworth, which required him to relocate his family, as he did not live in the 30th District. Castor Dentel opted to run against Plakon, winning the Democratic primary uncontested, and a contentious election ensued. Castor Dentel and Plakon took vastly different positions on a number of issues, including abortion, where Plakon supported legislation that would restrict access to abortion while Castor Dentel opposed any restrictions, and education, where Plakon supported the controversial parent-trigger legislation while Dentel \\"opposes private-school vouchers and the charter-school legislation.\\" Castor Dentel attacked her opponent as \\"an extreme social conservative\\" while emphasizing her support for public schools. The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Castor Dentel over Plakon, criticizing him for putting \\"too much of his energy into ideological crusades,\\" like his attempts to \\"put new limits on abortion and decertify labor unions.\\" They praised Castor Dentel for having a \\"smart platform for creating jobs and reviving Florida's economy that includes strengthening public education, promoting innovation through support for higher education and research, and upgrading Florida's infrastructure, including its ports.\\" In the last few days of the campaign, a political committee supporting Plakon sent out a mailer used a picture of Jerry Sandusky to attack Castor Dentel, claiming that she \\"would rather protect bad teachers and the union than young and impressionable students,\\" which was condemned by both campaigns. In the end, Castor Dentel was able to defeat Plakon by a surprisingly wide margin, winning 53% of the vote to Plakon's 47%. During her time in the legislature, Castor Dentel strongly opposed a number of education reforms, including the controversial parent-trigger legislation, which would allow the parents of students attending struggling public schools to petition to create a privately-run charter school. She argued that the bill condemns local school boards and proclaims \\"outside, for-profit companies as heroes,\\" noting, \\"It's about misleading the public.\\" Additionally, when Governor Rick Scott made the decision to withdraw the state from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for Colleges and Careers, she said that she \\"welcomed\\" that decision, but argued that, as Florida made the drawn out transition to the Common Core State Standards Initiative, \\"We don't have to test that year. We can pause.\\" While Castor Dentel served on the K-12 Education and the Education Appropriations subcommittees, she was also a member of the Economic Development and Tourism as well as the Business and Professional Regulation subcommittees. Since her term in the legislature, Castor Dentel has continued her public education advocacy throughout the state of Florida. She served as the Director of Community School Development for The Children's Home Society of Florida and as an Education Policy Advocate for Fund Education Now, Inc.

Design and development At different times and in different places the Tsikada or Sky Wind series has been marketed either under the company name, Gidroplan, or under its English translation, Hydroplane. The earliest Tsikada was shown in 2000 and was a high-wing monoplane, with twin engines mounted above and forward of the wing leading edge. This arrangement has been maintained through later versions. The original aircraft was a two seater with two doors, powered by Rotax 582 engines. It was followed in 2007 by the Tsikada-M or Sky Wind 1, which had more powerful Jabiru engines and modifications to the fuselage and cabin, the undercarriage and the control systems. A four-seat prototype, the Tsikada-3M, preceded a four-seat, four-door, four-window production version known as the Tskiada-4 or Sky Wind-AT, which is longer than before. The earlier flaperons were replaced with separate flaps and ailerons. The prototype finished flight trials in July 2009 and the Tsikada-4 was first flown in August, followed by production the following year. The Tsikada has a metal wing, rectangular in plan and with small downturned tips. The engines are mounted over the wing as close together as the propeller discs allow. They, and the wing centre section are supported over the fuselage by a short cabane; a single faired strut on each side braces the wing to the lower fuselage, assisted by a jury strut. The composite skinned fuselage has one or two rows of side by side seats, each with a pair of side windows in the doors, behind a single piece windscreen. There is a baggage compartment with a maximum load of . Aft of the cabin the fuselage tapers, with an upswept underside, to a tall swept fin and balanced rudder. The rectangular tailplane, externally braced from above and carrying separate, unbalanced elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement, is mounted on the fin a little above the fuselage. The tricycle undercarriage has mainwheels on sprung cantilever legs and a steerable oleo sprung nose wheel. A chemical hopper with underwing spray bar and discharge chute from the central fuselage underside is an option. Operational history Three Tsikada-Ms were supplied to Cuba, the first for anti-mosquito spraying, between 2008 and 2010. In all, six two-seat Tsikadas were built.

Administratively it is made up of two municipal territories: Baza and Huéscar. Topography The altiplano consists of a high plain (700 –1000 metres) surrounded by several high mountain ranges; Sierra Castril and Sierra del Pozo to the north, Sierra de Orce and Sierra Maria to the West, and Sierra de Baza in the south. The area includes the Hoya de Baza and the valleys of the Galera, Huescar and Guardal rivers. Approximately 8 million years ago the altiplano is thought to have formed a huge inlet that connected the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. As the mountain building activity associated with the Sierra Nevada has raised the area, so the level of the sea fell and temporarily formed an inland lake, eventually the area drained to the east, towards the Rio Guadalquivir. The geology of the altiplano is characterised by naturally cemented horizontally arranged oceanic sediments.Museo de Prehistoria y Paleontologia de Orce Climate Rainfall in the basin is slight, but precipitation falls on the surrounding mountains and spawns a number of Rivers References Category:Geography of the Province of Granada ","title":"Altiplano de Granada"},{"id":"40251438","text":"John de Rednesse (died after 1386) was an English born judge who served four times as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 1 p.78 He was the son of Stephen de Rednesse, whose family took their name from the village of Reedness in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He is first heard of in 1327 when he received a royal pardon for killing one of his servants. He is unlikely to have been more than twenty at the time, since he was still alive almost sixty years later. Between 1335 and 1342 he served as Commissioner for the Peace in Yorkshire.Ball p.78 Modern-day Reedness, John's birthplace He came to Ireland in 1344 as a justice of the King's Bench. In 1346 he was appointed Lord Chief Justice; he was later demoted to second justice of the King's Bench, and was then reappointed Chief Justice. In all he served four terms as Lord Chief Justice.Ball p.78 Such rapid changes of personnel on the medieval Irish bench were not uncommon, but they normally resulted from a clash between rivals for office; in Rednesse's case, unusually, he was replaced on each occasion by a different man. In his later years a rival did emerge in the person of Richard de Wirkeley, Prior of the Order of Hospitallers, who was appointed Chief Justice in 1356, but he was quickly replaced by Rednesse, and ordered by King Edward III not to intermeddle with the office.Calendar of Patent Rolls of Edward III 20 June 1356 Rednesse was finally removed from office in 1361. He returned to England, where he spent his later years in his native Yorkshire. He served on a Commissioner for the Peace in 1374.Ball p.78 In 1386, by which time he must have been far advanced in years, he was one of several local landowners who were asked to conduct an inquiry into the illegal digging of a watercourse in the Holderness region, which was causing a nuisance.Poulson, George History and Antiquities of the Seignory of Holderness London 1840 Vol. 1 p.133 References Category:People from Goole Category:Lords Chief Justice of Ireland Category:14th-century births Category:14th-century deaths ","title":"John de Rednesse"},{"id":"40251440","title":"Akie Kotabe"},{"id":"40251444","text":"Thapar family is a family of Indian business people and philanthropists.

They were first described by W. M. S. Russell and R. L. Burch in 1959.Russell, W.M.S. and Burch, R.L., (1959). The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, Methuen, London. The 3Rs are: #Replacement: methods which avoid or replace the use of animals in research #Reduction: use of methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals. #Refinement: use of methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals cannot be avoided. In many countries, these 3Rs are now explicit in legislation governing animal use. It is usual to capitalise the first letter of each of the three 'R' principles (i.e. 'Replacement' rather than 'replacement') to avoid ambiguity and clarify reference to the 3Rs principles. History In 1954, the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) decided to sponsor systematic research on the progress of humane techniques in the laboratory. In October of that year, William Russell, described as a brilliant young zoologist who happened to be also a psychologist and a classical scholar, and Rex Burch, a microbiologist, were appointed to inaugurate a systematic study of laboratory techniques in their ethical aspects. In 1956, they prepared a general report to the Federation's committees, and this report formed the nucleus of the book which was completed at the beginning of 1958. Over much of the period they worked with a special Consultative Committee, chaired by Professor P.B. Medawar. As a contribution to the centenary of The Origin of Species, the quotations at the head of each chapter are all from the works of Charles Darwin. Scope and development A common misconception of the 3Rs is that they refer only to replacement;Rowan, A.D., (1991). The alternatives concept. Animal Welfare Information Center Newsletter, 2(2): 1-2 however, their scope is much broader. Replacement: In the original book, the 3Rs were restricted, arbitrarily, to vertebrates. Russell and Burch discussed the possibility of suffering with reference to sentience. They used the term \\"replacement technique\\" for any scientific method using non-sentient material to replace methods which use conscious living vertebrates. This non-sentient material included higher plants, microorganisms, and the more degenerate metazoan endoparasites which, they argued, had nervous and sensory systems that were almost atrophied. They acknowledged that the arbitrary exclusion of invertebrates meant that in several contexts, these species could be considered as possible replacements for vertebrate subjects; they termed this \\"comparative substitution\\". Russell and Burch also considered levels of replacement. In \\"relative replacement\\", animals are still required, though during an experiment they are exposed, probably or certainly, to no distress at all. In \\"absolute replacement\\", animals are not required at all at any stage. Replacement strategies include: #Tissue culture #Perfused organs #Tissue slices #Cellular fractions #Subcellular fractions More recent interpretations of the replacement principle suggest the preferred use of non- animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims, i.e. invertebrates are not considered suitable replacements for vertebrates. However, others such as the National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) advocate the use of some invertebrates in replacement studies. Therefore, the term 'Replacement' can refer to the use of a less sentient species, as in \\"relative replacement\\". Reduction: Reduction refers to methods which minimise the number of animals used per study. Russell and Burch suggested a reduction in the number of animals used could be achieved in several ways. One general way in which great reduction may occur is by the right choice of strategies in the planning and performance of whole lines of research. A second method is by controlling variation amongst the animals used in studies, and a third method is careful design and analysis of studies. With the advent, development and availability of computers since the original 3Rs, large data-sets can be used in statistical analysis, thereby reducing the numbers of animals used. In some cases, by using previously published studies, the use of animals can be totally avoided by avoiding unnecessary replication. Modern imaging techniques in conjunction with new statistical analysis methods also allow reductions in the numbers of animals used, for example, by providing greater information per animal. Refinement: Russell and Burch wrote \\"Suppose, for a particular purpose, we cannot use replacing techniques. Suppose it is agreed that we shall be using every device of theory and practice to reduce to a minimum the number of animals we have to employ. It is at this point that refinement starts, and its object is simply to reduce to an absolute minimum the amount of distress imposed on those animals that are still used.\\" Amongst areas of experiments that can be refined are the procedure to be used, the appropriateness of the species (its suitability for the procedure and its responses to a laboratory environment in general). Refinements techniques may include: #Non-invasive techniques #Appropriate anaesthetic and analgesic regimes for pain relief #Training animals to voluntarily co-operate with procedures (e.g. blood sampling) so that they have greater control over the procedure reduce distress #Provision of species-appropriate housing and environmental enrichment which meet the animals' physical and behavioural needs (e.g. providing opportunities for nesting for rodents) The definition of Refinement has evolved from that provided by Russell and Burch. A newer definition is now commonly accepted, any approach which avoids or minimises the actual or potential pain, distress and other adverse effects experienced at any time during the life of the animals involved, and which enhances their wellbeing. Refinement encompasses not only the direct harms associated with animal use, but the indirect, or contingent harms associated with breeding, transportation, housing and husbandry. Criticism Some have criticized the Three Rs for what they call \\"ambiguities\\" and tensions in the understanding and implementation of different prongs of the approach –Refinement, Reduction and Replacement. This is, in part, because different stakeholders (e.g. animal experimenters, institutional figures, policy makers, activists and the public) may interpret the Three Rs differently. The 3Rs principles do not address some issues, such as the ethics of using animals in research and focus instead on improving the humane use of animals which are used. Others have noted that promotion of the 3Rs has failed to reduce the number of animals used in experiments. However, this may be the result of a misunderstanding of the definition of 'Reduction', not an absolute reduction in the number of animals used, but a reduction in the number of animals used per study. By its nature, it is difficult to estimate the number of animals not used in scientific procedures as a result of Replacement or Reduction techniques however, despite the rapid increases in medical research, animal numbers have not increased at the same rate. In a review of dozens of articles involving mice in prolonged pain experiments, researchers found \\"there were no references to the \\"3Rs\\"\\" which in turn \\"raise serious questions about whether the 3Rs' principles of Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement are being appropriately implemented by researchers and institutions\\". The researchers continued, \\"That the 3Rs or any of the 3Rs' components—Replace, Reduce, or Refine—were not mentioned in any of the... studies suggests that prolonged mouse pain researchers may be unaware of or indifferent to the 3Rs framework and that this aspect is not considered relevant in the peer review process of manuscripts for scientific journals... [T]he growing proportion of the number of studies...in this paper suggests that adherence to guidelines and/or animal use committee requirements is not translating into significant progress from a reduction or replacement perspective\\". Following a review of the quality of experimental design in published journal articles, including the use of the 3Rs, it was found that the use and reporting of these principles was sporadic. As a result, the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines were developed and published in 2010. The ARRIVE guidelines present a 20-point list of items which must be reported in publications which have used animals in scientific research, including sample size calculations, explicit descriptions of the environmental enrichment employed and welfare-related assessments made during the study. Many journals now require authors to comply with the ARRIVE guidelines in the preparation of manuscripts. A follow-up review published in 2014 found that there were still low reporting levels of some elements, such as reporting of appropriate statistical methods and the avoidance of bias. In a survey of scientists in Portugal who had recently undergone training in the Three Rs, researchers found that a \\"surprisingly large number of researchers were unaware of the 3Rs principle, even those who had worked with animal models for over 10 years\\" and that subsequent training in the Three Rs \\"did not change perceptions on the current and future needs for animal use in research\\", but did increase knowledge of the application of the 3Rs The authors found that the training they provided \\"appear to have little influence on researchers' acceptance of replacement alternatives to animal use\\". Organisations The Home Office (UK) led the Inter-Departmental Group on Reduction, Refinement and Replacement, which aims to improve the application of the 3Rs and promote research into alternatives, reducing the need for toxicity testing through better sharing of data, and encouraging the validation and acceptance of alternatives. The Data Sharing Group drafted the Inter-Departmental Data Sharing Condordat published in August 2000 and was re- formed in June 2002 to consider the scope for the greater application of the 3Rs. Arising from the Government response to the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on animals in scientific procedures, the Group was asked to explore the scope for a UK centre for research into the 3Rs. The Group reported to Ministers that there was support for a body which would act as a means to better publicise and coordinate what is already done by way of research into the 3Rs. In May 2004, the NC3Rs was announced in the UK to act as a focal point for research into the 3Rs. Although the principles of the 3Rs were implicit in UK law under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986), the Directive 2010/63/EU governing animal use within the European Union http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0063&from;=EN Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes makes the principles explicit and researchers must demonstrate the use of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement techniques in research involving animals.

He served as president of Idaho State College (now Idaho State University) from 1947 to 1959. He was acting executive dean when the college achieved its independence from the University of Idaho in March 1947, and he elevated it into a four-year, bachelor's degree-granting institution in December 1948. He left Idaho in 1959 to become president of Long Beach State College (now known as California State University, Long Beach). He oversaw the college's rapid growth from less than 10,000 students to 28,000 and two name changes (to California State College at Long Beach in 1964 and to California State College, Long Beach in 1968). He was named president of Montana State University in 1970. He established the university's nursing and pre-medical education programs and completed its first football stadium and creative arts complex, but also faced a years of fiscal austerity imposed by the state legislature. He retired in 1977. Life and career =Early life and education= Carl McIntosh was born on December 1, 1914, in Redlands, California, to Carl Weston and Cora Lulu (Williams) McIntosh. His father was born in Bay City, Michigan, on September 20, 1883. He moved to California in 1887 and became a real estate salesman. His mother, Cora Lulu Williams, was born in Morristown, Tennessee, on November 8, 1882. Her family moved to California in 1899.Beal and Wells, p. 208. McIntosh attended public schools in Redlands, and graduated from Redlands High School in 1932.\\"Carl Weston McIntosh Retained By One Vote.\\" Redlands Daily Facts. March 26, 1976. He loved collecting insects, and drew extensive pictures of them.\\"Carl McIntosh Dies at 94.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 22, 2009. Accessed 2013-08-14. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Redlands in 1936. He participated on the speech and debate team at the college, and won several national competitions.Butler, Kevin. \\"Carl McIntosh, 94, Was Former Cal State Long Beach President.\\" Long Beach Press-Telegram. May 19, 2013. Accessed 2013-08-14. He considered majoring in entomology, but decided speech and debate were more fun. He then entered the University of Iowa, where he received his master of arts degree in 1937 and his Ph.D. in 1939. Both professional degrees were in speech communication. He studied music and voice at the Trinity College of Music in London, United Kingdom, for a short period of time in 1945, then entered the University of Redlands where he received his doctor of laws degree in 1952. While engaged in his studies, McIntosh obtained an appointment as an instructor in forensics (public speaking) at Park College in Parkville, Missouri. He served as a time as acting head of his department. In 1939, McIntosh accepted a position as an instructor of forensics at what was then known as the Southern Branch of the University of Idaho. He was attracted to the college because it was in the mountains and McIntosh could indulge his love of fishing.Vega, Frances. \\"Former CSULB President Dies at Age 94.\\" Daily 49er. January 26, 2009. Accessed 2013-08-13. He was promoted to assistant professor of speech in 1940. In 1943, McIntosh enlisted in the United States Army. He served in several capacities with the War Manpower Conservation Division and the Information and Education Division in the United Kingdom. He was the assigned to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), during which he saw service in Belgium, France, and Germany. His wife was pregnant with their daughter, and moved in 1943 to be with her family in Missouri. She gave birth to Diana in 1944.\\"Dr. Carl W. McIntosh (1914-2009).\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. January 25, 2009. McIntosh received an honorable discharge in 1946, and when he returned to the United States he saw his 18-month-old daughter for the first time. =Idaho State College and Long Beach State College= McIntosh returned to Idaho and resumed teaching. He was promoted to associate professor of speech, and served as director of the Summer Session and as Acting Executive Dean in 1947. In March 1947, the Southern Branch was made independent and renamed Idaho Southern College. The departing Executive Dean, John R. Nichols, was so impressed with McIntosh's public speaking skills that he successfully persuaded the board of regents to appoint McIntosh the first president of the new college. At 32 years of age, he was one of the youngest college presidents in the United States. Although McIntosh was not originally interested in being an administrator, once the school became an independent college he decided he wanted to remain president and see it through its early growing pains. McIntosh left Idaho in 1959 to become president of Long Beach State College. The college, founded in 1949, had received a permanent campus in 1950 and had grown rapidly in enrollment under its first president, Peter Victor Peterson.California Department of Education, p. 153. While McIntosh was president, Long Beach grew tremendously. Enrollment surged from about 10,000 to more than 30,000, and he rapidly expanded and revamped the curriculum. McIntosh tripled the number of faculty and constructed 30 new buildings. Although the 1960s were a period of deep unrest on American college campuses, McIntosh's collegial governing style, gentle and quite demeanor, and willingness to permit protest on campus (so long as it remained quiet and peaceful) helped keep Long Beach State relatively quiet throughout the period. In 1967, the California state legislature revamped the state college system. Long Beach State changed its name in 1968 to California State College, Long Beach, as part of these changes and began to be much more closely integrated into the California State College system.Teacher Education Programs in the United States: A Guide, p. 36. McIntosh left Long Beach in 1969, and became president of Montana State University in 1970. =Montana State University= Bobcat Stadium, shown here in 2013, opened in 1973 and was originally known as Reno H. Sales Stadium. It received its current name in 1998. Dr. Carl W. McIntosh was named MSU's eighth president in June 1970.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 127. McIntosh brought a consultative and deliberate style of decision-making to the university.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 129. He faced a poor fiscal climate: The state was entering a decade-long depression brought about by a steep drop in commodity prices, the state's higher education system had grown too large and unwieldy, and Governor Thomas L. Judge had established a blue-ribbon committee to close several of the state's colleges.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 130-138. In 1974, women faculty at MSU sued, alleging gender discrimination.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Geoff Gamble - A Hard Act to Follow.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. August 29, 2009. They won their suit in 1976, leading to a $400,00 damages award, a back-pay award, and extensive promotions (which also increased salaries).Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 139. To accommodate these fiscal realities, McIntosh ordered several doctoral and master's degree programs terminated, and all advanced degree programs in the social sciences and liberal arts canceled.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 141-142. But McIntosh also scored a number of successes. In 1972, he persuaded the legislature to allow MSU to participate in the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) medical program, which allowed 20 MSU graduates a year to complete medical school at the University of Washington.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 142. The college of nursing (Sherrick Hall) was finished in 1973,Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 143. and after three long years of construction Reno H. Sales Stadium (now Bobcat Stadium and Martel Field) and the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center both opened. In 1974, the long-planned Creative Arts Complex (Cheever Hall, Haynes Hall, and Howard Hall) was also completed. Unfortunately, major increases in inflation led to significant design changes. Instead of a 1,200-seat concert hall with superb acoustics, a cramped and aurally dead 260-seat auditorium was built. Finally, in 1976, the university completed the new medical science building, Leon Johnson Hall.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 146. McIntosh's arrival at MSU coincided with a confidential report by state auditors which revealed that the university's accounting system was 80 years of out date. Although not a single incident of embezzlement or misuse of funds had occurred (a fact McIntosh found remarkable), the state legislature seized on the report to denounce MSU as \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"profligate\\" in its spending.Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 128. In 1976, the \\"hidden million\\" controversy ended McIntosh's tenure as president. In 1975, Montana's first Commissioner of Higher Education, Dr. Lawrence K. Pettit (a former MSU professor of political science) launched an investigation of several Montana colleges and universities. He was particularly interested in MSU, where McIntosh's laid-back governance style was widely considered to have hurt the university. In March 1976, Pettit announced he was confiscating $1 million in surplus student fees from MSU — money he argued the university was trying to hide from state auditors and the legislature. In fact, the monies were the result of excessively high enrollment in the 1974-1975 school year, and were intended to help see the university through the 1975-1976 school year (when the legislature would not meet, and thus could not provide the needed budgetary boost to handle the over-enrollment).The monies would have covered less than 25 percent of the over-enrollment of 700 students. Pettit all but accused MSU and McIntosh of fraud, and McIntosh refused to attack Pettit's statements as mischaracterizations and slander. The public outcry about the \\"hidden million\\" led the Board of Regents to consider whether to request McIntosh's resignation. On June 30, 1976, by 4-to-3 vote, the Montana state commission of higher education voted to retain him. But McIntosh was unable to recover from the scandal. His low-key leadership style, the constant fiscal battles with the legislature, and the continuing attacks by Pettit led the university's board of regents to request McIntosh's resignation on June 30, 1977, which he tendered. (Pettit resigned the following year, his combative attempt to turn the commissioner's office into a sort of chancellorship having failed.)Rydell, Robert; Safford, Jeffrey; and Mullen, p. 152-153. Retirement and death McIntosh continued to live in Bozeman after his retirement. He lived alone, assisted in his later years by friends, receiving his meals from Meals on Wheels, and receiving regular deliveries of books from the Bozeman Public Library. For many years after his retirement, his successor, William Tietz, got together with McIntosh every few minutes to discuss current events, Montana State University, the state of Montana, Bozeman, and other topics. The meetings continued until McIntosh's death.Boswell, Evelyn. \\"The Former Presidents' Club.\\" Mountains and Minds. Spring 2009. Accessed 2013-08-13. McIntosh was a popular public speaker, and gave several commencement addresses in retirement. He fished often, wrote poetry, and was constant reader. By one count, he read more than 2,400 books between 1977 and his death in 2009. In 2008, McIntosh donated his extensive boyhood beetle collection to Montana State University. Carl W. McIntosh died on January 19, 2009, at his home in Bozeman, Montana. No cause of death was reported. He requested no funeral. Personal life On August 22, 1939, he married Mary Carroll Donnelly in Slater, Missouri. A daughter, Diana, was born in 1944. A second daughter, Catherine, was born in 1951 and died the same year. The McIntoshes later divorced. Mary Donnelly McIntosh died in 2005. Legacy and awards Idaho State University renamed its new, $1 million Red Hill student housing complex the Carl W.

The company is best known for its nautical spokesperson, the Ty-D-Bol Man, who piloted a boat inside the toilet tank in TV commercials from 1968 to 1984. History Introduced in 1957, Ty-D-Bol is a brand of in tank toilet bowl cleaner. Originally developed in 1958 by inventor and cleaning product pioneer, Harry O’Hare, Ty-D-Bol in its original form is a blue liquid cleanser/disinfectant for the toilet bowl.

Business activity  = VIANEX = The involvement of the Giannakopoulos family in the field of pharmaceuticals started in 1924, in the pharmacy on Peiraios Street. The decisive step was made by Paul Giannakopoulos in 1960, with the establishment of the company FARMAGIAN, which in 1971 became an SA and was renamed into VIANEX SA. The manufacturing activity of the company started in 1977 with the creation of the first factory. By 1999, VIANEX had acquired four modern factories in Athens and Achaia while at Varympompi it had established its main offices and distribution centre of finished products. In 1995, the subsidiary VIAN SA was established, to distribute and market well- known over-the-counter products (OTCs), food supplements, as well as diagnostic and parapharmaceutical products.

History  The term pogonophobia is derived from the Greek words pogon (πώγων) for beard and phobos (φόβος) for fear. Its antonym would be \\"pogonophilia\\", that is the love of beards or bearded persons. David Smith's 1851 publication of The Covenanter of the Reformed Presbyterian Church describes the Jesuits of Baden as suffering \\"a veritable pogonophobia at the sight of a democratic chin.\\" The term is generally meant to be taken in a jocular vein. In the 1920s, psychologist John B. Watson was able to condition this fear in a young boy by means of classical conditioning methods. In August 2013, Christopher Oldstone-Moore, history lecturer at Wright State University in Ohio, and author of The Beard Movement in Victorian Britain commented, \\"Facial hair for the past century has been thought to reflect a suspicious streak of individuality and defiance... Politicians, public servants and businessmen – and apparently journalists – risk their reputations if they abandon the razor.\\" Some relationship to \\"beardism\\" discrimination based on facial hair is claimed, and a difference in cultures is noted. Some association with claims of unhygienic beards (e.g., among homeless men) and fashion preferences of women. That various religious groups treat beards more or less reverently is also a factor, for example in Judaism and in Islam. Similarly, some groups require beards and forbid shaving, which has an effect on that society's norms and perceptions.  Accusations at the BBC  In August 2013, Jeremy Paxman accused his employers of pogonophobia after he was criticized by many newspapers and social networking sites for presenting the BBC's current-affairs programme Newsnight whilst sporting a beard. Paxman said: \\"Unless you're lucky enough to be Uncle Albert on Only Fools and Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza, the BBC is generally as pogonophobic as the late-lamented Albanian dictator, Enver Hoxha.\\" He later wrote: \\"The thing is, I don’t normally like beards,\\" and noting how he'd become a \\"poster-boy\\" for the Beard Liberation Front, Paxman lamented that he was \\"finding it quite a heavy burden\\". Former BBC Radio 4 and World Service broadcaster Robin Lustig, previously winner of \\"Beard of the Year\\", also described the BBC as pogonophobic. Danny Baker of BBC Radio 5 Live disagreed and stated that: \\"I really do not think Jeremy Paxman should be granted a beard. It's corrupt. Disney had it right. Hey BBC – no news beards.\\" Baker's remark about Disney is a reference to that company's long-standing ban on employees wearing beards, only lifted in 2012 nearly sixty years after its introduction.

She finished second in her only race as a two-year-old and won a minor race in the spring of 1987 before winning the Oaks. She followed up with an easy win in the Irish Oaks but was retired from racing after running poorly in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. She had some success as a broodmare. Background Unite was a \\"rangy, rather angular\\" chestnut mare with white socks on her hind feet bred by Edmund Loder at the family's Eyresfield Stud near the Curragh in County Kildare. She was the second of two classic winners, following the Triple Crown winner Oh So Sharp, sired by Kris the leading British miler of 1979. Unite's dam Pro Patria was a granddaughter of My Game, whose other descendants included Marling, Marwell and the Ascot Gold Cup winner Paean. As a yearling, Unite was sent to the Highflyer Yearling Sale at Newmarket and bought for 310,000 guineas by Sheikh Mohammed. The filly was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, and was ridden to her biggest successes by Walter Swinburn. Racing career As a two-year-old in 1986, Unite bypassed maiden races and made her debut in the Blue Seal Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse in September. She started odds-on favourite, but after taking the lead at half way she showed inexperience (\\"running green\\") and finished second, three lengths behind the winner White Mischief. Unite made her three-year-old debut at Newmarket Racecourse in April when she contested a one-mile Graduation Stakes (a race for horses which had won no more than one race). She won the race by one and a half lengths from the Henry Cecil-trained In The Habit. Unite was then moved up sharply to contest the 208th running of the Oaks Stakes (named for sponsorship reasons the Gold Seal Oaks) over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 6 June. Stoute had originally intended to run the filly in the Irish 1,000 Guineas, but after her win at Newmarket he decided that she needed further than a mile to show her full potential. Unite started at odds of 11/1 against ten opponents, with Scimitarra, the winner of the Lupe Stakes being made the 5/2 favourite ahead of Three Tails on 3/1. The first two in the betting were both owned by Sheikh Mohammed and Unite carried her owner's third colours, with a distinguishing blue cap. Swinburn positioned the filly just behind the leaders before taking the lead from Scimitarra entering the final furlong. In the closing stages the filly drew clear of her opponents to win by five lengths from Bourbon Girl, who was in turn three lengths ahead of Three Tails. Scimitarra broke down injured and was pulled up by her jockey Steve Cauthen. Five weeks after her Epsom win Unite started 8/13 favourite for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. She was never seriously challenged and won easily by three lengths from Bourbon Girl with the subsequent Irish St. Leger winner Eurobird four lengths further back in third. On 25 July Unite contested Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot and started at odds of 13/2 in a field which included Reference Point, Triptych, Moon Madness, Tony Bin and Acatenango. She appeared to be going well until the final turn, but then dropped back rapidly to finish eighth of the nine runners, more than twenty lengths behind the winner Reference Point. It was subsequently revealed than the filly had suffered a broken blood vessel during the race. Assessment In 1986, the Independent Timeform organisation gave Unite a rating of 83p, the \\"p\\" indicating that she was likely to improve. In the following year he was given a Timeform rating of 126, six pounds below the top-rated three-year-old filly Indian Skimmer. In the official International Classification she was rated the fourth-best European three-year-old filly (behind Miesque, Indian Skimmer and Milligram) and the best in the 11 furlongs plus division with a rating of 125. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Unite an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Stud record Unite was retired from racing after her defeat in the King George and became a broodmare for her owner's Darley Stud. Unite died in July 1995. She produced two winning daughters: *United Kingdom, bay filly 1989, sired by Danzig, won one race *La Confederation, bay filly 1991, sired by Nureyev, won three races including the Sun Chariot Stakes.

Shannahoff-Khalsa is a researcher in mind-body dynamics. He has published widely in scientific journals and regularly presents full day courses at the American Psychiatric Association and other national and international conferences. Shannahoff-Khalsa has also published three books outlining his years of experience using Kundalini Yoga meditation as taught by Yogi Bhajan to understand and treat psychiatric disorders. Current Professional Positions From 2011 to the present, David Shannahoff-Khalsa has been a member of the University of California, San Diego, Center for Integrative Medicine. From 2008 to the present, he has served as a consultant and yoga therapist at the Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, Executive Mental Health Program, Center for Wellness and Personal Growth. From July 2009 to the present, Shannahoff- Khalsa has been Director of The Research Group for Body-Mind Dynamics, BioCircuits Institute, University of California, San Diego, previous to which (1994-June 2009) he served as Director of The Research Group for Body-Mind Dynamics, Institute for Nonlinear Science, University of California, San Diego. David Shannahoff-Khalsa has served as a Senior Editor of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine since 2009. Scientific Publications David Shannahoff-Khalsa first published scientific papers in the Journal of Organic Chemistry (1973), Cancer Research (1974), and Biochemistry (1978), when his scientific career started in 1970 at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla with his work in the field of nucleic acid chemistry and biochemistry on unique chemical substitutions in nucleosides, nucleotides, and polynucleotides as potential anti-viral and anti-cancer agents. He later changed fields and started work on concepts and techniques from yogic medicine in 1976 while at The Salk, demonstrating how the nasal cycle is tightly coupled to the ultradian rhythm of alternating cerebral hemispheric activity (Werntz DA, Bickford RG, Bloom FE, Shannahoff-Khalsa DS, Alternating Cerebral Hemispheric Activity and the Lateralization of Autonomic Nervous Function. Human Neurobiology, 1983, 2:39-43), and on the yogic technique called unilateral forced nostril breathing (UFNB) where they demonstrated via EEG the selective hemispheric stimulation by UFNB (Werntz DA, Bickford RG, Shannahoff-Khalsa DS, Selective Hemispheric Stimulation by Unilateral Forced Nostril Breathing, Human Neurobiology, (1987), 6:165-171). He later wrote reviews on these topics (Shannahoff-Khalsa DS, The Ultradian Rhythm of Alternating Cerebral Hemispheric Activity, International Journal of Neuroscience, 1993, 70:285-298, Shannahoff-Khalsa DS, Lateralized Rhythms of the Central and Autonomic Nervous Systems, International Journal of Psychophysiology, 1991, 11:225-251, and again in \\"Selective Unilateral Autonomic Activation: Implications for Psychiatry\\" (a review article), CNS Spectrums: The International Journal of Neuropsychiatric Medicine, 12(8), pp. 625–634, Aug 2007, and most recently in Shannahoff-Khalsa in Psychophysiological States: The Ultradian Dynamics of Mind-Body Interactions, In the series “International Review of Neurobiology,” Academic Press (Elsevier Scientific Publications), vol 80, pps. 1-249, 2008 His scientific publications include a total of 56 articles as of 2013. Some of Shannahoff-Khalsa's most- cited work is a 1999 randomized control study on the effects of two meditation protocols on two groups of individuals with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The one group practiced The Relaxation Response plus Mindfulness Meditation technique, while the other group employed a Kundalini Yoga protocol specific for treating OCD. After three months, it was found the Kundalini Yoga group showed greater improvement on all six scales, namely the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Y-BOCS, Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised Obsessive Compulsive (SC-90-R OC) and Global Severity Index (SC-90-R GSI), Profile of Moods Scale (POMS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Purpose in Life test (PiL). Within group statistics (Student's paired t-tests) showed that the Kundalini Yoga group significantly improved on all six scales, while The Relaxation Response/Mindfulness Meditation group had no significant improvements on any scale. The groups were merged for an additional 12months using the Kundalini Yoga protocol, and final group improved significantly on all the scales, demonstrating that kundalini yoga techniques are effective in the treatment of OCD.Shannahoff-Khalsa, DS, Ray, LE, Levin, S, Gallen, CC, Schwartz, BJ, Sidorowich, JJ, Randomized control trial of yogic meditation techniques for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, CNS Spectrums [1999 4(12): 34-47] In 1993 he started work using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the brain effects of the yogic breathing technique specific for treating OCD using instrumentation at The Scripps Research Institute. That work continues today with collaborators at the University of Catania, Sicily. He continues to study the ultradian rhythm of alternating cerebral hemispheric activity using whole-head 306 MEG + 66 channel EEG and its coupling to the sleep stages of REM and NREM sleep with collaborators at UCSD and Harvard MGH.

Educated at Bruton grammar school, he went in 1820 to Wadham College, Oxford, where his uncle, Dr. Richard Michell (1766-1826), was a Fellow. Obtaining a first-class in literae humaniores (B.A. 1824, M.A. 1827, B.D. 1836, and D.D. 1868), Michell became a successful private tutor. At the age of 24 Michell was appointed examiner in the school of literae humaniores, and was elected in 1830 Fellow of Lincoln College, where he acted as bursar in 1832, and as tutor from 1834 to 1848. In 1839 he was elected in convocation the first prælector of logic, a post he held for ten years. In 1849 he delivered the Bampton lectures, on The Nature and Comparative Value of the Christian Evidences. In 1849 also, Michell was appointed public orator of the university, and he retained that office till his death. In 1856 Michell became rector of South Moreton, Berkshire, but did not reside there. On the formation of the new hebdomadal council under the act for reforming the university in 1854, Michell was elected to a seat, and retained it by till 1872. In 1848 he became vice-principal of Magdalen Hall, now Hertford College, of which John David Macbride was then Principal; he succeeded William Jacobson. In 1868 Michell succeeded Macbride in the principalship, and he then began to agitate for the conversion of the small hall into a college. The plan took shape in 1873, and was approved by convocation. T. C. Baring endowed the college with a large number of fellowships and scholarships, mostly limited to members of the church of England. The new foundation took the name Hertford College, used by the former foundation on the site. Michell became the first Principal of the new foundation of the college in 1874, and died 29 March 1877. Works Michell's Oxford orations delivered at the annual act or encaenia, alternately with the professor of poetry, were published in 1878 by his eldest son, Edward Blair Michell, with notes. They form a sort of running commentary on the history of the university for nearly 30 years.

Education Johnson attended Loyola University New Orleans, from which he earned a Bachelor of Arts in politics in 1997 and a Juris Doctorate in 2000 from the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. Political career Johnson has previously worked as a prosecutor. In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007, to fill the seat vacated by Democrat Charles Riddle, III, Johnson led by forty-seven votes his Republican opponent, Kirby \\"Coach\\" Roy, III (born 1954), a native of Alexandria who relocated to Hessmer in Avoyelles Parish. The presence of two other Democratic candidates compelled a second round of balloting, called the Louisiana general election. In that balloting, Johnson defeated Roy, 7,436 (52.8 percent) to 6,642 (47.2 percent). Roy challenged Johnson for a second time in the primary election held on October 22, 2011, but he fell far short of victory. Johnson received 8,037 votes (62.8 percent) to Roy's 4,768 (37.2 percent). Johnson serves on the Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture, and Rural Development Committee, the Insurance Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, the Joint Legislative Committee on Capital Outlay, and the Atchafalaya Basin Program Oversight Committee. He is a member of the Louisiana Rural Caucus. Johnson was an unsuccessful candidate in Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election held on October 19, 2013. Among fourteen candidates, he finished fifth with 9,971 votes (10 percent). He won a majority in his own Avoyelles Parish and finished with a plurality as well in East Feliciana, one of the Florida Parishes. Johnson finished just behind Clyde C. Holloway, the fourth- place candidate and a Republican member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission from Johnson's neighboring Rapides Parish. Holloway polled 11,250 votes (11 percent). The two top vote getters, both Republicans from northeastern Louisiana, State Senator Neil Riser of Columbia in Caldwell Parish and political newcomer, Vance McAllister, a businessman from the Monroe area, meet in the November 16 runoff election to choose a new representative to succeed Republican Rodney Alexander, who resigned in September to join the administration of Governor Bobby Jindal. While Riser has the support of three sitting U.S. representatives from Louisiana, McAllister shot to a runoff berth with the celebrity endorsement of Phil Robertson of the A&E; Network's Duck Dynasty television series. Johnson was considered a potential Democratic candidate in 2016 for the United States Senate seat vacated by Republican David Vitter but never filed for the position. Johnson ran for the State Senate's 28th district in 2019, but was defeated by Republican Heather Cloud.

As hair has a high commercial value – in the mid-19th century it was regarded as worth twice its weight in silver – opportunist thieves have targeted long-haired women, and less commonly men and children, with the aim of stealing their hair. Hair thieves have typically sought either to surreptitiously cut off hair in public places, or have mugged people and shorn their heads. The crime of hair theft has been widely reported in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia over the course of at least 300 years. Hair as a commodity After a thousand-year abeyance, wigs came back into fashion in western Europe from the 16th century onwards, boosted in particular by King Louis XIV of France in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Hair came to be seen in Western countries as a means of publicly displaying the wearer's high status and ability to engage in conspicuous consumption. A burgeoning trade in hair products included all the tools needed to maintain elaborate hairstyles – curling sticks, crimping irons, creams, soaps, oils, brushes, pins and so on. The increasing ornateness of formal hairstyles required many to supplement their natural hair with extensions, or to use wigs instead, created by commercial wig-makers. This created a highly profitable market in human hair, which was said in the mid-19th century to be worth twice its weight in silver. In 1851 of hair was imported from France to England with a value of £3,621 (£ today). The Hairdressers' Journal reported in May 1863 that a hundred tons of hair a year was being sold in Parisian markets. Not all hair was created equal; female hair from northern Italy and Spain was especially prized for its glossy blackness and curliness. It retailed at a price of 10–12 shillings per ounce (worth about £43/€50/$67 in 2013 prices), rising to £1 per ounce (about £87/€101/$136) for very long hair. A \\"hair harvest\\" was held annually in the poorer villages of Italy, where local girls sold their hair to wig-makers. One observer of a hair harvesting event reported seeing \\"several girls, sheared, one after the other like sheep, and as many more standing ready for the shears, with their caps in their hands, and their long hair combed out, and hanging down to their waists.\\" Hair crime Female hair is in high demand by wig-makers; a full-length wig made from human hair can be worth hundreds of dollars The value of human hair has meant that for several centuries criminals have seen hair as worth stealing. As a result, women in a number of countries have found themselves at risk of being mugged and their hair shorn off by hair thieves. As The Hairdressers' Journal put it in 1863, \\"Even in the present day it has happened over and over again that a good crop of hair has been laid in wait for, and shorn from the trembling victim, who has been only too glad to get free with but the loss of her hair.\\" An American newspaper reported in 1869 that demand for hair of unusual colours and shades was behind an outbreak of hair theft in New York City, where \\"the tresses dangling behind the head are ... [an] easy prey.\\" A few months later, a letter to The Times reported that hair thieves were at work in London too: > infesting the thoroughfares and omnibuses of London and stealing hair. A > young friend of ours has just had the whole of her hair cut off in broad > daylight in Westbourne Grove... It is to be hoped that the police will > really endeavour to put a stop to this serious nuisance, otherwise ladies > will be afraid to walk in the streets. It was not only women who were at risk. It was said that during the 18th century, the demand for hair in England was so great that in some places children were forbidden to venture out alone lest they fall victim to hair thieves. The Jacksonville Weekly Sentinel reported on 3 September 1869 that on their arrival at San Francisco, \\"eighty arrived Chinamen had their handsome pig-tails cut off by hair thieves.\\" The Evening Independent of St Petersburg, Florida reported in September 1913: > hair thieves have appeared in the west. They enter homes in the night and > cut the hair from the heads of sleeping women and children. They do not > attempt to move their victims but cut only such hair as can be conveniently > reached without awakening the sleepers. There seems to be an organized gang > of these thieves. No attempt is made at any other form of robbery, the > thieves leaving even watches and jewelry untouched. Women in Wellington, New Zealand were targeted on the streets by an opportunist hair thief in 1914. According to a victim interviewed by the Grey River Argus, \\"For the life of me I couldn't tell you exactly when or where I lost my hair. I didn't feel anything at all ... when opposite Te Aro House, my friend said: 'Oh, someone's cut your hair off!' I laughed and said it was nonsense, but I found it was only too true.\\" In more recent times, outbreaks of hair theft have been reported in several countries in south-east Asia and in South America. A gang of Brazilian hair thieves consisting of \\"a fat man driving a small taxi, a boy about 14 and two women dressed as policewomen\\" were reported to have shorn the hair off 10 women in the municipality of Mogi das Cruzes near São Paulo in 1967. In 2007, women in Myanmar (Burma) fell victim to hair thieves who stole their hair on the street or while commuting. As many Myanmar women have very long hair, reaching to their waists or knees but worn in a ponytail, thieves found it easy to snip it off surreptitiously. The price of hair, at about $445 for , made it a profitable enterprise. More outbreaks of hair theft occurred in Brazil in 2008, the victims including a woman in Aracaju whose -long hair had not been cut in 20 years. In 2013, long- haired people in South Africa and Venezuela were also reported to be the target of gangs of hair thieves. A number of inhabitants of Johannesburg and Durban had their dreadlocks stolen by \\"hair jackers\\", carrying out \\"cut and runs\\" using anything from knives to shards of broken glass. The thieves' motivation was the high price of hair extensions, resulting from a new method of hairstyling known as \\"crocheting\\" that can give recipients an instant set of dreadlocks, which has produced intense competition for supplies of human hair. A Venezuelan gang of hair thieves known as the Piranhas were reported to be operating in broad daylight in shopping malls in the city of Maracaibo. According to news reports, gang members, several of them female, are known to surround their victims, force them to pull their hair back into a ponytail and then cut it off. As many as three cases a day were being reported in August 2013. The President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, pledged to bring the Piranhas to justice: \\"We will capture these people, we will legislate to ban this crime. What sort of aggression is this? Our girls are sacred and we will apply the law with great force.\\" =Sexual hair crime= Not all hair theft is motivated by commercial desire. Sexually motivated hair theft has also been reported – the work of hair fetishists known in the 19th century as \\"plait cutters\\" or \\"hair despoilers\\". They were said to cut off the braids or tresses of girls attending public gatherings and to take their prizes home to be touched, caressed and admired. Hair fetishists also collected commercially available hair products, blurring the distinction between sexual fetishism and a widespread 19th century consumer culture that endorsed \\"collecting, hoarding, displaying, desiring, fondling, possessing and continually looking.\\" In one case reported by The Hairdresser's Journal, a well-to-do German \\"hair fancier\\" was caught after a campaign of hair stealing and was found to have an \\"immense number of beautiful locks [of hair]\\" in his home. The locks were arranged in a cabinet in a kind of museum, \\"together with all particulars of the fair one's name, age, place of residence, and station in life ... in each placed packet containing a lock of ravished hair.\\" See also * Paraphilia * The Rape of the Lock by Alexander Pope References Category:Crimes Category:Human hair ","title":"Hair theft"},{"id":"40252182","text":"Asura geminata is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

In 1888, he exhibited at Bologna: Giornata serena; Gli schiavi bianchi; and Il calzolaio. At the Exhibition of Turin of 1884, he exhibited: Pensieri allegri; Casa rustica, and two landscapes. He also painted portraits. In 1879, his exhibit called \\"A Bread in Two\\" won a prize at an exhibition in Carrara. While he was in the Accademia Libera he became acquainted with numerous realist painters of the time, including Giacomo Favretto, Luigi Nono, Ettore Tito, Vincenzo Irolli and others. This influence of realism in his work remained under the latter stages of his career, when he began painting portraits and idyllic subjects. His brother was the painter Ermenegildo Agazzi (1866 –1945). He was a pupil of Enrico Scuri at the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo. He painted in the Realist style of Cesare Tallone. Later in life, he exhibited at the World Exposition in Paris and the International Exposition in Barcelona.

The bridge and buildings were slightly downstream of the river's lowermost waterfall, a traditional fishing spot for the native inhabitants of the region. Sherar improved the bridge and about of the existing wagon road that crossed it. He and his wife, Jane, operated the Sherar Bridge Hotel from 1871 until their deaths in 1907-08\\\\. A concrete bridge has since replaced Sherar's wooden bridge and carries Oregon Route 216 over the river near the waterfall. Early life Sherar was born in Vermont in 1833 after his parents had immigrated there from Ireland with their first three children. When he was two years old, the family moved to St. Lawrence County in the U.S. state of New York, where Sherar spent the next 20 years. In 1855, Sherar left New York and traveled to California, where he tried mining, hauling goods by pack animal, and then farming along the Klamath River before moving to Oregon in 1862. Operating out of The Dalles, Sherar developed a business hauling supplies over primitive trails to mining camps to the southeast. He and his associates are credited with naming several locations, such as Bakeoven, along their route. In 1863, Sherar married Jane A. Herbert. Born in Illinois in 1848, she had moved to The Dalles with her family in 1850. Selling the pack train business in 1864, the Sherars moved to Dufur, then Tygh Valley. Sherars Bridge In 1871, the Sherars bought land and an existing bridge over the Deschutes River, southwest of Grass Valley in Wasco County. They spent about $7,000 for the properties and later spent another $75,000 improving the wagon road leading to it. The bridge site, below Sherars Falls, was an established site for crossing the river, by boat through the 1850s and by bridge after 1860. The waterfall was a traditional fishing site for the Tygh people (Western Sahaptin Indians), who used wooden platforms and dip nets to catch salmon and steelhead migrating upriver. Jane Sherar Sherar built a stagecoach station and hotel near the bridge, which came to be known as Sherars Bridge. He replaced the existing bridge with a sturdier version, ran it as a toll bridge, and used the income to offset the cost of improving and maintaining the structure. The road, known as The Dalles - Canyon City Wagon Road, was part of what had been used in 1868-70 in the land-grant scheme called The Dalles Military Road. Sherar, employing local Indian laborers, gradually improved the road for on either side of the river. By 1893, the Sherar Bridge Hotel had become a three-story, 33-room inn well-known to travelers to and from central Oregon. The bridge remained important throughout the couple's lives. Jane Sherar died in 1907 and Joseph a year later, before railroad traffic along the river made the bridge less important. Subsequent owners kept the hotel open until a fire destroyed it in 1938. Today, Oregon Route 216 crosses the river over a concrete bridge downstream of Sherars Falls. It is the river's lowermost waterfall, plunging into a horseshoe-shaped trough near the bridge. The waterfall, which is still a tribal fishing site, is on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. Post offices In 1868, Ezra L. Hemingway, an earlier owner of the bridge, had established a post office named Deschutes on land he owned next to the bridge. Joseph Sherar became its postmaster in 1872, and in 1883 the post office was renamed Sherars BridgeOregon Geographic Names, p. 281 or Sherar Bridge. The post office shut down in 1907, reopened in 1922, and was finally closed in 1938.

It was operated by chef Marco Pierre White as a joint venture with the Forte Group. It became a known celebrity hang-out, but went through two legal battles; first with shipbuilders Harland and Wolff and then with Oliver Peyton, proprietor of the Atlantic Bar and Grill which was also within the same hotel. The restaurant was named after the RMS Titanic, precisely because it was located above the Atlantic within the hotel. The menu served a simplified menu compared to White's other restaurants due to the number of covers that the restaurant could hold. The Titanic was poorly received by critics, with criticism directed at both the décor and the food. History The restaurant was located within the Regent Palace Hotel, in central London. The Regent Palace was located directly off Piccadilly Circus The hotel was owned by Forte Group, and already had a restaurant called the Atlantic Bar and Grill which was owned by restaurateur Oliver Peyton. The Titanic was located directly above the Atlantic within the hotel, and Peyton was irritated by diners attempting to book at the Titanic prior to opening by calling his restaurant. Marco Pierre White was the managing partner of the restaurant, being backed by hotel owners Forte. It was named Titanic because it was on top of the Atlantic, and so it was decorated in the style of a liner. White directly linked the restaurant to the RMS Titanic, with the phone number for the restaurant ending in 1912 – the year that the ship sank. The restaurant cost £2 million to decorate, and sat 220 diners. The location also included a members bar, and converted into a night club in the late evenings. White described it as \\"Mirabelle's funky big sister\\". The restaurant held a Christmas party for the magazine Tatler on 1 December 1998, during the week prior to the official launch which took place on 6 December. The opening party was attended by a number of celebrities, including Billy Zane who had recently appeared in the film Titanic (1997), as well as the Spice Girls, All Saints, Goldie, Lenny Kravitz and models Sophie Dahl and Mandy Smith. The restaurant went on to become a celebrity hangout, with David and Victoria Beckham dining there with Ryan Giggs and his guest, and Zane becoming a regular. The restaurant was involved in two legal battles. The first was when shipbuilders Harland and Wolff launched an action due to the use of the name \\"Titanic\\" as the ocean liner was built in their shipyard between 1908–11. The challenge was ridiculed in the British press, with Sebastian Faulks stating in The Evening Standard that \\"A deep-sea diver instructed to work on an 86-year-old shipwreck many fathoms deep off the American coast could so easily be misled into going into a restaurant off Piccadilly Circus that bears the same name.\\" The second was when Peyton launched a legal challenge to the location of the restaurant around the time that it first opened, as his contract with Forte Group had an exclusivity clause. By the time the challenge was launched, Forte had been bought out by Granada plc. Peyton's lawyers offered White the opportunity to settle the case out of court, but he refused. Peyton dropped the injunction and damages case following the second day of the hearing, which resulted in White declaring a victory saying that \\"The Titanic has sailed over the Atlantic – and they have failed to sink us.\\" Peyton subsequently stated that he was never suing White, only the hotel group. It was also mentioned in the press following the reaction of a customer after his credit card was declined. Rupinder Singh had run up a £895 bill, and subsequently issued death threats and punched through a glass wall panel. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to using threatening words and behaviour. By June 2000, the restaurant was no longer opening at lunchtimes and was operating at half capacity. In January 2002, White handed control of the Titanic over to the hotel group. The umbrella group, MPW Criterion, lost £2.24 million during the previous year. Whilst he was in charge of the Titanic, the hotel chain had been repeatedly sold. First from Forte to Granada, then to Compass Group and finally to Japanese investment bank Nomura Group. White described the end of the Titanic, saying that it \\"sank\\". Menu Due to the number of covers, White attempted to keep the menu at the Titanic much simpler than at his other restaurants. Staples such as burgers and french fries were included (listed on the menu as Steak Hache A La MacDonalds), as were Eggs Benedict and corned beef hash with fried eggs and HP Sauce. Desserts included a signature doughnut served with cherry sauce, and brandy snaps with vanilla cream. Reception In January 1999, James Delingpole reviewed the restaurant for The Independent. He found that the wait between courses was long, his food arrived cooked incorrectly or undercooked and found that the waiter didn't know about wine but tried to make it up as he went along. He said that \\"Titanic is a total waste of life and only worth visiting if you're the sort of saddo who thinks it's essential for your credibility to be seen in the latest MPW restaurant\\". Another reviewer for The Independent, Tracey MacLeod, described the interior as an \\"Art-Deco approximation of Hades\\". She ordered the clam chowder but thought it was thin and the potato tasted re-heated. She also thought that the sticky toffee pudding was \\"neither sticky enough nor toffeeish enough\\", but the bread and butter pudding was better. Richard Wallace ate at Titanic in March 1999 and reviewed it for The Daily Mirror. He described the service as \\"first class\\" but that his fries were undercooked. A friend of his thought that the bread and butter pudding was soggy. The Zagat guide stated in its review of Titanic that \\"its standards are sinking without a trace\\". Sebastian Faulks in The Evening Standard took along a younger friend, who praised the roast pheasant and the Caeser Salads.

In his first year, the basketball facilities were not yet completed at the beginning of the season, so players began individual workouts on outdoor courts. His first office was in a trailer. Despite having no experience as a team, the Eagles opened their season against Ohio Dominican and won. Then they won their next game, and the next, and continued winning until they faced St. Francis of Indiana, who beat the Eagles to give them their first loss. That would be the last loss of the season, as they went on to a thirty win season, with a 30–1 record. The team continued to pile up winning records, and went on to post a 29–2 record in and earn an invitation to the DII post-season tournament in 2006. The team would advance as far as the Regional semi-final. After reaching a national DII ranking of eleven, the team faced ninth ranked Rollins, and won 48–46.

The team earned invitations to the post-season WNIT tournament, advancing to the second round in 2008 and 2009. In 2011, the team would go 28–4 overall, with a 17–3 record in conference. That record was the best in conference, resulting in the first regular season conference title for the Eagles. The team would not become a full member of the conference until August of that year, so was not part of the conference post-season tournament. They did participate in the 2011 WNIT, beating Drexel in the first round before losing to Florida in the second round. In 2012, their first year of eligibility for the Atlantic Sun post-season tournament, they went undefeated in conference play, with an 18–0 as part of an overall 29–3 record. They won the conference tournament, earning a bid to the NCAA tournament. They took on St. Bonaventure in their first NCAA game and took the Bonnies to overtime, before succumbing 72–65. The following year, the team also went undefeated in regular season conference play, but ended up with a loss to Stetson in the conference championship game. Although the team had lost eight players from the year before, they had won all their conference games by double digits. They held a double-digit lead in the conference final, but then went on a long scoreless streak, allowing the Hatters to get back into the game and win, 70–64.

After taking a brief, one-point lead early in the second half, the Blue Demons took back the lead, and extended it to nine points with under eight minutes to go. The lead was still eight points with just over two minutes left, when Taylor Gradinjan was fouled on a three- point attempt, and hit all three free throws.

Sumsum is often cooked as soup or as gulai (a curry-like dish). In India and Pakistan, slow-cooked marrow is the core ingredient of the dish nalli nihari. In China, pig tibia is used to make slow- cooked soup, with one or both ends of the tibia chopped off. After the soup is done, the marrow would be scooped out with chopsticks. In some restaurants, cooked pig tibia would be served with a drinking straw specifically for sucking out the semi-liquified marrow. In Hungary, tibia is a main ingredient of beef soup; the bone is chopped into 10–15 cm pieces, and the ends are covered with salt to prevent the marrow from leaking from the bone while cooking. Upon serving the soup, the marrow is usually spread on toast. Beef bone marrow is also a main ingredient in Italian dish ossobuco (braised veal shanks); the shanks are cross-cut and served bone-in, with the marrow still inside the bone. Beef marrow bones are often included in the French pot-au-feu broth, the cooked marrow being traditionally eaten on toasted bread with sprinkled coarse sea salt. In Iranian cuisine, lamb shanks are usually broken before cooking to allow diners to suck out and eat the marrow when the dish is served. Similar practices are also common in Indian, Pakistani and Lebanese cuisine. Some Native Alaskans eat the bone marrow of caribou and moose. In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sapu Mhichā, which is a leaf tripe bag stuffed with bone marrow, is a delicacy served during special occasions. The bag is boiled and fried, and is eaten when the marrow is still molten.

History  The Knights and Ladies of Honor originated as a splinter group of the Knights of Honor, a fraternal secret society founded in 1873. In 1875, the Knight of Honor created an auxiliary, the Degree of Protection, open the wives, mothers, widows and unmarried daughters and sisters of members of the Knights of Honor, as well as male members of the parent order. The only a few lodges of the auxiliary were formed in the years between its creation and May 1877, when the Supreme Lodge of the Knights of Honor abolished the auxiliary. On September 6, 1877 representatives of the lodges of the Degree met in convention in Louisville, Kentucky, and decided to form their own organization. This convention elected a \\"Provisional Supreme Lodge\\", which included, among others, J. A. Demaree, one of the original founders of the Knights of Honor. The first official meeting of the \\"Supreme Lodge of Protection, Knights of and Ladies of Honor\\" was held on September 19, 1878 in St. Louis and the order was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky on the following April. On December 14, 1881 the General Assembly of Kentucky amended its charter slightly, changing its name from the Order of Protection of the Knights and Ladies of Honor to the Order of the Knights and Ladies of Honor.Stevens, Albert C.

B. Treat and Company, New York p.142  Organization  The Knights and Ladies of Honor were organized on a three tier system with local Subordinate Lodges, state level Grand Lodges and governed by a national Supreme Lodge. There were 16 Grand Lodges in 1896.Stevens p.143 Its headquarters was in Indianapolis, Indiana.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1930, p.175  Membership and Benefits  Membership in the Knights and Ladies of Honor was open to acceptable white men and women between the ages of eighteen to fifty who was in a reputable profession, business or occupation. One of its goals was \\"to give all moral and material aid in its power\\" to its members and their dependents by holding \\"moral, literary and scientific\\" lectures as well as assisting each other to obtain employment and encouraging each other in business. There was an optional relief fund which was divided into four \\"divisions\\" for $500, $1000, $2000 and $3,000. Upon the death of a member a sum of money was given to that members designee's were given the sum of money the deceased contributed in life as well as the amount specified on his certificate.Stevens p.142 On June 30, 1878 it had 907 male members and 1,018 females, for a total of 1,925.

In 1916 older members of the group appealed to the New York State Department of Insurance to protect their interests, claiming that the assessments were exorbitant and was half a million dollars behind on its death benefits. In one case an 84-year-old man was paying an $18.40 assessment, 922% more than he had originally paid when he joined the order forty years prior.Preuss p.213  References   See also  *List of North American fraternal benefit orders *Degree of Honor Protective Association  External links  * Category:Fraternal orders Category:Organizations established in 1877 Category:American secret societies ","title":"Knights and Ladies of Honor"},{"id":"40253124","text":"Qarehi (, also Romanized as Qareh’ī; also known as Qarā’ī) is a village in Qaleh Juq Rural District, Anguran District, Mahneshan County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

Major airports near the park's proximity are Mwanza Airport (166 km to Ndabaka Gate), Arusha Airport (226 km) and Kilimanjaro International Airport (284 km). Therefore, in order to minimize the travel time and distance, the government has decided to construct an international airport 40 km outside the park's north-western precincts. American investor Paul Tudor Jones has agreed to finance the project. Project The airport will be located in the Uwanja wa Ndege ward of Mugumu town in Serengeti District, Mara Region in northern Tanzania. It will cost about US$350 million and is expected to boost the number of visitors from the present 0.8 to 1.6 million whilst also doubling the revenue to US$2.8 billion. The length of the single runway is expected to be between 3,800 and 4,200 metres. =Proponents= * Former Prime Minister Edward Lowassa said that the plan to construct the airport, hotels and roads would proceed in spite of opposition.

Herbert is also director of the TRANSCEND program at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. Education Herbert graduated, and received her medical degree, from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons after obtaining a doctoral degree at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She trained in evolutionary biology and the development of learning processes, and performed postdoctoral work in the philosophy and history of science. Career Herbert began seeing patients in a psychiatry clinic in 1996; these patients suffered from a variety of psychological disabilities, including headaches, seizures, behavioral-control problems, obsessions, and tics. However, as time went on she began seeing a higher proportion of autistic children. Around the same time, she was conducting a number of neuroimaging studies on differences in the brains of autistic children, and as a result of this research, she concluded that autism is a disorder that affects the entire body, not just the brain. Autism research Herbert has claimed that many children with autism have biomedical problems, and that these problems exacerbate the symptoms of autism. Her research focuses on attributing the development of autism to the existence of certain predisposing genes, with her coauthors on this topic including Peter Szatmari. In addition, some of her research focuses on the possible existence of enlarged superficial white matter in the brains of people with autism, as well as developmental language disorder. =Views on environmental autism causes= More recently, Herbert published an opinion paper in 2010 which argued, among other things, that \\"Systemic and central nervous system pathophysiology, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction can be consistent with a role for environmental influence,\\" as well as a case report in the Journal of Child Neurology, which described a patient with autistic symptoms who improved markedly after she was placed on a gluten-free, casein-free diet. Herbert has been a regular presenter at anti-vaccine conferences. Herbert's view of environmental causes of autism has been ruled inadmissible by a Massachusetts Superior Court judge, who said \\"Dr. Herbert’s method is not generally accepted in the scientific community. Dr. Herbert’s theory of environmental triggers of autism may some day prove true. It has not yet. Her proffered testimony does not meet the standard of reliability required by the case law, and cannot be admitted in evidence at trial.\\" Herbert has threatened to sue journalists for reporting her views. =The Autism Revolution= Herbert is also the author of a book, The Autism Revolution: Whole-Body Strategies for Making Life All It Can Be, published in 2012 by Ballantine Books. In the book, she recounts stories of children with autism who followed recommendations to receive unconventional autism treatments, and whose conditions improved--\\"sometimes dramatically so\\", according to Herbert.

Origin The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. One such unit was the Paddington Rifles, raised at Hermitage Street, Paddington, on 29 February 1860, which became the 36th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (Paddington Rifles).Paddington Rifles at Regiments.orgWestlake, pp. 172–3.Beckett, Appendix VIII. Major-General David Downing (1802–88), late of the Bengal Army, became the unit's first commanding officer (CO).Hodson. In line with the Volunteers' raison d'etre, the Paddington Rifles adopted the motto 'Arm for Peace'.Beckett, p. 25. The unit had two companies on parade at the first Volunteer Review held in Hyde Park in 1860, with recruitment for a third well under way. Soon afterwards the Paddington Rifles had four companies, a cadet corps and a drum and bugle band. Headquarters was at the Vestry Hall of St Mary's Church, Paddington Green, with weapons stored and drills carried out at the Hermitage Street Fire Station across Harrow Road. The Corps also had the use of two riding schools, Pearce's in Westbourne Grove and Gapp's in Gloucester Terrace. After undergoing 30 recruit drills in their first 18 months in the unit, the basic annual requirement for Volunteers was to attend six company drills, three battalion drills and the annual inspection, but many enthusiastic volunteers did far more than this, In July 1861 the 36th Middlesex RVC held morning and evening drills every weekday leading up to that year's grand Volunteer Review on Wimbledon Common.Beckett, p. 113. Discipline was, however, often lacking, and in December 1860 Maj-Gen Downing, had to appeal to his men to avoid insubordination. The following year he was openly criticised in the Paddington Newsman by his own officers. His successor, Lt-Col William Wood (late Royal Marines), appointed 12 March 1861, received the same treatment in the Paddington Times in April 1868.Beckett, pp. 175–6.Army List various dates. On 22 July 1869, Wood became Honorary Colonel of the unit and was replaced as CO by Gordon Maynard Ives (later Girdon-Ives) of Bentworth Hall (1837–1907), formerly of the Coldstream Guards.Geneaology inks.org. In 1868 a boy was killed on the unit's rifle range. Expansion In 1869 the Vestry Hall began to be converted into Paddington Town Hall, and the Rifles had to find a temporary HQ above the 'King and Queen' public house in Harrow Road. Later it moved across Paddington Green into Greville House. By 1870 the unit had at least seven companies, with No 7 Company at Kensal Green being made up mainly from employees of the Metropolitan Railway. In 1880 there was a reorganisation of the RVCs and the unit was renumbered as the 18th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps (Paddington Rifles), consisting of 12 companies. Under the Childers Reforms of 1881 it became the 5th (later 4th) Volunteer Bn of the Rifle Brigade, without changing its title. It remained a 'Middlesex' unit even after its recruiting area became part of the new County of London in 1889. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1. The Paddington Rifles formed part of the North London Brigade.Monthly Army Lists, 1889–1914. The continued expansion of the battalion – transport and ambulance sections had been added – led to overcrowding at Greville House, and in 1895 the unit acquired property at 207–9 Harrow Road with sufficient land to build a drill hall and rifle range. It moved into this new HQ on 31 March 1896. During the Second Boer War the battalion formed a service company of volunteers to serve alongside the Regulars, earning the Battle honour South Africa 1900–1902. Other members, including the second-in-command, Lt-Col A.G. Pawle, served with the City Imperial Volunteers (CIV).London Gazette, 10 September 1901.Louis Creswicke, South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol 3. Freemasons within the unit formed their own Masonic lodge (Paddington Rifles No 2807) in 1900. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, all of the Volunteer Battalions in the Central London area became part of the all- Territorial London Regiment and were numbered sequentially through the London brigades and divisions, with the Paddington Rifles becoming 10th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Paddington) in the 3rd London Brigade in 1st London Division.Martin.Money Barnes, Appendix IV.Westlake. Disbandment In later years the battalion suffered from poor recruitment, and it failed to meet its required establishment. As a result, the Paddington Rifles was disbanded on 31 May 1912 and replaced by a new 10th Battalion, London Regiment (Hackney Rifles), while the 3rd (City of London) Battalion (Royal Fusiliers) took over its battalion HQ at Harrow Road, and absorbed many of its personnel.3rd City of London at Regiments.org Uniform From at least 1876 (ie well before it became a Volunteer Battalion of the Rifle Brigade) the Paddington Rifles wore a Rifle green uniform with black facings, and as a rifle unit it was never issued with colours.Money Barnes, Appendix III.

It saw action at Gallipoli, in Palestine and on the Western Front during World War I. In World War II it served in the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, then in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. Volunteers The unit began as the Clerkenwell Rifles, formed in the Clerkenwell and Finsbury districts of London during the invasion scare of 1859–60 that led to the creation of hundreds of Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs).Beckett.H.R. Martin, p. 1.Finsbury Rifles at Regiments.org It was adopted by the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex as the 39th Middlesex RVC, and he issued the first officers' commissions on 6 March 1860, the commanding officer (CO) being Lieutenant-Colonel Colvill, Governor of Coldbath Fields Prison and a former Captain in the 71st Foot. The corps was based at 16 Cold Bath Square, Clerkenwell. Colvill was later obliged to relinquish the command by the Middlesex magistrates, who considered it incompatible with his prison duties.Westlake, p. 174.London Gazette 23 March 1860.Beckett, p. 94 and Appendix VII.H.R. Martin, p. 2. He was replaced as CO by Major Henry Penton (1817–1882) of the 3rd (Royal Westminster) Middlesex Militia, a local landowner in Clerkenwell whose grandfather had developed the district of Pentonville.Monthly Army List.Survey of London, Vol 47, at British History Online The unit's HQ later moved to 17 Penton Street in Pentonville,Finsbury Rifles at Stepping Out. and it became known from the beery ways of its members as the 'Pentonville Pissers'.Holmes, p. 109. Together with the Central London Rangers, the Clerkenwell unit initially formed the 3rd Middlesex Administrative Battalion of RVCs, but because both units soon consisted of eight companies they were made independent battalions and the administrative battalion disbanded. In 1862 The Finsbury Rifle Volunteer Corps was officially added to its title, and it continued to expand, reaching a strength of 10 companies in 1870. Other Middlesex RVCs had been less successful and disappeared, so the Finsbury Rifles became the 21st Middlesex RVC in a general renumbering carried out in 1880. Following the Childers Reforms the Finsbury Rifles became the 7th Volunteer Battalion of the Kings Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) in 1881, but without changing its title. It had already adopted the Rifle green uniform with red Facing colour of the KRRC.H.R. Martin, pp. 4–5.Barnes, Appendix III. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1. Under this scheme the Finsbury Rifles formed part of the North London Brigade which would assemble at Caterham under the command of the CO of the Coldstream Guards. During the Second Boer War the battalion was increased from ten to 12 companies, and formed a service company of volunteers to serve alongside the Regulars in South Africa, earning the Battle honour South Africa 1900–1902.Leslie. Territorial Force The Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. The Borough of Finsbury had been incorporated into the new County of London since 1900, and so the unit joined the newly-created London Regiment, which consisted entirely of TF infantry battalions, with no Regular component. It became the 11th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Finsbury Rifles), with its headquarters and all eight companies located at 17 Penton Street. The North London Brigade became 3rd London Brigade in the TF's 1st London Division.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Barnes, Appendix IV.H.R. Martin, pp. 6–7.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 141–7. World War I =Mobilisation= Annual training for 1st London Division had just started when war was declared on 4 August 1914, and the Finsbury Rifles promptly mustered at Pentonville for mobilisation. Several battalions of the division were soon posted away to relieve Regular Army garrisons in the Mediterranean or to supplement the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. By January 1915, only the Finsbury and Hackney battalions remained with the artillery and other support elements of the division, and these were attached to the 2nd-Line TF division (2/1st London Division) that was being formed. Meanwhile, the Finsbury Rifles formed its own second line, the two units being designated 1/11th and 2/11th Battalions.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9–15.56th (1st London) Division at Long, Long Trail58th (2/1st London) Division at Long, Long TrailLondon Regt at Long, Long Trail =1/11th Battalion= Suvla Bay In April 1915, the 1/10th (Hackney) and 1/11th (Finsbury Rifles) Bns were sent to Norwich to join 162nd (East Midland) Brigade in 54th (East Anglian) Division, which was being prepared for overseas service. At the end of July the battalion embarked at Liverpool aboard the RMS Aquitania bound for the Mediterranean, and arrived at Mudros on 6 August. After transferring to a smaller vessel it landed on 11 August at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The Gallipoli Campaign had been in progress for several months and had reached stalemate. The Landing at Suvla Bay on 6 August had been a flank attack designed to manoeuvre the Turks out of their defences, but it too became bogged down in trench warfare.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 125–31.Westlake, Gallipoli, pp. 241–2. On 15 August the battalion took part in the action at Kiretch Tepe Ridge, where 162nd Bde's task was to protect the flank of the two attacking brigades. Little fighting was anticipated. There was no time to reconnoitre and the brigade advanced towards the lower slopes of the ridge with 'no information about the probable whereabouts of the enemy'. After about 400 yards the leading battalion, the 1/5th Bedfordshire Regiment, came under increasing rifle and machine-gun fire in the gullies and lost cohesion. Parties of the 1/10th and 1/11th Londons were 'dribbled forward' to reinforce the line.Aspinall-Oglander, p. 322. The battalions 'gallantly breasted the gully-riven slopes of the ridge, and ultimately advanced the left of the line to the south-western shoulder of Kidney Hill'.North, pp. 178–9. But they were unsupported, and withdrew that night to positions in Lone Tree Gully. Major G.F.M. Davies of 1/11th Londons was killed while covering the retreat of the rear party.Aspinall-Oglander, p. 323. Lone Tree Gully was shelled all the next day. The battalion's total casualties in the two days were about 360. Over the next two months the 1/11th Bn alternated in the firing line with the 1/5th Bedfords; when not in the line the battalion was in reserve at 'Finsbury Vale'. In October the dismounted 1/1st Suffolk Yeomanry were attached to the Londons for training, and then relieved the battalion, which went into a rest camp dubbed 'Penton Hill' from 26 to 31 October. During November the battalion alternated with the Suffolk Yeomanry in the line. The 1/11th Bn was evacuated to Mudros on 3 December, and shortly afterwards the Gallipoli operation was closed down. Egypt The 54th Division, very weak from battle casualties and sickness, was re-embarked on 13 December and landed at Alexandria in Egypt on 18 December. After recuperating, most of the division moved into the Suez Canal defences at the end of March 1916. It stayed there under the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) until the beginning of 1917.Sainsbury, pp. 46–50. Palestine \\"Finsbury Rifles attacking Gaza, Tuesday 17th April 1917\\"; panel on Finsbury War Memorial, Spa Green, Clerkenwell. By mid-January 1917, 54th Division had been concentrated at Moascar for the start of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. After a difficult crossing of the Sinai Desert, the division closed up to join the EEF's attack on Gaza.Burrows, pp. 112, 133.Sainsbury, pp. 50–4. 162nd Brigade had only a peripheral part in the First Battle of Gaza (26–27 March), when 161st (Essex) Brigade took the objective but due to confusion was pulled back after dark.Bullock, pp. 44–6.Burrows, pp. 143–77. For the Second Battle of Gaza, 54th Division was to advance and then wheel left to attack the Ali Muntar ridge outside Gaza. 162nd Brigade, with 1/11th Londons as support battalion, formed the division's left, with its flank on the point where Wadi Mukkademe crossed the Gaza-Beersheba road. The advance began promptly at 07.20 on 19 April, but it soon became clear that the bombardment of the enemy trenches by artillery and naval guns had failed in its effects. The division's leading battalions came under well-directed artillery fire and intense machine gun fire as they approached the trenches. 162nd Brigade attacked towards the trench complex known as 'The Beer' and made the furthest advance but were forced back at the end of the disastrous day.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 336–9.Bullock, p. 49. Capture of Gaza The EEF did not make another attempt to take Gaza until November, after months of preparation. As part of the operation to clear the Gaza–Beersheba Line (the Third Battle of Gaza, 27 October–7 November), 54th Division attacked directly towards the town on 2 November. It was a holding attack but the leading brigades made such good progress that 162nd Bde was able to pass through by 06.00 to move on to the final objective, Sheikh Hasan, which it secured after a 15-minute bombardment. The attack was continued on 7 November, with 162nd Bde heading towards Turtle Hill, north west of Gaza town. Supported by powerful artillery, the infantry walked through the defences to find that the Turks had evacuated Gaza.Bullock, p. 75.Burrows, pp. 213–5.Sainsbury, pp. 62–8. The EEF pursued the defeated Turks back to the Jaffa–Jerusalem defence line, and Jerusalem fell on 7 December.Bullock, pp. 77–81, 89–94. Jaffa The Jock Christie, VC, memorial at Euston Station. As a preliminary to the Battle of Jaffa planned for the night of 20/21 December, the 1/11th Londons were ordered to seize a hill from which enfilade fire could be brought onto Bald Hill, 350 yards away and one of the key objectives for the following night's attack. An officer of the supporting artillery described the Finsbury Rifles as 'very short of men and the commanding officer was only a captain, so great had been their losses, but they were very gallant fellows'.Sainsbury, p. 73. Their charge was preceded by a five minute bombardment by three field batteries, during which the enemy put down a counter-barrage along the edge of Bald Hill and manned their trenches. The attack on the other hill therefore came as a surprise, and the 1/11th Bn seized it with little loss, and then held it against three determined counter-attacks in the next two hours. Delivered over open ground, these attacks were easily beaten off by machine gun and rifle fire. Bombing attacks up the trenches were more dangerous, but one such attack was driven off single-handedly by Lance-Corporal John Alexander Christie, who went forward 50 yards from his own line and scattered them with grenades. 'Jock' Christie was awarded the VC.Falls, Vol II, pp. 274–5. Tell 'Asur The EEF began a new phase of offensive operation in March 1918, the so-called Actions of Tel 'Asur. At dawn on 12 March, 162nd Brigade assaulted behind a creeping barrage, 'The infantry – Londons and Bedfords – were seen to disappear into the wadis in the pale light and then to reappear scrambling up the steep hillsides like lines of ants'.Sainsbury, pp. 76–7. Having occupied a much better line, the 54th Division settled down to a defensive routine. The next operation began on 9 April at Berukin, but 162nd Bde's planned attack on 14 April was cancelled at the last moment. 54th Division was now warned to prepare to move to reinforce the BEF on the Western Front following its defeats during the German Spring Offensive. This move was however cancelled in July, and the EEF reorganised for operations in the autumn to complete the Turkish defeat.Sainsbury, pp. 77–81. Megiddo The culminating Battle of Megiddo began with the Battle of Sharon. On the opening day, 19 September, the 1/11th Londons were assigned to escort the divisional artillery and cover the gap between the 54th Division and the 3rd (Lahore) Division while the rest of 162nd Bde made a difficult attack alongside the Essex Brigade.Falls, Vol II, p. 475.Sainsbury, pp. 82–6. The Turks quickly collapsed, and as the Desert Mounted Corps pursued them to Aleppo the infantry of 54th Division were left far behind. By the time the division reached Beirut at the end of October, hostilities were brought to an end by the Armistice of Mudros.Bullock, pp. 142–6.Sainsbury, pp. 86–7. The battalion was demobilised in Egypt and its personnel shipped home during 1919. =2/11th Battalion= The 2/1st London Division concentrated in East Anglia round Ipswich in August 1915, and was numbered as 58th (2/1st London) Division; the 2/11th Londons were in 175th (2/3rd London) Brigade. Although the division formed part of First Army of Central Force, no serious training could be undertaken because of lack of equipment. At first the only small arms available were .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles. In the Spring of 1916 the division took over a sector of the East Coast defences, digging many trenches. Finally it received Lee-Enfield service rifles and on 10 July 1916 it concentrated at Sutton Veny for final training on Salisbury Plain.David Martin, pp. 15–28, 33–5. France In January 1917 the 58th Division moved to Southampton and embarked for France, landing at Le Havre. The 175th Bde was the last to arrive, and the division eventually concentrated at Lucheux on 8 February. The battalions were introduced to trench warfare by companies, being attached to battalions of the 46th (North Midland) and 49th (West Riding) Divisions. From March to April the 58th Division followed up the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and was then put to work to repair the roads and railways destroyed by the retreating enemy.D. Martin, pp. 36–7. Bullecourt The 58th Division's first offensive operation was a peripheral part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt (4–17 May), for which 175th Bde was attached to 2nd Australian Division. On 17 May the 2/11th Bn provided two companies to act as stretcher bearers, suffering 30 casualties in so doing. For the next few weeks the division was engaged in small actions against the Hindenburg Line, and then went into a period of intensive battle training in old German trenches. 175th Brigade was then assigned to railway construction at Achiet-le-Grand near Arras.David Martin, pp. 37–40. Ypres Captured German pillbox or 'Mebu' at Passchendaele After a period of trench holding near Arras, the 58th Division moved to the Ypres Salient in late August 1917, with 2/11th Bn being one of the first units going into the line, taking over positions at St Julien. To minimise casualties, the line was held by a series of outposts.David Martin, pp. 45–6. In the attack of 20 September (the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge), 2/11th Bn was in reserve with 175th Bde.David Martin, p. 55. 175th Brigade led the division's attack at the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September), with 2/11th Bn in support. Afterwards the 58th Division went into reserve.David Martin, pp. 63–6. Passchendaele mud The division returned to the line for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October). As it arrived, the weather broke, and the division was forced to jump off from a line of flooded craters in the Poelcapelle area and struggle forward behind a barrage that advanced too quickly. 2/11th Battalion was one of those sent up immediately afterwards to relieve the exhausted attackers.David Martin, p. 89. By now the BEF was suffering a serious manpower crisis and roughly a quarter of its infantry battalions were disbanded. The 2/11th Bn was one of those chosen, and it was disbanded on 31 January 1918. The men were drafted to the 1/20th, 1/21st and 1/22nd Bns London Regiment in 47th (2nd London) Division). =3/11th Battalion= A 3rd-Line reserve battalion was formed in early 1915 and designated the 3/11th. By April it was at Tadworth, training on Epsom Downs before moving to winter billets in Sutton in October 1915. It moved to Fovant in the Salisbury Plain training area in January 1916. The unit was redesignated the 11th Reserve Bn, London Regiment, in the 1st London Reserve Group on 8 April, and absorbed by the 9th Reserve Bn on 1 September 1916. Throughout the war it trained recruits and prepared them for drafting to the service battalions overseas.TF Training Bns at Warpath Interwar The Finsbury Rifles were reconstituted in 1920 in the renamed Territorial Army (TA). The London Regiment no longer existed, so its battalions were designated as regiments in their own right, the Finsbury Rifles becoming 11th London Regiment (Finsbury Rifles), once again affiliated to the KRRC, but now in 142nd (6th London) Brigade of 47th (2nd London) Division.H.R. Martin, p. 16.Titles and Designations. In 1935 the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence, particularly for London, was addressed by converting the 47th (2nd London) Division into the 1st Anti-Aircraft Division. A number of London infantry battalions were also converted to the AA role, the 11th Londons being transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) on 15 December 1935 as 61st (Finsbury Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery), with the following organisation:H.R. Martin, p. 17.Frederick, pp. 754–6, 770.Litchfield, p. 177. * HQ at Pentonville *170 AA Battery at Finchley *171 AA Battery at Pentonville *195 AA Battery at Finchley (raised by April 1938) * AA Machine Gun Battery at Pentonville (redesignated 224 Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) Battery in 1937) Despite their transfer to the RA, the personnel continued to wear their Finsbury Rifles cap badge.Litchfield, pp. 168–9.Anon, Badges. The 61st AA Bde formed part of 28th (Thames and Medway) Anti-Aircraft Group of 1 AA Division, but in May 1938 it joined a new 37th AA Bde based in North London. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. With the expansion of the TA after the Munich Crisis, most units split to form duplicates. In the case of 61st AA Bde, 224 LAA Bty was expanded into a full regiment in October as 12th (Finsbury Rifles) Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, with 33–35 LAA Btys and a new 44 LAA Bty formed on 16 January 1939, while 61st adopted 'Middlesex' as its subtitle and formed a new 272 Bty at Southgate on 1 November. On formation the new 12th LAA Bde chose to show its ancestral links to the Finsbury Rifles and KRRC by wearing a black KRRC button on the shoulder straps of their tunics and battledress blouses. On 1 January 1939 the RA adopted the more normal designations of 'regiments' for 'brigades'.Frederick, pp. 800, 821. By April 1939 272 Bty had left 61st AA Rgt to become the basis of a new 90th AA Rgt in 37th AA Bde. World War II =Mobilisation= In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command and 37th AA Brigade was transferred to a new 6th AA Division in May. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371.AA Command on 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesTable LX, p. 378. =61st (Middlesex) HAA Regiment= 37th AA Brigade operated a layout of gun sites from Dagenham to Thorpe Bay in Essex, along the north side of the Thames Estuary, known as 'Thames North'. Opportunities for action were rare during the Phoney War, but on the night of 22/23 November 1939 the Thames North guns combined with those of 28 AA Bde on the other bank of the river ('Thames South') to engage at least two enemy mine-laying aircraft that had strayed into the mouth of the Estuary. One wrecked aircraft was found on the marshes.Routledge, pp. 374–5, 388. On 1 June 1940 the RA's AA regiments equipped with 3-inch or 3.7-inch guns were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the newer LAA regiments.61 HAA Rgt at RA 39–45. Battle of Britain By 11 July 1940, the Thames North AA layout operated by 37 AA Bde had a total of 46 HAA guns (3.7-inch and even 4.5-inch).Farndale, p. 106. The brigade was heavily engaged throughout the Battle of Britain On 22 August, for example, a mass raid flew up the Thames Estuary to attack RAF Hornchurch on the Essex shore: the raid was broken up by 37 and 28 AA Bdes, and then the fighters of No. 11 Group RAF attacked. Follow-up raids were marked for the fighters by 'pointer' rounds of HAA fire. On 2 September another mass raid arrived over the Medway and flew up the Thames towards Hornchurch. They came under heavy fire from the 3.7s and 4.5s of 28 and 37 AA Bdes and 15 were shot down before the fighters took over. On 7 September heavy raids up the estuary attacked oil wharves at Thameshaven, Tilbury Docks and Woolwich Arsenal: a total of 25 aircraft were destroyed by AA guns and fighters.Routledge, pp. 385–6.Farndale, p. 109. On 15 September, remembered as the climax of the battle, 220 bombers attacked London in the morning despite heavy casualties inflicted by the RAF fighters. More attacks came in the afternoon and the AA guns around London, particularly Thames North, were continuously in action. Between the guns and fighters, the Luftwaffe lost 85 aircraft that day, an unsustainable rate of loss.Farndale, p. 110. The Blitz After 15 September the intensity of Luftwaffe day raids declined rapidly, and it began a prolonged night bombing campaign over London and industrial towns (The Blitz). This meant that the Thames North guns were in action night after night as the bomber streams approached the London Inner Artillery Zone, but even with the assistance of searchlights, the effectiveness of HAA fire and fighters was greatly diminished in the darkness. 61st HAA Regiment served throughout this period.Routledge, pp. 387–95, Table LXV, p. 396.6 AA Division at RA 39–45.Farndale, Annex D.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. Iraq 61st HAA Regiment was next selected to be sent to the Middle East. It left AA Command in September and by 8 December 1941 it was in 8th AA Bde in Tenth Army in Iraq and Persia. Tenth Army was being built ip to counter the threat from air raids on the vital oil installations if the German Army on the Eastern Front penetrated into the Caucasus. The tasks allotted to 8th AA Bde were defence of the Basra base area, RAF Habbaniya, Mosul and the oil installations at Kirkuk. These widely spread Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) generally received one HAA battery and one LAA battery each.Routledge, p. 199. The German threat to the Persian oilfields never materialised, but Tenth Army found a secondary role in acclimatising units before they went on active service in North Africa. Hence 61st HAA Rgt left 8th AA Bde in March 1942 to move to Middle East Forces (MEF) in Egypt to bolster the AA defences of the Suez Canal. Egypt In April, RHQ 61st HAA Rgt with its signal section, Royal Corps of Signals, and Royal Army Ordnance Corps workshop was ordered down from Tell El Kebir in the Nile Delta to Suez, arriving on 21 May.HQ AADC Egypt Operation Instruction No 7, April 1942, in 89 HAA Rgt and AADC Suez War Diary, 1942, TNA file WO 169/4808. During the summer the regiment took charge of all HAA batteries on the eastern side of the canal at the Suez end under 89th (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt, whose CO was AA Defence Commander (AADC), Suez. These 3.7-inch gun sites were manned by 170 and 171 Btys of 61st HAA Rgt, together with 5 HAA Bty, Royal Malta Artillery manning two 4.5-inch guns and Z Battery rocket projectors.89 HAA Rgt and AADC Suez War Diary, 1942, TNA file WO 169/4808. By September 1942, with Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika at El Alamein, just 66 miles (106 km) from Alexandria, Luftwaffe reconnaissance raids over Suez Bay and the docks and oil refinery at Port Tewfik became common. Later that month, 61st HAA Rgt was relieved at Suez and in October, at the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, it was part of 17th AA Bde, assigned to Eighth Army and held in reserve for the breakthrough and advance into Libya.Routledge, Table XXIII, p. 161. In January 1943, as Eighth Army swept westwards, 17th AA Bde, including 61st HAA with all three of its batteries, was defending the port of Tobruk and its airfields at El Adem and Gambut. It was still in these positions in May when the Tunisian Campaign ended.Routledge, p. 157; Table XXIV, p. 162; Table XXV, p. 164. Sicily 61st HAA Regiment was not involved in the assault phase of the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) (see below), but moved to the island when it became the base for the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943. RHQ, 170 Bty and half of 171 Bty, with a total of 12 3.7-inch guns, were under 73rd AA Bde defending the ferry port of Milazzo. By January 1944 the regiment, now at full strength, was defending the port of Augusta.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267; Table XLIII, p. 268. Italy 61st HAA Regiment crossed to mainland Italy in September 1944 and joined 25 AA Bde, which was responsible for defending the ports of Bari, Barletta, Brindisi and Manfredonia in Apulia. Bari in particular had continued to attract attention from Luftwaffe night bombers after the disastrous raid of December 1943. 25th AA Brigade HQ was relieved of its tasks in south east Italy in December 1944, and 61st HAA Rgt came under the command of 22nd AA Bde.Routledge, pp. 290–1; Table XVVII, pp. 296–7. The long static spell was broken by the Allied breakthrough in April 1945. 61st HAA Regiment was sent across Italy to join 66th AA Bde (in which 12th (Finsbury Rifles) LAA Rgt was serving in an infantry and field artillery role, see below). The brigade was sent 100 miles north to defend Genoa, and it was AA advance parties who actually captured the city with little difficulty. Early in May the requirement for AA defence ended when the Surrender of Caserta came into force.Routledge, p. 286. Regimental HQ with 171 and 195 HAA Btys was placed in suspended animation on 1 September 1945; 170 HAA Bty followed on 27 October. =12th (Finsbury Rifles) LAA Regiment= On the outbreak of war this regiment was in London District, but shortly afterwards was assigned to a new 56th Light AA Bde. This was formed in 6th AA Division on 30 September 1939 with responsibility for defending airfields in South East England.12 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. 44 (Finsbury Rifles) LAA Battery : On 15 February 1940, 44 LAA Bty went to Fleet, Hampshire, France to help form a new 101 LAA/Anti-Tank Rgt for 1st Support Group in 1st Armoured Division with the BEF. It sailed for France on 16 May when the Battle of France had already begun. It immediately went into action to hold crossings over the Seine until the tanks arrived, though the LAA batteries only had Lewis gunss. It took part in the Battle of Abbeville and then, when the bulk of the BEF had been evacuated from Dunkirk the remnants of the Support Group fought on until they were evacuated from western France in Operation Ariel (15–17 June).101 LAA/AT Rgt at RA 39–45.Farndale, pp. 17, 86–8.Ellis, Chapter XVIII.Ellis, Chapter XIX.Ellis, Chapter XXI. 101st LAA/AT Rgt was broken up in November 1940, but 44 LAA Bty did not return to its parent unit. Instead it joined a new 61st LAA Rg in 1st Support Group, with which it fought in North Africa.61 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. Meanwhile, the rest of 12th LAA Rgt was serving in 6th AA Bde in 6th AA Division, responsible for AA defence of RAF airfields in Essex during the Battle of Britain and early part of the Blitz. By May 1941 it was in 60th AA Bde in 8th AA Division, responsible for covering Yeovil, Exeter and Portland. Middle East In March 1942 the regiment began the two-month voyage to the Middle East, joining 8th AA Bde of Tenth Amy in Iraq in May. In September it transferred to Persia and Iraq Command (PAIFORCE), and then in May 1943 moved on to MEF in Egypt. From there it joined Eighth Army in Tunisia, where it was preparing for the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). Operation Husky For the assault landing on 10 July 1943, all three of 12th LAA Rgt's batteries were assigned to Beach Groups in XXX Corps's sector. Beach Groups consisted of a mixture of sub-units from different Arms and Services to secure, defend and control the landing points over which the assault units would pass. Each beach group was allotted one HAA and one LAA battery, commanded by a small AA HQ in radio contact with a control ship. The AA batteries landed with a minimum scale of men and equipment. The gunners went ashore as infantry, prepared for a firefight before moving to the sites selected for gun positions.Routledge, pp. 260–2.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267. There was only light opposition to the assault on Eighth Army's front, and most of the beach groups were established at their designated gun sites or alternatives by the time the guns arrived four hours later. During the morning the Luftwaffe began attacking the beaches and shipping with high-level bombing and low-level machine-gunning, and the LAA batteries were very active. 34 Battery of 12th LAA Rgt shot down two aircraft in the morning, but the LAA gunners were hampered by the lack of early warning radar and by having unsuitable radio receivers. Over the next two days the AA HQs and the batteries' equipment came ashore, but confusion continued and there were many cases of 'friendly fire' incidents against Allied aircraft over the beaches. Eighth Army captured Catania on 5 August, and the AA units moved up behind it to defend the airfields. 12th LAA Rgt defended Catania under 73rd AA Bde, with 34 Bty detached to Comiso under 62nd AA Bde. By mid-September, when Eighth Army launched Operation Baytown to cross the Straits of Messina onto mainland Italy, 34 Bty had rejoined RHQ at Catania, while 36 Bty had been pushed forward to Messina. During the early stages of the fighting on the mainland 12th LAA Rgt remained in the area of Messina and Milazzo alongside 61st HAA Rgt under 73rd AA Bde.Routledge, Table XLIII, p. 268. By January 1944, when Sicily was merely a rear base, 12th LAA Rgt was alongside 61st HAA Rgt at Augusta, with 34 Bty detached to Palermo. Italy The regiment landed in Italy later in 1944. After the breakout from the Anzio beachhead and the capture of Rome in June, it joined 66th AA Bde supporting the advance of the US Fifth Army up the west coast to Livorno. The brigade then remained in the area between Livorno and Florence for the winter, in heavy rain, flooding and snow. The tasks were limited to the AA defence of the port of Livorno (HAA and LAA) and five airfields (LAA only). By now there was a severe frontline manpower shortage and an excess of AA units, so several regiments including 12th LAA began re-training as infantry. At one point 12th LAA formed a troop armed with US 75mm pack howitzers. In April 1945, 66th AA Bde moved on to Genoa (see above). At the end of the war 12th LAA Rgt became a holding regiment on 22 November 1945, with A to D Btys, before being placed in suspended animation at RAF Gosfield, Essex, on 14 April 1946. Postwar In 1947 both regiments were reformed in the reconstituted TA. 61st HAA Regiment became 461st (Middlesex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, with HQ at Finchley, forming part of 63 AA Bde (the former 37th AA Bde). However, when AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, the regiment was ordered into 'suspended animation'. This was soon changed to total disbandment, which was completed by July that year.Frederick, p. 1016.444-473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on 12th LAA Regiment became 512th (Finsbury Rifles) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, with its HQ at Pentonville, forming part of 52 (London) AA Bde (the former 26th (London) AA Bde. It survived the disbandment of AA Command, instead merging with 568 (St Pancras) (Mixed) LAA/Searchlight Regiment and 656 (Tower Hamlets) HAA Regiment to form 512 LAA Regiment: * P (Finsbury Rifles) Battery * Q (St Pancras) Battery * R (Tower Hamlets) Battery. The new regiment was in 33 AA Bde (the wartime 63rd AA Bde). Another round of mergers in 1961 saw P and R Batteries amalgamate with 459 (Essex Regiment) HAA Regiment and 517 LAA (formerly 7th and 5th Bns Essex Regiment respectively) to form a new 300 (Tower Hamlets) Light Air Defence Regiment, when the Finsbury Rifles lineage ended.Finsbury Rifles LAA at Regiments.org.474–519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on Insignia The 35th Middlesex RVC adopted the Rifle green uniform with red facings and black buttons of the KRRC. Despite their transfer to the RA in 1935, the regiment's personnel continued to wear their Finsbury Rifles cap badges. On formation 12th LAA Rgt chose to show its ancestral links to the Finsbury Rifles and KRRC by wearing a black KRRC button on the shoulder straps of tunics and battledress blouses. During World War II, 61st HAA Rgt bore an embroidered arm title '61 MIDDX RA' in gold on maroon, worn on the sleeve of the battledress blouse. Honorary Colonels The following served as Honorary Colonels of the Finsbury Rifles: * Col Henry Penton (1817–1882; see above) * Capt Frederick Thomas Penton, MP (1851–1929; son of Henry Penton) * William Compton, 6th Marquess of Northampton, DSO, appointed 15 December 1923 * Maj Cyril Frederick Penton (1886–1960; younger son of F.T. Penton), appointed Hon Col of 11th Londons and later 12th (Finsbury Rifles) LAA on 23 May 1935 * Sir Howard Button, appointed Hon Col of 61st (Middlesex) HAA on 27 August 1938. Prominent members * Field Marshal Lord Harding (1896–1989), commissioned as a TF 2nd Lt on 15 May 1914, transferred to the Regular Army during World War I. * Lance-Corporal John Alexander Christie (1895–1967), enlisted September 1914, won the VC in Palestine.Christie VC plaque at UK War Memorials Register. Battle Honours The Finsbury Rifles war memorial in St Mark's Myddelton Square The Finsbury Rifles were awarded the following Battle Honours (those listed in Bold Type were chosen to appear on the regimental appointments): South Africa 1900–02. World War I: Bullecourt, Ypres 1917, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Passchendaele, France and Flanders 1917–18, Suvla, Landing at Suvla, Scimitar Hill, Gallipoli 1915, Egypt 1915–17, Gaza, El Mughar, Nebi Samwil, Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tell 'Asur, Megiddo, Sharon, Palestine 1917–18. The Royal Artillery does not carry battle honours, so none were awarded to 61st HAA Rgt or 12th LAA Rgt for World War II.

It saw considerable service on the Western Front, at Salonika and in Palestine during World War I. It served as an infantry regiment during World War II before conversion to an artillery unit in 1947 and subsequent amalgamation in 1967. Background The London Regiment was created in 1908 as part of the Haldane Reforms, and consisted entirely of Territorial Force (TF) infantry battalions, with no Regular component. Its Poplar and Stepney Rifles Battalion was formed by merging two Volunteer Corps that had previously been affiliated to the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own). Their headquarters were at 66 Tredegar Road, until the drill hall was demolished in the 1960s.Osborne, Mike, 2006. Always Ready: The Drill Halls of Britain's Volunteer Forces, Partizan Press, Essex, p237 Rifle Volunteers 1859-1908 =15th Middlesex (The Customs and Docks) Rifle Volunteer Corps= Poplar & Stepney Rifles memorial plaque on a building in Wapping Wall, next to Shadwell Basin Bridge The invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). The 26th recruited from customs officers in the London docks and amalgamated with the 9th Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteers in 1864. It was renumbered 15th in 1881 and became a volunteer Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own).Army List, HMSO, 1892, p =2nd Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Corps= The unit was formed as the 1st Administrative Battalion, Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Corps, in May 1861. It was formed by the grouping of six smaller rifle volunteer corps formed in 1860. The headquarters were established at Truman's Brewery, Spitalfields. It was renumbered 2nd in 1881 and also became a volunteer Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own). In 1892 its headquarters were at 237 Whitechapel Road.Army List, HMSO, 1892, p648 Territorial Force In 1908 on the formation of the Territorial Force the 15th Middlesex and 2nd Tower Hamlets were amalgamated to form the 17th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Poplar and Stepney Rifles) (Territorial Force). First World War Men of the 17th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Poplar and Stepney Rifles), 47th (2nd London) Division, crossing a muddy area in the Ancre Valley, October 1916. (IWM Q1561) With the outbreak of war in August 1914 the Territorial Force (TF) was mobilised. The size of the TF was increased by the formation of duplicates of the pre-war units. The existing battalion became the 1/17th Battalion, and served on the Western Front from 1915-18. A duplicate 2/17th Battalion was formed in August 1914. It was briefly in France before taking part in the Macedonian and Palestinian campaigns. A 3/17th Battalion was formed in 1915. It was a reserve unit and did not serve outside the UK. Interwar period In 1926 the battalion was re-designated the 17th London Regiment (Tower Hamlets Rifles). In 1937 it became the Tower Hamlets Rifles, Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). Second World War In late May 1941 the Regiment was redesignated again to create the 9th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort’s Own). The battalion was part of the 2nd Support Group of the 2nd Armoured Division and then the 200th Guards Brigade until June 1942. The 9th later served with the 4th Armoured Brigade in the 7th Armoured Division and took part in the Battle of Gazala in May 1942 during the North African Campaign before being disbanded in August 1942.Brief History Of The British 4th Armoured Brigade The 10th Battalion was formed in 1941 by the redesignation of the 2nd Battalion, Tower Hamlets Rifles and transferred to the 26th Armoured Brigade of the 6th Armoured Division, seeing service with the division in Tunisia in 1943 before, in May 1944, transferring to the 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade, serving alongside the 2nd and 7th Battalions of the Rifle Brigade in the Italian Campaign. However, the battalion was disbanded in late March 1945, with most of the personnel being sent to the 2nd Battalion. Post War On the re- establishment of the Territorial Army in 1947 both Tower Hamlets Battalions (9th and 10th) of the Rifle Brigade were amalgamated to form 656th Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Tower Hamlets) TA, with headquarters at Bow.Norman E. H. Litchfield, The Territorial Artillery 1908–1988 (Their Lineage, Uniforms and Badges), Nottingham: Sherwood Press, 1992, p175 in 1955 it was amalgamated with the 512th (Finsbury Rifles) and 568th (St Pancras) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiments RA (TA), being reduced to 'P' Battery in the new Regiment. A further amalgamation in 1961 created 300th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (TA), subsequently re-designated 300th (Tower Hamlets) Light Air Defence Regiment RA (TA). In 1967 it was again amalgamated to form The Greater London Regiment and the Tower Hamlets lineage was lost. References Bibliography * Maj R.

Johnson (March 6, 1908 – June 18, 1969) was an American chemist and mathematician who served as President of Montana State University from 1964 to 1969. A group of historians named him one of Montana State's four most important presidents in 2011. Early life and career Leon Johnson was born March 6, 1908, in Hawley, Minnesota, to Hans L. and Petra (Solum) J. Johnson.Who Was Who in American History, Science and Technology, p. 312. He had four siblings: Brothers Harvey, Burtrum and Hans, and sister Orpha.\\"Orpha V. Anderson.\\" Dobmeier Funeral Home. October 2011. Accessed 2013-08-15. His parents were both of Norwegian descent, and he grew up speaking perfect Norwegian.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 93. He enrolled at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics in 1932. After graduating, he taught chemistry, music, and physics at high schools in Killdeer and Mandan, North Dakota. He also filled administrative roles in these schools. He left teaching high school in 1939, and took a position as an instructor in agricultural biochemistry at the University of Minnesota. He enrolled the same year in the university's doctoral program, and graduated in 1943 with a Ph.D. in biochemistry. From 1940 to 1943, he was a Frasch Foundation Research Fellow. Montana State University Johnson won an appointment as an assistant professor of chemistry and a research biochemist at what was then known as Montana State College (MSC) on September 1, 1943.\\"SWC Districts to Meet.\\" The Poplar Standard. March 19, 1965.\\"Dr. Leon H. Johnson New President of Montana State.\\" Helena Independent Record. February 10, 1964. He was promoted to full professor in 1948. In 1947, MSC President Roland Renne appointed him director of the MSC Endowment and Research Foundation. This nonprofit organization, newly established by Renne, was incorporated to allow the college to accept federal and private research grants. He continued in this position until 1967, partway into his presidency.\\"Foundation's Growth Noted.\\" Kalispell Daily InterLake. July 4, 1963. In 1955, Johnson was appointed Dean of the Graduate Division. Leon Johnson Hall at Montana State University. In 1963, Johnson was appointed Acting President of the college. MSC President Roland Renne had taken leaves of absence in order to take various positions with the U.S. federal government. Dr. Paschal Clay Gaines, a professor of chemistry, was named Acting President during Renne's absences. But Gaines fell ill in 1963, and the MSC Board of Regents asked Renne to return to duty. Renne demurred, noting that he'd been granted leave through early 1964 and to abandon his government position would show a lack of good faith. Montana Attorney General Forrest H. Anderson agreed that Renne had the right to the full amount of his leave of absence. The Board of Regents appointed Johnson the Acting President of MSC. On February 10, 1964, Johnson was appointed president of MSC. His appointment was effective either February 14 or February 16 (sources differ), and his salary set at $22,000 a year.\\"President of Montana State Dies of Apparent Heart Attack\\". Associated Press. June 19, 1969. Deeply committed to the college's research function, he pushed for MSC to be named a university—a change Renne had advocated since the early 1950s, and which the Montana state legislature approved on July 1, 1965. At that time, the school received its new name, Montana State University (MSU).Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 95-96. Bachelor's degree programs in economics, English, history, music, political science, and other disciplines were quickly established, as was the first university honors program.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 96. Johnson was a devoted admirer of the arts, and MSU's art and music programs blossomed.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, pp. 94–95. Johnson quickly worked to end the acrimonious relationship with the University of Montana, and the two schools began to present a united front to the state legislature.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 97-98. Johnson was a strong conservative—fiscally, socially, and politically. He was committed to continuing Renne's educational plan, but declined to spend money on new buildings (preferring to consolidate and renovate rather than expand).Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 98. He also continued Renne's policies largely barring from campus speakers who were not clearly in the political mainstream. Johnson's policies were largely supported by the student body and the taxpaying public. MSU practiced a policy known as in loco parentis, in which it acted as a \\"parent\\" toward the \\"children\\" attending school there. Students themselves accepted these restrictions, which included dress codes, older adult chaperones at dances, a ban on alcohol, and mandatory military training for freshmen and sophomores.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 100-105. Although many American college campuses were engulfed by student radicalism, MSU's student body was as conservative as Johnson was, however, and for many years the biggest issues on campus were ending Saturday morning classes, building student parking lots, and saving an old barn on campus.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 96, 108, 112. There were some campus protests, however. The first protest against the Vietnam War occurred in 1966 (drawing about 100 students),Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 110. two underground student newspapers briefly appeared,Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 103, 110. and some students organized clubs to debate issues of the day. There were minor faculty and student protests when Johnson attempted to prevent English professor James Myers from assigning students to read James Baldwin's novel Another Country,Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 104-105. and in the summer of 1968 a few faculty organized a symposium on the war. When about 150 students rallied in front of Montana Hall in 1969 to ask for co-ed and \\"open visitation\\" dorms (e.g., to allow men into women's dorm rooms, and vice versa), Johnson threatened to call out the city police. MSU's Bobcat Stadium saw its genesis during the Johnson years. Growing student unrest over the football team's use of decrepit Gatton Field (while the basketball team used modern Brick Breeden Fieldhouse) led to a proposal by Johnson in April 1968 to build a 16,000-seat stadium funded by student fees. The proposal failed in December 1968 after students argued that the university should concurrently build a new fitness center as well.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 111-112. (The stadium funding issue would pass in December 1969 after the university made repeated assurances it would build a fitness center first.)Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 115. =Death= Johnson suffered a severe heart attack on October 22, 1968, shortly after delivering his \\"State of the University\\" address to the student body. About May 7, 1969, he underwent coronary bypass surgery in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to repair a blocked artery in his heart. During this period, William Johnstone, a professor of education and Vice President for Administration at MSU, handled most of the governance matters concerning the university. Johnstone acted as an \\"interim president\\" in all but name, although he frequently referred matters to Johnson for his input.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 110-111. Johnson returned to Bozeman on May 22, and attended the university commencement on June 8. On June 18, he saw his physician at about 10:00 A.M. He returned home, and ate lunch at about 1:00 P.M. He suffered another heart attack at 1:30 P.M., and died immediately in the presence of his wife and a neighbor. After his death, William Johnstone was named Acting President.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 114. Personal life Leon Johnson married Esther Pauline Evenson on June 6, 1936. They had two daughters, Linda and Vance. Legacy, honors, and memberships Johnson's alma mater, Concordia College, bestowed a Doctor of Humane Letters on Johnson in 1966. In 1971, Montana State University named its new $3.75 million Life Science Building \\"Leon Johnson Hall\\" in his honor. The eight story structure was completed in 1976.\\"MSU Closes Leon Johnson Hall Because of Asbestos.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. November 5, 2010. Accessed 2013-08-15. Johnson was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Chemical Society, Sigma Xi, and Phi Kappa Phi. He was also a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and the Rotary Club. He was president of the Bozeman Rotary in 1950. In 2011, three historians who wrote a history of MSU were asked to name Montana State University's most important presidents. Pierce Mullen, Robert Rydell, and Jeffrey Safford named Johnson one of the four top presidents in the university's history. The others were James M. Hamilton, Roland Renne, and William Tietz. The three cited Johnson for his excellent relationships with state legislators, and for turning the school from a college to a university. Although Renne was the main force behind winning university designation (which occurred under Johnson), Johnson established bachelor's degree programs in economics, English, history, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology; started the MSU undergraduate honors program; expanded MSU's doctoral programs; and won federal research grants totalling $2 million. \\"Leon Johnson, he basically made us the university,\\" Mullen said.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Presidential Debate: Who Were MSU’s Most Important Presidents?\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle.

Yunkus (born November 13, 1949) is an American former basketball player, best known for his All-American college career at Georgia Tech. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, to a family of Lithuanian descent, Yunkus was a star player at Benton High School in Benton, Illinois, where he led the Rangers to a 61–2 record over his last two seasons. Though Yunkus was recruited by most top schools nationally, he chose to attend Georgia Tech, in part due to his interest in becoming an engineer. At Georgia Tech, Yunkus proved a capable highly scorer and rebounder, averaging 26.6 points and 11.4 rebounds per game for his three-year varsity career (freshmen were ineligible in his day). He received All-American honors in both his junior and senior seasons and was an Academic All-American all three seasons. For his career, Yunkus scored 2,232 points and recorded 955 rebounds. He is still the Yellow Jackets' all-time leading scorer, despite playing only three seasons. He also is the program career leader in scoring average. Following the close of his college career in 1971, Yunkus was drafted by both the ABA's Carolina Cougars and the NBA's Cincinnati Royals (third round, 38th pick overall). The Royals traded his rights to the Atlanta Hawks, but Yunkus ultimately left the team without playing a game for them. He returned home to Benton to enter the business world.

It is an acidophilic chemoorganotrophic bacterium containing menaquinone. It is gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, mesophilic, non-spore-forming, capsulated, saccharolytic and rod-shaped. It is also motile by peritrichous flagella. Its type strain is JCM 7670. They can grow between pH 3.0 and 6.0, but not at pH 6.5. They give positive results in esculin hydrolysis, β-galactosidase and catalase tests and are negative in oxidase and urease tests. They can use glucose, starch, cellobiose, maltose as a sole carbon source, but cannot use elemental sulfur and ferrous iron as an energy source. Another characteristic of this organism is the presence of high amounts of exopolysaccharides coating the cells from soil isolates. Presence of exopolysaccharides helps in increased adhesion and allow the bacterium to acquire nutrients more readily from the environment.  Ecology  A. capsulatum are widely distributed in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, though they were first isolated from acidic drainage. Studies based on rRNA genes revealed that they are present in the soils, sediments, wetlands and wastewater systems. Due to their ubiquity and abundance in various ecosystems, they play an important role in biogeochemical processes. A. capsulatum have also been reported to dominate soils rich in organic matter and are involved in microbial degradation of lignocellulosic plant biomass. They are frequent and sometimes dominant in iron-rich environments such as abandoned mines, and can play a significant role in iron-cycling.  Genome Features  A. capsulatum has a relatively small genome size of 4,127,496 base pairs and plasmids were not identified. Integrated prophages were found in the genome of A. capsulatum. and full complements of flagellar and chemotaxis genes were also identified. Single protein phylogenies from all the proteins encoded by the genome support the acidobacterial-proteobacterial relationship; moreover A. capsulatum proteins are most closely related to proteobacterial equivalents than to those from any other phylum. The genome encodes the ability to degrade a variety of sugars, amino acids, alcohols and metabolic intermediates and also can use complex substrates such as xylan, hemicelluloses, pectin, starch and chitin. A. capsulatum contains a large number of glycoside hydrolase-encoding genes and genes that encode plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, with a particularly large cluster that encodes pectin degradation. These suggest an important role for carbohydrates in nutritional pathways, as well as in desiccation resistance. The polymer degrading properties reveal acidobacteria as decomposers in the soil that potentially participate in the cycling of plant, fungal and insect derived organic matters. Studies also suggested further flexibility and novelty in their ability to metabolize carbon. Genomic evidences suggested the role of A.capsulatum in nitrogen cycling in soils and sediments by the reduction of nitrate, nitrite and possibly nitric oxide. Assimilatory nitrate reductase gene sequences are most similar to those described for the cyanobacteria.  Metabolism  A. capsulatum are facultative anaerobes,Pankratov, T. A., Kirsanova, L. A., Kaparullina, E. N., Kevbrin, V. V. and Dedysh, S. N. (2012). \\"Telmatobacter bradus gen. nov., sp. nov., a cellulolytic facultative anaerobe from subdivision 1 of the Acidobacteria, and emended description of Acidobacterium capsulatum Kishimoto et al. 1991.\\" Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 62:430–437. though they were previously described to be aerobic when they were first discovered. Later studies reported its ability to grow slowly under micro-oxic and anoxic conditions. Under reduced oxygen tension, optimum growth was observed on pectin, raffinose, rhamnose, sucrose, xylose, maltose, melibiose and galactose.whereas carboxylic acids and most alcohols were not utilised. Anaerobic growth occurred by means of fermenting sugars and polysaccharides. The product of cellulose degradation under anoxic conditions are acetate and hydrogen. Bacterial cellulose biofilm is hypothesised to be able to promote and facilitate adherence to ferric iron substrate, which can be useful to nutrient starved environments.Kammler, M., C. Schon, and K. Hantke. (1993). \\"Characterization of the ferrous iron uptake system of Escherichia coli.\\" J. Bacteriol. 175:6212–6219. A facultatively anaerobic lifestyle allows this bacterium to thrive at the oxic or anoxic interface of freshwater wetlands. There is growing evidence that A. capsulatum plays an important role in iron redox reactions. The ability to scavenge iron is critical for survival in soils. A. capsulatum contains gene that enable to take up iron from the environment, which encode a high-affinity ferrous iron transporter. Polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) enzymes are known for their roles in the synthesis of siderophores, as well as other natural products such as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, antitumor agents and anti nematodal agents. The A. capsulatum genome contains three clustered genes that encode NRPs, several genes that encode PKSs, and one hybrid NRPS-PKS gene. A.capsulatum contains gene that encode putative addiction modules, consisting of toxin and anti-toxin pairs. The addiction modules operates rapidly to inhibit the synthesis of DNA and protein in response to stress or starvation.  Plant-microbe interaction  A. capsulatum are dominant in the rhizosphere soil and abundant during plant development, and it is possibly due to changes in plant exudation. Root length, lateral root formation and root hair number were increased in plants exposed to A. capsulatum. Moreover, the root biomass increased significantly for plantlets inoculated with the bacterium. The improved root architecture, more lateral branches and higher number of root hairs assist in more efficient water and nutrient uptake in plants. increased shoot biomass was also observed. In addition, bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and growth along the root surfaces were observed in the bacterium. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. A. capsulatum is involved in soil matrix formation, water and nutrition trapping, and bacterial adhesion that lead to soil aggregate formation. The bacterium produce exopolysaccharides for adhesion to the root surfaces. A. capsulatum can has a positive effect on plant growth indirectly by acting as a biocontrol agent or directly by modulating plant hormone levels and by facilitating resource acquisition, mostly nitrogen, phosphorus and iron. A recent study tested the production of the auxin indole 3 acetic acid by the bacterium and they verified that a possible auxin production is involved in plant growth promotion.

It is part of the Z12 class of locomotives History Locomotive 1210 was built in 1878 by Beyer, Peacock & Co., Manchester, England. The locomotive arrived in Sydney and began its working life as No. 120 on the southern and western lines. After 15 years service the locomotive was transferred to Penrith and in 1896 it was transferred to the far north-west of NSW. The locomotive was returned to Sydney in 1912 and in 1914 was shifted to Goulburn, where it hauled trains to Queanbeyan. On 25 May 1914 locomotive 1210 hauled the first revenue-earning train into Canberra. This was the coal train that served the main Canberran electricity generation station. The re-classification of NSW engines gave the engine number 1210 post 1924 and worked in the Parkes and Mudgee districts. Demise and preservation In 1932 Locomotive 1210 was declared obsolete and withdrawn from service but not scrapped due to a shortage of engines and in 1935 assigned to Moree to haul local branch line trains. In 1943 the engine was again withdrawn from service but due to war- time pressure on the railways returned to service. In 1947 the engine was returned to Parkes for use as a relief or emergency engine. It continued in use until 1958 when it was finally withdrawn from service. In 1955 for the centenary of rail operations in New South Wales, with sister locomotive 1243 hauled the Vintage Train across the state for railway celebrations. 1210 and 1243 also celebrated the NSW Railway's \\"Last Steam Train to Gosford\\". On 31 October 1959 the NSW Steam Tram and Railway Preservation Society hired the locomotive to haul a train from Sydney to Canberra for the dedication of All Saints Church, Ainslie. Bruce Macdonald and the Society successfully appealed to the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) and the NSW Railways to assist in the locomotive's preservation.Department of the Interior 72/436 NSW Steam Tram & Railway Preservation Society - Preservation as a Historical Relic of 1st Locomotive to Canberra In 1962 the Locomotive left Sydney for Canberra for the formal presentation ceremony arriving at 2:50 pm on 27 January. 1210 was accepted and placed on display outside the Canberra railway station. The ARHS obtained permission to clean and polish 1210 while plinthed and subsequently relocated to the Canberra Railway Museum in 1984. The locomotive was restored to operational condition with Australian Bicentennial Authority funds and re-commissioned on 19 September 1988. At that time No 1210 was the oldest operational main line steam locomotive in the world and continues to haul heritage trains. In the early 2010s, locomotive 1210 underwent mechanical and boiler works in the hope it could be back in steam for the Centenary of Rail to Canberra in May 2014. This restoration has stalled due to the ARHS ACT Division being placed into liquidation in November 2016. Hopes to have it running by Easter 2018 were dashed following parts such as copper boiler tubes being stolen. In May 2020 it was announced by the new Canberra Railway Museum that the locomotive would be reassembled for static display only.

It was probably written in 1636. It pays homage to a play by the same name by Lope de Vega, which it surpassed in fame through its superior character development, becoming one of the most well-known plays of its time. This play has three acts that explore the power of the self-made man against the political authorities of 17th century Spanish society, and the continuous struggle between corporate and individual honor.Spain is Culture  Characters  = Major Characters = * Pedro Crespo – An old, wealthy farmer who worked hard for his wealth but is not of noble blood. He places his honor and God above everything, but his principles come into question upon his appointment to the position of mayor after he is disgraced by the rape of his daughter. * Don Lope of Figueroa – General of the troop that stopped at Zalamea. This proud general has the tendency to make extreme oaths that he does not necessarily think through. He is the symbol of the military throughout the play. * Don Alvaro of Ataide – Captain under Don Lope. He is known to be a womanizer, and abuses the hospitality of Pedro Crespo by creating commotion during his stay. Later, after the other troops leave, he stays behind and attacks Isabel, raping her. He is captured by Juan and then hanged by Pedro Crespo. * Isabel – Daughter of Pedro Crespo. She is aware of the danger the soldiers pose to her honor, and knows to uphold her virtue in order to preserve her family's honor. She is known for being very beautiful. In the end, she decides to go to a convent. * Juan – Son of Pedro Crespo. Decides to join Don Lope's regiment yet returns when he hears a damsel in distress. He injures the attacker, only to realize that it is Don Alvaro and the damsel his sister. * Rebolledo – Soldier serving under Don Alvaro. He helps Don Alvaro fake a fight in the presence of Ines in order to draw her out. He hopes to gain gambling privileges in partnership with La Chispa. However, he feels guilty for tricking the kind Ines after she helps him run from the fake fight. * La Chispa – Mistress to Rebolledo. Her name literally translates as \\"The Spark\\". She hopes to gain gambling privileges in partnership with Rebolledo. She has the reputation among the soldiers for being a whore. = Minor Characters = * Ines – Cousin of Isabel * Don Mendo – Nobleman who is very poor yet tries to maintain the illusion of wealth. He hopes to woo Isabel and marry into her family for money. * Nuño – Servant to Don Mendo * Philip II of Spain  Summary  = Act I = A group of soldiers under Don Lope of Figueroa stops in the town of Zalamea, where the captain of the troop, Don Alvaro, is housed by the wealthy farmer Pedro Crespo. Hearing about the military's plans, Pedro Crespo decides to hide his daughter and niece in the attic, knowing that when the military comes around, honors are often ruined. However, Don Alvaro arrives with the intention of seeing Isabel, for he has heard the rumors of her beauty. Housed by Pedro Crespo, Don Alvaro devises a plan to fake a fight with Rebolledo and have him run away into the attic in order to catch a glimpse at Isabel and ascertain for himself whether the rumors about her beauty are true. The plan works, although the ruckus brings the attention of the general, Don Lope of Figueroa. Don Lope decides to stay at Pedro's house, and they develop an instant dislike for each other. Don Lope brashly declares that he would hang anyone who might bring any slight harm to his men. Pedro makes the same vow for anyone who would besmirch his honor, stating that honor is the connection to the soul and thus to God. They part ways, each thinking the other overtly stubborn. = Act II = The day Alvaro marches his men out of Zalamea, he decides to leave them under the supervision of a subordinate and return for Isabel. Juan has also decided to depart and become a soldier under Don Lope's forces. Having come out of the house with her family to send her brother off, Isabel is taken by the captain; a few of his men help and prevent Pedro Crespo and Ines from helping her. Juan, having not gone far, hears the cries of anguish and returns to assist, not knowing that it is his father or sister that are being attacked. = Act III = Isabel, who has been raped by Don Alvaro, wanders around until she finds her father. She tells him what happened to her, including how her brother injured Don Alvaro. Both desire death, knowing that their honor is ruined, but Pedro brings his daughter back to town. Once there, Pedro discovers that he has been elected mayor and that King Philip II is to arrive in town the next day. He also finds out that the soldiers are still there in town trying to mend Don Alvaro's wound. Pedro, as a father, goes to Don Alvaro and begs him to marry his daughter, offering any amount of his fortune he desires as dowry. Enraged, Don Alvaro refuses. Pedro arrests Don Alvaro, deciding to take matters legally. Pedro, acting as mayor, also arrests Juan upon his return for his assault on an officer. Hearing of Don Alvaro's arrest, Don Lope returns to Zalamea prepared to storm the jail. At this moment, the King arrives. After being told the facts, the King decides that the law has been followed, but that the accused must be tried elsewhere. Pedro then reveals that justice has already taken place, opening the door to show that Don Alvaro has already been hanged. Pedro argues that it does not matter who hangs a man that is to die anyway, a logic with which the King cannot argue. Pedro is then appointed permanent mayor of Zalamea. Juan is pardoned and returns to Don Lope's army. Isabel decides to go to a convent in order to restore her honor with God.  Themes and Motifs  = Honor =  Self- made Man versus Nobleman  * Pedro Crespo remains a farmer of low blood regardless of how wealthy or virtuous he is. Pedro Crespo is not a \\"Don\\", the prefix for a nobleman. He chooses not to buy his way into the title, for everyone knows who he is already and would know how he came to the title. * Don Mendo has the title of nobility, even though he is poor and refuses to work. His title is a joke amongst the town and shows how having such a title means little anymore.  Tension Between the Civilians versus the Military  * Pedro Crespo represents the civilian. His vows are to protect the honor of the individual, for it is their only connection to God. ** Pedro also maintains the honor of justice as the mayor when he chooses to arrest both Don Alvaro and his son. ** Pedro and his children do not hesitate to die if they must in order to restore their honor with God. * Don Lope shows the honor the military has to the King. His vows are to be honored as well, although his might be more rash than that of Pedro's. ** The military has the right to be housed wherever they choose, whether the civilians agree to this or not. Civilians have no right to refuse the military, thus increasing tension when they stop in town. Adaptations The play has been turned into several films including a 1920 German silent The Mayor of Zalamea and a 1954 Spanish sound film The Mayor of Zalamea.

In 2008, the municipal government of Montreal gave BPR responsibility for overseeing aspects of the bidding process for a contract to overhaul the city's waterworks. According to an article in the Montreal Gazette, BPR was responsible for such matters as \\"writing the tender specifications for a contract, taking part in information sessions with bidders and even helping to assess the bids,\\" all of which are \\"traditionally reserved for the civil service.\\" The city's auditor-general strongly questioned the bidding process, leading to its cancellation by Montreal mayor Gérald Tremblay.Henry Aubin, \\"Same old city hall; Promises of reform appear empty, with little prospect of change,\\" Montreal Gazette, 4 February 2012, A2. Charbonneau Commission and after In March 2013, Pierre Lavallée, president of BPR Inc., testified before the Charbonneau Commission on corruption in Montreal's construction sector. He stated that his firm had tried to expand its Montreal operations in the early 2000s, but had been unable to make much progress until meeting with political fundraiser Bernard Trépanier and being told to funnel three per cent of every project they won to the Union Montreal municipal party. Lavallée testified that he found this arrangement \\"shameful and degrading\\" but had been advised by a prominent employee that his firm would not otherwise be successful. BPR allegedly agreed to the kickback scheme and funneled between $145,000 and $155,000 to the party.Monique Muise, \\"Company 'ashamed' of kickbacks, inquiry told; Agreed to pay up to $155,000 for work,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 March 2013, A7.

In August 2013, new Montreal mayor Laurent Blanchard reluctantly announced that new municipal contracts for infrastructure renewal would be awarded to BPR and SNC-Lavalin, another firm cited at the Charbonneau Commission for alleged bid-rigging. In explaining this decision, Blanchard noted that the relevant call for tenders had been issued in late 2012, a few weeks before the city adopted more stringent contracting rules; he also stated that starting the process over would result in delays and unsafe road conditions. \\"It wasn't an easy decision, but, legally, we had no choice,\\" Blanchard said. \\"We understand that Montrealers will ask 'why?'\\"Sue Montgomery, \\"Contracts go to firms linked to corruption; City taps SNC Lavalin, BPR to fix crumbling infrastructure despite previous bid-rigging,\\" Montreal Gazette, 8 August 2013, A6.

The eggs are produced by the female in a pair of ovaries. Sperm, produced by the male in one testis or more commonly two, is transmitted to the female during mating by means of external genitalia. The sperm is stored within the female in one or more spermathecae. At the time of fertilization, the eggs travel along oviducts to be fertilized by the sperm and are then expelled from the body (\\"laid\\"), in most cases via an ovipositor. Internal =Female= genitalia of Lepidoptera Female insects are able to make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Their reproductive systems are made up of a pair of ovaries, accessory glands, one or more spermathecae, and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries make eggs and accessory glands produce the substances to help package and lay the eggs. Spermathecae store sperm for varying periods of time and, along with portions of the oviducts, can control sperm use. The ducts and spermathecae are lined with a cuticle. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make varies according to the number of ovarioles, with the rate at which eggs develop being also influenced by ovariole design. In meroistic ovaries, the eggs-to-be divide repeatedly and most of the daughter cells become helper cells for a single oocyte in the cluster. In panoistic ovaries, each egg-to-be produced by stem germ cells develops into an oocyte; there are no helper cells from the germ line. Production of eggs by panoistic ovaries tends to be slower than that by meroistic ovaries. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport, and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized. Paternity testing of insects has revealed that some, and probably many, female insects use the spermatheca and various ducts to control or bias sperm used in favor of some males over others. =Male= Male genitalia of Lepidoptera The main component of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis. External Variety of male structures in Phlebotominae (Diptera, Psychodidae) The ground plan of the abdomen of an adult insect typically consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum, sternum, and perhaps a pleurite. Terga are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by a membrane. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen. Generally, the first seven abdominal segments of adults (the pregenital segments) are similar in structure and lack appendages. However, apterygotes (bristletails and silverfish) and many immature aquatic insects have abdominal appendages. Apterygotes possess a pair of styles; rudimentary appendages that are serially homologous with the distal part of the thoracic legs. And, mesally, one or two pairs of protrusible (or exsertile) vesicles on at least some abdominal segments. These vesicles are derived from the coxal and trochanteral endites (inner annulated lobes) of the ancestral abdominal appendages. Aquatic larvae and nymphs may have gills laterally on some to most abdominal segments. Of the rest of the abdominal segments consist of the reproductive and anal parts. The anal-genital part of the abdomen, known as the terminalia, consists generally of segments 8 or 9 to the abdominal apex. Segments 8 and 9 bear the genitalia; segment 10 is visible as a complete segment in many \\"lower\\" insects but always lacks appendages; and the small segment 11 is represented by a dorsal epiproct and pair of ventral paraprocts derived from the sternum. A pair of appendages, the cerci, articulates laterally on segment 11; typically these are annulated and filamentous but have been modified (e.g. the forceps of earwigs) or reduced in different insect orders. An annulated caudal filament, the median appendix dorsalis, arises from the tip of the epiproct in apterygotes, most mayflies (Ephemeroptera), and a few fossil insects. A similar structure in nymphal stoneflies (Plecoptera) is of uncertain homology. These terminal abdominal segments have excretory and sensory functions in all insects, but in adults there is an additional reproductive function. =Genitalia= The organs concerned specifically with mating and the deposition of eggs are known collectively as the external genitalia, although they may be largely internal. Insect genitalia, especially male genitalia, is often directionally asymmetrical, and this trait has evolved multiple times in various orders. The components of the external genitalia of insects are very diverse in form and often have considerable taxonomic value, particularly among species that appear structurally similar in other respects. The male external genitalia have been used widely to aid in distinguishing species, whereas the female external genitalia may be simpler and less varied. The terminalia of adult female insects include internal structures for receiving the male copulatory organ and his spermatozoa, and external structures used for oviposition (egg- laying). Most female insects have an egg-laying tube, or ovipositor; it is absent in termites, parasitic lice, many Plecoptera, and most Ephemeroptera. Ovipositors take two forms: # true, or appendicular, formed from appendages of abdominal segments 8 and 9; # substitutional, composed of extensible posterior abdominal segments.

Over the course of his career his body of work has also extended into the mediums of drawing, painting and works on paper. Benwell trained as an artist in Melbourne, Australia. He received a Diploma of Art from the Victorian College of the Arts in 1974. He went onto attain a Diploma of Education from Melbourne State College in 1976 where he studied ceramics under Professor Noel John Flood. In 2005 he completed his formal education with a Masters of Fine Arts from Monash University. Art Practice Through the medium of ceramics Stephen Benwell seeks to challenge local and international pottery traditions and art-craft context. He achieves this through transcending the boundaries between traditional standards of painting, drawing and sculpture, he stating: \\"I moved sideways into craft and pottery as a way to find a surface, a form, that I could put my painting onto”. Aesthetically, his work marries studio-based investigations of the ceramicist with the painterly and sculptural concerns of the contemporary artist that manifests in how he couples high art with low art or low culture. Exhibitions and Collections Stephen Benwell has exhibited consistently since 1975. His work has been exhibited in over 30 solo and over 60 group shows. He exhibits regularly at Niagara Galleries in Melbourne, as well as throughout Australia and overseas in both commercial and public galleries. His work has exhibited as part of Australian Contemporary at SOFA Art & Design, in Chicago, Craft from Scratch: 8th Triennale (Australia and Germany) at the Museum of Applied Art, Frankfurt, Australian Glass and Ceramic Art at Galerie Ursula Rosenhauer in Germany, and A Secret History of Blue and White, which travelled throughout Asia between 2006 and 2009 through funding from Asialink. In 2013 Benwell’s ceramic work from 1970 and onwards was exhibited in a major retrospective entitled Stephen Benwell: Beauty, Anarchy, Desire – A Retrospective at Heide Museum of Modern Art.

The branch served the Union Stock Yards and the Canaryville neighborhood of Chicago and consisted of eight elevated stations. It opened on April 8, 1908, and closed on October 6, 1957. Operations The Stock Yards branch was a elevated line which served eight stations. The branch began at the station, which was a transfer point for the South Side Elevated and Kenwood branch. It ran westward along two tracks to the station, before making a counterclockwise loop, serving the Union Stock Yards with stops at the Morris & Company packing plant at Racine Avenue, the Swift & Company packing plant, Packers Avenue, and the Armour and Company plant. History The Stock Yards branch had its origins in the Union Stock Yards and Transit Company, a freight line built in 1864, which paralleled 40th Street between the Union Stock Yards and the Illinois Central Railroad. The freight line began passenger service in 1882. Passenger service along the line from the Stock Yards to Kenwood continued until 1904, and from the Stock Yards to the LaSalle Street Station downtown until 1908. In 1903, the Chicago City Council passed a measure requiring the 40th Street line be elevated as part of a larger effort to remove grade crossings from Chicago railroads; this meant that the South Side Elevated Railroad took over all operations from the Illinois Central, while the Chicago Junction Railroad owned the land and the structures. The Stock Yards \\"L\\" branch opened on April 8, 1908; not only was it a popular line for workers, but also for tourists. In many ways, the line rose and fell with the fortunes of the Union Stock Yards. 50,000 workers worked in the yards, providing ample ridership for the branch. Conditions were extremely poor, and a 1934 fire in the Yard caused the shutdown of the line west of Halsted for 6 months while insurance disputes between the meat packers, the Junction Railroad and the Chicago Rapid Transit Company delayed repairs. While the Union Stock Yards had been gradually declining before the Great Depression, the post-World War II era would lead to the Stock Yards and, by extension, the line's rapid decline. The Chicago Rapid Transit Company declared bankruptcy in 1947 and was taken over by the Chicago Transit Authority, which streamlined operations and cut unprofitable and stations routes out of the system; the rise of interstate trucking, refrigerated box cars, along with expensive property values in urban areas were slowly killing the Stock Yards; the line was extremely outdated (one of the last Elevated lines to use wooden cars from the early days of the \\"L\\") and sat on property and right of way loaned from the Junction Railroad, whose rental costs often exceeded revenue. The Wallace station was the first to close on May 3, 1952. In 1956, another fire damaged Packers station; the loop was repaired a year later in April, however it was for naught as all service on the branch closed on October 6, 1957 due to extreme losses and declining ridership. The CTA replaced the elevated train with the #43 bus line, which followed the same route into the Stock Yards; in a way, the line (at least the service and routing) would survive beyond the Stock Yards itself when the Yards closed in 1971, as the New City neighborhood went up on the former grounds of the now- demolished Stock Yards. As with most of the structures that once existed in the Yards, there is no remaining structural evidence of the line's existence.

Designated a Champaign Landmark on July 18, 2005, the ornate decoration, art deco architecture, and copper roof distinguish the building as one of the most recognizable in downtown Champaign. The main inspiration for the building's art deco design was Los Angeles City Hall. History Land for the original City Hall was donated to the city of Champaign in 1888 by David Bailey, who was a charter founder of the First National Bank of Champaign. It is believed that he donated the land due to the lot's odd shape, and his inability to develop the land. Bailey also insisted that the city must develop a building worth no less than $5,000 within a year of his donation. The city, in turn, built a multi-purpose structure that housed the Police and Fire Departments, an auditorium, a library, and a chamber and meeting room for the City Council. Within almost 40 years, the building was in such poor condition that the City Council voted to demolish the multi-purpose building and in its place the current City Building was constructed from 1935-1937.

Hadacidin is the simplest known naturally occurring hydroxamic acid. The hydroxylamino group is frequently donated by a hydroxylamino acid such as 8-N-hydroxyornithine of the siderochromes. This compound, first isolated and characterized by Kaczka et al. in 1962,Kaczka, E. A., Gitterman, C. O., Dulaney, E. L., and Folkers, K. (1962), Biochemistry 1, 340. seemed well suited for a study of the route of hydroxamic acid biosynthesis. The hydroxamate bond may be considered to be a peptide bond with an oxygen atom on the amide nitrogen, but there is no a priori reason to decide whether the oxygen atom is introduced before or after the formation of the amide bond. In the latter case, formylglycine would be an intermediate in hadacidin biosynthesis. N-Hydroxylation of an amide bond was reported by Cramer et al. (1960), who found that N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene was formed in the intact rat upon administration of 2-acetylaminofluorene. Nevertheless, this finding cannot be considered direct proof of N-hydroxylation of an amide bond because, as the authors point out, the acetyl group is labile in their experiments, and hydroxylation of the amino group might have occurred. Glycine, formate, and the 2-carbon of serine were all found to be very quickly incorporated into hadacidin during its synthesis by Penicillium aurantioviolaceum. The experiment showed that C-1 of glycine was found almost exclusively in the glycyl portion of hadacidin while formate, the 3-carbon of serine, and the 2-carbon of glycine were incorporated into both the glycyl and formyl portions of the hydroxamate. N-Hydroxyglycine was incorporated into hadacidin at a rate equal to that for glycine in 3-hr periods and to a much greater extent in longer time periods. N-Hydroxyglycine, but not glycine, brought about a net stimulation of hydroxamate production. Nitroacetic acid, glyoxylic acid oxime, and formylglycine were not rapidly incorporated into hadacidin. Experiments showed that the hydroxylamino oxygen atom of hadacidin is derived from oxygen gas rather than water. The experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis that the biosynthesis of hadacidin occurs by N-oxygenation of glycine to yield N-hydroxyglycine followed by N-formylation to yield the hydroxamate.Baker, J.

History What is now Huashan 1914 Creative Park opened in 1916 as Taihoku Winery during Japanese rule. It was privately owned winery that produced sake and ginseng wines, and bred moth orchids. In 1922, the government included wine within a list of monopoly items. They bought the winery and changed the name to Taiwan Governor-General's Monopoly Bureau, Taihoku Wine Factory. The winery then produced rice wine and liquors. In 1945, the ROC Government took ownership over the winery and changed the name into Taiwan Province Monopoly Bureau, Taipei Wine Factory. In 1949, when the Monopoly Bureau started including tobacco among its items, the winery was renamed to Taiwan Province Tobacco and Wine Government Monopoly Bureau, Taipei First Winery. The winery produced cheap liquor made from cassava that became known as Taibai Liquor. It was a staple drink for most people. In the mid-1960s, the winery name was changed yet again, this time to Fruit Wine Factory. Rice wine started to occupy a bigger part of its production. In compliance with government policy, the winery started to develop fruit wines. It was the start of its golden age. In 1987, due to rapid urbanization in Taipei, pollution it caused due to manufacturing process and skyrocketing land prices, the winery moved to Linkou District in Taipei County. In 1997, the Golden Bough Theater Group barged into the winery premises and staged a production. The winery was slated for demolition. The group was charged with forcible entry into state property. Artists and performing groups reacted and clamored for the reopening of the winery that had been left idle for ten years. In December 2003, the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) took over its management. They planned a complete reconstruction that started in early 2004. And the end of 2005, Huashan 1914 Creative Park opened and offered artists a place to develop their creations and non-profit organizations a venue to hold activities. In November 2007, the CCA signed a contract with Taiwan Cultural-Creative Development Co., Ltd. to run the park. Since then, theater groups, painters, wood sculptors, writers, movie producers and directors from Taiwan and abroad have found in the park a timeless pace to showcase their creative talents.

Their exploits are known in part through the fictional film Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981), directed by Lamont Johnson and starring Amanda Plummer in her film debut as Cattle Annie, with Diane Lane as Little Britches. Cattle Annie and Little Britches were crack shots with both pistol and rifle, but today they are mostly unknown outside of the film. Yet they were once among the most recognized names among outlaws in the Oklahoma and Indian territories, where they carried out their short-lived criminal ventures. Embracing the criminal element Anna was born in Lawrence in Douglas County in eastern Kansas, one of eight children of James C. and Rebekah McDoulet. When Anna was four years old, the family moved to Coyville in Wilson County, in southeastern Kansas. Anna worked as a hotel dishwasher and performed other odd jobs. When she was twelve, the family moved to the Osage Reservation near Skiatook north of Tulsa in the northern Oklahoma Territory, where she turned outlaw. Annie and Little Britches followed tales of the Bill Doolin gang from reading dime novelists like Ned Buntline, who became famous for his mostly fictional account of Buffalo Bill Cody as a western frontier hero and showman. For two years, Cattle Annie and Little Britches roamed the former Indian Territory, often working together and at other times alone. They stole horses, sold alcohol to the Osage and Pawnee Indians, and warned outlaw gangs whenever law-enforcement officers were nearby. They wore men's clothing and packed pistols on their hips. Their adventures netted headlines from Guthrie, the capital of the former Oklahoma Territory, to Coffeyville in southeastern Kansas, where the Dalton gang attempted to rob two banks simultaneously on October 5, 1892. U.S. Marshal Steve Burke captured 13-year-old Cattle Annie climbing from a window in 1895. (Marshal Bill Tilghman had a more difficult task apprehending Little Britches, who engaged in a physical confrontation with the famous lawman before he took her into custody.) Annie was sentenced to one year in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Framingham. Because of health issues, she was soon paroled. She remained in Framingham for some time, having informed corrections officers that, if she returned to Oklahoma, she would likely have fallen back into her criminal ways. In 1898, she was working as a housekeeper for Mrs. Mary Daniels in Sherborn in Middlesex County south of Framingham. A few months later, she may have moved to New York City, where she may have died of tuberculosis. Another scenario Another legitimate report claims that Annie left Framingham to return to Oklahoma where she wed Earl Frost of Perry on March 13, 1901. The couple had two sons, Robert C. Frost (1903-1993) of Oklahoma City and Carlos D. Frost, later of Malibu, California. The Frosts divorced in Noble County, Oklahoma in October 1909, probably because Annie had joined a Wild West show. The historical museum in Guthrie maintains that, soon after the divorce from Frost, Annie married Whitmore R. Roach (1879-1947), a Texas native, veteran of World War I, and painting contractor in Oklahoma City, where they lived after 1912. They had resided from 1910 to 1912 in Fort Worth, Texas. This \\"Emma McDoulet Roach\\" is interred at Rose Hill Burial Park in Oklahoma City. She died in 1978, just short of her 96th birthday. Her newspaper obituary makes no mention of her early days or even the first name \\"Anna\\" but instead refers to \\"Emma\\", the shortened form of \\"Emmaline\\". The obituary indicates that she had been a bookkeeper in her later working career. Her services were held in her home church, Olivet Baptist in Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, Little Britches also served a short sentence at the reformatory in Framingham, but her whereabouts thereafter are unknown. Some reports indicate that Little Britches returned to Tulsa, where she was married, had a family, and led an exemplary life.Coincidentally, Annie's daughter-in-law, Esther Mae Frost (1907-1983), the wife of Robert C. Frost, had the maiden name of \\"Plummer\\", the last name of the actress who played Annie in the film. In popular culture =Film= Johnson's film, Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981), features Burt Lancaster as an historically inaccurate and much older Bill Doolin, Amanda Plummer as Cattle Annie, Rod Steiger as Marshal William Tilghman, Scott Glenn as Bill Dalton, and Buck Taylor, particularly known to audiences as the blacksmith-turned-deputy Newly O'Brien on CBS's Gunsmoke, as the outlaw Dynamite Dick, presumably Dan Clifton, called \\"Dynamite Dan.\\" =Print= Novelist Robert Ward, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, penned Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1977), his personal interpretation of the romantic legends of the Doolin-Dalton gang.

An Archaeological Survey of Southwestern Ohio. Columbus: Ohio Historical Society, 1970, 15.) is an earthworks complex in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Named for its location near the stream known as Cowan Creek, the enclosure is an important archaeological site, and it is protected as part of a state park. The Cowan Creek Circular Enclosure is not easily visible to the average observer on the ground. A survey conducted in 1949 observed that the enclosure was approximately wide, but even at that time, it had virtually no height; the only practical method of observing the site's extent was via aerial photography. Most of what is known of the site is derived from a related site not far away from the enclosure. The latter site, known as the \\"Cowan Creek Mound\\", was excavated in 1949; archaeological work revealed that the mound had been constructed circa AD 500, near the end of the period during which the Adena culture inhabited the region.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 148. This mound was part of a substantially larger group: more than twenty burial mounds were located along Cowan Creek near the enclosure, but little is known about most of them: by the time that Raymond Baby was leading the Cowan Creek Mound excavation, a dam on the creek had been completed, and the water levels of a reservoir covered the mounds before most could be investigated. The entire group remains beneath the surface of Cowan Lake to the present day, except for the enclosure.Reichling, Kevin L. \\"Cowan Lake State Park Natural Resource Management Plan\\". Columbus: Ohio Department of Natural Resources, 2009, 11. Accessed 2013-08-15. Today, the Circular Enclosure lies near the shore of Cowan Lake; the underwater site of the Cowan Creek Mound is only about away, and the enclosure lies in the middle of a peninsula in the lake. The site is now located within Cowan Lake State Park, slightly less than south of the present State Route 730. Officials have sought to allow the site and surrounding lands to return to the condition in which they existed before the region was settled. As a result, the site has never been subjected to intensive professional testing; archaeologists accordingly are unaware of whether any additional sites, such as a village location, might be nearby. In 1974, the Cowan Creek Circular Enclosure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its value as an archaeological site. Four other Clinton County archaeological sites are listed on the Register: the Beam Farm Woodland Archaeological District, and the Hillside Haven, Hurley, and Keiter Mounds.

He was the founder of the religious congregations of the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate, as well as the Sisters of Saint Joseph. He was recognized as a servant of God.  Biography  He was born in Podbuż, in east Galicia, which was part of the Austrian Empire. He came from the Polish aristocratic Sielecki family. His father, Michał, was a teacher, and his mother, Joanna, took care of the children. Starting in 1843, the family lived in Sambor, where Cyril graduated from elementary school and middle school and completed high school. He then joined the General Seminary in Lwów and thus began to study theology at Lviv University. After three years of residence in Lwów he then continued at the seminary in Przemyśl. After graduating from the seminary, he married Emilia, daughter of Mikołaj Iwasiwki, a Greek Catholic priest. After six years of marriage, she died, leaving her husband with two daughters. One died shortly after a serious illness, and the younger one grew up in the care of the Basilian sisters in Jaworów. On 8 January 1860, he was ordained to the priesthood under the ministry of the bishop of Przemyśl, Grzegorz Jachimowicz. For 14 years, he worked at the parish and lived very modestly. He was vicar and administrator for the communities of Stara Sól, Bilicz, Milków, Lubaczów and Jaworów. In 1874, he became pastor of the villages Żużel and Ceblów. In both parishes, he devoted his life to the improvement of the social conditions. He was also in contact with blessed Josaphata Hordashevska. As pastor, he began his activities with the renewal of religious life entrusted to his parishioners. He completed the construction of the church in Żużel, and improved on the church in Ceblów. His activities were recognized by Bishop Konstantyn de Czechowicz during a canonical visitation of the parish in Żużel and Ceblów in 1905. He was actively involved in the campaign against the scourge of alcoholism in the countryside, a concern of both the Roman and Greek Catholic churches. In cooperation with the local intelligence he organized sobriety help groups. He also tried to raise the local level of education. To improve the financial situation of the parish, he founded a society whose members committed themselves to helping widows, orphans and forgotten people in the parish. He also founded what is considered one of the first orphanages in Galicia. In his social activities he also worked closely with the local Polish nobility. He was particularly strongly associated with Count Stanisław Antoni Potocki, whom he met as a priest in Milków. Potocki had a farm in Oleszyce and together with Sielecki tried to eliminate illiteracy and alcoholism in the region. In her memoirs, Countess Anna Potocka called him a friend of the family.\\"Drugim przyjacielem od serca mego Męża był ksiądz Cyryl Sielecki\\", in , p. 175. 1927. In 1892, he co-founded the religious congregations of the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate, as well as later on the Sisters of Saint Joseph to promote good deeds. The last 10 years of his life were devoted to the new congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In honour of his various religious and social activities, he was awarded the title of Papal chamberlain, which was one of the highest honours that could be bestowed by the Pope, and was often given to members of noble families. For distinguished services he was made a knight of the Austrian Order of Franz Joseph in 1910. He died, age 82, at Żużel and was officially declared a servant of God.

Kelley is from Ormond Beach, Florida, and enjoyed playing sports and music growing up. He moved to Nashville to go to school and play baseball at Belmont University, where he met Tyler Hubbard, the other member of Florida Georgia Line. Early life Kelley was born on August 26, 1985 in Ormond Beach, Florida, and is the son of Ed and Mary Margaret Kelley. Growing up, Kelley enjoyed sports and writing and spent most of his time playing baseball or at the beach. As he got older he started to spend more time writing music and leading worship at his church. He also developed a strong love for playing guitar. When he was in his teens, his sister began to introduce him to country artists by playing him tapes on the way to the beach in exchange for Kelley washing her car. By the time Kelley was ready to graduate from Seabreeze High School in 2004, he was splitting his time between baseball (playing college baseball at Florida State University and being scouted by the pros) and writing music. Kelley found out late that he would be drafted by the Miami Marlins and would more than likely pursue pro baseball as a career. However, when he was doing more bench sitting than playing, he filled the void with writing. He later decided to move to Belmont University. Career =Florida Georgia Line (2010–present)= Kelley was introduced to Tyler Hubbard at Belmont University in 2007 while they were in a campus worship group together. The two became great friends, and began playing guitar and writing songs together. The two friends began playing writers rounds throughout Nashville. In 2009, the duo decided they wanted to pursue music as a career so they started playing shows throughout the south. In 2010, they independently recorded and digitally distributed their first EP, Anything Like Me. After releasing that EP, they were discovered at a county fair by Nickelback's producer, Joey Moi. After writing and polishing songs for two years, the duo released their second EP It'z Just What We Do in 2012. Major labels became interested in the duo when their debut single, \\"Cruise\\", first hit satellite radio on \\"The Highway\\" channel and began selling well on iTunes, leading to a record deal with Republic Nashville and Big Machine Label Group. In the fall of 2011, Kelley signed a publishing deal with Big Loud Shirt. The duo released their first studio album, Here's to the Good Times, on December 4, 2012 with Republic Nashville. This album was the sixth best selling album of 2013.http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6281327/florida-georgia-line- billboard-cover-story \\"Cruise\\", the first single on the album, reached number 1 on the Country Airplay chart dated December 15, 2012. A remix of \\"Cruise\\" featuring Nelly later hit number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Development history The first Voisin Type VI entered service in 1916 and replaced the Voisin III on the production lines. However, the Voisin (as they were referred to at the Western Front) Salmson engines were held in low regard by their crews. Despite the more powerful engine, the Voisin Type VIs' payload was only marginally better and the maximum speed was only - not enough of an improvement to make a difference, while climb rate suffered substantially. A single Voisin Type VI was fitted with a second Salmson in the nose of the fuselage, driving a tractor propeller. It is believed that the intention was to test a possible twin pusher and tractor propellor configuration for a new bomber planned by Voisin. Operational use Approximately 50 Voisin Type VIs were built, and these served alongside the Voisin Type IIIs in front-line escadrilles during 1916.

The Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes form the general statutory law. Sources Title page of the 1853 Laws of Pennsylvania The Constitution of Pennsylvania is the foremost source of state law. Legislation is enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, published in the Laws of Pennsylvania, and codified in the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. State agency regulations (sometimes called administrative law) are published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and codified in the Pennsylvania Code. Pennsylvania's legal system is based on common law, which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court, Superior Court, and Commonwealth Court, which are published in the Pennsylvania State Reports and the Pennsylvania Reporter. Municipalities may also promulgate local ordinances. In addition, there are also several sources of persuasive authority, which are not binding authority but are useful to lawyers and judges insofar as they help to clarify the current state of the law. =Constitution= The organic source of state law is the Constitution of Pennsylvania. Although the original Constitution of Pennsylvania was ratified in 1776, more than ten years before the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Pennsylvania, like all state constitutions, is subordinate to the federal constitution, which by its own terms is the supreme law of the land. =Legislation= Pursuant to the state constitution, the Pennsylvania General Assembly has enacted various laws, known as \\"slip laws\\". These are published in the official Laws of Pennsylvania, also known as the \\"Pamphlet Laws\\" or generically as \\"session laws\\". Pennsylvania is currently undertaking its first official codification process in the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. They are published by the Pennsylvania Legislative Reference Bureau (PALRB or LRB). There are also several unofficial sources for statutes. The old, unofficial codification is Purdon's Pennsylvania Statutes, which is also being updated in line with the new codification as Purdon's Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes Annotated. In addition, there are several historic sources of session laws. The Pennsylvania Statutes at Large contain charters, laws in force and obsolete laws from 1682 through 1809; publication began in 1896 and are being digitized by the LRB. Smith's Laws contain public laws in force from 1700 through 1829, and were published prior to the Statutes at Large, beginning in 1810. =Regulations= Front page of volume 45 of the Pennsylvania Bulletin Pursuant to certain statutes, state agencies have promulgated bodies of regulations (sometimes called administrative law). The regulations are codified in the Pennsylvania Code (Pa. Code). The Pennsylvania Bulletin is the weekly gazette containing proposed, enacted and emergency rules and other notices and important documents. Changes in the Pennsylvania Code are made via the Pennsylvania Code Reporter, a monthly loose-leaf supplement. They are compiled, edited and supplemented by the Pennsylvania Legislative Reference Bureau. =Case law= The legal system of Pennsylvania is based on the common law of England, and Pennsylvania has a reception statute providing for the \\"reception\\" of English law. All statutes, regulations, and ordinances are subject to judicial review. Pursuant to common law tradition, the courts of Pennsylvania have developed a large body of case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court, Superior Court, and Commonwealth Court. Judicial judgment of debt, Greene County, Pennsylvania, 1815 The official reporter for the Supreme Court is the Pennsylvania State Reports since 1845. There are no official reporters for either the Superior Court or the Commonwealth Court, but the Pennsylvania Reporter (a Pennsylvania-specific version of the Atlantic Reporter) is an unofficial reporter. There is no official reporting of decisions of trial courts, but County Court (Common Pleas Court) opinions are selectively published in the Pennsylvania District and County Reports (Pa. D.&C.;). Many counties also publish their own reporters which contain select trial court opinions for that county. Estate and trusts trial cases are published in the Fiduciary Reporter, and local government cases (both trial and appellate) are published in Chrostwaite's Pennsylvania Municipal Law Reporter. The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts also posts opinions from the Supreme Court (from November 1996), Superior Court (from December 1997), and Commonwealth Court (from January 1997) on its website. Superior Court opinions were published in the Pennsylvania Superior Court Reports from 1895–1997, and Commonwealth Court opinions were published in the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court Reports from 1970–1995. =Local ordinances= Title page of the 2001 Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances Municipalities may enact and enforce local ordinances.
