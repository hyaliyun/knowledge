The treaty included a commitment on the part of the Venetians to help the empire in its campaign against the Slavic tribes. In return, it guaranteed Venice's neutrality as well as its security from the mainland. However, the treaty did not end the Slavic plunderings since by 846, the Slavs were still recorded menacing cities such as the fortress of Carolea. This underscored the way the pact was more symbolic because it merely reiterated the agreements that had been already made in the past between the two empires. It concerned the rights of land use and administration of justice. It is also a valuable document that allows to know precisely the territory of the ancient Venetian ducat. The boundaries thus coincided with the old limit of the lagoons (the most extensive of currents), and the mainland reached even the Abbey of St. Hilary and the area of the ancient Altinum.

He performed in the United Kingdom and internationally (including in Israel, Singapore, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and other countries). He was a pioneer of one- to-one performance, in which an artist repeats and adapts a score for a performance for a single audience member, or audience-participant, and repeats the action serially across a run of several days. The process and outcomes in Howells' signature works were frequently modelled on activities associated with the service industries or the tertiary sector of the economy, such as washing the audience-participant's hair or clothes, or giving an audience- member a bath, replicating in some ways the labour of a hairdresser, laundry worker, or caregiver; or he appropriated and adapted intimate interpersonal experiences in carefully mediated situations, like talking around a script or score in a setting such as a Japanese rock garden in The Garden of Adrian (2009), or holding hands, listening to music, and spooning in silence in Held (2008). Life and work Howells was born in 1962 in his grandmother's house in Bapchild, Kent in the South of England. He was raised in nearby Sittingbourne, and attended Minterne County Junior School and Borden Grammar School. Workshop info page (2011). Harbourfront Centre, Toronto In the 1970s, he participated in youth theatre companies including Kent County Youth Theatre and Sittingbourne Youth Theatre.Roberts, B. (1979). ‚ÄòThe Drama Dream that Came True‚Äô, Gazette and Times From 1981-84 he attended Bretton Hall College in West Yorkshire, graduating with a bachelor's degree in Drama and English. After working as a jobbing actor and director in provincial productions of plays and pantomimes, in 1990 Howells joined the Citizens Theatre Company in Glasgow, Scotland as an assistant director to Giles Havergal (one of the company's three pioneering directors, alongside Philip Prowse and the late Robert David MacDonald). Gardner, L. (2014). 'Adrian Howells Obituary', Guardian While working at the Citizens Theatre, Howells met Stewart Laing, and Laing cast Howells alongside the drag performers Leigh Bowery and Ivan Cartwright in a production of Copi's scatological play The Homosexual or the Difficulty of Sexpressing Oneself (1971) -- Laing's first directorial production (co- directed with Gerrard McArthur). The play toured to Glasgow, London and Manchester in 1993-94. Howells recalled that 'Time Out described it as a hymn to tastelessness. I blacked up and was an Asian transsexual with a Carry on up the Khyber accent.‚Äô Wojtas, O.

(1997). Leigh Bowery: The Life and Times of an Icon. Hodder & Stoughton. p. 208 From 2001 until around 2008, much of Howells‚Äô work involved the use of a drag persona, namely Adrienne. Adrienne was used as a persona in a broad range of performances, including one-to-ones where Howells: washed and dried a punter's clothing over the course of an hour (Adrienne's Dirty Laundry Experience, 2003);, McMillan, J.

In a review, Howells described his investment in intimate participatory performance: 'I went into one-on-one work because I wanted an equal exchange between performer and audience. I wanted to really connect with an individual and make it something cherish-able and genuine. And there are moments when you puncture the performance and it is something real.‚Äô, Fielder, M. (2011). 'Adrian Howells brings May I Have the Pleasure to 2011 Edinburgh Festival', The List Later, Howells recalls, ‚ÄòI made a conscientious decision to dispense with the mask of Adrienne ‚Äì the makeup, hair, and costume.

(2014). 'Adrian Howells: He created performances of courageous honesty', Guardian After dropping the 'mask of Adrienne', Howells created one-to-one performances without a discernible persona. Key examples included The Garden of Adrian (2009); The Pleasure of Being: Washing/Feeding/Holding (2010), in which an audience-participant lay in a bath of water and oils and was washed by Howells, then‚Äîafter leaving the bath‚Äîwas fed chocolates and held while wrapped in a towel; and his most extensively toured of these performances, Foot Washing for the Sole (2008), a long encounter modelled on a foot massage. In his final years, Howells returned to creating solo and ensemble productions with larger audiences. These included Lifeguard (2012), staged in a swimming pool in Glasgow with a professional dancer who performed in the water., Brown, M. (2012). 'Review - Lifeguard, Govanhill Baths, Glasgow', The Telegraph May I Have the Pleasure...? used the format of a wedding reception to explore loneliness, sex and marriage. A reviewer wrote: 'The premise is a simple one: Howells has been best man on no fewer than eight occasions; he is something of a wedding expert, and yet he has never been in a long term relationship. This new piece meditates on the feelings of isolation which such a situation can create.', Twite, C. (2011). 'Review - May I Have The Pleasure‚Ä¶?, Traverse Theatre', Exeunt Howells struggled with chronic depression throughout his adult life. He frequently discussed depression in his performances (for example, in Adrienne: The Great Depression), and in interviews.

The text is carved in the form of a spiral on the front of one of the pews for the congregation, creating possibly the earliest known shape poem in the German language. The carving is one of several decorative designs on the pews in the church, and was created in 1510 by the master carpenter Erhart Falckener.  History  The pews, including the spiral of justice, were commissioned by the former minister of Kiedrich, Zweifuss, who also went by the Latin name . The artist was Erhart Falckener, a master carpenter, who made the relief carving in late Gothic style in 1510. He created a spiral of text surrounded by flower ornaments of acanthus (left) and thistle (right). The tendrils are stylized and include a caricature in the form of a human face in profile, just above and to the right of the last letter of the word \\"\\" (lost). The church and its late Gothic interior have remained intact over the centuries, a very rare case.  Text  The text is carved in German in capital letters, creating in a spiral read from the centre outwards. The height of the letters is at the centre, growing to at the edges. The original German text, and two possible translations into modern English, read:  Analysis  The northern aisle of the church. The church contains other decorative carvings. Unlike other more traditional ribbons and text inscriptions by Falckener, this text can be read as a call for social justice and religious integrity during the time of the Reformation, a few years before the Palatine Peasants' War of 1525. The content of the text recalls the struggle of the virtues and vices described by the early Christian poet Prudentius in his work Psychomachia. This theme was widespread in the 15th and 16th century in a simple German language formulation of the ', especially in a printed version from 1476. The topic of the spiral, an outcry for justice (\\"\\") is the theme of a 2015‚Äì2016 exposition planned in Mainz about life at the mid-Rhine at the wake of the Reformation (\\"\\").

In a sequence similar to the Resurrection, Godbody returns to life and departs once more, having encouraged the townsfolk to love one another.

The paper-calendar depicts the Andersson family's house, and characters from the series. The background also shows the mental institution where Karin lives during parts of the series.  Story  The plot is based on Familjen Anderssons sjuka jul and the Christmas show featured H√•kan as the protagonist. Contrary to the belief of Sune, H√•kan is actually a very nice and thoughtful 7-year-old boy. He is quite ingenious and does lots of pranks that usually puts him or others in a tight spot but this is seldom his intended purpose. When H√•kan's mother Karin is doing all of the Christmas chores, she becomes so stressed she eventually winds up in a mental hospital, and this is the main story of the TV show since Christmas is ending and there is still no Christmas presents or candy. Chaos ensues. H√•kan's rather stupid father Rudolf is by his side in this and throughout the show he tries his best to make Christmas perfect, but fails miserably. He and H√•kan try to bring the mother home from a crazed doctor at the mental institution who is obsessed with keeping the mother there and not having to celebrate Christmas alone. The series got quite bad reviews, mainly because the scenario was deemed to be unrealistic. It was also considered a bit depressing for a TV show aimed at kids. Many said it was also too vulgar with too many innuendo jokes and toilet humor, a few examples of this are when H√•kan vomits cascades, when harasses his teacher Veronica and felt her breasts and when H√•kan dreamed about drinking beer. Mobile telephones aren't used, but the TV sets use remote controls. The classroom reminds of schools from old days. Recording In early February 1999 it was announced that H√•kan Br√•kan would get his own TV series. which later turned out to become the 2003 SVT Christmas calendar.

The first station, which was on the west side of the tracks, was completed in 1853 by the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad. The current building was constructed on the east side of the tracks in 1904 by the Grand Trunk Railway. The two storey wooden frame building has a single storey conical roofed southerly end and a small extension on the north end. One of the fa√ßades includes a two-story bay window topped by a gable-pediment. The old station is located in a semi-wooded area in a residential area of the town.  History  During the 1840s, the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad, built a railway line. This connected by rail Montreal to the port facilities of Portland in the state of Maine. The residents of the township of Barnston succeeded in convincing the officials of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad to include Coaticook, which was then only a small hamlet on the route of the railway line. The first passenger train stopped in Coaticook in 1853. The railway, which subsequently changed its name to the Grand Trunk Railroad was completed in 1859. The first station was completed in 1853. It was replaced by a new station in 1904. The heritage value of the old Coaticook station is based on its architectural interest. It is representative of a new type of station that appeared at the turn of the twentieth century. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, the Grand Trunk Railway made significant changes to the architecture of its stations. These buildings are distinguished by their picturesque character which derogates from the maximum profitability rule which was observed before. The picturesque movement comes from a theory of aesthetics which promotes a more intimate relationship between architecture and landscaped environment. The buildings was designed according to these principles having a wide variety of shapes and producing visual effects through an assortment of volumes and materials. The old Coaticook station is representative of this architecture in particular by its rectangular plan with a rounded end, its complex roof, numerous protrusions such as bay windows and the conical roof porch as well as its elaborate and varied ornamentation. It is a good example of the use of completed picturesque principles in the architecture of railroad stations. Coaticook Station today. The heritage value of the old Coaticook station is also based on its historical interest. It shows the importance of the railway in the economic development of the city. Following the construction of the railway, many textile industries and wood and iron processing plants were quickly implanted in Coaticook. The train also drives the growth of the agricultural industry by regularly sending fresh milk to markets in Montreal. In 1904, the old station replaces a first building constructed on the same site in 1853. The passenger train service is interrupted in 1958. Since 1980, freight trains no longer stop in Coaticook. The presence of the old train station in the heart of Coaticook recalls the importance of rail infrastructure in its municipal history.

He was conservative, and worked closely with the colonial authorities. He thought that progress would only be possible if Africans adopted European ideas and institutions. Ajasa was one of the leaders of the People's Union, the first political party in Nigeria, and was the founder of the conservative newspaper the Nigerian Pioneer. He was the first Nigerian to be knighted. Early years Kitoye Ajasa was from a branch of the Saro community that had migrated from Ajase in Dahomey to Lagos. His father, Thomas Benjamin Macaulay, had been born in Dahomey, taken into slavery and then freed in Sierra Leone. Kitoye Ajasa was originally called Edmund Macaulay. He was born in Lagos on 10 August 1866. He studied at CMS Grammar School, Lagos. He then moved to England where he attended Dulwich College, a public school, and then studied law at the Inner Temple Inn of Court. He was called to the bar in 1893. He changed his name to Kitoye Ajasa after spending twelve years in London. He returned to Lagos, where he started his legal practice. He married Lucretia Olayinka Moore, an Egba princess. Politician and publisher In 1906, Ajasa became an unofficial member of the Legislative Council, and in 1914 was made a member of the Nigerian Council of Governor- General Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard (1858‚Äì1945). Ajasa and others such as John K. Randle, Christopher Sapara Williams and Henry Rawlingson Carr thought obstructing the British administration was counter-productive, since it was only through the British that development would be possible. Ajasa called radicals \\"water rate agitators.\\" He advocated full adoption of European ideas and institutions as the fastest way to make progress. His contemporaries attacked him for this attitude, saying his newspaper was \\"the guardian angel of an oligarchy of reactionaries\\", and wondering why \\"any man in Lagos, African by birth, race and descent ... should be so wholly devoid of race consciousness, and utterly oblivious of appreciation of the duties, obligations and responsibilities devolving on him.\\" Ajasa was one of the leading members of the People's Union founded in 1908 by John Randle (1855‚Äì1928). Others were Orisadipe Obasa (1863‚Äì1940), Richard Akinwande Savage (1874‚Äì1935) and Adeyemo Alakija (1884‚Äì1952). Although the People's Union was controlled by men with conservative views, it attracted some professionals with progressive ideas such as Ernest Ikoli (1893‚Äì1960), journalist and founder of the Nigerian Youth Movement. The People's Union, which was in favour of gradual introduction of reforms, opposed the more radical and nationalist Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP) founded in 1922 by Herbert Macaulay. The People's Union dissolved in 1928 after Randle died. Ajasa founded the Nigerian Pioneer in 1914 as an alternative to the radical Weekly Record of John Payne Jackson (1848‚Äì1915). Because he was known to be a confidant of Lugard, it was widely thought that the government funded the paper. The newspaper generally supported government measures and opposed people and organisations that the government disliked. It did not indulge in anti-governments polemics as did other papers at the time, and was distrusted by many of the people of Lagos. Ajasa wrote in 1923 that his paper \\"existed in order to interpret thoroughly and accurately the Government to the people and the people to the Government\\". Kitoye Ajasa became a Judge of the High Court of Lagos. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1924 Birthday Honours and was made a knight in the 1928 Birthday Honours. He was the first Nigerian to be knighted. Ajasa remained a legislator until 1933. He died in 1937. The Nigerian Pioneer closed down after his death. His children included the Nigerian nationalist and feminist Oyinkan, Lady Abayomi (1897‚Äì1990). Freemasonry Sir Kitoyi was a Freemason and had a very high regard for Freemasonry. He was installed Worshipful Master of Lagos Lodge No. 1171 in 1901, 1906, 1907, 1908 & 1928\\\\. Quotations Some opinions that Ajasa expressed in the Pioneer: *\\"We in West Africa have been for generations under British rule and with that rule we are satisfied.\\" (7 September 1917) *\\"... it might be suicidal for any empire to let the subject races into its secrets by having them employed in positions of trust ...\\" (7 September 1917) *\\"[the government should] look upon the educated natives as an asset of the Empire to be utilised in Imperial interests.\\" (7 September 1917) *\\"An educated class is fast growing among natives throughout ... the African continent. The more highly educated the African is the more intense is his love for his country, and the more he presses for a greater and more effective voice in the shaping of the destiny of his people ... But the educated native still cries in the wilderness ... his cry must be heeded some day.\\" (14 September 1917) *\\"Nigeria's lot is cast, and God grant it will, nay, and must be cast for years to come in and within the Empire...\\" (17 October 1930) References Sources   Category:1866 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Nigerian lawyers Category:Saro people Category:19th-century Nigerian lawyers Category:Politicians from Lagos Category:CMS Grammar School, Lagos alumni Category:20th-century Nigerian politicians Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Nigeria Category:People educated at Dulwich College Category:Yoruba politicians Category:Yoruba legal professionals Category:People of colonial Nigeria Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Nigerian knights Category:Lawyers from Lagos Kitoye Category:Nigerian Freemasons ","title":"Kitoye Ajasa"},{"id":"45687689","text":"Euan's Guide is an accessibility review website based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

History The ETC Group was known as RAFI (Rural Advancement Foundation International) until 1 September 2001, and its history runs back to the National Sharecroppers Fund that was established in the 1930s by Eleanor Roosevelt (amongst others) to alleviate the plight of poor, mostly black tenant farmers in the U.S. In the early 1970s, Pat Mooney, Hope Shand, and Cary Fowler began working on the Seeds Issue through the Rural Advancement Foundation--and, in time, set up an international arm concerned with the rights of farmers in the global south. RAFI pioneered civil society research, critiques and advocacy on farmers rights, seed monopoly laws, and opposes adoption of genetic engineering in agriculture, patents on life and biopiracy (a term that RAFI coined) and new life science technologies such as terminator technology, genomic technologies, and nanotechnology. RAFI played a key role is pushing for and shaping UN recognition of farmers' rights and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Advised to change their name in order to secure nonprofit status in the United States, RAFI launched a name change contest on their website in early 2001. After consulting hundreds of suggestions the organization decided upon ETC Group (etcetera). Geoengineering The organisation has taken a public campaigning stance against geoengineering, including a campaign called \\"Hands off Mother Earth!\\", which was launched in April 2010. In October 2010 a comprehensive report titled \\"Geopiracy - The Case Against Geoengineering\\" was published,ETC Group: Geopiracy - The Case Against Geoengineering , published 2011-10-18 covering proposed technologies, governance discussions, geoengineering key players and the roles and interests of military and corporations. Diana Bronson of the ETC Group stated global warming was caused by \\"the scientific, corporate and political establishment of developed countries\\", and to now think those same people will correct the climate crisis and the biosphere is na√Øve. Synthetic biology The ETC group publicly campaigns for increased regulation in the emerging scientific field of synthetic biology, which they refer to as \\"extreme genetic engineering\\". The group's major areas of concern surrounding this field include corporate involvement, and potential threats to biosafety and biosecurity. In an effort to inform opinion about synthetic biology, the ETC Group has released several comic-style illustrations regarding \\"Synthia\\", the cell with the first synthetic genome created by Craig Venter and the J. Craig Venter Institute. The illustration titled \\"The Story of Synthia\\" has also been adapted into a short video that can be viewed on YouTube. On December 16, 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues released a report that recommended self-regulation by synthetic biologists, stating that the infant technology posed few risks to society. This decision was strongly opposed by Jim Thomas of the ETC Group, who referred to the recommendations by the commission as \\"disappointingly empty and timid\\". The ETC group joined a group of over 50 environmental groups calling for a moratorium on synthetic biology in a letter to government officials that referred to results of the commission as \\"irresponsible and dangerous\\" and stated that \\"self-regulation amounts to no regulation\\". On January 23, 2012, UC Berkeley's Richmond Field Station was chosen for the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's second campus. In a news conference meant to address the concerns surrounding synthetic biology at the local, national, and international level, five panelists including Jim Thomas of ETC Group, spoke on the risks associated with synthetic biology. The panel refers to the laboratory's association with UC Berkeley as a \\"shiny veneer\\" for a poorly regulated industry with dangerous consequences, and Thomas referred to the \\"1.6 billion dollar industry\\" as \\"genetic engineering on steroids\\".

With the challenges that the institution was experiencing at the time including ineffective risk management and non-adherence to corporate governance best practices, he initiated and launched a transformation agenda with the assistance of KPMG professional services.nigeriadevelopmentandfinanceforum.org/policydialogue/dialogue Family background and early education Orya was born in Ugwe, Benue State, Nigeria, from a poor background and a father who was physically challenged. His mother seemed to have encouraged her son's desire for education; she didn't go to school but was passionate about education. As the first of eight children, Orya endured great difficulties and hardships in the pursuit of education. He later attended Benue State Polytechnic from where he got an Ordinary National Diploma after completing his studies at the Teacher's College where he obtained a National Certificate of Education (NCE) because of his desire to one day be a teacher, even though ended up in banking. Orya attended the University of Ibadan, Nigeria and graduated with an M.Sc in Banking and Finance.http://nyenrode.nl/FacultyResearch/Entrepreneurship- Stewardship/CS/International%20Sustainable%20Business/conferences/2012conferenceBoostingInvestments/Pages/Robert- Orya Work experience His career in banking began in February 1984 when he joined the services of International Merchant Bank Plc and worked up until September 1990 when he left to join Credite Bank of Nigeria Limited briefly as a pioneer staff. He was then seconded to Prime Merchant Bank Ltd in July 1991 as Head of Operations. Orya subsequently moved to Pace Mortgage Finance Ltd in October 1992 as the General Manager/Chief Executive Officer. He thereafter joined Lobi Bank of Nigeria Ltd in January 1994 and later became the Managing Director and Executive Chairman until January 1998 when he was reassigned to Premier Commercial Bank Plc as an Executive Director. Orya's last appointment was as an Executive Director in charge of Capital Markets, Financial Advisory Services and Research & Strategy with Afribank Capital Ltd. He held the position until his appointment on 14 August 2009, as the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Export-Import Bank. Leadership at NEXIM Bank The Federal Government reconstituted the Board of Directors of the Nigerian Export ‚Äì Import Bank on 14 August 2009, including the appointment of a new Executive Management team of which is headed by Robert Orya. It was an effort at resuscitating the bank. By all financial and operational yardsticks, the bank was in dire straits. Its total loan portfolio was ‚Ç¶14.6 billion out of which 72% was non-performing. Within that category, ‚Ç¶10.03 billion or 69% was classified as completely lost. This ensured the depletion of the bank's shareholders fund. It took considerable efforts to lay out the state of the affairs of the bank, as a result of poor record-keeping. In spite of a bloated staff headcount, significant skill gaps were identified in the system. Before his assumption of office, NEXIM Bank at that time lacked visibility in the banking and media spaces. All the woes can be summarized as resulting from ineffective risk management framework and non-adherence to corporate governance best practices.http://nigeriadevelopmentandfinanceforum.org/PolicyDialogue/Dialogue By December 2009, the new management of the bank under the leadership of its Managing Director, Roberts Orya, inherited huge bad debts totaling about ‚Ç¶14.6 billion, about 72 per cent of which was categorized as non-performing, while over ‚Ç¶10.03 billion, or 69.05 per cent, was classified lost or irrecoverable in line with prudential guidelines.premiumtimesng.com/business/143458-analysis-nexim-turns-the- positive-curve-poised-for-more NEXIM Bank under the leadership of Orya as MD/CEO seeks to help sustain Nigeria's role as a leader on the continent, particularly by harmonizing commerce in the West African region. Orya's vision (at NEXIM) is to see a significant reduction in the high transportation costs, which taken alongside reduction in the present excessive transit time, would place West African products in a vantage position to compete with goods from other markets.thenigerianvoice.com/news/112179/1/nexim-sealink-re-awakening- africas-giant. Under his leadership the bank now focused on sectors that have high job-creation and high export potentials in the non-oil sectors. These sectors are manufacturing, agro-processing, solid minerals and services, which are encapsulated in our MASS Agenda. Let me first highlight the key financial performances. Within 18 months of assumption of duty, the management had turned around the fortunes of the bank and ensured that it is a profit- rather than a loss-making organization.nigeriadevelopmentandfinanceforum.org/PolicyDialogue/Dialogue He led the rollout of the bank's first intranet, deployed on a robust IT infrastructure. The Finacle Banking Software proposal has been forwarded to the Federal Ministry of Finance for endorsement and for appropriate recommendations to be made to the Federal Executive Council for approval. Process automation is expected to commence after deployment of the banking software. They are at a very advanced stage in the conversion of the Bank to IFRS. Also the human capital is completely transformed with the engagement of highly skilled and motivated personnel such as the Chief Risk Officer; Internal Auditor; Head, Remedial Management; Head, Strategic Planning and Head, Corporate Communication. Staff attrition rate has been virtually zero; the only staff that has left the bank in 2014 was dismissed on grounds of misconduct and non- performance.nigeriadevelopmentandfinanceforum.org/PolicyDialogue/Dialogue Achievements and initiatives At NEXIM Bank Orya led the initiative of the Nigeria Export Import (NEXIM) Bank, in conjunction with the Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FEWACCI), in floating the Sealink project, refreshing with the ray of hope it offers to the sub-region.

The Smith College Archives document the life of the College by collecting materials created by students, faculty, administrative and departmental staff during the course of their time here. The records in the College Archives can provide researchers with answers to specific questions or help them to understand broad social and cultural issues. The collections contain materials derived from: * administrative records * biographical records * academic life * student life * buildings and grounds * audiovisual materials The collection spans nearly 20,000 linear feet and is one of the contributing collections to \\"The History of Women‚Äôs Education Open Access Portal Project\\" funded through the National Endowment for the Humanities. History Nina Browne Of the class of 1882, Nina Browne's career as an archivist began in 1921, when she was hired by Smith College as its first archivist of the Smith College Archives. Browne had been active in the Alumna Association, and material from her time as a student (saved by her mother) formed the basis of the early collection. Though she was initially hired with an eye to the college's 50th anniversary in 1925, she remained in her position long after the event. She became partially blind, which set her retirement in motion in 1937. Browne remained a strong advocate for the archive, asserting its importance and the need for a physical space for the collection. Margaret Storrs Grierson stepped into the role of college archivist in 1940. Elizabeth Cutter Morrow Supporting the work Browne had begun, Elizabeth Cutter Morrow officially established the Archives of Smith College in March, 1940. As acting-president of Smith College, Mrs. Morrow advocated that \\"several institutions of higher learning, Amherst and Harvard [to mention only two] had set aside space and provided personnel not only for the preservation of documents related to the early history of the institution but also to preserve material which had reference to its development through successive periods, including the present, and included material connected with administrators, faculty members, and students.\\" Margaret Storrs Grierson In 1940, Mrs. Morrow appointed Margaret Storrs Grierson to the professional position of Archivist. Present Today the College Archives are actively used by researchers and incorporated into dozens of curricula.

She built up a successful business in Edinburgh, Scotland and published 16 volumes on knitting that helped make it a popular pastime for ladies and a source of income for lower classes of women. Her unusually written pattern books are important in the history of textiles in Scotland. Biography Gaugain was born in the early 1800s and was the daughter of a tailor. After marrying cloth importer J.J. Gaugain, she worked in her husband's shop at 63 George Street and helped turn it into a thriving haberdashery. Gaugain wrote and disseminated knitting patterns throughout the 1830s from her shop and published her first pattern book in 1840. It was called \\"Lady's Assistant in Knitting, Netting and Crochet.\\" She had a particular way of writing her patterns with full instructions at the beginning detailing the meanings of abbreviations. The book was very popular. The book reached a massive audience in the UK and America and was the best-selling knitting book of the period. It ran to 22 editions. Throughout the 1840s and 50s, she published a great many titles. In response to reader's feedback, she began to produce charted paper and instructions that allowed knitters to create their own designs and began accepting mail orders at the Edinburgh shop. Gaugain died in 1860. She is buried in Edinburgh's Dean Cemetery near the waters of Leith. Legacy In 2012, knitter Franklin Habit adapted one of Jane Gaugain's patterns, a pineapple-shaped purse, for a modern audience in the summer 2012 issue of Knitty. Knitters today continue to use and be inspired by Jane Gaugain's patterns and she is beginning to be recognized as an 'unsung hero' of the history of women entrepreneurs and knitting.

Its scope covers basic, translational, clinical and experimental studies. The journal is published by Bioscientifica on behalf of the Society for Endocrinology. It is also an official journal of the European Society of Endocrinology and the Japanese Hormone and Cancer Society. The editor-in-chief is Charis Eng (Cleveland Clinic) and, according to the ISI Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2019 impact factor of 4.800.  History  Endocrine-Related Cancer was founded as Reviews on Endocrine- Related Cancer, the in-house journal of Zeneca (now AstraZeneca) published by its parent company ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was taken over by the Society for Endocrinology in 1994 when it was renamed, and the remit was extended to include a limited number of original research articles to complement the existing reviews. The numbers of research articles gradually increased over time. The editor-in-chief of the journal at the time of the name change and remit extension was Vivian H.T. James, who took the journal‚Äôs precursor and set Endocrine-Related Cancer on a firm footing for development and expansion. Marc Lippman took over leadership in 2000 and managed the fourfold increase in published pages. He also oversaw an impact factor increase from 0.933 in 1999 to 4.597 in 2004.https://www.endocrinology.org/endocrinologist/095/095.pdf In 2006, Endocrine-Related Cancer was adopted as an official journal by the European Society of Endocrinology, in 2014 by the Endocrine Society of Australia and in 2015 by the Japan Hormone and Cancer Society. James Fagin held the role of editor-in-chief from 2006 to 2010.

This object was worshipped or constituted a tangible representation of a cult image. The Western Slavs transcribed and pronounced the word as ba≈Çwan (), which is its contemporary and old Polish lexical manifestation, whereas most Southern Slavs and the Eastern Slavs used the just slightly differently-vowelled bolvan (). In the Kyrgyz language of Central Asia, geographically remote from the territories Slavs are today identified with in Europe, balvan is a \\"strongman\\" or a hero, whereas in Persian, pahlevƒÅn denotes a militant or a veteran, as well as the plinth or boundary marker erected in his or her honor, or even a cairn, and, by extension, a fool. That latter meaning, at first secondary, became primary after Christianity was imposed on the Slavs, making ba≈Çwan acquire a distinctly pejorative primary meaning. Some suggest that the Slavs share throughout their idioms such as they have evolved apart this single entity -- a common term for all cult objects in the form of a statue or cairn -- might suggest that idolatry spread early among the Slavic peoples, perhaps when they came in contact with Turkic peoples or Iranian.

Politicians who have used the phrase include John Boehner, Rick Scott, Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal, and Mitch McConnell. It has been criticized by Coral Davenport writing for The New York Times, and by Steven Benen of the Rachel Maddow Show, and was satirized by Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report. President Barack Obama singled the phrase out in his 2015 State of the Union speech, saying: > I‚Äôve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence [of global climate change] > by saying they‚Äôre not scientists; that we don‚Äôt have enough information to > act.

The Old Bund is on the north bank of the Yong River. It was the site of the Port of Ningbo since 1840s till late 1990s. The North Riverbank was the result of Treaty of Nanking, and witnessed the initiation and development of Ningbo Commercial Group.  History  Cathedral of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows The Old Bund sat piers of the Port of Ningbo, and all the trade between Ningbo and Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia was made through it. The trading tracked back to 1842 when the Sino-Britain Treaty of Nanking was signed, and Ningbo was thereafter a trading port. Ever since then the westerners came to Ningbo. However, ships could not make it into the ancient port, and therefore the North Riverbank came into being.Ê±üÂåóËÄÅÂ§ñÊª©ÂÆ¢ËøêÁ†ÅÂ§¥ÔºöÂüéÂ∏ÇÂèëÂ±ïÁöÑËÆ∞ÂøÜÁ¨¶Âè∑ In 1844, Ningbo was officially opened as a trading port, the North Riverbank was hence the residential spot for foreign merchants. The North Riverbank became the first Bund in China, 20 years before The Bund of Shanghai. Western modern facilities and buildings were built along the North Riverbank ever since, which marks the beginning of the modernization of Ningbo. However, the Port of Shanghai caught up later, and the importance of the Port of Ningbo decreased. In 1927, the Chinese government regained the administration of the Old Bund, and it became an important transportation terminus for both passengers and cargo.

M. Tam√°s; ; born 28 November 1932), often referred to in the media as TGM, is a Hungarian marxist-anarcho-syndicalist philosopher and public intellectual. He is currently a contributor to online newspaper M√©rce and to OpenDemocracy, where he writes primarily about political and aesthetic questions. Biography G√°sp√°r Mikl√≥s Tam√°s was born in today's Cluj, Romania, but he has been living in Budapest, Hungary, for years. His mother was Jewish and escaped being deported to Auschwitz because she was imprisoned for being a communist.http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/words-from- budapest-2/ As a dissident at the end of the state socialist (communist) period, he was initially a libertarian socialist. While in contact with libertarian authors, his perspective is distinct from the Budapest School, a major school of thought in Hungarian Neo-Marxism. He was also the member of the informal group called democratic opposition. From 1986 to 1988, he taught in the U.S., Britain, and France, and also continued his studies at Oxford University. At the beginning of the post-socialist era in 1989, he became committed to a liberal program, and was a leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats. He served in the Hungarian Parliament as a representative of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), from 1989 to 1994. He re-identified as a Marxist in the early years of the 21st century. He served as President of the extra-parliamentary Green Left between 2010 and 2011. He is a vocal opponent of the Hungarian government led by Viktor Orb√°n and the Fidesz party, as well as capitalism and neoliberalism. His theoretical work draws on the ideas of Italian autonomism (Antonio Negri), German Neue Marx-Lekt√ºre (Hans-Georg Backhaus and Helmut Reichelt), and American Political Marxism (Robert Brenner and Ellen Meiksins Wood). He also refers to the insights of - among others - Georges Bataille and Moishe Postone. He is known for developing the concept of post-fascism. and also invented the term ethnicism.

Biography Gooding was born to Asa and Matilda (Hunt) Gooding in Greenfield, Indiana on June 14, 1838. He was educated in local schools and graduated from Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in 1859. As a university student he was a member of Beta Theta Pi. After college, Gooding worked briefly as a teacher in Macon, Tennessee and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Seeing that conflict was coming, he returned north and was reading law and working as a school principal in Carlinville, Illinois when the American Civil War began. Following the outbreak of hostilities, Gooding enlisted in the 122nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In addition to combat service, he was for a time acting judge advocate for the western Kentucky military district. By the end of the war, Gooding had risen to the rank of first lieutenant. After the war, Gooding worked as an attorney in Washington D.C. before moving to Evansville, Indiana in 1868. There he quickly became involved in Republican politics. In 1870, Gooding was his party's nominee for Indiana's 1st congressional district. While he lost the race, he won acclaim for his performance in a series of debates with the incumbent candidate. Between 1872 and 1875 he served two terms in the Indiana Senate. Fraternally, Gooding was a Mason and member of the Knights Templar. He was also active in veteran concerns, being a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and serving as commander of his local Grand Army of the Republic post. Gooding married Mary Viele Babcock on February 15, 1871. The couple had two children: Gertie and Clay. President Benjamin Harrison nominated Gooding to become Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on March 13, 1890. The nomination was made despite Harrison's policy of selecting men who already lived within the territory. Senate confirmation came on April 26. Gooding left for the territory on May 1 and took his oath of office in Prescott on May 7, 1890. By most traditional measures, Gooding had a successful career as a judge. During his three years of service at the district level, he saw just eleven of his decisions appealed and only two of those decisions reversed by a higher court. At the appellate level, he wrote a dozen opinions, a number of which served as precedents in later cases. In Territory of Arizona v. Blevins, 4 Arizona 68 (1893), Gooding granted a new trial after it was determined the trial court had made a fatal error by not having the defendant enter a plea before the jury reached a verdict. In Oury v. Goodwin, 3 Arizona 225 (1891) he found that land used to build a canal system qualified as public use for purposes of eminent domain determinations while Territory of Arizona v. Delinquent Tax-List of the County of Maricopa, 3 Arizona 302 (1891) determined that the territory could tax railroads crossing Indian reservations unless the Federal government explicitly granted the railroads an exemption. Gooding found in Liebes v. Steffy, 4 Arizona 11 (1893) that separate property owned by a wife was unaffected by debts incurred by her husband. With the coming of a Democratic administration in the White House, Gooding resigned on May 4, 1893. After leaving the bench, the former chief justice remained in the territory until 1895, when he moved to Los Angeles, California. There he continued to practice law while staying active in veteran and Masonic activities. On March 11, 1900, Gooding was shot by a pair of assailants attempting to rob him. The assailants were never captured. The former chief justice recovered from the wound but the bullet, lodged near his heart, was never removed. Gooding died September 14, 1913. The bullet near his heart may have been a contributing factor in his death. Gooding was interred in a mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery.

Biography Truesdale was born to Calvin and Charlotte (Haynes) Truesdale in Rock Island, Illinois on February 8, 1860. He was the brother of William Haynes Truesdale. Growing up in Rock Island, he was educated in local schools. Truesdale graduated from the State University of Iowa (now University of Iowa) in 1880 and earned a degree from the university's law school two years later. Following graduation, he was admitted to the bar in 1882 and moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota soon after. There he was in a law partnership with Thomas Lowry for a time before joining the firm of Truesdale, Lawrence, and Corrington. Around this time he married Martha Langdon, the daughter of a prominent contractor. The union produced a son and a daughter. In 1895, Truesdale moved his family to Phoenix, Arizona Territory. The move allowed him access to the Minnesota & Arizona Construction Company's affairs, a firm in which his father-in-law owned a stake. A life-time Republican, Truesdale had been mostly politically inactive. He had however served as a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention and met William McKinley at that time. In his letter of application, Truesdale admitted to being largely uninformed about the appointment process and mentioned that his father had known the incoming president when they were both living in Poland, Ohio. Perhaps more influential, Truesdale secured recommendations from Russell A. Alger, fifteen United States Senators, and a variety of United States Congressmen. President McKinley nominated Truesdale to be Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on June 26, 1897. Senate confirmation came on July 8, 1897. The new chief justice was assigned to Arizona's third judicial district, comprising Maricopa and Yuma counties. He spent his first few months as a judge in Santa Monica, California escaping Arizona's summertime heat and preparing himself for his new duties. Upon his return to Arizona, he went to Prescott to substitute for Justice Richard Elihu Sloan in a case, which would become Wiser v. Lawler, 7 Arizona 163 (1900) upon appeal, involving the sale of a group of mining properties. Truesdale's opinion, which found for the plaintiffs, was described as \\"one of the ablest given in the Territory.\\" On October 2, 1897, Truesdale underwent a minor surgical procedure to remove a growth in his nostril. While the operation initially appeared successful, complications developed two days later. The patient's health declined and his family was called to him from Minnesota. Truesdale died from meningitis complicated by typhoid on October 28, 1897. He was buried in Minneapolis' Lakewood Cemetery.

The French captured her in late September 1810, only to have the British recapture her in early December. She returned to the service of the Bombay Marine, assisting the British Government and the Royal Navy in various campaigns in the East Indies and the Persian Gulf. She was still listed on the rolls of the Bombay Marine on 1 January 1828. Career Aurora went into active service shortly after she was launched. Under the command of Lieutenant Conyers, she participated the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809.Low (1877), p.330. The Royal Navy and the EIC sent a large force to the Persian Gulf to force the Al Qasimi (or Joasmi) to cease their raids on British ships, particularly on the Persian and Arab coasts of the Straits of Hormuz. The operation's success was limited as British were unable to suppress permanently the strong fleets of the Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. Capture and recapture Aurora, under the command of Lieutenant Watkins, left Bombay on 16 August 1810 on a cruise. Lloyd's List reported that the French frigates Iphigenia and Astree had captured Aurora, of 10 guns and 100 men, in October.Lloyd's List, no.4525, ‚Äì accessed 12 March 2015. French records reveal that Iphig√©nie, under Acting Captain Bouvet, and Astr√©e captured Aurora, of 16-guns, on 20 September 1810. Both reports agree that her captors took her to √éle de France. The French Navy then took Aurora into service as the corvette Aurore.Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 183. The British recaptured Aurora, and several other EIC vessels, as a consequence of their successful invasion of Isle de France in November‚ÄìDecember 1810.Low (1877), p.230. Aurora then returned to Bombay and the EIC's service. When the French captured British vessels they tried to get sailors, marines, and in the case of EIC ships, lascars, to join the French Navy. Apparently they generally had some success, particularly with Irishmen and lascars. However, in the case of Aurora, her marine detachment of 16 or 17 sepoys, recruited from among the Concanny Purwarries and serving in the Marine Battalion of the Bombay Marine, were steadfast in resisting first blandishments and then harsh treatment. Invasion of Java and punitive expeditions In 1811, the Royal Navy and the EIC combined to launch an invasion of Java. The EIC contributed several warships, including Aurora, under the command of Commander Watkins, and several East Indiamen and other transports.Low (1877), p.238. In December Aurora was in Calcutta when the news arrived that a large group of Burmese had invaded the area of Chittagong. Captain Macdonald of Aurora assembled a force consisting of Aurora and the EIC's cruisers Phoenix, Thetis, and Vestal, as well as a 900 troops. The Troops disembarked at Chittagong on 6 December, at which point the Burmese retreated.Low (1877), pp.275-76. In 1812, Palimbang was under British control, with Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as the governor of British Java. The ex- sultan of Palimbang established a stockade a few miles up from the city. From there he intercepted supplies and threatened the new sultan. Major Mears of the Bombay Army and Captain MacDonald of Aurora sent 200 men in boats to capture the stockade. They were able to do so, though not without the loss of Major Mears.Low (1877), p.252. That same year, , , and , and a detachment of 100 men from the 48th Highlanders set out on a punitive expedition against the Sultanate of Sambas, along the Sambas River in western Borneo. Barracouta was unable to force the river defenses and the expedition retreated after she suffered some casualties.Low (1877), p.256-60. From January Aurora and some gunboats then maintained a blockade until a second punitive expedition arrived in June 1813. While she maintained the blockade, Aurora recaptured some valuable Chinese junks, and unsuccessfully chased the ship Coromandel, up the river. For the second punitive expedition against Sambas, the Royal Navy contingent consisted of , , , , , and Procris, with Captain Sayer of Leda as the senior naval officer. The EIC contributed the cruisers Malabar, Teignmouth, and Aurora, seven gunboats, the transport Troubridge, and the East Indiaman . The army contingent consisted of the 14th Regiment of Foot, a company each from the Bengal artillery and the HEIC's European Regiment, and the 3rd Bengal Volunteer Battalion. Eventually the British vessels, except the frigates, were able to cross the bar in front of the river and move towards the town of Sambas. Capturing two forts yielded over 70 brass and iron guns of mixed calibers, but the town of itself yielded little booty. The expedition was able to recapture the Portuguese brig Coromandel, which the pirates had captured the year before. British casualties from combat were relatively low, but casualties from fever and disease were high. In early 1814 the British Army officer in charge at Palimbang replaced the current sultan with the old sultan, in retirement in the interior. Raffles sent Captain MacDonald and Aurora, to investigate the situation. The old sultan was deposed and his predecessor reinstated.Low (1877), p.250; footnote. In April, the EIC put together a small force consisting of Malabar, under Captain Robert Deane, the overall naval commander, Teignmouth, Aurora, and some gunboats, and an Army contingent under the command of Major-General Miles Nightingale. On 7 June the British attacked Makassar, burning the rajah's palace. The rajah fled and the British were able to impose a new rajah. Shortly thereafter, Aurora returned to Calcutta, carrying the Army staff and several officials.Low (1877), pp.260-1. Incident in 1816 Maratha raiders posed a longstanding problem for the EIC. Apparently in 1816 Aurora engaged in combat with a flotilla of these raiders, supposedly in the Bay of Bengal. The painting above shows Aurora engaging two grabs and numerous gallivats.A grab (from the Marathi gurab), was a two or three-masted ship generally found on the Malabar Coast. A gallivat was a small vessel resembling a Mediterranean felucca, and like a felucca carried a triangular sail. The problem with the Maratha navy ended with the British victory in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817‚Äì18), which brought the Maratha Empire under EIC control. Incident in 1817 In January 1817 Aurora was under the command of Captain Jeakes. She was towing a large \\"baghalah\\", which carried treasure from Kuwait and destined for the Imaum of Muscat. As they were sailing down the Gulf, 15 \\"dhows and trankies\\" manned by Jaoasmi pirates attacked them, attempting to capture the baghalah. Jeakes managed by skilful sailing to maneuver Aurora to bring her guns to bear and sink many of the dhows. When Aurora and the baghalah arrived at Muscat, the Imaum presented Captain Jeakes with a valuable sword and an Arabian horse. Aurora then continued her journey onto Bombay.Low (1877), pp.239-41. Punitive expedition against Ras-al-Khaima In November 1819, the British embarked on an expedition against the Al Qasimi, led by Major-General William Keir Grant, voyaging to Ras Al Khaimah with a platoon of 3,000 soldiers. The British extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat in which he would be made ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition. Obligingly, he sent a force of 600 men and two ships. Ras Al Khaimah fell to British forces on 9 December 1819 The naval force consisted of Liverpool, , , and a number of gun and mortar boats. Captain Collier, of Liverpool, 'led the naval force. The Bombay Marine of the East India Company (EIC) contributed six armed vessels: the 16-gun Teignmouth under the command of Captain Hall, the EIC senior captain, the 16-gun Benares, the 14-gun Aurora, the 14-gun Nautilus, the 12-gun Ariel and the 12-gun Vestal.The United service magazine, Vol. 141, pp.77-81. Later two frigates and 600 men belonging to the Sultan of Muscat joined the expedition. On the army side, Major General Sir William Keir commanded some 3,000 troops in transports, including the 47th and 65th Regiments of Foot, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry, the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry and of the Marine Battalion, and half a company of Pioneers. In all, 1,645 European and 1,424 Indian soldiers ('sepoys') and marines took part in the expedition. The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea. Collier placed Captain Walpole of Curlew in charge of the gun boats and an armed pinnace to protect the landing, which was, however, unopposed.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711‚Äì15. The bombardment of the town commenced on 6 December, from landed batteries of 12 pound guns and mortars as well as from sea. On 7 December, two 24-pound cannon from Liverpool were added to the land batteries. The rout of Ras Al Khaimah led to only five British casualties as opposed to the 400 to 1000 casualties reportedly suffered by the Al Qasimi. Following the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, the Aurora, together with Curlew and Nautilus, were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah. Following a three-day bombardment, Dhayah Fort surrendered on 22 December. The British expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting Jazirat Al Hamra, which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711‚Äì15. Fate The last readily available online mention of Aurora notes that she was still listed as serving the Bombay Marine on 1 January 1828.Low (1877), p.479.

Biography Lewis was born to George Roberts and Nancy June (McLane) Lewis in Indiana, Pennsylvania on December 27, 1875. He was educated in public schools and enrolled at the University of Minnesota. He contracted a severe case of pneumonia three months before graduation and, based upon a recommendation from a friend, moved to Arizona Territory to recover. Lewis worked for six months at an agricultural research station in Tucson while continuing to study law. After completing his degree requirements for the University of Minnesota, he was admitted to the Arizona bar in 1900. After obtaining his law license, Lewis practiced law in Phoenix. He formed a law partnership with Thomas Armstrong Jr. in 1904. Except for his years as a judge, Lewis remained active in the partnership until his death. Socially, Lewis was a Mason with membership in the Knights Templar and the Shriners. He was president of the Arizona Club at the time of his death as well as active in Rotary International. Lewis married Ethel May Orme of Phoenix on February 19, 1902. The union produced two sons and a daughter. President William Howard Taft nominated Lewis to become an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Courton April 30, 1909. Senate confirmation occurred on May 18. He was assigned to the fifth district, comprising Gila, Graham, and Greenlee counties. While serving on the court he lived in Globe. Writing twelve opinions during his time on the court, three of Lewis's opinions had significant impact as precedents. Tevis et al. v. Ryan, 13 Arizona 120 (1910) was a multi-issued case that was later cited for how it dealt with several procedural issues as well as interactions between the fields of contracts, corporations, and damages. Mayhew v. Brislin 13 Arizona 102 (1910) dealt with realtor commissions involved in the sale of mining properties while Williams v. Territory of Arizona 13 Arizona 27 (1910) became the \\"leading Arizona case on bogus checks\\". Hicks v. Krigbaum 13 Arizona 237 (1910) involved a taxpayer challenge to how an election authorizing the issuance of school bonds had been conducted while Boudreaux v. Tucson, Gas, Electric Light and Power Company, 13 Arizona 361 (1911) was a wrongful death case. In Arizona Power Company v. Racine-Sattley Company, 13 Arizona 283 (1911), the plaintiff had ordered some wagons and they were delivered 15 days late. Lewis found the defendant's liability was limited as he had not prior information on the level of damages the late delivery would produce. In Agard v. Scott 13 Arizona 165 (1910), Lewis determined the cost of hiring a watchman could be included when calculating the assessed value of a mining property for tax purposes. Lewis's time on the bench ended with Arizona statehood on February 14, 1912. He returned to his private practice in Phoenix where he specialized in mining law and water rights. He represented a group of mining companies during a series of strikes that began in 1915. Two years later he was appointed by Woodrow Wilson to a Presidential Mediation Commission with the purpose of ending the strikes and labor unrest that were affecting the copper industry. Death Lewis died on April 3, 1927. His body was cremated following funeral services at Phoenix's Trinity Cathedral.

It was finished in 1904. A year later, he wrote a version for piano and orchestra. The catalogue number of this composition is Op. 1, Sz. 26. The initial full-length composition for piano eventually received a catalogue number BB 36a, whereas the second version, with piano and orchestra, received a catalogue number BB 36b.  Composition  The Rhapsody for piano was a very important work, especially for the fact that it was at that time when Bart√≥k decided to begin his third list of compositions. In this stage, he decided to embark on a new period in his artistic career where he would mainly explore folk music from Romania and Hungary. This turned out to be the pivotal work from which he developed a new direction for both his compositional style and his preoccupations as an artist. The Rhapsody was completed in late 1904 and was dedicated to Emma Gruber, who later became the wife of Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. Drafts for the composition are not extant. The virtuoso piano writing of the work's \\"elaborate textures and sectional contrasts\\" relates to the model of Franz Liszt. After five revisions and updates, Bart√≥k also released a version for piano and orchestra in 1905 and a version for two pianos. In 1907, Bart√≥k also composed a fourth version of the same piece, which was shortened by almost half of the total length of the composition.  Structure  The composition is in one movement and takes 21 minutes to perform, even though the shortened version takes only half of the total duration. Critics have frequently stated that the loose structure calls for two contrasting sections; however, it is not marked as such in the score. According to some critics, Bart√≥k used a Lisztian style, with very elaborate and vast chords and long and vastly ornamented scales and arpeggios. The composition starts with a fourteen-minute Adagio molto, which goes on to a second section, marked Poco allegretto.  Reception  When Bart√≥k decided to submit the composition as an entry in the composers' category of the Anton Rubinstein Competition in Paris, 1905, it received no official recognition. Critics have acknowledged that this was a first step for his later compositions. Critics have also praised the Lisztian character of the composition, even though the style that he would later develop is diluted. Reviewer Michael Morrison said: \\"This Rhapsody must be assessed as a finely crafted but derivative effort, whose length may not be fully justified\\".

Doe (January 20, 1850July 27, 1919) was an American jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court from 1909 till Arizona statehood in 1912. Biography Doe was born to Dr. John and Lemira (Damon) Doe in Cabot, Vermont on January 20, 1850. During the early 1850s, his family moved to Iowa City, Iowa. Doe was educated in local schools before graduating from the State University of Iowa (now University of Iowa) in 1870. He received a Doctor of law from the same institution in 1871. Doe was admitted to the Iowa bar the same year he received his law degree and practiced law in Iowa City. On June 5, 1884, Doe married Lida Young. Fraternally, he was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. In 1885, Doe moved to Fort Worth, Texas. Two years later he moved to Prescott, Arizona Territory and formed a law partnership with W. G. Stewart. In Prescott, Doe quickly became a leader in the territorial bar association. With the creation of Coconino county in 1891, Governor John N. Irwin appointed Doe the county's first district attorney. The next year he was elected to a full term. Doe was narrowly defeated by Henry F. Ashurst in the 1904 and 1906 elections for the office. He was elected to another term as district attorney in 1908. President William Howard Taft nominated Doe to replace Richard E. Sloan as an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on May 8, 1909. He received Senate confirmation on May 18 and was assigned to the fourth district, covering Apache, Coconino, Mohave, Navajo, and Yavapai counties. During his time on the territorial supreme court, Doe authored twelve opinions. His most influential opinion was in Shannon Copper Company v. Svendsen, 13 Arizona 111 (1910) which provided a precedent in matters dealing with corporations, contracts, and procedure. Three of his opinions dealt with criminal matters. He upheld murder convictions in Marquez v. Territory of Arizona, 13 Arizona 135 (1910) and Sharp v. Territory of Arizona, 13 Arizona 416 (1911). Schmidt v. Territory of Arizona, 13 Arizona 77 (1910) dealt with a gambling conviction. Railroads were a theme in several of Doe's decisions. Kroeger v. The Twin Buttes Railroad Company, 13 Arizona 348 (1911) dealt with the railroad's liability after a culvert they had built allegedly contributed to flooded which had damaged the plaintiff's property. In Southern Pacific Railroad c. Svendsen, 13 Arizona 111 (1910), the plaintiff claimed and was awarded damages for being thrown off a moving freight train. Cochchin v. El Paso & Southwestern Railroad Company, 13 Arizona 259 (1910) involved questions over the company's responsibilities for a watchman who was injured on the job. In other matters, Doe dealt with a bail request for an individual undergoing deportation proceedings under the Chinese Exclusion Act in Jung Goon Jow v. United States, 13 Arizona 255 (1910). Barnes v. Shattuck et al., 13 Arizona 338 (1911) began when former Justice William H. Barnes's widow attempted to collect legal fees owed to her late husband. The case eventually expanded to include the widow of former Chief Justice Webster Street who was in a similar position of attempting to collect unpaid legal fees. In Olney v. Bishop, 13 Arizona 336 (1911), Doe joined with the other members of the court in determining the court's practice of using a persons initials instead of their given name was acceptable but not ideal. Politically, Doe was elected to represent Coconino County in Arizona's 1910 constitutional convention. He was a Republican candidate for a seat on the Arizona Supreme Court but failed to win a seat. Doe's time on the bench ended with Arizona statehood on February 14, 1912. After leaving office, he returned to his private legal practice. His clients included the Arizona Central Bank, Babbitt Bros., the Saginaw & Manistee Lumber Company, and the Santa Fe Railroad. Doe died at his home on July 27, 1919. He was buried in Flagstaff's Citizens Cemetery.

Tibet within the Qing dynasty in 1820. The patron and priest relationship, also simply written as priest-patron or cho-yon (; ) is the symbolic relationship between a religious figure and a lay patron in the Tibetan ideology or political theory. \\"ch√∂y√∂n\\" is an abbreviation of two words: ch√∂ney, \\"that which is worthy of being given gifts and alms\\" (for example, a lama or a deity), and y√∂ndag, \\"he who gives gifts to that which is worthy\\" (a patron). This concept has been used by, for example, the 13th Dalai Lama to describe the relationship between Tibetan lamas and Mongol khans or Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty. According to this concept, in the case of Yuan rule of Tibet in the 13th and 14th centuries, Tibetan Lamas provided religious instruction; performed rites, divination and astrology, and offered the khan flattering religious titles like \\"protector of religion\\" or \\"religious king\\"; the khan (Kublai and his successors), in turn, protected and advanced the interests of the \\"priest\\" (\\"lama\\"). The lamas also made effective regents through whom the Mongols ruled Tibet.\\"The Snow Lion and the Dragon: China, Tibet, and the Dalai Lama\\" by Melvyn C. Goldstein, p3 Also in the case of Qing rule of Tibet, for those who espouse the idea, the Dalai Lama and the Manchu emperor stood respectively as spiritual teacher and lay patron rather than subject and lord. Nevertheless, according to Elliot Sperling, an expert on the history of Tibet and Tibetan- Chinese relations at Indiana University, the Tibetan concept of a \\"priest- patron\\" religious relationship governing Sino-Tibetan relations to the exclusion of concrete political subordination is itself a rather recent construction. He writes that the patron and priest relationship coexisted with Tibet's political subordination to the Yuan and Qing dynasties.\\"The Tibet- China Conflict: History and Polemics\\" by Elliot Sperling, p30 During the 1913 Simla Conference, the 13th Dalai Lama's negotiators used the \\"priest and patron relationship\\" as a rhetorical device to explain the lack of any clearly demarcated boundary between Tibet and the rest of China (as a religious benefactor, the Qing did not need to be hedged against).Chang, Simon T. \\"A ‚Äòrealist‚Äô hypocrisy?

It is inserted between the bra and the breast. Disposable pads are common and located easily online or in specialty stores. Reusable cloth pads can be washed and used over. These may be less expensive. Changing the pad when it is wet will keep the nipple clean and dry.http://www.parents.com/baby/breastfeeding/problems/breastfeeding-soothing- solutions/  Types  Nursing pads or breast pads come in different shapes and sizes and can be disposable or reusable. They can be contoured to the shape of one's breast or come with adhesive tape to hold the pad in place. There are five types of nursing pads: disposable, reusable, homemade, silicone and hydrogel.  Disposable  Disposable nursing pads are single use pads that are discarded later. They come in various shapes and sizes and also differ in thickness. They have lining of plastic inside them to prevent leakage. They are convenient and best-suited for travel since they do not need to be washed. However, they can be expensive in the long run and are not eco- friendly. Disposable pads also retain moisture when worn for a long period and cause nipple soreness. It is advised to change them often.  Reusable  Reusable nursing pads are made of fabric and come in various shapes, sizes and thickness. They are eco-friendly and cost-effective in the long run. They are washable both by hand or machine. However, it is important to make sure that one has bought multiple pads when the soiled ones are in laundry. However, some women complained that reusable nursing pads often shift.  Homemade  Nursing pads can be easily made at home using disposable sanitary napkins or diapers. They can also be made using soft fabric, handkerchief or cotton material. Homemade nursing pads should be cut out in a circular shape and a few layers should be stitched together to make it leakproof and fit inside the bra. Avoid using artificial material and use soft cotton fabrics so that it is not irritable against the skin.  Silicone nursing pads  Silicone nursing pads are made of medical grade soft silicone. They are not absorbent, but they put gentle pressure on a breast to avoid leakage. They have a sticky surface that adheres directly to the breast. They can be worn with or without a bra and are quite thin. They can also be worn under sheer evening gowns and swimwear. However, some women may find silicone nursing pads irritable due to increased skin sensitivity around the breast area during post-partum and breastfeeding.  Hydrogel  Hydrogel nursing pads are not used for preventing leakage, but they are used to heal irritation and soreness around the nipple. These pads can be stored in a freezer and later used to provide relief to the breasts.

The library opened in its current location in 1968 and was renovated in 2002.Hopkins Library http://www.hclib.org/about/locations/hopkins The library joined Hennepin County Library in 1973. The Beginnings In 1910, the population of the Village of West Minneapolis, as Hopkins was first called, was 3,022. But the settlement was bustling: The Minneapolis Threshing Machine Company, which moved to the village in 1887, was manufacturing harvest equipment for farmers throughout the western prairie; the raspberry farms were thriving‚Äîand bars, churches, banks and other businesses were sprouting up everywhere. But something was missing from the village: There wasn't a library. In 1912, The Women's Improvement League , led by Mrs. W.B. Anderson, convinced city officials that space for a library should be set aside in the newly built city hall building on 8th and Excelsior Avenue (now Main Street). Three rooms were reserved, and soon the league and Hopkins high alumni stocked books, organized shelves and began children's story hours. The first librarian of this volunteer-based library was Lillian Wheeler. By 1915, the village had budgeted $700 a year to fund this young library, and there were some 800 books on the shelves. About 458 were checked out each month and, in just three years, 1,050 library cards were issued. Children's story hours were put on by the League with up to 175 children attending. Along with donated and purchased English language books, a collection of 1,200 Czech language books were donated by the Western Bohemian Fraternal Association of Glen Lake. This was very helpful for the large population of Czechoslovakians that immigrated to Hopkins to work for the threshing machine company, in the raspberry fields and for businesses opening in the village. The Czech-language books were a source of pride for the immigrants, as well as a reminder of their Bohemian heritage. The Merger Controversy, Part 1 In 1931, a lively debate was sparked in Hopkins over whether the city library should merge with the Hennepin County Library system. The county system was formed just after the Hopkins Library opened, and it was the only suburban library that still was independent. According to The Hennepin County Review circa 1931, the Hopkins Village Council spent many hours hearing debate on the issue. The meetings were long and heavily attended; the citizenry was very invested in the outcome. Those opposed objected to higher taxes as well as the loss of control: they wanted the autonomy to stock the titles they wanted, notably the Czech books. Those in favor supported the merger for expanded access to reference books for local schools, which were provided by the county‚Äîas well as for greater resources for local students. The Library Board voted in mid-March to approve the merger by a vote of 8-1. Mayor Hagen commissioned the village council to study the measure‚Äîand ultimately, the village council rejected it on a 3-2 vote. At the next meeting, Miss Lindborg, principal at the Harley Hopkins School, expressed great regret at losing the service of the county system. Its loss, she pointed out, would greatly limit reference reading, because without the support of county funding the city simply couldn't stock as many volumes. Finally, on April 28, the village council opted to let the public decide the matter‚Äîand set a special election for May 23, 1931. The two sides squared off respectively in The Hennepin County Review and The Minneapolis Journal‚Äîand the factions were equally passionate in their viewpoints. But perhaps the most compelling arguments came from The Hopkins Taxpayers League, formed specifically to oppose the merger. The league argued in The Hennepin County Review that increased county taxes would be burdensome and strongly objected to ‚Äúoutside‚Äù entities controlling town-owned assets. They even went so far as to point out that Hennepin County, at that time, had no board‚Äîand therefore would have no governance. The argument turned personal when the league questioned Mayor Hagen's loyalty to the village, pointing out that previous mayors had ‚Äúdeemed it disloyal to consider giving away the Hopkins Library.‚Äù But supporters of the merger countered with a full-page Journal article pointing out that the amount paid to the county would actually be $150 less than what was budgeted by the village. They also pointed out that the collection would remain in Hopkins‚Äîbut that the public would now have access, as well, to an additional half-million books through an inter-library loan from the Hennepin County and Minneapolis systems. Finally, they assured readers that the current collection of books in the Czech language would remain at the library. On May 23, the special election was held. Turnout was heavy; emotions ran high‚Äîand when the polling place opened its doors, a line of voters stretched down the block. When all was said and done, the measure was defeated 501-411 and Hopkins kept its independent status‚Äîwhich the city would continue to do for more than 40 years. Soon after the election, a name many local residents still recognize became an indelible part of Hopkins history. In 1932, Bloomie Mountain was hired as head librarian of the Hopkins Library. By all accounts a tough, no-nonsense person intolerant of mischief in her library, Miss Mountain was nonetheless a legend: beloved by children and adults alike. A staunch advocate of keeping the library for Hopkins people only, she made sure non-residents paid a fee for a library card. Meticulous with details, she made questionable cardholders prove their homes were in Hopkins‚Äîby insisting they show her where they lived on the road map she had hanging behind the reference desk at the Dow House. Bloomie coordinated the move to the Dow House in 1948, and put her own stamp on the new library. She was complimented for her homey and creative touches throughout the building; she converted the mansion's butler's pantry‚Äîwhich included a dumbwaiter and sink‚Äîinto her office. During Bloomie's tenure, a new children's and young adult section was opened, and library patrons fondly recall bringing their children to check out new books and picnic on the grounds at Dow House Park. Bloomie loved the library and was responsible for many improvements during her 29-year tenure. She bought more than 28,000 books: when she retired in 1963, there were more than 10,000 non-fiction volumes in Hopkins‚Äô collection; when she began her career in 1932, there were only 3,600 books total. She also organized the books into a more coherent cataloguing system. In an article about her retirement, she said, \\"When I took the job there was no filing system or catalogue ‚Äì just shelves of books. I spent a year organizing the first file...and I almost gave up three different times.‚Äù But despite her love of the library, Bloomie Mountain had looked forward to renewing friendships and traveling to Rome after retirement but, unfortunately, it was not to be. She died soon after she quit working, in June 1963, at 73. Her portrait hung in the library for decades and is now at the Hopkins Historical Society. For 31 years, Bloomie defined the library‚Äîand she embodied the spunk and pioneer spirit still prevalent in Hopkins today. The Dow House While Hopkins Library was located at the Dow House it was popular with children. Hopkins Library staff working at the customer service desk at the Dow House. In the late 1940s, it became clear that the three rooms in the back of the city hall were no longer adequate to house the expanding collection. Hopkins had grown and the village officially became a city in 1947. The City Council considered letting the library use the meeting hall in the same building, but then an opportunity arose that solved two problems. The Dow House was built in 1894 by Daniel and Belinda Dow. After marrying in 1855, they owned 160 acres and ran a prosperous farm. Portions of their land were ultimately sold both to the railroad and The Minneapolis Threshing Machine Company for a tidy profit‚Äîand they used the proceeds to build a beautiful 15-room mansion (land now occupied by the post office) at 9th and First Street South. The Dow family lived in the house until the 1930s when Llewellyn Dow, son of Daniel and Belinda, sold the house to the city for $4,300 in 1935. The house was used for various purposes after that, including rental offices for The Minneapolis Threshing Machine Company (now Minneapolis Moline). At the same time that the library was looking for new space, the Moline Company was in negotiations to purchase the Dow House from the City of Hopkins. Articles in The Hennepin County Review between September and October 1947 reported a lack of communication between the council and Moline officials. At the Sept. 2 meeting, the Moline sent a letter asking if the city would like to sell the building, and if so, for how much? An appraisal had been done earlier that valued the house at $19,000. But during the course of the meeting, a motion was passed to order the Moline to vacate the Dow House by Nov. 1. Why this motion passed is not entirely clear. The Minneapolis Moline Company had rented the first floor from the city for three years, and had expressed interest in purchasing a year earlier. No mention was made about the Moline being bad tenants. There could have been concern if the company bought the house it would be torn down to build a new office building. What seems clear was that communication between the city and the company was strained, and both sides grew weary of the protracted negotiation process. So when the library needed new space, the Dow House seemed to be the perfect fit. At Oct. 7 meeting, members of the library board, headed by Joseph Vesely, said the move was mandatory because the library was bursting at the seams; there were so many books mashed on the crowded shelves there was no room to read. He pointed out that in 1947, an amazing 1,917 people visited the library and 19,000 books were loaned in the cramped quarters; the only solution, he argued, was to move to the more spacious Dow House. At this same meeting, M.B. Hagen, representing The Civic and Commerce Association, pointed out that selling the house to Minneapolis Moline would make good business sense. Moline, he said, was in desperate need of office space, and moreover the risk of losing a cornerstone of the city was not worth taking. Hagen also argued that the Dow House was not an adequate facility for the library. When it came time to vote, the council sided with Vesely and moved the library to the Dow House; the city asked the Moline to vacate the premises by Jan. 1, 1948. But the debate had not yet cooled. At the next meeting, on Oct. 21, an official offer came in from Minneapolis Moline to purchase the house for $15,000. However, this offer was rejected‚Äîand the library officially moved into their new home in early 1948. Many people living today remember the Dow House, home of the Hopkins Library for 15 years, as the charming library of their youth and young adulthood. They have colorful memories of walking from room to room to find the book they sought, of two large fireplaces on each side of the south parlor, of the large staircase that spiraled up to the children's section. Circulation, Reference, Fiction and Non-Fiction were all on the first floor; in the dining room the shelves were so tall and over-burdened with books that the public wasn't allowed into the section: If you wanted a non-fiction book, you had to fill out a slip and the librarian would get the item for you. In the warmer months, people would bring their families, picnic on the grounds and read books from the library. The New Building and Merger Part 2 In the 1960s, the movement for accessibility made the Dow House no longer an ideal location for a library. The building was not specifically built to house the weight of books and book shelves. There was concern about the safety of the library‚Äîafter housing the heavy book collection for 15 years‚Äîand in 1962 a comprehensive study was commissioned to find out what amenities were desired by the community. It was determined that the library was inadequate to serve the community, so change was necessary. In 1963, a new temporary location was found at what became Bridgeman's at 9th Street North and Mainstreet (now Law Offices). David Smith was the library director at the time, and he remembers hauling the entire collection of books to the new location in the heat of the summer, including at least one trip in a large dump truck. When they began moving in, the shelving hadn't been delivered, so they created temporary stacks from cement blocks and planks, which had been donated by Justus Lumber. Various community organizations also donated furniture and other items to the new library. While at the temporary location, a new library was planned, but it soon became clear that funding would be tight. At the time there was a federal grant program set up to encourage public libraries to flourish; conditions included a mandate that the building had to serve as a library for 20 years and that the city also had to contribute funds to the project. There were a few twists and turns, but finally the grant came through, and in 1968 the Hopkins Library was built where it stands today: at 22 11th Ave. North. Besides Minneapolis, Hopkins remained the final independent library in the county. After the survey found enhancements were needed, the city doubled funding for the library. Soon after the library moved opened in its new location the possibility of merging with Hennepin County Library was an option. A packed community meeting was held in 1970 to discuss the possibility of a merger and although there was still some resistance, the merger passed, and in 1973 the Hopkins Library became a member of the Hennepin County Library System. There remained in the collection some 1,000 books in Czech. The community had held on to these books even though most Hopkins residents no longer could read Czech or speak the language. Finally in the 1990s, they were donated first to The Hopkins History Center and then to the University of Minnesota Immigration Research Center, where to this day they are a valuable resource in the study of Czechoslovakia. In 2002, the Hopkins library closed for nine months to undergo a significant remodeling that resulted in a more efficient floor plan, more computers and overall better customer service. A new layout, fixtures, art and an enhanced library environment overall complemented other redevelopment projects on Main Street. Since then, further improvements have been made, including an expanded teen area as well as a lounge along the front windows. In August 2010 a new early literacy play area called ‚ÄúMainstreet‚Äù was specifically designed and built for the Hopkins Library by the Minnesota Children's Museum. Historically, The Friends of the Hopkins Library have played a key role in supporting the library. Membership dues and funds from Friends' book sales have bought new furnishings, books for young readers, beautiful stained glass and year-round programs for all ages.Kaspar, Kristin. ‚ÄúHistory of Hopkins Library, 1912-2012,‚Äù Friends of the Hopkins Library, 2012.

Boulder, Colorado, 1978. Throwing sports, or throwing games, are physical, human competitions where the outcome is measured by a player's ability to throw an object. The two primary forms are throwing for distance and throwing at a given target or range. The four most prominent throwing for distance sports are in track and field: shot put, discus, javelin, and the hammer throw. Target-based sports have two main genres: bowling and darts, each of which have a great number of variations. History Throwing sports have a long history. Modern track and field comes from a lineage of activities that dates to the Ancient Olympic Games. Artwork from Ancient Greece, in the form of friezes, pottery and statues, attests to the prominence of such sports in the society's physical culture.Rosenbaum, Mike.

The game of catch (throwing and catching an object between players) is among the most basic of all games and is a key component of many modern, complex sports and games. Its dodgeball variant is a basic throwing game where the opponent is the target.Dodgeball. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved on 2015-03-16. Projectiles used in such sports are highly varied. Common projectile types include balls, darts, sticks, discs and rings. Formalised throwing sports often have strictly defined criteria for projectiles, such as a pre-determined size and weight.IAAF CERTIFICATES - Certified Competition Throwing Implements. IAAF (2015).

Less formalised games are usually not as strict and some games (for example, pitching pennies and horseshoes) incorporate everyday objects into the game, reflecting the simplistic roots of the pastimes. Most throwing sports use a defined field of play (including an area players may throw an object from, and an area where the object should fall) and a specific throwing method. Common one-armed throwing methods include overhand throwing (releasing with the arm above the shoulder) and underarm throwing (releasing with the arm below the shoulder). With both arms, overhead throwing and chest-passing are common actions.Fontenot, Andrew. Four Types of Ball Throws (blacklisted link). EHow. Retrieved on 2015-03-16. The type of throw used is highly influenced by the properties of the projectile: small, heavy objects are held and pushed away from the body (e.g. shot put); handled objects are swung and released with one or two hands (e.g. weight throw, keg toss);Keg Toss. Bodybuilding. Retrieved on 2015-03-16.Weight throw. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved on 2015-03-16. smaller, lighter objects such as balls and darts tend to use an extended overarm technique where distance or speed is required, and an underarm technique where greater precision is required. In these sports, most throws are taken from a static position or limited area. However, some sports do include a short run-up to the throw line, for example javelin throw and ten-pin bowling.Javelin.

In a TEDtalk in 2011, Martin brings up the issues of wealth disparity, xenophobia, environmental crisis, and sex trafficking and states ‚Äúit‚Äôs enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.‚Äù Another differentiating factor influencing the gap between second and third-wave feminism that Martin discusses is how they approach political activism. Her opinion is that second- wavers typically organize protest marches in order to create change, while third-wavers have turned to ‚Äúonline organizing.‚Äù Using social media, online petitions, and blogs to raise awareness about feminist issues and social issues in general, as well as to bring about change, is a viable strategy that Martin argues could be the future of feminism.

Biography After spending her childhood in Morocco and a short stay at the Lyc√©e Chateaubriand in Rome (Chateaubriand High School in Rome), the young Martine Sitbon returned to Paris in the early 1960s with her family. In the early 1970s, Sitbon entered the Studio Ber√ßot in Paris where she studied until 1974. Her appeal for traveling made her work as a freelance designer for various fashion houses around the world. She designed collections in India and Hong-Kong from 1976 to 1980. In the early 1980s until 1985, Sitbon mainly worked between New York and Paris. Between 1984 and 1986, she designed collections in Milan as a freelance designer for Italian fashion houses. In Milan, Italian investors that had already launched the designer Romeo Gigli and who were scouting new designers to financially aid noticed her. This allowed Sitbon to present her very first fashion show in 1986 in Paris. In 1987, she was invited to present her first collection within the Cour Carr√©e du Louvre during Paris Fashion Week. That same season, she was invited to present a fashion show at the Palladium in New York City. That same year, Sitbon collaborated with the photographer Javier Vallhonrat and the artistic director Marc Ascoli in order to create catalogues, the visual identity and advertising campaigns for her brand. This collaboration lasted five seasons. In 1988, she was appointed Creative Director in the luxury ready-to-wear French fashion house Chlo√©. She designed the collections during nine seasons in parallel to working for her own brand, Martine Sitbon. Sitbon's arrival happened during a time when Chlo√© was declining and smelled of dust. With Sitbon, the Chlo√© fashion house got a breath of fresh air: a strong visual identity incarnated by the supermodels of the time: Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen... \\"Chlo√© had this thing where they began to pick up young designers and they carried on. I think it's really become part of the Chlo√© heritage‚Ä¶I was the first young girl to be a named designer for the house. And for me it was an incredible experience.\\" (Martine Sitbon, interview with Sarah Mower, November 2012) In 1990, Sitbon began collaborating with English photographer Nick Knight and Ascoli for the visual identity, the creation of the catalogues and the advertising image of her own brand. In 1993, she opened a new showroom in the Marais neighbourhood in Paris, 6 rue de Braque. In 1996, Sitbon inaugurated her first store rue de Grenelle in a venue of over 200 square meters. She collaborated with graphic designers M/M Paris (Micha√´l Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak) for the conception of the logo, the graphic identity and the invitations of the fashion house during eight seasons. Her style, which mixed a \\"rock attitude\\", Parisian chic and romanticism later named \\"rock'n'romantic\\", collected a faithful clientele. In 1997, Ascoli, M/M Paris, and Craig McDean were responsible for creating the autumn/winter 1997/98 collection catalogue. That same year, Sitbon was made Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres (Knight of Arts and Literature) by the French government. In 1998, she presented her autumn/winter 1998/99 collection during Tokyo Fashion Week at Tokyo Garden Hall in partnership with Onward Kashiyama. In 1999, Sitbon launched her men's collection simultaneously with the womenswear. In 2000, she was made \\"President of the jury for Young Designers\\" during the International fashion and fashion photography festival in Hy√®res. During the festival, she presented an exhibition of her own work including a video of Jean-Baptiste Mondino featuring model Kirsten Owen. In 2001, she opened a Martine Sitbon boutique in Seoul, South Korea. That same year, and for just one year, Sitbon became Head Designer for Italian Women's ready-to-wear fashion house, Byblos. In 2002, she collaborated with Ascoli and photographer Vanina Sorrenti during three seasons for the Martine Sitbon brand. In 2003, she collaborated with Ascoli and Serge Leblon for the 2003/04 autumn/winter collection. In 2004, the Martine Sitbon label presented its last fashion show in the Matisse room of the Mus√©e des Arts Modernes de la Ville de Paris (Museum of Modern Arts of Paris). In 2004, Sitbon encountered financial difficulties that would lead her to close her studio, her boutique and her label. She subsequently lost the commercial use of her name. In 2006, she launched the brand Rue du Mail along with Sino-Canadian investor Jimmy K.W. Chan (CEO of Semeiotics Inc). Chan became the founder and CEO of Rue du Mail, and Sitbon its Head and founding Designer. In 2007, the Rue du Mail label opened its headquarters, named after the street where the brand's premises and head office are at, 5 rue du Mail on the right bank of Paris. The boutique, located in the same place as the studio, the showroom and the administrative office, was inaugurated in 2007; a gallery-like space of 700 square meters that gathered and put into sync all of the brand's activities. The boutique Rue du Mail opened in September 2007. The first fashion show of the new label Rue du Mail took place at the Couvent des Cordeliers during the autumn/winter 2007/08 Fashion Week in Paris. In June 2007, Sitbon curated issue number 5 of A Magazine. She was the first woman invited by the issue after Martin Margiela, Yohji Yamamoto, Haider Ackermann, and Undercover (Jun Takahashi) to be its chief editor. Sitbon brought together different artists and friends for this issue: Knight, McDean, M/M Paris, Andr√©e Putman, Anna Sui, Anita Pallenberg, Sofia Coppola, Marie Rucki, Tilda Swinton, C√©dric Rivrain, Fr√©d√©ric Sanchez, Jimmy Dine, Annette Messager, and Paul McCarthy. In 2008, Rue du Mail presented its collection at the √âcole Nationale des Beaux Arts de Paris (National School of Fine Arts in Paris). In 2009, the label had its runway show for the second time at the Couvent des Cordeliers. However, from 2010 until 2013, Rue du Mail hosted its runway shows in its own headquarters. In May 2012 Sitbon was named Chevalier de l'Ordre National du M√©rite (Knight of the National Order of Merit) by the French government. In 2013, Rue du Mail decided to suspend their activities until further notice. In 2014, Sitbon sponsored the master's degree of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture parisienne (French Federation of Couture School). Also in 2014, Sitbon created all the uniforms for the Pullman Hotels in the scope of their repositioning towards high-end hospitality and their new development strategy. Sitbon's designs in her name as well as for the Rue du Mail label have been worn by many leading figures namely Cate Blanchett, Karin Viard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kirsten Dunst, Scarlett Johansson, Vanessa Paradis, Emma Stone, Cl√©mence Po√©sy and Swinton, who have all been seduced by her creations.

After the war, he fell into disfavour and died in obscurity in exile in Prague.  Life  The eldest of four children, Tzimas was born to the family of Dimitrios Tzimas, a Vlach jurist and lawyer from Samarina. His mother, Ourania Alvanou, came from Moschopolis in what is now Albania. Born in Kastoria, Tzimas spent his first years in Skopje, where his father had moved, until the Balkan Wars led the family to relocate once more to Kastoria, which now had passed from the Ottoman Empire to the Kingdom of Greece. Despite his father's conservative and royalist tendencies‚Äîhe even served briefly as an MP with Ioannis Metaxas' Freethinkers' Party in 1926‚Äì28‚Äîthe young Andreas swiftly turned to the nascent Communist Party of Greece (KKE), leading to his expulsion from his law studies in the University of Athens in 1929. He returned to his home town of Kastoria, and performed his military service in 1930. Although as the eldest in a family of four sons he was slated for only four months service, eventually he remained in the army for ten, having \\"earned\\" six months from disciplinary punishments due to his political alignment. In 1931 he was arrested under the idionymon law, and spent one and half years at the feared Heptapyrgion prison and a year in internal exile on Gavdos (until February 1934). There he met among others Thanasis Klaras, the future Aris Velouchiotis. In 1934 he was sent to Moscow for higher studies. Following his return he was active in the party organization in Athens, until elected as an MP in the January 1936 election. His father had died a few days earlier. Following the establishment of the dictatorial and fanatically anti-communist 4th of August Regime under Ioannis Metaxas in 1936, the entire Communist Party went underground. Tzimas remained active in the region of Western Thrace, managing to remain at large until his arrest in April 1939. He was imprisoned in the Akronauplia prison, where he remained until after the German invasion of Greece. He was released by the new German authorities on 1 July 1941 due to the intervention of the Bulgarian government, which sought the release of any prisoners of Slavic Macedonian descent, who were deemed to be pro-Bulgarian. Although not a Slavic Macedonian himself, Tzimas spoke the language, and managed to be released as well (along with a few others like him). With so many leading members imprisoned, Tzimas rapidly advanced in the hierarchy of the newly reconstituted party: almost immediately he became a Central Committee member, and in January 1942 he became an alternate member of the KKE's Politburo. From August 1941 until March 1942 he was first secretary of the prestigious Athens Party Organization (KOA), and played a major role in the establishment of the National Liberation Front (EAM) in September 1941 and in KKE's decision to launch an armed guerrilla campaign, leading to the establishment of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). While the KKE leadership clung to orthodox communist doctrine emphasizing the importance of the capital, Tzimas was the leading proponent of having members of KKE leadership move to the countryside, actively promote both the guerrilla campaign and the initiatives to establish \\"people's power\\" (laokratia) there. On 2 May 1943, his proposals for the creation of an ELAS high command were adopted by KKE and EAM. From then on, along with the \\"chief captain\\" Aris Velouchiotis and the senior military commander, Stefanos Sarafis, Tzimas formed the leading triumvirate of ELAS, with the nom de guerre of \\"Vasilis Samariniotis\\" (after his father's home town). He favoured close co-operation with Tito's Yugoslav Partisans, even supporting the establishment of a common Balkan partisan headquarters, without success. In October 1943 he was sent as part of the first EAM delegation to Cairo for talks with the British and the royal Greek government in exile, and after December 1943 served as ELAS' liaison with Tito. In the April 1944 elections held across \\"Free Greece\\", he was elected as a representative of the \\"National Council\\", the legislative assembly established by EAM. Despite his distinguished role in the Greek Resistance, after liberation he fell into disfavour with the party establishment: his failure to be elected to the Central Committee in 1945 was followed by his arrest and exile to Ikaria. Although he escaped in 1947 and joined the fight of the KKE-backed Democratic Army of Greece in the ongoing Greek Civil War, he remained on the sidelines. After the KKE's defeat in the civil war, he and his family went to Hungary, and then to Czechoslovakia, where he died in obscurity in 1972.

His quest takes him to the small village of Archer Trace, where he interrogates an innkeeper about the whereabouts of Eldra Darrivanian. Eldra is an elf who worked for the Elessedil Royal family as a historian that specialized in genealogy. After his son was killed under mysterious circumstances while serving in the Home Guard, Eldra felt the king did not do enough to discover who the killer was and bring him to justice. He then began neglecting and sabotaging his work, and eventually was dismissed. In disgrace, he left Arborlon with his wife and went into hiding near Archer Trace. After tracking him down, Allanon questions him as to whom the last heir of Shannara is and Eldra tells him that it is a man named Weir. Allanon travels to Weir's home, and wonders about Eldra's strange behavior. He seemed tense and afraid. When he arrives at Weir's home he is attacked and takes a dagger to the chest, but using Druid magic he is able to kill most of his attackers, while the rest flee. During the assault, Allanon uses one of his attackers as a human shield. The man is pierced and killed by arrows. Afterwards, a Skull Bearer reveals himself long enough to tell Allanon that the man he used as a human shield was Weir, last heir of Shannara. Allanon retreats to the home of friends where he is healed of his wounds by medicine and magic, then returns to the home of Eldra. Eldra seems relieved to see him, and Allanon immediately knows he didn't expect him to survive. Eldra confesses that he had been ordered by the Skull Bearer to set Allanon up. The Skull Bearer had been in his bedroom during Allanon's visit, and had threatened to murder his wife if he didn't tell Allanon exactly what he was told. The Warlock Lord not only wanted Shannara's last heir dead, but he wanted him dead by Allanon's hand as revenge for Bremen casting him out of the Druid Keep. He wanted Allanon to know that he was responsible for the death of the Four Lands' last hope. Eldra reveals, however, that Weir was an evil man that allied himself to the Warlock Lord, and would have been no help anyway. He also reveals that Weir was not the last heir of Shannara. Aren Shea is. He has just reached manhood, and now goes by Shea Ohmsford. Shea's parents were murdered mysteriously, so Eldra and his wife hid the boy and later left him in the care of the Ohmsfords. Eldra then takes his own life to protect this secret from the Skull Bearers and to protect his wife, knowing that the Skull Bearers won't bother with her if he is dead. Allanon sets off to find Shea.

Its companies saw action in both World Wars, particularly at the Battle of Rosi√®res and the assault crossing of the River Selle in 1918, and on D-Day in 1944. Its successors continue to serve in today's Army Reserve. Early history The 1st Newcastle Engineer Volunteers (EV) was raised at company strength in Newcastle upon Tyne during the enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement engendered by the invasion scare of 1859; its first officers' commissions were dated 1 September 1860.Beckett, Appendix IX.Army List. Many early volunteers came from Armstrong's engineering works at Elswick.Short et al., p. 1. The company was attached for administrative purposes to the 1st Newcastle upon Tyne Rifle Volunteer Corps.Westlake, p. 13. In 1874 the Newcastle company was united with the larger (8 companies) 1st Durham EV at Jarrow on the opposite (County Durham) bank of the River Tyne. This unit had been raised and commanded by Charles Palmer (1822‚Äì1907), founder of Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and later the first mayor and Member of Parliament for Jarrow.Burke's. The two units were formed into the 1st Durham Administrative Battalion EV, consolidated in 1880 as the 1st Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham EV, with Palmer as commanding officer and an establishment of 1300 men.Westlake, pp. 7 & 13.Short et al., p. 2. Palmer, by now created Sir Charles Palmer, 1st Baronet of Grinkle Park, retired from the unit in 1888 with the rank of Colonel. The same year, the 1st Newcastle & Durham EV was split into three separate units: the 1st Newcastle upon Tyne RE (Volunteers), the 1st Durham RE (V),Durham Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org and the Tyne Division RE (V), Submarine Miners, which later became the Tyne Electrical Engineers.Short et al, pp. 4‚Äì5.Westlake, p. 15.Tyne Electrical Engineers at Regiments.org Both the 1st Newcastle RE (V) and the Tyne Submarine Miners derived their seniority from the original 1st Newcastle EV established in 1860.80‚Äì117 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on. The Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the new 1st Newcastle RE was Sir Charles Palmer's younger brother, Alfred Septimus Palmer (1834‚Äì1910), a Newcastle mining engineer who had been a major in the 1st Newcastle & Durham EV.Alfred Septimus Palmer family tree and biography at Eric Palmer's Home Page, accessed 5/2/15 The honorary Colonel was William Henry Allinson (1827‚Äì1917), who had been second-in-command of the 1st Newcastle & Durham.William Henry Allinson family tree and biography at The Thompsons, Shipbuilders of Sunderland family website, accessed 5/2/15 The unit sent a detachment of one officer and 25 other ranks to assist the regular REs during the Second Boer War in 1900.Watson, p. 42. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the original plan was for the 1st Newcastle RE to provide the 2nd Northumbrian Field Company in the Northumbrian Infantry Division while the remainder of the unit would be merged into the Tyne Electrical Engineers as the Northumberland (Fortress) RE.London Gazette, 20 March 1908. However, by 1910 this plan had been altered, and the 1st Newcastle RE provided the whole of the divisional RE, with its commanding officer becoming Commanding Royal Engineer (CRE). This organisation was in place on the outbreak of World War I:London Gazette, 14 October 1910.Monthly Army List, August 1914.Lord & Watson, pp. 161‚Äì2.Wyrall, p. 3 & Appendix B.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 11.

The next day the order to mobilise was received, and they returned to their drill halls. The mobilised division garrisoned the Tyne Defences as part of Central Force of Home Defence, and began training for war.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 93‚Äì100.50 (Northumbrian) Division at Long, Long TrailWyrall, p. 4. On 31 August the TF was authorised to raise '2nd Line' units, initially for home defence, composed of men who had not volunteered for overseas service, together with new volunteers who were flooding in. Later, the home service men were transferred to home defence units, the 2nd Line were prepared for overseas service, and '3rd Line' units were organised to find drafts for the 1st and 2nd Lines. The units were distinguished by the prefixes '1/', '2/' and '3/', and the 2nd Line units of the Northumbrian Division formed the 2nd Northumbrian Division.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 49‚Äì54.63 (2nd Northumbrian) Division at Long, Long TrailWatson & Rinaldi, p. 67. 28th Division 1/1st Northumbrian Field Company left the Northumbrian Division on 26 December 1914 to join 28th Division forming at Winchester. This was a formation of Regular infantry battalions returned from India, with engineers, signals and medical services provided by Territorial companies. The company disembarked at Le Havre on 19 January 1915 and served with 28th Division in France for the first half of the year, including the battles of Gravenstafel Ridge (22‚Äì23 April), St Julien (24 April‚Äì4 May), Frezenberg Ridge (8‚Äì13 May) and Bellewarde Ridge (24‚Äì25 May).Watson & Rinaldi, p. 31.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 105‚Äì16. When 1/1st Northumbrian Field Company returned to the 1st Northumbrian Division, it was replaced by 2/1st Northumbrian Field Company from the 2nd Northumbrian Division, which joined 28th Division on 10 July 1915. For the remainder of the war 2/1st Company served with this division in France and Macedonia. In 1917 it was numbered 449th Field Company. It remained with 28th Division after the Armistice with Bulgaria (30 September 1918) and in November 1918 it moved to the Dardanelles with the Division. During 1919 it served in Turkey with 28th Division.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 59.Wyrall, pp. 89 & 359. Formation sign of 50th (Northumbrian) Division in World War I. 50th Division Early in April 1915, the Northumbrian Division was informed that it would shortly be sent to France, and on 16 April it began to entrain for the ports of embarkation (Southampton and Folkestone). The division completed its concentration in the vicinity of Steenvoorde on 23 April.Wyrall, p. 5. It was thrown into action the very next day at the Battle of St Julien, taking up positions along the Yser Canal and then counter- attacking. The infantry of the division were involved in bitter fighting.Wyrall, pp. 9‚Äì44. Meanwhile, the divisional engineers were left at Steenvorde, but from 26 April they were sent up each night to work on a new defence line near Hill 60, to which the division retired on the night of 2‚Äì3 May.Wyrall, pp. 42‚Äì8. The Northumberland Division was now made responsible for holding a section of the line and learnt the techniques of trench warfare in which the engineers were kept busy improving defences. Like the 28th Division, the Northumberland Division also fought through the battles of Frezenberg Ridge and Bellewarde Ridge, and again at Bellewarde on 16 June.Wyrall, pp. 48‚Äì86. It was then moved south into quieter sectors for the rest of 1915.Wyrall, pp. 86‚Äì100. Soon after arriving in France, the division received its number, becoming 50th (Northumbrian) Division, the brigades being numbered 149, 150 and 151, and the Signal Company numbered 50. 1/1st Northumbrian Field Company rejoined the division on 2 June 1915, and the divisional engineers were further reinforced on 17 June by 7th Field Company, RE, a Regular unit.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 35. 7th Field Company had landed in France with 4th Division on 22 August 1914, and had served through the Retreat from Mons, and the battles of the Marne, Aisne and Armenti√®res.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 59‚Äì62. It had been attached to 48th (South Midland) Division for a few weeks before joining 50th Division.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 41.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 79. 1916 50th Division moved back into the Ypres Salient in December 1915. This meant more intense trench warfare, with the divisional engineers and signallers constantly engaged in repairing defences and communications.Wyrall, pp. 100‚Äì134. In August 1916 the division was transferred to the Somme sector, moving into the line at Bazentin-le-Petit by 10 September, where it immediately began digging assembly and jumping-off trenches for a new phase of the Battle of the Somme.Wyrall, pp. 134, 138‚Äì42. This attack (the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette) opened on 15 September, with 50th Division attacking between High Wood and Martinpiuch. 7th Field Company with part of the pioneer battalion set to repairing the road towards Martinpuich, while 1/1st and 1/2nd Northumrian Field Companies were held in reserve around Railway Trench.Wyrall, p. 143. As the attack developed, by the afternoon of 15 September they were engaged in digging communication trenches, repairing roads and building gun emplacements under fire. This continued throughout the seven days of the battle, and casualties among the sappers were heavy.Wyrall, p. 160. The fighting was renewed on 25 September (the Battle of Morval) and 50th Division continued in action throughout October and into November (the battles of Le Transloy and Butte de Warlencourt). The division's last action on the Somme before being relieved was an attack on Gird Trench and Hook Sap on 14 November, which gained no ground. The division was withdrawn on the night of 17‚Äì18 November and went into Corps Reserve.Wyrall, pp. 161‚Äì91. 1917 ' When the TF engineer companies were numbered on 3 February 1917, 1/1st Northumbrian became 446th (1st Northumbrian) and 1/2nd became 447th (2nd Northumbrian). In mid-February, the division moved south to take over a section of the line from the French Army. The trenches were in poor condition, and had to be repaired by working parties directed by the field companies.Wyrall, p. 198. In late March, the division moved north again, to take part in the Arras offensive. It consolidated ground captured in the First Battle of the Scarpe (9‚Äì14 April) and then attacked at the Second Battle of the Scarpe (23‚Äì24 April), when it suffered heavy losses. The engineers were engaged in road repair, clearing dugouts, digging and wiring trenches, and laying and repairing telephone lines, all under shellfire, and their casualties were numerous.Wyrall, pp. 205‚Äì25. After a spell in Army Reserve, 50th Division returned to the line, and the summer of 1917 was spent in vigorous trench warfare, with constant patrols, raids, and constructing or repairing defences.Wyrall, pp. 228‚Äì37. It then moved to join the last phase of the Third Ypres Offensive, known as the Second Battle of Passchendaele. Because of the waterlogged nature of the ground, the German defences were based on concrete pillboxes and shell-holes rather than dugouts and trenches. 149th Brigade attacked on 26 October, with 446 Field Company in support. The attack was a failure and the attacking companies were virtually wiped out. Over succeeding days the rest of the division made small gains, at heavy cost. The division was relieved on 9 November.Wyrall, pp. 237‚Äì49. 1918 When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 50th Division was in GHQ Reserve west of the Somme Canal, behind the Fifth Army front that was attacked. During the night the division was ordered up to occupy the rear line of defences known as the 'Green Line', where they came under attack the following day. The division held its positions, but the adjoining division fell back, and the bridges on 149 Brigade's flank had to be held by some of the engineers before they were demolished. The following day, the division was ordered to retreat behind the Somme Canal, and fell back over 10 miles, fighting rearguard actions.Wyrall, pp. 255‚Äì74.Blaxland, pp. 56, 63.Middlebrook, pp. 128, 207.Murland, pp. 156‚Äì60, 163, 171. On 24‚Äì25 March the 50th Division defended the canal crossings, then as Fifth Army continued to retreat, it fell back again during the night of 25/26 March, taking part in the Battle of Rosi√®res over the following two days. On the morning of 27 March the CRE was ordered to form a composite infantry battalion from the 7th and 447th Field Companies and some details of 150th Brigade. The composite battalion took up a position to guard the flank of 149th Brigade but no enemy attack developed on that front. At 11.30, however, divisional HQ received a report that the enemy had broken through at Proyart, and the RE battalion was sent to cooperate with two battalions of the adjacent division (24th Division) in a counter-attack. This counter-attack was held up short of Proyart, but the existing trenches were held during the night and the following day, until the division withdrew towards Moreuil, where the German offensive was finally halted on 31 March.Wyrall, pp. 274‚Äì305.Blaxland, pp. 86, 96, 102.Murland, pp. 190, 193‚Äì4. 50th Division was relieved on 1 April, and was sent north. It took over billets around Estaires on 8 April, just in time to be hit by the second phase of the German Spring Offensive (the Battle of the Lys) the following day, resulting in the Battle of Estaires. The front line held by the 40th Division and Portuguese 2nd Division collapsed, and after they had passed through, 50th Division defended a string of fortified farms and bridgeheads. The troops fought hard all day, and then retired over the rivers Lawe and Lys, destroying the bridges that night. The Germans took Estaires on 10 April, despite counter-attacks, and the division was pressed back through 11‚Äì12 April, fighting rearguard actions. The much-reduced division was relieved at dawn on 13 April.Wyrall, pp. 309‚Äì34.Blaxland, pp. 119‚Äì20. After rest for the division and training for the replacement troops received, 50th Division moved south and relieved French troops in the River Aisne sector. Unfortunately, it was right in the path of the third phase of the German Spring Offensive (the Third Battle of the Aisne),which opened on 27 May. Several battalions were overrun, all the brigade commanders became casualties, and the division effectively ceased to exist by the end of the day. The Divisional Engineers had been sent up with the pioneers and reserves to occupy the Yellow (reserve) line, but were unable to reach it, meeting the advancing enemy before they reached the position. The remnants of the division were withdrawn two nights later.Wyrall, pp. 336‚Äì49.Blaxland, pp. 136‚Äì8.Murland, p. 212. The Northumbrian battalions of the 50th Division were reduced to cadres, training fresh US Army units, while the division was reconstituted with battalions brought back from the Macedonian front. The Divisional Engineers were among the few original parts that remained with the reconstituted division.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 96‚Äì100.Wyrall, pp. 350‚Äì53, 356 & Appendix F.Blaxland, p. 230. The rebuilt 50th Division re-entered the fighting during the Allied Advance to Victory, at the Battle of Beaurevoir (3‚Äì8 October). Considerable opposition was encountered. On 6 October, 150th Bde forced its way into the Beaurevoir Line, but subsequent attacks the following day by 149th Bde failed to progress. 7th Field Company then laid out the jumping-off tapes under cover of darkness and heavy rain, and 151st Bde broke through before dawn on 8 October.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 166‚Äì7, 188. After breaking the Beaurevoir Line, the BEF pursued the Germans to the River Selle, which had to be forced by a set-piece operation (the Battle of the Selle). There was only one sector where 50th Division could cross the river. The CRE, Lt-Col P. de H Hall, and the officers of 7th, 446th and 447th Field Companies reconnoitred the position and drew up plans to use 12 duckboard bridges and four floating bridges for the assault crossing. The bridges were made up with timber from a captured German dump and were concealed about 50 yards from the chosen site. The engineers began work at 01.00 on 17 October, cutting through hedges ahead of the infantry. When the artillery barrage came down at Zero Hour (05.20), the bridging parties (one RE officer and one pioneer officer, 17 sappers and 50 pioneers for each group of four bridges) advanced and assembled their bridges in ten minutes: 'all this, thanks to the thick mist, was done under the noses of the enemy without a casualty'.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 308‚Äì9. The division then crossed the river and embarked on bitter fighting for the 'Railway Triangle' on the outskirts of Le Cateau.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 309‚Äì12, 320‚Äì1. After a period in reserve, the division rejoined the offensive, forcing its way through the Forest of Mormal and across the River Sambre by plank bridges (4‚Äì5 November). The division continued the pursuit until it was relieved on 10 November, and the following day the Armistice with Germany came into force. Demobilisation began in December, and by March 1919 the division and its elements had been reduced to cadre and had gone home.Wyrall, pp. 354‚Äì6.Blaxland, pp. 238‚Äì9, 241, 247, 251, 255.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 473‚Äì5, 494‚Äì5, 501‚Äì2, 508, 521. The following officers served as CRE of 50th (Northumbrian) Division: * Col F.S. Crawford, 23 May 1907 ‚Äì 16 April 1915 * Lt-Col J.E. McPherson (previously OC 2nd Northumbrian Field Company), from 16 April 1915 * Lt-Col C.W. Singer, 16 July 1915 ‚Äì 23 December 1916, 25 March‚Äì4 April 1917 * Maj E.C. Henderson (temporary), 23 December 1916 ‚Äì 25 March 1917 * Lt-Col H.E.F. Rathbone, 9 April 1917 ‚Äì 5 February 1918 * Lt-Col J.A. McQueen (previously acting, 4‚Äì9 April 1917), 5 February‚Äì24 June 1918 * Lt-Col P.de H. Hall, from 30 July 1918 63rd Division 2nd Northumbrian Division, numbered 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division from August 1915, was an exact duplicate of the 50th Division. It began to assemble in and around Newcastle in January 1915 as part of Northern Command. Its divisional RE comprised the 2/1st and 2/2nd Northumbrian Field Companies and the 2/1st Northumbrian Signal Company, all based at Newcastle.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 37. The division was responsible for the Seaham Harbour‚ÄìSunderland‚ÄìNewcastle coastal stretch in the defence of North East England. As early as January 1915, the 2nd Line units of the division began to be called upon to provide drafts to the 1st Line, and were rarely up to strength thereafter. 2/1st Northumbrian Field Company was replaced in 63rd Division by 3/1st, and when divisional RE establishments were increased to three field companies, a new 1/3rd was added by January 1916. The divisional signal company was numbered 63rd. In November 1915, 63rd Division moved to Nottinghamshire, with the divisional RE at Worksop. At this period the division formed part of the Eighth New Army. But the drain of drafts to 50th Division fighting on the Western Front was so great that the division's infantry units were never up to strength. The decision was made in Spring 1916 to break up the division. The 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division ceased to exist on 21 July 1916. Its number (together with the divisional artillery) was transferred to the Royal Naval Division, but the divisional field companies were transferred to the 15th Indian Division, serving in Mesopotamia.Perry, pp. 134‚Äì6. 63rd (2/1st Northumbrian) Divisional Signal Company did not go overseas and was broken up for drafts in England. The following officer served as CRE of 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division: * Lt-Col J.E. McPherson (previously CRE, 50th Division), from 18 November 1915 15th Indian Division The division was formed on 7 May 1916 in Mesopotamia, and had already seen action. The Northumbrian engineers joined the division on the Euphrates front as follows: * 2/2nd Northumbrian Field Company, joined on 1 December 1916, numbered 448th (Northumbrian) Field Company on 6 March 1917 * 3/1st Northumbrian Field Company, joined on 10 March 1917, numbered 450th (Northumbrian) Field Company on 6 March * 1/3rd Northumbrian Field Company, joined on 10 January 1917, numbered 451st (Northumbrian) Field Company on 6 March The division took part in the Capture of Ramadi on 28‚Äì9 September 1917, the occupation of Hit on 9 March 1918, and the Action of Khan Baghdadi on 26‚Äì7 March 1918. At the end of the war the division was rapidly run down, and was formally disbanded in March 1919. The following officers served as CRE of 15th Indian Division while the Northumbrian companies were attached: * Lt-Col C.B.L. Greenstreet, 28 October 1916 ‚Äì 7 February 1917 * Lt-Col J.F. Turner, from 7 February 1917 641st (Northumbrian) Field Company In May 1915 all TF men who had only signed up for Home Service were transferred to Home Defence brigades (termed Provisional Brigades). 2nd Provisional Brigade was formed in North East England from the home service men of 50th (Northumbrian) and 49th (West Riding) Divisions, including 2nd Provisional Field Company, RE. By March 1916 the Provisional Brigades were concentrated along the South East Coast of England. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The provisional brigades and units received numbers and henceforth part of their role was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. 2nd Provisional Brigade became the 222nd Infantry Brigade, and in March 1917 the field company was redesignated 641st (Northumbrian) Field Company. The unit never served overseas but lasted until at least August 1917.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 64.RE Museum list of WWI unit war diaries.David Porter's work on Provisional Brigades at Great War Forum.Miscellaneous units at Regimental Warpath. 454th (Northumbrian) Reserve Field Company was also formed (probably from 2nd or 3rd Line Territorials) and existed from January to December 1917. Little is known about it, but it did not proceed overseas, and was probably absorbed into the central training organisation in 1918. Interwar The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division reformed in April 1920 in what was now termed the Territorial Army, with its engineers organised as follows:Titles and Designations, 1927.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 91. 50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Engineers, RE * 232nd (Northumbrian) Field Company * 233rd (Northumbrian) Field Company * 234th (Northumbrian) Field Company Signals units were transferred from the RE to the newly formed Royal Corps of Signals in 1920: 50th Divisional Signals at Gateshead absorbed 5th (Cyclist) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment and moved to Hull. Later, each division was assigned a 'Field Park Company', which acted as a base for the field companies and held specialist equipment, including the divisional bridging platoon.Ellis, Normandy, Appendix IV. 50th Division's Field Park Company was numbered 235 in sequence after the field companies. After the Munich Crisis in 1938 the TA was doubled in size, with most existing units and formations creating duplicates. 232‚Äì235 Companies of 50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Engineers were duplicated by 505‚Äì508 Companies, but instead of the new units being assigned to the new 2nd Line division (23rd (Northumbrian) Division), they were mixed, as follows:Northern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files 50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Engineers, RE * 232nd (Northumbrian) Field Company * 505th Field Company * 235th (Northumbrian) Field Park Company 23rd (Northumbrian) Divisional Engineers, REWatson & Rinaldi, p. 93. * 233rd (Northumbrian) Field Company * 507th Field Company * 508th Field Park Company Northern Command * 234th (Northumbrian) Field Company at Gateshead * 506th Field Company at Newcastle World War II Battle of France Formation sign of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division in World War II. =50th Division= The 50th Division joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in February 1940.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 141.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 19.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 25. When the Germans attacked in May, the division moved up into Belgium with the rest of the BEF and took up positions on the River Dendre.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 49. However, the Germans broke through French lines and the BEF was forced to retreat. By 19 May, 50th Division was moved back to Vimy Ridge north of Arras to prepare for a counter-attack as part of 'Frankforce.'Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 73.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 83. On 21 May part of the division attacked, supported by tanks, in what became known as the Battle of Arras.Ellis, France & Flanders, pp. 89‚Äì91. However, after this brief check, the Germans continued to advance, and Arras became a dangerous salient and a further attack was cancelled.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 149. By now the BEF was cut off from the bulk of the French armies, and began its retreat towards Dunkirk. 50th Division was sent north to Ypres, where it found an open flank where the Belgians had already retreated.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 196. It began a planned withdrawal,Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 201. providing a rearguard for the eastern flank of the BEF, suffering heavy casualties from bombardment as it did so.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 215. By the night of 31 May‚Äì1 June the division was back across the French frontier, in reserve to the French defenders.Ellis, France & Flanders, pp. 231‚Äì5.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 239. The division, less its heavy equipment, was evacuated from Dunkirk on 1 June and landed in the United Kingdom the following day.Joslen, pp. 81‚Äì2. =23rd Division= 23rd (Northumbrian) Division only became operational on 2 October 1939, and almost immediately, 506 Field Company was withdrawn to join the reforming 5th Infantry Division and then 2nd Infantry Division, which it served throughout the war. Partly trained, 23rd Division was sent to France in an incomplete state primarily to provide labour behind the lines, but after the German breakthrough it was ordered up to defend a frontage of 16 miles along the Canal du Nord. Outflanked, and faced with five German Panzer divisions, the infantry and engineers fell back towards Arras, doing what they could to hold up the enemy and suffering heavy casualties in the process. The division played a peripheral part in the Battle of Arras and by 27 May had retreated into the Dunkirk perimeter, by which time it was incapable of further action.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 138‚Äì9.Joslen, p. 62.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 14.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 21.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 65.Ellis, 'France & Flanders, pp. 76‚Äì81.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 89.Ellis, 'France & Flanders, p. 188.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 225. After evacuation from Dunkirk, 23rd Division was broken up. 233 Field Company rejoined 50th Division, while 507 Field Company and 508 Field Park Company transferred to London Defence Troops RE. 507 Field Company later went to Northern Ireland with 148 Brigade Group until mid-1942 when it joined 47th (London) Infantry Division, a reserve formation, with which it remained until the end of the war. Joslen, pp. 41 & 333.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 163.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 168. 508 Field Park Company was assigned to VIII Corps Troops, Royal Engineers by February 1941 and apart from a brief interval it served with that unit in home defence and throughout the campaign in North West Europe.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 132. North Africa After re-equipping and retraining in the United Kingdom, 50th Division sailed on 23 April 1941 for Egypt.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 319. Following spells in Cyprus, Iraq and Syria, it joined British Eighth Army for the Battle of Gazala (26 May‚Äì21 June 1942).Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 319. 150th Brigade, with 232 Field Company under command, had formed an independent brigade group and had been in the Western Desert since the previous November. It rejoined the division in February 1942, but during the 'Battle of the Cauldron' at Gazala the whole brigade, including 232 Field Company, was captured on 1 June and never reformed. 235 Field Park Company also disappeared from the division's order of battle on the same day, being temporarily replaced by 142 Field Park Squadron from 1st Armoured Brigade, but returned in September. For the battles of Mersa Matruh and Alamein and for the remainder of the North African Campaign, the division operated with just its two surviving field companies (233 and 505) and field park (295). After Mersah Matruh they were engaged in developing a reserve position behind the main defence line at El Alamein. During the pursuit to Tripoli after the battle they were kept busy repairing roads demolished by the retreating enemy.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 365, 394, 406. They also suffered casualties while clearing mines.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 227, 231. 50th Division moved up from Tripoli to lead the attack at the Battle of Mareth on 20 March 1943. The enemy position was behind the Wadi Zigzaou, wide, with almost unclimbable sides high. The divisional engineers under their CRE, Lt- Col C.E.A. Browning, made quantities of fascines and scaling ladders, with which they and the infantry advanced 'as though at the storm of Badajoz', according to the RE's historian. The infantry stormed three or four strongpoints and formed a bridgehead. Under accurately ranged shellfire and enfiladed by machine guns, the sappers began to build fascine causeways for tanks and vehicles. Casualties were extremely heavy, but they managed to complete one causeway for tracked vehicles. They were unable to improve it for wheeled vehicles, and the first light tanks to cross it caused such damage in the mud that the heavier tanks could not follow. On the night of 21/22 March heavy rain produced a spate in the Wadi that further damaged the crossing. The 'shattered and weary' 50th Divisional RE were reinforced by Sappers and Miners from 4th Indian Division, and started work in the evening of 22 March on two new causeways, while the enemy were counter-attacking: the wadi was under heavy close-range fire and the rising moon silhouetted the men working on the far bank. The causeways were completed at 03.30 on 23 March under a heavy barrage preceding another enemy counter-attack. The sappers then withdrew without hurrying, so as not to alarm the defending infantry.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 412‚Äì3.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 334‚Äì5, 338‚Äì41. 50th Division was also in the forefront of the attack on Wadi Akarit on 6 April, when the divisional engineers had the task of clearing gaps in the minefields and making crossings over the anti-tank ditch.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 415‚Äì6.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 364‚Äì7, 372. Sicily In April 1943, in preparation for the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), 50 Division was joined by 168 (London) Infantry Brigade (consisting of 1st London Scottish, 1st London Irish Rifles and 10th Royal Berkshire Regiment) from 56th (London) Infantry Division, which brought 501 Field Company with it, which was soon replaced with 295th Fd Co, another London unit.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 167.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p 5. The 50th Infantry Division was in the first assault wave and then fought its way up the east side of the island, including the Battle of Primosole Bridge.Barnes, pp. 3‚Äì55.Molony, Vol V, pp. 102‚Äì5. After the fighting was over in Sicily, 168 (London) Brigade was replaced by 231 Independent Infantry Brigade (2nd Devonshire Regiment, 1st Dorset Regiment and 1st Hampshire Regiment), together with 295 Field Company, a Territorial Army unit originally recruited in London. These had fought through the Sicilian campaign and the assault landing in Italy in September. They now became permanent parts of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. The divisional bridging platoon became an independent unit (as 15 Bridging Platoon) within the Divisional RE in August.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 185. With its experience of amphibious assaults, 50th Division was earmarked for the forthcoming invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) and sailed for Britain in October 1943.Barnes, pp. 53‚Äì5. North-West Europe On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 50th Division carried out the landings on Gold Beach. For this it was heavily reinforced, including two squadrons (81 and 82) of 6th Assault Regiment RE from 79th Armoured Division equipped with AVREs, and two additional field companies RE (73 and 280) carrying explosives to deal with beach obstacles. These troops were the first to reach the beach and begin work under fire before the assault infantry arrived. The division's own 235 Field Park Company formed specialist detachments, driving bulldozers etc.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 334, 348‚Äì50, 356.Joslen, p. 581.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 171‚Äì8.Barnes, pp. 74‚Äì9 & Appendix C. Once off the beach, 50th Division pushed inland towards Bayeux, and then consolidated its gains over the next few days against German counter-attacks. Progress towards Villers-Bocage was held up by strong Panzer units.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 209‚Äì13, 230‚Äì1, 253-6.Barnes, pp. 102‚Äì15. For the next two months the division fought its way slowly through the Bocage country before being relieved on 5 August.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 334, 388‚Äì9, 402, 409.Barnes, pp. 116‚Äì31. However, it was back in action on 9 August, attacking against stiff opposition in the advance beyond Mont Pincon as the Allies closed the Falaise Gap.Barnes, pp. 132‚Äì7. Once the Seine was crossed and the pursuit began, 50th Division supported 11th Armoured Division's rapid advance, protecting the flank and 'mopping up' local resistance. On 1 September the division secured bridges over the River Somme near Amiens and reached Arras. On 3 September it took part in the Liberation of Brussels.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 468‚Äì71.Barnes, pp. 137‚Äì40.Ellis, Germany, pp. 4‚Äì6. More resistance was met at the Albert Canal, and 50th Division had to make an assault crossing in storm boats, after which the engineers erected (and maintained under heavy fire) a folding bridge, while the infantry pushed on and captured Gheel after bitter fighting. (7‚Äì11 September).Barnes, pp. 141‚Äì7.Ellis, Germany, pp. 12‚Äì3. The division was due to play a minor role in Operation Market Garden, holding the bridgehead from which Guards Armoured Division advanced, and later defending the road and bridge at Nijmegen, but the latter turned into a major defensive battle after the defeat at Arnhem. Again, damage to the bridges had to be made good by the engineers.Barnes, pp. 148‚Äì55.Ellis, Germany, pp. 32, 42, 98. The defence of the Nijmegen bridgehead was 50th Division's last operation. It was by now very weak, and in December 1944 it was broken up to provide replacements for other units in 21st Army Group. Most of the division's units returned to the United Kingdom as training cadres to turn surplus Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel into infantry. However, the Divisional RE continued its frontline engineering role, the four companies becoming 50th GHQ Troops RE within 21st Army Group until the end of the war in Europe.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 122.Barnes, pp. 156‚Äì9.Ellis, Germany, pp. 158‚Äì9, 371. 50th GHQ Troops RE For the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) 50th GHQTRE's field companies constructed a vital access road, dubbed 'Caledonian Road', along the river bank to allow amphibious Buffalos and trucks carrying rafting equipment to cross a flooded area to reach the bank. The stores for the first of this road were brought forward, dumped, and camouflaged during the night of 22/23 March. At dusk the following evening, as the assault crossing began, the field companies started work and although hampered by enemy fire (the RE and Pioneers assisting them suffered over 50 casualties) they completed their 800 yards before dawn, when fire from Rees across the river halted further work. After the town was subdued the road was completed to its full length. At first it was made from channel tracks, which were later covered with soil so that carriers could run over them. But rain on 26 March turned this into slippery mud and the soil had to be scraped off again and replaced with coir matting and Sommerfeld tracking.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 489‚Äì90.Saunders, p. 65. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 50th Divisional RE was reformed as 103 Field Engineer Regiment, RE, with 232, 235 and 506 Companies and 235 Park Company now designated as squadrons. When the division was reorganised as a division/district command in 1961, 103 Regiment was broken up and 505 Fd Sqn disbanded, but 232 and 506 Fd Sqns and 235 Fd Park Sqn continued to be assigned to the divisional HQ.Divisional RE at British Army 1945 on.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 291, 301, 305. A major reorganisation in 1967 saw the division/district disbanded, and its RE component reformed as HQ Squadron and 103 (1st Newcastle) Field Squadron of 72 Engineer Regiment. The remainder of 72 Engineer Regiment was formed by the lineal descendants of the Tyne Electrical Engineers, thus uniting the lineages of all the Newcastle and Durham Engineer Volunteers of 1860 and 1874).Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 314, 318. 72 Engineer Regiment was reduced to a single squadron in 1999 but reformed in 2006 as 72 (Tyne Electrical Engineers) Engineer Regiment (V), as a Close Support RE regiment, with the following organisation:Royal Engineers TA at ARRSEpedia72 Engineer Rgt at The Sappers Site * 103 (1st Newcastle) Field Squadron at Newcastle and Sunderland * 106 Field Squadron at Sheffield and Bradford * 299 Parachute Squadron at Wakefield and Hull 72 Engineer Regiment supported 21 and 23 (Air Assault) Engineer Regiments of the Regular RE. Under the Future of the British Army (Army 2020) plans, 72 Engineer Regiment was withdrawn from the Army's order of battle by December 2016, but 103 Field Squadron, based in Tyneside, continued after being resubordinated to 21 Engineer Regiment as part of a hybrid Regular and Reserve Unit.Army Reserve changes and future basing In November 2017, 103 Field Squadron was resubordinated from 21 Engineer Regiment in Ripon to 71 Engineer Regiment, based out of RAF Leuchars. 103 Field Squadron continues to operate as a detached Squadron from the Army Reserve Centre in Debdon Gardens, Newcastle. Memorials A World War I memorial to the men of the Durham Fortress Engineers and its three field companies was unveiled in Jarrow Drill Hall in 1928. An additional inscription to 233rd Field Company (of the Northumbrian Divisional Engineers) was added after World War II. The memorial is now in the RE Army Reserve Centre at Debdon Gardens, Newcastle. North East War Memorials Project Ref J2.33 Notes References * B.S.

He was a pupil of Francesco Bartolozzi and one of the band of stipple-engravers who worked under that artist. He produced some excellent specimens of engraving in this branch of art, and later, by combining a certain amount of work in line with that in stipple, produced a variety of effect. He engraved some plates after John Boydell, Robert Smirke, and Thomas Stothard, for Boydell's 'Shakespeare Gallery,' and a great number of plates after Angelica Kauffmann, William Hamilton, William Redmore Bigg, Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, and others. He was also largely employed in engraving portraits, including those for Thane's 'Illustrious British Characters.' He engraved a portrait of Thane, in the line manner, after W. R. Bigg. His wife Mary Ogborne, appears on two plates after William Hamilton, and may have assisted him in other works. A number of his prints were published by himself at 68 Great Portland Street, London. Ogborne also made topographical views using aquatint engraving techniques. He appears to have died in 1837.

He is often grouped with Bruno Taut, Ernst May and Walter Gropius as being among the most significant representatives of the Modernist (\\"Neues Bauen\\") architecture that became important initially during the Weimar period, notably in respect of residential accommodation. Life Early years Otto Haesler was born in Munich slightly fewer than ten years after Bavaria had been incorporated into the new German state. He attended secondary school in Passau where during school holidays he worked as a draftsman for the city building department. Between 1898 and 1902, he attended Building Academies in Augsburg und W√ºrzburg. For the school in Bannetze Haesler invoked a relatively traditional repertoire, specifying an interrupted-hipped roof (Kr√ºppelwalmdach). In 1902, Otto Haesler began training as a bricklayer in Frankfurt am Main. In 1903, he took a job in the Frankfurt office of the noted architect Ludwig Bernoully. Later on in 1906, he set himself up in his own architecture practice in Celle, focusing on commercial renovation and \\"new- build\\" developments. A significant project from this time was the \\"Tr√ºllerhaus\\". In 1908, he joined an architectural partnership with Karl Dreher. In 1914, he applied unsuccessfully for a position in public office locally as B√ºrgervorsteher. Between 1915 and 1917, when he was wounded, he participated in the war. The end of the war in 1918 marked the start of a busy period for Haesler, now aged nearly 40. In 1918, he produced his proposal for the \\"Auf der Heese\\" residential development in Celle's Carstens Street (Carstensstra√üe). This referenced back to existing plans from before the war, as a watercolour drawing by his former partner Karl Dreher, who had been killed in 1916, demonstrates. Each of the 32 terraced houses featured a saddleback roof and a kitchen/living area, adumbrating mainstream features of \\"modern\\" twentieth century housing. For detached buildings, such as the school (originally drawn by Haesler in 1911, and today used as a day centre and meeting space), in the village of Bannetze, he had invoked a more traditional repertoire, specifying an interrupted-hipped roof (Kr√ºppelwalmdach). Neues Bauen Otto Haesler's \\"Italian Garden Settlement\\" (1924/25) was the first of his three residential developments in Celle. Haesler championed the building of social housing, providing improved living conditions for an increased number of tenants at an affordable rent. He wanted to reduce costs and at the same time improve living spaces by using standardised floor plans and employing the newly available steel frame construction methods. He therefore oriented and designed his developments to maximise the use of sunlight, replacing corridors with living rooms able to benefit directly from the afternoon sun, and bedrooms directly accessible from the day-time living spaces. He rationalised and industrialised modern residential development. There are three residential Otto Haesler developments in Celle dating from the mid 1920s and early 1930s. =Italian Garden Settlement= With his first, the \\"Italian Garden Settlement\\" (\\"Siedlung Italienischer Garten\\") of 1924/25 Haesler incorporated inspiration he had gained from a visit to Bruno Taut in Magdeburg. Haesler publicised the modern design-language of the new buildings across Germany: shortly after completion, the Italian Garden Settlement came to be seen as the first \\"Neues Bauen\\" residential development in the country. There was no attempt at \\"interesting\\" ground plan lay-outs, and Haesler did not entirely stay within the economic restrictions mandated. =Georgsgarten Settlement= Haesler's \\"Georgsgarten Settlement\\" (\\"Siedlung Georgsgarten\\"), in 1926/27, was the first industrially constructed \\"ribbon cell\\" (terraced format) residential development. With the \\"Georgsgarten Settlement\\" Haesler succeeded in creating an \\"urban planning first\\". He applied the \\"Cabin floor plan\\" concept developed by Ludwig Hilberseimer, which gave rise to an open- plan cell structure, but combined that with contemporary fashionable touches such as prominent balconies, apparently influenced by the Gropius Bauhaus development in Dessau. The Georgsgarten also marked the first outing for the protruding three-sided glazed stair housing which from now on became a Haesler trademark. Bluml√§ger Field Settlement (1930/31) The \\"Friedrich Ebert Ring road settlement\\" in Rathenow again featured Haesler's \\"trademark\\" three-sided glazed stair housinings. =Bluml√§ger Field Settlement= It was only with the florally named \\"Bluml√§ger Field Settlement\\" (\\"Siedlung Bluml√§ger Feld\\") of 1930/31 that it became possible to apply the planned rents. An unusual feature of this development was that each residential unit was assigned its own tenants' garden, directly accessible at the ground floor level. The incorporation of gardens gives the development a \\"garden city\\" character. The settlement was partly torn down in 2003, but the second phase, on the north side of the \\"Galgenberg\\" Street, remains fully preserved from that redevelopment. =Other works= Although it is convenient to group together Haesler's three major \\"Neues Bauen\\" residential development projects in Celle, by the late 1920s he was also undertaking high-profile projects in other cities. So far not mentioned works include: *The \\"Friedrich Ebert Ring road settlement\\" in Rathenow (1928‚Äì31) *The \\"Altst√§dter secondary school\\" in Celle (1928) *Buildings in the \\"Dammerstock settlement\\" in Karlsruhe (1929) *The \\"Rothenburg settlement\\" in Kassel (1929‚Äì31) *The \\"Marie von Boschan Aschrott retirement home\\" in Kassel (1930‚Äì32) Memberships Otto Haesler was a member of the \\"Bright Star Masonic Lodge\\" (\\"...zum hellleuchtenden Stern\\") from 1909 till 1931. In 1925 he was invited to join the increasingly influential German Craftsmen's Association, and in 1926 he joined Der Ring, an advocacy group created by modernist architects which would be dissolved when confronted by violent government opposition in 1933. In 1927 he accepted an invitation to join the National Research Association for Economy in Building and Housing (RfG).Reichsforschungsgesellschaft f√ºr Wirtschaftlichkeit im Bau- und Wohnungswesen (RfG) In 1930 he was appointed as Expert Advisor to the RfG board. He also found himself proposed as a successor to Ernst May as city architect and planner for Frankfurt am Main, and as a successor to Otto Bartning as head of the Building Academy at Weimar. In 1932 Haesler resigned from the Association of German Architects and founded the operation \\"heimtyp ag\\". Economic and political crisis The early 1930s saw a return to economic collapse and eye watering levels of unemployment in Germany. The political left was split and the political centre was fragmented, which opened the way for the rise of the populist right wing NSDAP (Nazi party) under the able leadership of Adolf Hitler. Nazi ideology incorporated a remarkable capacity for hatred, and one of the Nazi targets was Bauhaus architecture, which Hitler passionately condemned as degenerate art. Following the General election of November 1932, in which the Nazis, with 37% of the vote, emerged as the largest single party, they took power in January 1933, and the ensuing months saw a rapid retreat from democracy, in favour of one-party government. Otto Haesler was subject to physical attacks: he also suffered an intense reputational assault from conservative and Nazi architects and by the Nazi press. \\"Heimtyp ag\\" which Haesler had founded in 1932 was bankrupted in 1933. Twelve Nazi years Violently attacked by the regime, in 1934 Haesler went into a form of internal exile, closing down his office in Celle and relocating to Eutin, a small town in Schleswig-Holstein, some 130 km (80 miles) from the Danish border. Here he continued to build houses, now using the traditional brick construction characteristic of the region, but still with structural elements of modern architecture. In 1939 Germany invaded Poland, triggering a more general war across much of Europe. By this time Haesler had evidently returned to favour sufficiently to be appointed Deputy City Building Consultant for Lodz, controlled by Germany and increasingly populated by ethnic Germans between 1939 and 1945, and for Lemberg (under German control between 1941 and 1944). In 1943 Haesler was also part of a planning project for the reconstruction of Sebastopol which had recently been largely destroyed in fighting. Soviet occupation zone War ended in May 1945 and with it, as some thought, one-party dictatorship. The eastern part of Germany was now subsumed into Poland and the Soviet Union, while the rest of the country was divided into four military occupation zones. Haesler was given responsibility for rebuilding the destroyed city of Rathenow, an hour or so to the west of Berlin. This involved relocating, in 1946, to what was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, where he would continue to live after the entire zone was transformed, formally in October 1949, into a Soviet sponsored stand-alone German state, the German Democratic Republic. Haesler would retain responsibility for the Rathenow rebuilding plans till 1955, latterly in partnership with Karl V√∂lcker. In 1950 he was appointed Professor for Residential Development, and between 1950 and 1952 he served as head of the Building and Arts section of the Weimar Building Academy (as it was known by this time). However, at the end of 1951, with one-party government restored, the Ulbricht government came up with a strategy for architecture. This involved a rigorously applied change of direction in favour of \\"National building\\", which meant a stigmatising of the Bauhaus movement and its economically focused functionalism. Otto Haesler, now aged 71, found his own architectural philosophy and career abruptly sidelined. In 1953 Haesler relocated from Rathenow to the Potsdam quarter of Wilhelmshorst, and in 1958 he married Erna Heer who had for many years worked as his housekeeper. She was his second wife. He died four years later in 1962, following medical complications after he fell into a trench that was part of a project to build a house he had designed for himself and Erna.

Indutai's father Dinkarrao Nikam was in the freedom movement beginning in 1930 and became a Communist when he was in jail for satyagraha and met Communist leaders like Bhai V.D. Chitale. Indutai started reading books such as Volga te Ganga when she was 10‚Äì12 years old, took part in morning processions of Congress in the village, supported the families of freedom movement leaders staying at her home in Indoli, tal. Karad. She started going to Rashtra Seva Dal. Personal life In 1942, Indutai left her parental home at the age of 16 and joined the 1942 Independence movement against the British rule, organizing women and spreading the Rashtra Seva Dal. She gradually started taking part in the underground movement of the prati sarkar by 1943, carrying arms (pistols and revolvers) to the fighters. She married Krantivir Babuji Patankar on 1 January 1946, with whom she had fallen in love during her work with the 'Prati Sarkar'. Both were leading activists in the 'Prati Sarkar' or the parallel government movement that was part of the India's independence movement in the Satara District in the 1940s. The core of the prati sarkar lay in the one hundred or so underground activists ‚Äì those who left their homes, moved from village to village serving as full timers, carrying guns or other weapons, ready to confront the police if necessary and carrying out ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù as well as military and administrative tasks. They were organized into groups which were effective decision-making centers for most activity. Representatives of all groups met from time to time at the district level. At the village level, these activists moved to establish various structures that included volunteer squads and to some extent panch committees chosen or elected by the villagers themselves. This village structure developed only with the movement itself in late 1944 and 1945. Babuji and Indumati Patankar established the Kasegaon Education Society and the first high school in Kasegaon called Azad Vidyalaya. She supported Babuji in establishing the Kasegaon Education Society and became one of its first women students, and later became a primary school teacher. She supported the family by working as a teacher and going to the fields every morning and evening along with her mother-and father-in-law. She continued working as a teacher until her retirement, while continuing throughout to take part in the movement. Activism Both Indutai and Babuji became part of the Socialist Party along with many others all over the country. Because of theoretical and political differences around 1949 they became part of the Socialist Party (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) under the leadership of Aruna Asaf Ali. Then in 1952 they became Communists. Babuji was killed by anti-social elements in connivance with the then-controllers of the state. Indutai as a young widow single-handedly continued to raise her family, particularly their baby boy Bharat who had been born on 5 September 1949. She also continued to participate in Communist party activities. Just as her earlier maternal home Indoli had been a center of Communist activities, now Kasegaon became a center in old Satara district. She was continuously working in women's organizations, toiling peoples' movements including agricultural laborers' movement, and social work. She is the core leader Stree Mukti Sangharsh Chalwal with several other rural women fighting against violence and for survival and livelihoods. Through this work she led the struggle of parityakta (abandoned/deserted) women. This movement of parityakta women for ration cards, alimony, and recognition of their rights has gone on since 1988 in Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts. This was one of her special contributions. After her son Bharat Patankar became a full-time activist in the movement, she has been supporting him morally and economically, along with his wife Gail Omvedt, and has taken leading role and part in every activity of Shramik Mutki Dal.

He cleared the 2008 UPSC Civil Services Examination with an all-India rank of 34. Opting for Indian Administrative Service, he was trained at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, for a probation period of two years between August 2009 to August 2011 and was allotted his home state cadre of Karnataka.  Career  As Assistant commissioner in Gulbarga Ravi's first posting as a civil servant was as the Assistant commissioner in Gulbarga from August 2011 to December 2012, following which he served as the Deputy commissioner of Kolar district, Karnataka from August 2013 to October 2014. During this tenure, he was known for his work in ridding encroachments and exposing sand mafia in the district. As Deputy commissioner of Kolar district During his stint as a Deputy commissioner of the Kolar district from August, 2013 to October, 2014, Ravi became almost a public figure due to his functioning as a pro people administrator, and launching of innovative reforms like conducting of Revenue and Podi adalats, which went on to being getting recognized and implemented in other districts by the state government. He also had taken many bold steps to protect encroachment on government lands, including tanks, the main water source in the region and had ensured the checks on quality of building materials of public property like roads, during his tenure at Kolar. Subsequently, he was transferred out of this position in October, 2014, allegedly due to pressure from vested interests involved in land grabbing and illegal sand mining. His popularity among people of Kolar was evidenced when large number of people staged protests, following his transfer orders as deputy commissioner. As Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Enforcement) Ravi was posted as the Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Enforcement) by the government on 29 October 2014 in Bangalore. Following this, he prepared a list of top-50 tax defaulters and set a target of tax collection from the tax evading defaulters. He began raids in Bangalore and expanded to places across Karnataka raiding well-known business groups such as Embassy which include shares of state home minister, Rajesh Exports, Shubh Jewellers, RMZ Institution, Nitesh Builders, Prestige Group, Raheja Developers and Mantri Developers, and had reportedly collected over in the first two weeks. Following this, he allegedly received threat calls from the defaulters. Death On 16 March 2015, Ravi was found hanging at his residence in Koramangala, Bangalore. He had gone to office from Nagarbhavi, Bangalore (the house of his in-laws), on Monday morning. He returned to his apartment at St John's Woods near Koramangala by 11.30 a.m. (IST). His family found him hanging by the ceiling fan in his bedroom of their apartment at 6:30 p.m. (IST), when they rushed home after he would not return phone calls made during the day. Following the news reaching the Bangalore police, Police commissioner M. N. Reddi said that forensic and medical evidence hinted the death was prima facie a case of suicide. An autopsy on his body was conducted on the morning of 17 March at Victoria Hospital in Bangalore, following which it was shifted to his in-laws' house in Nagarbhavi. His last rites were performed on 18 March in Bangalore. The eleventh day ritual, in accordance to customs of Hinduism was held in his hometown Doddakoppalu, with his nephew performing the rituals.  Aftermath  Ravi's death infuriated people and the civil society alike who took to the streets on March 17 across parts of Karnataka such as Kolar and Gulbarga, where he served as an Assistant Commissioner. Towns in Kolar district observed total bandh with shops, commercial establishments, schools and colleges staying closed during the day, with state-run and private buses, auto rickshaws and other vehicles not operating. The protest was joined by lawyers, students and workers of various political parties and organizations. Crowds in Bangalore gathered in protest demanding an independent probe into the case and outside his residence to pay tributes to him. This was also followed by outpouring of anger and grief by people in various social media platforms like Facebook, Quora and Twitter. On March 17, opposition parties in Karnataka Legislative Assembly demanded from the government an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), but were refused. They went on to protest the government by launching in assembly, the overnight sit in. The government, however, announced a Crime Investigation Department (CID) investigation the same day. But some critics and members of the public opposed to the investigation by the CID, a police agency under the control of state government, which might risk the investigation's impartiality, efficiency and thoroughness. During initial investigations, the police made references to 44 phone calls made by Ravi to a female Indian Administrative Services batchmate, within an hour, on 16 March, the day he died. However, subsequent CBI Investigation denied this, while revealing that he had called her only once, not 44 times. The Karnataka High Court restrained the government from publishing any interim report of the CID. Yielding to pressure from protests carried out by people across Karnataka and parts of India, and by the opposition parties in the assembly, the state government agreed to hand over the case to the CBI on 23 March 2015. In April 2015, the union government ordered a CBI probe after the Karnataka government sent a fresh notification without any time limit for the probe. In its report submitted to the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru South Sub-Division and Sub- Divisional Magistrate in November 2016, the CBI concluded that Ravi committed \\"suicide due to personal reasons\\". On 26 November, it was communicated to the government by the Magistrate to close the case under section 176 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In popular culture Chambal (film) was loosely based on the life of DK Ravi.  See also  * Land grabbing * Sand Mining in India References External links * Biodata of D. K.

At one time the complex housed a Catholic parish in the Diocese of Davenport. St. Joseph and St. Mary of the Assumption parishes merged in the 1990s to form Saints Mary and Joseph Parish. In 2007 when that parish merged with Sacred Heart on the west side to form Holy Family Parish, St. Joseph's Church was closed. The former church, chapel, rectory, convent, and school were included as contributing properties in the Park-to-Park Residential Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History St. Joseph‚Äôs Church The original St. Joseph's Church (1840) St. Joseph's 1847 church The Catholic Church in Fort Madison was organized by a missionary priest to the Midwest named John George Alleman. Initially, he stayed in the home of John Gerhard Schwartz, where he also celebrated the first Mass in the town. Schwartz also offered his assistance in building the first Catholic church in the community. St. Joseph parish was organized in 1840 in what was then the Diocese of Dubuque. Besides John Schwartz, the first parishioners included his brother Henry Schwartz, Herman Dingman, Joseph Hellman, Henry Tieken, Bernard Tieken, Richard Fahey, Liborious Nelle, Henry Becker, and their families. Within six years their numbers had swelled to 75 families, and the small brick church the first families built became too small, so a new church was built in 1847. Father Alleman lived in a room in the basement of the church and, at the request of Bishop Mathias Loras, ministered to the German people of Southeastern Iowa, as well as the Illinois community of Nauvoo, Illinois. Father Alleman also established the first parochial school at St. Joseph's and was its first teacher. The School Sisters of Notre Dame from St. Louis were the first sisters to teach in Fort Madison. They were replaced at St. Joseph by the Congregation of the Humility of Mary. The school grew to include elementary and secondary grades. The last church building for the parish, which still stands on the east side of downtown, was built in 1886. St. Mary's and Sacred Heart In 1857 St. Joseph's pastor, the Rev. Alexander Hattenberger planned for a larger and more centrally located church for his growing parish. However, the American Civil War shelved whatever plans were made. During the pastorate of the Rev. John B. Weikman property was purchased west of the downtown area in April 1865. In August of the same year ground was broken for a new school and then a new church. On September 3, 1865, a riot erupted among the parishioners prompted by those who were opposed to the move. The controversy lasted for eight years and resulted in numerous building delays. The new school building was dedicated on November 9, 1865, as Kreutz Erhohung Schule (Exultation of the Cross School). It was named for the day (September 14) that the School Sisters of Notre Dame came to Fort Madison from Milwaukee in 1860. The Rev. Jacob Orth became pastor the following year and construction on the new church preceded with the laying of the cornerstone for the present St. Mary's Church on July 18, 1866. Plans were made to move to the new parish facilities in late 1870, but Bishop John Hennessy of Dubuque refused to dedicate the new church until its debt of $7,000 was paid off. Father Orth decided to act on his own and dedicated the new church himself on January 1, 1871. He was replaced as pastor the following month by the Rev. Aloysius Meis. The parish fluctuated between being known as St. Joseph's, the German Catholic Church in recognition of the parish's many German parishioners, as well as other names. The confusion ended in January 1874 when St. Joseph's was given its own pastor at its original location. The new facility became a new parish and was placed under the patronage of St. Mary of the Assumption. The third parish in Fort Madison was founded in the town's Santa Fe neighborhood near the Santa Fe Railroad yards on the west side of town. The Rev. Louis DeCailly from St. Joseph's opened a school in Ivo Dentz's tin shop at the corner of Santa Fe and Union Avenues (present-day Avenue L and 23rd Street) on September 8, 1892. The Sisters of Humility from St. Joseph were placed in charge. DeCailly would occasionally celebrate Mass for the people of the area. Sacred Heart Parish was established the following year with the Rev. Peter Hoffman as pastor. Mergers The first merger of the Catholic Community in Fort Madison happened in the parochial schools. Both St. Joseph's and St. Mary's high schools merged in 1925 to form Catholic Central High School in the St. Mary's building. Aquinas High School replaced it on the city's northwest side in 1959. The three parishes continued to operate their own grade schools until 1966 when St. Joseph's, St. Mary's, and Sacred Heart were consolidated to form St. Joseph's Middle School for 7th and 8th grade students, using the St. Joseph's building. St. Joseph's K-6 students were then sent to St. Mary's. Sacred Heart and St. Mary's continued to operate their own grade schools until 1977 when they were consolidated to form Aquinas East, which was at St. Joseph's, and Aquinas West at Sacred Heart. By the 1990s the Catholic Schools in Fort Madison and the Marquette Catholic Schools based in nearby West Point were both struggling. The two Catholic school systems merged and a new school named Holy Trinity opened in July 2005. Demographics in the city of Fort Madison and the Diocese of Davenport began to change in the latter half of the 20th century. Fort Madison lost population and the religious habits of Catholics started to change. The diocese also experienced a decline in the number of priests. A plan to consolidate parishes in the diocese was developed under Bishop Gerald O‚ÄôKeefe. St. Joseph's and St. Mary's merged in 1996 and used both parish names in the name of the new parish, Saints Mary and Joseph. In 2007 Saints Mary and Joseph merged with Sacred Heart and formed Holy Family Parish. Bishop Martin Amos celebrated the last Mass in St. Joseph's Church on November 17, 2007. The former church building is now a wedding chapel. Architecture St. Joseph's Church was built in the Gothic Revival style in 1886. The central bell tower, capped with a spire, is original to the church. The entry vestibules and corner towers that flank it were added in 1906. The church was constructed of brick on a stone foundation. The lancet windows are filled with stained glass, as is the small rose window above the main entrance. There is another small rose window in the center of the church's apse. Paired lancet windows line the side walls of the church. The interior is divided into three naves by columns of the Corinthian order. A hipped roof with a gable front-end caps the structure. To the west of the church is a small brick chapel. It is a reconstruction of the 1840 church on its original foundation. The structure was built around 1914. It features a front gable and the roof is composed of asphalt shingles. The former rectory is located to the east of the church and faces Fifth Street. It is the only structure not built by the parish. The house was initially built for Dr. James H. Bacon, a physician, and his wife Sarah Coffman Bacon in the 1850s. The Bacon's owned the house until 1883 when it was bought by George and Natalie Schafer. He was a druggist and president of the George H. Schafer & Co. He also served as vice president and president of the American Pharmaceutical Association. St. Joseph's bought the house for its rectory around 1925 and it was used for that purpose until 1996. It is once again a private home. The two-story house was constructed of brick on a stone foundation in the Greek Revival style. The roof is a dual-pitched hipped roof with asphalt shingles. The house was remodeled in the 1950s at which time the two-car garage was built near the alley. The garage is a brick structure with a hipped roof, and it is also a contributing property in the historic district. The former convent was built by the parish for its rectory in 1880. It served that purpose until around 1925 when it was converted into a convent for the Sisters of Humility who taught in the parish school. The house served as the convent until 1979. It is now a private residence. The two-story house is located to the west of the chapel on Avenue F. It was constructed of brick on a stone foundation in the Italianate style. A two-car garage was built around 2000 and it is connected to the house by a breezeway. The house features a hipped roof and the garage features a front gabled roof. The former school building sits across Avenue F from the church. Designed by Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling, it is a two-story brick structure built on a raised basement. The foundation is composed of concrete. It has a flat roof. The Neoclassical style building was completed in 1926 and used as a school until 2006.

He had a period as a Bevin Boy down Bold Colliery before serving as a Marconi wireless operator in the Merchant Navy during World War II. After the war, having literary aspirations but not knowing how to pursue them, he became a bus driver with Liverpool City Transport;Obituary for Peter Graham Scott ‚Äì The Daily Telegraph 11 August 2007 here he worked with Harold Hargreaves Harrison, the father of George Harrison. His first marriage in 1945 to Evelyn M Howarth was later dissolved. While still driving buses in Liverpool he met local school teacher Joan Thomas; she encouraged him to start writing by renting a typewriter for him when he could not afford to do so for himself. She hired him the cheapest available, a pink model as these were not suitable for offices because of their bright colour. The couple married in Liverpool in 1964. Initially his short stories and articles were published in Australian magazines before he made the break into writing for television. Television writing Abraham's writing for television included Coronation Street (1960), The Verdict is Yours (1962), Suspense (1963), The Villains (1964), No Hiding Place (1960‚Äì1964), Catch Hand (1964), Londoners (1965), King of the River (1966), Z-Cars (1967), The Expert (1968), The First Lady (1969), Dixon of Dock Green (1969), Counterstrike (1969), Paul Temple (1969‚Äì1970), Owen, M.D. (1971‚Äì1972), and The Onedin Line (1971‚Äì1980). Abraham on the Internet Movie Database The Onedin Line Abraham had originally envisaged The Onedin Line as being about a modern shipping company with its boardroom battles and seagoing adventures, but then he discovered that almost all such companies were run by boards of anonymous executives. However, he noticed that most of these companies had their origins in the 19th century, mostly started by one shrewd and far-sighted individual who, through his own business acumen, built up a shipping line from nothing.McLeay, Alison. The World of the Onedin Line David & Charles (1977) pg 9 Abraham stated that James Onedin was not based on one individual but was rather an amalgamation of several characters. Suggested real-life inspirations include Victorian era shipping line owner James Baines & Co. of Liverpool (a leading character in the series was named 'Captain Baines'), Sir Samuel Cunard and the Allan Line. The Onedin Line first appeared as a one-off BBC Drama Playhouse production transmitted on 7 December 1970; and though thought lost, a copy of this episode was found in the American Library of Congress in September 2010. Like the series which was to follow, it was set in Abraham's native Liverpool. Initially Abraham struggled to come up with a title for the drama. An article in Woman magazine published in July 1973 featured an interview with Abraham in which he recalled how he came up with the very unusual family name Onedin. He wanted something unique, he said, and had already decided to call the leading male character James but still had not found a surname. Then came some inspiration ‚Äì he said: The drama so impressed the powers that be at the BBC that a 15-part series was commissioned, with the first episode of Series 1 being transmitted on 15 October 1971; Abraham wrote six episodes in this first series. In total he went on to write 22 of the 91 episodes, which were shown over 8 series. He continued to be involved in the series until his death in 1979. Novels Abraham wrote five of the six novels based on the series, namely The Shipmaster (1972), The Iron Ships (1974), The High Seas (1975), The Trade Winds (1977) and The White Ships (1979). The books are not straightforward novelisations of the television episodes, since the author introduced additional material and also changed a number of details, though dialogue from the series that Abraham had penned himself is used. A series of Onedin short stories by Abraham, set between Series Two and Series Three, appeared in Woman magazine in 1973. Abraham had intended to write a whole series of novels about the Onedin Line, but he died in 1979 after completing the fifth book, The White Ships. The saga was eventually to have seen James and Elizabeth Onedin as two elderly autocrats, both determined not to relinquish their hold on the shipping business. Elizabeth Onedin would have still been a formidable woman in her 90s, while James Onedin would have died aged 102, leaving the family divided over control of the company.McLeay, pg 13 Abraham had intended the Onedin story to continue right up to the 1970s, following the progress of the descendants of Charlotte Onedin and William Frazer, played by Laura Hartong and Marc Harrison in the TV series. Abraham, a heavy drinker, died of liver failure in 1979 aged 64 in Manley in Cheshire where he and Joan lived.Dawe, Christine Merseyside's Own The History Press (2012) Google Books After Joan's death in 2014 Cyril Abraham's archive of scripts, letters and other documents became available for sale on eBay and other sites.Correspondence between The Danglemoon Group and researcher Glenn Christodoulou (Jack1956) References Category:1915 births Category:1979 deaths Category:English television writers Category:English historical novelists Category:Novelists from Liverpool Category:20th-century English novelists Category:English male novelists Category:20th-century British male writers Category:British male television writers Category:20th-century British screenwriters ","title":"Cyril Abraham"},{"id":"45689579","text":"Nagelkaas, also called Frisian Clove cheese,Nagelkaas (igourmet.com) is an unprotected name variant of kanterkaas, a Dutch cheese developed in the Frisian Islands of the Netherlands.

The industries which most often manufactures free-form surfaces are basically aerospace, automotive, die mold industries, bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing. Generally 3 or 5 axis CNC milling machine is used for this purpose. The manufacturing process of free form surface is not an easy job as the tool path generation in present CAM technology is generally based on geometric computation so tool path are not optimum. The geometry can also be not described explicitly so errors and discontinuities occurrence in the solid structure cannot be avoided. Free-form surfaces are machined with the help of different tool path generation method like adaptive iso-planar tool path generation, constant scallop tool path generation, adaptive iso-parametric method, iso-curvature, isophote and by other methods. The different methods are chosen based on the parameters which is needed to be optimized. Different tool path generation methods # Iso- planar tool path method: This is the most common and robust method used to machine free-form surface. In this process tool path generation is done by intersection of surfaces with parallel plane in Cartesian space. # Adaptive iso-planar tool path method: In this process the surface are partitioned into different regions according to their slope with the intersection planes by applying the concept of isophote. # Iso-scallop method: Scallop generated between two adjacent machining path is constant. Optimization of free-form surface machining CAM software generally creates a tool path without considering any mechanics process. These causes risk of tool damage, tool deflection and errors on surface finish. By minimizing the forces we can increase tool life. Different optimization method can be used considering process parameters like feed rate, spindle speed, steps, tool diameter, magnitude and preset maximum force. The optimization can be done for minimum machining time, minimum tool travel, minimum production cost or for good surface finish. Efficiency of surface machined is also considered by maximum scallop height and by gouging. Gouging are the main reason for discrepancies of surface accuracy and texture specification. It also causes damage to part,s surface and machine tool. Scallop height tolerance help us in measuring the quality of free-form surface. Selection of proper topology result in minimum path length. In CAM software choosing NURBS to create surface is considered to be good method for presenting surface as it is accepted by both IGES and STEP files of CAM software.

Early life Ganz was born in Hewlett, New York, the daughter of Norma and Harry Ganz. Upon receiving a degree in Biology from New York University in 1977, Ganz spent two years modeling and serving as an apprentice in the family‚Äôs private-label blouse company. During that time, Ganz learned her parents‚Äô business; her mother taught her the design aspects while her father shared knowledge on the fundamentals of manufacturing and business. Career In 1986 Ganz found financial backing and launched NBG Fashions to market her own clothing line, Nancy Ganz sportswear, which at one point was valued at $1.5 million. Amidst the re-emergence of miniskirts in the 1980s, Ganz discovered that women had few options in terms of supportive undergarments. In 1988 she invented a nylon-and-Lycra straight slip that compressed women‚Äôs hips and stomach. Ganz named it the Hipslip and began offering the modernized girdle free to retailers who purchased her sportswear collection. Understanding the need to prevent competitors from imitating her product, Ganz trademarked Hipslip. Upon the product‚Äôs success, Ganz shut down her apparel business, conducted market research for eight months, and used her own savings to found Bodyslimmers in 1990. In the company‚Äôs first month, Bodyslimmers sold 40,000 Hipslips. Ganz credits her invention to realization of a practical need. In 1991, The Wall Street Journal reported that in a six-month period Bloomingdale's had seen girdle sales as a category increase 35% and attributed the increase in part to the sales of Ganz‚Äôs Hipslip. Ganz and Bodyslimmers developed into a multi-line operation, creating and marketing body-slimming products, including the Belly Buster and Butt Booster. In 1996, Warnaco Group of New York purchased Bodyslimmers for a reported $15 million. The purchase allowed Warnaco to capitalize on Bodyslimmers‚Äô popularity and enter the baby-boomers market, and Ganz went on to run the operation for Warnaco as president of the new Nancy Ganz/Bodyslimmers division. In the same year, she launched a line of body- slimming products aimed at men. In 1997 Ganz unveiled a new retail shopping concept called the Body Bar, a self-servicing lingerie shopping assistant which provided product information based on anatomical area, and reduced shoppers' dependency on salespeople. Personal life Ganz is married to Savills Studley CEO Mitchell S. Steir and has two children. In 2006 she created Fashionfantasygame.com, a social networking web game that has been used in some universities as part of business education programs that allow students to make real world business decisions in the fashion retail or fashion-design industries. Impact In 1999, Ganz was interviewed in the A&E; television documentary \\"Unmentionables: A Brief History\\", which featured commentary from lingerie experts regarding the evolution of undergarments. Ganz or her products have been featured on several television programs, including Oprah, Regis and Kathy Lee, CBS News, and QVC. Ganz‚Äôs products have been described as a sign of independence and autonomy for women by some feminists.

Issues Government integrity Since 2011 SCPC has contended that the main obstacle to free market reforms in South Carolina isn't a lack of public support but an unaccountable legislative elite whose goal is to preserve power. In February 2013, SCPC filed a complaint against Bobby Harrell, South Carolina's Republican Speaker of the House. The complaint alleged that Harrell had committed a variety of abuses of office, including using public office for personal gain. In October 2014, Harrell pleaded guilty to misconduct in office and resigned his position. Roll-call voting SCPC is known for having originated the idea of mandatory roll-call voting in the South Carolina General Assembly (an idea then Rep. Nikki Haley used as the centerpiece of her campaign for governor) and for its detailed explanations of policies and legislation on government restructuring, school choice, government spending, taxes, regulation, and health care. Legislative power SCPC has repeatedly criticized that South Carolina's government puts the lion's share of power in the hands of a few legislative leaders, meaning most of the state's citizens cannot vote for the people who hold power over them. \\"From education to road funding, from the judicial system to your electric bill, the important decisions are made by state lawmakers who represent only their districts.

Income disclosure Citing South Carolina's loose disclosure laws that allow elected officials to receive private income from entities that benefit from those officials' influence and votes, the Policy Council began advocating mandatory income disclosure in 2008. In 2013 the group launched Project Conflict Watch, which offered lawmakers and constitutional officers the opportunity to voluntarily disclose their income sources. In 2016 the legislature passed a bill, signed into law by Gov. Nikki Haley, that mandated disclosure for some payments, but the group criticized the law on the grounds that it contains several loopholes that will allow officials to get around the law.

Versatility & Adaptability In addition to the original English version, the IRI has proven equally effective when translated into other languages and for diverse populations. A study by De Corte et al. (2007) demonstrated this versatility by translating the IRI into Dutch.De Cort√©, K., Buysse, A., Verhofstadt, L. L., Roeyers, H., Ponnet, K., & Davis, M. H. (2007). Measuring empathic tendencies: Reliability and validity of the Dutch version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Psychologica Belgica, 47(4), 235-260. The researchers found that their translation is just as valid and reliable as Davis's original version, albeit in their educated, still Westernized sample. Another study by P√©loquin and Lafontaine (2010) adapted the IRI to specifically measure empathy in couples rather than individuals.P√©loquin, K., & Lafontaine, M. (2010). Measuring empathy in couples: Validity and reliability of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index for couples. Journal of Personality Assessment, 92(2), 146-157. This was achieved by rewording some phrases used in the original, for example replacing references to \\"people\\" and \\"somebody\\" to be \\"my partner,\\" etc. Several couples were also asked to return after twelve months to be re-evaluated. This new version still adequately measured empathy as well as demonstrated predictive validity in the returning couples, correlating relationship satisfaction and each partner's empathy. However, limitations to its versatility have been found in more disparate populations. Garcia-Barrera, Karr, Trujillo-Orrego, Trujillo-Orrego, and Pineda (2017) translated and modified the IRI into a Colombian Spanish version.Garcia-Barrera, M. A., Karr, J. E., Trujillo-Orrego, N., Trujillo- Orrego, S., & Pineda, D. A. (2017). Evaluating empathy in Colombian ex- combatants: Examination of the internal structure of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) in Spanish. Psychological Assessment, 29(1), 116-122. This version was used to measure empathy in Colombian militants returning to society after having seen combat. The study encountered more difficulty in obtaining valid and reliable findings than previous studies. They attributed this difficulty largely due to the lack of education of the participants, which resulted in the introspective and abstract items of the IRI being difficult to understand.

After the Byzantine army was annihilated by the Bulgarians in the battle of Achelous, the Byzantine diplomacy incited the Principality of Serbia to attack Bulgaria from the west. The Bulgarians dealt with that threat and replaced the Serbian prince with a prot√©g√© of their own. In the following years the two empires competed for control over Serbia. In 924 the Serbs rose again, ambushed and defeated a small Bulgarian army. That turn of events provoked a major retaliatory campaign that ended with the annexation of Serbia in the end of the same year.  Prelude  Soon after Simeon I (r. 893‚Äì927) ascended to the throne, he successfully defended Bulgaria's commercial interests, acquired territory between the Black Sea and the Strandzha mountains, and imposed an annual tribute on the Byzantine Empire as a result of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian war of 894‚Äì896. The outcome of the war confirmed the Bulgarian domination on the Balkans but also exposed the country's vulnerability to foreign intervention under the influence of the Byzantine diplomacy. As soon as the peace with Byzantium had been signed, Simeon I sought to secure the Bulgarian positions in the western Balkans. After the death of prince Mutimir (r. 850‚Äì891), several members of the ruling dynasty fought for the throne of the Principality of Serbia. In 892 Petar Gojnikoviƒá established himself as a prince. In 897 Simeon I agreed to recognize Petar and put him under his protection, resulting in a twenty-year period of peace and stability to the west. However, Petar was not content with his subordinate position and sought ways to achieve independence. Battle of Achelous, Madrid Skylitzes. After almost two decades of peace between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine emperor Alexander (r. 912‚Äì913) provoked a conflict with Bulgaria in 913. Simeon I, who was seeking pretext to confront the Byzantines to claim an imperial title for himself, took the opportunity to wage war. Unlike his predecessors, Simeon I's ultimate ambition was to assume the throne of Constantinople as a Roman emperor, creating a joint Bulgarian‚ÄìRoman state. Later that year he forced the Byzantines to recognize him as Emperor of the Bulgarians (in Bulgarian, Tsar) and to betroth his daughter to the under-age emperor Constantine VII, which would have paved his way to become father-in- law and guardian of the emperor. However, after a coup d'√©tat in February 914 the new Byzantine government under Constantine VII's mother Zoe Karbonopsina revoked the concessions and the hostilities continued. On 20 August 917 the Byzantines suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Bulgarian army in the Battle of Achelous which de facto brought the Balkans under Bulgarian control. Weeks later, another Byzantine host was heavily defeated in the battle of Katasyrtai just outside Constantinople in a night combat.  Wars  A seal of Simeon I. Shortly before the Battle of Achelous the Byzantines had tried to create a wide anti-Bulgarian coalition. As part of their efforts the strategos of Dyrrachium Leo Rhabdouchos was instructed to negotiate with the Serbian prince Petar Gojnikoviƒá, who was a Bulgarian vassal. Petar Gojnikoviƒá responded positively but the court in Preslav was warned about the negotiations by prince Michael of Zahumlje, a loyal ally of Bulgaria, and Simeon I was able to prevent an immediate Serb attack. Following the victories in 917 the way to Constantinople lay open but Simeon I decided to deal with prince Petar Gojnikoviƒá before advancing further against the Byzantines. An army was dispatched under the command of Theodore Sigritsa and Marmais. The two persuaded Petar Gojnikoviƒá to meet them, seized him and sent his to capital Preslav, where he died in prison. The Bulgarians replaced Petar with Pavle Branoviƒá, a grandson of prince Mutimir, who had long lived in Preslav. Thus, Serbia was turned into a puppet state until 921. A map of Bulgaria during the rule of Simeon I. In an attempt to bring Serbia under their control, in 920 the Byzantines sent Zaharija Pribislavljeviƒá, another of Mutimir's grandsons, to challenge the rule of Pavle. Zaharija was either captured by the Bulgarians en route or by Pavle, who had him duly delivered to Simeon I. In either way, Zaharija ended up in Preslav. Despite the setback, the Byzantines persisted and eventually bribed Pavle to switch sides after lashing much gold on him. In response, in 921 Simeon I sent a Bulgarian army headed by Zaharija. The Bulgarian intervention was successful, Pavle was easily deposed and once again a Bulgarian candidate was placed on the Serbian throne. The Bulgarian control did not last long, because Zaharija was raised in Constantinople where he was heavily influenced by the Byzantines. Soon Zaharija openly declared his loyalty to the Byzantine Empire and commenced hostilities against Bulgaria. In 923 or in 924 Simeon I sent a small army led by Thedore Sigritsa and Marmais but they were ambushed and killed. Zaharija sent their heads and armour to Constantinople. This action provoked a major retaliatory campaign in 924. A large Bulgarian force was dispatched, accompanied by a new candidate, ƒåaslav, who was born in Preslav to a Bulgarian mother. The Bulgarians ravaged the countryside and forced Zaharija to flee to the Kingdom of Croatia. This time, however, the Bulgarians had decided to change the approach towards the Serbs. They summoned all Serbian ≈æupans to pay homage to ƒåaslav, had them arrested and taken to Preslav. Serbia was annexed as a Bulgarian province, expanding the country's border to Croatia, which at the time had reached its apogee and proved to be a dangerous neighbour. The annexation was a necessary move since the Serbs had proved to be unreliable allies and Simeon I had grown wary of the inevitable pattern of war, bribery and defection. According to Constantine VII's book De Administrando Imperio Simeon I resettled the whole population to the interior of Bulgaria and those who avoided captivity fled to Croatia, leaving the country deserted.  Aftermath  The Byzantines sending envoys to the Serbs and the Croats, Madrid Skylitzes. The Bulgarian advance in the Western Balkans were checked by the Croats who defeated a Bulgarian army in 926. Similarly to the case of Serbia, Croatia was invaded in the context of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian conflict, because king Tomislav (r. 910‚Äì928) was a Byzantine ally and harboured enemies of Bulgaria. After the death of Simeon I on 27 May 927 his son and successor Peter I (r. 927‚Äì969) concluded a favourable peace treaty with the Byzantines, securing recognition of the Imperial title of the Bulgarian rulers, an independent Bulgarian Patriarchate and an annual tribute. Despite this diplomatic success and the end of the 14-year-long conflict, the beginning of Peter I's reign was plagued by internal instability. The young monarch faced two consecutive revolts by his brothers Ivan and Michael. The Serbian prince ƒåaslav took advantage Peter I's internal problems.

History Old bridge Depiction of the old bridge and Kelso Abbey The first bridge at the site was opened in 1754, funded by public subscription. It had six arches, and replaced a ferry which was dangerous during times of bad weather and limited the volume of traffic that could pass through the town. An arch collapsed in 1756, killing 6 people. The bridge was repaired, but a storm on 25 October 1797 caused damage to the foundations of the centre arches, and the weakened structure collapsed into the river the following day. Replacement John Rennie engineered the replacement bridge, which was built between 1800 and 1803, but he had been considering the design since 1798. It was his first major road bridge, and he gave exacting instructions for its construction, advising the trustees to build deep foundations by day labour instead of contract. The piers were sunk into the bedrock to a depth of using cofferdams, this level being around below low water. The cofferdams were kept dry by a pump driven by a water wheel on the south bank of the river. The bridge was built by a partnership between John Murray of Edinburgh and Robert Lees of East Lothian. It is situated about downstream of the site of the old bridge. The replacement bridge cost , part of which was funded by a government loan. This money was repaid by collecting tolls, which were meant to be collected only until the cost of construction had been repaid, but in 1825 the right to collect tolls was let at per year, making the bridge extremely profitable. The collection of tolls continued until 1854, when there were riots protesting the failure of the trust that ran the bridge to publish accounts. Soldiers were called from Edinburgh to restore order, but no ringleaders were caught and the collection of tolls was abandoned later that year. The bridge was repointed in 1921. In 1956, it was proposed that the bridge be widened, but the Fine Art Commission protested on the grounds that it would upset the architecture of the bridge. By the 1980s the parapets were both leaning outwards, and work was undertaken in 1981 on the upstream side and 1985 on the downstream side to rectify this by demolishing each parapet and rebuilding it plumb. In 1993, a fire engine crashed through the parapet whilst en route to an incident, resulting in the death of the driver. At the north-east end of the bridge is a tollhouse built for the bridge, which is also a category A listed building along with the bridge. Design The Kelso Bridge has five elliptical arches of span and rise, and is wide between the parapets. A pair of engaged Doric columns rises from the semicircular cutwaters on each of the piers. The high approach at the south end meant that to keep the deck level, as was Rennie's style, an embankment had to be built at the north end. The design of the Kelso Bridge inspired Rennie's design of the Waterloo Bridge in London. The bridge carries the A699 public road between the north and south of the town. Downstream from the Kelso Bridge is Hunter's Bridge, a concrete viaduct opened in 1998 to direct traffic away from the centre of Kelso.

The company uses advanced algorithms and data sets to predict outcomes of social and commercial problems. It works primarily in the fields of security, retail, education, insurance and healthcare. History PredictifyMe was founded in 2012 by Rob Burns, Garrett Perdue and Marcy Bucci. Rob met Dr. Usmani during Eisenhower Fellows. Usmani had completed his Ph.D. at Florida Institute of Technology where his thesis involved a predictive model of suicide bombings that is used for forensic investigations and prevention tool. Burns received his M.B.A. from George Washington University and spent 15 years studying how kids' lives are impacted based on the location where they are born. Burns and Usmani worked together for two years, adapting Usmani's predictive model to predict social and commercial impacts for various regions of the world. PredictifyMe started with seed round funding of approximately $250,000. The company tried to raise $1 million, but stopped asking for funding due to the number of clients it signed up minimized the need for extra capital. The final amount of funding totaled $305,263 according to its Form D filing. PredictifyMe was officially launched in 2014. Products and services PredictifyMe's initial products included Hourglass and its various versions for different verticals. The company ventured into the healthcare market in 2015, developing its Hourglass software. The software predicts potential medical outcomes such as the anticipated number of pregnancies in a particular area. It also assists in optimizing healthcare spending, predicting healthcare demands based on preemptive healthcare. Hourglass Retail is part of the software that measures impact of marketing dollars in the retail industry. Partnership with the United Nations On March 18, 2015, UN special envoy for global education and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Partnership of United Nations with PredictifyMe. The sole purpose of Partnership was to involve the technical abilities of PredictifyMe to counter terrorist attacks on educational institutes all over the world. Mr. Brown pledged to fight terrorism and related causes that hinders the basic right of education to children.

He was a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Science and the Brundtland Commission. He was one of the pioneers of the Russian environmental movement and one of the early global sustainability advocates. Sokolov was Professor and Head of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology at the Faculty of Biology at Moscow State University; Director of the Institute of Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology at the Russian Academy of Sciences; and Deputy Chairman of Chemical, Technological and Biological Sciences at the USSR Academy of Sciences. He is the biological grandfather of Evgeny Lebedev, owner of The Evening Standard and Independent newspapers (with and after his father, Alexander Lebedev, exc- KGB officer). Life Sokolov was born in Moscow, the son of a zoology professor. He graduated from Moscow State University in 1950, with aspirations to become a mammalogist. He then became a Senior Lecturer and Head of Postgraduate Studies at the Moscow Institute of Fisheries (1953‚Äì1956); Professor and Head of the Department of Soil and Biology Faculty at Moscow State University (1956‚Äì1967) and later Director of the Institute of Evolutionary Morphology and Ecology of Animals. He was Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1967‚Äì1998) and also the International Academy of Science, Munich. In 1990 Sokolov became a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His research focused on ecological morphology, electron microscopy and histology, the hydrodynamics of swimming and environmental physiology, bionics and telemetry, radio-ecology and ecotoxicology and ground-based environmental monitoring. He showed great interest in environmental law and wildlife management issues, conservation of biodiversity and rare species, the history of zoology and environmental education. During his work Sokolov organised numerous zoological expeditions in the Soviet Union, as well as abroad to Bolivia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Mexico, Mongolia, Peru and Vietnam. His research interests were diverse. He studied radiobiology in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as ethology and the systematics of mammals. A species of rodent, Cricetulus sokolovi, was named after him. Also, a species of legless lizard, Ophisaurus sokolovi, was named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

They were constructed during the 5th century B.C. and continued to develop throughout their use. In the 2nd century A.D. they were used as the foundation for the construction of the Kladeos Baths. They are called Greek Baths in order to distinguish them from the baths of the Roman period at the same area. The initial simple building with the well was gradually transformed into a luxurious space with more complex architecture and ample decorations and mosaics. In the Roman period, the water supply and drainage systems were perfected. There were both hot and cold baths, as was common in training areas and sport competition venues. The Greek baths were built to service the needs of the athletes, since they used them to wash after training or after the Ancient Olympic Games. In those days, athletes would rub their body with oil and then throw dust on it during training, in order to improve their performance. This was a time-consuming process, but it was necessary and followed a certain ritual. The cleaning of their body after training sessions and sport competitions was very important for the athletes. First, they used the strigil to scrape the oils and dust off their bodies. Then, they were massaged to soothe the nervous system. The last part was the ‚Äòcleansing‚Äô of the body and soul with water.

A member of the communist party, in 1917 she was the only woman to participate on behalf of the Liga Central de Resistencia at the first meeting of the Yucat√°n Socialist Party in M√©rida. In 1919, she founded the Mexican Feminist Council campaigning for better social and economic conditions for women as well as the right to vote. She devoted considerable efforts to improving education in Mexico, especially by facilitating the training of primary school teachers in rural areas. Biography Elena Torres Cu√©llar was born 3 (or 23) June 1893 in Mineral de Mellado, Guanajuato, to Macedonio Torres and Francisca Cu√©llar. She graduated from the public schools and attended night classes at the Guanajuato State Normal School, working at the mine hospital during the day. Studying accounting, typing and drawing, Torres graduated in 1912 and became principal of the Normal School. She also taught at the Silao Elementary School and the Casa del Obrero Mundial (The House of the World Worker), an anarchist-union organization which had branches throughout Mexico. Socialist schooling methods, based on \\"scientific\\" principals had been brought to Mexico at this time from Spain. Torres and the teachers she worked with became increasingly radicalized and favored the rational Spanish method over the Catholic parochial schools. From 1909, she wrote articles opposing the Porfiriato regime, using the pen names of Una Guanajuatense and Violeta. In 1916, she attended the first National Feminist Congress in M√©rida. She collaborated with the governor of Yucat√°n Salvador Alvarado who provided support for the second feminist congress in November 1916 at which a wide range of topics were discussed, including employment, education, suffrage, birth control and divorce. Impressed with Torres' performance, Alvarado encouraged her to found a Montessori school in M√©rida, the state capital. It was the first such school in Mexico. In 1918, she associated with Trotsky's Third International, joining Felipe Carrillo Puerto in establishing Yucat√°n's Socialist Party in which she campaigned for women's rights. In 1919-20, together with Mar√≠a del Refugio Garc√≠a, she founded the Mexican Feminist Council (Consejo Feminista Mexicano) in Mexico City which supported social rights for women and their right to vote. In 1921, at the Second Workers' Congress in Izamal, Torres insisted women should be allowed to attend congresses and express their views. Torres represented the Mexican Feminist Council at the 1922 League of Women Voters convention in Baltimore, where she also attended the Pan-American Conference of Women with a delegation of Mexican women. She was elected the association's vice-president for North America. In 1923, she went on to establish the Mexican chapter of the Pan-American Association for the Advancement of Women in Mexico City as well as Mexico's Women's Congress where she played a leading role in settling differences between conservative delegates and feminist radicals from Yucat√°n. From 1921, Torres played an increasingly important role on the education front under the education minister Jos√© Vasconcelos. In state run schools, a free breakfast program was organized in that year, with Torres directing the services and even serving many of the meals. In the first year, they fed nearly 3,000 students daily and the following year the number had increased to 12,000 students per day. She fought for improved teacher training and became head of the Bureau of Cultural Missions which targeted improved conditions for primary school teachers, especially those working in rural areas. By 1926, six missions had been established covering over 2,000 rural teachers, expanding to 18 missions and more than 4,000 teachers over the next ten years. In 1924, Torres was granted an international scholarship to study abroad and she completed her studies at Columbia University Teachers' College in New York City. While there she attended the 1925 Pan-American Women's Conference in Washington, DC and returned to Mexico in 1926. Originally, she was assigned back to the rural teaching mission project but on 17 May 1926 she was appointed chief professor of the Faculty of Letters at the Higher Normal School. She lost her post in 1927 due to her criticism of Mexican president Plutarco El√≠as Calles, moving back to the United States and taking a Spanish teaching job at the International School of Missouri. She returned briefly to Mexico in 1928 to campaign for Jos√© Vasconcelos's failed re-election bid, but when Pascual Ortiz Rubio won the presidency, she returned to the US. Torres received an appointment from the Ministry of Public Education on 1 February 1932 and returned to the rural normal school program. In 1933, in an innovative program she gave home economics classes over the radio. The plan was to broadcast the educational programs throughout the country to all the farm village schools. In 1934, Torres was appointed to the Cuerpo T√©cnico de Educaci√≥n Rural (Corps of Rural Education Technicians) to create a standard curriculum for teaching Home Economics. That same year, she traveled to a regional conference in Chile and in the fall made subsequent trips to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru to talk about rural education in Mexico and visit their educational facilities. A similar trip was made in 1936 to Venezuela. She was appointed as the Professional Director of the Urban and Rural Primary Education Affairs Bureau in 1937. Her most important achievement at the bureau was a survey conducted in 1937 of the economic and social circumstances of the local residents of all 338 villages of Mexico. In 1942, Torres was appointed to the Elementary Education Inspectorate and worked as an inspector until 1955. During this time frame, she also served as an adviser to UNESCO. Torres died on 19 October 1970. Autobiography In 1964, Elena Torres published her autobiographical work Fragmentos.

The Mexican government has attempted to monitor and absorb these groups into the federal government to act as Rural Police in order to avoid clashes between the paramilitaries and the Mexican Armed Forces itself.Heineman, Matthew.

A&E; Indie Films Michoac√°n state  Background  The presidential administration of Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa (2006‚Äì2012) began a fight against drug cartels in the state of Michoac√°n. The primary resource used in the fight was the anti-drug joint police and military initiative known as Operation Michoac√°n. However, even though in states such as Tamaulipas or Veracruz killings by criminal and military power declined significantly, the campaign against organized crime has caused violent response, increasing the vulnerability of the civilian population due to skirmishes between these organizations and the federal forces.Parish Flannery, Nathaniel. \\"Calder√≥n‚Äôs War.\\" Journal of international affairs, 17 Apr. 2013, jia.sipa.columbia.edu/calderons-war.  History  When the criminal groups known as Los Zetas took over the streets of Michoac√°n from the previously dominant criminal groups in this state, a local criminal gang La Familia Michoacana was created to oust them and to take back control of the area. In recent times the first notable self-defense event occurred on April 15, 2011 when a group of indigenous people in Cher√°n armed with rocks and fireworks attacked a bus carrying illegal loggers armed with rifles and associated with the Mexican drug cartel La Familia Michoacana. The indigenous people assumed control over the town, expelled the police force and blocked roads leading to oak timber on a nearby mountain. The vigilante activity spread to the nearby community of Opopeo. They established self-defence groups. Mexico has recognized Cher√°n as an autonomous indigenous community, but criminals continued to murder residents in the forest. When power vacuum occurred La Familia Michoacana fell into infighting and disintegrated, its former members created the Knights Templar Cartel. At first this new criminal group had the support of civil society, believing their promises of protection from Los Zetas, but soon began to commit the same atrocities committed by La Familia Michoacana and Los Zetas: they began to extort, kidnap, murder and rape civilians, leading to a situation of semi slavery. For this reason, on February 24, 2013 Hip√≥lito Mora, Estanislao Beltr√°n and some land-owners, like a doctor from the community of Tepalcatepec Jos√© Manuel Mireles Valverde and Alberto Guti√©rrez, took up arms against the Templar Cartel and all criminal groups that wanted to impose dominance in the area, entering a new phase in the war against drug trafficking. As civilian open-carry of weapons is restricted in Mexico and military grade weapons are illegal, federal forces could not legally distinguish between armed-civilian convoys and drug-cartel convoys, they started a hard process of regularization of these militias. Some defense groups and their members were absorbed into a faction that answers to the Mexican Army (SEDENA) and also registered their weapons; some were issued new legal-weapons by the government. Other members did not join, arguing fear of disarmament and distrust in the government that left them alone for so long. The groups are currently divided into registered (Rurales) and non- registered groups (Autodefensas), some of the last are being persecuted by the authorities for failing to register their heavy weapons. This had led to armed clashes between factions, both factions state that they are being betrayed by their former colleagues, or that some member of the opposite faction has ties with the cartels, in an attempt to legitimize their actions. Leadership The principal founder of the community self-defense forces in Michoac√°n and Guerrero was Jos√© Manuel Mireles Valverde who was a doctor from Michoac√°n. Doctor Mireles was charismatic and well equipped to lead the Autodefensas groups because of his political experience with the Institutional Revolutionary Party.Nuestra Tele Noticias 24 Horas. ‚ÄúAs√≠ surgieron los grupos de autodefensa conocidos como 'polic√≠a comunitaria' en M√©xico‚Äù. YouTube video, 3:51. Posted 13 Jan. 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ifvI6fFgkQ Dr Mireles was critically injured in a plane crash in 2014 which made him unable to continue his previous role as leader of the Autodefensas. After a few months, Mireles returned to the Autodefensas. At this time the Mexican government ordered the Autodefensas to disarm. Many other leaders of the Autodefensas groups complied and Mireles tried to flee the country but was arrested by the Mexican government in late June 2014. Another important leader of the community self-defense forces in Michoac√°n and Guerrero was Estanislao Beltr√°n-Torres who was nicknamed \\"Papa Smurf\\", who took the main leadership in the time Mireles was injured. While Beltr√°n-Torres was charismatic, he did not have the same aptitude for leadership that Dr. Mireles had and he began to lose control of the Autodefensas. When the government ordered the Autodefensas to disarm and join the Rurales, Beltr√°n-Torres decided to obey. A third important leader of the community self-defense forces in Michoac√°n and Guerrero was Nicol√°s Sierra Santana or \\"El Gordo\\". Santana was originally a member of a subset of the Knights Templar Cartel but quickly joined the Autodefensas when he saw the Knights Templar begin to lose power. When the Mexican government ordered the Autodefensas to disarm and Mireles was arrested, Nicol√°s Sierra Santana, joined by many former Autodefensas, created a drug cartel called \\"Los Viagras\\" (which is now known to have ties and rivalry with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel ).Kryt, Jeremy. \\"Meet the Warlord of the Viagras, Mexico's Hardest Cartel Yet\\". The Daily Beast, 3, Dec. 2017. https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-the-warlord-of-the-viagras-mexicos- hardest-cartel-yet Corruption As Autodefensas groups grew, it was hard to maintain a centralized group of leaders. Because of the lack of oversight of Autodefensas groups, these organizations began to be joined by former cartel members and people who felt above the law. One problem that Autodefensas groups faced was a lack of resources, specifically guns. Originally the weapons that Autodefensas managed to recover from skirmishes with cartels were sufficient to arm the vigilantes, as these groups got bigger this did not suffice. In order to arm themselves, many Autodefensas groups began to sell drugs in order to buy weapons. When some Autodefensas groups began to sell drugs, a new cartel emerged from the Autodefensas. Today, this new cartel is called \\"Los Viagras\\" (known to have ties with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel)and is led by one of the former leaders of the Autodefensas, Nicol√°s Sierra Santana, who is also known as \\"El Gordo\\". Los Viagras has been criticized by the government as well as other cartels for their brutal killings and general violence. The infamy of Los Viagras cartel has made their leader, Nicol√°s Sierra Santana, one of the most wanted men in Mexico.  Equipment   Communications  Autodefensas have been known to communicate by telephone with radios and shortwave radios. The \\"gabacha\\" is a radio transmitter and receiver they use to communicate among themselves and, as they also pick up signals from enemy groups, to spy on the posters that also use this device. The most popular name for the device is \\"el escaner\\".  Armament  At first the original groups started with their legal small arms, and hunting club rifles, muskets, and .22 caliber rifles (weapons statutorily permitted by the Ministry of Defense ), but as the groups started to defeat criminals, they also were gradually seizing military weapons (M4, AK47, MP5, G3, M60) as well as buying equipment from the black market sponsored by the wealth of the region and other drug cartels fighting their common enemy cartel. They have even been seen with Barret .50 caliber sniper rifles. The Autodefensas were recognized as a fairly organized armed force with military small arms capability, while not being under federal government command, thus unconstitutional according to Mexican law. For this reason the SEDENA ordered the disarmament of the Autodefensas, many autodefensas complied. They were ordered to register their weapons (those within the legal parameters of not being military grade weapons) to the Ministry of Defense and keep those weapons for their individual home protection (as mandated by the Mexican law). Those who joined the rural guards were allowed to open carry (as any police force does), keep their weapons and were issued a standard M4 rifle. Currently there are many complaints that special treatment is given to certain groups. These people argue that the Mexican bureaucracy only allows some groups to register and only offers government protection to some groups.  Vehicles  Autodefensas have different types of vehicles of different brands, mostly pickup trucks and SUVs confiscated from the Cartels. They also have homemade armored vehicles.  Clashes with the Federal Forces  * In late 2012 and early 2013, Self-Defense Groups in Michoac√°n took control of several towns to displace criminal groups such as the Caballeros Templarios, who charged a flat fee of citizens and businesses. In each of the clashes the Autodefensas have used high caliber weapons, which have led to different conflicts with the Mexican army. * When newly emerged, they retained a group of SEDENA commanders, in an attempt to force dialogue and avoid being disarmed. * There were clashes between soldiers and paramilitaries when first trying to disarm the Autodefensas. * In a demonstration by the Autodefensas, a branch of the Mexican army was surrounded and threatened by a crowd of protesters. The army shot several rounds at the unarmed crowd; the incident left 2 dead and 2 injured; the casualties have been identified by both the government and the Autodefensas as Michoac√°n cartel members who had infiltrated the protest to spy on the real Autodefensas. * The government leader of the Rural Defense police, Alfredo Castillo Cervantes, was removed after rumors that a cartel bribed him to allow cartel members to join the organization and to spy on the Rural Police's members who were former Autodefensas. By late 2015, it was believed that all cartel members had been removed from the Rural Police groups. Castillo was reassigned to a position that gave him a kind of sports authority, and was not investigated further. * Hip√≥lito Mora, a Self-Defense leader was arrested in early 2015 and charged for an alleged vigilante/revenge murder. He was released almost two months later. * Dr. Mireles Valverde, the spokesman of the Self-Defense counsel, was arrested for collecting firearms not registered with the SEDENA. * Groups of \\"La Ruana\\" Rural force became upset because most of their weapons have not been returned by the government, they claim to have few weapons to fight the heavily armed criminals. * The government has declared that there are some fake-Autodefensas, not affiliated with the federal government (Castillo's; see above), that are actually working for the recently created Jalisco's New- Generation Cartel.  Regulation  Most self-defense groups have been converted into bodies of village guards or rural force, the first under the command of the SEDENA and the second under the command of the State Police, although several groups remain without registering their weapons.  Known groups  The Community Police have several formations in the state of Guerrero, mainly in the region of the Costa-Chica hills and Mountain range, and in the town of Balsas, bordering the state of Morelos. There are several groups in Michoac√°n, in the region of Tierra-Caliente, and also in the Cheran municipality (which has an indigenous-community based structure, very different to the rest of autodefensas) as well as in Chapala. In Jalisco and Tamaulipas some self-defense groups have appeared, but it is suspected that they are members of the Gulf Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

Since its opening in 1942, it has undergone many transformations. The museum is dedicated to Spanish art from the 18th to the 20th century and to the Basque art from the period 1850-1950. History Augustin-Zulueta Palace In 1912, Elvira Zulueta and Ricardo Augustin started the construction of their private residence in the street Fray Francisco; what today is known as the Palace of Augustin. Elvira, daughter of Juli√°n de Zulueta, belonged to a wealthy family in Vitoria, and after her marriage in 1905 with Ricardo Augustin, they decided to build a mansion in Vitoria's wealthy neighborhood. The management of the project was entrusted to the architects Julian Apraiz (1876-1962) and Francisco Javier de Luque (1871-1941), who had won the competition for designing Vitoria's new Cathedral in 1906. The work, which was very complex for that time, was completed in 1916. However, in September 1917, Elvira, died suddenly and Ricardo Augustin gradually abandoned the city, leaving the Palace empty for much of the year. In 1924 he reached an agreement with the diocese to begin construction of a seminary on part of the property, while he retained the area around the palace. As a thank, Augustin received the Papal title of \\"Count of Davila\\" in the 1920s. The count continued to be linked to the province until his death in 1965 and is buried along with his wife in the chapel of the Diocesan Seminary. View from the Palace gardens The Museum and its collections The idea of creating a Museum in √Ålava dated back over a century. In 1792 the Royal Basque Society kept a library and a collection of Roman tombstones in the old Seminary Church of Aguirre de Vitoria. In 1844 the civil Governor established a \\"Gallery of Pictures\\" in a room of the Palace House. At the end of the 19th century, Federico Baraibar had gathered archaeological remains in what he called the \\"Incipient Museum\\" in the halls of the secondary school, which later served as the meeting place of the Basque Parliament. In addition, a school of Arts and crafts hosted rooms with works, primarily from local artists. For years, the local press had urged the creation of a Museum, and this is reflected in 1940 with the creation of the Culture Council of the provincial Council of √Ålava, one of whose main objectives was the establishment and operation of the Museum, library and provincial archive. The first step was taken in 1941 with the purchase of the Palace of Augustin, destined to accommodate, under the name of Casa de √Ålava, both collections related to fine arts and archaeology as well as the library and the archive of the province. As a Museum, the Diocese of Vitoria donated religious art. Other donations came from the Museo del Prado and private individuals. In 1975, the museum began a systematic process of collecting contemporary art, enriched in the successive decades to constitute one of the most complete and coherent throughout the Spanish State. At the same time, the other large collection of works of this Museum, the Basque art, moved for exhibition to a location just opposite the Palace of Ajuria Enea for a brief time, from 1978 to 1980. That year, it became the official residence of the President and funds were returned to the provincial Museum. Another prominent date was 1986 when the Diputaci√≥n Foral de √Ålava acquired an important collection of playing cards from F√©lix Alfaro Fournier (1895-1989), which they displayed until the Museum of Fournier de Naipes was incorporated into the new Museo Bibat. Since 1999, the Museum collection has had exhibits ranging from the 13th century to the present day, including a section devoted to numismatics and an open air Museum of contemporary sculpture. At present the Museum of fine arts of √Ålava is divided in four sections, consisting of the original building, the Palace Augustin Zulueta; an area of expansion from the 1960s; and the annex where access to the Museum is located. In this renovation, carried out between the years 1999-2001, the whole has been refurbished, architectural barriers have been eliminated and access improved with additional services for visitors. View of the 2001 additions, with the new entrance Current collection The tour begins in the rooms of the ground floor dedicated to Basque art from 1850-1950, where you can see the evolution of the painting on the basis of pioneering artists such as Juan Angel S√°ez (1811-1873), Antonio Lecuona, Eduardo Zamacois y Zabala and Jose Etxenagusia, among others. The display continues with the works of innovative artists such as Adolfo Guiard, Dar√≠o de Regoyos and Juan de Echevarr√≠a, to the most outstanding artists of the period prior to the outbreak of the civil war, such as Juli√°n de Tellaeche (1884-1957). Also on the first floor, one may find other works by Basque artists; large format works by Ignacio Zuloaga, Aurelio Arteta, El√≠as Salaverria, Francisco Iturrino and the brothers Ram√≥n and Valent√≠n de Zubiaurre, works in which the traditional artistic languages meet with the most modern. The second floor is dedicated to Fernando de Am√°rica, with works donated by his foundation for permanent display. The chronological journey allows you to follow the succession of stylistic trends used throughout his long career (realism, impressionism, expressionism). Located in the zone corresponding to the Palace of Augustin, the collection of Spanish art from the 18th to the 20th century, shown through portraits, landscapes and scenes depicting local customs, illustrates the transition from classical and academic painting to more spontaneous romantic styles and painters from the realist movement. The portraits of Vicente L√≥pez Porta√±a and Federico and Raimundo de Madrazo, the landscapes of Carlos de Haes, Aureliano de Beruete and the mural sketches of Josep Maria Sert are a good example of this.

In Dumfries, her acting came to the attention of Robert Burns, who wrote a number of poems for her. Early life Fontenelle was born in London on 31 August 1769, the daughter of John and Ann Fontenell.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography She was sent to boarding school, after which, having \\"discovered so much agreeable vivacity\\",Thespian Dictionary, 1805 she was persuaded by friends to take up acting as a career. Early career Fontenelle was recommended by the proprietor of the Public Advertiser, Henry Sampson Woodfall, who wrote to Thomas Harris, proprietor of the Covent Garden Theatre. The result of his submission was that in 1788 Fontenelle appeared as Moggy McGilpin, the heroine in John O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs comic opera, The Highland Reel. The show was a huge success and immediately launched her acting career. A newspaper reviewer on the morning following the opening declared: \\"Miss Fontanelle, as a breeches figure, will rank with Jordan and Mrs Goodall.\\" A biographical dictionary of actors, actresses, musicians, dancers, managers & other stage personnel in London 1660-1800 Following her success in her debut role, she appeared as Sophia in John O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs The Toy and a controversial female MacHeath in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. She was in the cast of Such Things Have Been and went on to play Mademoiselle D'Epingle in Richard Steele's The Funeral. After her benefit night on 2 May 1789, Fontenelle received adverse criticism for overacting and she and Thomas Harris parted company. She went north to join the company at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, where she played in various roles for a season before returning to London to play at the Haymarket Theatre. Louisa was engaged by George Colman at the Haymarket Theatre to replace Miss George, who was now playing at the Theatre Royal, Dublin. She played there for four summer seasons, 1790 to 1793, but in the winter seasons played in Theatre Royal in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dumfries. Fontenelle and Robert Burns It was while she was playing at the Theatre Royal, Dumfries that she caught the eye of Robert Burns, who wrote a Prologue for her to recite at her benefit night on 26 November 1792 on the Rights of Women. This was accompanied by a letter in which he wrote, \\"To you, Madam, on our humble Dumfries boards, I have been more indebted for entertainment, than ever I was in prouder Theatres. Your charms as a woman would ensure applause to the most indifferent Actress, and your theatrical talents would secure admiration to the plainest figure.\\"http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/FontenelleLouisa177315199.363.shtml The Burns Encyclopaedia online: Louisa Fontenelle In December of the following year, Burns wrote another address for her benefit night. He also wrote a poem for her entitled To Miss Fontenelle, on Seeing her in a Favorite Character. Marriage and emigration While at Dumfries, she also caught the eye of, and later married, the theatre manager, John Brown Williamson, a friend of Burns. Shortly after they were married, in 1796, the couple emigrated to Boston, America. In their American debuts in the Boston Theatre, John played the Moor in Othello and Louisa 'Little Pickle' in Bickerstaff's The Spoil'd Child. Williamson's acting was criticised in that he \\"lacked flexibility of countenance.\\" Fontenelle's role, on the other hand, was described as \\"the most astonishing and brilliant display of theatrical genius ever exhibited in America.\\"A History of the American Theatre (first published 1888-91) After their first season, Williamson became manager of the Boston Theatre but his \\"unfortunate habit of undervaluing everything American\\" led to failure \\"through a want of co-operation and support from the stockholder.\\" They later joined the Charleston Company of Actors in South Carolina and played in Boston and New York.

The network currently has over-the-air coverage on eight owned-and- operated stations and 220 affiliates available on analog, low-power or digital broadcast signals (primarily covering the 100 largest Nielsen-designated markets with moderate over-the-air coverage in smaller markets); and 17 additional local affiliates distributed exclusively through cable television providers. Counting only its broadcast affiliates, The CW covers 99.80% of all households in the United States with at least one television set. The following article is a listing of CW-affiliated television stations, arranged alphabetically by state and territory, and based on the station's city of license and followed in parentheses by the Designated Market Area if differing from the city of license. There are links to and articles on most of the stations, describing their histories, local programming and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies. For broadcast affiliates, the station's advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is the station's virtual channel (PSIP) number. Stations listed in boldface are owned and operated by CBS Television Stations, a corporate sister to The CW via network co-parent CBS Corporation. Stations listed with the superscript identification CW+ are broadcast or cable affiliates of The CW Plus, an alternate feed distributed mainly to areas ranked among the 110 smallest U.S. television markets, which alongside CW network programming, carries syndicated and brokered programs acquired and scheduled by the network.

This is done in a shorter duration of time with a high riveting rate. The process is fast, robust, and is flexible in nature; thus improving its usage and providing reliability to the riveted joint along with the final product quality. CNC riveting can be used for a variety of operations ranging from riveting and fastening belts, skin panels, shear ties, and other internal fuselage components. The CNC Riveting machines generally consist of a solid frame made of welded steel and aluminum frames used for protection fitted with polycarbonate panes. The dynamic drive of the coordinates axes is achieved by a recirculating ball and screw, servo motors and motion control units that make the high-speed movement possible. For the mounting of the riveting units, solid C Frames are used. The riveting program can be given various parameters and these can be changed or altered as desired to be CNC programs as per the requirement.  CNC riveting machine variants   CNC duct riveting cell  A CNC controlled automatic riveting work cell with a knee type design drill machine that has sixty-inch throat depth with four positions on the upper head. This machine can apply sixteen pounds of upset force. This machine is equipped with dual drill spindles, one for carrying out drilling and other for deburring. It was developed for the fabrication of tubular assemblies, which are fed into the throat of the machine over an eight-inch square lower knee. The CNC controlled four axis positioning system presents the part to the machine that carries out the riveting.  CNC riveting machines with stationary machine table  These CNC machines act as stand-alone workstations for heavy and bigger workpieces. They are simple in design and require work holding fixtures only, so the clamping and component query devices are much more affordable.  CNC riveting machines with Indexing Tables  These special purpose CNC riveting machines have different sizes of indexing tables that be composed of different coordinate axes and riveting machines. These machines have different versions for the particular application and are configured accordingly. The coordinate system has linear units and recirculating ball screws, and an index table that is electrically operated with a brake motor. It has two to four fixed indexing stations, and the index table are NC flexible rotary indexing tables which are actuated by two hand controls or by a pedal switch. The machine has an automatic tool changer.  CNC riveting machines with transfer system  These CNC riveting machines are made for use in manufacturing lines. The fixtures are coded and interfaces are customized to make the connection of several CNC riveting machines and linking them with other manufacturing systems, making it possible to obtain a high degree of automation.  Multiple axes CNC riveting cell  This is the latest technological development in automated fastening. This technology is versatile and can be used for riveting of high curvature fuselage panels to low curvature wing panels, bulkheads, floor etc. The tooling changeover is minimized thus part throughput is maximized.  Advantages  The main advantages of this type of CNC riveting machine are that it can use a variable minimum distance between rivets, and rivets of different length or heights can be used. High flexibility and change over time due to programmable memory. It can process many workpieces and different rivets can be used in one operation. Picking and placing operations are done in parallel with the primary operation time, saving money. Menu based navigation makes the programming fluid.

He was the starting quarterback for the University of Texas in 1941, leading them to the school's first ever #1 ranking and the cover of the Nov 17, 1941 Life Magazine. He was drafted in the 2nd round of the 1942 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played one year of professional football. Early life Vernon Martin was born in Amarillo on May 2, 1920. He played football at Amarillo High School and was a part of the Sanies 1936 undefeated State Championship team. He also was on the basketball team. College football Martin started college at the University of Texas in 1938 playing on a freshman team that went 2-1. He was a starter at the beginning of the 1939 season, but was badly injured in the second game of the year against Wisconsin. He suffered an internal injury, and was rushed to the infirmary. He spent 10 days in the hospital and missed the rest of the season. Martin recovered and was the starting quarterback, also known as the blocking back at the time, of the Texas Longhorns in 1940 and 1941. In 1940, the Longhorns went 8-2, but the highlight of the year came in the Thanksgiving Day upset of #2 Texas A&M.; A&M; was undefeated and the defending National Champion and the upset was such that the 13 Longhorns who played that day, of which Martin was one, were known at the time as \\"The Immortal Thirteen.\\" The Longhorns came into 1941 a highly regarded team, and it was perhaps the most impactful squad in the history of the program. It was the first Longhorn team to reach #1 in the rankings, produced the first consensus All-American, won the first Golden Hat as part of the annual game with Oklahoma, and was the team that inspired the red candle hex rally prior to Texas A&M; games. Pete Layden was the fullback, who in the offense of the time did most of the passing and ball- handling, but Martin called most of the plays. The Longhorns won their first six games, by lopsided margins, to earn the #1 ranking and were then featured on the cover of Life magazine. They immediately suffered a 7-7 tie to Baylor and a 14-7 loss to TCU, mostly due to four injured starters, to drop to #10 before again upsetting Texas A&M; who was again ranked #2 at the time. They finished the season with a 71-7 drumming of Oregon and at the end of the game, Martin caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Layden for Martin's only touchdown of the year. Texas finished the season ranked #4, the first time Texas ever finished the season ranked, and Martin was named second team All-Conference. Martin also made Wirt Gammon's All-American Blockers team that year. The 1941 Longhorns were considered the greatest Texas team ever at the time. Pro football and military service Following the season, Martin was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2nd round of the 1942 NFL Draft. He played blocking back for the Steelers in 1942, catching several passes and scoring two touchdowns. He later joined the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and become a Flight Officer stationed in Shamshernagar, India, flying airlift missions over the Hump. In June 1945, the AAF announced plans to form seven football teams and in August, Martin was selected to ship out to Berry Field in Nashville to play for the Air Transport Command Rockets that year. Playing in an all-service league, the Rockets went 2-3-2 and finished ranked #11 in the Williamson Service Rankings. Martin died in 1949 in a car crash in Memphis.

Plot Fred recently has had an extreme obsession with nets, as most of his plans to catch the monsters Mystery Inc. encounter are caught with nets. To get them out of his mind, Scooby and the gang decide to take a vacation in Florida, where Daphne's uncle Sandy owns a hotel, only to find that it is being haunted by a shape-shifting sea monster that is stealing jewelry. During their first encounter with it, Fred tries to use a net, but to no avail. Daphne tries to help Fred with his net problem by getting him to relax in an area without nets, which is difficult, since the lobby and beach have nets all over the place. Velma goes to Kurt's hotel, the rival hotel next door. Kurt is somewhat glad about the commotion, as the people who have left Sandy's hotel in fear of the monster have come to his hotel. However, a holographic water show, which is supposed to be a big attraction at Kurt's hotel, is closed for repairs, and the repair company, Brownstone Industries, is taking too much time to fix it. Meanwhile, Shaggy is sad that Scooby is spending too much time with another guest's dog. Shaggy finds comfort with Kiki Brownstone, the female dog's owner, and the wife of Grafton Brownstone. Kiki, like Shaggy, also feels lonely, as her dog is with Scooby and her husband is nowhere to be found. Later in the night, the hotel is attacked again by the monster, and is attracted to Kiki's necklace. Using the necklace as bait, the gang gets the monster to follow them, noticing a human silhouette in the center. Velma tells Fred to find them a net, which he builds out of video cassettes. The monster wraps a tentacle around Velma as Fred is ready to capture it. Fred successfully captures the person behind the monster, which turns out be Grafton Brownstone, Kiki's husband, and head of Brownstone Industries. Grafton had actually pawned Kiki's necklace for money, and the necklace that Kiki was wearing was fake. In order to prevent Kiki from finding out, he planned on stealing the necklace.

The franchise is best known for its third-person shooter video games, which has been supplemented by spin-off video game titles, a comic book series, seven novels, a board game adaptation and various merchandise. The original trilogy focuses on the conflict between humanity and the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde on the world of Sera. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), featured a three-way conflict between humanity, the Locust Horde and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent. Gears of War: Judgment, a spin-off prequel to the series' first title, was released in 2013; it focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. The fifth instalment in the series, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD and his friends as they battle security forces deployed by a totalitarian COG government as well as the Swarm, a reconstituted version of the Locust Horde that once again threatens humanity. Gears 5 (2019) is the direct sequel to Gears of War 4 and revolves around Kait Diaz, a friend of JD, who embarks on a quest to learn the truth about her past and the connections between her heritage and the Locust Horde. Gears of War was developed by Epic Games. Cliff Bleszinski, who has previously worked on Epic's Unreal Tournament games, served as the series' lead game designer for the first three installments. He was inspired by gameplay elements from Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Bionic Commando. The series was also guided by Rod Fergusson, the executive producer and director of development of Epic Games until 2012. The first four installments of the Gears of War series used a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 engine. On January 27, 2014, Microsoft acquired rights to the franchise from Epic Games. Canadian studio The Coalition developed Gears of War 4, which was released on October 11, 2016 for the Xbox One and Windows 10. A sequel, Gears 5, was released on September 10, 2019. All six installments in Gears of War featured several multiplayer modes that allowed players to compete against each other or team-up to battle AI opponents on Xbox Live. Gears of War became one of the best-selling franchises for the Xbox 360. The series is well known for its emphasis on cover-based combat, in which players can use objects to avoid gunfire or safely engage enemies. The Gears of War games have been amongst the most popular and most played titles on Xbox Live. Plot The Gears of War series takes place on Sera, a fictional Earth- like planet. Human civilization develops on Sera and endures a millennia-long conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of extinction. Sera's leaders broker an era of peace that ushers an era of scientific advancements and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's population sporadically grows and demands more energy provided by fossil and nuclear fuels. Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a naturally occurring substance that can be refined into a potent energy source. Imulsion solves Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates great economic disparity. Nations with direct access to Imulsion prosper, while other nations fall into financial turmoil. Sera's citizens balkanize into two warring factions: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The ensuing 79-year strife, known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR develops the 'Hammer of Dawn', a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and potent orbital-to-surface laser strikes. However, a contingent of COG commandos, led by Marcus Fenix, Dominic Santiago, and Victor Hoffman launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold and steal the schematics for the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR surrenders after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn devastate one of their naval vessels after being completed by Marcus Fenix's father, scientist Adam Fenix. Six weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of creatures known as the Locust Horde emerge from Sera's depths and begin assaulting human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the first 26 hours. The Locust Horde overwhelms the already battleworn COG forces during this surprise attack, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The COG retreats to cities located on the Jacinto Plateau, their last bastion where the Locust cannot dig through, and reluctantly bombard their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust Horde's offensive. The ensuing scorched earth tactic destroys much of Sera's cities and human population. The COG continues to operate out of the capital city of Ephyra and cities on the plateau such as Jacinto, while the surviving humans, known as Stranded, are left to wander through Sera's charred ruins. Five years after Emergence Day, the Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities located on the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones in order to destroy Ephyra. The Locust are able to emerge and overrun the COG capital of Ephyra ten years after Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized mission to save his father, Adam, from the Locust assault. A helicopter is shot down by the Locust Horde and crash-lands into the Fenix estate, presumably killing Adam Fenix. The COG's leadership court martials Marcus and sentences him to life imprisonment. After losing Ephyra, the remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City, which resides on the edge of the plateau against an ocean. Gears of War is set fourteen years after the Locust emerged and attacked Sera's human population. The COG forces devise a last-ditch offensive to destroy the Locust Horde with the Lightmass Bomb, weaponized forms of Imulsion. Marcus Fenix, now a disgraced veteran, is reinstated into the COG army four years after imprisonment to supplement the COG's depleted ranks. Marcus joins his best friend, Dominic Santiago, on a mission to map the Locust Horde's tunnel network in preparation for the bombing. Their unit is ambushed by Locust Ground forces and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix and Santiago regroup with two other survivors, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, and continue their mission. Marcus prevails in mapping and successfully deploying the Lightmass Bomb and crippling the Locust Horde. The Locust Queen Myrrah pledges to continue the war effort. In the weeks following the Lightmass Bombing, the human population suffers from a condition known as Rustlung, a fatal disease caused by the inhalation of Imulsion fumes - due to the evaporation of Imulsion caused by the Lightmass Bomb. The Locust reemerge and bring with them a force allowing them to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. Following the sinking of nearby cities Tollen and Montevado, and the desperate raid attacks on Jacinto City, the COG fears that the Locust might be trying to sink Jacinto as well. In Gears of War 2, the COG forces deploy thousands of soldiers into the depths of Sera to battle the Locust Horde and stop their plans to sink Jacinto. The COG discovers after the sinking of Ilima City that the Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. After killing the Riftworm, Delta Squad is ordered to locate the Locust stronghold by accessing intel from a decommissioned COG laboratory called New Hope, which is full of genetically altered humans called Sires, which Marcus believes were experiments that led to the creation of the Locust Horde. Locating the Locust stronghold Nexus under Mount Kadar, the COG discovers during the battle that members of the Locust Horde are mutating from exposure from Imulsion into \\"Lambent\\". These abominations have been forcing the Locust to abandon their underground civilization to try to claim the surface world as their new home. Marcus devises a plan to intentionally sink Jacinto and using the surrounding sea water to flood the Locust and Lambent tunnel network. The COG evacuate Jacinto just as the city collapses and drowns a majority of the Locust Horde. The remaining population of the COG rediscover an island base not attacked by the Locust Horde called Vectes, with a town known as Pelruan. The Stranded gangs on the island threaten the safety of the town, but the COG and Stranded cease when the Lambent begin to overrun the island and surrounding ocean. Due to the underground being flooded, the Imulsion from the Hollow was raised into the surface of Sera, causing a pandemic and turning all life into Lambent organisms. The leader of the COG, Chairman Richard Prescott, is believed to be holding secrets from the population. Prescott abandons the COG, forcing them to disband and live as nomads, surviving against the Lambent and Locust stragglers. Gears of War 3 is set two years after the COG disbanded. Prescott returns to reveal that he kidnapped Marcus Fenix's father during the fall of Ephyra and transported him to a secret island facility known as Azura, and that Adam has created a device known as the Imulsion countermeasure that could neutralize both the Lambent and Locust. However, the island was attacked and is occupied by Queen Myrrah and the remaining Locust forces. Marcus and his allies reach Azura after Dominic sacrifices himself to rescue his friends from imminent demise. Adam is rescued and releases his anti-Imulsion weapon but reveals he infected himself with the Lambent contagion to develop the weapon. The Imulsion countermeasure vaporizes all Lambent, including Adam, and crystallizes the Locust. Marcus kills Myrrah and dedicates her demise to his fallen friends, family, and comrades. Gears of War: Judgment focuses on Baird and Cole during the early months after Emergence Day. With military cadet Sofia Hendrick and Garron Paduk, a former UIR soldier, they comprise the Kilo Squad. Baird disobeys orders to use a Lightmass Missile to destroy Locust forces and save survivors at Halvo Bay. Despite also killing the powerful Locust leader Karn, the squad is court-martialed because they disobeyed orders. But because they saved Col. Ezra Loomis and killed Karn, they avoid execution or imprisonment, with Baird demoted from lieutenant to private. A separate campaign, \\"Aftermath\\", portrays Baird, Cole, and Paduk in the hours before the activation of the anti-Imulsion energy wave. Following the end of the Locust War and Lambent Pandemic, the humans of Sera began to rebuild and started with reorganizing the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Led by First Minister Anya Stroud, wife of Marcus Fenix, the humans begin to rebuild civilization with the assistance of robotic engineers created by Damon Baird. The COG was successful in creating New Ephyra and other walled cities known as Settlements outside of New Ephyra. Following fertility treatment, Anya was able to bear Marcus Fenix's son, James Dominic \\"JD\\" Fenix. Anya died from birthing complications and the COG began a more authoritarian rule - prompting many civilians to abandon the COG and live off the land, known as Outsiders. JD was sent to boarding school and met his friend Delmont \\"Del\\" Walker. After joining the military, both JD and Del were forced to execute civilians during a protest in Settlement 2, prompting them to leave the COG and becoming Outsiders. They joined a village led by Reyna Diaz and her brother-in-law, Oscar. Reyna's daughter, Kait, became close with JD and Del. Gears of War 4 takes place 25 years after the original Gears of War trilogy. JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, a disgruntled COG expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they are behind a string of kidnappings. The four reach a Locust burial site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities. However, they reach the hive to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna. Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer. Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother ‚Äì a necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah. Kait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. Kait begins to have nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer of Dawn satellites at Azura. In Gears 5, JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements. Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the humans, including her uncle. She is freed by Marcus and JD, but in her grief reveals that she has been having visions and nightmares and believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet which bears the Locust symbol. Marcus has Kait and Del find answers at the New Hope facility. After discovering New Hope and an additional lab in Mount Kadar, Kait and Del learn that the Locust were the result of genetic experiments done to human children sick with Rustlung and splicing them with the DNA of creatures in the Hollow. The mutant children, known as Sires, were used to fertilize the stem cells of Myrrah, who was born with a genetic immunity to Imulsion. Kait discovers that Myrrah was Reyna's mother, making Kait the next in line for Queen of the Swarm. She manages to disconnect herself from the Swarm hivemind, but in doing so allowed Reyna to be awoken and become queen of the Swarm. The Swarm becomes stronger and more intelligent now that they have a queen and launch an attack against New Ephyra. Using the Hammer of Dawn, the COG is able to repel the Swarm attack, and Kait vows to kill Queen Reyna before she can attack again. Gameplay cover. The game uses an over-the- shoulder camera angle when displaying the targeting reticle. Gears of War is a third-person shooter game, with its core concepts being derived from Resident Evil 4s \\"over the shoulder\\" perspective, Kill Switchs cover system, and Bionic Commandos swinging action akin to moving between points of cover. The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around the cover and aim carefully, though exposing to enemy fire; the player can slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes damage, the \\"Crimson Omen\\" appears on the HUD, becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player may be able to recover from this state on their own, or may die after a short amount of time if not revived. When a combatant is down, a member of the other side may attempt to execute the downed player via a \\"curb stomp\\" or other brutal methods. Some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games; they are referred to as \\"acts\\" and each act is formed into a certain amount of chapters. Players in Gears of War can carry four different weapons, with the exception of the fourth game, allowing two primary weapon slots that can carry weapons which include, but are not limited to: assault rifles, shotguns, a sniper rifle, grenade launchers and an explosive bow; one grenade slot, which may be filled with up to four grenades of a specific type (Fragmentation, Smoke, Ink and Incendiary), and one pistol-type weapon. Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps. Most weapons feature the \\"Active Reload\\" ability: either after a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a manual reload, a meter is shown on screen, and the player can attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area. If the player stops the meter in the marked area, their reload will be completed faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload, and if the player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area, they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded shot and a faster reload. If the player stops the meter outside this area, their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the reload time. While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter archetypes, Gears of Wars signature weapon is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted chainsaw bayonet which can be used in close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe. Most other weapons =can be used to bash opponents in melee, or in the case of grenades, can be stuck to a foe, exploding a few seconds later. In Gears of War 2 and Gears of War 3, all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable surface, detonating when an opponent comes close to it. If the opponent spots the grenade, they can detonate it from a safe distance by shooting it. All Gears of War games feature a campaign mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player. The two players take the roles of two COG soldiers, Marcus Fenix and Dominic \\"Dom\\" Santiago, as they fight the Locust. In the third game the campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same time. The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty. At various times, the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first player can select; if the second player is present, they will be forced to take the other path. The third and fourth players in Gears of War 3 will be separated between the paths of the first and second players. In these areas, all players generally have to work together to get them through the section, such as by one player providing covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the first player to proceed. The competitive multiplayer mode in Gears of War features 8 players while in Gears of War 2 features up to ten players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay types. Modes include \\"Warzone\\" and \\"Execution\\", both similar to a typical deathmatch, and \\"Annex\\" and \\"King of the Hill\\" where teams have to control a marked zone on the map. In the mode \\"Guardian\\" (only in Gears of War 2) one member of each team is designated as the leader. As long as the leader is still alive, their teammates can respawn indefinitely. As soon as the leader is executed, their teammates can no longer respawn. Gears of War 3 features better AI, as in past games the AI went around the obstacle even if it had been destroyed. However, in Gears of War 3 the AI will recognize that the obstacle has been destroyed and are free to walk over it.\\"Gears of War 3,\\" Game Informer 206 (June 2010): p40-49.

Designed by Corey Konieczka, it is a cooperative game for up to four players, including the option for solo play. Each player takes control of a COG (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in red), fighting their way through randomly generated maps filled with Locust soldiers (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in light gray). These are controlled by an AI deck of cards: after each player finishes their turn, they draw a card from the AI deck and takes actions for each Locust creature. Players play cards and roll dice to take actions as well as to resolve shooting and defense. The game proceeds until the player team successfully completes the mission. There are seven different missions, each featuring different objectives and enemies in randomly generated map layouts. Since its launch, the game has received one expansion, Mission Pack 1, which brought more weapons, two new missions and new enemies, including General RAAM.

Producer Wyck Godfrey said of the film adaptation, \\"I'm not a gamer, but what blew me away about Gears was how it captures the mythology of a war mission and how high the stakes are.\\" On August 3, 2007, it was reported that Len Wiseman was to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War, though on March 30, 2007, Godfrey stated that they have \\"a director we're about to attach\\" in order to film the movie during 2009 and release in 2010. Cliff Bleszinski, the lead designer of the Gears of War video games, will serve as executive producer and consultant. Wiseman signed on in June 2008, with Chris Morgan performing script rewrites. Morgan hinted on G4's televised coverage of Comic Con 2008 that the film would be a prequel to the first game, \\"it could explain how Marcus Fenix got his scar.\\" According to Morgan, Wiseman \\"wants to make it as realistic as possible, and to blur those lines where your mind says, 'Oh, it's a big CGI film.. On December 8, 2009, Wyck Godfrey sad that the intention of the Gears of War film was \\"to tell the epic story of an alien planet that's living in a horrific environment just feels like the wrong mood right now\\". In April 2010, New Line considerably scaled back the $100 million budget and story, stalling progress while they waited for a rewrite. Len Wiseman was no longer involved as he shifted his focus to other projects. In April 2013, Variety reported that \\"Creative Artists Agency is eager to meet with producers in the coming weeks and set up the project elsewhere,\\" and that Stuart Beattie will write the film. Scott Stuber is named to produce the film. At the launch ceremony for Gears of War 4 in October 2016, The Coalition's Rod Fergusson affirmed that a Gears of War movie is currently at development at Universal Pictures. Scott Stuber and Dylan Clark will produce the film under Universal's Bluegrass Films division, but no director or writer has been selected at this point. Fergusson also stated that where the film takes place relative to the games has been determined. On May 3, 2017, Universal hired Shane Salerno to write the screenplay with Fergusson stating, \\"the movie won't be based on one of the games but a new story set in the universe.\\" On November 28, 2018, The Wrap reported that F. Scott Frazier will write the film's script. On June 17, 2019, IGN reported that the movie won't be set in the game franchise. Merchandise In July 2007, NECA announced they would be producing Gears of War merchandise, including action figures. The first series, available in the second quarter of 2008, included Augustus Cole, Anthony Carmine, Baird, a Locust Drone, a Locust Sniper, Dom Santiago and Marcus Fenix. TriForce Sales has obtained a license from Epic Games to create full-scale replicas of the armor and weapons from the game, with assistance of sculptor Sid Garrand of Nightmare Armor Studios. The units were available for advanced order in July 2008. Mindzeye Studios has created foot high statues of Gears of War characters.\\"GI's 2008 Holiday Buying Guide,\\" Game Informer 188 (December 2008): 40. Reception All of the Gears of War titles have been received positively, and the original trilogy is critically acclaimed. IGN rated Gears of War 3 the 22nd best Xbox 360 game, out of a list of 25. In 2010, Lasse Pulkkinen from Techno Buffalo called Gears of War 2 the best looking game on the Xbox 360. In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Augustus Cole as the 46th-top video game character of all time. Sales According to Microsoft, the Gears of War series has sold over 22 million units and earned over US$1 billion in revenue as of January 2014. Legal issues In January 2017, former American football player Lenwood Hamilton sued Epic Games, Microsoft, and voice actor Lester Speight, stating that the character of Cole Train in the series steals from his own likeness and voice. The lawsuit contends that elements of Cole's character, including being of African-American descent, having played in professional sports, and elements of the character's clothing were all elements representative of Hamilton, and voice analysis shows that Speight's delivery of Cole's lines matches too close with Hamilton's line. Hamilton had stated that Speight had approached him around 1998 about a video game, though Hamilton had turned it down due to the violence that would be in the game. Lenwood was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid; \\"The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on First Amendment grounds, holding that defendants' First Amendment right to free expression in creating the Cole character that allegedly resembled plaintiff outweighed plaintiff's right of publicity.\\" Legacy Former Naughty Dog developer Lucas Pope has stated that the Uncharted franchise drew inspiration from Gears of War, with the first game in the series being delayed after the first Gears of War game released in order for certain core gameplay and technical elements to more resemble that of the latter.

The name Zanes was the plural of Zeus in the local dialect.Œ•œÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç (2012) ŒüŒ¥œÖœÉœÉŒµœçœÇ - ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØ ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩŒµœÇ. These statues were dedicated to Zeus and they were erected with the money of fines imposed by the judges to those athletes did not respect or violated the rules of the Olympic Games.Description of Greece, 5.21.2 Besides the fines, the judges also imposed body punishments or exclusion of an athlete from the Games depending on how severe their violation was. Today, only 16 pedestals (stone bases) of the statues survive. They are located one next to the other in front of the monumental entrance to the stadium, the Krypte. The reason they were placed in such a highly visible location was to dissuade other athletes from cheating. In ancient times, there were 16 bronze statues of Zeus on those pedestals but they do not survive today. The Zanes statues were crafted by great artists of their time. According to Pausanias, the pedestals were inscribed with short texts mentioning the name of the offender; these were to make it clear that Olympic victories were to be won by feats of strength, rather than bought with moneyPausanias, Description of Greece, 5.21.4. The inscription of an athlete's name on such a pedestal was shameful both for him and for his city. According to Pausanias, the first of the Zanes were erected when Eupolos from Thessaly was fined for bribing three of his opponents in the boxing eventPausanias, Description of Greece, 5.21.3. The remaining six statues were erected later on by the Athenian Kallipos, an athlete of the Pankration (\\"all force\\" wrestling), who also bribed his opponents.

Droplet sizes range from < 5 ¬µm to 1000 ¬µm, however the distinction between respiratory droplets and aerosols, with this arbitrary cutoff has never been supported experimentally or theoretically. Large droplets (larger than about 100 ¬µm, but depending on conditions) fall to the ground or another surface before drying, but smaller ones fall slowly and dry so quickly that they usually become aerosolized particles. Respiratory droplets can be produced naturally as a result of breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing, or vomiting, or can be artificially generated through aerosol-generating medical procedures. Since droplets can contain infectious bacterial cells or virus particles they are important factors in the transmission of respiratory diseases. Description Respiratory droplets from humans include various cells types (e.g. epithelial cells and cells of the immune system), physiological electrolytes contained in mucous and saliva (e.g. Na+, K+, Cl‚àí), and, potentially, various pathogens. Droplets that dry in the air become droplet nuclei which float as aerosols and can remain suspended in air for considerable periods of time.  Formation Respiratory droplets can be produced in many ways. They can be produced naturally as a result of breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing, or singing. They can also be artificially generated in a healthcare setting through aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), bronchoscopy, surgery, and autopsy. Similar droplets may be formed through vomiting, flushing toilets, wet-cleaning surfaces, showering or using tap water, or spraying graywater for agricultural purposes. Depending on the method of formation, respiratory droplets may also contain salts, cells, and virus particles. In the case of naturally produced droplets, they can originate from different locations in the respiratory tract, which may affect their content. There may also be differences between healthy and diseased individuals in their mucus content, quantity, and viscosity that affects droplet formation. Transport Human cough: effect of wind speed on the transport of respiratory droplets.Talib Dbouk and Dimitris Drikakis: On Coughing and Airborne Transmission to Humans. Physics of Fluids, 32, 053310, 19 May 2020. Different methods of formation create droplets of different size and initial speed, which affect their transport and fate in the air. As described by the Wells curve, the largest droplets fall sufficiently fast that they usually settle to the ground or another surface before drying out, and droplets smaller than 100 Œºm will rapidly dry out, before settling on a surface. Once dry, they become solid droplet nuclei consisting of the non- volatile matter initially in the droplet. Respiratory droplets can also interact with other particles of non-biological origin in the air, which are more numerous than them. When people are in close contact, liquid droplets produced by one person may be inhaled by another person; droplets larger than 10 Œºm tend to remain trapped in the nose and throat while smaller droplets will penetrate to the lower respiratory system. Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) showed that at wind speeds varying from 4 to 15 km/h, respiratory droplets may travel up to 6 meters.  Role in disease transmission  A poster outlining precautions for droplet transmission in healthcare settings. A common form of disease transmission is by way of respiratory droplets, generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Respiratory droplet transmission is the usual route for respiratory infections. Transmission can occur when respiratory droplets reach susceptible mucosal surfaces, such as in the eyes, nose or mouth. This can also happen indirectly via contact with contaminated surfaces when hands then touch the face. Respiratory droplets are large and cannot remain suspended in the air for long, and are usually dispersed over short distances. Viruses spread by droplet transmission include influenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, and norovirus; measles morbillivirus; and coronaviruses such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Bacterial and fungal infection agents may also be transmitted by respiratory droplets. By contrast, a limited number of diseases can be spread through airborne transmission after the respiratory droplet dries out. Ambient temperature and humidity affect the survivability of bioaerosols because as the droplet evaporates and becomes smaller, it provides less protection for the infectious agents it may contain. In general, viruses with a lipid envelope are more stable in dry air, while those without an envelope are more stable in moist air. Viruses are also generally more stable at low air temperatures.  Hazard controls  video] on Wikimedia Commons) In a healthcare setting, droplet precautions include housing a patient in an individual room, limiting their transport outside the room and using proper personal protective equipment. Droplet precautions are one of three categories of transmission-based precautions that are used in addition to standard precautions based on the type of infection a patient has; the other two are contact precautions and airborne precautions. However, aerosol-generating procedures may produce smaller droplets that travel farther, and so droplet precautions may be insufficient when such procedures are performed. In general, higher ventilation rates can be used as a hazard control to dilute and remove respiratory particles. However, if unfiltered or insufficiently filtered air is exhausted to another location, it can lead to spreading of an infection. Surgical masks can be used to prevent droplet transmission, both for infected patients and healthcare personnel. It has been noted that during the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak, use of surgical masks and N95 respirators tended to decrease infections of healthcare workers. While surgical masks create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants such as splashes and respiratory droplets, they are not designed to filter or block very small particles such as those that transmit airborne diseases because of the loose fit between the face mask and the face.  History  World-War-II-era UK public-health-education poster. German bacteriologist Carl Fl√ºgge in 1899 was the first to show that microorganisms in droplets expelled from the respiratory tract are a means of disease transmission. In the early 20th century, the term Fl√ºgge droplet was sometimes used for particles that are large enough to not completely dry out, roughly those larger than 100 Œºm. Fl√ºgge's concept of droplets as primary source and vector for respiratory transmission of diseases prevailed into the 1930s until William F. Wells differentiated between large and small droplets. He developed the Wells curve, which describes how the size of respiratory droplets influences their fate and thus their ability to transmit disease.

The 549th was primarily a highly mobile pontoon bridge construction unit, which also provided both M2 assault boats and a selection of infantry support bridging, ferries, and rafts. It was created on 14 January 1943, but was not committed troops until training began five months later at Camp Hood, Texas.

In the European Theater of Operations it was often just ahead or behind the 289th Engineer Combat Battalion during the months of March, April, and May 1945. At various points it detached a platoon to the 289th and traded an officer back and forth in April. On 1 April 1945, the detached 1st Platoon enjoyed Easter Dinner with the 289th at the Mudau Hotel in Mudau, Germany. By war's end its units were scattered throughout a fast- moving front that saw spearheads of U.S. troops spread throughout southern Germany and into borderlands of Austria and Italy. The 1st platoon went south from Augsburg to Landsberg, where it bridged the Lech River before ending up on the Chiemsee in southeast Germany just miles from Salzburg, Austria.

Retrieved 4 June 2012. The Ancestral Puebloans are believed to have developed, at least in part, from the Oshara Tradition, who developed from the Picosa culture. They lived in a range of structures that included small family pit houses, larger structures to house clans, grand pueblos, and cliff-sited dwellings for defense. The Ancestral Puebloans possessed a complex network that stretched across the Colorado Plateau linking hundreds of communities and population centers. They held a distinct knowledge of celestial sciences that found form in their architecture. The kiva, a congregational space that was used chiefly for ceremonial purposes, was an integral part of this ancient people's community structure. In contemporary times, the people and their archaeological culture were referred to as Anasazi for historical purposes. The Navajo, who were not their descendants, called them by this term, which meant \\"ancient enemies\\". Contemporary Puebloans do not want this term to be used. Archaeologists continue to debate when this distinct culture emerged. The current agreement, based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification, suggests their emergence around the 12th century BC, during the archaeologically designated Early Basketmaker II Era. Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations, researchers identified Ancestral Puebloans as the forerunners of contemporary Pueblo peoples.Hewit, \\"Puebloan Culture\\" , University of Northern Colorado Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park and Taos Pueblo. Etymology Pueblo, which means \\"village\\" in Spanish, was a term originating with the Spanish explorers who used it to refer to the people's particular style of dwelling. The Navajo people, who now reside in parts of former Pueblo territory, referred to the ancient people as , an exonym meaning \\"ancestors of our enemies\\", referring to their competition with the Pueblo peoples.

Geography Map of Ancestral Pueblo and neighboring cultures The Ancestral Puebloans were one of four major prehistoric archaeological traditions recognized in the American Southwest. This area is sometimes referred to as Oasisamerica in the region defining pre-Columbian southwestern North America. The others are the Mogollon, Hohokam, and Patayan. In relation to neighboring cultures, the Ancestral Puebloans occupied the northeast quadrant of the area.The Anasazi or \\"Ancient Pueblo\\" , from CP-LUHNA, Northern Arizona University The Ancestral Puebloan homeland centers on the Colorado Plateau, but extends from central New Mexico on the east to southern Nevada on the west. Areas of southern Nevada, Utah, and Colorado form a loose northern boundary, while the southern edge is defined by the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers in Arizona and the Rio Puerco and Rio Grande in New Mexico. Structures and other evidence of Ancestral Puebloan culture have been found extending east onto the American Great Plains, in areas near the Cimarron and Pecos Rivers and in the Galisteo Basin. Major Ancestral Puebloan sites in the Four Corners area Terrain and resources within this large region vary greatly. The plateau regions have high elevations ranging from . Extensive horizontal mesas are capped by sedimentary formations and support woodlands of junipers, pinon, and ponderosa pines, each favoring different elevations. Wind and water erosion have created steep-walled canyons, and sculpted windows and bridges out of the sandstone landscape. In areas where resistant strata (sedimentary rock layers), such as sandstone or limestone, overlie more easily eroded strata such as shale, rock overhangs formed. The Ancestral Puebloans favored building under such overhangs for shelters and defensive building sites. All areas of the Ancestral Puebloan homeland suffered from periods of drought, and wind and water erosion. Summer rains could be unreliable and often arrived as destructive thunderstorms. While the amount of winter snowfall varied greatly, the Ancestral Puebloans depended on the snow for most of their water. Snow melt allowed the germination of seeds, both wild and cultivated, in the spring. Where sandstone layers overlay shale, snow melt could accumulate and create seeps and springs, which the Ancestral Puebloans used as water sources. Snow also fed the smaller, more predictable tributaries, such as the Chinle, Animas, Jemez, and Taos Rivers. The larger rivers were less directly important to the ancient culture, as smaller streams were more easily diverted or controlled for irrigation. Cultural characteristics Pueblo Bonito, the largest of the Chacoan Great Houses, stands at the foot of Chaco Canyon's northern rim. The Ancestral Puebloan culture is perhaps best known for the stone and earth dwellings its people built along cliff walls, particularly during the Pueblo II and Pueblo III eras, from about 900 to 1350 AD in total. The best-preserved examples of the stone dwellings are now protected within United States' national parks, such as Navajo National Monument, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Aztec Ruins National Monument, Bandelier National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, and Canyon de Chelly National Monument. These villages, called pueblos by Spanish colonists, were accessible only by rope or through rock climbing. These astonishing building achievements had modest beginnings. The first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pit-house, a common feature in the Basketmaker periods. Ancestral Puebloans are also known for their pottery. In general, pottery used for cooking or storage in the region was unpainted gray, either smooth or textured. Pottery used for more formal purposes was often more richly adorned. In the northern or \\"Anasazi\\" portion of the Ancestral Pueblo world, from about 500 to 1300 AD, the most common decorated pottery had black-painted designs on white or light gray backgrounds. Decoration is characterized by fine hatching, and contrasting colors are produced by the use of mineral-based paint on a chalky background.Cordell, pp. 98 South of the Anasazi territory, in Mogollon settlements, pottery was more often hand-coiled, scraped, and polished, with red to brown coloring. Some tall cylinders are considered ceremonial vessels, while narrow-necked jars may have been used for liquids. Ware in the southern portion of the region, particularly after 1150 AD, is characterized by heavier black-line decoration and the use of carbon-based colorants. In northern New Mexico, the local \\"black on white\\" tradition, the Rio Grande white wares, continued well after 1300 AD. Changes in pottery composition, structure, and decoration are signals of social change in the archaeological record. This is particularly true as the peoples of the American Southwest began to leave their traditional homes and migrate south. According to archaeologists Patricia Crown and Steadman Upham, the appearance of the bright colors on Salada Polychromes in the 14th century may reflect religious or political alliances on a regional level. Late 14th- and 15th-century pottery from central Arizona, widely traded in the region, has colors and designs which may derive from earlier ware by both Ancestral Pueblo and Mogollon peoples.Cordell, p. 142-143 The Ancestral Puebloans also created many petroglyphs and pictographs. The pictograph style with which they are associated is the called the Barrier Canyon Style. This form of pictograph is painted in areas in which the images would be protected from the sun yet visible to a group of people. The figures are sometimes phantom or alien looking. The Holy Ghost panel in the Horseshoe Canyon is considered to be one of the earliest uses of graphical perspective where the largest figure appears to take on a three dimensional representation. Recent archaeological evidence has established that in at least one great house, Pueblo Bonito, the elite family whose burials associate them with the site practiced matrilineal succession. Room 33 in Pueblo Bonito, the richest burial ever excavated in the Southwest, served as a crypt for one powerful lineage, traced through the female line, for approximately 330 years. While other Ancestral Pueblo burials have not yet been subjected to the same archaeogenomic testing, the survival of matrilineal descent among contemporary Puebloans suggests that this may have been a widespread practice among Ancestral Puebloans. Architecture ‚Äì Pueblo complexes and Great Houses The Ancestral Pueblo people crafted a unique architecture with planned community spaces. The ancient population centers such as Chaco Canyon (outside Crownpoint, New Mexico), Mesa Verde (near Cortez, Colorado), and Bandelier National Monument (near Los Alamos, New Mexico) have brought renown to the Ancestral Pueblo peoples. They consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local material, or were carved into the sides of canyon walls. Developed within these cultures, the people also adopted design details from other cultures as far away as contemporary Mexico. In their day, these ancient towns and cities were usually multistoried and multipurposed buildings surrounding open plazas and viewsheds. They were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Pueblo peoples. These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadways. Multistory dwellings at Bandelier: Rock wall foundations and beam holes and \\"cavates\\" carved into volcanic tuff remain from upper floors. Constructed well before 1492 AD, these Ancestral Pueblo towns and villages in the North American Southwest were located in various defensive positions, for example, on high, steep mesas such as at Mesa Verde or present-day Acoma Pueblo, called the \\"Sky City\\", in New Mexico. Earlier than 900 AD and progressing past the 13th century, the population complexes were a major center of culture for the Ancestral Puebloans. In Chaco Canyon, Chacoan developers quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling 15 major complexes. These ranked as the largest buildings in North America until the late 19th century. Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed, with the Sun Dagger petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction. Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a 50-year drought that started in 1130. Great Houses Mancos Pitcher with Black on White Geometric Designs, Ancestral Pueblo, 900‚Äì1300 AD, Brooklyn Museum Immense complexes known as \\"great houses\\" embodied worship at Chaco. Archaeologists have found musical instruments, jewelry, ceramics, and ceremonial items, indicating people in Great Houses were elite, wealthier families. They hosted indoor burials, where gifts were interred with the dead, often including bowls of food and turquoise beads. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms. Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Ancestral Pueblo works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. Casa Rinconada, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico Doorways, Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico Houses generally faced the south. Plaza areas were almost always surrounded by edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo's rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas. Ceremonial structures known as kivas were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small kiva was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized Great Kiva, each up to in diameter. T-shaped doorways and stone lintels marked all Chacoan kivas. Though simple and compound walls were often used, great houses were primarily constructed of core-and-veneer walls: two parallel load- bearing walls comprising dressed, flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with rubble, forming the wall's core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding mud. These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauled‚Äîon foot‚Äîfrom mountain ranges up to away.Kantner, John (2004). \\"Ancient Puebloan Southwest\\", pp. 161‚Äì66 Ceremonial infrastructure One of the most notable aspects of Ancestral Puebloan infrastructure is at Chaco Canyon and is the Chaco Road, a system of roads radiating out from many great house sites such as Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl, and Una Vida. They led toward small outlier sites and natural features within and beyond the canyon limits. Through satellite images and ground investigations, archaeologists have detected at least eight main roads that together run for more than 180 miles (300 km), and are more than 30 feet (10 m) wide. These were excavated into a smooth, leveled surface in the bedrock or created through the removal of vegetation and soil. The Ancestral Pueblo residents of Chaco Canyon cut large ramps and stairways into the cliff rock to connect the roadways on the ridgetops of the canyon to the sites on the valley bottoms. The largest roads, constructed at the same time as many of the great house sites (between 1000 and 1125 AD), are: the Great North Road, the South Road, the Coyote Canyon Road, the Chacra Face Road, Ahshislepah Road, Mexican Springs Road, the West Road, and the shorter Pintado-Chaco Road. Simple structures like berms and walls are found sometimes aligned along the courses of the roads. Also, some tracts of the roads lead to natural features such as springs, lakes, mountain tops, and pinnacles.\\"Chacoan Roads.\\" National Park Service. Retrieved 4 June 2012. Great North Road The longest and most well-known of these roads is the Great North Road, which originates from different routes close to Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. These roads converge at Pueblo Alto and from there lead north beyond the canyon limits. No communities are along the road's course, apart from small, isolated structures. Archaeological interpretations of the Chaco road system are divided between an economic purpose and a symbolic, ideological role linked to ancestral Puebloan beliefs. The system was first discovered at the end of the 19th century. It was not excavated and studied until the 1970s. By the late 20th century, archeologists' assessments were helped by satellite images and photographs taken from plane flights over the area. Archaeologists suggested that the road's main purpose was to transport local and exotic goods to and from the canyon. The economic purpose of the Chaco road system is shown by the presence of luxury items at Pueblo Bonito and elsewhere in the canyon. Items such as macaws, turquoise, marine shells, which are not part of this environment, in addition to imported vessels distinguished by design, prove that the Chaco had long-distance commercial relations with other distant regions. The widespread use of timber in Chacoan constructions was based on a large and easy transportation system, as this resource is not locally available. Through analysis of various strontium isotopes, archaeologists have realized that much of the timber that composes Chacoan construction came from a number of distant mountain ranges, a finding that also supported the economic significance of the Chaco Road. Prehistoric roads and great houses in the San Juan Basin Cliff Palace communities and design laser scan data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership Laser scan section of the four-story Square Tower House, data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership Section view of Kiva A in Mesa Verde's Fire Temple, cut from laser scan data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership. Since Fire Temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of its cliff alcove, it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures defined as kivas. Throughout the southwest Ancestral Puebloan region, and at Mesa Verde, the best-known site for the large number of well- preserved cliff dwellings, housing, defensive, and storage complexes were built in shallow caves and under rock overhangs along canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities, but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend during the 13th century toward the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters. Common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses are included in this area, but the space constrictions of these alcoves resulted in a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas, built right up against each other and sharing many of their walls. Builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could and no areas were considered off-limits to construction. Not all of the people in the region lived in cliff dwellings; many colonized the canyon rims and slopes in multifamily structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. Decorative motifs for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both cliff dwellings and not, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, such as Stephen Lekson (1999), as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chaco Canyon elite system, which had seemingly collapsed around a century before.Lekson, Stephen (1999). The Chaco Meridian: centers of Political Power in the Ancient Southwest. Walnut Creek, California: Altamira Press Other researchers see these motifs as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, \\"The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis\\", paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia. History Origins During the period from 700‚Äì1130 AD (Pueblo I and II Eras), a rapid increase in population was due to consistent and regular rainfall patterns supporting agriculture. Studies of skeletal remains show that this growth was due to increased fertility rather than decreased mortality. However, this tenfold increase in population over the course of a few generations could not be achieved by increased birthrate alone; likely, it also involved migrations of peoples from surrounding areas. Innovations such as pottery, food storage, and agriculture enabled this rapid growth. Over several decades, the Ancestral Puebloan culture spread across the landscape. Ancestral Puebloan culture has been divided into three main areas or branches, based on geographical location: * Chaco Canyon (northwest New Mexico) * Kayenta (northeast Arizona), and * Northern San Juan (Mesa Verde and Hovenweep National Monument) (southwest Colorado and southeastern Utah) Modern Pueblo oral traditions hold that the Ancestral Puebloans originated from sipapu, where they emerged from the underworld. For unknown ages, they were led by chiefs and guided by spirits as they completed vast migrations throughout the continent of North America. They settled first in the Ancestral Puebloan areas for a few hundred years before moving to their present locations. Migration from the homeland Chaco Culture bowl, 11th to 13th centuries, Pueblo Alto, Chaco Canyon Why the Ancestral Puebloans left their established homes in the 12th and 13th centuries is not clear. Factors examined and discussed include global or regional climate change, prolonged periods of drought, cyclical periods of topsoil erosion, environmental degradation, deforestation, hostility from new arrivals, religious or cultural change, and influence from Mesoamerican cultures. Many of these possibilities are supported by archaeological evidence. Current scholarly opinion holds that the Ancestral Puebloans responded to pressure from Numic-speaking peoples moving onto the Colorado Plateau, as well as climate change that resulted in agricultural failures. The archaeological record indicates that for Ancestral Puebloans to adapt to climatic change by changing residences and locations was not unusual.The first to surmise this was John W. Powell, Canyons of the Colorado, 1895, Flood & Vincent. Early Pueblo I Era sites may have housed up to 600 individuals in a few separate but closely spaced settlement clusters. However, they were generally occupied for 30 years or less. Archaeologist Timothy A. Kohler excavated large Pueblo I sites near Dolores, Colorado, and discovered that they were established during periods of above-average rainfall. This allowed crops to be grown without requiring irrigation. At the same time, nearby areas that suffered significantly drier patterns were abandoned. Ancestral Puebloans attained a cultural \\"Golden Age\\" between about 900 and 1150. During this time, generally classed as Pueblo II Era, the climate was relatively warm and rainfall mostly adequate. Communities grew larger and were inhabited for longer periods of time. Highly specific local traditions in architecture and pottery emerged, and trade over long distances appears to have been common. Domesticated turkeys appeared. After around 1130, North America had significant climatic change in the form of a 300-year drought called the Great Drought. This also led to the collapse of the Tiwanaku civilization around Lake Titicaca in present-day Bolivia. The contemporary Mississippian culture also collapsed during this period. Confirming evidence dated between 1150 and 1350 has been found in excavations of the western regions of the Mississippi Valley, which show long-lasting patterns of warmer, wetter winters and cooler, drier summers. Ancestral Puebloan ruins in Dark Canyon Wilderness, Utah In this later period, the Pueblo II became more self-contained, decreasing trade and interaction with more distant communities. Southwest farmers developed irrigation techniques appropriate to seasonal rainfall, including soil and water control features such as check dams and terraces. The population of the region continued to be mobile, abandoning settlements and fields under adverse conditions. Along with the change in precipitation patterns, the drop in water table levels was due to a different cycle unrelated to rainfall. This forced the abandonment of settlements in the more arid or overfarmed locations. Evidence suggests a profound change in religion in this period. Chacoan and other structures constructed originally along astronomical alignments, and thought to have served important ceremonial purposes to the culture, were systematically dismantled. Doorways were sealed with rock and mortar. Kiva walls show marks from great fires set within them, which probably required removal of the massive roof ‚Äì a task which would require significant effort. Habitations were abandoned, and tribes were split and divided and resettled far elsewhere. This evidence suggests that the religious structures were deliberately abandoned slowly over time. Puebloan tradition holds that the ancestors had achieved great spiritual power and control over natural forces. They used their power in ways that caused nature to change, and caused changes that were never meant to occur. Possibly, the dismantling of their religious structures was an effort to symbolically undo the changes they believed they caused due to their abuse of their spiritual power, and thus make amends with nature. Most modern Pueblo peoples (whether Keresans, Hopi, or Tanoans) assert the Ancestral Puebloans did not \\"vanish\\", as is commonly portrayed in media presentations or popular books. They say that the people migrated to areas in the southwest with more favorable rainfall and dependable streams. They merged into the various Pueblo peoples whose descendants still live in Arizona and New Mexico. This perspective was also presented by early 20th-century anthropologists, including Frank Hamilton Cushing, J. Walter Fewkes, and Alfred V. Kidder. Many modern Pueblo tribes trace their lineage from specific settlements. For example, the San Ildefonso Pueblo people believe that their ancestors lived in both the Mesa Verde and the Bandelier areas. Evidence also suggests that a profound change took place in the Ancestral Pueblo area and areas inhabited by their cultural neighbors, the Mogollon. The contemporary historian James W. Loewen agrees with this oral traditions in his book, Lies Across America: What Our Historic Markers and Monuments Get Wrong (1999). No academic consensus exists with the professional archeological and anthropological community on this issue. Warfare Pecos Glazeware bowl, Pecos National Historical Park Environmental stress may have been reflected by changes in the social structure, leading to conflict and warfare. Near Kayenta, Arizona, Jonathan Haas of the Field Museum in Chicago has been studying a group of Ancestral Puebloan villages that relocated from the canyons to the high mesa tops during the late 13th century. Haas believes that the reason to move so far from water and arable land was a defense against enemies. He asserts that isolated communities relied on raiding for food and supplies, and that internal conflict and warfare became common in the 13th century. This conflict may have been aggravated by the influx of less settled peoples, Numic-speakers such as the Utes, Shoshones, and Paiute people, who may have originated in what is today California, and the arrival of the Athabaskan-speaking Din√© who migrated down from the north during this time and subsequently became the modern Navajo and Apache tribes most notably. Others suggest that more developed villages, such as that at Chaco Canyon, exhausted their environments, resulting in widespread deforestation and eventually the fall of their civilization through warfare over depleted resources. A 1997 excavation at Cowboy Wash near Dolores, Colorado found remains of at least 24 human skeletons that showed evidence of violence and dismemberment, with strong indications of cannibalism. This modest community appears to have been abandoned during the same time period.LeBlanc p.174 Other excavations within the Ancestral Puebloan cultural area have produced varying numbers of unburied, and in some cases dismembered, bodies.Tim White, Prehistoric Cannibalism at Mancos 5MTUMR-2346, Princeton, 1992, In a 2010 paper, Potter and Chuipka argued that evidence at Sacred Ridge site, near Durango, Colorado, is best interpreted as warfare related to competition and ethnic cleansing. This evidence of warfare, conflict, and cannibalism is hotly debated by some scholars and interest groups. Suggested alternatives include: a community suffering the pressure of starvation or extreme social stress, dismemberment and cannibalism as religious ritual or in response to religious conflict, the influx of outsiders seeking to drive out a settled agricultural community via calculated atrocity, or an invasion of a settled region by nomadic raiders who practiced cannibalism. Such peoples have existed in other times and places, e.g. the Androphagi of Russia according to Herodotus. Anasazi as a cultural label The term \\"Anasazi\\" was established in archaeological terminology through the Pecos Classification system in 1927. It had been adopted from the Navajo. Archaeologist Linda Cordell discussed the word's etymology and use: Many contemporary Pueblo peoples object to the use of the term Anasazi; controversy exists among them on a native alternative. Some modern descendants of this culture often choose to use the term \\"Ancestral Pueblo\\" peoples. Contemporary Hopi use the word Hisatsinom in preference to Anasazi.Pueblo culture , scroll down Cultural distinctions Boy in doorway, Balcony House, Mesa Verde National Park Archaeological cultural units such as Ancestral Puebloan, Hohokam, Patayan, or Mogollon are used by archaeologists to define material culture similarities and differences that may identify prehistoric sociocultural units, equivalent to modern societies or peoples. The names and divisions are classification devices based on theoretical perspectives, analytical methods, and data available at the time of analysis and publication. They are subject to change, not only on the basis of new information and discoveries, but also as attitudes and perspectives change within the scientific community. It should not be assumed that an archaeological division or culture unit corresponds to a particular language group or to a socio-political entity such as a tribe. Current terms and conventions have significant limitations: * Archaeological research focuses on items left behind during people‚Äôs activities: fragments of pottery vessels, garbage, human remains, stone tools or evidence left from the construction of dwellings. However, many other aspects of the culture of prehistoric peoples are not tangible. Their beliefs and behavior are difficult to decipher from physical materials, and their languages remain unknown as they had no known writing system. * Cultural divisions are tools of the modern scientist, and so should not be considered similar to divisions or relationships which the ancient residents may have recognized. Modern cultures in this region, many of whom claim some of these ancient people as ancestors, express a striking range of diversity in lifestyles, social organization, language and religious beliefs. This suggests the ancient people were also more diverse than their material remains may suggest. * The modern term \\"style\\" has a bearing on how material items such as pottery or architecture can be interpreted. Within a people, different means to accomplish the same goal can be adopted by subsets of the larger group. For example, in modern Western cultures, there are alternative styles of clothing that characterize older and younger generations. Some cultural differences may be based on linear traditions, on teaching from one generation or \\"school\\" to another. Other varieties in style may have distinguished between arbitrary groups within a culture, perhaps defining status, gender, clan or guild affiliation, religious belief or cultural alliances. Variations may also simply reflect the different resources available in a given time or area. Defining cultural groups, such as the Ancestral Puebloans, tends to create an image of territories separated by clear-cut boundaries, like border boundaries separating modern states. These did not exist. Prehistoric people traded, worshipped, collaborated, and fought most often with other nearby groups. Cultural differences should therefore be understood as \\"clinal\\", \\"increasing gradually as the distance separating groups also increases\\".Plog, p. 72. Departures from the expected pattern may occur because of unidentified social or political situations or because of geographic barriers. In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers, and most obviously, the Grand Canyon, can be significant barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups. Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloans, and their greater differences from the Hohokam and Patayan, is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.

The hippodrome was a wide, flat, open space where the starting point and the finish line were designated with a pole and a second smaller pole called nyssa designated the turning point. Horse and chariot races were one of the most popular and spectacular sports of the Olympic Games in ancient Greece. The equestrian sports of the time were the tethrippon, the apene, the synoris, the tethrippon for foals, the synoris for foals, the perfect keles race, the kalpe and the pole horse race. According to mythology, the first chariot race took place in Olympia between King Pelops and King Oenomaus of Pisa. In the ancient Olympic Games the jockeys were not the owners of the horses. The owners of the horses were declared winners, they were awarded the wreath and enjoyed all the honors although they did not take part in the race. The jockeys won only a small portion from the glory of the winner, such as a wool band that the owner would tie on their head. The hippodrome of ancient Olympia had a complex starting mechanism in order to avoid false starts. The starting mechanism was designed by the statue maker Kleoitas and was later improved by Aristidis. According to Pausanias, the required energy for the movement of the mechanism came from the drop of a bronze dolphin and the rise of a bronze eagle. Today, the hippodrome does not exist. Some claim that it was washed away by the river Alfeios while others claim that its location is to the southeast of the Stadium.

After the Liberation, the center was moved to Paris in 1944 where it remains today. The goal of the CDJC is to conduct research, publish documentation, pursue Nazi war criminals, seek restitution for victims of the Nazis, and to maintain a large archive of Holocaust materials, especially those concerning events affecting French Jewry. Part of the efforts of the CDJC include providing educational materials to students and teachers, guided museum visits and field trips, participation in international conferences, activities and commemorations, maintaining monuments and sites like the M√©morial de la Shoah and the monument at Drancy, and most importantly collecting and disseminating documentation about the Holocaust in their extensive archives. Background While the Second World War was still underway, the Nazis had already formed a contingency plan that in case of defeat they would carry out the total destruction of German recordsp. xiii of the extermination of millions of victims, per Heinrich Himmler's statement to SS officials that the history of the Final Solution would be \\"a glorious page that will never be written\\". They largely succeeded in this attempt. In France, the situation with respect to preserving war records was not much better, partly as a result of French state secrecy rules dating back to well before the war aimed at protecting the French government and the state from embarrassing revelations, and partly to avoid culpability. For example, at Liberation, the Prefecture of Police destroyed nearly all of the massive archive of Jewish arrest and deportation. France's Jewish population before the war was around 300,000, of which 75,721 were deported, with only 2500 surviving. Political deportees fared better, with 37,000 returning. By the 1950s, the Jewish population was half what it was before the war, most of them from Eastern Europe. In the aftermath of the shock and trauma of the war, many Jews converted to Christianity, Frenchified their names, and the number of Jewish ceremonies performed (including circumcision which could identify males as Jewish) dropped precipitously. Many just wanted to forget, and disappear into French society; for most, gathering a history of the Holocaust was not a priority. It was in this context, that a very small number of Jews first took on the task of preserving the record of events in order that it not be lost to history. In France, this occurred first at Drancy where camp registers were carefully preserved and turned over to the new National Office for Veterans and Victims of War; which however then held them in secret refusing to release copies even to the CDJC. Founding and early efforts Already before the end of the war, Isaac Schneersohn, anticipating the need for a center to document and preserve the memory of the persecution for historical reasons and also support claims post-war, gathered 40 representatives from Jewish organizations together at his place at rue Bizanet in Grenoble which was under Italian occupation at the time in order to form a centre de documentation. as quoted in Exposure meant the death penalty, and as a result little actually happened before liberation. Serious work began after the center moved to Paris in late 1944 and was renamed the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation (Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine, CDJC). Its stated goal was to document the persecution and martyrdom of French Jewry by collecting massive amounts of documentation, to study discriminatory laws, to support attempts at recovery of confiscated Jewish property, to document the suffering as well as the heroism of the Jews, and to record the attitude of governments, administrations, and various sectors of public opinion. Early efforts received little recognition for a number of reasons. One was that these were grassroots movements to preserve the memory of the Holocaust, much of it by people who were not part of academia or trained as historians and thus looked down on by professionals. Another reason was that much of the early historiography focused on the perpetrators, with little effort aimed at documenting the experience of victims, which was relegated to the domain of \\"memory\\" rather than that of \\"history\\". In addition, early efforts consisted of collecting and publishing primary sources and survivor testimonies, and rarely on analysis and thematic interpretation of events which might have attracted more attention from academia. Finally, Schneersohn wanted CDJC to be the sole repository and outlet for historiography on the Holocaust, and when for example Poliakov published outside the CDJC in 1951, they had a falling-out. However, the early efforts in collecting, documenting, and preserving the basic information laid the groundwork for all future Holocaust historiography. The Nuremberg trials presented the opportunity for its first public appearance on the world stage. Relocation to Paris After the liberation in 1944, the CDJC moved to Paris. In 1956 it moved to the Marais, the Jewish district of Paris in the 4th arrondissement, sharing space in the building containing the memorial to the Unknown Jewish Martyr. Renovations were undertaken in 2004 to handle expansion and to be able to host conferences and have exhibition space. Publications Early publications Early publications in the 1940s had limited exposure, such as Les Juifs sous l'Occupation: Recueil de textes francais et allemands 1940-1944 and La Condition des Juifs sous l'occupation allemande 1940-44. Starting in 1951, works such as Poliakov's Br√©viaire de la haine (Harvest of Hate), the first major work on the genocide, first began to reach a wider audience and receive some good reviews in opposition to the prevailing opinion in studies at the time that a major genocide of six million Jews was logistically impossible and thus could not have happened. Most CDJC publications were not in bookstores and were not widely available. There was little public interest in the Holocaust, and financial returns were minimal. Reaction to early CJDC publications in early postwar France During the first period until 1955, most publications depended on German archives to document anti-Jewish persecution in France going back to the Dreyfus period, and served both Vichy and the Nazis. However any indication in new scholarship that attempted to pin any amount of culpability on the French ran counter to public feeling in France at the time, which was that the Germans were responsible for all persecution and that the French were either blameless victims or members of, or helping the Resistance. Vichy was considered an unpleasant aberration, and the general feeling was to avoid discussion about it so as to avoid poking old wounds. The three-volume Le commissariat General aux Question Juives by Joseph Billig published in 3 volumes in 1955-60 (vol 2, 1957, ; vol 3, 1960, ). showed that the French response to roundups of Jews when they were not actively profiting from the spoils, was apathetic at best. The book was mostly ignored due to the prevailing feeling at the time but since has been considered a seminal work. Because of these factors and the general atmosphere at the time, the CDJC operated almost in an underground manner. Poliakov said in his Memoires that even the word genocide was considered unfit for publication in 1951 when his groundbreaking work was first published. as cited in p247 of Periodicals The CDJC began publishing a periodical bulletin in 1945 which continued appearing under various names, into the 21st century. It began in April 1945 as the Bulletin du Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine (Bulletin of the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation) which printed eight issues through January 1946. These were not sold openly. It stopped publishing temporarily in September 1945, when Schneersohn applied to the French Minister of Information for permission to publish, under the new name Revue du Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine (Journal of the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation). This, in turn, officially changed its name to Le Monde Juif (Jewish World) in July 1946, and was published as a monthly, 24-page magazine with about 1500 charter subscribers. Its first issue was published on August 1946. In 1995, it was renamed as Revue d'histoire de la Shoah ‚Äì Le Monde Juif (Journal of the History of the Shoah‚ÄìJewish World) and finally ending up as the Revue d'histoire de la Shoah in 2005. The CDJC initials had disappeared from the cover and were incorporated instead as part of the new logo adopted by the M√©morial de la Shoah, Mus√©e, Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine. War crimes trials One of the core missions of the CDJC is to bring perpetrators of war crimes to justice. CDJC played a role at Nuremberg, and has participated in several high-profile and numerous other actions. The most well known cases are those of Adolf Eichmann, Klaus Barbie, and Maurice Papon. Nuremberg trials The Nuremberg trials began in November 1945. Schneerson sent L√©on Poliakov who had recently joined CJDC as a historian to Nuremberg as an expert researcher, along with an assistant, Joseph Billig. They founded Jewish World War II historiography alone with no training. Many documents in evidence at Nuremberg ended up in the Center, and became the kernel of their photo and document archives. These, in turn, were used in France in the post-war years in many war crime trials, such as those of Klaus Barbie, Maurice Papon and others. The Center was also responsible for bringing a key document to light, the original order for the 1944 roundup of Jewish refugee children of Izieu who were later deported to Auschwitz and killed upon arrival. Contrary to the opinion that there was no serious scholarship about the Holocaust before the early 1960s, the CDJC had been active going back to the 1940s and 50s, although their efforts were little noted even by historians and were almost totally unknown to the public. The Eichmann trial in 1961 changed all that, and the decision to televise it brought the trial and the history of the Holocaust into millions of homes and riveted the attention of the world. The Barbie trial in Lyon in 1987 once again brought the history of World War II onto the front pages of newspapers and public awareness, and again the proceedings were filmed, due to their exceptional historical importance. In both cases, the archives maintained by the CDJC played a role. Adolf Eichmann The trial of Adolf Eichmann for crimes against humanity began in Jerusalem on 11 April 1961. The Israeli government arranged for the trial to have prominent media coverage, and the worldwide press was there. CDJC science director Georges Wellers served as a witness in the Eichmann trial. One of the goals of the trial was to disseminate information about the Holocaust to the public, and for the great majority of people around the world watching or reading about it, the Eichmann trial was their first confrontation with anything having to do with the Holocaust. As a result of all the coverage, it sparked interest in wartime events, which ultimately resulted in an increase in coverage of the war in public school education, publication of memoirs as well as academic studies which helped promote public awareness of the Holocaust. Eichmann was sentenced to capital punishment, and the sentence was carried out on 1 April 1962. Klaus Barbie Klaus Barbie was a Gestapo member, known as the \\"Butcher of Lyon\\" for having personally sadistically tortured French prisoners including men, women, and children, in Lyon, France. He was responsible for arresting French Resistance member Jean Moulin, and for signing the deportation order for the children from the orphanage at Izieu. He was wanted for crimes committed in Lyon between 1942 and 1944. After being tracked and discovered by the Klarsfelds (Serge and Beate Klarsfeld) living in Bolivia in 1971, Barbie was eventually extradited and returned to France in 1983. He faced trial 11 May 1987 in Lyon before the Cour d'assises. As in the case of the Eichmann trial, the court recognized the great historical importance of the trial, and very exceptionally allowed it to be filmed. The CDJC was in possession of a key document relating to the deportation of the children from Izieu, and provided a copy to the French courts, which enabled the prosecution of Barbie for Crimes against Humanity. Barbie had been tried in absentia in 1952 and 1954, and French law prohibits double jeopardy. But the charges did not include events at Izieu, and so it was this charge, backed by the evidence provided by the telegram supplied by the CDJC, which enabled his prosecution and conviction. Faure had actually read the Barbie telegram in his summation to the jury at Nuremberg but without naming him as he was not on trial there, but merely as a way of describing the routine, administrative nature of the killing that was carried out by the Nazis. It wasn't until the Barbie trial, that his name was linked to the telegram.Lives in the Law, http://www.press.umich.edu/175524 Austin Sarat, Lawrence Douglas, and Martha Umphrey, editors, U. Michigan Press, , p215-232 France and Trials for Crimes Against Humanity by Annette Wieviorka Barbie was sentenced to a life term, and died of natural causes in prison in 1991. 1970s and 80s Until the 1970s, almost all Holocaust studies emanating from France came from the CDJC and its historians, and no serious works appeared from French universities or other historical scholarship from within France. When serious studies finally did come out in the 1970s and 1980s outside the CDJC, they came from abroad, including the United States, Canada, and Germany, such as Robert Paxton's seminal Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944 which hit France like a hurricane and sparked the \\"Paxtonian revolution\\", as it was known in France, in Vichy historiography. Attacked vehemently at first by French historians and others, he ended up being awarded the Legion of Honor in 2009. CDJC and Yad Vashem Before 1982, only one conference was held in France on the subject of the Holocaust, and it was one organized in 1947 by the CDJC. Schneersohn wanted to make Paris the primary world center for the memory of the genocide, but Zionists had other ideas and ultimately Schneersohn agreed in 1953 to a division of responsibilities with the Yad Vashem memorial center in Israel with the latter holding most of the responsibilities. Memorials and monuments Part of the CDJC's mission is to establish and maintain monuments or memorials to promote the remembrance of the Holocaust. Memorial of the Unknown Jewish Martyr A tradition of honoring the unknown soldier existed in France since the post-World War I era. As a way of combatting forgetfulness of the genocide, Schneersohn added a Memorial Tomb to the CDJC Center which was inaugurated in October 1956. The Memorial of the Unknown Jewish martyr (M√©morial du martyr juif inconnu) was dedicated at the CDJC and became the central memorial and symbol of Jewish memory in France, serving as the venue for Holocaust commemorations. In 2005, the CDJC and the Memorial of the Unknown Jewish Martyr merged, and was renamed the M√©morial de la Shoah; the new entity opened its doors on January 27, 2005. Memorial at Drancy During the Occupation 90% of Jews and others deported to the concentration camps passed through the Drancy internment camp. From 1942 to 1944, about 63,000 Jews were interned here and sent east. Land for a memorial at Drancy was donated by Drancy City Hall, and funded by the Foundation for the Memory of the Shoah. The memorial was billed as an adjunct to the one in Paris, and a way to introduce the public to the former internment camp there‚Äîa place of history, and of remembrance. The Shoah Memorial was inaugurated September 21, 2012 at Drancy by Fran√ßois Hollande, President of the Republic. Holdings and selected works The Center has a large library and has published many documents, including some from the French Gestapo, the German Embassy in Paris, the German Supreme Military Command in France, and the French (CGQJ). The original holdings stemmed from a huge collection of documents and photos received from the Allies after Nuremberg. A selection of some individual documents and publications of historical interest include: * Breviaire de la Haine, by L. Poliakov; 1951 * Commissariat G√©n√©ral aux Questions Juives (1955‚Äì57) by J.

The dog \\"Kostya\\" In 1995, residents of a Tolyatti began noticing a German Shepherd dog at the edge of South Highway, a bypass road in the Auto Factory District of the town which leads to the AvtoVAZ car factory. He was always in the same place, and he rushed at passing cars. Word of the dog spread around the city and the people of the city informally adopted him. Further research showed that in the summer of 1995 the dog had been riding in a car with a man and a girl. The car had crashed, the girl was killed on the spot, and the man was taken to a hospital where he died a few hours later; the dog survived. His name was not known, so people began calling him \\"Faithful\\" or \\"Kostya\\" (a hypocorism (affectionate diminutive) of Constantine which itself devolves from \\"constant, steadfast\\"). People built doghouses for him and some tried to adopt him into their homes, but no such attempt succeeded: the dog always came back, looking for his master, nor would he stay in the shelters; all he would take from the people was food. In the snow and rain, in any weather and time of year, he was always in his spot. The dog always waited and ran up to all passing vehicles. Everyone who traveled that road from the old city to the new always saw Kostya running along the roadside or resting quietly on the grass. The citizens became very fond of Kostya and turned his story into a living legend. Stories about the dog were published throughout Russia. For seven years Kostya kept his post, but in 2002, he was found dead in the woods. A rumor spread that he had been hit by a truck driver who, fearing the wrath of the people, hid his body in the woods to conceal the evidence, thereby walking away from responsibility. However, there were no signs of injury to his body. The monument Kostya looks east across Lev Yashin Street and down South Highway The loss of the popular dog was sad news for many residents. In his memory a homemade billboard was erected with the legend \\"Dog, teach us love and devotion\\", but it was often blown away by the wind and hooligans threw stones at it, so the city of Tolyatti initiated a campaign to construct a bronze statue of Kostya. The sculpture was made by Ulyanovsk sculptor Oleg Klyuyev, son of sculptors Anatoly Klyuyev and Lyubov Turskaya. The bronze sculpture, about tall and set on a granite pedestal of about the same height, cost about 250,000 rubles It stands in District 21 at the intersection of South Highway and Lev Yashin Street. Klyuyev made the sculpture so that it seems to drivers that he is turning his head for each passing car, hoping to see once more his dead master. The memorial was dedicated on June 1, 2003, the 266th anniversary of the founding of Tolyatti, which is celebrated on the first Sunday of summer. The dedication was attended by about 100 to 150 people, half being members of the Tolyatti Rotary Club which had financed the monument and the others being journalists and private citizens. Mayor Nikolai Utkin spoke at the dedication, as did deputy mayor and Rotary Club president Nikolai Renz, who said: After the official unveiling, Mayor Utkin, mindful of the fate of The Little Mermaid, put the memorial under guard until such time as an alarm system could be installed. Head of the statue shows the nose polished by many hands The monument was the first in Tolyalli not erected for political reasons. Today, the memorial is a popular visiting place for newlyweds, as a symbol of unbreakable fidelity. By tradition, the young couple, to demonstrate and ensure their commitment to each other and to a happy family life, rub the nose of the statue, so that the dog's nose has become polished by many hands. In popular culture The song \\"Watchdog\\" by Cat Sasha (the stage name of the Moscow singer-songwriter and rock poet Aleksandra Pavlova) on her 2013 album Intercity Traveler is about Kostya the dog.

Biography Pearsons was born in Bradford, Vermont. He graduated in medicine at Woodstock, and practiced in Chicopee, Massachusetts until 1857. He became a farmer in Ogle County, Illinois in 1857. In 1860, he moved to Chicago, where he rapidly accumulated a large fortune in real estate. For some years, he served the city as alderman, and assisted in managing its financial budgets. He was best known through his large gifts to educational eleemosynary institutions, the Presbyterian Hospital of Chicago and Chicago Theological Seminary (Congregational) being especially favoured. There are few of the smaller colleges to which he did not give from $25,000 to $250,000, and his gifts ran well up into the millions. Pearsons was a vegetarian.Dr. D. K.

Established in 1934, the hospital remained in service for 52 years, until 1986 when it was closed down. Nowadays the buildings of the former hospital have multiple functions, for example harbouring several schools, kindergartens and a health centre.  History   Establishment  253x253px The Swedish Riksdag had in 1929 agreed to the construction of Umedalens hospital, which later came to be Umedalens sjukhus. It was built 1934 according to the blueprint of Carl Westman, who regarded an area near Backen in western Ume√• as a suitable place, as the surrounding forests provided a natural barrier against the nearby community. The complex consisted of 22 buildings, which architectural design were inspired by classicism and romantic nationalism, and were marked with the letters M or K, followed by a number. Buildings marked with M denoted those containing males (Swedish: m√§n ‚Äì ‚Äúmen‚Äù), while buildings with K housed females (kvinnor ‚Äì ‚Äúwomen‚Äù). Additionally, several culverts were built to connect the buildings, which made it more convenient to transport patients and medicines between them.  1934‚Äì1986  At the most, the hospital housed some 1000 patients, with 800 of those being brought from other hospitals in Norrland. The hospital complex was for the most part self-sufficient, with its own wickerwork, shoemaker, library and gardener. During the 1980s, a debate concerning the contemporary treatment of mental disorders flared up in Sweden and a swift change in public opinion contributed to the hospital‚Äôs eventual shutdown in 1986.  Treatment  Methods of treating patients included deliberate hypoglycaemia, electric shocks and lobotomy. Other treatments were to sedate patients during large portions of the day, to bathe them in frigid or very hot water and also pyrotherapy ‚Äì causing high fever through exposure to certain bacteria, sometimes leading to unconsciousness.  Lobotomy  Old documents from the hospital show that the hospital lobotomised approximately 770 individuals, which is more than any other in the world. Lobotomy wasn‚Äôt performed solely on the mentally ill, but on people suffering from dementia, epilepsy and even deaf-mutes and visually impaired are found among those lobotomised. Others were simply considered as feebleminded and/or imbecile (Swedish: sinnessl√∂a). 63 percent of the lobotomised patients were female, and journals also show that lobotomy was performed on adolescents and mentally retarded. Although being described as lucrative, the mortality of lobotomy is calculated to have been around 7.4 percent. The youngest known patient that underwent lobotomy was a 17-year-old girl, diagnosed with schizophrenia. Old lobotomy journals claim that the girl was ‚Äúseduced‚Äù at the age of 14, and in 1946 she was admitted to the hospital. After being treated with electric shocks and insulin therapy, the girl was eventually lobotomised ‚Äì with the results regarded as successful.  Present  Since its closing, the premises of Umedalens sjukhus have come to serve multiple purposes. However, most of the buildings today harbour primary schools, such as a Montessori school, V√§stang√•rds skola (public) and Hannaskolan (Christian charter school). The former hospital library now functions as both a public library and a school library. Some psychiatric care still transpires in the area, such as BUP, that offers child and adolescent psychiatry. Even today, the buildings are distinguished by their architectural design, with the notable red colour and marking. Umedalen is nowadays primarily a residential area, and suburbs have emerged around the old premises of Umedalens Sjukhus. Some buildings in the vicinity have been designed accordingly to the past mental hospital.

Barbecue restaurants may open relatively early compared to other restaurants, in part to optimize sales while barbecued foods being slow-cooked by the process of smoking are being tended to by restaurant personnel on premises. In some instances, this can enable the sales of barbecued meats that began being smoked the night before the next business day. Per these logistics, a significant portion of their sales may occur during lunchtime. Additionally, high lunch turnover at barbecue restaurants may occur per the foods being cooked and sold in large batches. Popular food items may sell out earlier compared to others, which may encourage customers to arrive earlier. In January 2015, the U.S. National Restaurant Association forecast \\"barbecue, Italian food and fried chicken\\" to be \\"top perennial menu favorites in 2015\\". Etymology United States In northern and midwestern areas of the United States, a barbecue restaurant may be referred to as a \\"barbecue joint\\". In southern areas of the U.S., a barbecue restaurant may be referred to as a \\"barbecue\\" or \\"barbecue place\\", rather than as a barbecue restaurant. Some barbecue restaurants may be referred to as \\"shrines\\" or as a \\"barbecue shrine\\", which can refer to those that have earned a strong reputation for purveying high-quality food over the course of several years, and even over the course of generations. Portugal and Brazil Brazilian churrasco A churrascaria is a place where meat is cooked in churrasco style, which translates roughly from the Portuguese for 'barbecue'. A churrasqueiro is somebody who cooks churrasco style food in a churrascaria restaurant. Some churrascarias offer all-you-can-eat dining in a style that is referred to as rod√≠zio. They may offer many types of barbecued meats. In Brazil, a churrascart is a food cart that serves churrasco, and they are common in the country. Operations England Some barbecue restaurants in London, England include London's Pitt Cue Co. and Barbecoa, the latter of which is owned by Jamie Oliver. Mexico In Central Mexico, barbecue outlets are common and numerous in midsize to large size cities, and often exist at roadside stalls in outlying areas of the metropolitan area. These outlets may not qualify as being restaurants per se, although they often offer the same types of foods. These outlets may offer barbacoa-style foods. In this region, when quantities of meats are depleted, the restaurant or outlet typically closes. Philippines Mongolian barbecue restaurants are popular in the Philippines. In 1991 it was suggested that this may be due in part to the economic recession that was occurring in the early 1990s, because many Mongolian barbecue restaurants operate as affordable buffets that enable diners to eat as much as they desire. South Korea Korean barbecue at a restaurant in South Korea Barbecue restaurants in South Korea are referred to as gogi-jip (English: \\"meat house\\"). They are very common and popular in Seoul. Daedo Sikdang and Nongoljip are Korean barbecue restaurant franchises that both originated in Seoul. United States Meats being cooked at a barbecue restaurant in Chicago, Illinois Barbecue restaurants may have one or more pitmasters that oversee the preparation and cooking of foods, along with maintaining fire and food temperatures. The word \\"pitmaster\\" is derived from \\"the ability to control the fires of the pit\\". The sizes of barbecue restaurants can vary, ranging from very large to smaller-sized buildings, and some exist as mobile food trucks and food booths. In the U.S., some restaurant chains exist, such as Sonny's Real Pit BBQ, which is a franchise that in 2010 was the largest barbecue restaurant chain in the U.S. with over 130 stores, Smokey Bones, with over 70 stores in 2010, and Rib Crib, with 41 stores in 2008. Dickey's Barbecue Pit is the largest barbecue franchise in the United States. Cuisine In the United States, barbecue restaurants may offer dishes that are slow-smoked or barbecued over a grill. Fare includes barbecue sandwiches, brisket, barbecue chicken, pulled pork, pork shoulder, pork ribs, beef ribs, beefsteak and other foods. Various side dishes are typically available, such as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and corn on the cob, among others. A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, and may not offer any as condiments. This may occur per a preference for the flavor of the meats to stand on their own, rather than being accentuated with flavors from sauces. Some barbecue restaurants use a dry spice rub to flavor meats.

It is one of his later works, and is considered to be an outstanding piece. Other titles are Spain succoring Religion or Religion assisted by Spain. It was sent to Philip II of Spain in 1576, remained in the Spanish Royal Collection subsequently, and had been in the Prado Museum since the 19th century. Painting Spain rescues Religion is an allegory mixed with political propaganda, portraying Spain as a woman in a dramatic landscape, with a shield in her right hand and a spear with the flag of Victory on it in her left hand. Moreover, both her left and right hand fingers make a symbolic V (\\"victory\\") gesture. The shield bears the coat of arms of Philip II, King of Spain from 1556 to 1598. Behind her is a woman carrying a sword, representing Justice. The Turkish threat is shown by a man, perhaps Poseidon, wearing a turban in a chariot with two horses on the sea. The person symbolizing the Christian religion is depicted as a woman, to the right, falling on her knees, covered with a blue drapery, threatened not only by the Turks but also by Protestantism, represented by snakes. At the far left behind Justice is the head of man, perhaps Philip's half-brother Juan of Austria, commander of the Christian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto. History In the Battle of Lepanto the troops of the Holy League defeated the Ottoman navy of Selim II (1524‚Äì1574). This Holy League was formed by an alliance of Spain, Venice and the Papal States. The battle halted the expansion of the Ottoman Empire further in Europe. Giulio Fontana, after Titian: Religion saved by the Empire The composition echoes a painting commenced by Titian for Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara (1486‚Äì1534), and left unfinished on the Duke's death; it was seen in Titian's studio in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari, still unfinished. It depicted a male nude bowing to Minerva and another woman with a laurel branch representing Peace, with Amphitrite in a chariot in the sea. It was modified and sent to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II before November 1568, to show a figure representing the Holy Roman Empire defending an allegorical figure representing Religion. It was engraved by c.1568, but the original oil painting is now lost.Religion Rescued by the Empire, Prado  References  External links * Masterpieces Prado shows honors to civil war rescue efforts Category:1575 paintings Category:Paintings by Titian in the Museo del Prado Category:16th-century allegorical paintings category:Allegorical paintings by Italian artists Category:Horses in art Category:Snakes in art Category:Water in art Category:Battle of Lepanto ","title":"Religion saved by Spain"},{"id":"45691254","text":"Yannis Tsividis is Charles Batchelor Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University.

Her discoveries include the fact that pathogens can be transmitted between vectors feeding on a host without being detectable in the host's blood. She is also a science administrator who served as the director of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (2001‚Äì11). As of 2015, she is professor of arbovirology in the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford. Education Nuttall gained a BSc in microbiology at the University of Bristol in 1974. Her PhD in virology (1978), under the supervision of Jim Stott and C. Kaplan, was at the Institute for Animal Health (now the Pirbright Institute) and the University of Reading. Career From 1977, Nuttall did post-doctoral research at the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology of the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford and the NERC Unit of Invertebrate Virology in Oxford. She remained at the NERC unit, which was renamed the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology (IVEM), rising to be its director in 1996. In 2001, IVEM merged with other bodies to become the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, and Nuttall served as the centre's director until 2011. During this period she oversaw the major restructuring of the centre. She subsequently directed national projects with NERC. She chaired the Partnership for European Environmental Research from 2008 to 2010. Nuttall has been professor of arbovirology in the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford since 2013. She is a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. Research Electron micrograph of tick-borne encephalitis virus Her early research was on the cattle disease, bovine viral diarrhoea. Nuttall found that the bovine viral diarrhoea virus was often present as a contaminant in foetal bovine serum, a commonly used laboratory reagent, a result that was published in Nature in 1977. She then worked with ornithologist Chris Perrins trying to identify the virus responsible for puffinosis, a disease that affects the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) sea bird. During this research, Nuttall visited sea-bird colonies and became interested in ticks, arthropods that often infest sea birds as well as other vertebrates, and can act as vectors for disease. Nonsystemic transmission In the early 1980s, Nuttall started to study viruses transmitted by ticks, initially focusing on orbiviruses, nairoviruses and thogotoviruses. While performing experiments designed to explore whether Thogoto virus, an influenza-like virus, can be transmitted between ticks during mating, Nuttall and her colleagues unexpectedly found that control ticks became infected. They discovered that the virus can be transmitted between infected and uninfected ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, without the virus being present at a detectable level in the blood. With Milan Labuda, Nuttall subsequently demonstrated the same phenomenon with tick-borne encephalitis virus, a better- understood arthropod-transmitted virus. These results challenge the then- accepted idea that arthropod-transmitted viruses can only be transmitted when the arthropod vector feeds on an infected host in which the virus is replicating and circulating in the blood above a threshold level. Sarah Randolph comments: The phenomenon of nonviraemic or nonsystemic transmission turns out to be widespread ‚Äì it has been subsequently observed with many other viruses transmitted by ticks, black flies and mosquitos, including major human pathogens such as West Nile virus, as well as other pathogens, including the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. ‚Äì and important in natural transmission. Nuttall's group has continued to study the phenomenon, and have shown that immunity to tick-borne encephalitis virus does not prevent nonsystemic transmission. Tick saliva The tropical bont tick, whose saliva is the source of variegin Nuttall's recent work has focused on discovering the function of tick saliva's many constituents, as well as the mechanisms by which tick-transmitted pathogens use them to enhance their transmission. Nuttall and colleagues were the first to show, in 1989, that tick saliva promotes the transmission of viruses, a phenomenon which they have called \\"saliva-assisted transmission\\"; this has been suggested as a mechanism for nonsystemic transmission. In 1998, she and her colleagues characterised three immunoglobulin-binding proteins, which were among the first proteins from tick saliva to be sequenced. With Norbert Fuchsberger, Valeria Hajnicka and others, Nuttall has shown that tick saliva suppresses the host's antiviral immune responses, including natural killer cell activity and the induction of type I interferon and cytokines involved in inflammation. Her group has also shown that the proteins in saliva differ between individual ticks of the same species and also change over the course of feeding. Drugs and vaccines Some components of tick saliva have potential as drugs to treat a range of conditions unrelated to tick disease. Nuttall comments that \\"These molecules have been refined by millions of years of evolution. There are no toxicity problems, they work on a range of animals, they aren't fragile ‚Äî and there are an awful lot of them.\\" For example, with Guido Paesen, Nuttall has characterised histamine-binding proteins that can suppress inflammation in humans by binding directly to histamine, rather than blocking its access to cell receptors, of which at least four are known. One of these proteins, rEV131, was investigated by NERC spin-off company Evolutec for the treatment of hay fever and for use in recovery from cataract surgery. Another example is the anticoagulant variegin, discovered by Nuttall and Maria Kazimirova in the tropical bont tick (Amblyomma variegatum), which represents a novel class of thrombin inhibitor; it has been shown to prevent venous thrombosis in a zebrafish model. Tick saliva products are also possible targets for vaccines to control tick infestation and, potentially, to prevent the diseases they carry. One vaccine candidate explored by Nuttall's group is 64TRP, a 15 kDa Rhipicephalus appendiculatus protein from the cement cone that glues the tick's mouthparts to the host. Vaccination with 64TRP can protect against tick-borne encephalitis virus carried by a different type of tick, the castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus), in a mouse model. Awards Nuttall received the Ivanovsky Medal for Virology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1996. She was awarded the OBE in the 2000 New Year Honours List, for \\"services to Environmental Science and Policy.\\" Selected publications Books * Research papers  * References Category:British virologists Category:British arachnologists Category:Fellows of Wolfson College, Oxford Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:Alumni of the University of Reading Category:Natural Environment Research Council Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:1953 births Category:Living people ","title":"Pat Nuttall"},{"id":"45691299","text":"Rosalba hovorei is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The picture was largely filmed at Barker‚Äôs newly built Ealing Studios, where Barker gained a reputation for extravagant productions, often historical.Oakley p. 58 A great deal of money was invested in Sixty Years a Queen, and more than a thousand actors and extras were employed, on many locations. There was also much advance publicity. The picture was a great success at the box-offices, making the producers a profit of some ¬£35,000. More than twenty years later Herbert Wilcox made a similar film, Sixty Glorious Years, which was also very popular.

In WCBU2015 (world national beach tournament 2015) in Dubai, Currier Island sent five teams in the divisions: mixed, masters open, masters mixed, masters women and grand masters http://www.wcbu2015.org/about- wcbu-2015/participating-countries/  History  Currier Island is an ultimate frisbee team that began as a fictional island nation created by Ivan Cestero and Minh Le. In the Fall of 2004, the first World Champions Beach Ultimate (sport) was held in Figuiera de Foz, Portugal. In order to play in the tournament, players needed to be on the official roster of a country's team. The United States roster was already filled. In order to play in the tournament, Cestero and Le (who played ultimate together at Dartmouth College) along with other Dartmouth class of '01 alums (Michael Holmes, Christopher Taylor, Craig Davis, and Michael Gallagher), decided to create a fictional island nation to represent. Le wrote a letter to the head of the WCBU as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs for Currier Island, stating that the tournament would not be a true world championship if Currier Island was not invited to compete. Together, Cestero and Le convinced the tournament directors to allow Currier Island into the tournament. Shortly thereafter, the tournament directors replied to Le and Cestero inquiring as to the geographic location of Currier Island, as they were unable to find it online or on any maps. Le and Cestero admitted that the island was fictitious, but the tournament committee decided to allow Currier Island to compete as an international pick-up team. It was decided that at every WCBU tournament from then on, an international team would be allowed to play under the flag of Currier Island. The inaugural Currier Island team consisted of players from the U.S., Hungary, Austria, and South Africa. After a week-long training camp in Tarifa, Currier Island beat countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and Finland to finish 10th in the first annual World Beach Championships. The Currier Island team has continued to play in beach ultimate tournaments around the world, including Paganello in Italy, Boracay Open in the Philippines, and Wildwood in New Jersey.  limitations of eligibility  While Currier Island can compete, they can't play in the knock out stages of tournaments. That is, not being a real country.

The CPR's arrival in Edmonton The initial construction of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in 1891 was limited by the North Saskatchewan River with services reaching no further than Strathcona. This contributed to a competitive disadvantage when the Canadian Northern Railway arrived in Edmonton in 1905. The High Level Bridge was constructed to complete the railway to Edmonton proper and squash this disadvantage. When it was completed in 1913, CPR (who had acquired the C&E;) constructed a new station north of the river, on the north-west corner of Jasper Avenue and 109 Street. The two-story, classical station contained the usual amenities such as a ticketing office and waiting room, as well a special immigrants' waiting room in the basement. The station became a hub for passenger traffic and counterpoint to the CNoR (later Canadian National Railway) station located at 104 Avenue and 100 Street. Demise Following the CPR's withdrawal of passenger services to downtown Edmonton in 1972, the station building was demolished in 1978, despite an effort to save it.

Design and development According to his own account, the idea of a flying wing aircraft came to Fauvel in July 1928 during a discussion of the design of high performance gliders; the central aim was to cut down drag to near the limit set by the lift induced drag of the wing by minimising other components. The best possible aircraft should avoid everything but the wing. In 1929 experiments were made with a model of his initial design, known as the AV.1, in the wind tunnel at the aeronautical laboratory at Saint-Cyr to check lift, drag and stability. He built his first full-size aircraft in collaboration with Louis Peyret. It could be flown as a glider or powered with a engine. Peyret had no spare man-power in his factory and a deal was struck with the Soci√©t√© Makhonine. Initially it was intended that the AV.2 should be built by Guerchais at Saint Cloud but after their closure construction was taken over by Caudron and a more powerful engine fitted. The AV.2 was almost entirely wing. Constructed around a single main spar, with an auxiliary spar to carry the ailerons, it was a wooden structure with plywood skin from the main spar forward around the leading edge forming a D-box. The rest was fabric covered. There was a thick centre section, which occupied about 20% of the span but more than 33% of its area, and outer panels with marked taper and dihedral. In the absence of a rudder, the AV.2's pilot controlled yaw by differentially operating two pairs of airbrakes, each mounted near a wing tip and opening above and below the wing. The outer panels also carried ailerons. The only vertical surfaces on the wing were two fixed triangular fins, intended to reduce turbulence at each end of the unusual elevator designed by Peyret, mounted on the trailing edge of the centre section. It consisted of two geometrically similar surfaces, each of symmetrical section and joined to each other and to the wing without a gap. In plan the rear surface, though shorter, blended smoothly into the forward one. Together they formed a control surface with adjustable curvature, which could modify the profile of the centre section from symmetric to reflex. The pilot's controls were conventional; the airbrakes were controlled with a rudder bar which when rotated raised them differentially and when pressed forward opened them together as brakes. The ailerons and elevator operated by the usual control column. His seat was in an open cockpit at the leading edge of the wing, where a brief, rounded, enclosed forward extension carried a windscreen and pitot tube. The AV.2 was powered by a ABC Scorpion flat twin engine arranged in pusher configuration and driving a two blade propeller. It was contained in a tear-shaped pod that also held the fuel and oil tanks, mounted over the cockpit on a mast of steel tubes. It had a low, wide track tailskid undercarriage with its mainwheels semi-recessed into the centre section where it began to thin towards the outer panels. There were wheel brakes, operated like the airbrakes by forward pressure on the rudder bar, which came into operation when the airbrakes were more than half extended. The AV.2 was completed in 1932.

It is an ascidian tunicate in the family Polyclinidae. Ascidians are also known as sea squirts. Description Polyclinum planum colonies are variable in color ranging from olive greenish to brown to yellowish tan. Colonies of this species have a tough flexible peduncle located along one margin of the zooid-bearing lobe by which they are attached to a hard substrate. The pharynx of each zooid (colony member) has 13-17 rows of stigmata (ciliated openings) that they use for filter-feeding. The zooid- bearing lobe is roughly spherical in colonies less than 1 or 2 cm in diameter, the lobe becomes laterally compressed into sort of a tongue or pancake shape as the colony increases in size, and the lobe can be 2.5 to more than 10 times wider than it is thick. Each zooid in the colony maintains its own oral siphon (incurrent opening) while the cloacal siphon (excurrent opening) empties into a pocket-like cloacal opening that is shared by multiple zooids. Distribution and habitat The geographic range of P. planum extends from the lowest levels of the rocky intertidal zone to depths of 30+meters along the Pacific coast of North America, from northern California south to Baja, California A few species surveys report this species in Japan and Peru, but P. planum is best documented in California. Intertidal individuals are attached to sides and upper surfaces of rocks at -1.0 MLLW and below, while subtidal individuals are most typically found attached to vertical rock surfaces. Development and life history Young Polyclinum planum colonies appeared every month of the year at intertidal research plots at the southern end of Monterey Bay, California, USA, and these colonies survived on average for about 5.5 months, though the longest lived colony monitored to date lived 24 months. Colonies grow rapidly by a form of cloning described below. Because the growth of colonies of P. planum is indeterminate it becomes impossible to estimate a colony's age by its size after only a few months. Mature colonies produce eggs year round. The eggs develop into ascidian tadpole larvae, thus named because of their general similarity in shape to frog tadpoles, though ascidian tadpole larvae are much smaller and anatomically different than those of frog tadpoles. Embryos and larvae develop while residing in the excurrent atrium of the parent zooid, and larvae are released into the water when they are competent to swim. Once in the water these non-feeding larvae are initially photo-positive and swim upward for a 2‚Äì10 minutes when their behavior changes and they become photo-negative and swim to the bottom where they attach to any available hard substrate. Larvae undergo metamorphosis and become filter-feeding zooids within 5‚Äì15 minutes of settlement. A newly settled individual is called an oozoid and is the founding member of a new P. planum colony. The oozoid is covered by a protective outer covering that it secretes. This covering is called the tunic and is made of a cellulose material called tunicin. Cellulose is, by the way, a highly unusual material for any animal ro secrete since it is normally produced by plants. When an oozooid acquires sufficient size it undergoes a form of cloning called strobilation during which its body is pinched into 2 to 6 buds (also known as strobilae) which are still protected by the tunic. Each bud subsequently develops into a fully functional zooid by regeneration. When these daughter zooids get large enough they also undergo strobilation, and the colony increases in size as new zooids are produced. Because P. planum colonies increase in size through cloning, every zooid in a colony is genetically identical to each other. In addition, colonies of P. planum have never been observed to fragment as some other kinds of clonal animals do. Ecology The ecology of Polyclinum planum is not well documented, though like almost all other tunicates it makes its living by filter feeding, also known as suspension feeding. Rows of small cilia-lined openings called stigmata are found in the wall of this each zooid's large pharynx. Beating of cilia pulls water and small particles into the pharynx through the incurrent oral siphon. At the same time a long thin structure called the endostyle that is located along the ventral wall of the pharynx secretes a thin sheet of mucous that is continuously drawn dorsally along the inner walls of the pharynx. Water that enters the pharynx passes through the mucous sheet but particles including phytoplankton, detritus, etc., become trapped in the mucus which is continuously rolled into a rope and swallowed by the zooid at the dorsal margin of the pharynx. Water exiting the pharynx enters a space called the atrium and then exits the body via the cloacal siphon (excurrent opening). It's not a particularly exciting life style, but it's a living. P. planum is reported to harbor more kinds of surface bacteria and protists than another tunicate Cystodytes lobatus which apparently discourages bacterial settlement via chemical deterrents that P. planum lacks. The only known predator of P. planum is the leather seastar Dermasterias imbricata which is also known to feed on a wide variety of sponges, cnidarians, and ascidians though the impact of seastar predation on populations of P. planum is not known. Most prospective predators are believed to be discouraged from preying on P. planum due to high levels of polyclinal, a sulfated polyhydroxy benzaldehyde that it produces and which is found in highest concentrations in the outermost layer of tunic material. An unidentified amphipod crustacean is known to excavate a narrow slit in the outer tunic layer of intertidal P. planum, crawl into the slit with its carapace facing into the tunic and feeding appendages outward, and remain there indefinitely. This situation is definitely beneficial to the amphipod, but the effect of the relationship on the tunicate remains a mystery. The greatest known ecological threat to intertidal P. planum colonies is dislodgement by heavy surf or wave action, and larger colonies are more susceptible to being ripped off of rocks and washed away during a storm or in heavy surf than smaller colonies, Evidence from one study suggests that the intertidal range of P. planum, designated as a southern species along the Pacific coast of North America, may be shifting northward under the influence of warming due to global climate change References Category:Enterogona Category:Animals described in 1917 ","title":"Polyclinum planum"},{"id":"45691779","text":"Peg Woffington is a 1910 American silent historical film directed by Edwin S.

Biography  He obtained his primary education at the teacher training school in his hometown. It was there that he first developed his interests in painting, theater and antiquities. In 1901, he enrolled at the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, where he studied with and joined the local community of people from Kazanlak, known as \\"Rose Valley\\", after an area near their hometown. \\"Zahasia\\" (1924) During this time he also helped establish the \\"Department of Antiquities\\" at the \\"Iskra Town History Museum\\" and made his public d√©but with cartoons and illustrations for the local newspapers. Impressed by Professor Anton Mitov's lectures on art history, he began to write art criticism for the newspaper –î–µ–Ω (Today). He became so involved with this new interest, that he failed to attend his final exams at the Academy. He remained in Sofia a bit longer, then went to Munich, spending his days at the Alte Pinakothek, copying the Old Masters. In 1908, he returned home and donated fifteen of them to a new art museum. For the next few years, he exhibited his landscapes at the \\"Society of Artists of Bulgaria\\" in Sofia, but was not very successful. Instead, he decided to devote his energy to art research and critiques, written for –ú–∏—Ä (Peace), the official organ of the People's Party. Although this required living in Sofia, he continued to participate in the affairs of his hometown. Landscape (1917) In 1914, he entered a contest to create a new curtain for the main theater in Stara Zagora. Although his design was not chosen, it attracted the attention of Geo Milev and, two years later, he was invited to do the scenography for a production of Oedipus Rex. In 1918, he published a book on the ancient monuments of Dobruja. For almost twenty years, he worked as a researcher for the Ministry of Education and Science, producing numerous essays and monographs on Bulgarian art. He also continued to paint, producing portraits of notable figures such as Professor Marin Drinov and the politician . He also designed Kazanlak's first Coat of Arms. In 1927, he published his book of local history –†–æ–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞–Ω–ª—ä–∫ (The Rose Valley and Kazanlak). Following a stroke in 1936, he made a large donation to the art museum there; which included hundreds of books, decorations, costumes, icons and photographs.

Sequart also publishes books and produces documentary films. It was founded in 1996 by Dr. Julian Darius. Sequart's editor-in-chief is Mike Phillips. Through their publications, Sequart Organization bridges the gap between academia and fandom and makes scholarship on the medium accessible to the general public.  Name  The name Sequart is a portmanteau of \\"sequential art,\\" itself a term which was coined by Will Eisner in his book Comics and Sequential Art. Unlike terms such as comic books or graphic novels, which refer to a specific format, the term \\"sequart\\" refers to the medium itself, therefore including the aforementioned formats, but also comic strips, manga, illustrated fiction, picture books, and even sculpture, for example in form of Stations of the Cross. Accolades The Village Voice named Tom Shapira's Curing the Postmodern Blues as one of 2013's Best Graphic Novels saying, \\"a PhD-level explication... Shapira's treatise gathers up plot threads and illuminates character motivations to reveal the tale as an attempt, in Morrison's own words, 'to turn the very basic horrors of existence into comedy and poetry.'\\" In 2013, Latino Review named The Image Revolution \\"one of the best documentaries of the year.\\" In 2015, She Makes Comics won the award for best documentary at the Comic Con International Independent Film Festival.  Books  Sequart has published several scholarly non-fiction books on subjects related to the medium. Sequart's first book, about Batman Begins, was the first scholarly book ever published on Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. Published in 2005, it appeared prior to the film's release on home video, the first time an analytic book had ever been published so quickly following a movie's release. Sequart's second book was the first scholarly book about comics writer Grant Morrison. * Beard, Jim (Ed.). Gotham City 14 Miles: 14 Essays on Why the 1960s Batman TV Series Matters.

Background Kinthup, photographed in 1914 Sketch of rivers arising on Tibetan plateau North of Himalaya, the Yarlung Tsangpo River flows east through the Tibetan Plateau and then turns south into a series of massive gorges in Himalayan mountains. Until the 1880s it was unknown by which route it eventually reached the sea. It could have been any of the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Irrawaddy or Brahmaputra rivers all of which have headwaters this region. Kinthup, a Lepcha man from Sikkim employed as a pundit, had provided some evidence that the Tsangpo flowed into the Dihang (which is a tributary of the Brahmaputra) but he was not widely believed. By 1911 the connection was widely accepted. Another mystery remained: the river dropped from to in a distance of perhaps which is extremely steep for a river of this size. It seemed there must be a massive waterfall and, indeed, Kinthup had reported one high. Abor Expedition In 1911‚Äì12 as part of the Abor Expedition, the Survey of India conducted widespread surveying of the tributaries of the Brahmaputra. Morshead was in a team surveying the Dibang River while Frederick Bailey was surveying the Dihang.The Dibang and Dihang rivers are different tributaries of the Brahmaputra. Because it is now known the Tsangpo flows into the Dihang, the latter is now often regarded as a different name for the Brahmaputra in this region. Oakes and Field of the Dihang team were first to measure the height of the Namcha Barwa and, from Dibang, Morshead confirmed the height ‚Äì the separate measurements were able to provide a very accurate location. 1913 expedition Bailey and Morshead's map of the route of the expedition In 1913 Bailey, an intelligence officer with the Indian Army, invited Morshead to be the surveyor in an expedition to explore the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon (Tsangpo Gorge), now known to be the world's deepest gorge. Bailey and Morshead explored from the south with Morshead surveying the entire route and calculating the results as they went so as not to delay progress. By ascending the Dibang river and crossing the Yonggyap Pass () and the Himalayan watershed into Tibet, they reached the Dihang and started up the Gorge. When they were at Lagung, just east of Namcha Barwa, they were arrested by the Nyerpa of Pome who took them to Showa on the Po Tsangpo river. After they had been imprisoned for several days they were released. By following this river downstream to the west and then north they reached the Rong Chu valley where Bailey discovered a tall blue poppy - now known as Meconopsis baileyi - at a forest edge. They headed south to reach the Dihang river again, this time upstream of the Gorge and just south of Gyala Peri. Hence they penetrated the massive sweep of the Tsangpo Gorge, north east of Namcha Barwa. They were able to go downstream as far as Pemakoi-chen where they found the immense Tsangpo Gorge impassible. They were only about upstream of Lagung but they had to turn to the north to follow the Tsangpo upstream to Tsetang where they left the river and headed south through eastern Bhutan to Trashigang, eventually to arrive at Rangiya back in India. The expedition covered on foot and lasted from 16 May to 14 November 1913. Discoveries and outcome In doing this they proved that the Dibang tributary of the Brahmaputra flows around rather than through the Himalayan mountains and does not connect with the Tsangpo. They also proved conclusively that the Tsangpo‚ÄìDihang‚ÄìBrahmaputra was a single river and for the first time established its accurate course along what became known as the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon. The highest waterfall they found was and they considered there was unlikely to be a higher fall ‚Äì this came as a disappointment even to the professionals. For his work Morshead was awarded the Macgregor Medal by the United Service Institution of India. At the time the expedition was regarded as a great feat of exploration and it drew international acclaim.

Mazzei began his career in the late 1920s during the silent era including on the futuristic High Treason. By the 1930s he was working for Gainsborough Pictures, designing backdrops for the critically acclaimed train-set thriller Rome Express in 1932. His 1940s work includes Gainsborough Melodramas such as Madonna of the Seven Moons and The Magic Bow as well as the Film Noirs The Upturned Glass and They Made Me a Fugitive. In 1947 he was employed on the Technicolor film The Man Within.Spicer p. 67 Most of his final films during the early 1950s were lower budget crime thrillers. Early life Andrew Mazzei was born Andr√© Jean Louis Mazzei in Le Havre, France on 2 August 1887 to Italian / French parentage. His father, Giovanni Mazzei (born 1 August 1852 in Colognora di Val di Roggio, Pescaglia, Lucca, Tuscany, Italy - died 26 November 1930 in Lucca Hospital, Tuscany, Italy) was an Italian 'Plaster Figure Maker' who had moved to France to ply his trade. He married Andrew's mother, Evarestine Marie Lemen (born 29th Oct 1852 in Beauvoir, Vend√©e, France - died 28 June 1912 in Holborn, London, England) on 15 August 1881 in Nantes, France. The family moved to London, England in 1891, where they stayed until Andrew was nine years of age when his father took him to Italy for 12 months. On returning, the family lived for a short time in Brighton and Manchester, and by 1901 they had settled in Blackpool. It was during this time that Andrew's father had contributed ornate plasterwork to the Tower Ballroom designed by Frank Matcham. According to the 1911 census, Andrew had contributed decorative plasterwork to the Coronation Exhibition of George V. Andrew married Alice Fairclough (1887-1973) on 7 October 1912 at South Shore, Fylde, Lancashire. They had no children. During the First World War, Andrew was employed on the reconstruction of the late Lord Kitchener's house at Broome Park, Knowlton, Kent, where he was engaged on special modelling work. Andrew then went to work for a year for Messrs. Jordans, Brixton Hill, making artificial limbs for mutilated soldiers. On 14 March 1918, Andrew volunteered for the British Army and was graded 2. Messrs. Jordans pointed out to Andrew that the work he was engaged on was a necessity and applied for his exemption which was granted. After the war, Andrew then worked for Messrs. J. Panichelli & sons, Hammersmith, on architectural and plasterwork until 1921 when he found employment with the film company, the \\"Famous Players-Lasky British Producers Limited.\\" Selected filmography * Mademoiselle from Armenti√®res (1926) * The Flag Lieutenant (1926) * Hindle Wakes (1927) * Quinneys (1927) * Roses of Picardy (1927) * The Arcadians (1927) * The Glad Eye (1927) * Mademoiselle Parley Voo (1928) * Palais de Danse (1928) * The Flight Commander (1928) * The Physician (1928) * What Money Can Buy (1928) * Gibbs Advert (1929) * High Treason (1929) * The Devil's Maze (1929) * Alf's Button (1930) * Greek Street (1930) * The Great Game (1930) * The Night Porter (1930) * Thread O'Scarlet (1930) * A Gentleman of Paris (1931) * Bed and Breakfast (1931) * Bracelets (1931) * Down River (1931) * The Happy Ending (1931) * Hindle Wakes (1931) * No Lady (1931) * Rome Express (1932) * Night of the Garter (1933) * Prince of Arcadia (1933) * The Blarney Stone (1933) (costumes) * Two Hearts in Waltz Time (1934) * In Town Tonight (1935) * No Monkey Business (1935) * Ten Minute Alibi (1935) * The Case of Gabriel Perry (1935) * The Deputy Drummer (1935) * Turn of the Tide (1935) * A Woman Alone (1936) * Dusty Ermine (1936) * The Luck of the Irish (1936) * Spy of Napoleon (1936) * The Man Behind the Mask (1936) * The Man in the Mirror (1936) * Clothes and the Woman (1937) * The Missing Million (1942) * Front Line Kids (1942) * Gert and Daisy Clean Up (1942) * Rose of Tralee (1942) * Love Story (1944) (associate art director) * I'll Be Your Sweetheart (1945) * Madonna of the Seven Moons (1945) * The Magic Bow (1946) * Dancing with Crime (1947) * Just William's Luck (1947) * The Man Within (1947) * The Upturned Glass (1947) * They Made Me a Fugitive (1947) * Daughter of Darkness (1948) * The Small Voice (1948) * This Was a Woman (1948) * The Romantic Age (1950) (credited as Anthony Mazzei) * 13 East Street (1952) * Hindle Wakes (1952) * The Frightened Man (1952) * The Last Page (1952) * The Lost Hours (1952) * Wings of Danger (1952) References Bibliography * Spicer, Andrew.

Main characters Shido Itsuka : : :The protagonist of Date A Live. Shido is a kind-hearted and sympathetic young man who possesses a strange power that allows him to seal the powers of a Spirit in his body with a kiss; however, the seal will only work if the Spirit holds enough trust or affection toward him to allow it. This ability allows him to seal and contain 99% of a Spirit's power. After sealing a Spirit's powers, there will be an invisible link connecting him and the Spirit, through which a portion of the sealed power will flow back to the Spirit if said Spirit's mental state becomes unstable, and back to Shido once the Spirit's mental state stabilizes. In volume 5, he discovers he can access the powers of the Spirits, including Tohka's Sandalphon, other than Kotori's healing flames that he has sealed. While Shido normally maintains a close bond with each of the Spirits he saves throughout the course of the series due to promises he has made, he is most often shown to be particularly closest to Tohka. :After sealing the power of multiple Spirits, Shido's own power goes unstable in Volume 12, changing his personality and turning him into a threat. To restore Shido's normal self, Kotori and the other Spirits must come together to kiss him, so as to calm down his unbalanced sealed power, which will cause a disaster worse than what had happened 30 years ago. While having a completely different personality, Shido is conceited, displaying a dark demeanor and tends to 'impress' familiar people, by showcasing the powers of the Spirits he had sealed (In this case, the power belonging to Yoshino, Miku, Natsumi and Origami). Near the end of volume 12, during his date with Yoshino, DEM interfered and tried to capture Shido, but he destroyed the team of 20 Bandersnatch easily using a powerful spirit flash. Later, Shido's sealed powers went completely berserk during his date with Tohka due to the Second Spirit's noise calling out for him. Fortunately, Shido was saved by Phantom, who then weakened Shido's spirit barrier, so the Spirits can successfully break through to kiss him. :Assumed to have been abandoned by his birth mother, Shido lives with his foster sister Kotori. He has blue hair and brown eyes, and is in his second year in Raizen High School, class 2-4. He was in despair for a time after being abandoned and subsequently adopted, which made him sensitive to similar feelings from others and wanting to bring them out of it, fueling his desire to save the Spirits. He meets his real sister Mana Takamiya later in volume 3. In volume 7, Westcott briefly addresses him as Takamiya before switching back to Itsuka. :Volume 17 reveals more details about his origin: born Shinji Takamiya, he actually lived around the time the first spatial quake hit and met the First Spirit, a nameless entity in the form of a girl, whom he called Mio. Over time, Shinji taught her about the world and life and the two fell in love with each other; until Wescott attempted to capture Mio and killed Shinji in the process. In an attempt to bring him back to life, Mio absorbed Shinji's corpse into her body and recreated him as a human/Spirit hybrid, explaining Shido's ability to seal and manifest Spirit powers. As it turns out, Mio has been distributing Sephira crystals among humans to perfect and refine their powers so that, in time, Shido can obtain them and become a being of unlimited magical power like herself so they can be together for all eternity. Tohka Yatogami Cosplayer of Tohka Yatogami. : : :Tohka is the first Spirit saved by Shido. She transfers into his class at the end of the first volume. Shido named her after the day of their first meeting, April 10th (though one kanji is different, the tenth day of a month is pronounced as Tohka). Reine later added the Yatogami surname for her. She has long dark purple hair and purple eyes. She is ignorant of the ways of the world, but nevertheless has a normal sense of embarrassment. As Shido was the first person to ever show kindness and acceptance towards her, Tohka develops strong feelings for him, which she is initially shown to be unable to understand when she gets jealous after seeing Shido accidentally kiss Yoshino. However, upon learning that Yoshino is a Spirit like herself, she decides to support Shido in his cause to save other Spirits such as Kurumi. She not only participates in battles at times, but even provides comfort and emotional support for Shido whenever he finds himself faced with a dilemma. As of volume 12, Tohka comes to fully realize that she is in love with Shido. :Tohka gets captured once by DEM Industries at the end of volume 6. Then in volume 7 upon seeing Shido ambushed and about to be killed by Ellen, she is filled with such despair that she underwent a transformation called Inversion, becoming noticeably far more hostile, and attacking everyone in sight, including Shido. Fortunately, Shido manages to bring Tohka back to her senses by kissing her. Westcott calls her Inverse state the Demon King, adding that this transformed state is the actual form of Spirits like her in the bordering dimension that they come from before manifesting in this world. :Her Angel is Sandalphon, which takes the form of a broadsword, usually with a throne that doubles as the scabbard, although at times it seems as though she can do just as much damage with or without it, using her hands to project dark energy spheres or bolts in order to slice through inanimate objects with ease. Her Astral Dress, Adonai Melek, consists of a purple ballgown. At full power she shatters the throne (volume 1) and combines the pieces with the sword turning the blade into Halvanhelev (the Last Sword) lengthening the blade several meters long, dramatically increasing her powers and can be charged to unleash an ultimate blow. Fortunately, the one time she used Halvanhelev Shido was able to stop and seal her before the unstable energy was unleashed. When she falls into utter despair, her Angel changes to Nahemah, the Qliphoth counterpart of Sandalphon and her Astral Dress becomes darker in color and more revealing. Her AST and Ratatoskr codename is . * : :The original personality of Tohka Yatogami, who was born from the crystal of Sephira Malchut. Also known as Inversion or Dark Current. Shadow awakens and captures Tohka's body if Tohka is exposed to the strongest influence of negative emotions. Kotori Itsuka Cosplayer of Kotori Itsuka. : : :Kotori is Shido's foster sister and the commander of Ratatoskr. Her parents are also employees of Ratatoskr. Originally she was a human but gained the power of a Spirit five years ago, at the same time she was saved by Shido. There is no record of how Kotori obtained her Spirit powers; does not know why her and Shido's memories seem vague or missing from that crucial point. When her Spirit powers overwhelm her, she retains almost no memories of any events that transpire during that time. She temporarily takes back her powers from Shido to save him from Kurumi with her power being sealed by Shido once more later on. The reason another sealing was needed was because Kotori took all 100% of her power back breaking the Spirit Link between them that would cause her powers to return to Shido when she calmed down. At the second sealing, she and Shido both regain their lost memories of the first sealing: an entity called granted her Spirit powers when she was left alone at home and crying (with which she destroyed everything around her and nearly killed Shido), told her to kiss Shido if she wanted him to live (which was how Kotori knew about the method to seal a Spirit's powers, and also the ability to heal from serious injuries that Shido got from her), and afterwards stripped them of their memories of its existence, as well as the entire incident. This memory also disproves Origami's belief that Kotori was the one who killed her parents. Kotori is the first/third Spirit saved by Shido. :She has long red hair, often in twin tails, and her eyes are red. She is almost always shown with a Chupa Chups lollipop in her mouth. She displays two very different characters, bordering on split personality. When she wears white ribbons in her hair, she is completely relaxed and peaceful and shows an immature, spoiled character that's always clinging to her brother. When on Ratatoskr's mothership, Fraxinus, or dealing with major situations, she switches to black ribbons taking on an arrogant, superior attitude to everyone including Shido, but nevertheless still cares deeply for him as shown on many occasions. This difference in character is revealed in volume 4 to be due to Shido giving Kotori black ribbons as a present for her ninth birthday after sealing her powers, and telling her to be strong as long as she wears them. However she is extremely weak to horror-related things, and reacts strongly to them regardless of character. :Her Angel is Camael, a halberd with a flame edge that is capable of changing shape to cannon that extends to her right elbow. The cannon takes some time to charge up and absorb Kotori's flames and has a devastating attack that blew a hole clean through Zaphkiel and almost killed Kurumi. Kotori with her powers has the ability to recover from severe injuries, which Shido is able to use unconsciously while her powers are sealed inside him. It‚Äôs represented by healing flames coming out of the wounds. Her Astral Dress, Elohim Gibor (meaning \\"Almighty God\\" in Hebrew), is a kimono which mainly consists of the colors pink and cream. In her Spirit form she also has horns growing on her head, with her black ribbons tied on them. Her irises are also a slightly brighter tint of pink in this state. Her AST codename is . Origami Tobiichi Cosplayer of Origami Tobiichi. : : :Origami is a highly intelligent classmate of Shido who is athletic, \\"beautiful\\", and the most famous person in Shido's school. She is often described as doll-like in appearance with short white hair and blue-grey eyes. She somehow knew Shido from a time he had comforted her in a distress state that he just doesn't recall at all. She is the only human \\"girlfriend\\" of Shido, and out of all the other girls who like him, she is the most aggressive in her pursuit of him showing no bounds in her attempts to learn more about him, get closer to him, or even on trying to get more intimate with him. Her hatred of Spirits stems from a Spirit who killed her parents five years prior when it blasted her parents after they managed to escape their burning home. Due to this, she joined the AST, in which she holds the rank of Master Sergeant, in an attempt to find the Spirit supposedly responsible for the fire and kill her. She managed to utilize the Ace CR-Unit , when reluctantly believing Shido who tells her that while Kotori, who turns out to be Efreet, unintentionally started the fire, she did not kill Origami's parents and that there were several Spirits involved. :This singular aim of revenge has enough drive within her to overcome her calm, calculating, and composed personality for her to go to the extent of disregarding orders and hysteria, getting her into trouble on more than one occasion. Notably, she was about to be discharged from the AST in volume 5 until Westcott intervened, after which her punishment was reduced to two months of not being allowed to use Realizers. At the end of volume 9, Origami left the AST to join DEM as a wizard, only for a short time. :In volume 10, a corrupted Origami lured Shido into a trap and later attempted to kill the Spirits with him out of the way, but was eventually defeated by Tohka. Origami just then heard the noise of Phantom and is granted with the power of a Spirit. Unfazed, she persuaded Kurumi to send her to the past in an attempt to fend off Phantom who at the time she thought was the Spirit who caused her parents' deaths, five years prior. However, Origami was proven wrong just moments after she fended Phantom away, and the truth hit her very hard. Recognizing the extensive damage caused by Origami's light beams and remembering the silhouette of an angel, she realized who killed her parents‚ÄîOrigami herself. Upon returning from the past in an emotionless despair state, Origami started attacking the hospital, the Fraxinus and the surroundings where Shido and the other Spirits are at. Shido bent on reverting Origami to her normal self, now that she is beyond recovery. Requesting Kurumi's help, she and Shido trip to the past and comforted a young Origami who is in despair on losing her parents. At that moment, Shido and Kurumi realized that their actions have indirectly influence Origami's behavior in the future. During a second trip, he manages to save Origami's parents from her future self's attack, drastically altering Origami's future. :Here in the new timeline, Origami has long hair and a different personality as compared to her previous timeline self. The irony of fate is her parents still died due to a car accident. She also was an ex-AST member, but this time her reason for joining and leaving were different. Despite the time changed, Origami actually still manifests her Spirit power with all her previous timeline memories. Origami was invited by Shido to a date but turns into upon seeing Efreet's flames healing Shido's wound. With the help of the other Spirits, Shido managed to reach the inverse Origami who was fighting over the control of her body with her previous timeline self. Origami finally succeeded in gaining control over her body and broke free. Shido then took this chance to kiss Origami and sealed her power. At the end of the volume, Shido told Origami that he'll be depending on her (as part of the Spirit team) for any future incidents and she accepted with a smile. Since the beginning Origami only saw Shido as reliance on her emotions, but after he saves her she sincerely comes to love him and dreams of having a family with Shido. She becomes the eighth Spirit saved by Shido. :Her angel is Metatron which is a large crown that floats around her head, which can call out larger pieces of floating golden pillars that seem to resemble to a larger crown that surrounds her. Her powers are mainly the control of light energy. In her inverse form, her Astral Dress, Ehyeh, turns dark and becomes more revealing. Kotori called the inversed Origami a 'worst spirit' comparable to Kurumi. Her codename is . Mio Takamiya : :Mio is the \\"First Spirit\\" born when the gather all of the world's mana in a single location by the work of Isaac Westcott, Elliot Woodman, and Ellen Mathers, thirty years prior. However, her birth involuntarily caused the first spatial quake to occur, which destroyed a huge part of Eurasia. Mio had the mentality of an infant, and continuously fluctuated between reality and another dimension that was created as a result of her birth. Because of this, smaller spatial quake would happen every time she appeared in the world, which would ravage the world a few months after her birth. Her codename is . :One day, she was approached by a boy named Shinji Takamiya, who gave the naked girl his jacket and decided to bring her home with him. Mio received her name of their first meeting, 30th. Shinji also gave her key insight on the concept of love. While living with Shinji and Mana, Mio quickly started to gain self-awareness of the real world by reading books, following the radio and watching television and cassettes. One time, Shinji took Mio around town and told her about everything that caught her attention. Mio was so overjoyed that she cried. Apparently, however, DEM uncovered Mio's location, forcing her to flee with Shinji. While running, Woodman appeared before them, but he allowed them to pass after asking Mio if she is happy being with Shinji. Despite this, Westcott revealed that he had abducted Mana but was willing to trade her for Mio. Denying him, Westcott shot Shinji in the chest using a gun. This caused Mio to finally realize how much Shinji meant to her and escaped. Her personality and demeanor change from very melancholic to extreme goal driven, including a willingness to sacrifice countless humans to achieve her wish. :Mio absorbed Shinji's corpse into her and recreates him by nurturing \\"Shido\\" in her womb before giving birth to him‚Äîbecoming his new mother. Her plan was to entrust him with her power so that he could become her eternal lover. Since the body of a normal human is frail to accept all her power at once, Mio only gave Shido the power to take in the Spirit's power. Then, she divided her power, planting them like seeds into young girls in order for Shido to gradually take their powers one by one. However, humans were not compatible with the Qlipha Crystals she created, causing them to turn into monsters and go berserk. Therefore, Mio decided to reverse their properties, turning them into Sephira Crystals to make them more compatible, starting with Nia Honjou. Around this time, Mio successfully gave birth to Shido, and left him to be adopted by the Itsuka family. :At some point, one of the berserk Spirits attacked a young Kurumi Tokisaki, though Mio managed to save her, still willing trick Kurumi into becoming a Spirit under the premise of being an ally of justice who was saving the world from Spirits. One day, however, Kurumi invited Mio over to her friend Sawa Yamauchi's place. This caused Mio to be caught in the act of removing the Qlipha Crystal from the body of the Efreet Spirit, who was revealed to be none other than Sawa. This revelation caused Kurumi to start transforming into her Inverse Form. However, much to Mio's surprise, Kurumi stopped her transformation by using her Fourth Bullet to reverse time and return to a moment before she started feeling overwhelmed by despair. Mio sincerely apologizes and states that she had no ill will towards Kurumi, but she cannot stop until she had entrusted her power to those chosen among humanity. Spirits Spirits are extraterrestrial beings whose arrival is usually preceded by a spatial quake. These spatial quakes are usually involuntary, but they can also cause spatial quakes voluntarily. Each Spirit has a numerical kanji in their name. They also each possess an Astral Dress as well as an Angel, which are respectively named after the Divine Names of the Sephiroth of the Kabbalistic Tree of life corresponding to the numerical kanji in their names, and the archangels governing the corresponding Sephirot. Each Spirit has a unique ability, and each displays different levels of knowledge about Earth. When a Spirit inverses so does the angel who gets replaced by a demon of the corresponding Qliphoth, e.g. Tohka's angel Sandalphon of her Malkuth Sephira is replaced by the demon Nahemah associated with the corresponding Qimranut Qliphah, and Tobichi's angel Metatron of Kether Sephira by Satan of the Bacikal Qliphah. It is later revealed that the source of a Spirit's power is a gem known as a Sephira Crystal. When a human is exposed to a crystal, they receive whatever power the crystal stores inside. Identified Spirits =Yoshino Himekawa= Cosplayer of Yoshino Himekawa. : : :The second Spirit saved by Shido. She has the appearance of a young girl around Kotori's age, with long blue hair and matching eyes. She has a very shy personality, depending on her rabbit puppet in her left hand, Yoshinon, most of the time for communication. She is a very docile Spirit, and does not attack the AST when they attack her, not even summoning her Angel, reasoning that if she does not like being hurt, they would also not like it. However when she loses [Yoshinon] she will be at a loss, and when attacked will summon her Angel, but only to defend herself. Shido meets her seemingly to be a lost child in the rain. After several encounters, Shido made the decision to protect Yoshino for her incredible kindness, and aid her to speak precisely for herself other than rely on Yoshinon. :Her Angel is Zadkiel, a giant rabbit puppet that she summons and controls with her right hand. It is capable of breathing out freezing air that freezes the AST members along with their territory. Other than her Angel, she is also capable of manipulating the three states of water, but is usually seen manipulating ice, however there is a tiny amount of Spirit Energy in each drop of the rain that appears whenever she manifests herself in this world. Her Astral Dress, El, consists of a green rabbit suit and a white petticoat. Her AST codename is . * :A split personality that was born out of Yoshino's wish to not be alone and not have her powers hurt others. It is Yoshino's ideal self, as well as her friend. Unlike Yoshino, it speaks out with confidence and is prone to offending others. It acts as Yoshino's pillar of support, allowing her to keep calm enough to not attack others. It usually does the speaking for Yoshino, appearing to speak through ventriloquism by her doing, but their thoughts are independent of each other, and she has no control over what it says. Yoshinon's personality only comes out while Yoshino is wearing the puppet and both personalities consider the puppet to be Yoshinon. Yoshino is always the human shaped spirit Yoshino, Yoshinon is always the puppet so there are never any cases where Yoshinon takes over Yoshino's body, other than the arm holding the puppet, and Yoshino never becomes the puppet. =Kurumi Tokisaki= Cosplayer of Kurumi Tokisaki. : : :The most dangerous Spirit that appears in the series. Kurumi transfers into Shido's class in volume 3 and even announces that she is a Spirit. She is attracted to Shido from the very start, gaining the envy of Tohka and Origami. However, Kurumi reveals to Shido that she transferred to Raizen High School in order to eat him, or specifically the power that he has within him, to gain a large amount of life. Her left eye is an inorganic golden clock face, representing her remaining time (essentially measuring how much life she has left). Although she is prone to killing people without a second thought, there is a twisted justice to her actions, and she cares a bit about animals. She has so far only killed humans who are delinquents, and has a history with Mana, as Mana has been repeatedly killing Kurumi, but fails due to the fact that Kurumi keeps reappearing through the use of her clones. After a failed attempt to dissuade Kurumi on a triple date, a battle occurred on the school's rooftop and Kurumi retreats from Kotori's overwhelming power, after which Kurumi no longer attends the school. In the volume's epilogue Kurumi is seen regaining her time using her shadow powers to absorb the life of people within a building just enough to knock them out for a bit, but without killing them to \\"avoid attracting attention\\". She seems to have taken a genuine liking to Shido as she appears in several side stories forcing him to do something with her for fun, but without trying to \\"eat\\" or kill him. :She reappears to help Shido rescue Tohka who has been captured by DEM Industries and roaming on the streets alone due to Miku's intervention. It is revealed that Kurumi had been looking for and had failed to find the \\"Second Spirit\\", who was captured by DEM and held somewhere, and was the only one who knew the location and identity of the \\"First Spirit\\", the one that caused the spatial quake 30 years ago. In the middle of volume 10, Kurumi helped Origami return to the past on her request, and then sends Shido back 5 years meeting Kurumi's past-self on her behalf for resolve Origami, as her current berserk state, is unstoppable. In volume 12, Kurumi tried to retrieve the Second Spirit from a DEM plane carrying the spirit, but destroyed by Shido's spirit power earlier on and found out that she had escaped. After Origami's appearance in the new timeline and the conflict with Mukuro is resolved, Kurumi resurfaces before who has also retained memories of the original world; Shido, Tohka, and Origami are stunned to see Kurumi has return to school. Kurumi stipulates a challenge between Shido and her; whoever makes the other fall in love first will be able allowed to accomplish his or her goal. Throughout most of the series, Kurumi strongly refused to have her powers sealed by Shido for the sake of her goal. After she comes to fully realize that she is in love with him, however, she later willingly has them sealed in Volume 19 so as to give Shido the power he needed to deal with Mio, the First Spirit. :Her Angel is Zaphkiel, which takes the form of a massive clock face with a musket and a flintlock pistol taking the place of the minute and hour hands of the clock, and which allows her to control time. She is able to summon her past selves to fight or take her place as they are essentially Kurumi herself. This not only allows her to cheat death by summoning herself from before her death, but also makes it more difficult for Shido to reach her; such as when Shido was able to persuade a clone on top of the school but was interrupted when she killed that version of herself for showing weakness, circumventing any emotional persuasions the same way as physical injuries. From within her shadow they can reach out their arms and grab people to hold them or to drag them into the shadow which somehow ends up with the person seeming to have exploded when the area is shown later. While in her Astral Dress, she wears her black hair in twin tails, with the hair on her left side longer than her right. While not in her Astral Dress, her hair is tied up slightly differently, with both sides being of the same length except for the fringe covering her left eye, showing only her red right eye. :The twelve Roman numerals on the clock have different powers that only the original Kurumi can use. She has twelve different abilities she can use, which are named after the first twelve Hebrew numerals. The abilities she has shown so far include First Bullet: Aleph (which speeds up time, allowing the target to move faster), Second Bullet: Bet (which slows down time and causes the target to move slower), Fourth Bullet: Dalet (which reverses time and which can undo injuries the target sustains), Seventh Bullet: Zayin (which stops time, freezing the target and preventing it from moving), Eighth Bullet: Het (which makes clones of the target, these clones being cloned from a past form of the target, and this ability being the secret behind her past selves and why she keeps reappearing after being killed), and Tenth Bullet: Yud (which allows her to see the past experiences of the target). Her power causes her life to be eaten away, the clock hands on her eye rapidly turning in the clockwise direction each time she uses Zaphkiel's power. This forces her to obtain \\"time\\" from outside sources, specifically from either killing other humans using her shadows, or using the City of Devouring Time to weaken those caught in her shadows to strengthen herself. In addition, the real reason she wanted to gather a large amount of time is to not only be able to use Twelfth Bullet: Yud Bet to go back 30 years in time to kill the First Spirit, but also to have enough left over to do the deed. Her AST codename is . =Yamai= : :Together, they are the fourth/fifth Spirit saved by Shido. Similar in age to Shido, Kaguya and Yuzuru are identical twins, even being described as \\"clones\\" since they both split from the same Yamai Spirit, with the reason for the split as well as the original Yamai's personality both being unknown. Although they are two different, independent individuals, strictly speaking they are still one Spirit, Yamai. They both have long orange hair and mercury colored eyes. They are well known to people who know about Spirits as well as the general population due to causing a major atmospheric change when they duel while having a significant amount of witnesses. However the spatial quakes they cause have few to no casualties due to them manifesting high up in the sky. Their constant duels stem from both of them arguing about who is the real Yamai. Both of them have dueled in various fashions, with 25 wins apiece and 49 draws after 99 matches. Upon seeing Shido they agreed their 100th and final match to be who can seduce him first. :However deep down they each wanted the other to live, resulting in the both of them asking Shido to choose the other. When they learned of each other's true thoughts, they got angry enough at each other for not wanting to live, to fight again, this time to see who would run out of energy first. The real winner is revealed to be decided by who loses the winner disappears, or \\"survival of the weakest.\\" However Shido managed to stop them and give them the option of both living on as Yamai, as well as him sealing both their powers together. They both realized that what they really wanted, was for both to live on together. Being grateful to him for giving them that option, they kiss him together, which seals their powers. They join Shido's school, transferring to class 2-3, the class beside Shido's. :Their Angel is Raphael, whose true form is a bow and arrow weapon, El Kanaph, which has a high penetration capability, and is formed by combining their weapons. They both possess the power to control air currents. Their Astral Dresses, Elohim Tzabaoth, are visually masochistic, being covered in a dark colored coat with various parts of their bodies being covered by straps, Kaguya's being purple and Yuzuru's being blue. Both also have locks which possess torn off chains protruding from them, Kaguya's being on her neck, right hand, and right leg, and Yuzuru's being on her neck, left hand, and left leg. Their Ratatoskr codename is . * : :Her personality is outgoing and very highly spoken of herself to the point that she doesn't always think statements through. The resulting effects from her outspokenness can make her seem childish or immature. She has her long orange colored hair braided up. Her main weapon is El Re'em, a lance. * : :Personality-wise, she speaks in a distinctive manner in an almost robotic structure with her intent of the statement stated beforehand in a one word sentence. She is reserved however she will not hesitate to point out the flaws within Kaguya's arguments. She looks identical to Kaguya, albeit being slightly more well-endowed than her twin. Other differences include her hair being braided into three portions and her expression appears listless. Her main weapon is El Nahash, a chain. =Miku Izayoi= Cosplayer of Miku Izayoi. : : :The sixth Spirit saved by Shido. Miku first appears in volume 6 of the series and season 2 of the anime. She is introduced as a student of Rind≈çji Girls' Academy who resents humankind, especially men. She also works as a very famous and popular idol singer. She has violet hair and eyes, and she is always seen with a yellow flower-shaped hair clip in her hair. Shido's initial approach with Miku ended badly, so he cross-dresses as a girl called Shiori to get close to Miku until she finds \\"Shiori\\" is unaffected by her angel Solo and really becomes curious to have \\"her\\". Shido finds Miku annoying for not understanding fairness and people's well-being. After Miku challenged Shiori to a performance bet at Tengu Square and lost, Miku still refuses Shiori's general friendship only to get greatly shocked from discovering Shido's true gender and causes all eyewitnesses to fall under her voice control (except Tohka) to forcefully see if men like Shido can truly care about others than oneself. :At the age of 15, Miku begun her career as an idol singer using the stage name . However, when she refuses to sleep with a TV producer to resolve her album, rumors about scandals began to spread and eventually, her agent and male fans abandon her. She attempts to reconnect with her fans by singing, but suffers psychogenic aphonia on stage and loses her voice. This leads her to contemplate suicide until Phantom approaches her and gives her current Spirit powers. Eventually, after Shido rescues Tohka and proves his vow to become Miku's fan no matter what the risk, she deliberately initiates the kiss to allow him to seal her powers and begins to sing again for everyone. She loves Shido to the point of professing that he is her 'darling' around others. :Her Angel is Gabriel, which takes the form of an organ complete with speakers, through which she can transmit and strongly amplify her voice, and by extension her sound-based powers, of which she has demonstrated three so far: March, which enhances the listeners' physical strength, Rondo, which generates sound pressure in the form of a wall and is her primary form of defense and attack, and Solo, which brainwashes her listeners to cause them to be devoted to her, but can be blocked out by a pair of earplugs. A devoted follower will refer to Miku as Onee-sama (formal Japanese for big sister) and think or do things they normally wouldn't do, even if unasked, to help her out no matter how insane the action, such as what Kotori and crew were about to do as punishment to all the people, especially Shido, who had hurt Miku before being interrupted. Her Astral Dress, Shaddai El Chai, adds a yellow crescent moon to the hair clip, as well as a number of white flowers in her hair. The Astral Dress itself consists of a mainly yellow dress with some blue parts as well as white frills. Her Ratatoskr codename is . =Natsumi= : : :The seventh Spirit is Natsumi who first appears in Volume 8 saved by Shido. Her initial appearance is a healthy young adult, but her true form is a sickly little girl. In both of these forms, she has emerald colored hair and eyes. She acts hostile towards Shido after believing that he saw her true form (which he did not actually see). As the beginning of her revenge, she disguises as Shido in his school to try and ruin his life, but she was found out by the real Shido, as well as Tohka and Origami who saw through her disguise by the smallest details. She later threatens Shido in which he has to find out who she was disguising as in one of the twelve photos of missing people he knows. After Shido finds out who she was disguising as, Haniel, for some reason, has its mirror break which releases the people who were already captured. Natsumi, who was in a nervous state, had also reverted into her true form in front of Shido and his friends who were captured. Most likely this was because Shido 'won' the game which shattered Haniel's mirror breaking all the spells it was maintaining, such as the one imprisoning the others and the other one making Natsumi look like a voluptuous young adult. As Natsumi felt embarrassed from having her true form seen, she transforms back into her adult form and alters Shido and the others into children, and flies away on Haniel. :In Volume 9, her hiding place was later found by the Fraxinus and Natsumi escaped to an inhabited mountain side. There, she was attacked by Ellen and got heavily injured. Shido and the other Spirits rescued Natsumi then transported to the Fraxinus. Kotori and the others affected by Natsumi's magic were turned back to normal as well as her transformation ability was released when she lost consciousness. Natsumi was later brought to an underground facility in the city owned by Ratatoskr where Shido attempted to seal her powers with the help of Kotori and the others present. However, his plan failed when Natsumi escaped from the underground facility after having too much negative thought about the great treatment Shido & the others gave her. Natsumi later assisted Shido and the five Spirits to stop three artificial satellites sent by DEM from destroying Tenguu City which they succeeded in doing so. Natsumi then initiates the kiss with Shido to allow her powers to be sealed, upon being satisfied by Shido's response on a question and request to confirm how important she is to him. :Her Angel is Haniel, which takes the form of a broomstick. Its ability can transform the target into any form Natsumi wants. This can be people, objects, whatever she desires. The angel has a gem on the tip that can turn into a mirror which can entrap anyone inside. Her power can also be used on Haniel itself to mimic another Spirit's Angel and its abilities, but to a lesser degree. For example, she used it against DEM's third satellite by mimicking Tohka's Sandalphon, to create an attack wave of her own. Her codename is . =Nia Honjou= : :The \\"Second Spirit\\", and Nia is also the ninth Spirit first mentioned in volume 7. She has the appearance of a girl in her late teens with grey hair and blue eyes, she is confirmed to be at least 45 having been one of the first humans to be transformed into a Spirit after the event 30 years ago. Before being captured by DEM, she was a highly successful manga artist, under the pseudo-name S≈çji Honj≈ç, the author of one of Shido's favorite manga, \\"Silver Bullet\\" (which having been written long ago made him assume S≈çji was her father before she corrected him). Due to the abilities of her angel, she doesn't trust people, and only loves \\"2-D\\" since the characters are always as they are perceived without hiding anything about their persons or their history, which made her an obsessive otaku as a result. She refers to Shido as \\"Boy\\" in a teasing sort of older sister figure way, as well as other nicknames for the other Spirits as well. :After having been accidentally freed by Inverse Shido in Volume 12, Nia returned to her usual lifestyle, but was found collapsed outside her apartment by Shido as he walked home carrying groceries, having fainted from hunger. After feeding and helping her shop for manga, Shido attempted to seal her by cosplaying as a character from one of her favorite series, only to slip up with the character's actions and personality whilst trying to seal her, which caused her to hate him. An attempt by Ratatoskr to make her fall for a game character identical to Shido backfired when Nia discovered that the company who made the game was related to Ratatoskr, then she was challenged by Kotori and the other Spirits in a competition to see who could sell the most manga at a convention, which she accepted. Despite the efforts of the Spirits, even making some calls to friends, and even Miku's fans to try and out sell, Nia's manga won the competition, only for her to agree to read it regardless. When Nia discovered that the manga itself was a retelling of Shido's attempts to save the Spirits as told from their perspective (after having confirmed that this all happened and that they were happy he did), she relented. However, before she could be sealed, DEM unblocked her memories of all the torture she went through the past five years, which caused her psyche to collapse and begin to turn Inverse. After Artemisia removed her Qlipha Crystal from her and was absorbed by Westcott, Shido kisses Nia to seal her remaining powers before the removal process inducted on her could kill her. After going having her condition stabilized, she revealed that there are no \\"pure\\" Spirits, and that all Spirits present were once human like she was. :Her Angel, Ratziel, takes the form of a tome (more specifically a bible) and holds the ability to uncover facts, both general knowledge and also the person life histories of given people. An additional power of Ratziel is the ability to write a small insert into the future to cause an event to happen regardless, in fact what Nia writes in the book will become reality. As she did by drawing a sketch of Shido falling on top of Tohka during their visit to the shrine on New Year's Day in Volume 14. Having lost her Qlipha crystal and subsequently by Westcott, Nia can search for information, but that said information is no longer perceivable, and the use of her second ability is also limited. Her codename is . =Mukuro Hoshimiya= : :The tenth spirit to appear and is the 9th to be saved by Shido, who first appeared in Volume 14. She has golden colored hair and amber eyes, and has an archaic way of speaking, even referring to herself in third person as \\"Muku\\" („ÇÄ„Åè). Due to the solitude she was feeling in space, she sealed her own \\"heart\\" in order to cope in the vast emptiness, which made her only think logically, but with an icy cold, robot- like, demeanor. After having her emotions unsealed with a copy of her Angel via Haniel, Mukuro regained her true personality, which in contrast to her sealed one, is very emotional. Mukuro approaches the Fraxinus and Westcott's for invading her territory in emptiness of the cosmos. She takes things like love very seriously, forbidding Shido from being with the other Spirits and even going as far as to seal away their memories of him. Despite sealing the memories of all Shido's allies, the action inadvertently awakened Inverse Tohka and Origami's previous self, which both trio compete on a nonchalant date with Shido. :Mukuro was a lonely child who grew up without a family. One day, a couple adopted her along with an older sister, and would live in the warmth that she wanted. The older sister complements her hair while styling it, and they often went stargazing together. However, Mukuro is hurt when her sister had changed from always praising her golden hair and tells her to cut it now while a friend of her sister commented it. Feeling that her family will not adore her as they used to, she gains a newfound power given from Phantom, Mukuro locked the memories of every acquaintance of her family so that they would love only her, but backfires, as her family angrily rebuked her in return, terrified at how she suddenly obtained an unfathomable power. Unable to bear the rejection of a once blissing family, she then sealed her own memories and heart before departing for space. She also deeply loves her long hair and became furious when Inverse Tohka cut it. A fight arises on Tengu Tower's observation deck. Distressed of Mukuro's pure unadulterated love, Shido uses Haniel to forge a duplicate of Michael to unlock her emotions otherwise talking to her is useless. Shido figures out her past and empathized with their childhood abandonment. Afterwards, Mukuro releases the locked memories while referring Shido as her family, and permits that he be the only one she is willing to allow in cutting her hair. :Her Angel is Michael, which takes the form of a large key, which has the ability to lock or unlock abilities or procedures on a large number of different, such as turning off controls of spacecrafts, opening and closing wormholes, forcing gravitational pull on meteors and even sealing her own emotions. It has a third ability called release, which releases her and other Spirit's full spiritual power. Her codename is . =Reine Murasame= : : :Reine is the analyst onboard the Fraxinus, she is a non-certified medic who can perform simple first aid tasks. On the second day of the semester, she transfers into Shido's school as his assistant homeroom teacher. She is soft spoken, often speaking in a nonchalant manner who seems to have a physically weak stature and always seems to be tired. She even says that she has not slept for 30 years. :It is revealed in Volume 16 that she is the enigmatic entity known as Phantom and Mio's doppelganger. A mysterious entity is who gave humans their Spirit powers. It's heavily implied that Reine is assisting Mio to offer females the Sephira Crystals. This was done by offering them a gem that dissolved into their hands infusing them with the power of a Spirit. Whenever meeting someone Reine always conceals her identity by turning her appearance and voice into 'noise' so while people know she's there and can 'hear' her voice in their minds, nobody can discern or remember what Phantom looked or sounded like (even on camera) so her whole identity, including gender, is hidden. Reine is also the one who told Kurumi about where the \\"Second Spirit\\" to show on Earth may be held in along with the information that Shido holds the powers equivalent to three Spirits within him. She stated Origami was the best girl to turn into a Spirit and is surprised that she is rebelling against her. Irregular Spirits These spirits does not appear in the Light Novel and are not part of the series' main canon, only featured in games and films based on it. =Rinne Sonogami= : : :A character exclusive to the game Date A Live: Rinne Utopia. She's Shido's childhood friend. Her code name is Ruler. =Maria Arusu= : : :A character exclusive to the game Date A Live: Ars Install.

She's a mysterious young Spirit who is the daughter of Shido and Rinne. =Mayuri= : : :A character exclusive to the feature film Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgement, Mayuri is a Spirit born from energy unconsciously emitted by Tohka, Yoshino, Kotori, Kaguya, Yuzuru, and Miku due to their jealousy over Shido, which gathers into a massive sphere of energy that only Shido himself, and for some reason Kurumi were able to detect. Once knowing the source of the energy, Kotori decides that Shido must have an individual date with each of the girls in order to get them satisfied enough for the sphere to disappear. During the dates, Shido has a few glimpses of Mayuri watching over him, but after she finally makes contact with him, the sphere reveals itself as Mayuri's angel, which traps her. Shido and his friends join forces to defeat the angel and rescue Mayuri, but when she finally kisses him, sealing her powers, Mayuri disappears without a trace, as she lacks a physical body, much to Shido and the others' sadness. :Her Angel is Kerubiel, first manifesting itself as a massive sphere of energy, later converting itself as a massive cage that restrains Mayuri, and ultimately into a lance that fires a massive blast of energy, strong enough to handle the attacks of Shido's six Spirits at once, as it was created from their residual energy combined. It could only be damaged by Tohka after the other spirits shared their energy with her to give her more power. It was only stopped with its energy source cut after Mayuri sealed herself by kissing Shido, even knowing that it would bring an end to her existence as well. =Ren= : : :A character exclusive to the game Date A Live: Ren Dystopia. Ratatoskr is an organization created for the purpose of resolving the issues of Spirits and the spatial quakes through peaceful means. Commanded by Kotori Itsuka, it was created for her brother as he has the means to peacefully seal a Spirit's powers. Ratatoskr's command center is located upon their airship known as the Fraxinus, located above Tengu City. The headquarters for Ratatoskr is at an undisclosed location which houses the records for Ratatoskr as well as being the location for high-ranking members of Ratatoskr and the Rounds to operate from. Ky≈çhei Kannazuki : : :Ky≈çhei is the vice-commander of Ratatoskr crewing the Fraxinus, a ship located 15,000 meters above Tengu City. He shows masochistic qualities when receiving any type of physical punishment from Kotori. He displays psychological foresight in his defense of the Fraxinus which appears to be an ability known by Kotori to the point that she is dismissive of a physical attack upon the Fraxinus because of his presence. He is also the former captain of the AST, when Ry≈çko had just joined. Ky≈çhei kept the AST in line with unusual punishments whenever they stepped out of line; first timers had to cosplay for a day, second timers had to step on him on top of having to cosplay, whatever happened to third timers was so bad that Ry≈çko went pale thinking about it and refused to say a word about it. However Ky≈çhei was well-respected due to his skills with the Realizers. He left the AST to \\"find a suitable master to serve\\", and joined Ratatoskr, but left a wish to be reinstated in case he wanted to return. While he does have bizarre fetishes, his ability and brain is so great that he is able to do the job of a Command Realizer (which has the combined stress of 7 Realizers which would burn out most wizards,) but command the crew of the Fraxinus in battle, and manipulate the Yggd folium onto an enemy ship to act as a mine doing all three simultaneously. Although he still pales in comparison to Ellen's abilities considering how well she fought, especially considering the enormous power and stress of the special CR-unit, Goetia, she skillfully flew. Kyoji Kawagoe :, \\"Bad Marriage\\" : :Married and divorced five times, Kyoji has been given the title \\"Master of Love\\". One of several male assistants to Shido by giving a vote on the appropriate course of action Shido should take when acting. Masaomi Mikimoto :, \\"Boss\\" : :Masaomi is an incubus during the nighttime. One of several male assistants to Shido onboard the Fraxinus. His introductory phrase, Mahal kita is Filipino for I love you. Hinako Shiizaki :, \\"The Nail Knocker\\" : :Described as \\"bringing pain to every rival of her love\\" and \\"the woman who lives at 2am\\", Hinako is introduced with a voodoo doll. One of several female assistants to Shido onboard the Fraxinus. Munechika Nakatsugawa :, \\"The Dimension Breaker\\" : :Munechika is a man with a hundred wives. One of several male assistants to Shido onboard the Fraxinus. Kozue Minowa :, \\"Deep Love\\" : :Kozue is a woman whose sincere and earnest devotion was feared by the government. One of several female assistants to Shido onboard the Fraxinus. Elliott Baldwin Woodman : : :Elliott is an elderly man of higher than 50 years of age who is Ratatoskr's Machinery's founder as well as Kotori's benefactor. He is described as good natured and is the chairman of the Rounds. He seems blind since as all of the books within his library are written in Braille, yet after meeting Tohka in person he said \\"She really looked happy\\" rather than she sounded or she seemed happy. He receives respect from Kotori to the point that she wears her military uniform properly without her signature Chupa Chups lollipops. Seemingly, Elliott possesses authority over Kotori to the point in that being suggestive of appropriate action to take should the worse case happen after Shido manifested an Angel, Kotori replied that she would kill Shido. His secretary is Karen Nora Mathers, Ellen Mathers' (aka Adeptus 1 of DEM) younger sister. :In the past, Woodman founded DEM together with Westcott and Ellen. They summoned the First Spirit in the world, and unintentionally caused the first spatial quake to occur. However, Woodman claims that he adores Mio at first sight; realizing Westcott's disillusion goal causing Woodman to abandon DEM and formed Ratatoskr. At first, he was unwilling to resort to using Shido's power to seal the Spirits' mana inside his body for his goals, believing nothing good will come out of storing all that power in a single person. Yet, he was unsuccessful and theorized that a Sephira Crystal can only be extracted if all currently known Spirits have their mana stored into a single individual. Eventually, he was forced to use him as there was no other solution found. AST (Anti-Spirit Team) The Anti-Spirit Team is a special unit within the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force that is designed to suppress and kill the threat posed by Spirits. They utilize Combat Realizer units (CR Units) layered on top of combat wiring suits to enhance normal human capabilities while providing offensive and defensive combat capabilities. The CR Units are based upon equipment that utilizes technology recovered by humans after the original spatial quake that have been described as \\"magic through science\\". The CR Units of the AST have an operating area otherwise known as the operator's \\"personal territory\\" that can be expanded or contracted at the will of the operator, thus leading to a decrease or an increase in the territory's effective capability. In this personal territory, the impossible can occur thus leading to the description of \\"magic through science\\". Ry≈çko Kusakabe : : :Ry≈çko is of the Japan Ground Self Defense Force's Anti-Spirit Team who leads the young girls of the AST while being 27 herself. Mana Takamiya : : :A temporary Second Lieutenant of the AST, Mana works for the DEM Industries based out of England as a Wizard. Revealed to be the biological sister of Shido, she is unable to remember her time with Shido but possesses just a picture which was her only proof that she had a brother. As with Shido, she has blue hair and brown eyes, with her blue hair tied in a ponytail. She reunites with her brother who is shocked to meet her while she forms a rivalry with Kotori. Due to the procedure she underwent to strengthen her fighting power, she has less than 10 years to live, but was kept from knowing this truth about her body. After being defeated by Kurumi, Mana is hospitalized but is taken away by Ratatoskr in volume 5 whereupon she learns of this truth and defects to the organization in volume 6. :Truth is Mana and her brother Shido Itsuka, named Shinji Takamiya, and lived around 30 years ago. Mana was just an ordinary middle-school student living with Shinji, until one day, he brought over a half-naked girl, whom he named Mio, immediately surprising her. Soon Mio began staying with them as a relative of the family, and Mana taught her how to integrate herself with society. However, at some point, DEM abducted Mana. In DEM's captivity, it is theorized that they used complete experiments on Mana, granting her talented skills as a at the cost of halting her physical aging. Her memories were concealed for her incorporated into their organization. Mikie Okamine : : :Holding the rank of Private, Mikie is described as having brown eyes and hair, with her hair tied in pigtails. She is in Origami's and Shido's year but she skipped a grade, making her one year younger. Her age being close to Origami's leads her to have a strange attraction to Origami. Her dedication to Origami is shown by the fact that she was willing to resign from the AST when she thought Origami was going to have a disciplinary discharge. :She is also the protagonist of Date AST Like along with Origami. Mildred F. Fujimura : : :Holding the rank of Sergeant First Class, Mildred is described as a girl with blue eyes and blonde hair who wears glasses. She often goes by the nickname \\"Mily\\". Her age is close to Origami's thus leading her to have a strange attraction to Origami. She is a mechanic who occasionally gets delusional about others for her own personal fantasy. DEM Industries One of the largest corporations in the world, it is based out of England having originated out of a defense industry and it is the only known industry that is able to manufacture Realizer Units. The Realizer units equipped by the world's military, police forces, and especially the AST are all made by DEM Industries. They are economic rivals with Asgard Electronics, the company that supports Ratatoskr, with operatives who are able to utilize CR Units with experience exceeding that of special forces groups from different countries. The \\"DEM\\" within their name stands for Deus Ex Machina. They're marginally inferior to Ratatoskr in the development of aspects related to Realizer units due to advancing in various fields and oppose their policy of protecting and sheltering the Spirits, as according to them the only way to deal with the Spirits is by destroying them. As long as their goals are realized, killing hundreds of people in the process is an acceptable loss and not worth losing sleep over. Sir Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott : : :The main antagonist of Date A Live, who is the managing director of Deus Ex Machina Industries. He physically appears to be around 30 years old, and is a tall man with dark ash blond hair and sharp eyes. He seems to know more than he lets on, such as the knowledge of Tohka's Inverse state, as well as Shido's past. All of DEM's elite wizards refer to Westcott with -sama, fanatically loyal, and willing to do terrible acts at his behest. Westcott himself has shown little care, much less humanity, in his thinking as long as his goals are realized. Whether it is discussing ways to break Tohka's spirit through torture with the same manner and care one would discuss the weather, or the loss of life and DEM property when Tohka snapped, he lacked any sign or thought of remorse, despair, sorrow, or grief, but was pleased that she inverted as if nothing else mattered. :Westcott grew up in a town of mages who could use sorcery along with Woodman and Ellen. However, civilians who feared the power of mages scorched their village. This event caused a change in Westcott. This became the first step to the creation of DEM. The trio spent their youths learning everything they could about sorcery, leading to the foundation in creating a Spirit, a being of immense power born from the mana of the world which they could use to achieve their goal. Around the same time, Westcott was adopted by a rich couple, but, ended up dying in an accident, leaving their entire fortune to Westcott. Afterwards, he gained a desire to create a utopia, one with only mages living in it. Ellen Mira Mathers : : :Known as the world's strongest Wizard who works under Westcott as his secretary. She had previously worked for the AST at his request. She has vowed to never lose to any opponent, even agreeing that she may go so far as to commit the atrocity of destroying the world in the process. She is also Karen Nora Mathers' older sister. Whether Ellen's fanatical devotion to Westcott is sincere or imprinted on her is unknown, but was willing to cut off the hands of DEM board members who had voted against him. Also wants to kill Woodman for what she considers his betrayal. Like Westcott, she does not care about the lives of others (except for Westcott himself) except for how they can show some use in furthering his objectives. This is shown when she hopes Paddington and the Arbatel were completely destroyed when she loses contact with them rather than considering if she should go help. James A. Paddington : : :Second executive head for Colonel, he is the captain of the DEM Industries' 500 meter airship Arbatel. He is a middle-aged man with a beard. Has an arrogant personality and more concerned with saving his career when things went south rather than his crew's lives or maintaining secrecy. While held in captivity after the island incident by Ratatoskr, Westcott terminated him after using him to communicate with him. Jessica Bailey : : :Long red haired woman and is the third strongest DEM wizard. Like the other DEM wizards she's concerned with receiving Westcott's favor and completing his orders first, and personal morals a distant second. Jessica was the leader of the DEM wizards sent to the AST after the island incident to \\"help out\\" with the authority to act on their own in order to accomplish Westcott's mission of finding and capturing Shido and Tohka at the first opportunity shown. Arrogantly considers herself and the other DEM wizards helping the AST as elites helping out immature amateurs only until they complete their own secret mission. She also is extremely jealous of Ellen and Mana being more powerful and therefore closer to Westcott. After losing to Mana in their first battle Jessica somehow got her powers severely charged up allowing her to use the , a combat version of the test type for their second battle. However, this would burn her out in hours and not years overwhelming her mentality causing her to go berserk. So in her attempts to kill Mana during their second battle Jessica was completely ignoring any damage she dealt to her own comrades and the surrounding area. When Jessica was approaching her limit Mana dealt her a terminal blow, killing her. Her last words were wondering if Westcott would finally notice her. Raizen High School is a high school located in Tenguu City within the Kantou region where Shido and other major characters attend. Having been built on the disaster area that affected Japan from the spatial quake thirty years ago, the school is installed with an underground bunker for whenever there is a spatial quake in the area. Hiroto Tonomachi : : :Shido's classmate. In the anime, he has a 2D girlfriend who is actually a character from , Date A Live's in-universe visual novel. Tamae Okamine : : :Homeroom teacher for Shido's class, she is called Tama-chan by her students. As she is 29 years old and still single, she is very anxious to get married. The Trio ;, , & : :Shido's classmates. They always seen together and are friends with Tohka, supporting her in her efforts to become Shido's girlfriend, while reprimanding him upon seeing him with other girls.

Due to its realistic plot, the painting was used in the Soviet school curriculum as a topic for writing an essay. The painting was well known to the Soviet public.  Subject  In the painting we see a family that meets a boy who came home from school with the failing grade D. The boy looks like a loser, his clothes are unbuttoned, with wrinkled coat, pants, black shoes - a casual look. In his right hand he holds a tied bag that seems to have served as a ball and a sled to its master, with old skates sticking out. His blond hair is rumpled, his protruding ears are red, ruddy from skating in the cold air, which does not tally at all with his artificially disappointed face. He sighs, his whole appearance is an act of faking \\"genuine\\" sadness because of the failing grade. The boy is joyfully greeted by a dog, it is very fond of the boy, as if it asks: \\"Come and play with me.\\" On the right side, his mother sits down, as if pausing her housework. Seeing his sad but flushed from the cold face, she realized that the boy played plenty enough on the street and he is not really worried about received low marks. The mother is upset and tired, she realizes that her son is a slacker. The woman does not know how to influence her lazy son, she drops her hands. Next to the mother is the younger brother on his bike, who laughs at the older brother, knowing full well what is going on. At the dinner table, the older sister is doing homework. She stood up, looking reproachfully at her sloppy brother. Her posture, the turn of her head, and the bright red scarf of a Communist \\"Pioneer\\" (like a Soviet Eagle Scout), all testify that she does not approve of the behavior of this loser. Her figure is prominently displayed as a dark silhouette in a bright doorway. The window behind her creates a dual lighting pattern and symbolizes her own bright future. The tortured reaction of the people is in stark contrast with the sincere joy of the animal, which exaggerates the importance of something as trivial as a school grade.

Cospin, is the first fungal trypsin inhibitor with a determined 3D structure, it utilizes a different loop for trypsin inhibition compared to other beta-trefoil inhibitors.Sasakawa H., Yoshinaga S., Kojima S., Tamura A. (2002): Structure of POIA1, a homologous protein to the propeptide of subtilisin. Implication for protein foldability and the function as an intramolecular chaperone. J. Mol. Biol. 317, 159‚Äì167. Substrate binding‚Äúcospin is a classic inhibitor that binds to the active site in a substrate-like manner and forms a tight and stable complex with trypsin.‚Äù Cospin biotoxicity is not lethal to amoeba A.castellanii, nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and two true fly species. The toxicity caused developmental delay in both pupae and flies. Application Cospin plays a defensive role against predators and parasites. Cospin toxicity targets specifically fruit fly D. melanogaster. Cospin represents one type of fungal protein mediated defence against fungivorous insects. Cospin a serine protease inhibitor can be of use in various applications ranging from pest management, crop protection to drug development, design for therapeutics, and basic medical research.

This chapter contains the prescript, thanksgiving and encouragement for the recipients. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 12 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 30 (3rd century) *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant: verses 1‚Äì3, 10‚Äì11) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) Prescript (1:1‚Äì2) As common in the letters of ancient Mediterranean, this epistle begins with a prescript comprising the names of the senders (Paul, Silvanus and Timothy), the addressees (the ekklƒìsia/church of the Thessalonians) and a brief greeting, which is identical to the prescript in 1 Thessalonians 1:1. Verse 1 : Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, :: To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: NKJV Verse 2 :Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. NKJV Thanksgiving and Encouragement (1:3-12) Paul usually includes a thanksgiving after the prescript in his epistles (except in Galatians), where he mentions the good qualities of the recipients. Verse 7 :and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, NKJV * \\"You who are troubled, rest with us\\": For those persecuted for the sake of righteousness, \\"rest\\" is offered as a relaxation, at least for a while, as the churches in Judea, Samaria and Galilee had, after a wave of persecution since the death of Stephen () and as the Christians had during the destruction of Jerusalem. Although the time of destruction was a day of vengeance for the unbelieving Jews, it gives a relief to the believers from their Jewish persecutors. It could also refer to a rest to all eternity for the believers who are in the grave at the Lord's coming, when they rest from all their works, are delivered from sin, Satan's temptations, and persecutions of men (), and to have joy together with the apostles of Jesus Christ and other believers, to obtain 'heavenly glory, rest, and felicity', and have the same crown of glory. * \\"When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven\\": Jesus Christ has been hidden, since a cloud received him up to heaven out of the sight of the apostles, where he remains until the end of all things, and has not been seen with corporeal eyes by the people on earth since then, except by a very few, such as Stephen and Paul who have only seen him with an eye of faith. Jesus will be revealed at his second coming, and every eye shall see him, descending from heaven. * \\"His mighty angels\\": will add to the glory, majesty, and solemnity of Jesus' appearance. The words from the original text may be rendered, \\"with the angels of his power\\", as in the Latin Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopian versions. The Syriac version reads, \\"with the power of his angels\\". They are called his angels, because he created them, and becomes the object of their worship, as he is the Lord of them, and they are ministering spirits to him and his people.

NKJV * \\"Not to be soon shaken in mind\\" (KJV: \\"That ye be not soon shaken in mind\\"; Vulgate Latin version: \\"from your mind or sense\\"; the Arabic version: \\"from the solidity of sense\\"): , so They should not become like 'a wave of the sea, tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine', or shifted away from what they had embraced as articles of faith into their minds and become their sense and judgment, as well as the hope or fundamental article of the Gospel; especially about Christ's second coming, that they should not be easily swayed away from it (). * \\"Troubled\\": or thrown into surprise and consternation, although the second coming of Christ will not be as terrible to the believers as to sinners, yet it has the sense of awfulness, solemness, and full of concern, so if not told beforehand it might be shocking. * \\"By spirit\\": by prophetic pretensions to a revelation from the Spirit, giving a fix time of Christ's coming, which should not be listened nor paid attention to, because this second coming will be 'as a thief in the night'. * \\"By word\\": by arguments or reason using probability or enticing words of wisdom using astronomical or arithmetical calculations, or by pretensions as if a word or tradition of Christ or his apostles was received \\"viva voce\\" (by word of mouth) from any of them. * \\"By letter, as if from us\\": The forging of apostles' letter and counterfeiting their writings began very early, as spurious epistles of the Apostle Paul were spread out, which obliged him to take a method to ensure his genuine letters (; ). Also, his former epistle contains some things concerning Christ's coming, which could be either misrepresented, or not understood, that it may be interpreted as if the coming would happen while he and others were still alive and on the spot. Therefore, Paul would not want them to pay attention to any enthusiastic spirits, or to any plausible reasoning of men, or oral traditions or to any epistles in his name, or in the name of any of the apostles. * \\"As though the day of Christ had come\\": \\"had come\\" (NKJV) or \\"is at hand\\" (KJV) or \\"is at this instant just now coming on\\", as if it would be within a certain year, in a certain month, and on a certain day. The Alexandrian version, and some others, including the Vulgate Latin version, read, \\"the day of the Lord\\"; the Syriac and Ethiopian versions read, \\"the day of our Lord\\". Paul would not want them to be tempted to disbelieve or be indifferent about the second coming, because if it did not come true, the people might be persuaded to conclude that there was nothing true in the Christian doctrine. Moreover, the notion of a speedy coming of Christ may cause the disorderly and idle persons among them to be in laziness and negligence. Therefore, in this and the next verse, Paul dissuades them from absorbing such a tenet. Even though Christ's coming is sometimes said to be drawing nigh, or to be quickly, yet not at that instant, because such expressions are used with respect to God, for whom 1000 years are as 1 day, and 1 day as 1000 years; and because the times of Gospel or the Messiah, are the last days until the second coming of Christ, mainly used to keep up the faith and expectation of the saints.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible ‚Äì 2 Thessalonians 2:2 Encouragement to Persevere (2:13‚Äì17) This second thanksgiving is for the establishment of the church by God as a privileged group in the world, to obtain the exalted honor (Greek: doxa) of Jesus Christ.

Web. 26 Jan. 2015. . Intercalation of a metallo- intercalator creates less strain in the DNA duplex than insertion; metallo- insertors induce an untwist of the double helix and an opening of the phosphate backbone while metallo-intercalators marginally increase the rise and width of the major groove. Intercalation of metal compounds between DNA base pairs effectively stabilizes the double helix, increasing the melting temperature of the DNA duplex. Binding of metallo-intercalators to DNA is reversible and depends on the properties of the intercalating molecule. Metallo-intercalators with different metal centers, oxidation states, coordination geometries, and overall sizes will exhibit varying ‚Äúdepths of insertion‚Äù. For example, square planar complexes penetrate deeper into the DNA base pairs than octahedral or tetrahedral complexes do. Also, positive charges on the metallo-intercalator strengthen DNA-binding because of electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone.  Therapeutic applications  Figure 3: The wide structure of metallo-intercalators containing the ligand 5,6-chrysenequinone diimine (chrysi) can be used in anticancer therapeutics to identify mismatched DNA base pairs. Metallo- intercalators have a variety of potential therapeutic applications as a result of their structural diversity and universal photooxidative properties. One possible therapeutic application of metallo-intercalators is to combat cancerous tumor cells within the body by targeting specific mismatched DNA base pairs; the ability to modify the ligands bound to the metal center allows for a high degree of specificity in the binding interactions between the metallo-intercalator and the DNA sequence. For example, the ligand 5,6-chrysenequinone diimine (chrysi) and its analogues are designed to be too wide to fit inside the normal span of the base pairs of B-DNA, causing it to bind instead to the wider portions of the helix at destabilized sites of mismatched bases. After intercalation, the sample can be photoactivated by absorbing energy during irradiation with short wavelength light. This activation causes the metallo-intercalator's photooxidative properties to induce a cleavage of the sugar phosphate backbone at the site of mismatch through a radical mechanism. Even in the absence of irradiation, the interactions between the metallo-intercalator and DNA can substantially decrease the proliferation of cells containing DNA with mismatched base pairs.

The novel was published by Solaris Books in February 2015. Moreno- Garcia stated that she was inspired to write the novel based on her parents, who both worked at a radio station. Plot In 2009, Mercedes \\"Meche\\" Vega returns to Mexico City to attend the funeral of her DJ father. While there she reminisces about her life in the city in 1988 when she was fifteen and how she accidentally discovered, along with her best friends Sebastian and Daniela, that she could perform spells by listening to songs. Meche and Sebastian cast spells in order to gain money to draw the attention of their respective crushes: Constantino and Isadora, two of their popular, rich and attractive classmates. While Isadora slowly warms to Sebastian, Constantino continues to mostly ignore Meche, causing her to look for a record she will be able to use to cast a spell to make Constantino fall in love with her. At her father's suggestion she looks for a copy of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" which feels burning hot to her and thus will be potent enough to cast the spell. When she reveals her plan to Sebastian saying that a spell is the only way she could look attractive, Sebastian tells Meche she is pretty and kisses her causing Meche to realize she has a crush on him. After months of looking Meche finds her copy of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\"; however by this point she intends to use it to reunite her parents who are looking to divorce. Thinking that Meche still intends to use it on Constantino, Sebastian steals the record from her room, along with her copy of Duncan Dhu which Meche uses as her object of power to make herself more potent. He uses the album on \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" on Isadora causing her to fall in love with him and using up all its power so that it is useless to Meche. In revenge Meche bullies Daniela into hexing Sebastian. Meche intends for Sebastian to fall off his bike and injure himself, however she accidentally casts a death spell which her grandmother, Dolores, senses and manages to stop, causing herself to have a stroke in the process. Meche threatens Daniela and Sebastian into reuniting with her so that she can heal her grandmother, but instead of doing her bidding Sebastian breaks her Duncan Dhu album causing Meche to lose her ability to cast spells. Heartbroken she goes to her father's house where he refuses to take her in and confesses he stole the money for her education and lost it in a poor investment. Meche then decides to leave and move in with her aunt in Monterrey. Back in 2009, against her wishes, Sebastian attends Meche's father's novena and visits her while she is cleaning his apartment. She learns that he was briefly married to Isadora and even lived in Monterrey for a while but, despite being successful, never went to Europe the way he wanted to as a teenager. Sebastian tells Meche that he was, and still is, in love with her and finally gives her his objects of power, which were the sneakers he wore as a teenager. Meche is determined to leave him behind and return to Oslo where she now lives, but instead goes back to his apartment and asks if they can begin again, finally telling him that she loves him in Norwegian. Reception The novel received generally positive reviews upon publication. In April 2015 it was named one of the Best Science Fiction Novels of the Month in The Guardian.

The league was the work of Pope Celestine III and his two papal legates: Pandulf, cardinal priest of Santi Apostoli, and Bernard, cardinal priest of San Pietro in Vincoli. It was directed against the Holy Roman Emperor in alliance with the papacy. Its members swore not to make any alliances without papal approval, nor to make any peace or truce \\"with any emperor, king, prince, duke or margrave\\" without the approval of the rectors of the league. The original signatories were the communes of Lucca, Florence and Siena, the people living under the castles of Prato and San Miniato, and the bishopric of Volterra. The city of Arezzo joined on 2 December; Pisa refused and was placed under interdict by Celestine. The real objective of the league was to secure for its members control of their respective regions. War was to be made on any city, town, count or bishop who refused to join the league when asked to do so, yet none were allowed to join without recognising their \\"legitimate\\" overlords, which in practice usually meant recognising one of the communes as lord. An exception was made for Poggibonsi, since there were many claims on it. Shortly after the election of 1198, the new pope, Innocent III, condemned the Tuscan League as a dishonorable interference in the affairs of Tuscany, which he now claimed‚Äîon the basis of the Liber censuum (1192)‚Äîbelonged entirely to the temporal jurisdiction of the Roman church. Celestine had not openly claimed authority in imperial or ducal Tuscany, but Innocent was prepared to extend papal claims to cover all of Tuscany. (The Tuscan duchy corresponded to old \\"Lombard\\" Tuscany, while papal Tuscany was \\"Roman\\", or suburbicarian, Tuscany‚Äîa distinction going back to the eighth century.) He thus revoked the interdict on Pisa and persuaded Viterbo and Perugia not to join. He sent Pandulf and Bernard back to try to negotiate the submission of the Tuscan cities and barons to him. Seven months of negotiations failed and Innocent was forced to accept the Tuscan League, even threatening Pisa with a renewed interdict.

Born into a theatrical family in Mexico City, she first wanted to be an actress but began writing when she was 16. All of her plays have been staged and most have been published both in Mexico and abroad. Her work has been translated into multiple languages and is regularly invited to events such as the HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the Miami International Book Fair, the Festival Internacional del Libro in Guadalajara and at The Banff Center and the Rockfeller Foundation. In 2009, she was named an ‚Äúartistic creator‚Äù with Mexico‚Äôs Sistema Nacional de Creadores. Life Escalante was born in Mexico City in 1964. She is the granddaughter of director and producer Alvaro Custodio, who founded the Teatro Cl√°sico de M√©xico in the 1960s. Because of her family‚Äôs theatrical background, she wanted to become an actress when she was very young, but was told that she did not have the talent for this. However, her upbringing in the upper-class Condesa neighborhood in Condesa shaped her perspective on human relations, having contact with artists and intellectuals and spend time at the movies with the children of Alejandro Jodorowsky. However, despite this and the fact that she has written screenplays, she goes to the movies today infrequently. At age 16 she began to write stories and novels and created her first play at that time. She entered a class taught by Hugo Arg√ºelles and at the same time studied directing with Ludwick Margules. She then received a diploma from the Escuela de Escritores. She also took workshops with Jos√© Luis Alonso de Santos, William Layton and Juan Jos√© Gurrola. She went to Spain to study her bachelors at the Real Escuela Superior de Arte Dram√°tico (RESAD), majoring in writing and criticism, receiving scholarships from FONCA, the Sistema Nacional de Creadores (J√≥venes Creadores) and the Spanish Ministry of Culture and Science. Since then she has combined literature theory can criticism with her creative work. Escalante has two children and her house in Mexico City is filled with momentos from her career and travels, such as photos of artists and posters from her plays. When asked to describe herself she replied: > How am I? I am obsessed with ideas, with themes, with people: once I have > begun with an obsession, I go where it takes me. I am very intense, too. I > have taken many risks and I don't care. A sense of humor in myself and in > others is important to me. I like food greatly. I don‚Äôt like people who do > not appreciate eating.

Career Escalante says she is a slow writer and says only in the later career has she become more productive. However, almost all of her work has been published, and all of her plays have been staged. Her works have been translated into English, French, German, Greek, Dutch, Italian and Portuguese and have been staged in New York, Washington, Ohio, Miami, Montreal, Ottawa, Banff, Paris, Lyon, Cannes, Venice, Rome, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Udine, Athens, Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile and Madrid. In Mexico, her work has been directed by the likes of Mauricio Garc√≠a Lozano and Francisco Franco. Escalante worked with the Nouveau Th√©√¢tre du 8 theater company in Lyon, France from 2011 to 2013 to produce a series of four plays. The playwright has worked on various publications researched theatrical production and theory. She wrote a theater column for the newspaper Reforma from 2000 to 2006 and has written for publications associated with RESAD and UNAM. Escalante has participated in various workshops in writing and theatrical production and gives classes in dramatic literature in various institutions. She runs a theater workshop open to all ages, with one of her students, Pablo Iv√°n Garc√≠a, winning the Mexicali Fine Arts Prize in 2010, for his play Micro dermo abrasi√≥n. In 2009-2012 period, Escalante was named an ‚ÄúArtistic Creator‚Äù of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores. She has been invited on various occasions to the Pen Voices Festival in New York. Her works have been presented at HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the Miami International Book Fair, the Festival Internacional del Libro in Guadalajara, The Banff Center and at the Rockfeller Foundation. Artistry While Escalante has written movie and television scripts including screenplays with Alfonso Arau and Rafael Montero, she has focused her career mostly on writing plays. Much of Escalante‚Äôs work is based on classic myths and stories from the Classical Greece, (especially those of Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides) either reinterpreting them or working with characters and other elements, especially those she considers to be relevant to contemporary life. Female characters such as Phaedra, Electra, Andromache, Salome and Lilith are often the focus. In addition to works based on ancient literature, Escalante has also created works dealing with the creative struggles of more modern writers, such as Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Colette, Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. She even wrote one about painter Frida Kahlo. In general Escalante‚Äôs works are tragedies which touch on love, passion and sexuality and the conflicts they generate. However, she does add touches of humor. Plays of this type include Fedra y otras griegas (2002), Colette (2005), Las relaciones (sexuales) de Shakespeare (y Marlowe) (2012) and Tennessee en cuerpo y alma (2012) . She believes it is inevitable to have plays be at least somewhat autobiographical. Works *1994. Vac√≠o Azul, published in the anthology Hacerle el teatro by Plaza y Valdez *1996.

Benson, was a Nigerian lawyer who became one of the most prominent Yoruba politicians in the period leading up to Nigerian independence in 1960. He served as the Minister of Information, Broadcasting and Culture in the first post-independence government. Benson was imprisoned for several months after the first military coup of 1966. He returned to practice as a barrister, and was recognised as a prominent Yoruba chief. Early years Theophilus Owolabi Shobowale Benson was born on 23 July 1917 in Ikorodu, Lagos into an aristocratic family. He was of Yoruba origin. His younger brother was the future musician Bobby Benson. He attended the CMS Grammar School, Lagos. When he was 20 he joined the customs service. In 1943 he moved to London, where he studied law at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1947. That year he returned to Nigeria and joined the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC). He supported his younger brother, Bobby, who was running a touring theatrical group. He thought the group should have an orchestra, and in 1948 bought the band-set popularly called the \\"Jam- Session Orchestra\\". He is also a grand uncle of Babajimi Benson who is a member of Nigeria‚Äôs Federal House of Representatives. Pre-independence politics In 1950 Benson was elected to the Lagos Town Council, and later became the Deputy Mayor of Lagos. Benson owed his political success to the support of the cosmopolitan electorate of Lagos. Benson's Lagos constituency was one in which Ibos formed the largest ethnic group, but in the pre- independence period he won election easily despite being Yoruba since the NCNC was broadly supported. In the 1951 election Benson was chosen as one of the NCNC candidates for the five Lagos seats in the Western House of Assembly, the others being Nnamdi Azikiwe, Adeleke Adedoyin, A. B. Olorunnimbe and the trade unionist H. P. Adebola. The five candidates easily defeated their opponents from the Action Group. Benson became a national officer in the NCNC. Benson was a participant in the constitutional conferences in London in 1953, 1957, 1958 and 1960 that led up to Nigeria's independence in 1960. He was elected to various positions on the NCNC platform between 1950 and 1959. In 1954‚Äì55 Benson was chairman of the Western Regional Organization Committee. In May 1957 he was National Financial Secretary of the NCNC. He accompanied Nnamdi Azikiwe, Premier of Eastern Nigeria and President of the NCNC, to London for the Nigeria Constitutional Conference at Lancaster House. In 1958 he was National Financial Secretary and a member of the NCNC Strategic Committee. He was also NCNC Chief Whip in the House of Representatives and Chairman of the Lagos branch. In 1959 he was Chairman of the Western Working Committee, having been elected to replace Salami Agbaje, and mediated in a dispute between the factions of Adeoye Adisa and Agbaje in the NCNC. He mostly ruled in favour of the Agbaje faction, resulting in the Adisa faction leaving the NCNC and contesting the elections independently. Benson was re-elected to the House of representatives in the 1959 federal election. His victory was challenged on the basis that he had not resigned from his office under the Crown before running for election. The Lagos High Court nullified the election on this basis, but the Federal Supreme Court reversed the decision on appeal. The Ministry of Information was created in 1959, with Benson as first minister. Post-independence Benson (centre) during a visit to Berlin in June 1963 Benson remained a federal minister in the first government after independence (1 October 1960). The Ministry of Information published the Nigerian Handbook and the Nigerian Magazine, publications that gave information about the country after independence. Benson was the driving force behind establishing the Voice of Nigeria (VON). Radio and television were used to communicate the government's message that the gains of independence should be consolidated and the nation unified, rising above ethnic divisions. K. O. Mbadiwe, Minister of Aviation from March 1964 to March 1965, put on a show he called \\"Operation Fantastic\\" to celebrate the inauguration of flights from Lagos to New York in October 1964. He took a troupe of dancers and drummers on the first flight. They performed at various venues in the US with great success. This proved a controversial decision. Benson criticised the show since his ministry should handle the export of Nigerian culture. It was not until 1972 that the affair was settled. In the early 1960s the Western NCNC was torn between allying with the United Progressive Party (UPP) or the Action Group. The essence of the question was whether Yorubas should align with Hausas or Ibos. Inter-ethnic tensions continued to build. In early 1964 the newspapers were full of charges against political leaders of various ethnic backgrounds saying they were promoting dominance of their ethnic group. Benson, the leading Yoruba politician, Vice-President of the NCNC and Minister of Information, was attacked on these grounds by the Igbo State Union. In the run-up to the 1964 election the local NCNC in Lagos overrode Benson's objections and chose its four candidates by election in constituency caucuses. An Igbo candidate easily defeated Benson, and the party rejected Benson's appeal. He resigned from the NCNC to run as an independent. After taking control of the Nigerian Government earlier in January 1966, the military decreed the arrest, in March 1966 for \\"state security\\" reasons, 30 politicians from the south. Benson, K. O. Mbadiwe and M. N. Ugochuku were detained at Alagbon, then transferred to the Ikoyi prison. At first the three men were held in one room with no toilet, and were not allowed visitors. Later General Ironsi allowed improvements in the prisoners' detention conditions. They were released on 2 August 1966, four days after the second military coup. As a lawyer, Benson became a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). He became a prominent Yoruba chief; although a native of Ikorodu, he held the chieftaincy title of the Baba Oba of Lagos. In a 1990 interview Benson spoke in favour of leadership by rotation for the State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs. T.O.S. Benson died on 13 February 2008 at the age of 90 at his home in Ikoyi, Lagos.

In 1990, Joseph was successful in working with the Government of Canada to pass a law that would protect Jewish women in need of a get. She currently serves as Professor of Religion at Concordia University and Associate Director of the University's Azrieli Institute of Israel Studies. Biography Joseph was born in Brooklyn to Moishe (Murray) Baumel and Madeline (n√©e Kohn). Moishe was a salesman who had emigrated to the United States as a child, and Madeline was a typist-secretary who arrived in the United States as an infant. Both sides of Joseph's family were heavily engaged in Jewish occupations. In 1965, she married Rabbi Howard Joseph who, five years later, became the leader of Montreal's Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. She received a B.A. from Brooklyn College in 1966, an M.A. from the City University of New York in 1968, and a Ph.D in religion from Concordia University in 1995. Her doctoral dissertation focused on the legal decisions of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein concerning the separate spheres for women in the Jewish community. The dissertation was nominated for a Governor General's Gold Medal award for excellence. Joseph has published widely in scholarly books and journals as an expert in Jewish feminist thought. She serves on the editorial board of Women in Judaism, on the advisory board of the Journal of Religion and Culture, on the advisory council of JOFA, and on the international board of the Jewish Women's Archive. In 1995, she received the Leo Wasserman Prize for the best article published in American Jewish History that year for \\"Jewish Education for Women: Rabbi Moshe Feinstein‚Äôs Map of America\\" (vol. 83, no. 2, 205‚Äì222).

She is a member of the advisory board of Kol ha-Isha: A Feminist House of Study in Jerusalem, sponsored by the Conservative movement. Joseph has been particularly active in the issue of agunot, women denied divorce. As a founding member of the Canadian Coalition of Jewish Women for the Get, she successfully worked with the Jewish community and the Canadian Federal Government to pass a law in 1990 (Divorce Act, ch.18, 21.1) that would protect Jewish women in difficult divorce situations and aid them in their pursuit of a Jewish divorce. Following the Canadian success, Joseph helped form the International Coalition for Agunah Rights, an international coalition of women's groups advocating for agunot. Honours and awards Joseph won the Leo Wasserman Prize from the American Jewish Historical Society for the best article of 1995 in the journal American Jewish History. She was recognized by the National Council of Jewish Women (Montreal chapter), which chose her as its Woman of Distinction in 1998; by the Montreal Jewish community, which presented her with the Jacob Zipper Education Award in 2000; and by Jewish Women International, from which she received the Leading Light, Woman of the Year Award in 2002.

The depot was built in 1913 as a replacement for Cullman's original station. Cullman's founder, John G. Cullmann, gave money to the city upon his death in 1895 to lower the Louisville and Nashville Railroad tracks through town, in order to reduce noise and pollution. The plan was not enacted until 1911, when the L&N; laid double tracks through the town, necessitating the construction of a new depot. See also: The depot served passengers until 1968, and was used for maintenance storage by new owners CSX until it was sold to the city in 1990. It was restored and now houses offices for the local United Way chapter. The depot is built in Mission Revival style, unique among otherwise standard and less stylized L&N; depot designs. The center section of the three-bay building is separated by two piers which rise above the parapet. The piers have shallow pyramidal tops, and are decorated with recessed panels and horizontal banding. In the central bay lies the main entrance, covered by a hipped roof portico which is supported by heavy square columns and brackets. The parapet is arched in each bay of the fa√ßade, and in the center bay of the rear, track-facing side. Each bay features 2 one-over-one sash windows with single-light transoms. The north end of the building has a set of carriage doors, originally leading to the baggage area, while the south end has a covered porch that leads to the tracks.

The library was built in 1902 to house the city's library program, which began in 1870. Chicago architects Patton & Miller designed the Classical Revival building. The building still houses the city's public library and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Jacksonville began its library program in 1870, but the library did not have a permanent home for its first three decades. The original program was a members-only program based out of the county courthouse. A free reading room opened in 1874, and the City of Jacksonville took control of the library in 1881; at this time, it was relocated to the city's YMCA. The library moved to a larger space in a building on South Main Street in 1897, but by this point it was growing fast enough to need a separate building. Lawyer L. O. Vaught petitioned Andrew Carnegie for a donation to build a library in 1901; the Carnegie Foundation gave the city $40,000 for a building. The library was built in 1902 and opened to the public in February of the following year. The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 24, 2000. The building was expanded in the 1990s and continues to house the city's library. Architecture Chicago architects Patton & Miller, who designed over 80 library buildings, designed the library. The two-story library has a Classical Revival design and a cross- shaped plan, the preferred library plan of Carnegie's secretary James Bertram. A portico supported by four Corinthian columns covers the front entrance; the front door features glass sidelights and transoms. A dentillated and bracketed pediment tops the entrance, and a dentillated cornice runs along the library's roof line. Double pilasters mark each corner of the building.

Zeppa took up an assignment for two years. Initially she started writing a fiction based on her experience there, but she was suggested to write it in memoir form and she took the advice. The book was first published in 1999. The title of the book is derived from an expression of thankfulness in the Bhutanese language which means \\"I am thankful to you beyond the earth and sky\\". Sky and Earth was on the Maclean's bestseller list.  Content  Zeppa dedicates the book to her grandfather Patrick Raymond Zeppa and her grandmother Florence Alize Zeppa, who were immigrants from Poland settled in Canada. It is her first book on her experiences of working as a lecturer in English in a school in Bhutan, the tantric Buddhist kingdom in eastern Himalayas. She provides extensive knowledge about the country which till the early 1960s was not even connected by road links and was dependent only on barter trade, and its people were ruled by a king. The book is divided into six chapters (Arrival, Entrance, Movement Order, Peak of Higher Learning, Involvement and Love) followed by a postscript. In the first chapter, Arrival, she narrates about her initial education in Toronto, Canada under the care of her paternal grandparents, as her parents had separated when she was two years old; her decision not to pursue a doctoral degree in English but take up a job as an English lecturer on a two-year assignment in a school in Bhutan. in response to an ad posted by the World University Service of Canada; her grandfather's skepticism about her taking up this assignment in an alien land, her departure from Canada and arriving at the Paro Airport in Bhutan after a bumpy air journey. In the subsequent chapters she narrates about the Himalayan topography of the isolated valleys, the Bhutanese people, history of Buddhism in the country, the religious affiliation of the people to the Bon religion of shamanistic beliefs, their social customs, etiquette, food habits, poor hygienic conditions, her posting in the Sherubtse College near Trashigang in eastern Bhutan, her love life and so forth. She explains about Buddha and his teachings. She also explains the experiences of fellow teachers from foreign countries with humorous epithets like \\"night-hunting\\" (furtive entry into a girl's house in the night), \\"vomit-comet\\" (journey in a bus which stinks), \\"from scabies to rabies\\" (health conditions) and \\"Dysentery Danishes\\" (about the type of food they get). She gives vivid account of facts and events that happened during her teaching assignment at the Sherubtse College, located in Kanglung village near Trashigang; this college, the first in Bhutan, had been established by the Jesuit priest Father William Mackey in the 1970s.  Reception  The book received mainly positive reviews. According to Steve Waters, \\"the book Beyond the Sky and the Earth is much more than a travel book. It is an effort to bring out her experience in Bhutan working as a teacher in the land of blind beliefs in ghosts and bad omens and supernatural forces\\". Waters notes that \\"Zeppa, with her literary talent, presents her personal experience in Bhutan in a prose that brings out the spiritual atmosphere of devotees turning the Buddhist prayer wheels in a pervading religious setting of burning of incense and lighted yak-butter lamps\\". Waters also comments that Zeppa's language \\"has a rhythm with hymns chanted by the monks and brings out the ethos of the karma theory of the country\\". Laurie Park, in the review published in the \\"Story Circle Book Reviews\\", has observed that Zeppa's narration, well presented, is not only absorbing but also amusing. Park, tracing Zeppa's background of living in Canada, states that the description of her early stages of stay in Bhutan with misgivings is a contrast to her later narration of her personal involvement with the culture of the country. Laurie also observes that Zeppa's writings juxtaposing her previous life to her acquired experience in mystic Bhutan resonates with readers perceptions after reading the book. According to Laurie, she brings out her views on the political uncertainty in the country, which was a contrast to her own cultural upbringing, and then her own personal association followed by conversion to Buddhism and its practices. Kirkus Reviews found the book alluring and Zeppa's ardor for Bhutan and its people very miasmic and provides insight of her involvement with the exciting Bhutanese culture. In the Publishers Weekly review, it was written‚Äî > Zeppa's telling of her clumsy attempts to adapt rings with sincerity and > inspires sincerity.... {Her} lucid descriptions of the craggy terrain and > hones respect for the daily struggles of the natives bring the tiny land to > life in a way that is reverent but real. A lively tale. Awards Zeppa's book has been translated into seven languages. It has been published in ten countries. In 1999, she was the recipient of the Banff Mountain Book Festival Award for her book.

The low power, low bit rate and intended use distinguish this type of network from a wireless WAN that is designed to connect users or businesses, and carry more data, using more power. The LPWAN data rate ranges from 0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s per channel.Ferran Adelantado, Xavier Vilajosana, Pere Tuset-Peiro, Borja Martinez, Joan Meli√†-Segu√≠ and Thomas Watteyne. Understanding the Limits of LoRaWAN (January 2017). A LPWAN may be used to create a private wireless sensor network, but may also be a service or infrastructure offered by a third party, allowing the owners of sensors to deploy them in the field without investing in gateway technology.  Technology attributes  # Long range: The operating range of LPWAN technology varies from a few kilometers in urban areas to over 10 km in rural settings. It can also enable effective data communication in previously infeasible indoor and underground locations. # Low power: Optimized for power consumption, LPWAN transceivers can run on small, inexpensive batteries for up to 20 years # Low cost: LPWAN's simplified, lightweight protocols reduce complexity in hardware design and lower device costs. Its long range combined with a star topology reduce expensive infrastructure requirements, and the use of license-free or licensed bands reduce network costs. Platforms and technologies There are a number of competing standards and vendors in the LPWAN space, the most prominent of which include: * DASH7, a low latency, bi-directional firmware standard that operates over multiple LPWAN radio technologies including LoRa. * Chirp spread spectrum based * Sigfox, UNB-based technology and French company. * LoRa is a proprietary, chirp spread spectrum (CSS) radio modulation technology for LPWAN used by LoRaWAN, Haystack Technologies, and Symphony Link. * MIoTy, implementing Telegram Splitting technology. * Weightless is an open standard, narrowband technology for LPWAN used by Ubiik *Wize is an open and royalty free standard for LPWAN derived from the European Standard Wireless Mbus.

The Episcopal Church supported a separate African American religious life during the 19th century and early 20th century. Parishes established by African American communicants during this period of time were chartered as a Colored Episcopal Mission. Parish status was awarded when the mission became financially independent from the diocese. It was common for these missions to have a long duration as a mission before reaching parish status. The first established Colored Episcopal Mission is St. Thomas Episcopal in Philadelphia, PA. It was established in 1794.

Sehnbruch is known for her work on conceptualising and measuring the quality of employment, particularly in developing countries. Her research subjects include quality of employment, multidimensional indicators, Latin American labour markets, labour relations, Chilean politics and public policy.  Research  Sehnbruch has consistently worked on the subject of the quality of employment. Her work argues that employment conditions such as income levels, job stability, occupational status, social security contributions, and access to quality vocational training are extremely important to an individual's capabilities and well-being. Still, these conditions are often neglected by labour market experts and policy makers, who tend to focus mostly on the quantity of available jobs.Sehnbruch. 2006. The Chilean Labor Market: A Key to Understanding Latin American Labor Markets. New York and Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. \\\\- Sehnbruch et al. 2015. \\"Human Development and Decent Work: Why somo Concepts Succeed and Others Fail to Make an Impact\\". Development and Change 46 (2), Pp. 197‚Äì224. Influenced by Amartya Sen's capability approach and by work on multidimensional poverty indicators undertaken by the Oxford Human Development Initiative and the United Nations Development Programme, Sehnbruch argues that conceptualising and measuring the quality of employment, preferably by means of a composite indicator, is essential to attracting more policy attention to employment issues in developing countries. In addition to her work on the quality of employment, Sehnbruch has written many articles on Chilean politics and public policy. Her 2013 book, co-edited with Peter Siavelis, Democratic Chile: The Politics and Policies of a Historic Coalition, 1990‚Äì2010, examines how the political and institutional legacy of the Pinochet dictatorship shaped both the political and policy development led by the Concertaci√≥n between Chile's transition to democracy, and the first government of Michelle Bachelet after which the coalition lost the elections to the centre-right candidate Sebasti√°n Pi√±era. From 2011 to 2017, Sehnbruch led the team of researchers from the University of Chile for NOPOOR project, founded by the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission. In 2013, she coordinated a proposal for a FONDAP research hub on social conflict and cohesion that was funded by the Chilean National Research Council (Conicyt) and later became known as El Centro para el Estudio de Conflictos y Cohesi√≥n Social (COES). Sehnbruch then served as a founding board member of the centre between 2013 and 2019. In 2018, Sehnbruch was awarded a 4 year British Academy Global Professorship to study The Quality of Employment (QoE) in Middle Income Countries.  Biography  Sehnbruch and Brendan Burchell presenting on the quality and future of employment in FACSO Sehnbruch was born in Oberhausen, Germany, and raised in London (where she attended to the German School London), and in Kirchen, Germany. Sehnbruch studied modern and medieval languages at Jesus College, Cambridge. During her undergraduate degree, she worked as a trainee auditor for Price Waterhouse in Buenos Aires, where she gained first-hand experience of development issues. After graduating from Cambridge, she worked as an equity analyst for Goldman Sachs Asset Management in London. In 1997, she moved to Brussels to work at the European Commission on the Mexico Desk of the Directorate-General for External Relations with the team that negotiated the Global Agreement on Free Trade with Mexico. That year, she also returned to the University of Cambridge to undertake a Masters in Philosophy (MPhil) in Latin American Studies, focussing on economics and sociology. She subsequently undertook a PhD in social and political sciences at the University of Cambridge, which analysed the quality of employment in the Chilean labour market, and was published as the book The Chilean Labor Market: A Key to understanding Latin American Labor Markets by Palgrave Macmillan in 2006. Following her PhD, Sehnbruch worked as a lecturer and senior scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. In 2009, she moved to Chile where she worked at the Faculty of Economics of the Universidad de Chile and as director of the Institute for Public Policy at the Universidad Diego Portales. During this time, Sehnbruch was instrumental in co-ordinating a significant grant from the Chilean government to set up a research hub on social conflict and cohesion (Centro de Estudios de Conflicto y Cohesi√≥n Social), based at the University of Chile and the Catholic University of Chile. COES undertakes multidisciplinary research on subjects related to social conflict and cohesion in Chile. It brings together a group of more than 50 researchers from all social science disciplines as well as a network of international researchers from around the world. Sehnbruch was a member of the COES board for five years. Sehnbruch has consistently worked on the subject of the quality of employment in developing countries. Her work conceptualises and measures the quality of employment using the theoretical framework of Amartya Sen's capability approach and the empirical methodology developed by Sabina Alkire and James Foster. Her work argues that measuring the performance of a developing country's labour market by focusing only on the quantity of jobs, as expressed by its unemployment rate, is as simplistic as measuring a country's level of development only by its GDP per capita level. More sophisticated, multidimensional measures are required that focus on the quality of jobs.  Media  For several years, Sehnbruch wrote a blog for one of Chile's principal newspapers, La Tercera. She maintains an active profile in the Chilean press, but has also written for The Guardian, The Washington Post's Monkey Cage, Open Democracy and the Inter-American Dialogue.

She was one of the contributors to the first annual exhibition of the American Watercolor Society in 1867/1868. Early life Autumn Leaves ca. 1870, Philadelphia Museum of Art Born in 1828 in Watertown, Massachusetts, Ellen Robbins was the youngest child of a factory owner who died when she was still a child. His factory subsequently burned down, and the combination of events left the family in straitened circumstances. Robbins began trying to help the family's finances by getting work while still very young. After trying various domestic arts, she turned to watercolor painting. Although she received some training from an artist named Stephen Salisbury Tuckerman, she was largely self-taught. Career Asters, chromolithograph (Boston Public Library) In her twenties, Robbins began producing books of flower illustrations and selling them for the then very substantial sum of $25 each. Her success with these led her to broaden out from flowers to autumn leaves. She was known for work so realistic that, as one contemporary wrote, bees might light on her flowers. Similarly, her leaf paintings are still occasionally mistaken for real leaves by viewers. The art historian Samuel Benjamin considered her \\"one of the finest still life painters in America.\\" Another art historian, however, has compared the \\"harsh edges and forthright local color\\" of Robbins's flower paintings unfavorably to the work of Childe Hassam, yet those are precisely the qualities that her fans admire. In addition to publishing books, Robbins sold original paintings through a shop in Boston. Her work became fashionable in both America and England, and she began painting botanical designs on china and even furniture for her clients. In the 1840s, she began creating textile designs, as well as designs for tiles and needlework. In the 1840s, she began also to teach watercolor painting. In the late 1860s, after the introduction of chromolithography, the lithographer Louis Prang hired her to create a series of flowers and autumn leaves specifically to be sold as prints. Through contacts among prominent Bostonians like Henry Ward Beecher, she was invited to create a frieze (since destroyed) at Wellesley College outside Boston. With increasing success, Robbins was able to travel abroad and to take time off in the summer, when she often spent time in Maine with the writer Celia Thaxter. She became one of the first of a series of prominent artists who stayed at Thaxter's Appledore House hotel, where she painted the flowers in its famous garden. An inscription on one of her paintings suggests that she got married in 1858, but her husband's name is not recorded. In 1896, she published a series of articles in New England Magazine reflecting on her life, entitled \\"Reminiscences of a Flower Painter.\\" Publications *Autumnal Leaves (1868, 18 watercolors) Gallery File:Purple Wisteria (Boston Public Library).jpgPurple Wisteria, chromolithograph (Boston Public Library) File:Hyacinths (Boston Public Library).jpgHyacinths, chromolithograph (Boston Public Library) File:Wild Flowers No. 2 (Boston Public Library).jpgWild Flowers No. 2, chromolithograph (Boston Public Library) References Category:1828 births Category:1905 deaths Category:Botanical illustrators Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:Painters from Massachusetts Category:19th-century American women artists Category:People from Watertown, Massachusetts ","title":"Ellen Robbins"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(P,[["render",I]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/41.md","filePath":"drive/41.md"}'),H={name:"drive/41.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{E as __pageData,L as default};
