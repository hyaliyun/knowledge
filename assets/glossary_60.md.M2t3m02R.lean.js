Tregarthen's was the very first hotel to be established on the Isles of Scilly, having been founded in 1849 by Captain Frank Tregarthen, who ran the packet ship delivering mail, provisions and visitors between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly. History Up until the mid-nineteenth century, there was no regular transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland UK. Then, in 1849, the locals on Scilly decided to resolve this situation and provide a sloop as a connecting link with the mainland. There was great local excitement when this sailing packet, named Ariadne, was first brought to the islands by its skipper, Captain Frank Tregarthen.Scilly and the Scillonians by JG Uren. UK Rare Books Club (1907) Page 95. The Ariadne was introduced into service in 1850. Between 1849 and 1858, with his three daughters, Captain Frank Tregarthen opened up his family house at the foot of the Garrison Hill to paying guests. Captain Frank would load up the boat with mail, provisions and adventurous passengers in Penzance and bring them to his house for their stay on the islands. Thus Tregarthen's Hotel was established ‚Äì the very first hotel on the isles of Scilly.Scilly and the Scillonians by JG Uren. UK Rare Books Club (1907) Page 58. ‚ÄúVisitors to Scilly were few and far between. No one ever thought of going to the Islands for pleasure, and those whose business called them there were only too anxious to get away on the first favourable opportunity. But here was the rub. Captain Frank kept the only hotel, and was in this peculiar position: his guests could not possibly get away until he chose to take them. He usually counted heads before leaving Penzance, and laid in a stock of provisions accordingly. His customers were rounded-up like sheep in a South American corral, and there were no means of escape unless one swam across. There you were willy nilly, and, somehow or other, the weather never pointed to set fair until all the provisions had been consumed, and to avoid semi-starvation it was necessary to go back to the mainland to replenish the larder.‚ÄùScilly and the Scillonians by JG Uren. UK Rare Books Club.(1907) Page 96. Tourism on Scilly started in earnest once the Cornwall Railway link from Penzance to London was completed in 1859.Inside the Archipelago by Roger Banfield. Isles of Scilly Museum p25. The steamer Little Western took the place of the Ariadne and, for the first time, visitors could make the crossing from Penzance in only four hours - considerably faster than the cutter Ariadne, which could take a day or two. The Little Western was the Isles of Scilly's first Steam Packet boat and made around three voyages from Scilly to Penzance and back each week.Scilly and the Scillonians by JG Uren. UK Rare Books Club (1907) Page 102. Captain Tregarthen was captain of the Little Western from 1859-1870. The Little Western was a small ship, and her crew consisted of only five hands ‚Äì captain, mate, engineer, deck-hand and stoker. Despite the challenges and perils of the voyage, she usually made good passage to the islands, and was able to provide service all year round.Scilly and the Scillonians by JG Uren. UK Rare Books Club (1907) Page 103. Transferred to the West Cornwall Steam Ship Company in 1871, for the sum of ¬£2,640 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), the Little Western was wrecked on the Wells Reef on 6 October 1872 attempting to give aid to a disabled brigantine.The Wrecks of Scilly by Richard Larn. Shipwreck and Marine (2001) Pages 120-121. The Little Western played a significant part in the history of the islands as well as the heritage of Tregarthen's Hotel. That is why the hotel's logo features an image of the Little Western and the terrace at the hotel is named The Little Western Deck. A fire broke out on Sunday 26 February 1905 when a defective chimney took fire and this spread to an adjoining bedroom. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished but the damage amounted to ¬£50. During the First World War, Tregarthen's Hotel was commandeered by the Admiralty and acted as a Ward Room for officers who were billeted at the White House on the Garrison. Tregarthen's Hotel was commissioned by the Admiralty on 1 June 1918 and surrendered on 28 February 1919. Commander HW Randall RNR was the Senior Officer.Isles of Scilly Museum. Tregarthen‚Äôs Visitor Book. (1897-1937) The present day Tregarthen's Hotel has been built around the original living quarters of Captain Frank Tregarthen . Famous visitors Wilkie Collins stayed at Tregarthen's for one night in 1855 during a twelve-day cruise of the Scillies . Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote Enoch Arden during his stay at Tregarthen's Hotel in 1860. This is celebrated with a plaque at the hotel . In around 1903 the hotel hosted the infamous killer Dr Crippen and his wife Cora (aka the aspiring music hall performer Belle Elmore). Indeed, during his stay Dr Crippen safely delivered his boatman's wife's baby daughter . Prince Charles visited Tregarthen's Hotel on two occasions for meetings with the Duchy Tenants Association. His most recent visit to the islands with the Duchess of Cornwall was in August 2012 to see the new school, which he helped design. Queen Elizabeth II visited the hotel on 3 June 2011, when Tregarthen's Hotel hosted an official reception for ninety people. Ownership Tregarthen's remained a family owned and run business until 15 February 1915 when a company was formed with a Penzance estate agent, WH Lane, followed by his son Thurstan T Lane, as chairmen. The hotel remained in the same ownership for a century, with WH Lane's grandson, Jonathan Lane, becoming Director in 1980 and then Chairman. On 24 April 2015, Tregarthen's Hotel was sold to Nigel and Jackie Wolstenholme, for whom it is a first hotel venture. Other business interests of Nigel and Jackie Wolstenholme include the 25 acre Somborne Valley Vineyard in Hampshire. Gig racing Tregarthen's Hotel supports the popular sport of Cornish pilot gig racing. In 1999 the hotel donated a pilot gig called Tregarthen's to the Isles of Scilly Rowing Association to celebrate the hotel's 150th anniversary. The hotel donated and launched a second gig to the Association in 2012 during the World Pilot Gig Championships, which are held annually on the first Bank Holiday each May since 1989.

Life and career MacGregor was a prolific author of Gaelic poetry, reflecting a wealth of inherited oral tradition, particularly relating to the MacGregors of Perthshire. He was the first Gaelic-speaking minister in Nova Scotia (then experiencing a high rate of immigration from the Scottish Highlands) and in 1819 published a book of hymns in Gaelic that he composed in Canada. Influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment, MacGregor published Letter to a Clergyman Urging him to set free a Black Girl he held in Slavery in Halifax, Nova Scotia (1788).

Killen-Strait Tractor, experimental armoured tracked vehicle History The company made tractors. The company came from Killen-Walsh Manufacturing Company, which changed its name to Killen-Strait in 1914, to build the Strait's Tractor. Structure It was based in Appleton, Wisconsin in the USA. Products The Killen-Strait Tractor was powered by a choice of 25-40HP Waukesha Engines, with Remy ignition systems. Two models of tractor were built - a 30-50 model and a 15-30 model.The Devil's Chariots: The origins and secret battles of tanks in the First World War Development of the military tank A Killen-Strait took part in a demonstration on 30 June 1915 at Wembley Park, in front of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George as a vehicle that could cross obstacles and cut barbed wire. On the same day, the War Office had passed its specification for a machine gun destroyer to the Admiralty's Landship Committee (based at 83 Pall Mall). From the demonstration of the tractor cutting barbed wire, responsibility of the Landship Committee was passed from the Admiralty to the new Ministry of Munitions. The tracked Killen-Strait Tractor significantly inspired the design of what would later that year become the tank. The tracked Killen-Strait Tractor had one track at the front and two at the back.

Dee was born to Bartholomew Fromond (or Fromonds) in Cheam in Surrey, EnglandDeborah Harkness, 'Managing an Experimental Household: the Dees of Mortlake and the Practice of Natural Philosophy, Isis, 88:2 (1997), p. 251. Before her marriage to John Dee, she was a lady-in-waiting in the entourage of the Countess of Lincoln at the court of Queen Elizabeth I.William H. Sherman, John Dee: the Politics of Reading and Writing in the English Renaissance (Amherst, 1995), p. 7. Her court connections to Elizabeth and to other ladies in waiting may have significantly helped her husband secure patronage.Sherman, p. 7. Marriage Jane married John Dee in 1578 when she was 23 and he was 51. Dee was a noted natural philosopher who was particularly interested in divination, Hermetic philosophy and alchemy. John Dee He acted as an astronomical and medical advisor to Queen Elizabeth and travelled in Europe studying and advising other European nobles.R. Julian Roberts, ‚ÄòDee, John (1527‚Äì1609)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 29 Jan 2015 After their marriage, Jane moved to Dee's home at Mortlake, south-west of London.Mortlake Green They had a large household of family and servants which Jane had a large role in managing, as well as frequent visitors who collaborated with John on a variety of experiments which he conducted in their home. Jane and their children also travelled with Dee to Poland in 1584 to work for Albertus Laski, a Polish nobleman. She had a son while in Krak√≥w, waiting to join her husband in Prague.Richard Deacon, John Dee (Letchworth, 1968), pp 190-2. We know a great deal about Jane Dee because of the detailed diaries and records kept by her husband.Julian Roberts, ed. (2005). A John Dee Chronology, 1509‚Äì1609\\". Renaissance Man: The Reconstructed Libraries of European Scholars: 1450‚Äì1700 Series One: The Books and Manuscripts of John Dee, 1527‚Äì1608. Adam Matthew Publications Dee recorded interactions between himself and his wife, arguments, and many details of their household. Such detail about the daily life of a sixteenth-century woman is extremely rare. Involvement in experimentation Dee's diaries record Jane's involvement in his scientific investigations. He recorded her menstrual cycles, their sexual relations and the births of their children, as well as investigating their miscarried child in an effort to better understand reproduction.Harkness, p. 256. In 1582, Dee began to attempt communications with angels with a new associate, Edward Kelly (alias Talbot) who acted as a scryer. Jane distrusted Kelley from the start, and Dee records several instances of friction between his wife and associate. When Kelley married a young wife, Joanna Cooper, and, according to Dee, neglected her, this may have worsened Jane and Kelley's relationship, since Jane sympathised with Joanna.Susan Bassnett, 'Absent Presences: Edward Kelley's Family in the Writings of John Dee' in Stephen Clucas (ed.), John Dee: Interdisciplinary Studies in English Renaissance Thought (Dordrecht, 2006), pp 227-8. Nevertheless, in 1585, Jane sought Kelley's help as she attempted to communicate with these angels. She asked them about her family's precarious financial situation and asked for help and reassurance. Dee's papers record her petition: 'Deacon, p. 192. Jane took an even more involved role in Dee's experimentation in 1587, when the Dees and Kelleys were both living in T≈ôebo≈à. Kelley claimed to have communication from the angelic visitors Madimi and Ill that Dee and Kelly should exchange wives in the interest of furthering their philosophical partnership. Dee initially objected to the arrangement but was convinced by the insistent urging of the angel through Kelly. When informed of the angels suggested arrangement, Jane Dee objected strenuously and 'fell a weeping and trembling for a quarter of an hour' but John convinced her that it was God's will that the men share everything. Jane and John and Edward Kelley and his wife, Joanna, soon signed an agreement and the physical relationships seem to have been consummated soon after.Harkness, p. 257. Some historians have speculated that Jane's son Theodore, born in 1588, may have been Kelley's and that his name was chosen to reference his father.Roberts, ODNB A Magician by Edward Kelly Dee and Kelley's conversations with angels ceased after this communication, and their close collaboration ended in 1589 when Dee and his family returned to England.Roberts, ODNB Later life and death After their return to England, Dee continued to record details about Jane, including their sexual activity and frequent cryptic notes, written in Greek meaning 'Jane had them'. The meaning of these notes is not certain, but they have been interpreted as meaning that Jane had dreams or visions.Deacon, p. 252. Jane gave birth to three daughters in this period: Madini in 1590, Frances in 1592, and Margaret in 1595.Roberts, ODNB Dee secured a post as warden of the collegiate church in Manchester and Jane and their children moved there with him in 1596. Jane died of the bubonic plague in Manchester in 1605 and was buried at Manchester Cathedral. Children Jane was John's second or third wife, but the first with whom he had children. The couple had eight children together: four sons named Michael, Theodore, Arthur and Rowland and four daughters named Madinia, Frances, Margaret and Katherine. Michael (d. 1594), Theodore (d. 1601) and Margaret (d. 1603) predeceased their mother. Madinia and Frances may have died of the same bubonic plague as their mother in 1604‚Äì5.R.

Located on the shores of Lake Lucerne, it looks out over Lucerne bay and the Alps of Central Switzerland. It offers 41 rooms and suites as well as 22 residence suites, plus four restaurants, a caf√© and a bar. In terms of its fabric and architecture, the hotel has been designated a cultural monument of national importance, with a Category A heritage protection listing.[1] History = Lakeside promenade: land reclamation and construction = 258x258px Until well into the 19th century Lucerne offered little by way of overnight accommodation. It was only with the advent of tourism midway through that century that the local council approved measures with the intention of exploiting the potential of the town's setting and scenery. The northern shoreline of the lake ‚Äì now graced by the promenade and large hotels ‚Äì was originally marshland. Work on reclaiming the area between the town and the Hof Church (the Church of St. Leodegar) began in 1836, followed by the building of the Schweizerhofquai promenade. This allowed the old Hofbr√ºcke Bridge, needed for crossing the marshland, to be done away with. The long-established Lucerne-based von Segesser von Brunegg family recognised the sign of the times; 1845 saw the brothers Eduard, Placidus and Xaver von Segesser von Brunegg establish the town's first hotel, the Schweizerhof, which they situated by the lake specifically to take advantage of the fine views. The nascent railway arrived in Lucerne in 1859, thus signalling the start of a boom in foreign visitors from the upper social classes. The need for more accommodation for these well-heeled travellers soon became apparent. The von Segessers sold the Schweizerhof together with the adjacent hotel erected in 1865, the Luzernerhof, and founded the construction company Segesser & Cie in partnership with Eduard von Segesser's son-in-law Alphons Maximilian Pfyffer von Altishofen (otherwise known as Max Alphons Pfyffer); they acquired land in the outlying Unteren Halde district of Lucerne. The stipulations of the local authority were clear: a hotel palace had to be erected by 1870 capable of boosting Lucerne's standing in the burgeoning competition between tourist resorts. The dimensions of the project under consideration went beyond anything built to date: 84 metres in length and 27 metres high, i.e. half of today's volume = Opening, Ritz era, expansions = Bond of the Grand Hotel National in Lucerne, issued 1. April 1904 Following two years or so of construction work, the H√¥tel National was completed in time for the start of the 1870 season ‚Äì only to be thwarted in its hopes for a glittering opening season by the looming Franco-Prussian War: foreign tourism collapsed. It was only after the war ended shortly before the 1871 summer season that the hotel was able to commence operations in earnest under its first director, Max Alphons Pfyffer. The lingering economic depression in Europe had the National facing a challenging environment; the time had arrived for a change of management. C√©sar Ritz, founder of the hotel dynasty, took over the running of the National at the end of the 1870s. He increased its comfort, perfected the service and landed a coup in 1881 by hiring an executive chef who was already a legend: Auguste Escoffier. The hotel could at last flourish. Ritz led the National until 1890, when he was succeeded by A. M. Pfyffer's sons Alphons and Hans Pfyffer. To coincide with the change at the helm, the establishment's legal form was altered: formerly a limited partnership, it became a public limited company by the name of Grand Hotel National AG, with C√©sar Ritz on the board of directors. Tourism in the meantime had been put on a more professional footing, tourist boards were being established and international networks forged: at the time, Lucerne was still regarded purely as a summer destination, and the clientele travelled further south for the winter. The newly established tourist board published its first figures: in 1892 78,000 visitors took advantage of overnight accommodation offered by the town's hotels and guest houses, a figure rising to almost 140,000 in 1900. The Grand H√¥tel National (as it was now called) found itself running short of space, so the decision was made to expand: 1897 saw the opening of the dining room annexe on the east side, while what used to be the dining room became the ballroom. This signalled the start of a series of expansions and refurbishments: a large annexe, the Nationalhof, was conceived as a heated winter house, which, for the first time, allowed the hotel to remain open all year round. The wing was opened in 1900, and the year-round opening did much to enhance the hotel's prestige. Also for the first time, \\"apartments\\" were created ‚Äì as suites, they became standard fare in all luxury hotels. The third expansion in 1910 involved adding a floor to the intermediate wing linking the Grand H√¥tel with the Nationalhof. = Belle √âpoque, World Wars = The Belle √âpoque saw Lucerne consolidate its reputation as a tourist destination, with up to 190,000 travellers a year visiting the town of just 35,000 inhabitants. The National was on course for success; the investments were proving their worth. When the First World War broke out, however, visitor numbers plummeted and a number of staff were called up for war service; only once the war was over did matters improve. On 22 August 1920 the hotel played host to a historic event: the Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti and his British counterpart David Lloyd George met here to implement the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty. Tourism flourished, with visitor numbers by 1923 exceeding those before the War. The Great Depression, however, was to bring the recovery to a sudden end. Tourism recovered only after the Second World War, although it was now much altered in nature: travelling had become considerably cheaper, and the car led to an additional democratisation of tourism ‚Äì increasing numbers of motorists saw Lucerne not as a destination, but as a staging post. In 1954 Hans F. Elmiger, a grandson of M. A. Pfyffer and nephew of Hans Pfyffer, was appointed director of the hotel, where bed numbers had been reduced from 405 to 300. It underwent a thoroughgoing refurbishment in 1957/58, which also involved \\"purifying\\" the facade and removing the neo-baroque sandstone ornamentation.Grand Hotel National. = Umberto Erculiani era = The early 1970s found the former palace in dire economic straits, with rumours circulating the town suggesting that the hotel might make way for a shopping mall. Cue the appearance of the architect Umberto Erculiani. He acquired the shares of the Grand Hotel National AG and presented a multiple use concept for the complex: shops and restaurants would be open to the public, there would be less emphasis on hospitality, and some of the premises would be let as office space.[2] At the same time, \\"residence suite\\" tenancies would attract a new, well-heeled customer segment. The western, and oldest, wing of the building was refurbished in 1977 and two restaurants integrated into it. The ground floor now featured an end-to-end passage open to the general public. In addition, the neighbouring building received two nightclubs. The hotel entrance was relocated, the eastern part expanded and transformed into a hotel wing, and an indoor swimming pool added. Ensuing years saw the residences built in the western part as suites for extended or permanent stays. The hotel operations were subjected to further pruning in 2001: the hotel in the east wing was henceforth to acquire a 5-star rating, while the west wing continues to host the residence suites.  Present  In autumn 2015 the Grand Hotel National was offering 41 rooms and suites in the hotel wing, plus 22 residence suites for longer-term and permanent stays. The entire length of the ground floor is accessible to the public and features four restaurants (the National, the 1871, the Il Padrino, and the Jialu National), plus a caf√© and a bar.

It is a silane that substitutes hydrogen with fluorine and chlorine atoms. Production By heating a mixture of anhydrous aluminium chloride and sodium hexafluorosilicate to between 190 and 250¬∞C a mixture of gases containing chlorotrifluorosilane is given off. These are condensed at -196¬∞C degrees and fractionally distilled at temperatures up to -78¬∞C. SiClF3 can be made by reacting silicon tetrachloride and silicon tetrafluoride gases at 600¬∞C, producing a mixture of fluorochloro silanes including about one quarter SiClF3. SiClF3 can be made by reacting silicon tetrachloride with antimony trifluoride. An antimony pentachloride catalyst assists. The products are distilled to separate it out from tetrafluorosilane and dichlorodifluorosilane. At high temperatures above 500¬∞C silicon tetrafluoride can react with phosphorus trichloride to yield some SiClF3. This is unusual because SiF4 is very stable. Silicon tetrachloride can react with trifluoro(trichloromethyl)silane to yield SiClF3 and CCl3SiCl3. 2-Chloroethyltrifluorosilane or 1,2-dichloroethyltrifluorosilane can be disassociated by an infrared laser to yield SiClF3 and C2H4 (ethylene) or vinyl chloride. By tuning the laser to a vibration frequency of a particular isotope of silicon, different isotomers can be selectively broken up in order to have a product that only concentrates one isotope of silicon. So silicon-30 can be increased to 80% by using the 934.5 cm‚àí1 line in a CO2 laser. The first published preparation of SiClF3 by Schumb and Gamble was by exploding hexafluorodisilane in chlorine: Si2F6 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí 2SiClF3. Other products of this explosion may include amorphous silicon, SiCl2F2 and SiF4. Chlorine reacts with silicon tetrafluoride in the presence of aluminium chips at 500-600¬∞C to make mostly silicon tetra chloride and some SiClF3. Mercuric chloride when heated with SiF3Co(CO)4 breaks the bond to form a 90% yield of SiClF3. The combination of SiF4 and dimethylchlorophosphine and yield some SiClF3. Trifluorosilane SiHF3 reacts with gaseous chlorine to yield SiClF3 and HCl. Properties =Molecular size and angles= Bond length for Si‚ÄìCl is 1.996 √Ö and for Si‚ÄìF is 1.558 √Ö. The bond angle ‚à†FSiCl = 110.2¬∞ and ‚à†FSiF = 108.7¬∞. The bond length between silicon and chlorine is unusually short, indicating a 31% double bond. This can be explained by the more ionic fluoride bonds withdrawing some charge allowing a partial positive charge on the chlorine. The molecular dipole moment is 0.636 Debye. =Bulk properties= Between 129.18 and 308.83 K the vapour pressure in mm Hg at temperature T in K is given by log10 P = 102.6712 -2541.6/T -43.347 log10 T + 0.071921T -0.000045231 T2. The heat of formation of chlorotrifluorosilane is -315.0 kcal/mol at 298K. Reactions Chlorotrifluorosilane is hydrolysed by water to produce silica. Chlorotrifluorosilane reacts with trimethylstannane ((CH3)3SnH) at room temperature to make trifluorosilane in about 60 hours. Use Proposed uses include a dielectric gas with a high breakdown voltage, and low global warming potential, a precursor for making fluorinated silica soot, and a vapour deposition gas. Related substances Chlorotrifluorosilane can form an addition compound with pyridine with formula SiClF3.2py (py=pyridine) An addition compound with trimethylamine exists. This addition compound is made by mixing trimethylamine vapour with Chlorotrifluorosilane and condensing out a solid at -78¬∞C. If this was allowed to soak in trimethylamine liquid for over eight hours, a diamine complex formed (2Me3N¬∑SiClF3). At 0¬∞ the disassociation pressure of the monoamine complex was 23 mm Hg. SiClF3‚àí is a trigonal bipyramidal shape with a Cl and F atom on the axis. It is formed when gamma rays hit the neutral molecule. Chlorotetrafluorosilicate (IV) (SiClF4‚àí) can form a stable a pale yellow crystalline compound tetraethylammonium tlorotetrafluorosilicate.

The charity has provided scholarships, vocational training and material assistance to polio victims across the world to ensure they can live dignified, independent lives. Origins In 1938, Vaghjibhai Ranchodbhai Patel, a 17-year-old son of a poor farmer in Gujarat, India completed his high school education. Yet despite passing with outstanding grades he was unable to pursue further studies because of his family‚Äôs poor economic situation. However, he was determined that his children would not face the same fate and subsequently supported their education at any cost. The overriding message emitted by Vaghjibhai Patel that education is the only key to gain freedom from poverty was never far from the minds of his 3 sons. It was therefore no surprise that in late 2002 when Arun Patel, a polio sufferer himself, came across a newspaper article on a boarding school looking after poor and polio ridden children in Rajasthan, India, the three of them decided to visit to evaluate what help could be provided. This first visit to the school (SKSN - Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan) left them with an overwhelming desire to help change the lives of those children for good. Hence, they immediately proceeded to set up Polio Children as a registered charity in the UK and the USA. Since its formation in 2003, Polio Children, with the help of thousands of friends and well wishers from around the world has continued to work in partnership with its Indian and African counterparts to educate the poor and physically challenged children so they could all look forward to a life of hope and dignity. Founding Trustees In addition to founding Polio Children and the OKAS Fund, Arun Patel is a trustee of the Isha Foundation. He is a retired chartered accountant and was a member of the ICAEW. He remains active with Rotary International through the Rotary Club of Dagenham in London. Dr. Shirish Patel is also a founding trustee of Polio Children and the OKAS Fund. He obtained his medical degree from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, and is a member of the Royal College of Physicians. He is currently a Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Rochester specialising in psychiatry. Mayoor Patel attended Marlborough College and the Chelsea College of Science and Technology before attaining his degree from Surrey University. As well as founding Polio Children and the OKAS Fund along with his brothers, Mayoor Patel is also on the National Advisory Council for Milapfest, an Indian Arts Development Trust. He has also been involved with the Little Drops Shravana Project since 2007 (for the hearing impaired), a charity which aims to improve health and education in developing countries. Projects Polio Children currently supports projects in India, Tanzania and South Sudan, with projects pending to begin in Sierra Leone. =India= Polio Children work in partnership with the Indiability Foundation to support the Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan (SKSN) Institute in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Since its inception in 1991 the SKSN institute has flourished from educating just 15 disabled boys into a boarding school now holding over 200 disabled and able-bodied boys and girls. Polio Children‚Äôs fundraising efforts, along with generous donations from other organisations around the world, have enabled the school to build a computer lab, a library and a prosthetics laboratory where, funds permitting, bespoke artificial limbs can be manufactured. Polio Children's most significant contribution to SKSN was the construction of a girls hostel to provide accommodation for the female students of the school. The 140-bed Academic Training and Vocational Centre for Girls was opened in 2004 and enabled the school to enrol over three times as many female students who were previously unable to travel to classes each day. Polio Children also fund a scholarship program allowing over 220 graduates to attend higher education institutions where they train to become doctors, engineers and teachers who often return to SKSN to teach the current crop of students. Janak Singh, a previous student of SKSN who now teaches at the school, went on to represent India in the mini Para Olympic Games held in England in 2009. Despite suffering from polio, he won 5 gold medals for his outstanding cricketing ability. Kitchen built in Kwa Mkono Polio Camp, Tanzania =Tanzania= Polio Children also works in partnership with the Kwa Mkono Disabled Children‚Äôs Trust to support the Kwa Mkono Disabled Children's Centre (formerly known as The Kwa Mkono Polio Hostel). The hostel offers rehabilitation, education and training to physically disabled young people which allows them to live independently when they leave. Polio Children supports an ongoing education programme for the academically-abled hostel residents, and has donated agricultural vehicles to help cultivate nearby land for self-sufficiency, along with a Land Rover for transport. Funds have also been provided to improve the infrastructure and security of the hostel with a perimeter fence and extension of the common room. In 2016, Polio Children funded the building of a new kitchen at the camp with energy efficient, low emissions stoves installed to reduce indoor air pollution. A polio sufferer at the camp expressed her gratitude at the donation by saying Polio sufferers at Magbenteh Polio Camp, Makeni receive humanitarian donation, 2016 =South Sudan= Polio Children works with Building Minds in South Sudan (BMISS), a non-profit organisation that provides educational opportunities to villagers in the Republic of South Sudan. The organisation seeks to restore hope by providing an education for people adversely affected by conflict in Sudan. =Sierra Leone= Polio Children is working with the Magbenteh Polio Camp in Makeni to establish self-sustaining revenue generating projects. Despite the challenges presented by the ongoing Ebola crisis, in 2016 Polio Children contributed to the rehabilitation of the camp by donating cooking equipment and food. =Kenya= In 2016, Polio Children worked in partnership with the Olympia Wafula Foundation, a charity established by paralympian Anne Wafula Strike, which promotes social inclusion and empowerment of differently-abled and disadvantaged persons. Together they provided tricycles for polio sufferers living in remote areas of Kenya. Awards & Recognition In 2012 the chairman, Arun Patel, was chosen as one of only 7 Paralympic torchbearers to carry the National Flame of England, and has been honoured by both the British Citizen Awards and the Redbridge Cultural Association for his philanthropic work with the charity. Arun has also been nominated and shortlisted for both the Asian Achievers Award (2008, 2015) and World of Children Awards (2014, 2015). In addition, his brother Mayoor Patel was also nominated for the British Polio Fellowship Awards in 'Helper of the Year' category in 2008. In November 2015, the UK Prime Minister David Cameron awarded Arun & Mayoor Patel the Points of Light Award to recognise the positive impact the charity has had on polio afflicted children across the world. The Prime Minister said: In January 2016, The Independent reported that UK founding trustee Mayoor Patel was to be recognised in the British Citizen Awards. Mayoor Patel was awarded a BCA in the International Achievement category as a result of his endeavours to allow children disadvantaged by poverty to access university education. Polio Children was selected as a winner at the 2016 Asian Voice Charity Awards powered by Charity Clarity in recognition of their fundraising endeavours to support their portfolio of projects. In July 2016, Polio Children was also a finalist in the Charity Initiative of the Year category of the British Indian Awards. The awards recognise the commitment and hard work of the Indian community in contributing to a better society. Fundraising As a charity, Polio Children relies heavily on voluntary contributions from members of the public and philanthropic organisations. The trustees of the charity bear all the administration costs themselves ensuring 100% of the donations can be spent on the projects the charity supports.

Their larvae are known by the common name of blood worm due to their red colouration. It is common in both North America and Europe. The species was described in 1804 by Johann Wilhelm Meigen. C. riparius has been used extensively as a model for genome structure analysis in insects and is also used in toxicology tests and functional developmental genetic studies. Both their adult and larval forms have been implicated as disease vectors but are also an important part of freshwater food chains. Taxonomy German naturalist Johann Wilhelm Meigen named the genus Chironomus in 1803 and described the harlequin fly species in 1804 as Chironomus riparius. Description Harlequin flies are small dipterans which resemble mosquitoes. Life cycle Eggs are laid in or near the water. Larvae are red due to a large amount of haemoglobin in their blood, which leads to their common name of blood worms. The larvae use this haemoglobin as an oxygen store, allowing them to survive in low oxygen conditions such as at the bottom of a lake or in areas with high organic pollution. Larvae build chimneys to live in and protect them from hypoxia until they are ready to become adults. Adults live for only a short period of two or three days. Males form a large mating swarm which the females fly into to select a mate to breed. Distribution and habitat The harlequin fly is found in North America, primarily on the east coast but often also found in southern Alaska and throughout northern Europe, ranging from as far north as northern Scotland to southern Germany. Predation Larvae are predated upon by many other species of insect and also by fish. Use in genetic experimentation Chironomus riparius are easy to maintain in a laboratory environment and has been used extensively as a model for genome structure analysis in insects and is also used in toxicology tests and functional developmental genetic studies. Disease vector Both their adult and larval forms have been implicated as disease vectors. As they tend to emerge in large numbers, they have been reported to cause pest problems. During development the flies‚Äô discard exoskeleton fragments and the particulate can accumulate in settlements close to the lakes and rivers where the flies reside. This particulate, combined with particles from the decomposing bodies of the swarms of flies, can cause conjunctivitis, rhinitis and asthma by inhalation. Use in forensic entomology In June 2013, the corpse of a young woman was found floating in a stretch of the Genil river located in an urban environment in Granada (Spain, SE Iberian Peninsula). Several C. riparius larvae were found on the scalp during the autopsy and identified morphologically and by molecular biology methods. The life cycle of this species was very useful when assessing the postmortem interval (PMI), that is, the time elapsed from death to the finding of the corpse. In this case, a PMI of about two weeks was estimated. This was the first time that developmental parameters were used in an aquatic forensic context.

After Virchow's death, it was renamed after him to Virchows Archiv f√ºr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f√ºr klinische Medizin. The European Society of Pathology adopted it as its official journal in 1999, so that its current name became Virchows Archiv: European Journal of Pathology.  Origin and history  In 1846, Rudolf Virchow earned his medical license, and succeeded Robert Froriep as prosector at the Charit√© Hospital in Berlin. In 1847 he became \\"privatdozent\\". However, he soon found that his technical manuscripts were constantly rejected by medical journals. In protest he established a new journal, then named Archiv f√ºr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f√ºr klinische Medicin (Archives of Pathological Anatomy and Physiology and of Clinical Medicine), which he edited with his colleague Benno Reinhardt. He declared that the aim of the journal was to unite the branches of clinical medicine, pathological anatomy, and physiology. The first issue was published in February 1847 and contained only four articles ‚Äì two by Virchow, one by Reinhardt, and one by Rud Leubuscher ‚Äì and written entirely in German. After Reinhardt's death in 1852, Virchow continued to edit the journal until his own death in 1902. After Virchow's death, the editors decided to honor him and the journal became Virchows Archiv f√ºr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f√ºr klinische Medizin in 1903. The first English text appeared in 1960, and from that point onward English articles were frequently included. With the expanding field of pathology, it was decided in 1968 to divide the journal into two sections, namely part A dedicated to Pathologische Anatomie und Histologie and part B for Zellpathologie, later changed into Pathological Anatomy and Histology and Cell Pathology respectively, as the publication became more internationally oriented. Its entire publication language became English by the late 1970s, and the long German name of the journal itself was deleted. In 1994 the sister journals part A and B were merged with a new subtitle An International Journal of Pathology. The European Society of Pathology adopted it as its official journal in 1999. In 2009 the society changed the subtitle to The European Journal of Pathology.  Abstracting and indexing  The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Science Citation Index, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Chemical Abstracts Service, EBSCO databases, CSA, CAB International, Academic OneFile, Biological Abstracts, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, CSA Environmental Sciences, Current Contents/Life Sciences, and Elsevier Biobase. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 2.848.

He is also an author and journalist, with many charity commitments focused on HIV/AIDS. Early life and education Jeremy Gordon Norman was born in Marylebone, London in 1947. His father was Wing Commander Roland Frank Holdway Norman and his mother was Mrs John Sim (N√©e Peggy, daughter of Percy Johnson). He was educated at Harrow School and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he graduated with his MA in 1976. After Cambridge Norman became a self-employed entrepreneur and has continued to be so ever since. Career He became involved in 1974 in Burke's Peerage a genealogical reference publisher through a school friend, Hugh Montgomery- Massingberd, editor at the time. Other directors included Patrick, Earl of Lichfield and John Brooke-Little, Richmond Herald of Arms. In 1984, Burke's Peerage decided to separate its titles and sell their copyright: Burke‚Äôs Peerage was acquired by Frederik Jan Gustav Floris, Baron van Pallandt (1934‚Äì94) whilst Burke‚Äôs Landed Gentry and other titles were sold elsewhere. Burke‚Äôs Peerage was then bought by Joseph Goldberg, who reprinted the immediate previous edition. Norman's first nightclub was The Embassy in Old Bond Street, \\"London's first modern New York-style nightclub ‚Ä¶ attracted many celebrities\\". Other directors were Michael Fish (sixties fashion designer) and Derek Johns (old master picture dealer and director of Sotheby's, 1968). Norman sold The Embassy to Lady Edith Foxwell. Meanwhile, he created an entirely new form of club, the ultradisco Heaven, in Charing Cross in 1979, which \\"quickly established itself as the centre of London gay nightlife\\" and soon became Europe's largest and \\"the world's most famous gay nightclub\\". Norman's partner, Derek Frost, designed the \\"original hi-tech interior\\". Heaven introduced a new music style, Hi-NRG. After four years Norman sold the club to Richard Branson of Virgin. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s Norman was the originator of two other successful clubs: Embargo (1990‚Äì94) embargorepublica.com and Leopard Lounge on Fulham Broadway (1989‚Äì92). Norman's other businesses included La Reserve wines in 1974 with his brother, and Pasta Pasta, a manufacturer and retailer of fresh pasta and sauces, with Derek Johns in 1984. Norman's pro bono and charity appointments focused on HIV/AIDS. He was the founding chairman of Crusaid in 1985, Trustee of the National AIDS Trust in 1986 and the founding Trustee of Aids Ark. Norman was also a Trustee of the University Pitt Club, Cambridge, from 1994 to 2009. In 1983 Norman and Richard Branson were partners in Norman's first gym, Power Station, in Chelsea (1983‚Äì89). He was founder and Chairman of Ovalhouse Ltd., trading as Soho Gyms 1994 - 2018, a chain of ten gyms located mainly in central London, sold to Pure Gym in June 2018. He also owns real property investment companies Blakenhall & Co Ltd and Citychance Ltd. Norman described encounters and experiences from his life in his autobiography No Make-up: Straight Tales from a Queer Life. The Times journalist Matthew Parris described it as \\"A marvellous book. Startlingly candid, unblushingly funny about wealth, privilege and the pursuit of fun. Mr Norman ... paints an unforgettable picture of gay life in an age of official prohibition.\\" Norman has been in a relationship with his partner Derek Frost since 1978 and they became civil partners on 21 December 2006, the first day it became legal in the United Kingdom to do so. They currently reside in Malta. Norman has recently entered the field of journalism with pieces in the Sunday Times, the Spectator and the Times of Malta. His articles discuss food, politics, gay themes and reveal insights from the extensive travel he has taken with Frost. Norman has also written books published about their adventures aboard a private yacht from the perspective of the couple as and an alternative about his perspective, \\"Two Men in a Boat\\". The first, Two Men in a Boat: Chasing Spring was inspired by a quote Norman once heard: \\"Spring travels up through Britain at the pace of a walking man. (This) struck Norman as an intensely romantic notion, and, along with his partner Derek Frost, he set out to find the proof\\" which led them on a journey, chasing spring up the west coast of the British Isles. Two Men in a Boat: Illyrian Shores, is a ‚Äústory of a romantic voyage in the wake of the Venetians ‚Ä¶ from Cofu to Venice‚Äù. These trips were recorded both in Norman's books as well as a 25-part TV series, under the same title, which documented their extraordinary odysseys and is narrated by the presenters, Jeremy and Derek, and their expert guests about the history, archaeology, art, natural history and the landscape of the many places they visit. The article The First Emperor of China Destroys Most Records of the Past Along with 460, or More, Scholars.

He is first mentioned following the Muslim conquest of the island of Crete in the mid-820s. At the time, he was military governor (strategos) of the Anatolic Theme, and was entrusted by Emperor Michael II the Amorian (reigned 820‚Äì829) with recovering the island. Upon his request, he was later reinforced with troops under the protospatharios Damian. Both were defeated by the Arabs, however: Damian fell, and Photeinos was barely able to escape with his life. Despite this failure, he was soon entrusted with another important mission, being sent to Sicily as its strategos to counter the rebellion and defection of the local tourmarches Euphemius to the Aghlabids of Ifriqiya. He was probably the successor of the strategos Constantine Soudas, whom Euphemius had killed, but some scholars equate the two men. Greek historian Christos Makrypoulias on the other hand estimates that this is highly unlikely, and that he must have been appointed strategos in Sicily before the expedition to Crete. Nothing is known of him after his dispatch to the island. Photeinos was also the great-grandfather of Zoe Karbonopsina, the fourth wife of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912).

First published in 1857 by John Churchill & Sons, it was republished and updated in 1870. Content In the book Acton professed to desiring to \\"heal the sick prostitute and to cleanse her moral nature\\". The book was republished in 1870 and updated by Acton, in which he drew upon the scandal of the Contagious Diseases Acts of the 1860s to \\"reinforce his dire warnings about the ubiquitous threat of unregulated and avaricious prostitutes\\". Controversy Controversial, it raised considerable attention for its commentary on society in mid 19th century London and concerns among the wider population that the city was the centre of moral decay in Britain and was infested with diseased prostitutes. One author stated that Acton's book demonstrated a \\"very swift decline and ultimate total loss of health, modesty and temporal posterity\\". While Acton meant to expose the profession as a risky one healthwise for both for prostitutes and clients alike, and as an immoral practice, many considered that Acton humanized prostitutes by denouncing low wages for women as one of the reasons why they would turn to prostitution. This was in contrast to the dominant perception among members of the middle and upper classes that women decided to become prostitutes because of an innate lustfulness and sinful nature. Acton concluded that \\"Vanity, giddiness, greediness, love of dress, distress, hunger, marke women prostitutes, but not general sensuality.\\" In popular culture In the 1981 film The French Lieutenant's Woman, Meryl Streep's character references commentary from the book, and mentioned that according to Acton's report, the Lancet estimated that in 1857 there were 80,000 prostitutes in the County of London and that one house in 60 functioned as a brothel.

The creek has a 400-acre reservoir, which is known as the Pikes Creek Reservoir and supplies water to tens of thousands of people. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek. Course Pikes Creek begins in a pond or small lake in Lake Township. It flows southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning south-southeast, east, and then south. The creek then turns southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning south for more than a mile, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 29 and through the community of Pikes Creek and crossing Pennsylvania Route 118. At the southern end of the community, the creek receives Fades Creek, its only named tributary, from the right. Pikes Creek then turns west-southwest for a short distance before turning south, exiting Pikes Creek and Lake Township and entering Lehman Township. After some distance, the creek turns east-southeast, flowing away from Pennsylvania Route 29, and enters the Pikes Creek Reservoir after more than a mile. At the southwestern edge of the reservoir, the creek turns southeast for several hundred feet before turning east along the border between Jackson Township and Plymouth Township. After several tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with Harveys Creek. Pikes Creek joins Harveys Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology At the border between Lake Township and Lehman Township, the peak annual discharge of Pikes Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 845 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 1508 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 1868 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 2927 cubic feet per second. Upstream of the tributary Fades Creek, the peak annual discharge of Pikes Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 556 cubic feet per second.

The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 1986 cubic feet per second. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Pikes Creek is between above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is approximately above sea level. Pikes Creek flows through a manmade concrete flume for part of its length. A layer of alluvium with a thickness of occurs in the valley of Pikes Creek. It contains stratified sand, silt, and gravel. Wisconsinan Outwash, which consists of stratified sand and gravel, also occurs in the creek's valley. There are large piles of drift in the creek's valley and Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift occurs with a thickness of more than at the community of Pikes Creek. This drift also occurs near the creek's headwaters. Glacial or resedimented tills such as Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Till also occur in the creek's vicinity, as does a rock quarry pit. Bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale occur in the area as well. Watershed The watershed of Pikes Creek has an area of . At least part of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Harveys Lake. The portion of the watershed that is upstream of Fades Creek has an area of . The watershed of Pikes Creek, along with that of Harveys Creek, is used as a water supply by Pennsylvania American Water Company Ceasetown. The creeks supply part or all of 15 communities: Ashley, Courtdale, Edwardsville, Mocanaqua, Larksville, Plymouth, Pringle, Shickshinny, West Nanticoke, Nanticoke, Wilkes-Barre, Hanover Township, Hunlock Township, Plymouth Township, Newport Township, and Wilkes-Barre Township. The water company serves 67,500 people and is allowed to withdraw 16 million gallons per day from the watersheds. A dammed 400-acre lake known as Pikes Creek Reservoir is situated on Pikes Creek. The lake is mainly used for water supply. The lake is private property. The dam, which is known as the Pikes Creek Dam, is high. Pikes Creek is entirely on private land. However, 50 percent of this land is accessible to the public. Pikes Creek, along with Beaver Run, Fades Creek, and Harveys Creek, is one of the main sources of flooding in Lake Township. However, these creeks' floods have not caused extensive damage, since Lake Township is relatively undeveloped. History and recreation Pikes Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1183731. The creek is also known as Pike Creek. This name appears on certain topographic maps of the United States Geological Survey. Daniel Lee settled near the headwaters of Pike Creek in 1806. In 1860, Otis Allen constructed a mill on the creek in Lake Township. A steel stringer bridge carrying T-676/East Salt Road was constructed over Pikes Creek in 1926. It is long and is situated near Pennsylvania Route 29. A concrete slab bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 29 was built over the creek in 1927 and repaired in 1980. It is long and is situated in Lehman Township. A concrete tee beam bridge was constructed over the creek in 1932 in Lake Township. It is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 29. Another concrete slab bridge was built over the creek in 1935 in Lake Township. It carries Pennsylvania Route 118 and is long. Pikes Creek flows alongside the northern side of Moon Lake County Park for a portion of its length. Shoreline fishing is permitted along some areas of the Pikes Creek Reservoir, though boating, ice fishing, swimming, and wading are not allowed. Biology The drainage basin of Pikes Creek is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout and brown trout from its headwaters downstream to the uppermost arm of the Pikes Creek Reservoir. Fifteen species of fish, including largemouth bass, yellow perch, bluegills, and black crappies are found in the reservoir.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The building was commissioned to replace an earlier timber-framed town hall in Lichfield Street. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Edward Pugh, treasurer of the local board of health, on 2 April 1872. The new building, which was designed by architects Bidlake and Lovatt of Wolverhampton in the Classical style and built by a Mr Nelson from Dudley at a cost of ¬£6,000, was officially opened on 14 June 1873. An extension incorporating a larger free library and a new reading room in the same architectural style as the original building was added in 1880. The ball room on the first floor was, in 1910, leased to Joseph Woods as a cinema: after he built Wood's Palace, on the other side of the road, the ballroom reverted to community use. The town hall became the meeting place of Bilston Urban District Council in 1894 and of the Bilston Municipal Borough Council in 1933. The Princess Royal visited Bilston Town Hall in 1946 shortly after the Second World War. The town hall ceased to be the local seat of government when Bilston was incorporated into the new county Borough of Wolverhampton in 1966. However, the town hall continued to be used by the housing department of Wolverhampton Metropolitan Borough Council for another 30 years until it closed in 1996. In April 2005, work started on a refurbishment programme for the building involving restoration of the grand ballroom for use by the Gazebo Theatre Company, new offices for Wolverhampton Homes, repairs to the roof, stonework, windows and clock and a new glass entrance. The venue also took possession of a newly restored pipe organ, designed and built by John Compton, which had been removed from the Lyric Cinema in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire when it changed ownership in the late 1960s and had instead been installed at Weavers Road School in Wellingborough. Although it had been used for concerts at the school in the 1980s, it had subsequently languished in the school for many years until it was acquired for Bilston Town Hall in 2007. Following the completion of the works, which cost ¬£2.5 million, the town hall was officially reopened by Councillor Christine Mills, the Mayor of Wolverhampton, on 19 September 2008. In 2013 the town hall also became the central hub of \\"Talent Match Black Country\\", an organisation which provides support to young unemployed people in the local area.

The piece was commissioned by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and premiered November 24, 2003, with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra led by the conductors Mariss Jansons, Lucas Richman, and Edward Cumming. Style and composition The piece has a duration of roughly twenty minutes and is divided into two movements: #Past #Future To perform Time Machine, a standard symphony orchestra must be divided into three separate ensembles and led by three conductors simultaneously. Rhythm, tempo, and time signature are frequently juxtaposed between the three ensembles, resulting in often antiphonal and polymetric sounds. Daugherty described the piece in the score program note, writing: In a pre-premiere interview about the piece, Daugherty convivially added, \\"It is not a particularly practical idea. I saw it as a challenge. Part of being new is to look at musical expression and to discover new things. Part of what avant-garde music is all about is doing something you are not supposed to do ‚Äî forbidden music.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored an orchestra comprising for four flutes (fourth doubling piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, three clarinets (third doubling E-flat clarinet), bass clarinet, four bassoons (fourth doubling contrabassoon), four French horns, four trumpets, three trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, five percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception Alex Chilvers of Limelight called Time Machine \\"an interesting concept\\" and \\"dramatic and never dull.\\" Mark Estren of The Washington Post praised the work as \\"blar[ing] along just wonderfully, from a sonic point of view, providing an effective contrast between 'Past' and 'Future'.\\" Discography A recording of Time Machine was released January 4, 2011, through Naxos Records on a compilation album also featuring Daugherty's other orchestral works Route 66, Ghost Ranch, and Sunset Strip.

It is the 2015 and 2016 entry in the Power Rangers franchise. The show follows the Power Rangers Tyler Navarro (Brennan Mejia), Shelby Watkins (Camille Hyde), Koda the caveman (Yoshi Sudarso), Riley Griffin (Michael Taber), and Chase Randall (James Davies) who protect the Earth from the evil alien bounty hunter, Sledge, who seeks the Energems to become invincible. The Power Rangers are later joined by the medieval knight Sir Ivan of Zandar (Davi Santos), his modern liege Prince Phillip III (Jarred Blakiston), their own tech expert Kendall Morgan (Claire Blackwelder), Tyler's long lost father James (Reuben Turner, Dan Musgrove), and Keeper's apprentice Zenowing who also become Power Rangers to stop Sledge, only to find his former prisoner Heckyl (Ryan Carter) has transformed into the more powerful evil alien Snide and he now wants to finish what Sledge has started and take over the Earth. Dino Charge Power Rangers Based at the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum in the city of Amber Beach, the Dino Charge Rangers' arsenal revolves around being powered by the Energems, ten items of great power. As the spirits of dinosaurs that Keeper initially entrusted the Energems to have bonded into them, they manifest as Zords that the Dino Charge Rangers use to fight enlarged monsters. Having only five Energems, the Power Rangers' mission is to find the remaining five before their enemies do.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 1, \\"Powers From the Past\\", Original Airdate: February 7, 2015 As the series progresses, the Power Rangers successfully obtain five more Energems, thus completing 10 Energems. =Tyler Navarro= Tyler Navarro is the enthusiastic and adventurous leader of the Dino Charge Power Rangers. He works as a chef at the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum's restaurant, the Dino Bite Cafe. He has been searching for his father who mysteriously disappeared ten years ago while at an archaeological dig site. His father had left Tyler a journal that had a sketch of a monster (Fury) whom Tyler has been seeking for clues of his father's disappearance. His search ultimately leads him to a cave where he finds the Red Energem in a Tyrannosaurus fossil, and he becomes the Dino Charge Red Ranger after he saves Shelby from the evil monster Iceage. Tyler is very outgoing, gregarious and affectionate, nicknaming his T-Rex Zord \\"Rexy\\". He is also fond of taking selfies. When he finds his dad, Tyler works with him to defeat Ninja and then helps him get the crack in his Red Energem sealed. He goes on two adventures: one to find the Silver Energem and then to the monsters base. As the Dino Charge Red Ranger, Tyler commands the T-Rex Zord that forms the main body of nearly all of the Dino Charge Megazord formations, as well as combining with the Plesio Zord alongside Pachy Zord into Plesio Charge Megazord Pachy-Rex Formation. Tyler Navarro is portrayed by Brennan Mejia.Power Rangers Dino Charge cast and staff credits Mejia was a fan of Power Rangers going in to the show, particularly Power Rangers Time Force. He, and other members of the cast, were all surprised by the producers when they did a cold read of the script and were instructed to open up treasure chests as part of the reading, inside of which contained their official new role. He previously auditioned for Power Rangers Samurai and also tried out for the Blue and Green Ranger roles in Dino Charge as part of the audition process. Before working on Power Rangers, he worked as an acrobat at the San Diego Zoo. Mejia spoke in interviews of how he and the other cast members trained with Japanese stunt actors from the Super Sentai shows to prepare for action scenes. He also joked of how he and the other cast members became accustomed to wearing their signature colors offset. =Shelby Watkins= Shelby Watkins is a clumsy, slightly ditzy girl who works as a waitress at the Dino Bite Cafe inside the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum. Shelby has a vast knowledge of dinosaurs with her favorite being the Triceratops. When she stows away in the back of one of the museum's trucks heading for a dig site, she spots the Pink Energem being stolen by the monster Iceage. She takes it from him, and it chooses her to become the Dino Charge Pink Ranger. Shelby develops a crush on Tyler. As the Dino Charge Pink Ranger, Shelby can command the Tricera Zord that forms the left arm of the Dino Charge Megazord.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 3, \\"A Fool's Hour\\", Original Airdate: February 21, 2015 Shelby Watkins is portrayed by Camille Hyde. Hyde is the first African-American woman to portray a Pink Power Ranger. Hyde felt that her part in Dino Charge would become a part of the long legacy of Power Rangers by continuing with the dinosaur theme. She also remarked that being able to stay on her feet was one of the hardest parts of the physical training as part of the role and was just as surprised as her castmates when she was given the role at what they thought was their final audition. Prior to the show, Hyde was a student at Chapman University, majoring in policy and environmental science. She left her studies early in order to go to an audition. In an interview, she mentioned the camaraderie she felt from the actresses who portrayed the Yellow and Pink Rangers in Power Rangers Megaforce, who wrote to her to ask if she was feeling alright when she began filming in New Zealand for the first time. She also spoke of how the young fans have treated her when they realize who she is, bringing up a time she was recognized by two little boys in a pizzeria in her hometown of Washington, D.C.. The Shelby Watkins character has been described as a \\"stubborn tomboy\\". In her role, Hyde wears a stretchy pink body suit, matching helmet, and battles an evil alien named Sledge. While filming in New Zealand, Hyde received martial arts training and continued to pursue her academics through online courses. Hyde attributed her success to her determination to stay focused and to acting courses she took at Chapman University. Hyde considered herself a tomboy growing up and never wore pink, but now that she had been filming as Shelby for a year, she began to wear more pink outside of the role. =Koda= Koda is a Cro-Magnon caveman who found the Blue Energem a hundred thousand years ago in a Stegosaurus fossil and used its powers to save his little brother from a Smilodon attack. However, he fell off a cliff and ended up frozen in a glacier, but the Energem's powers kept him from dying. He is unfrozen in modern times upon being found by Kendall and Chase, ultimately becoming the Dino Charge Blue Ranger alongside the others (making him the oldest Power Ranger ever), using his extraordinary strength and sharp reflexes and senses to help in fights. He now works for the Amber Beach Museum as a digger on paleontological expeditions and as a dishwasher for the Dino Bite Cafe while he tries to adapt to modern customs and technology. Koda speaks in broken, minimalist sentences as he is still learning the English language. Over time, he comes to see the other Dino Charge Rangers as not just his friends but as his family. He is also the only Ranger whom Kendall allows to address her by her given name.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 2, \\"Past, Present and Fusion\\", Original Airdate: February 14, 2015 As the Dino Charge Blue Ranger, taking advantage of his superhuman strength in a fight, he commands the Stego Zord that forms the right arm of the Dino Charge Megazord. In Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel, Sledge and his crew are not the only ones who return, Koda also appeared in the episode \\"Dimensions in Danger\\" and is among the legendary Rangers that help the Ninja Steel Rangers against Lord Draven. Koda appeared in the Super Ninja Steel Christmas special \\"The Poisy Show\\" when he finds out Sledge and his minions are still alive in another world after Preston is accidentally transported here. With his help, the Rangers leave a time bomb which destroys Sledge, Poisandra, Wrench, and the Warrior Dome ship for good. Koda is portrayed by Yoshi Sudarso. He also portrayed Joseph \\"Joe\\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger and Hyperforce Green Ranger in Power Rangers Hyperforce. Sudarso has been a fan of Power Rangers since a child and also enjoyed Time Force. On auditioning for the role, he said that he had known it was a caveman and had used a particular speech pattern when auditioning, but he was thrown off by the cold read on the day that he was given the role. Sudarso is also a fan of the Japanese television series Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger on which Dino Charge was based. He hooked Brennan Mejia on the show as well, leading the two of them and fellow cast member James Davies to leave their own ad libbed references to the show that made it into the final cut. =Riley Griffin= Riley Griffin is the youngest member of the Dino Charge Power Rangers: a cool-headed 17 year old. Before moving to Amber Beach, he lived on a farm with his mother and older brother, Matt. One day, he found the Green Energem in a Velociraptor fossil and was then suddenly attacked by Fury before the Energem turned him into the Dino Charge Green Ranger. He has since moved to Amber Beach and is a summer intern at the museum where he works as a waiter at the Dino Bite Cafe. Riley is calm, sensible and intellectual. He is rather regimental in his demeanour but over time learns to be able to relax. As the Dino Charge Green Ranger, Riley is an expert swordsman who uses a backhanded grip in battle and commands the Raptor Zord. It has a sword for a tail and it forms the Dino Charge Megazord/Ptera Charge Megazord's left arm for the Para-Raptor formation.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 5, \\"Breaking Black\\", Original Airdate: March 7, 2015 Riley Griffin is portrayed by Michael Taber. In an interview, Taber brought up how the production team tricked them all at the final cold read audition, and how they had not heard from the producers in over a month when they were all finally called in again. When asked about his favorite episode, he said it was one that had not yet aired when the interview was held at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con, but aside from that one it was when his character became a Power Ranger in the second episode. =Chase Randall= Chase Randall is a laid-back and flirtatious young man from New Zealand who is skilled at riding a skateboard around. Prior to meeting the other Rangers, he received the Black Energem as a reward from the MƒÅori fortune-teller Moana after he saved her cat. Chase works at the Amber Beach Museum as a janitor and is an expert paleontology digger. Chase also has a younger sister Chloe back in New Zealand. Chase is second-in-command of the team as he usually takes charge of leadership in Tyler's absence.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 15, \\"Rise of a Ranger\\", Original Airdate: October 24, 2015 As the Dino Charge Black Ranger, Chase is skilled at firearm-based combat, and he commands the Para Zord. It has a rifle for a tail and forms the Dino Charge Megazord/Ptera Charge Megazord's right arm for the Para-Raptor formation. Chase Randall is portrayed by James Davies. When interviewed about the audition process, Davies said that the last fake-out audition was the worst for him because he was so nervous about the cold reading. During filming, he enjoyed learning how to do tricks with the blaster prop, as his character was skilled with its use. =Sir Ivan of Zandar= Sir Ivan of Zandar is a medieval knight who served the royal family of the small country of Zandar some 800 years ago. When escorting Zandar's Prince Colin through the woods, he came upon the Gold Energem in a lake when he was suddenly attacked by Fury. The two fought, and the Energem chose him as its bearer, but Fury, out of pure frustration, absorbed Ivan into his body and kept him prisoner, while the Gold Energem was lost in the fight. In the modern day, Fury finds the Gold Energem once more and uses Ivan still trapped within him to summon the Ptera Zord, but this gave Ivan the chance to escape and become the Dino Charge Gold Ranger.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 11, \\"Break Out\\", Original Airdate: September 12, 2015 He initially chooses not team up with the Power Rangers as he did not consider them a worthy enough team after some of them had their courage stolen by Bones, but he eventually joins them when they save him from Bones. Ivan is very kind, brave and humble. Though he does not understand many modern day customs, he is honest and loyal to a fault. He speaks in an English accent and uses many archaic phrases, continually clashing with today's culture. For example, he refers to the male Rangers with the honorific \\"Sir\\" and the female Rangers with \\"Lady\\".Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 12, \\"Knight After Knights\\", Original Airdate: September 19, 2015 It is revealed that Ivan has a descendant named Zach, as Ivan had a family back in his time before he found the Gold Energem. As the Dino Charge Gold Ranger, he uses the unique wrist worn Gold Ptera Morpher, wields a sword in battle called the Gold Ptera Saber, and commands the Ptera Zord, which can transform into Ptera Charge Megazord. Sir Ivan shares the same name with the first Power Rangers movie villain, Ivan Ooze. Sir Ivan is portrayed by Davi Santos. In interviews, Brennan Mejia (Tyler) and Camille Hyde (Shelby) spoke about how difficult it was to keep the secret of Santos' appearance in the show until after his character's debut. They and the other cast members would regularly take photos to post to Power Rangers social media and would have to keep him out of the shot, and then they would take another photo with him in the group. =Albert Smith= Albert Smith is an explorer and Bigfoot hunter from New Zealand who runs a tourist spot in the woods. A year ago, he found the Purple Energem and was chosen by it to become the Dino Charge Purple Ranger after he saved a little girl who was lost in the mountains during a blizzard. After fighting Iceage and Stingrage, Keeper helps him retire as a Power Ranger due to his unwillingness to leave his home country of New Zealand, and his bond to the Purple Energem is severed. Despite his age, Albert is energetic. He used his Purple Energem to perform simple good deeds around the city of Auckland like stopping criminals but was never really adept at fighting monsters. However, he is still a warm-hearted man who is willing to help other people. Albert is portrayed by Arthur Ranford. =Kendall Morgan= Kendall Morgan is a 26-year- old scientist who manages the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum and is the head of its paleontology digging group. Prior to the start of the television series, Kendall met Keeper while she was digging for fossils, and she promised him that she would help him find the Energems. She used her position as a scientist at the museum to set up an underground research lab where she built the various gadgets, robots and weapons for the yet-to-be-chosen Dino Charge Power Rangers. After the Purple Energem is stolen by Sledge and Keeper is kidnapped, Kendall goes to rescue him on her own. Once she finds him, the Purple Energem bonds with her making her the new Dino Charge Purple Ranger.Power Rangers Dino Charge, Episode 20, \\"One More Energem\\", Original Airdate: November 28, 2015 (France: September 16, 2015) Kendall is confident, direct and rarely gets emotional. She is very blunt with her words and gets easily impatient. She often insists that the Rangers address her by \\"Miss Morgan\\" and not by her first name, though she does allow Koda to call her \\"Kendall\\". Though she may not always show it, Kendall clearly cares about the other Rangers and is invaluable as their technical advisor. As the Dino Charge Purple Ranger, Kendall commands the Plesio Zord, which can transform into Plesio Charge Megazord. Kendall Morgan is portrayed by Claire Blackwelder. =James Navarro= James Navarro is Tyler's long lost father. He was thought to have died in a cave-in when fighting Fury ten years earlier. When he risked his life to save his friend Rusty, he instead discovered and bonded to the Aqua Energem which prevented him from aging. He first appears as the Dino Charge Aqua Ranger to save Tyler from Ninja. When Singe's virus drives Tyler's T-Rex Supercharge Mode to make Tyler act like a Tyrannosaurus, Chase gets help from James to cure Tyler. When he is saved, James reveals who he is, breaking Tyler free from the virus. Then they help the other Power Rangers fight Ninja.Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, Episode 5, \\"Roar of the Red Ranger\\", Original Airdate: February 27, 2016 After the Rangers defeat Hunter, James leaves on an archaeological dig to use his geological expertise to find the Silver Energem which is now the team's top priority. James and Tyler take one photo of each other before going their separate ways. When they learn where the Titano Zord is and where the Silver Energem is, he goes to look for the monster's base.Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, Episode 6, \\"Forged Under Fire\\", Original Airdate: March 6, 2016 As the Dino Charge Aqua Ranger, James commands the Ankylo Zord. James Navarro is portrayed by Reuben Turner and is voiced by Dan Musgrove. =Zenowing= Zenowing is an Archaeopteryx-themed alien who was Keeper's apprentice. After a failed fight when he bonded with the Silver Energem with Lord Arcanon, his hand was forcefully placed on the Dark Energem which caused him to develop his Doomwing side that was loyal to Lord Arcanon. Arriving on Earth, the Rangers encounter Zenowing in the McCadden Forest only to find that Doomwing is in control of his body. Zenowing regained control of his body and explained his past while stating that Doomwing has the Silver Energem in his sword. Doomwing then took control of Zenowing's body again and attacked the Rangers before fleeing. After Keeper heard about what had happened with Zenowing, the Rangers pretend to not know that Doomwing and Wrench are listening in so that they can come up with a plan to separate Zenowing and Doomwing as part of an ambush.

It is revealed Sledge has indeed survived and discovered Greenzilla's eggs. He had hatched a new plan by faking his own death to get the Rangers off his track and could not risk of telling his crew about his plan because they would blab it to the Rangers.

Curio's final fate is never seen on screen. He wasn't seen in the final episode, but he was somewhere on Sledge's ship and sucked into the black hole caused by the destroyed Dark Energem alongside Sledge's crew. After the Dino Charge Rangers travel to the past when Sledge first arrived on Earth, Curio didn't appear because Sledge didn't order Wrench to create him. For unknown reasons, the version of Curio that was sucked into the black hole didn't appear in Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel, he was on the Warrior Dome Ship after Sledge salvaged it and was destroyed offscreen. Curio was revived by Venjix/Evox and Scrozzle before he is killed for a final time by Beast Morphers Rangers.

He becomes one of Sledge's prisoners who was locked in solitary confinement and is chosen by Sledge to help him obtain the Purple Energem. In exchange, Heckyl demands that he become Sledge's partner in ruling the universe together. However, Fury steals the Purple Energem first, leading to Heckyl being double-crossed and thrown back in his cell. After Sledge's spaceship crashes on Earth, Heckyl escapes from his cell and transforms into Snide who proclaims he will now try to take over the Earth. After asserting his authority over the remaining monsters on Sledge's ship by slaying a Spikeball and an unnamed outlaw to serve as a warning to them, Heckyl sets out to obtain the Power Rangers' Energems by infiltrating the Power Rangers, getting a job at the museum where they all work. Snide refers to the Energems as the key to his \\"past, present, and future.\\" When Snide is not in control of Heckyl's body, Snide speaks to him through Heckyl's pocket watch; a similar ornament on Snide's sword allows Heckyl to speak to him when their positions are reversed. Snide and Heckyl have clashing personalities, but Snide can only maintain control of their body for a limited time. This led to complications in one of Heckyl's plans to find the Rangers' lair, in which he managed to succeed, only for him and his minions to have their short term memory erased due to Curio's bungling. During the plot by the monster, Nightmare, Shelby finds Heckyl using one of Nightmare's pillows on the others. After destroying it, Shelby reveals Heckyl's true intentions and claims that Heckyl is working for Snide. Heckyl states that he doesn't work for Snide as he transforms into Snide, stating that he is Snide. Before escaping, Snide states that his group will find their lair soon. As they continue their efforts to claim the Energems, their group is unexpectedly joined by Singe, whom Heckyl takes a liking to, but Snide mistrusts. When Lord Arcanon comes to Earth, Heckyl is re-incarcerated in his cell following Fortress's destruction. As part of a deal with Poisandra, Heckyl would tell Poisandra a secret. Upon receiving an explosive that blew up the door to his cell, Heckyl makes his way to where Lord Arcanon and Singe have gotten the Dark Energem. Upon recalling his past, Heckyl gets angry and lashes out at Lord Arcanon for what he did to Sentai 6, only for him to be restrained by Singe. Lord Arcanon tells Singe to have Heckyl shackled. Snide offers his plan to Lord Arcanon to use Professor Strickler, Game Face, and Nightmare. He and Heckyl are separated by Wrench who uses the split-emitters. After Heckyl escapes, Snide reminds Poisandra and Curio about the information that he told him. Following Lord Arcanon's defeat, Snide sides with Sledge who has been manipulating him to temporarily take command of his crew while he's away, as he obliterates Lord Arcanon, Singe, Conductro, and Screech. While Heckyl works to enjoy the \\"End of the World,\\" Snide figures out that Sledge is going to get rid of him. Snide traces the destroyed Greenzilla egg to the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum where he finds the Power Rangers' base as he prepares to attack Kendall and Keeper. Snide then starts wrecking the base as Kendall tries to fight him. In the nick of time, Heckyl shows up and fights Snide who makes his way outside. The rest of the Rangers arrive at the junkyard and assist Kendall and Heckyl in fighting Snide. As Sledge doesn't want to fire the Magnabeam on him, Snide angrily curses Sledge with hatred. The Rangers use the Titano Zord's Titano Cannon and their lasers to kill Snide before he can get his revenge on Sledge. Heckyl then offers to let him help the Rangers destroy the Dark Energem.

Lord Arcanon Lord Arcanon is a multi-faced Statue of Liberty-themed intergalactic warlord who is power-hungry, ruthless, calculating, and is the one Singe actually works for. Millions of years ago, he went off to search for the Energems on the planet Sentai 6, before destroying it in the process. He was the one who forced Zenowing's hand to touch the Dark Energem, which resulted in the creation of his Doomwing side and was unintentionally responsible for Snide's creation. At some point, Lord Arcanon sent his minion Singe to infiltrate Heckyl's group and to keep him posted on Heckyl's activities. He was also revealed to be Sledge's employer who ordered him to capture outlaws to create an army to rule the universe. Lord Arcanon arrives on Earth with Singe and Doomwing in order to get the bounties Sledge was supposed to bring to him. After Fortress is defeated, Lord Arcanon has Singe and Doomwing capture Heckyl, and they lock him up. Singe tells Fury, Poisandra, Wrench, and Curio that they now work for Lord Arcanon. When Singe asks about the Rangers, Lord Arcanon says that they won't have a problem as he has a special book with him. Using the Dark Energem that was in his book, Lord Arcanon gets stronger upon assuming a green-faced appearance and getting enlarged by the Magnabeam. He gives the Dino Charge Ultrazord a hard time before being defeated by the Ultra Plasma Beam Final Blast. Crawling through the forest to the Dark Energem, he is confronted by Sledge where Lord Arcanon is pleased to see his old friend. Sledge states that they aren't friends, and he has been collecting bounties for him for millennia. When Lord Arcanon plans to give him the bullion that he promised, Sledge takes the Dark Energem instead. As Singe, Conductro, and Screech go to Lord Arcanon's aid, Sledge is joined by Poisandra, Fury, Wrench, Curio, and Snide as Sledge uses the Dark Energem to power his laser gun enough to obliterate Lord Arcanon and his group.

He is very boastful and proud which leads to him forming a rivalry with Fury. Singe is revealed to be working as a double agent for Lord Arcanon.Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, Episode 8, \\"Riches and Rags\\", Original Airdate: March 26, 2016 After Heckyl gets suspicious about Singe knowing the location of the Titano Zord, Singe leaves, stating that he wouldn't want to anger his master. Singe then retreats back to Lord Arcanon. Some time later, Singe returns with Lord Arcanon and Doomwing. After Fortress is destroyed, Singe assists Lord Arcanon in re- incarcerating Heckyl and then tells Fury, Poisandra, Wrench, and Curio that they now work for Lord Arcanon. During Zenowing's fight with Doomwing, Singe finds the Dark Energem and gives it to Lord Arcanon. Upon Sledge's return, Singe, alongside Lord Arcanon, Conductro, and Screech, are obliterated by Sledge's laser gun which is powered by the Dark Energem. Singe is voiced by Mark Mitchinson. Doomwing Doomwing is an Archaeopteryx-themed alien who is the evil half of Zenowing. He is the result of Lord Arcanon forcing Zenowing's hand to touch the Dark Energem. Because he is Zenowing's negative counterpart, he has stored the Silver Energem in the tip of his sword in order to access the Silver Ranger powers for evil purposes. He is cocky, arrogant, manipulative (when taking on the form of the Silver Ranger), and overly proud of his worth. When he was posing as the Silver Ranger, he tricked Kendall and the rangers into giving out information of their technology to him. He was shown to have created the Dino Chargers for Lord Arcanon to access the Zords and Megazord combinations. Arriving on Earth, the Rangers encounter Zenowing in the McCadden Forest only to find that Doomwing is in control of his body. Zenowing regains control of his body and explains his past while stating that Doomwing has the Silver Energem in his sword. Doomwing then takes control of Zenowing's body again and attacks the Rangers before fleeing. Doomwing places a listening device on the Rangers as they plan to separate Zenowing and Doomwing. He and Wrench are unaware that the Rangers have figured out that the Rangers are onto them as they plan an ambush. When it comes to the next encounter at McCadden Forest, the Rangers work to get Doomwing into the Split Emitters by the ambush. When Doomwing arrives to fight Tyler, they transform as Tyler works to wear down Doomwing as Zenowing starts to take control of his body. Once the Split Emitters are activated, Doomwing is separated from Zenowing as Lord Arcanon uses the Magnabeam on Doomwing. The Dino Charge Ultrazord is formed, and it uses its Titano Cannon Final Strike to defeat Doomwing who gets away. Because Doomwing is separated from Zenowing, he is unable to transform into the Silver Ranger, and Lord Arcanon loses faith in Doomwing. Lord Arcanon gives Doomwing a second chance upon being told of his plans to merge with Zenowing. Upon confronting Zenowing and the Rangers with Lord Arcanon and Fury present, Doomwing engages Zenowing again as he claims that he is Zenowing's destiny. Before Doomwing can finish off Zenowing, Riley uses his sword to block Doomwing's attack. Doomwing then defeats Riley. Keeper arrives and teleports himself and the Rangers away. Doomwing is told by Lord Arcanon to capture Zenowing or else he will destroy him and claim the Silver Energem from his ashes. By his next plot, Doomwing has Wrench revive Iceage, Scrapper, Slammer, Puzzler, Stingrage, Duplicon, Bones, Gold Digger, Shearfear, Meteor, Ninja, and Hunter in order to keep the Rangers busy. The sped-up revival done by Doomwing and Wrench renders the monsters unable to speak. While the monsters fight the Rangers, Zenowing is ambushed by Doomwing and Lord Arcanon. Upon the Rangers arriving after destroying most of the monsters, Doomwing is left to fight the Rangers. Tyler then confronts Doomwing while the others fight the remaining monsters. As Doomwing prepares to defeat Tyler, he is caught by surprise when Tyler assumes his T-Rex Super Charge Ankylo-Pachy formation as Doomwing summons Iceage, Stingrage, and Meteor as Zenowing arrives.

Both farms, whose complexes stand roughy opposite each other on Ludlow Road northwest of the town center, were established in the mid-19th century, and substantially modernized in the early 20th century. As examples of the changing agricultural trends of Aroostook County, they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Donovan Farm The Donovan Farm stands on the south side of Ludlow Road. The farmstead is a connected complex with an east-facing main house joined to a three-story gambrel-roofed barn by a long single-story ell extending to the south. The barn's main entrance faces north, with a secondary entrance to the basement on the east. The house built c. 1845 by Michael Donovan, an Irish immigrant, whose landholdings exceeded , including the Hussey Farm property. Donovan worked the farm as a dairy operation, an industry which began to decline in the area in the 1920s. The original Donovan barn was destroyed by fire in 1920, as was its replacement just eighteen months later. Donovan's son built a new barn oriented toward potato farming, and also updated the house from its original Cape configuration into a Dutch Colonial. The farm originally had several other outbuildings, including a potato house and a hog or chicken house, but these have been torn down. Hussey Farm The Hussey Farm stands on the north side of Ludlow Road, with a connected farmstead including the main house, barn, and milk house. Other outbuildings on the property include an equipment shed near the house, and a wood frame structure used as a recreational camp at the edge of woods to the north. The original Donovan farm property was divided in 1893 by his sons Timothy and John, with the latter taking ownership of the northern section. John Donovan lived in a house that was located west of the present farmstead. In 1912 he sold the property to Joseph Hussey, who grew up nearby, and it was Hussey who built the present American Foursquare house around that time. The barn, like that on the Donovan farm a three-story gambrel-roofed structure, appears to have been built earlier; the date \\"1906\\" is incised on one of its beams. Unlike the Donovan barn, this one is organized for dairy operations.

Senior Lecturer at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. In his works, Kashi raises issues that deals with painting in the contemporary era. Kashi's art has been exhibited in Israel and worldwide. He won the Young Artist Award (1994), Artistic Achievement Award (1997) and Ministry of Education (Israel) Culture and Sport Prize (2004). Kashi is a contemporary pantheist that his painting study field is based on views and imagery from nature. His paintings include fields, trees and entanglement, landscape and wide open space that try to express a place of which time stops, which is timeless and space less. Kashi's paintings are not created as a single painting but are created as a series of paintings. Every painting stands by itself and in every series there's a slow and research like attendance of the chosen subject. This kind of method of work allows Kashi to investigate, analyze and accuracy. \\"Kashi's works demand active, prolonged observation to gradually decipher the painter's interpretation of the subject. the works dictate the time they require. Each work invites the viewer to set an inner clock while observing it. The slow viewing process also contains an element of surprise. Kashi's works invoke contemplations; they raise doubts and quandaries, without providing answers. They strive to sharpen attention, to indicate the possibilities of the gaze, to unravel thought without stitching it together again. Making innovative, fascinating use of traditional painting techniques, Kashi does not give up the act of painting, but his work draws on insights that derive from the experience and thinking of modern and contemporary art. The poetic and metaphorical value carried by the painting alludes, on the one hand, to Mark Rothko's color fields, and on the other‚Äîto Gerhard Richter's work. The painting is thus charged with layers of time and place beyond the here-and-now\\". Ruthi ofek \\"Infinite Painterly Landscapes\\" \\"Kashi's paintings carry within them the anxiety of an encounter with the \\"sensitive viewer\\" signaled in the mid-20th century by Mark Rothko, the viewer whose gaze and insights seal a painting's fate: if the experience does not enchant him, if the dark shimmering tones fail to claim his attention, he may be astounded by the painting's technical virtuosity but will not emotionally enter Kashi's core preoccupation with landscape spaces that hedge in a dense, velvety darkness. As in the paintings of the German painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840), which contemplate the mystery of the universe through moonlight and the mist of a wide sea, Kashi too, albeit neither wearing the monk's robe, nor invigorated by religious belief, gazes directly at the enigma of light and dark, growth and withering.Bygone centuries have not weakened the experience but honed its reception.\\" Tali Tamir, 'A Captive Darkness; on the work of Mosh Kashi' Biography =Early life and education= Kashi was born in 1966 in Jerusalem to an eight-person family. His father Efraim Kashi was a construction worker employed by Solel Boneh, and participated for years in building the Israel Museum. At age 13 Kashi was sent to boarding school in the Ben Shemen Youth Village. These years later produced the series of painting \\"Cronos\\", and there he painted wide fields, dark and black from one side to the other. The loneliness, the difference and the feeling of a luck of home in his period of studding in the boarding school, sharpen the idea of the \\"Non Places\\" that later appeared as an repeating motto in his works that mainly shows fields, night vegetation, thorns and trees floating from grasping in the ground, as well as his three-dimensional balls painted in entanglement till the last detail, and in 2000 also the porcelain gold balls scattered all over the gallery space. Between the years 1984‚Äì1987, Kashi studied in The School of Art ‚Äì HaMidrasha,http://embassies.gov.il/london/culture/IsraeliCulture/Education/Art/Pages/The- School-of-Art-%E2%80%93-Hamidrasha.aspx Between the years 1998‚Äì2000, Kashi completed his studies for his master's degree in art and education at Bretton Hall College of Education in Leeds, UK. =Career= Kashi first exhibited in 1992, that year he won the America-Israel Cultural Foundation Prize for a young artist.

The projector operated automatically with a universal electrical motor, capable of varying speeds. It used a powerful 1500 watt light bulb to display nimbus and cumulus clouds. The clouds were images on a strip of negatives that moved continuously in front of the light. The negatives were affixed to a circular disc that rotated once every 105 minutes‚Äîabout the length of a typical performance.

A national and an international firm, the company has a particular focus on computer Internet law and patent prosecution for small businesses. As of 2010, the firm has served over 20,000 clients. In the burgeoning area of domain name law and litigation, Lieberman is recognized as one of the top three legal experts in the world. Lieberman is regarded as being on the forefront of litigation relating to reverse domain hijacking as well as domain names and trademarks in dispute. Through his law firm, Lieberman has testified to Congress See Testimony to Congressional Budget Office on June 21, 2000 while also listing as a colleague John B. Anderson, who was a 10-term Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives. Career As part of Greenberg & Lieberman, Lieberman and Greenberg have filed almost 300 trademarks and over 560 patent files as of September 2011. One of his earliest cases was a successful motion to dismiss copyright infringement suit based on lack of personal jurisdiction in Evan K. Aidman v. Mark S. Nelson in 1999. In September 1999 he was involved in a motion to dismiss patent infringement matter in Molnlycke Health Care AB v. Dumex Medical Surgical, a notable case in Internet law. In 2000 he was involved in a trademark infringement matter in the National Jewish Defense League (JDL) v. Mordechai Levy case which ended in November 2002 when JDL chairman Irv Rubin died in suspicious circumstances in jail, and defended against copyright infringement in the Studio Martis, B.V. v. Joseph D. Wager Smith case. In 2001 he was involved in a trademark matter concerning Apache Boats v. Mark McManus and made a motion to dismiss in the Ramfan Corporation v. Super Vacuum Manufacturing case. In 2002, Lieberman's involvement in the Ramsey v. Schutt, et al. in the Maryland State Circuit Court for Charles County was influential in changing the rule in Maryland pertaining to what is necessary in a contract to obviate liability. In 2003, Lieberman was involved in several UDRP or trademark infringement disputes, and the following year, the firm continued to represent Future Media Architects and Internet Development Corporation in a series of disputes over UDRP and trademark infringements and other matters. In 2005, Lieberman was involved in the federal court and mediation in the Ariadne Genomics v. Stratagene California dispute. He was hired by Mastercard International Incorporated v. Priceless.com to settle a trademark matter. The firm also represented clients in several UDRP cases such as EuroChannel, Inc. v. Mrs. Jello and RCS Recover Services v. John Laxton RL.COM, a case which is still ongoing as of September 2011. In 2006, Lieberman represented H2Ocean against Schmitt, April's After-Care and April's Attic in a case which was settled and was involved in UDRP disputes such as Equifax, inc v. The Tidewinds Group, Inc., Marchex v. Name Development Corp. and Thomas Weisel Partners Group, Inc. v. Tom Weisel House of Entertainment. In 2007, Greenberg & Lieberman were hired by businessman Antonis Polemitis in a case against Ville de Paris, a Municipal Corporation of the city of Paris at the Virginia Eastern District Court involving the Lanham Act in which the client claimed tortious interference with contract and defamation. They also represented some major global firms in trademark matters such as Nike, Inc. v. Niyad Enterprise in California Central District Court, Microsoft v. Domain Source, Inc. and UDRP cases involving firms such as HSBC Finance Corp. and Payday America, Inc.. In 2008, Lieberman was involved in a trademark/domain matter between Air China and Airchina.com and with LG Electronics USA and LG.com. He was also hired in a Second Life case between Chris Mead and Jakob Hyvarinen and in the UDRP cases of Blue Magic, Inc. v. Johns Creak Software Inc. and Genzyme Corporation v. Abadaba S.A.. In 2009 he was again hired by Abadaba in a trademark matter against Microsoft and by the Broward Rehab Center Inc. against Rafael Foss. Lieberman also represented dentist Alex McMillan IV v. Tom Winkler case in a dispute over cybersquatting. The Alexandria Circuit Court ruled in favor of their client McMillan in a case which involved \\"a legal action initiated against a former employee charged with trademark infringement, trade secret violations, and domain theft.\\" Lieberman has said, \\"2009 was most definitely an interesting year. We saw a large number of corporations, Verizon, Microsoft & Costco to just mention a few, taking the scorched earth point of view and suing everyone they can, even individuals and entities that no longer owned the alleged infringing domain names. This of course led to a large number of confidential settlements, which it can be assumed, were all rather painful to those paying to end the law suits.\\" In 2010, Lieberman was involved in copyright cases in the John M. Smith vs Gosmile, Inc. dispute (settled), and began representing the Second Life firm Amaretto Ranch Breedables, LLC v. Ozimals, Inc. in a copyright infringement case in California Northern District Court, overlooked by judge Charles R. Breyer. As of October 2011, the Amaretto case is still ongoing. He was also active in the Warren Weitzman v. Lead Networks trademark case and was hired by The ERGO Baby, Inc. v. Amaya Lucy in a UDRP case.

In April 2011, Lieberman lost a case representing Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld of the Modern Orthodox Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue in northwest Washington when U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan denied the request of the rabbi to have an upcoming local election rescheduled because it conflicted with the Jewish Passover. =Virtual World contribution= Lieberman is credited for being among the first lawyers in the world to begin generating a significant revenue and client base via online virtual worlds such as Second Life. For example, through the Washington, DC- based law firm of Greenberg & Lieberman, CNN has cited him as \\"among the virtual world's earning elite.\\" In 2007 CNN reported that the American Bar Association and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are among the organizations seeking assistance and legal guidance from Lieberman on issues relating to business practices in virtual worlds.CNN/ Business 2.0 report by Michael Copeland as reported July 4, 2007 He is a regular lecturer for the Montgomery County Bar Association on intellectual property issues. He has said, \\"IP law is extraordinarily complicated and a 3-D image helps people to reach out and touch items so that they can understand my explanations. Second Life makes people feel as if they have physically met one another. In addition, its interactive capabilities help users, particularly lawyers, to clarify difficult concepts. Second Life is not another world; it is an extension of real life.\\" Lieberman assumes the name of \\"Navets Potato\\" (Navets is Stevan spelled backwards) in Second Life and has multiple avatars, one which resembles himself and some six others as of 2007, based on what he wants to accomplish.

After working with Mike Curb, Kim Fowley and others in the mid-to-late 1960s on musical projects including the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, and Steven Spielberg's first short film, Amblin, he became a producer of such teen idol pop stars as the Osmonds, Shaun Cassidy and Leif Garrett in the 1970s. During the 1980s, Lloyd supervised the music soundtrack for the movie Dirty Dancing, including production of the hit \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\", and worked with Belinda Carlisle, Barry Manilow and many others. By his own account, Lloyd has earned over 100 gold and platinum records. Early life and musical career Born in New York City, Lloyd learned classical piano and guitar as a child. By the age of 13, he had formed his own band at Beverly Hills High School, at the same time continuing to take lessons in music theory and composition. He also started writing songs and pitching them to record labels in Los Angeles, including Tower Records, a subsidiary of Capitol. By Lloyd's own account, Eddie Ray, the head of A&R; at Tower, suggested that the teenage Lloyd work with Mike Curb, and the pair began collaborating on songs and record production.

With Fowley's support and Markley's financial backing, Lloyd became a member of the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band with the Harris brothers, Markley and drummer John Ware, releasing an album, Part One, in 1967. Fowley also released some of the Laughing Wind's demos, with other tracks featuring Markley, as Volume One, credited to the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band.

The 1970s By late 1969, Mike Curb had become president of MGM Records, and appointed Lloyd, then aged 20, as vice-president in charge of A&R.; Among the artists Lloyd signed to the label was Lou Rawls, whose 1971 hit single and album, A Natural Man, he produced. As Curb purged the label of artists associated with drug use, Lloyd moved into more mainstream pop music, initially as the producer of several of the Osmonds' hits, including \\"Down by the Lazy River\\" and \\"Crazy Horses\\" in 1972. He also wrote and produced tracks on Donny Osmond's solo album Portrait of Donny, as well as later singles and albums by Donny and Marie, the Osmonds, and Engelbert Humperdinck. Lloyd later said: > \\"A publisher had a song he wanted Lou Rawls to sing. I could sign acts at > MGM. Lou had been dropped by Capitol Records already and his career was > over.

The Lakeview companies own and/or manage over 50 hotel properties in Canada and the United States. Levit built the first phase of the Winnipeg Walkway between Lakeview Square and the Winnipeg Convention Centre. Today, the city has continued this skywalk system to connect much of downtown Winnipeg. Early life Levit, the son of an Eastern European Jewish businessman, became a successful entrepreneur and corporate executive largely as a result of a number of financial decisions. Born in 1921, Levit gained business experience from working with his father, William Levit, in the company that his father founded after arriving in Winnipeg in 1921. William Levit, like many others of Jewish heritage in Europe in the early part of the 20th century, fled from Europe during a period of anti-Semitism and moved to the Canadian prairie. A commercial artist by trade, William Levit formed the Levit Sign Co., which became the largest neon sign business in Canada.http://www.jewishfoundation.org/bookoflife3.cfm?id=557 His son Jack Levit extended the family sign business into a property development and management company under the names of Lakeview Development Inc. and Lakeview Hotel Management Inc. Business career = Levit Sign Company = In 1964, Levit sold the Levit Sign Company for C$600,000 (approximately $4 million, in today's dollar). He built two industrial buildings for his family sign business, both of which were funded from profits realized in the sign business. While in the sign business, Levit had to approach land owners for permission him to erect signs on their property. In the process, he frequently had to agree that if the land where the sign was eventually sold, his sign would have to come down. He constructed a number of warehouses in a then underdeveloped, peripheral area of the city‚Äîthe St. James Street area, which now is a retail area of Winnipeg. The land that he proposed developing was not for sale, but was vacant. Unable to purchase the property outright, he negotiated a 50-year lease on the property. The original St. James development project was funded by a mortgage and three partners, each holding a 25% interest. The project called for Levit to receive a 10% development fee that would constitute his 25% equity. He used the $600,000 profit from the sale of the family business as security for bank loans required to sustain the project's development. The project was developed under the corporate name, \\"Lakeview.\\" Lakeview developed the initial warehouses with the intention of adding them to the company's management portfolio. The warehouses proved successful and the rents from the units allowed Levit to pay the company's ongoing overhead while continuing to focus on subsequent developments. Throughout Levit's career, he decided to sell certain properties and continue to manage other if he believed they made sense financially to keep within Lakeview's real estate portfolio. As a result, Lakeview evolved into both a development company and a property management company. The development business was the more profitable one. = The Courts of St. James = Shortly after his warehouse development was completed, he developed a three high-rise apartment complex containing 756 apartments, a shopping centre with multiple retail outlets and Canada's first tunnel system that linked the units of the complex. The project was called The Courts of St. James. In order to acquire the land, he had to persuade dozens of individual land-owners to sell their property to him. In order to finance the project, Levit approached several potential lenders and eventually secured financing from Confederation Life, a Canadian insurance company headquartered in Toronto. Confederation Life agreed to finance the project with a C$16,000,000 mortgage and agreed to pay Lakeview a C$50,000 development fee for each building and providing Lakeview with a 50% ownership stake after the mortgage was retired. Levit later acquired of all the individual residential properties on the city block. A few years after the project was completed, the Canadian Government imposed regulatory restrictions on the ability of Life Insurance companies to be involved in private equity projects. Confederation Life subsequently bought all of Lakeview's ownership stake in the project, converting Levit's equity to cash. = Lakeview Square = After his deal with Confederation Life, Levit began working on a new project, the Lakeview Square development in Downtown Winnipeg. This comprised two large office towers, two 27-story apartment buildings, a four-star hotel and an underground parkade. The anchor tenant to the 400-room hotel was to be a Holiday Inn; the two apartment towers included 500 apartments, and the courtyard to be developed in the centre of the building complex included a conversion of the existing Japanese-themed park to a Japanese Hyashi garden. To finance this deal, Holiday Inn arranged a mortgage. The zoning regulations were waived following his agreement with the City of Winnipeg that he would build a Skywalk to connect office buildings, apartments and hotels to the new Winnipeg Convention Centre. = Grand Winnipeg Airport Hotel = Levit was also responsible for developing the Grand Winnipeg Airport Hotel, which is the only hotel across from Winnipeg's Richardson International Airport.

Background The song is composed by Pritam marking his first collaboration with Dharma Productions. The music for the song is composed by Pritam, marking his first venture as a composer in a Dharma Productions. Pritam and Ranbir Kapoor had earlier collaborated in films like Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010) and Barfi! (2012). On 31 July 2012, reports suggested that Mohit Chauhan will be lending his voice for a song that features Kapoor, whom he had previously dubbed in Rockstar (2011) and Barfi! (2012). The original version which is sung by Arijit Singh is composed with heightened tempo and the musical arrangements are slightly different within the two versions. Apart from the song \\"Ilahi\\", Singh recorded two other tracks for the album of the film, \\"Dilliwaali Girlfriend\\" along with Sunidhi Chauhan and Kabira alongside Harshdeep Kaur. In the film, Kapoor portrayed a character named Bunny, whose dream is to wander and explore the world. The song is picturised as how Bunny works as a videographer for a travel show and travels the world, as he had planned. Kapoor had earlier worked with Ayan Mukerji in 2009 Bollywood film, Wake Up Sid. The lyrics of the song which is penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya mainly focuses on the unconstrained and carefree attitude of the protagonist who is filled with life.

The EAA incorporates almost 3,000 square kilometers (1,158 square miles) of highly productive agricultural land. The EAA was established by the State Legislature as a special district representing landowners within the EAA Basin for the purposes of ensuring environmental protection. Means include conducting scientific research on environmental matters related to air and water and land management practices and implementing the financing, construction, and operation of works and facilities designed to prevent, control, abate or correct environmental problems and improve the environmental quality of air and water resources. History The Everglades Agricultural Area was designated by the Central and Southern Florida Project (C&SF; Project) in 1948. The C&SF; established 470,000 acres (1,900 km2) for the Everglades Agricultural Area‚Äî27 percent of the Everglades prior to development.Lodge, Thomas E. (2005). The Everglades Handbook. Understanding the Ecosystem. CRC Press. Sugar farming Approximately 500,000 acres of the 700,000 acres of the EAA is controlled by sugar companies, namely U.S. Sugar and Florida Crystals. In late 2008, a land deal was in the works as U.S. Sugar offered to sell the US government just under 180,000 acres of land at $1.75 billion. The deal was repeatedly downsized until the South Florida Water Management District eventually rejected the deal in 2010.  Reservoir project  Three above ground reservoirs are being built by the South Florida Water Management District as part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, including the A-1 parcel of the Everglades Agricultural Area. Construction of the reservoir was halted in 2009 during the negotiation of the failed U.S. Sugar land acquisition deal, after US taxpayers had already invested almost $250 million. In the summer of 2016, much of South Florida's waterways experienced massive toxic algae blooms caused by the discharge of billions of gallons of freshwater from Lake Okeechobee. Following the crisis, much public support was aroused pressuring the construction of the EAA to be moved ahead.

Plot  Five red-dressed cheerful gnomes come out of their houses singing a song praising the Sun while marching up the hill. They go inside and bottle sunlight into a special milk. One of the gnomes rides a cart pulled by a cricket and sings a song and puts the bottles by the door and takes the scroll. A grumpy blue-dressed top-hat-wearing goblin shoots the hat off the gnome with a bow and arrow and the hat flies to a tree. Another arrow flies over the gnome's head, and the gnome throws a bottle at the goblin, who ends up having sunshine on his back and runs back home to the goblin swamp. At the dark swamp, a small group of goblins sing a gloomy song \\"We're happy when we're sad. We're always feeling sad.\\" An owl alerts the goblins of the incoming danger of sunlight and the goblins run into their houses. The afflicted goblin buries his shirt in the ground and bangs on a gong. The goblins get sprayers to erase the sunshine's power outside the swamp with toxins. One of the gnomes toots a horn and the rest of the gnomes use bottles to shoot them through a cannon at the goblins. The milk bottles fly everywhere, a vulture turns into a jay, and the goblins run to their houses. The gnomes on dragonflies drop bottles and make a fountain of water that brightens up the goblins' swamp. The gnomes struggle to get the goblins into the fountain, with one protesting \\"I don't wanna be happy.

According to local religious beliefs, the Krishnashila Idol of the Lord Bala Gopalkrishna, having the features of a child, which was worshipped by Lord Krishna's foster mother Yashoda, is believed to have been presented by the almighty Lord Krishna himself to the sage Kanva Maharshi in Dvapara Yuga, who in turn installed the same at its present location where the temple exists. Historical records state that in the 10th Century, the Temple was renovated by King Jayasimha of Kadamba Danasty, whose capital was Kumbla and even the administration of his Kingdom was being done in the name of Kanipura Sri Gopalkrishna. The coronation of Kumbla Rajas was being solemnized at Kanipura Sri Gopalkrishna Temple. It is stated that Sri Gopalkrishna Temple has the sanctity of over three Yugas of Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. The temple was established by Maharshi Kanwa. Believers ascribe to the temple the same sanctity and holiness as that of Sri Krishna Temple at Guruvayoor and also to that of Sri Krishna Temple situated at Udupi in Karnataka. Several Lakhs of Devotees offer prayers at the Temple regularly. Priests of this temple belong to the Kota Brahmin community. History Kanipura Temple was the original seat of the Raja of Kumbla, which was later on shifted to Maipady (Mayapuri). Even to this day one can see the ruins of the fort at Kumbla or Kotekar and Arikadi, which bears testimony to the political importance of Kumbla in the days gone by. Kanipura is only a derivative of Kanvapura. Tradition ascribes the Prathishtah of Sri Gopalkrishna Moorthi of the temple to Kanva Maharshi form whom the name of the place is derived. The other place names such as Kannur (also called Kanva Peetah) within two miles to the east of the temple and the well known Kanva Teertha of the Pejavar Mutt fame near Manjeshwar, also are indicative of the faith of the people in the many legends relating to the association of the sage Kanva with this temple and the place around if. The legend of the Sthala-Purana states that having installed the idol, which is an image of Balagopalakrishna in jet black granite, an idol which was being worshipped by the fostermother Yashoda, the sage performed Adhishekam to the deity with the Manthrodaka which he had saved in his Kamandalu during ages past; the Manthrodaka then flowed out as a stream, grew into a river and ultimately joined the western sea within a short distance form the temple. The river is \\"Kumbha Hole\\", (Hole means river) also known as the Kumbhini. The town as well came to be known as Kumbla form this. The temple, for which extensive repairs and renovations have been carried out, is situated in the heart of the town of Kumbla at the foot of an elevated hill which rises in front of it, with the river Kumbha Hole flanking if on the north. If Srimadanantheshwara, and Sri Vinayaka of Madhur are the deities of the daily worship of the senior Raja of Kumbla, the patta Abhisheka or coronation of the senior Raja would in ancient days take place in Kanipura Sri Gopalakrishna temple. The Abhisheka of the Yuvaraja of Kumbla used to take place at Srimath Udaneshwara Temple of perdala, which in Kumbla Seema is only next in importance to the above four temples. Kanipura Sri Gopalakrishna's praises have been sung by Parthi Subba, the father of Yakshagana, along with those of Madhur Sri Mahaganapathi, in several songs. It was in Kumbla that Parthi Subba was born and bred up (in about 1740 to 1800 A.D) and composed all his yakshagana prasangas which earned for him the title of the father of Thenkku Thittu Yakshagana. He was in the line of the Paatalies of the Kumbla temple, and at the Moodappa seva in Madhur temple in 1797 had presented a copper \\"Dhara Battal\\" to that temple inscribed with his name in Kannada, which is presently in use at the Madhur temple. Festivals The festival at the Kumbla temple which lasts five days every year commences with Dhwaja Arohanam on the Makara Sankramana day every year. The festival comes to an end with the idol coming back after being dipped in the pond about three kilometers from the temple premises and the holy flag (Kodi) coming down. Popularly known as ‚Äò‚ÄôKumble Bedi‚Äô‚Äô, because of the display of crackers done in front of the idol. The idol is sat on the Banyan tree platform and the display extends to almost one and half hours. People from different parts of north Kerala and South Canara assemble for the festival. ‚Äô‚ÄôBali‚Äô‚Äô is the typical way of carrying the idol overhead of a poojary. Who goes around the temple with the idol decorated with flower and ornaments which is never to be too light. The poojary moves as per the taala of chendamelam and vadyam. First he moves with one of his hands supporting the idol on his head and the other hand swinging. In the end he removes the support and moves quickly around the temple. In the Media The temple was in the news in 2012 when the temple was facing a threat of extinction. Situated at a narrow place in between the Arabian Sea and the Temple, the National Highway Authorities decided to demolish the temple. Protesting the NHAI's move, on 24 January 2012 pro-Hindu organisations demonstrated a massive rally in Kasaragod city. There was a march organised which began from Kumble ended at Kasaragod, over one lakh public from Kasaragod participated in this protest. Sri Pejawar Vishweshwara Swamiji of Udupi, Sri Delampady Balakrishna Tantri of Agalpady, several other socio- religious leaders, Subbayya Shetty, Convenor of Temple conservation committee, IUML MLA's N.A.Nellikkunnu and PB Abdul Razak, BJP leaders Surendran, Ramesh and others headed the protest rally.

The film received one Oscar nomination, for Best Original Song, and one Emmy nomination for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking. Racing Extinction premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, followed by limited theater release, with worldwide broadcast premiere on The Discovery Channel in 220 countries or territories on December 2, 2015. Racing Extinction‚Ä≤s website details further information about contemporary extinction and campaigns with which to prevent them. The film was created by the Oceanic Preservation Society. Synopsis The film deals with several examples of the overarching theme of the Anthropocene Extinction, in that the spread of Homo sapiens has caused the greatest mass extinction since the KT event 66 million years ago, including global warming and poaching, and the efforts of scientists, photographers and volunteers to protect endangered species. The film implicates overpopulation, globalisation and animal agriculture as leading causes of extinction. The film deals with the illegal wildlife trade, including the filmmakers exposing a whale meat restaurant in the US (on the same day Louie Psihoyos was originally planning to collect his Academy Award for The Cove) and covert undercover investigations of the shark fin and Manta ray gill trade in Hong Kong and mainland China for traditional medicines. The film also documents successful efforts to include manta rays on the CITES Appendix II list of protected species, thus stopping the village of Lamakera on Solor in Indonesia from killing them to supply demand in China. The film refers to the Baiji and the Hawai ªi  ª≈ç ª≈ç as recent examples of extinction (although both of these species are still believed by some to be extant), and identifies the Amphibian extinction crisis, the overfishing of sharks for shark fin soup and as bycatch, among others, as current causes for concern. More specific examples include the imminent extinctions of the Florida grasshopper sparrow and Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog (the last individual of which, Toughie, Joel Sartore photographs). Anthropogenic global warming from greenhouse gas emissions is identified as a leading cause of extinction, as organisms cannot adapt to unprecedented changes in not only temperature, but weather, ocean chemistry and atmospheric composition. The film focuses on the amount of methane produced by livestock, particularly cattle, and trapped methane escaping from frozen reservoirs in the Arctic, the latter drawing parallels to the runaway greenhouse effect that may have caused the Permian mass extinction that wiped out 95% of species. Carbon dioxide and methane emissions from transportation, animals and factories are made visible to the human eye for the first time with a specially designed high definition FLIR (forward looking infra red) camera, with a special color filter. Ocean acidification and the subsequent degradation of corals and other calcium carbonate-based marine organisms are revealed with lab experiments and comparisons of archived photographs to the state of the same reefs in the 2010s. The degradation of marine ecosystems and the implications of coastal habitations are highlighted. The filmmakers also work with Obscura Digital to design a custom Tesla Model S fitted with a 15,000 lumen projector system to project images of critically endangered and extinct species onto public buildings including Shell factories, Wall Street, Headquarters of the United Nations, the Empire State Building and the Vatican. They go visit the village Lamakera, Indonesia in order to convince the village to stop fishing manta rays. As well as the greenhouse gas camera previously mentioned and the projector, it is also the first car in the world with electro-luminescent paint, inspired by bioluminescent organisms, and projects endangered animal sounds from the Bioacoustics Research Program. This campaign aimed to raise awareness and encourage people to change habits to ensure the survival of species for future generations, further highlighted with the 'Start With One Thing' Campaign. Cast Several notable persons had an appearance in this film, including: * Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk * National Geographic photographer Joel Sartore, founder of The Photo Ark project * Primatologist Jane Goodall * Author and columnist Elizabeth Kolbert * Professor Stuart Pimm * Christopher W. Clark (director of the Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP)) * Race car driver and environmentalist Leilani M√ºnter * Artist Shawn Heinrichs * Conservationist and Photographer Paul Hilton Obscura Digital customized the Tesla Model S car used for the projections. Reception Racing Extinction was generally acclaimed by critics. The film is nominated for an Emmy Award for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking. The film holds a Metacritic score of 81/100. It was also praised as a \\"return to form\\" for the Discovery Channel, in that it represented a break from the numerous pseudoscience-based mockumentaries that the network was airing at the time. Soundtrack A soundtrack was released via Rumor Mill Records on November 6, 2015. The main theme of the documentary is a song called \\"One Candle\\" featuring the vocals of Australian singer-songwriter, Sia. To promote this track, a music video was created using images of animals projected onto the side of the Empire State Building in New York. At the 88th Academy Awards, \\"Manta Ray\\" by J. Ralph & Anohni was nominated for Best Original Song. Other nominees competing in this category were \\"Earned It\\" from Fifty Shades of Grey, \\"Til It Happens to You\\" from The Hunting Ground, \\"Simple Song #3\\" from Youth, and \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" from Spectre. \\"Writing's On the Wall\\", by Sam Smith, was the winner.

Facts A testator gave ¬£12,000 in a codicil to five people on trust, saying they should invest using their discretion and ‚Äòto apply the income.... for the purposes indicated by me to them.‚Äô Four were told the general objects, and the fifth got detailed instructions. All accepted. The fifth also made a memorandum of the testator‚Äôs instructions, but a few hours after the codicil was executed. The residuary legatees claimed that any trust was invalid, because parol evidence was inadmissible to establish the testator‚Äôs purposes. Eve J held the evidence was admissible. Court of Appeal agreed with Eve J, so there was a valid secret trust. Judgment The House of Lords held that the secret trust was valid, because the details were laid out around the same time as the execution of the codicil to the will.

He was born in Shotley Bridge, County Durham, and raised in Ebchester. Blues & Soul has described Laddie as \\"the most exciting young blues player of the current bunch and probably the only serious prospect for major global success this country has produced in several decades\\". His 2012 full-length album Burning Bridges also won Blues & Soul's \\"Album Of The Year\\". Early life Mitchell Thomas Laddie was born on 24 September 1990 in Shotley Bridge, County Durham, England, and grew up in Ebchester, County Durham. He is of Irish descent. Influenced by his Grandfather's love of music and his parents' record collection, which heavily included blues and prog rock, Laddie was drawn to music from an early age. Growing up in a house full of guitars, he became fascinated with the instrument and often picked up and played with his Father's Stratocaster. At the age of five, he discovered Motown music and was later influenced by artists such as Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. After a sporting injury at the age of 13, Laddie was hospitalised for several months. It was during this time he began playing guitar seriously, influenced by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry and Dave Gilmour. Upon discovering Stevie Ray Vaughan his love of Blues music was rekindled, leading to heavy influence from Albert King, BB King, Walter Trout and Vaughan. He formed his first band, Vanilla Moon at the age of 14 with school friends. During his mid-teens, Laddie's influences began to expand into Jazz, Soul, Funk and Fusion, from artists such as Kenny Burrell, Miles Davis, James Brown, Prince, D'Angelo, Eric Johnson and Robben Ford. Career =Early career - This Time Around (2006-2010)= Laddie met Blues guitarist and idol Walter Trout at the age of 15, and was asked to join the guitarist on stage the following year. This led to further appearances around the UK and in the Netherlands. It was during a performance with Trout at the Paradiso (Amsterdam) that landed him his first recording contract with Provogue Records at the age of 17. Laddie's debut album This Time Around was recorded in 2009, produced by Laddie and released in 2010 on Mascot Label Group, gaining positive critical response from Classic Rock Magazine and receiving airplay on various radio stations, including BBC Radio 2. The album was promoted with a UK and European tour with Walter Trout Band. =Burning Bridges (2011-2013)= Laddie later moved to UK-based Mystic Records, and his follow-up album Burning Bridges was recorded in 2011 and released in 2012, again produced by Laddie. The album was received to critical acclaim, gaining heavy press coverage from Classic Rock Magazine, Blues & Soul, R2 (Rock'n'Reel) & Blues Matters! as well as coverage on various radio stations. Laddie also recorded a live session at Maida Vale for BBC Radio 2. The album was later voted joint Album of the Year by Blues & Soul in 2012, tied with Tedeschi Trucks Band. The album was promoted with various UK and European tours, alongside Johnny Winter, Royal Southern Brotherhood and Walter Trout. =Live In Concert & Mitch Laddie Band (2013-2014)= Laddie revamped his band line-up in late 2012 and later branded himself as Mitch Laddie Band in 2013. The band's first move was to give in to fan demand and release a Live album. Live In Concert was recorded on 13 September 2013 at The Cluny, Newcastle-upon-Tyne to a sell out show and released in early 2014. The album featured new tracks \\"Linger\\" & \\"Open Your Eyes (Take It Back)\\" which became tracks on the band's next studio album. Mitch Laddie Band played Royal Albert Hall in 2014 as part of \\"BluesFest.\\" =Let You Go (2015-present)= In 2015, Mitch Laddie broke away from Mystic Records and formed Independent record label \\"MLBP\\" and began work on his third studio album, \\"Let You Go\\" with Mitch Laddie Band. MLB set a goal to write, record, engineer and produce an album on their own with no outside influence. The album was recorded over the period of 4 months at the band's personal studios in County Durham, UK. The album was independently released under the MLBP label in September 2015 and was praised for the band's songwriting, production and change of direction, citing a Soul and R&B; influence. \\"Classic Rock: The Blues\\" magazine saying \\"It's time to get funky as this Blues Man becomes a Soul brother\\" & \\"Blues Rock Review\\" saying \\"Once you listen to Let You Go, you will understand why The Mitch Laddie Band are popular in the UK.

Betawi cuisine is rich, diverse and eclectic, in part because the Betawi people that create them were composed from numbers of regional immigrants that came from various places in the archipelago, as well as Chinese, Indian, Arab, and European traders, visitors and immigrants that were attracted to the port city of Batavia (today modern Jakarta) since centuries ago. History and influences Kerak telor vendor selling spicy coconut omelette, a popular delicacy during Jakarta Fair. The Betawi cuisine developed and evolved with influences from various cuisine traditions brought by waves of newcomers to the port-city on the north coast of Western Java. From the small port of Sunda Kalapa, it grew into an active hub of international trade, primarily involving Indonesian, Chinese, Indian and Arab traders. By early 16th century, drawn by the spice trade, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive, followed by the Dutch later in the same century. During colonial VOC era, foreign communities were kept in enclaves under Dutch colonial rule, as the result the culinary concentration grew in each area: Tanah Abang for Arab cuisine, the Glodok and Kuningan area for Chinese food and Tugu in North Jakarta for Portuguese. Betawi cuisine is in fact really similar to Peranakan cuisine, as both are hybrid cuisine heavily influenced by Chinese and Malay, as well as Arab and European cuisine, to neighboring Sundanese and Javanese cuisine. Nasi uduk for example, which is a savory rice cooked in coconut milk and served with several side dishes, may be a local version of the Malay dish nasi lemak. On the other hand, asinan, cured and brined pickled vegetables, and rujak juhi, vegetables served with shredded dried squid and peanut sauce, demonstrate Chinese influences. Because of this common heritage, some of Betawi cuisines, such as asinan and lontong cap go meh, are shared with Chinese Indonesian. Betawi cuisine also shares some recipes and dishes with neighboring Sundanese, such as both of them are familiar with sayur asem, gado-gado (lotek) and semur jengkol. Another examples are nasi kebuli and soto betawi that uses minyak samin (ghee), which indicates Arab or Muslim Indian influences. A gastronomy expert suggests that some Betawi dishes can describes the past condition of Betawi people reside in Batavia. For example, kerak telor was created due to the low quality of local glutinous rice, with the egg and other toppings added to make it more tasty and satisfying. Soto tangkar, which today is a meat soup, was mostly made from the broth of goat rib-cage bones in the past because meat was expensive, or the common population of Batavia were too poor to afford some meat back then.Suryatini N. Ganie Today, many authentic Betawi dishes are hard to find even in its native land. This is partly because as a cosmopolitan city, Jakarta also features dishes from many far-flung parts of Indonesia, as well as international cuisines ‚Äî which is a myriad dishes for Betawi cuisine to compete with. Moreover, Betawi community were pushed out of the inner city to the marginal suburbs in and around Greater Jakarta in the wave of development. Nevertheless, some Betawi restaurants are striving to preserve their heritage cuisine, such as rare gabus pucung, and pecak gabus, snakehead fish (Channa striata) in pecak sauce. Ingredients and cooking method nasi goreng kambing (fried rice with goat meat) in bulk in Kebon Sirih area, Central Jakarta. Betawi cuisine uses rice as staples, numbers of its dishes are revolved around rice, either steamed, cooked in coconut milk as nasi uduk (coconut rice), or compressed as ketupat sayur or lontong sayur rice cakes in vegetables soup. As a Muslim-majority community, Betawi people favour beef, mutton and goat meat, as they adhere to Islamic halal dietary-law which forbid pork consumption. Fishes are consumed too. Unusual for a coastal city, there are hardly any seafood dishes in Betawi cuisine. But there are plenty of freshwater fish dishes, using local varieties of snakehead fish and carp. Popular Betawi dishes include soto betawi (beef offals in milky broth), sayur asem (sweet and sour vegetable soup), sop iga sapi (beef rib soup) and kerak telor (spiced coconut omelette). Most of Betawi dishes are cooked in deep- fried, stir-fried, barbecued or braised methods, and feature a delicate balance of sweet, sour and salty flavours. Dishes Ketoprak street vendor in Jakarta.

In addition, radar towers are used for the installation and operation of search and height finder radars at military radar stations where the mission is to support air defense missions. These missions were characterized as Aircraft Control & Warning (AC&W;) or Long Range Surveillance in support of the Semi-automatic Ground Environment (SAGE). The tower typically has a continuously rotating parabolic antenna. Often the antenna is protected from the weather by a radome and is thus not visible from the outside. For regional air traffic control, en route radar installations are used; for example there are six of these in Germany, erected at selected sites. The data from these radars is fed into the civilian RADNET system and transferred to all civil and military control centres. Ideally a radar tower is built on a high spot in the terrain, because this reduces the angle of elevation and thus increases the range of the radar device. In the absence of a suitable high spot, radar towers are used. Radar towers are also need to provide weather protection and services (air conditioning and power) for the radar equipment, communications, operators and maintainers In Germany the operational command posts of the German Air Force use the Bundeswehr radar towers for the stationary radar sites of the operational command areas. Military radar stations have supported US and allied air defense operations at numerous worldwide locations since World War II. The largest network of military radar stations evolved during the Cold War era to support the air defense of North America as part of the joint US and Canadian command known as the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). This military radar network became automated in 1960 with the operation of SAGE. SAGE provided the vital command, control, communications, and computers (C4S). Long Range Radar (LRR) stations were electronically connected to SAGE Direction Centers (DCs). This resulted in an integrated air defense system made up of radar, radio, interceptor aircraft, antiaircraft guns and missiles, and command and control (C2) facilities. Most of the radar and radio facilities were not on a military air base, but smaller Air Force Stations (AFS) usually located in rural and often isolated locations often miles away from even small towns. They were manned by up to several hundred Air Force personnel. An online radar museum provides descriptions of military radar stations at radomes.org/museum. Photographs of radar towers and radomes are provided. This includes the AN/FPS-24 search radar tower in a huge 64 foot square, 85 foot tall, five story building. On top of this radar tower was a radar antenna 50 feet tall, 120 feet wide, weighing 85.5 tons and rotating at 5 rpm. An available rigid radome 140 feet in diameter and 96 feet high protected this antenna from adverse weather conditions.

It is the only Pogonomyrmex species found on the east coast of the United States and the only one in North America known to be polymorphic. The species is ubiquitous in the Florida scrub habitats. Description P. badius is a relatively large species of harvester ant present throughout Florida scrub, making it one of the most notable and unique features of the ecoregion. The workers are highly polymorphic, ranging from 6.35mm for the smallest workers to 9.52mm for the largest majors which can rival the queen (10-12mm) in size.http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/ants/harvester_ant.htm Both queens, majors and intermediates have disproportionately large heads, while minors have a more narrower complexion when viewed at the front. Under normal circumstances this species lacks epinotal spines which sit parallel on the propodeum though these spines may occasionally be present. All individuals are typically a dark rust red with some populations exhibiting a bicolored character, having an orangish red rust tint to the gaster. Biology =Behavior= Colonies are near exclusively found nesting within well-drained sandy soils in xeric shrublands, grasslands, woodlands, and intact coastal dunes; being particularly partial to open areas with full sun.https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Pogonomyrmex_badius The nests of mature colonies are very deep, usually 2.5 to 3.0 meters deep with seeds being stored about 40-100 cm in large flat granaries below ground. On the surface the relatively flat mound is free of peripheral vegetation and is decorated with detritus and charred plant matter, the purpose of which is poorly understood. Alongside the nest also exists short foraging trails which extend into the surrounding area, usually in the opposite direction of any neighboring colonies. Colonies when mature can persist for as long as 30 years. Labor partitioning in the colony is organized spatially in respect to the vertical axis of the nest as a result of age polyethism. The youngest workers, which care for the brood and queen, reside in the deepest portions of the nest and as they age move closer to the surface and take up the typically more perilous activities of maintaining and defending the nest as well as foraging for food. The result is a division of the worker population along age demographics that's strongly stratified with depth. Among harvester ants P. badius is unusual for its seasonal nest relocations, with colonies on average relocating once per year at a distance of 4-10 meters along an established foraging trail. New nests are rapidly excavated within a few days and vary little in architectural design. Seeds commonly harvested includes those of Paspalum setaceum, Dicanthelium commutatum, Croton michauxii and more. Seeds preferred are limited by size, as any seeds wider than 1 - 1.4 mm cannot be cracked open by the workers. Arthropod prey is also regularly taken, with a strong affinity for protein food items over the traditionally consumed seeds. P. badius is preyed upon by relatively few animals - few well-known predators being the parasitoid eucharitid wasp Kapala floridana and the introduced Texas horned lizard, which thrives in Florida due to their stable populations. These ants may also be infected by the deadly Myrmicinosporidium durum, a parasitic fungus which causes the integument to turn a near black color. = Reproduction = right Colonies become reproductively mature at a population size greater than 700 workers and begin producing winged individuals around spring. Nuptial flights were observed from May to June most frequently in days of calm, sunny and humid mornings between the hours of 9 AM - 2 PM following a day of heavy rain. Female and male alates do not mate in the air and instead can be found mating at leks or at the surface of their natal nest with hundreds of excited workers accompanying them. During the excitement workers become increasingly more aggressive towards alates that attempt to re-enter the nest, with alates either being forcibly evicted or denied entrance to the nest by workers. The newly mated queens will either fly off or walk some distance away from their parent nest to establish a new colony. Founding queens may temporarily work together in a phenomenon known as pleometrosis, but true polygyny has never been observed in mature colonies in the wild. Queens are fully claustral and do not venture out to feed when founding, instead solely relying on their fat reserves and wing muscles for sustenance. = Venom toxicity = Like most species belonging to the genus Pogonomyrmex, badius is equipped with a stinger capable of delivering a highly potent and painful neurotoxic venom adapted for defense against predatory vertebrates. The venom of this species is considerably toxic, with a mice LD50 of 0¬∑42 Œºg/g - comparable to the most toxic snake venoms. Though the yield per sting is significantly low, multiple stings may prove dangerous to otherwise healthy individuals. Along with a few other Pogonomyrmex species, badius workers exhibit stinger autotomy in which the barbed stinger and venom sac is left embedded in the skin to continuously pump venom. The cost of this autotomy is the demise of the ant due to the internal damage from the stinger being pulled out, much like in Honey bees.

Silvesterkl√§use in the Old Sylvester, 13 January 2010. Silvesterklaus is a masked person taking part in Saint Sylvester's Day festivities in Appenzell, Switzerland, and thus contributing to maintain the Chlausen tradition. A Silvesterklaus or New Year‚Äôs Mummer (Chlaus in Swiss German) is dressed up as a Saint Sylvester or New Year‚Äôs Eve character. In the Reformed half-canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, the turn of the year is still celebrated in this way. History Saint Sylvester, or New Year‚Äôs Eve, is commemorated twice, once according to the Gregorian calendar on 31 December and again according to the Julian calendar on 13 January. The Silvesterkl√§use put on their strange costumes and, ringing huge bells and singing a very slow yodel, deambulate in small groups from house to house, to wish the people a happy new year. If 31 December or 13 January falls on a Sunday, the ceremony is celebrated on the preceding Saturday.. It is assumed that the Chlausen festival does not have pagan origins, but goes back to a late medieval Advent tradition involving students of a monastic school. In the 15th Century, with the celebrations becoming increasingly wild and carnival- like, the Catholic Church must have found that such behaviour hardly befitted the Advent season, which in turn may explain why the Chlausen custom was transferred from the Advent season to New Year's Eve. The tradition is first mentioned in 1663, when church authorities objected to such a noisy behaviour. In the Catholic half-canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI), according to some 18th-century records, taking part in the \\"Chlausen\\" tradition was punished with a heavy fine of five thalers. Nevertheless, the tradition survived in the Catholic half-canton on a small scale up to 1900, more or less tacitly tolerated by the local district authorities. This happened especially in the border areas near to reformed Appenzell Ausserrhoden, for example in Haslen, which is surrounded on three sides by the Ausserrhoden communities Hundwil, Stein, Teufen, and Buehler, or in Gonten, close to Urn√§sch and Hundwil. There were also mixed groups, uniting members from Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden (this still happens occasionally), and there were sometimes isolated characters too. Nowadays, the tradition is kept alive in the Protestant half-canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden (AR). Form Three different types of Silvesterchl√§use can be distinguished. The Sch√∂ne (Beautiful), the Sch√∂-W√ºeschte (Pretty-Ugly) and the W√ºeschte (Ugly). * The Beautiful have very ornate embroidered headgear with scenes of peasant life, domestic customs and crafts, special buildings, sports, or family life, which take hundreds of hours of intensive work. Their dress resembles a local traditional costume. * The Pretty-Ugly wear a costume made of fir twigs, ivy, moss, and other natural materials, and a headgear similar in shape to those of the Beautiful, but also decorated with natural materials. * The Ugly wear a costume made from the same materials as the Pretty-Ugly, but coarser and more massive in appearance. On their head they wear a hat or a helmet, artfully crafted but having a wild appearance. All characters hide their faces behind a mask, which is either sweet and doll-like (Beautiful), finely covered with natural materials (Pretty-Ugly), or scary looking (Ugly). The young people, in children‚Äôs groups, are usually without a mask. A fourth variant exists as Spasschl√§use (Jokers), now getting rare. They represent a somewhat freer form of the tradition, and are usually dressed in a lighter costume, illustrating professional people (for instance farmers, forestry workers or cooks). They walk in smaller groups of 4 men and do not carry proper head gear, but only masks, kerchiefs or black pointed caps. These are former members, or yodelers, who want to keep up the tradition without the huge investment of time and energy needed for the production of the detailed costumes belonging to the main figures. The characters represent either men or women, but in fact only men take part in the groups, due to the heavy costumes, the weight of the very large bells or the many jingle bells. Every group plans its tour carefully in advance. A group consists of six people: two wear women's clothes and carry numerous jingle bells. The leading Klaus has a white flower in his mouth, his follower, a blue one. All the male figures carry one or two jingle bells on their chests and backs. Geographic distribution This traditional Silvesterklausen is still alive throughout Appenzell Ausserrhoden, in the Appenzeller Hinterland, that is, in the communities of Urn√§sch, Schwellbrunn, Sch√∂nengrund, Herisau, Waldstatt, Hundwil and Stein, and in the central municipality of Teufen. Isolated groups can also be seen in the localities of Buhler and Speicher.

Background and Family  Waldoks was born on July 17, 1949 in Toledo Ohio to Holocaust survivors who arrived from displaced person‚Äôs camps surrounding Munich two weeks earlier. His father Yidel, a native of the Vohlynia, Western Ukraine city of Lutzk and its environs, was a sole survivor of a large nuclear and extended family. Yidel's wife and daughter perished in the wake of the Einzatzgruppen, the Nazi mobile killing units that entered Poland in 1941. His mother, Bronia Lipnicka, was from Sosnowitz in Upper Silesia that was annexed into the Reich immediately after the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. She, her mother and one sister survived a large nuclear and extended family in a Nazi labor camp in Czechoslovakia. Waldoks was raised in Yiddish speaking home and was enrolled in Yiddish speaking yeshivot (parochial schools) for his primary and part of his early high school education - Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway and BTA, Brooklyn Talmudical Academy, a high school associated with Yeshiva University. Waldoks is married to Anne Pomerantz Waldoks, a clinical psychologist, and is the father of 3 daughters.  Education  Waldoks attended the Washington Square campus of NYU from 1966-68 and then completed undergraduate studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he studied The History of Jewish Thought. In 1971, he entered into a doctoral program at Brandeis University in the department of Near East and Jewish studies. He completed his doctorate in 1984, with a dissertation on Hillel Zeitlin, a Warsaw-based Yiddish journalist, Hebrew writer and mystic who was murdered by the Nazis in 1942.  Career  Upon his arrival in Boston in 1971, Waldoks became engaged in community activism and served on numerous boards of Jewish organizations. He was on the executive committee of the Jewish Community Relations Council for 17 years. From 1974-77, while a graduate student, Waldoks helped established a full time position as Hillel Director at Tufts University. From 1979-1986, he taught Jewish studies at Clark University in Worcester MA and served in many adjunct positions at Colleges and Universities in the Boston area. In 1981 he, along with-co-editor William Novak, published THE BIG BOOK OF JEWISH HUMOR (HarperCollins). A 25th anniversary edition with additional material was published in 2006. In 1994, Waldoks co-edited the Best of American Humor (Simon & Schuster). From 1982-1990, Waldoks produced close to two hundred cable television programs for the then early pre-internet years of community cable stations. This series named Aleph was the first Jewish television show in the Boston area. From 1986-1998, Waldoks traveled and performed as a stand-up comedian, storyteller, philosopher and sage for over 100 communities in the United States and Canada. He also performed at National conferences and many fundraising events. Since 1974, Waldoks has been heavily involved in interfaith relations. First with the Christian, particularly the Catholic, community; later the Tibetan-Buddhist community, and in recent years with the Muslim community. In 1985, Waldoks visited the former Soviet Union to connect with Jewish ‚Äúrefusniks\\" who were held back from leaving the country for a variety of reasons, security and otherwise. In 1988, he participated in the Polish Bishops Conference in Tinietz, a monastery located in a Krakow suburb. This trip, sponsored by the ADL, was a groundbreaking opportunity to assess the situation of Jewish-Catholic relations in Poland that had hardly been influenced by the Vatican II encyclicals Nostra Aetate of 1965, when John Paul the 23rd provided the most inclusive statement of the Church and the Jews. In 1989 and 1990 Waldoks was instrumental in helping to convene the first Jewish-Tibetan Jewish Dialogue with the Dali Lama, first in the New York area and in the following year at the seat of the Tibetan government in Exile in Dharamsala, India. In 1999, Waldoks participated as one of the Jewish leaders in a Catholic-Jewish pilgrimage to Israel and Rome sponsored by the New England Region of the Anti-Defamation League. In 1996, Waldoks was ordained as a non-denominational Rabbi by his mentors Rabbis Zalman- Schachter-Shalomi, of blessed memory, Arthur Green and Everett Gendler. In 1998, he took on the transformation of a moribund synagogue, Temple Beth Zion, in Brookline, Massachusetts and was successful over the next 21 years in creating a vibrant community rebranded as TBZ. At present, Waldoks has transitioned from TBZ‚Äôs Senior Rabbi to its Founding Rabbi and is offering his services on a part-time basis.

The company is based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India and was developed by ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. , Ola was valued at about $6.5 billion A variety of venture capitalists including Softbank have large stakes in the company. Ola Cabs was founded on 3 December 2010 as an online cab aggregator in Mumbai, and is now based in Bangalore. As of 2019, the company has expanded to a network of more than 15 lakh (1.5 million) drivers across 250 cities. In November 2014, Ola diversified to incorporate auto rickshaws on a trial basis in Bangalore. After the trial phase, Ola Auto expanded to other cities like Delhi, Pune, Chennai and Hyderabad starting in December 2014. In January 2018, Ola extended into its first overseas market, Australia, and in New Zealand in September 2018. In March 2019, Ola began its UK operations introducing auto rickshaws in UK. More than 10,000 drivers have applied both in online and offline mode ahead of its launch in London. In February 2020, Ola launched its taxi-hailing services with over 25,000 drivers registered. History In March 2015, Ola Cabs acquired Bangalore-based taxi service TaxiForSure for approximately ‚Çπ1,394 crore (US$200 million). June 2015 onwards, Ola users gained access to TFS cabs via the Ola mobile application. Later in the year in November, Ola further acquired Geotagg, a trip-planning applications company, for an undisclosed sum. In a move to expand beyond cab aggregation, Ola acquired struggling foodtech company Foodpanda with an eye on leveraging the growing food delivery segment business in December 2017. In April 2018, Ola made its second acquisition with Ridlr (formerly Traffline), a public transport ticketing app. Later in August 2018, Ola financed Series A funding of the scooter rent startup Vogo, and again in December, invested another $100 million. The Karnataka state transport department suspended Ola's operating license for six months for violation of licence conditions and violation of Karnataka On- Demand Transportation Technology Aggregator Rules, 2016. This was on account of Ola running bike taxi services though it only had license for four wheeler taxi operations. The company termed the order unfortunate and was looking at working with driving partners to continue functioning. They also claimed to be in touch with authorities to sort things out. Services Ola offers different levels of service, ranging from economic to luxury travel. The cabs are reserved through a mobile app and also through their website and the service accepts both cash and cashless payments with Ola money. It claims to clock an average of more than 1,50,000 bookings per day and commands 60% of the market share in India as of 2014. Ola Electric Mobility Ola spun off its electric vehicles business into a separate unit called Ola Electric Mobility with US$56 million of funding capital in February 2019. The funding was provided by Tiger Global and Matrix India. Apart from electric vehicles, Ola Electric also works on charging solutions, EV batteries and developing viable infrastructure to allow commercial EVs to operate at scale. The company announced on 6 May 2019 that Ratan Tata had invested an undisclosed amount in Ola Electric as part of its Series A round of funding. Ola Electric raised $250 million from SoftBank during Series B round funding in July 2019, earning a valuation of over $1 billion. Anand Shah, co-founder, Ola Electric and senior VP, Ola Cabs said that Ola Electric will need more capital to achieve its target of putting 10 lakh (1 million) EVs on the roads by 2021. Ola Electric acquired Amsterdam-based EV startup Etergo on 27 May 2020 to launch own line of electric scooters in 2020. Criticism =Technology= Ola Cabs' technology came under criticism regarding the security of its mobile app. The API calls could be replayed to top up its wallet. In August 2016, a privacy breach occurred when customers' details such as names, phone numbers and addresses, in Bangalore, were received as SMS messages by an individual in Chennai. Although these unanticipated messages were reported to Ola, the company ignored them, even under the threat of being reported to the TRAI. The issue was reportedly fixed three weeks later after receiving considerable media coverage and social media attention. =Overcharging and lack of transparency in charging= The refund policy of Ola Cabs has been criticised because of charging errors caused by technical glitches in their system. Surge pricing has been an issue with customers, as Ola is said to initially eliminate competition by lowering prices, and then hiking up prices through what it calls surge pricing. The fact that the same ride can cost different amounts depending on the time, day and the profiles, history and rating of the driver as well as passenger has also incurred much customer wrath. =Driver concerns= Ola from January 2017 has been highly criticised for continuously dropping the driver incentives which in turn is affecting driver-partner's monthly income. Most nowadays fail to cope with their monthly EMIs and other dues. Daily income of cab drivers is now equal to auto drivers running in the city after deducting all dues. Charges comprise: * Base fare (fixed amount) * Distance fare (charged per kilometre) * Ride time fare (charged per time taken to travel) * Peak pricing (direct ratio depending on demand for cabs) *GST (5%) * Toll charges (toll collection if crossing a toll junction) Ola and Uber have also been criticised due to their practice of baiting drivers and passengers, initially with discounts and bonuses, and then hiking up fares without passing the proceeds to drivers. Their practice of taking large signing up amounts from drivers and not considering them employees has also been criticised. Both companies contractually treat drivers as \\"contractors\\" thus excusing themselves from any legal obligations. In an interview, Pranay Jivrajka, a co-founder of OLA, claimed that the company will be creating 50 lakh new \\"opportunities\\" in the next five years. He was, however, careful not use the word jobs for these opportunities. He added that it was not just about jobs but creating an ecosystem. Assaults on and Murders of Ola cab drivers  There have been 11 cases of murders, and over 90 cases of kidnapping and robbery of drivers working for app-based cab aggregators including Ola, by criminals posing as passengers using fake profiles.https://dbpost.com/not- only-passengers-even-cabbies-are-at-risk-of-getting-killed/ The most recent case happened in the city of Pune in June 2019 when a passenger killed the driver to steal his car. Two other murders of Ola drivers by robbers took place in New Delhi and Agra respectively. =Driver credibility= Panic button for passengers in an Ola car in Kolkata Delhi Transport authority in early 2015 questioned the credibility and required verification of drivers working for Ola, along with other competitors such as Uber. The inquiry revealed that approximately 80% of drivers amongst all services did not possess permits to ply commercial transport services in Delhi. Drivers also protested outside the Kukatapally, Hyderabad office of Ola, demanding more transparency over payments.

He was a charter member of the Illinois State Dental Society, and founded the Dental Protective Association, an organization that litigated against process patents in dentistry, serving as its president until 1913. He also served a term as president of the American Dental Association, then known as the National Dental Association. Early life and education Crouse was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, on September 15, 1842, the son of Daniel and Mary Crouse. He later moved with his parents to Mount Carroll, Illinois. He and his siblings first attended the common schools, and then the Mount Carroll Seminary (later Shimer College), where Crouse attended from 1859 to 1862. Crouse practiced dentistry in Mount Carroll starting in 1864, then traveled to the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery, where he obtained his DDS in 1867. Professional career Crouse first returned to Mount Carroll to practice, but moved to Chicago in 1868. Shortly thereafter he became one of the charter members of the state dental association. Dental Protective Association In 1888, Crouse founded the Dental Protective Association (DPA) to protect against legal threats to the profession. From 1895 to 1908, the Association published the Dental Digest as its official organ. The DPA was initially organized to defend against patent claims brought against dentists by the International Tooth Crown Company, which held patents on important improvements in crown and bridge work. The DPA defeated every patent suit it fought through at least 1900. Criticism of the DPA arose in 1898 due to Crouse's having established a for-profit company with a very similar name, the Dental Protective Supply Company. Deeper problems arose in 1910 over Dr. William Taggart's invention of a method of preparing gold inlay fillings. Although many dentists regarded the patents as an attack on the profession, others regarded Taggart's invention as worthy of patent protection. Crouse and the DPA joined the latter camp. The DPA set up a licensing scheme under which its members could send in $75 for a license on Taggart's machine and process, or $15 for the process alone. The DPA's further inclusion of a provision in its bylaws forbidding members to contest the Taggart patent incensed many in the dental community. One group formed the National Dental Protective Association in 1909. Taggart's process patent was invalidated by the DC Court of Appeals in Boynton v. Taggart in 1912, dealing a further blow to the DPA's prestige. Death and legacy Crouse died of heart failure on January 16, 1914. He was buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago. The DPA remained in operation through at least 1922.

Early life and education  He was born in Stour Provost, Dorset, England, the son of the local Anglican vicar. He attended Rugby School before enlisting in the 57th Regiment in 1869, rising to the rank of captain.  Military and colonial service  left In 1880, Denton joined the Colonial Service as chief of police on Saint Vincent. He served as its acting Colonial Secretary from 1886 to 1888 and was appointed as Colonial Secretary of the Colony of Lagos in 1889. He was knighted in January 1889. Denton was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Lagos in early March 1900, but in November of that year was re- assigned as Administrator of the Gambia. Upon his appointment, he was described by the St James's Gazette as a \\"many-sided man\\" due to his interests in geography and zoology. In March 1901, his position was upgraded from Administrator to Governor, the first Governor of the Gambia since 1866. As Governor, Denton completed the work began by his predecessor, Robert Baxter Llewelyn, in establishing the framework of British rule in the Protectorate. He did this by issuing a series of ordinances that clarified and set out the system. Denton also led the punitive expedition against Fode Kaba in 1901, a leading resistance leader in the Senegambia region, which led to Kaba's death. Denton also successfully argued against the requirements of the Entente Cordiale, which would have assigned a mid-river port on the Gambia to the French. Denton said that the port would destroy British trade on the river and was a key factor in the British delaying their planned cession until after World War I, and, in the end, delay the plans indefinitely. In 1902, on leave from the Gambia in England, Denton brought the Zoological Society of London five mammals and five birds, which, according to the London Evening Standard, had been \\"unrepresented for a considerable time in the menagerie.\\" Mary Gaunt, upon meeting Denton, described him as \\"surely the nicest governor ever lucky colony had\\". Denton also made a contribution to domestic politics in the Gambia, appointing S. J. Forster, Jr, to the Legislative Council in 1906. Denton retired from the Gambia in December 1911. According to his obituary published in The Times he ensured that \\"considerable progress was made both in the condition of the [Gambian] people and in trade.\\"  Retirement  Denton retired to England after his service in the Gambia concluded in 1911. He died in 1928 at Chigwell Row in Essex.

Microcoils produced by electroplating copper on Spirulina bacteria. A microcoil is a tiny electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a spiral or helix which could be a solenoid or a planar structure. One field where these are found is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where it identifies radio frequency (RF) coils that are smaller than 1 mm. The microcoils have also found usefulness in telemetry systems, where planar microcoils are used to supply energy to miniaturized implants. The detection limits of Micro-MRI or MRM can be pushed further by taking advantage of microsystem fabrication techniques. In general, the RF receiver coil should closely conform to the sample to ensure good detection sensitivity. A properly designed NMR probe will maximize both the observe factor, which is the ratio of the sample volume being observed by the RF coil to the total sample volume required for analysis, and the filling factor, the ratio of the sample volume being observed by the RF coil to the coil volume. The miniaturization of NMR probes thus involves two advantages: # Increased sensitivity which without it the analysis of such low concentration compounds would be impossible, and # Increase of filling factor by matching the probe to the sample volume. Still, the extraction of the NMR spectra of samples having smaller and smaller volumes is a real challenge. Either these reductions of volume are dictated by the difficulties of production of sufficiently large samples or by the necessities of miniaturization of the analysing system, in both cases a careful design of the radiofrequency coils, ensuring an optimum reception of the NMR signal, are required.Behrooz, Fateh (2006) Modeling, Simulation and Optimization of a Microcoil for MRI-Cell Imaging, Master Thesis, University of Freiburg, Germany Microcoil types Three microcoil types which are commonly used in NMR: =Solenoid microcoils= Is the classical geometry to create a magnetic field with an electric current. Even for a limited number of windings this geometry provides a reasonable homogeneous B1 field and a good filling factor is possible by winding the coil directly onto a holder containing the sample. Miniaturization to a scale of several hundred micrometers (¬µm) is not very difficult although the wire diameter (typically 20 to 50 ¬µm) becomes very small and a freestanding coil is a very delicate object. A reduction to below 100 ¬µm diameter is possible but the machining and handling of such coils will be rather tedious. For this reason other microsystem fabrication technology such as bulk micromachining, LIGA and micro-injection molding should be applied. For solenoid coils adding more turns to the coil will enhance the B1/i ratio and thus both the inductance and the signal response. At the same time the coil resistance will increase linearly, so the improvement in sensitivity will be proportional to the square root of the number of turns (n). At the same time we will have a larger ohmic heating at the center of the coil and an enhanced danger for arcing, so the optimum is generally found for only a limited number of turns. Besides RF performance, static field distortions due to susceptibility effects are an important factor in the design of microcoil probeheads. =Planar microcoils= Is the most common geometry used, based on a spiral design with the center winding contacted to the outside using a connection to another layer which is electrically isolated with a thin oxide layer. In this configuration the axis of the RF coil will be oriented perpendicular to the external static field B0. =Saddle microcoils= The saddle coil shows the most complex geometry of these three coil types. The B1 field is generated primarily by the four vertical wire segments. Because of this coil geometry, the B1 field of a saddle coil is more homogeneous in z direction than that of a planar coil. The saddle coil can be formed from wire, but it is also often etched from thin copper foil, which is then adhered to glass or PTFE tubing. The latter procedure leads to a high geometric precision, resulting in better B1 homogeneity. The saddle coil is easily accessible and provides a good ‚Äòfilling factor‚Äô of the usable area in the magnet bore. For these reasons it is widely used in NMR microscopy. However, these advantages are achieved at the price of decreased sensitivity. Compared to a saddle coil, the sensitivity performance of a solenoidal coil of the same dimensions is approximately three times better.

Found in North America, the species is common in the eastern United States and Canada, though they can be found all over the continent. They are usually light brown in color, with a slightly darker head. Biology Lasius neoniger are relatively small ants who prefer to nest in open habitats, including lawns and sidewalks. Colonies of these ants are monogamous and are unwilling to accept other queens or merge with other colonies of the same species. They are one of the many species of ants who tend aphids, who provide the ants with a regular source of sugar and occasionally protein. Colonies have a nuptial flight around the beginning of September, near labour day. The new queens will dig a claustral chamber and hibernate for the winter before starting their new colony the following spring. Ecological Impact Due to their preference for open habitats, Lasius neoniger are one of the first species of ants to move into disturbed areas. The building of their nests triples soil respiration and increases biodiversity in the area by encouraging other insects to move in. This in turn has a trickle down effect as the new insects attract other animals and plants.

It was built by the Order of Saint John in the 18th century as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands. The battery is considered as the best preserved of the Order's batteries in Malta, since it retains all of its original features. Many other batteries have been destroyed or otherwise modified, and very few have survived in their original state. History The first plans to construct a battery at Mistra Bay were made in 1714, where the knight Mongontier donated 133 scudi for its construction. The battery does not appear in the 1715-1716 list of coastal fortifications, but possibly a gun platform was built some years later. However, the battery as it is today was built over forty years later in 1761 due to the insistence by the military engineer Bourlamaque, during the reign of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. Coats of arms of the Order, Pinto and the Bailli de Montagnac above the main entrance The battery has a roughly semi-circular gun platform, with its northern face having a parapet with three embrasures. There was no parapet around the rest of the platform. The battery is partially surrounded by a shallow rock hewn ditch that was left unfinished. The battery has two blockhouses, which are linked together by a redan with musketry loopholes. The redan also contains the main entrance, which is surmounted by the coats of arms of the Order, of Grand Master Pinto and of the Bailli de Montagnac. When completed in 1761, the battery had an armament of three 24-pounder and six 8-pounder iron cannons. By 1770, the armament was reduced to just a single 8-pounder cannon, and all armaments were removed by 1785. The battery was later rearmed once again with 18-pounder cannons. These were removed by Maltese insurgents during the French blockade of 1798-1800, and were taken to Gƒßargƒßar Battery. Mistra Battery was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and it was the only coastal battery to be specifically mentioned in this list. Present day Mistra Battery's gun platform, with the rebuilt embrasures in the background At some point, the battery's parapet with embrasures was demolished. The battery was used as a store by P2M Fisheries, and a number of alterations were made, in which some parts of the battery were destroyed. The fisheries company obtained new premises in 2012 and restored the battery before returning it to the government. Despite this, the battery and the surrounding area was vandalized repeatedly. Since then, more restoration works were undertaken by Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna. The destroyed embrasures and musketry loopholes were rebuilt, and layer of concrete over the gun platform was removed. The battery's ditch was also restored. Currently, work is being done to build replicas of the battery's cannons. The battery is currently closed to the public due to ongoing restoration works, however Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna plans to open it as a cultural attraction in 2015. As of April 2016, the battery is at final stages of restoration, but not yet open to the public (as per sign on main entrance).

Early life Watteau was born Monique Dubois in Li√®ge on 23 December 1929. Her father was Hubert Dubois, a playwright and poet with ties to Surrealism. Watteau studied painting and drawing at the Acad√©mie royale des beaux-arts de Li√®ge, and then went on to the Royal Conservatory of Li√®ge to study theatre. At twenty, she left Belgium for Paris, where she met the Belgian scientist Bernard Heuvelmans, famous for his work in cryptozoology. In 1951, she appeared under the name Monique Watteau in Jean Anouilh's film . She also worked as a photography model. Career Watteau's first novel, La col√®re v√©g√©tale, was published in 1954. Critics praised it as a striking literary debut; Albert-Marie Schmidt wrote that Watteau had created \\"a new kind of fantasy\\" (un nouveau fantastique). Watteau was reportedly considered for the Prix Goncourt and the Prix Femina, but she was removed from the running of the latter prize in 1954 when the jury discovered that she had posed for nude photographs. Her following novels, La nuit aux yeux de b√™te (1956), L'ange √† fourrure (1958), and Je suis le t√©n√©breux (1962), cemented her reputation as one of the foremost Francophone fantasy writers of the twentieth century. Her work is marked by its sensuality of expression and its ecological, Taoist, and Surrealist themes. The writer described Watteau's novels as prime examples of feminism in twentieth-century fantasy. Her first three novels were written under the name Monique Watteau; her fourth gave her name as Monique-Alika Watteau. After its publication, she abandoned the name Monique altogether, going by Alika Watteau and later Alika Lindbergh. After publishing four novels, she turned to painting as a career. Her output as a painter includes a notable corpus of cryptozoological art, including her work as the primary illustrator of Bernard Heuvelmans's books. When the cartoonist Herg√©, researching Tintin in Tibet, asked Heuvelmans for details on the yeti, Watteau supplied a \\"graphic reconstitution\\" of the creature for Herg√©'s reference. In the 1970s, Watteau published two new books, Nous sommes deux dans l'Arche et Quand les singes hurleurs se tairont. She published an autobiographical work, Le testament d'une f√©e, in 2002. Watteau also worked as an animal rights activist. In the early 1990s, she was the president of the Cercle national pour la d√©fense de la vie, de la nature, et de l'animal (CNDVNA), a conservation advocacy group within the French National Front. Personal life Heuvelmans was Watteau's first husband; they divorced in 1961, but remained friends and collaborators. According to her autobiography, Watteau was romantically involved with actor Yul Brynner from 1961 to 1967. It was after this affair that she changed her first name to Alika, which she and Brynner had used as her nom d'amour. She married zoologist Scott Lindbergh, son of aviator Charles Lindbergh, in 1968. In 1972, Lindbergh and Watteau established a grant-funded primate research center on an 82-acre estate in the Dordogne valley in France, where they raised and studied dozens of South American monkeys. Watteau and Lindbergh separated in 1983. During Watteau's marriage to Lindbergh, the couple arranged for Heuvelmans, then in poverty, to live in a small house on the grounds of the Dordogne estate. Watteau attended to Heuvelmans during his final years, and was with him at his death in 2001. In accordance with his last wishes, Watteau was in charge of his private funeral in Le V√©sinet.

It is native to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and is listed as \\"endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This species was formerly known as Montastraea faveolata. Description Close-up of corallites Colonies of this coral are solid and very large, forming a mound with a skirt. The surface is smooth and undulating, with small lumps, bulges or lobes. The corallites, the stony cups in which the polyps sit, are about in diameter and cover the entire surface of the coral. The colour is usually pale brown but may be deep brown with fluorescent green highlights. This coral is part of a species complex including the closely related Orbicella annularis and Orbicella franksi, but the former has more distinct nodules or small columns and the latter has a more irregular, lumpy surface. Distribution and habitat Orbicella faveolata occurs in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, its range including Florida, the Bahamas, Venezuela and possibly Bermuda. It is found on both the back reef and fore reef slopes of fringing reefs at depths of up to . It is often the most abundant coral species on fore reef slopes between . Biology Like other corals, Orbicella faveolata has a symbiotic relationship with a dinoflagellate in the genus Symbiodinium. These symbionts are commonly known as zooxanthellae and large numbers are present in the coral's living tissue. Several different species of Symbiodinium associate with the coral, depending on the degree of light intensity reaching the part of the surface where they reside. When artificial shading was applied by researchers to corals for some weeks, the Symbiodinium died out in the shaded portion. When the light was restored, zooxanthellae became reinstated, but in many instances, the original species was replaced by a different species of Symbiodinium. The surface of the coral can be considered a microbiome, an ecological community of micro-organisms. The zooxanthellae, bacteria and archaea present vary with the time of year and in the spring (but not the autumn) their composition is also affected by the health of the coral and whether it is suffering from yellow-band disease. Status Orbicella faveolata is a slow-growing species and the rate at which new colonies are formed is less than the rate at which mature colonies die. It is susceptible to bleaching and to several coral diseases including yellow-band disease, black band disease and plague. Numbers of individuals are believed to have declined by over 50% in the last thirty years and the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists its conservation status as being \\"endangered\\".

Taking into account the concerning rates of youth unemployment, she decided to launch her personal traineeship programme \\"ProƒçBynNe?\\" - \\"Why not?\\". Putting effectively into use the business and academic network that she knows well from her previous profession, she offers around 12 traineeships per year to motivated young people to enable them to strive for their goals as well as to give them assurances that if they want to achieve something in life, they can do it. The selection of youngsters (aged 18‚Äì25) is not based on the highest qualifications but on the biggest motivation to do the job. The traineeships can vary from shadowing for two weeks the Minister of Finance to learning the best recipes of the top chef of the country or mentoring by master craftsmen. A separate website was launched introducing the project - www.procbyne.cz. A further idea is to bring this traineeship scheme from the Czech Republic to other EU countries ‚Äì using a similar young person-MEP-business/academia formula.

History The bridge was installed around 1906 where Fountainbridge crossed the canal replacing a previous bridge built in 1869. When the canal was shortened in 1922 to make Lochrin Basin the terminus it was moved to its present site to replace a wooden drawbridge. It fell out of use by the 1960s, but as part of the Millennium Link project to restore the Union Canal, it required to be restored at least to allow boats to pass. A report published in the year 2000 had suggested fixing it permanently open, but the decision was taken to restore it to full working order. The restoration involved removing the deck and the top member of the bridge to access the inner workings. It opened for the first time on 16 May 2002, followed by an official opening ceremony on 24 May. Design The permanent footbridge The bridge is constructed from a wooden deck that can be raised between two gantries to give a clearance of below. The bridge crosses between Gilmore Park and Leamington Road, but is not open to cars. A permanent lattice girder footbridge allows pedestrians to cross when the deck is raised. It is formed from riveted steel, with more substantial columns on the southern side where the motors and counterbalances are housed. The bridge can be opened by canal users after appropriate training from Scottish Canals. It is only the width of single canal boat.

Cheyenne Creek is a stream in Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado at in elevation. The stream is fed by the North Cheyenne Creek and South Cheyenne Creek and flows into Fountain Creek near Nevada Avenue, between Interstate 25 and the Pikes Peak Greenway trail. North Cheyenne Creek and South Cheyenne Creek flow through Teller and El Paso Counties. The source of South Cheyenne Creek is Mount Big Chief, near St. Peter's Dome, and it flows to Seven Falls. History Before Europeans settled in the area, Cheyenne set up tepees at the confluence of the Fountain and Cheyenne Creeks when they traveled through the area. About 1859, Irving Howbert and his family settled near the creeks. The following year, John Wolfe settled along Cheyenne Creek. In the 1880s, Willie Wilcox and James Purtales dammed part of Cheyenne Creek in Broadmoor that ran through their Broadmoor Dairy property to create a man-made lake to make a more enticing environment for a hotel and casino that they were building. The city of Colorado Springs, in an effort to supplement the water needed to be supplied for the town, \\"continued to steal water\\". Resolution of a legal suit deemed Wilcox and Purtales the water rights holders. Ivywild was established in 1888 and platted by William B. Jenkins, along Cheyenne Creek. It is west of the current Cascade Avenue and south of downtown. Winfield Scott Stratton, president of the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway, bought the land in 1900 and donated 20 acres for the park he named Cheyenne Park (later Stratton Park). The park‚Äîthat had bridges, rock walls for Cheyenne Creek, and footpaths along what had been land of hills, wildflowers, and wildlife‚Äîwas on the Cheyenne Canyon trolley line.

This volcanic center erupted after the Voyager 1 flyby in 1979, making it one of the few planetary volcanoes known to have activated during this generation's lifetime. Further analysis and study by the Galileo spacecraft helped with the overall study of Io's volcanism. Galileo located it on Io at . Zamama has a fissure-fed-type flow that is long with temperatures of , and the volcanic center site has explosive and effusive eruption characteristics. The flow appears to be emanating from the Promethean-type volcano. Remote sensing instruments built on the Galileo spacecraft‚Äîthe Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), Solid-State Imager (SSI), Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR)‚Äîcollect and analyze volcanism on Io's surface. Since there are no samples collected from Io, all of the interpretations are made by studying albedo effects, morphology and/or spectral variations in Galileo data. Furthermore, Geomorphologic analysis is strictly used to study such specific planetary structures. Overview of the Voyager and Galileo missions Most of the data acquired from the Jovian moon Io was derived from geomorphologic interpretations of orbital imaging. Voyager 1 and Galileo both used thermal remote sensing to accomplish this task. Thermal remote sensing is a branch of remote sensing which deals with processing and interpretations of data in the thermal infrared (TIR) region of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. Zamama is a hotspot/volcanic center among 61 active volcanic centers on Io. These were observed by the Voyager flybys, by Galileo, and by ground-based observations. Zamama was first observed by Galileo, which identified two types of volcanic activity: persistent and sporadic. The NIMS instrument detected activity at Zamama lasting longer than one year; therefore, it is considered the persistent type. It has only been NIMS-detected five times, but NIMS-observed nine times. This lower incidence of detection could be due to observational constraints or temporary waning of activity. Volcanism on Zamama =Volcanic topography= Lava flow field on Zamama. Image was captured using Solid-State Imaging during the Galileo mission. Io is one of the most challenging Jovian moons for which to establish topography. A couple techniques aided in the making of Io's topography, such as \\"3D\\" stereo photogrammetry (SP) and \\"2D\\" photoclinometry (PC). Ionian volcanoes have been poorly characterized because of their volcanic construct, which is different than well-studied planetary volcanoes such as those on Mars. Two common flow field morphologies have been identified on Io: * Large broad irregular flows (flow sheets). * Radially centered flow fields. Zamama region on Io showing three volcanoes (Zamama A, B, and C) marked by white arrows. Zamama (A) shield volcano and the dark main flow complex spreading eastward. The Zamama active volcanic center is characterized morphologically by a radially centered flow field. Multiple steep-sided shield volcanoes lie in this area: * Zamama A (18¬∞N, 175¬∞W), is about wide, high, and has an average slope of 40¬∞. Slope and height were estimated by PC. It extends about east and beyond the topographic margin of the observed steep-sided shield. Zamama A is the source of the Zamama flow field. The origin of volcanism is both siliceous and sulfuric, although Zamama originates from a Prometheus-type plume. * Zamama B is located southeast of Zamama A, and is about wide and high. Height was estimated by PC shadow measurements. * Zamama C (15¬∞N, 170¬∞W) is located southeast of the Zamama volcanic center, is about high, and has a slope that ranges between 3¬∞-5¬∞. Height was determined by PC. =Surface changes= Zamama appears to have been inactive during the 1979 Voyager 1 visit, or, it may have been buried by the Volund deposits. In contrast, Zamama appeared as a very active hot spot during the Galileo observations. Zamama has shown three notable surface changes in the SSI collected images. Images show them as bright rings, placed within the dark lava flows, with diameters of about . In addition, new black rings were deposited north and northeast of the central prominent eruption. This most prominent central eruption was the first to take place (18¬∞ N, 171¬∞ W). The total area changed was about . Second, a new eruption caused broadening in the central dark deposits of the western side and new bright rings were deposited along the margins of the lava flows. The total area effected was about . Third, Zamama's third plume was actively erupting while Galileo was on its 14th orbit around Jupiter. New deposits enlarged to and are centered east of the eruptive center. Total affected area was about . =Temperature= The graph of eruption rate shows plunges which indicate lessening in diffusive activity or cooling of old flow surface. As well, it shows a spike, which indicates the beginning of a new eruption. The power output flux graph compares Zamama with other Ionian volcanoes of the same eruptive style. Galileo NIMS instrument collected data on volcanic emissions to analyze the power output. A two-temperature model is used to determine the temperature and power output. Models have shown that Zamama has a temperature of . Pyroclastic flows with high silica content can have temperatures as high as . Since Zamama volcanoes have such high temperatures, this indicates siliceous magma. No actual samples of Zamama's magma have been retrieved and processed for composition. =Composition= Lava flows at Zamama suggest that it is a shield volcano with a central vent and a rift zone. The rift zone seems to feed the dark flow field, which appeared in the Galileo visit. The flow field appeared narrow/thin closer to the center, and wide/broad away from the center. This behavior might be due to a change in slope from the volcano rim to the nearby plains. The central vent emanates bright flows, due to sulfurous lava composition or silicate lava coated by sulfurous deposits. The composition of the lava emitted from the volcano is still mysterious. =Volcanic parameters= Zamama has lower volumetric emission rates, compared with other Ionian volcanoes of the same eruptive style, and is more powerful than its terrestrial counterparts such as the volcano Kƒ´lauea in Hawaii. NIMS data analysis was conducted to determine the variability of thermal emissions from volcanoes on Io‚Äîparticularly Zamama‚Äîfor 1,038 days (28 June 1996 to 2 May 1999) and the results showed: * Average volumetric rates decreased at the beginning of the period, which indicates a lessening in diffusive activity, or cooling of old flow surface. Later, there was an increase in volcanic activity, indicating the beginning of an eruption. * Total power output observed at Zamama was . * Average power output was . * Total volume erupted through this period was . * Average volumetric flux was . Comparison and evolution =Comparisons with Ionian and terrestrial volcanoes= * Zamama has lower volumetric emission rates compared to various styles of eruptions on Io. * Zamama is more powerful than its terrestrial counterparts such as Kƒ´lauea, Hawaii. * In general, Io's eruptions have larger volumetric fluxes and active areas than terrestrial volcanoes, compared with volcanoes of the same eruption style. =Evolution of Ionian shield volcanoes= Model demonstrating how caldera volcanoes collapse. Most Ionian volcanoes start as steep-sided shield volcanoes. After an eruptive construct-building phase, the central region collapses to form a caldera. Since steep-sided shield volcanoes have not been observed inside collapsed calderas, this indicates a failure to reform steep-sided volcanoes after the collapse, which can be associated with various variables such as change in temperature, eruptive rate, and/or lava composition. Failure to reform shield volcanoes is caused by failure to supply magma through the magma chamber. These interpretations might be a sign that current shield volcanoes will follow this pattern and transform to caldera- forming eruptive sites. Future Io exploration Williams (2013) suggests the need for a variety of methods for observing Io in the future: \\"Future Io exploration is recommended to include: 1) a Jupiter-orbiting Io Observer spacecraft of either Discovery-class or New Frontiers-class; 2) a space-based UV telescope with diffraction-limited capability; 3) space-based missions that enable long-term monitoring of Io over a variety of time scales (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years); and 4) expanded time for Io observation on ground-based 8- to 10-m class telescopes, particularly those with nighttime Adaptive Optics capability.\\" References Further reading * * External links * Category:Volcanoes of Io (moon) Category:Active volcanoes Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Zamama (volcano)"},{"id":"45260123","text":"Edward a'Beckett (16 April 1836 - 25 March 1922) was an Australian cricketer.

Between 1990 and 1993 he served as Oberb√ºrgermeister of Rostock. Life Klaus Kilimann was born in East Prussia. His father was a railway worker. He began attending primary school in Ortelsburg, his birthplace, which was at the time in Germany. By the time the Red army arrived in January 1945 most of the population had fled, however, and in 1944 or 1945 Kilimann was among the millions of Germans forcibly relocated in a westward direction. The family ended up in Neukloster not far from Rostock in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany, and it was here that he concluded his primary education and then attended a secondary school till 1956. From 1956 Kilimann attended the University of Rostock from where he emerged in 1961 with a degree in Physics. He then undertook post- graduate studies at Moscow State University till 1963, when he returned to Rostock and took a university post as a research assistant at the Mathematics department. He transferred to the Physics department in 1964 which was also the year in which he received his doctorate. He remained at the university as a senior research assistant from 1970 till 1979, having in 1978 produced his Habilitation dissertation on a topic in theoretical physics.His habilitation dissertation was entitled \\"Zwei-Teilchen-Zust√§nde in Fermisystemen mit Coulombwechselwirkung\\". Any reader who understands enough about theoretical physics (and can follow the German) is invited to insert a translation. Between 1980 and 1990 he was employed as an associate professor. During that period, however, for three years from 1982 he was based in Nicaragua, helping to set up a Physics education department at an academy in the capital, Managua.Klaus Kilimann: Deutsch-Deutsche Beziehungen im Sandinistischen Nicaragua, in: Erika Harzer, Willi Volks (Hrsg.): Aufbruch nach Nicaragua, Ch. Links, Berlin, 2009, In October 1989 Klaus Kilimann became a member of New Forum in Rostock. New Forum was a quasi-political party, sometimes described as a \\"citizens' initiative\\", that emerged during the second half of 1989 in the context of growing civil unrest in the country. As a member, Kilimann participated locally in the legal committee set up within the wider context of the Round Table discussions that were established in various parts of the country as part of what was now becoming known as East Germany's Peaceful Revolution. In January 1990, having quit New Forum, Kilimann joined the newly (in East Germany) re-formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) which had till October 1989 been effectively muted following the creation in 1946 of the East German Socialist Unity Party. In October 1990, with the formal reunification of East and West Germany, the East German SDP and (hitherto West German) SPD merged, which made Kilimann a member of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). On 31 May 1990 Klaus Kilimann was elected Lord Mayor of Rostock in succession to Christoph Kleemann. He resigned the office three and a half years later on 3 December 1993, following reports on race riots targeting asylum-seekers, fourteen months earlier, in August 1992. The reports concluded that local police chiefs and political leaders had permitted tensions to fester and then failed act quickly and decisively when rioting broke out. Kilimann himself had been out of town when the riots started and returned from his break only as the violence reached its third night. After his resignation Kilimann was unemployed for a period till September 1994. From 1994 till his retirement in 2005 Klaus Kilimann worked on a succession of consultancy projects on behalf of the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development. The consultancy work took him to Saint Petersburg, Moscow and Kyrgyzstan.

She is best known for her bestselling memoir, Angels in My Hair (2008). A Message of Hope from the Angels (2012) and Love from Heaven (2014) debuted at No. 1 on the UK Sunday Times Book Chart. Her books have been translated into 30 languages and published in over 50 countries. Byrne says that she sees angels and spirits physically on a daily, continuous basis. She has been featured in many media outlets, including the BBC, CNN, The Economist, The Observer, and the Daily Telegraph.  Biography  = Early life = Byrne was born in Dublin, and grew up in poverty in the Dublin suburbs of Kilmainham and Ballymun. She relates that she has seen angels since she was a baby. \\"I see angels physically and I have done so since I was a baby. I know this is hard to believe, and I know that there are some people who will never believe me, regardless of what I say or do. I have no idea why I see angels and others don‚Äôt; I am just an ordinary woman. When I have asked the angels around me about this, their reply has simply been ‚ÄúWhy not you?‚Äù She was labeled as \\"retarded\\" when very young, and speculates that this might be because she was so often in her own world. Lorna's childhood was challenging for many reasons, including difficult family relations because Lorna was often observed as different resulting in something of an ‚Äòoutsider‚Äô status. Despite a specific learning difficulty that makes it hard for someone to learn to read, write and spell correctly, as well as a misconception as to her learning capabilities, Lorna has achieved many things. = Marriage and children = Byrne married Joe in 1976. She relates that when she was young an angel showed her a vision of the man she would marry, and told her they would be happy and have children, but that she would need to care for him and that he would die young. Their married life was spent in a cottage near Maynooth, in Co. Kildare. They had four children. As she conveys having been told, Joe was often in poor health, and he died in 2000. = Public life = Byrne has said that the angels told her many years ago that she would write of them. \\"When I was a child the angels used to tell me I would write about God and them,\\" she has said, \\"but I didn't used to take any notice of them‚Ä¶ but even when Angel Michael said to me that it is getting near your time I was telling him, 'Stop pestering me. How does God expect me to write a book when I can't read or write at all?' He said help would be sent to me. And it was.\\" \\"It filled me with fear of being laughed at and ridiculed,\\" she has said. \\"But right from when I was a child the angels told me that my story would go all around the world, that it would be a bestseller, though they did not use those words.\\"  Writing  Angels in My Hair is a memoir of her early and married life. Stairways to Heaven (2010) is a memoir of life after the death of her husband, including the story of writing her first book and becoming a public figure. She states that it contains many details of how angels work in the world. A Message of Hope from the Angels is about the importance of hope \\"in these challenging times\\". Love from Heaven (2014) introduced the topic of what she describes as a lack of love in the world today, and discusses the importance of loving oneself, which she says is necessary for being able to love others. She also stated for the first time that she sees the force of love as she does angels. The Year With Angels (2016) helps readers to recognise their spiritual side through the different seasons of the year, and includes photographs of Ireland in the four seasons. Angels at my Fingertips (2017) is a sequel to Angels in my Hair, containing descriptions of events throughout Byrne's life and taking her autobiographical writing up to 2017. It contains descriptions of visionary experiences of historical figures and detailed exercises for connecting to guardian angels. A book on prayer, Prayers from the Heart, was published in 2018. This includes advice on how to pray, and prayers for many situations. My Guardian Angel, My Best Friend (2020) is a book of stories for children, inspired by real life, written to remind children they each have a guardian angel. Illustrations in the book are by Aideen Byrne, Lorna's daughter. Byrne regularly writes a newsletter for e-mail subscribers and posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and from 2013 till 2017 also blogged for The Huffington Post.  Charitable work  In 2015, Byrne established the Lorna Byrne Children's Foundation, which supports the work of charities helping children in need. Funds the Foundation raises are currently split between UNICEF Ireland, which is supporting children affected by the Syrian Civil War; APA ‚Äî A Partnership with Africa, which supports the self- empowerment of women and children in Ethiopia and Tanzania; and in Limerick, Narrative 4, which uses the power of storytelling to grow empathy in children and help them improve their lives and communities, and the Childrens' Grief Centre, which supports children experiencing loss by bereavement of parental separation. From 2015 until 2017, Blue Box Creative Learning Centre, which provides art therapy was funded. Money is raised through public donations and speaking events. The Seraph Foundation has purchased a Georgian manor house, requiring restoration, near Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, to develop what it describes as a \\"Sanctuary\\" for workshops and residential retreats, where people will be able learn from Lorna Byrne and grow spiritually.  Travel and peace work  Since becoming a well-known author, Byrne has engaged in book tours, and has spoken in other contexts to many public audiences across Europe and the United States. She has travelled repeatedly to the United States, a country she believes is pivotal in the future of the world. In 2011, Byrne expressed her support for Occupy Wall Street. In 2014, she attended the UN Climate Summit and the People's Climate March. In 2014 and 2015, much of her work was devoted to fostering unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims in America, which Byrne believes is important in influencing American foreign policy in the Middle East. In February 2014, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Betty Williams joined Byrne at the Sufi Mosque at Tribeca for a prayer event for unity among Muslims. Media appearances in the United States have included a 2012 interview on CNN, and interviews in 2010 and 2012 on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Byrne has travelled to be a subject in two full-scale documentaries: the American production The Lady Who Sees Angels, which was directed by Ted Yacucci and released in 2015; and, to raise funds for the Lorna Byrne Children's Foundation, an Irish production filmed in Ethiopia, The Future belongs to the Young, directed by Hugh Chaloner and released in 2017. In 2014 she stated that the war in Syria had the potential to spread, and poses a great danger to the rest of the world. She has organised a day of prayer for peace in Syria.  Views and beliefs  = Spiritual views and beliefs = Byrne says that she sees physically and communicates with angels on a day-to-day basis. She most strongly emphasizes, and is best known to the public for saying, that everyone regardless of belief has a guardian angel, who loves the person they protect, never leaves their side for an even a moment, and can be asked for help. The guardian angel can also allow other angels to help the person in their life. Some of the angels Byrne has written about talking to are those of the Abrahamic religions: for example, Michael, Gabriel, and Elijah. However, she emphasizes that the angels appear to her in forms she would be comfortable with as a Catholic, and that they would appear to people from other cultures and religions in forms that would be comfortable for them. She has said that she has seen Archangel Gabriel dressed as \\"what we might call today,\\" a biker. In Love from Heaven, she stated that most people lock the love they have inside them. She writes that it is vital to love oneself, and that one is unable to love others if one does not love oneself. Byrne states that all religions have access to God, and no person should think theirs better than the others. She maintains that God and the angels would like all religions to worship together, each according to their own understanding, none trying to convert the others. \\"It needs to become normal for all of us, regardless of our education, our status in life or our method or place of prayer, to come together with open hearts ‚Äî without any agenda ‚Äî to pray to God in whatever way feels appropriate to us.\\" She has talked and written about the importance and power of prayer, and of recognising hope in the world and in everyone's own lives. = Views on public matters = Inspired by what she says angels have told her, Byrne has expressed views on matters of public concern. She has made statements on the environment, saying that, \\"Far too many decisions that affect our environment are tainted by greed and lobbying of special interests. We are all required to stand up and to make sure our leaders at neighbourhood, community, regional, national and international level know we care about this planet and our environment, and will hold them accountable.\\" The underpinning for activity to protect the environment should be love: \\"We all need to wake up and be more aware of the beauty and the gifts of nature that surround us. If we do not appreciate and love nature's incredible beauty, there is no way we will be prepared to do what is required to protect it.\\" Byrne has said that particular attention should be paid to repairing the damage to the ozone layer. Failure to do so will make other challenges such as combating poverty and disease much harder. The means by which this challenge is met are important: \\"It will not be solved if people are just out for themselves or wish to make unjust profit out of the process.\\" She has also expressed opposition to fracking in all circumstances. She believes trees should be planted in very large numbers, as a long-term contribution to the environment. Byrne has written that children have birthrights which should be upheld, among them the rights \\"to be a child\\", \\"to be treated equally\\", to have food and water\\", \\"to breathe clean air\\", \\"to be born into a peaceful world\\", \\"to a full education\\", \\"to full medical care\\". To these ends, individuals need to \\"stand up for children and demand that our government, leaders and international institutions do the right thing by children, and hold these authorities to account if they don't\\".  Reception  Reaction to Byrne's statement that she sees angels and spirits has been varied, ranging from scepticism and disbelief to belief and endorsement. In 2009, Tariq Ramadan recommended Angels in My Hair in Foreign Policy. In 2014, Byrne met and was endorsed by the theologian Matthew Fox. John L. Esposito, professor of International Relations and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University, said, \\"A Message of Hope from the Angels offers a message of hope that speaks to the crises and everyday problems that many struggle with in today‚Äôs world.\\" John Carty, an endorphin release therapist, said Byrne's ability to see energy in the human body has helped him in his work. Larry Dossey, MD., NY Times bestselling author, writes, ‚ÄúSince recorded history, certain individuals have sensed, seen, and conversed with angelic presences. Since we are appallingly ignorant about the nature of consciousness, it is premature to dismiss these reports as fantasies, which is too often done. Lorna Byrne‚Äôs ‚ÄòAngels in my Hair‚Äô is captivating. It is both a challenge to skeptics and an inspiration to those whose experiences confirm transcendental realities.‚Äù Michael Alper, author of The \\"God\\" Part of the Brain, related his opinion in 2012, \\"Either a) she actually believes it, or b) she is a complete charlatan. There is no option c) ‚Äì that she would be talking to angels. Human beings are simply genetically predisposed to believe in some kind of spiritual reality.\\" Byrne's response to her critics is often a reminder of free will: \\"I am not here to force anyone to believe, or say you have to listen, but maybe you should listen to me and open to the possibility that you really do have a guardian angel.\\"  Books  * 2008 Angels in my Hair.

His signature beat is from the single, \\"Type Of Way\\" by Rich Homie Quan. He has worked with artists such as French Montana, Rich Kidz, and Big K.R.I.T. Early life and career Ever since Carter was young, he had a passion for music. He was interested in R&B; and old school rap. He played the drums in his middle school band and started to make beats in the eighth grade. He didn't play the drums in high school, because he didn't like their band. Soon after, he started to do his own thing in music. He started to take music more seriously after he graduated from Westside High school and went to college at The Art Institute. Carter's roommate was into making beats as well, and would spend more than five hours a day on the computer making beats. At first, Carter wanted to engineer and record for artists, but after seeing his roommates' work, it inspired him to start record producing. In 2011, Carter dropped out of college and started to engineer and record for people, but he wasn't making the kind of money that he wanted to. With no other job, he started to sell his beats. His cousin Yung Jonez, used to criticize his music. Just to impress his cousin, Carter kept trying to make his beats sounds better. As Yung Carter's beats started to improve, Yung Jonez started to like his music. They developed a music chemistry with each other. In May 2012, Carter sent rapper Rich Homie Quan eight beats to listen to. Rich Homie later told Carter on Instagram, that he made a song with one of the beats he sent him. The specific beat ended up being the song \\"All I Need\\" from the Still Goin In mixtape. It wasn't until Rich Homie sent him the track, that Carter was proud that his beats were being used. He also produced the \\"Investments\\" track from the same mixtape. He used a sample from a Luther Vandross song. Carter originally made the beat for Yung Jonez, but Jonez thought it was a good idea to send it to Rich Homie instead. In November, Carter made the beat to \\"Type Of Way\\" and sent it to Rich Homie. In December, Rich Homie Quan got back to him and it ended up being on the Still Goin In: Reloaded mixtape. Carter is often in Atlanta recording with different artists to get recognition and to make himself known in the music business.

Biography His father was a gilder. He appears to have taken his first formal art lessons in the workshop of Pasqual Bailon Savall (c.1650-1691), a native of Berga like his father. Bailon's early death led Viladomat to become apprenticed with Joan Baptista Perramon (c.1664-1743).Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. He remained with him for at least six years; possibly nine. After that, he worked on the Church of San Miguel (demolished in 1868) with the painter and architect, Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena. By this means, he became acquainted with Italian art. In 1723, his opposition to the strict regimen imposed by the \\"Colegio de Pintores\\" (a Medieval-style painter's guild) led him to file a lawsuit so he could obtain the title of \\"licensed painter\\" and work freely. His suit was successful, but continued conflict led him to file another suit to retain the title in 1739.Biography and appreciation @ the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana. Saint Anthony (1720) His long career enabled him to paint at almost all the convents and monasteries in Barcelona. His cycle of twenty paintings on the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, originally created for the old Franciscan monastery from 1722 to 1724, are now in the collection of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (National Art Museum of Catalonia). This was his primary claim to fame and, together with a cycle of forty paintings on the Stations of the Cross and the Virgin Mary in the , constitute the majority of his preserved works. Some paintings historically attributed to him, at the Old Hospital de la Santa Creu and the Jesuit Church in Tarragona, have recently come into question. In addition to painting, he taught drawing in his workshop. Apprenticeships there were eagerly sought after. His son, Josep Viladomat i Esmandia (1722-1786), also became a painter. He was best known for a cycle of paintings (in his father's style) on the life of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

The son of a peasant family from Curtea de Arge»ô, he attended the University of Bucharest, followed by doctoral studies in psychology at Leipzig University under Wilhelm Wundt. Following World War I, he became a professor at the newly founded University of Cluj, emerging as a pioneer in experimental psychology in Romania over the ensuing decades. He led the university between 1932 and 1940, also serving in government for a time. An assassination attempt against him in 1938 precipitated the killing of Iron Guard leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. After 1945, he initially worked with the new communist government, but his insistence on an apolitical teaching environment ultimately saw him held at Sighet prison from 1950 to 1955, and he died three years after his release. Biography =Education and research= Born in Curtea de Arge»ô, his parents Ion and Maria were landed peasants (mo»ôneni) who owned a mill and an apiary. He attended primary school in his native town,Popa, p.54 followed by Matei Basarab High School in the national capital Bucharest. After graduation in 1899, he entered the University of Bucharest, where he studied literature and philosophy, earning a degree in 1904. For the next several years, he taught Romanian language and philosophy at high schools in Craiova and then Gala»õi. In 1908, he married Elena Papadopol, the daughter of a very wealthy family of Greek descent from the latter city. The same year, with his wife's money and accompanied by her, he left for Leipzig University to pursue a doctorate.Popa, p.55NastasƒÉ, p.35 He specialized in experimental psychology and studied under Wilhelm Wundt, who endorsed his doctorate in 1911. This work dealt with color and affective response. In 1919, he became a professor at the newly established Romanian University of Cluj, situated in the capital of Transylvania, which had recently united with Romania at the close of World War I. His favorite students would be Liviu Rusu and Nicolae MƒÉrgineanu.Popa, p.57 In 1927, he established an experimental psychology laboratory, which became a separate institute the following year, the first of its kind in Romania. In 1929, he founded a publishing house for the institute, which brought out 34 monographs, mainly doctoral theses defended at the institute. In 1931, he laid the foundation for a psychology society divided into four sections: educational psychology, behavioral economics, legal psychology and medical psychology. Thanks to him, the journal Revista de psihologie teoreticƒÉ »ôi aplicatƒÉ appeared between 1938 and 1949. He helped introduce psychological records for pupils in schools throughout the country, to set up a psychological service for CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne railway carrier, and to found psycho-technical institutes at Cluj and Bucharest, as well as professional development offices at Arad, Bra»ôov and Cluj. Among his more noteworthy books are Selec»õiunea capacitƒÉ»õilor »ôi orientarea profesionalƒÉ (\\"Ability Selection and Professional Orientation\\"; 1929), Instabilitatea emotivƒÉ (\\"Emotional Instability\\"; 1936), Constitu»õie biopsihicƒÉ »ôi criminalitate (\\"Biophysical Makeup and Criminality\\"; 1938), Adaptarea socialƒÉ (\\"Social Adaptation\\"; 1938), Educa»õia copiilor inferior »ôi superior dota»õi (\\"The Education of Poorly and Richly Gifted Children\\"; 1939) and MƒÉsurarea inteligen»õei (\\"The Measure of Intelligence\\"; 1940). A eugenicist, he was a prominent advocate of selecting students and curricula based on class identity, which he asserted was tied to mental development.Bucur, p.161 =University administrator and government official= He served as rector of Cluj University between 1932 and 1940.Rusan (1997), p.313 As such, he played a prominent role in the building of an Academic College. \\"Colegiul Academic al UniversitƒÉ≈£ii clujene (Casa Universitarilor)\\" at the Babe»ô-Bolyai University site More broadly, his rectorial term coincided with the Great Depression and a serious shortfall in university funding, so that he consistently used his position to call for budgetary increases.Pu»ôca»ô, p.177, 202 As early as 1924, when Sextil Pu»ôcariu proposed inviting Lucian Blaga to teach at Cluj, he stood in opposition due to a wish to bring in one of his own students.Popa, p.68 Antipathies toward Blaga's literary style and philosophical outlook among the faculty, led by Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ and seconded by »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ, continued for years. By 1935, a press campaign was calling on Blaga to be admitted as a professor, but »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ was rumored to be holding the position for his student Rusu.NastasƒÉ, p.143-44 He finally relented in 1938, when Blaga was hired to lecture on the philosophy of culture.Pu»ôca»ô, p.276 Meanwhile, a special department of modern Romanian culture had been created for Octavian Goga in 1936.NastasƒÉ, p.146 A member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), he was undersecretary of state at the Education Ministry between 1936 and 1937, serving under Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu.NastasƒÉ, p.147 According to his own account, he was brought into government in order to restore order into a university system that was plagued by disturbances and terror from the Iron Guard. For acting against the group, its leadership decided he should die. In November 1938, a wave of Guardist terrorism led the Cluj police chief to order round- the-clock protection for »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ. In response to the consequent arrest of over forty members, the Guard activated its plan to eliminate him. On the afternoon of 28 November, while he was walking to class, a group of five assassins fired five shots at him. Three hit the professor, who survived but lay bedridden for four months.ArƒÉdƒÉvoaice et al., p.65 The policeman who was accompanying him was killed on the spot. The shooting was used by King Carol II as a pretext to retaliate against the Guard. Two days later, fourteen of its most prominent members, including its leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, were taken from their prison and shot dead on a deserted road.Sachar, p.97 When the university had to withdraw to Sibiu in 1940 as a result of the Second Vienna Award, he organized its orderly transition to another city, although himself settled in Bucharest, working at a government ministry.Popa, p.64 When the university moved back to Cluj in 1945, he resumed teaching there, to the acclaim of students and faculty. =Postwar course= In spite of his anti- communist reflexes, he sided with Salvator Cupcea and Alexandru Ro»ôca in pushing for MƒÉrgineanu's dismissal from the faculty, hoping to save his own position and initially gaining favor with the Romanian Communist Party. In his memoirs, MƒÉrgineanu noted he had concealed from his mentor the presence of Ro»ôca among his would-be assassins, and the involvement of both men, while Guard members, in the campaign against him. »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ was very active in the Cluj Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union chapter. He insisted on hosting the founding meeting in his own home (his wife's property), later putting up a plaque reminding viewers of Romania's struggle alongside the USSR in the closing period of World War II. He defected from the PNL to the Communist-allied National Liberal Party‚ÄìTƒÉtƒÉrescu, and headed the candidate list for Giurgiu in the 1946 election, winning a seat in the Assembly of Deputies.

History The now uninhibited village of ƒ¶al-Millieri was first documented in 1419 though it originates from Roman or even pre-historic times. The present church was built around 1450 on the site of an earlier 13th century chapel.Ayling, Elizabeth. \\"Feast & Frescoes\\", Malta inside out. Retrieved on 30 January 2015. The Annunciation Chapel at ƒ¶al-Millieri was most probably used as a Mosque when originally built. Its architecture supports this view; the apse was probably a qibla and the building points more or less to Mecca. Studies on the skeletal remains, of those buried in the medieval period, revealed evidence of the probable first cases of syphilis in Malta.Savona-Ventura, C. (2003). Devotees of Venus: A History of Sexuality in Malta . DISCERN: Institute for Research on the Signs of the Times. Malta. p. 16. The chapel was consecrated in 1480. During Monsignor Pietro Dusina's apostolic visit to ƒ¶al-Millieri, in 1575, he found that there were a total of four churches in the area. Only two of these remain standing; The Annunciation and St John the Evangelist. During his visit, Dusina found that the church was in a state of good repair, had three altars and paved. However, he found that the church was not equipped with sacred vestments, income or even a rector. At his order the side altars were removed. In 1781, Archbishop Vincenzo Labini visited the chapel but found it to be in a neglected state. In the early 19th century, ƒ†uze Magro from ≈ªurrieq restored the church. It was blessed by Reverend Gejtan Buttigieg in 1809. By time the chapel fell in disrepair until 1968 when the 'Teenagers Din l-Art Helwa' began cleaning the chapel. It has been recorded that upon cleaning, at least thirteen trucks worth of rubble and debris were removed.\\"Chapel of the Annunciation, Hal-Millieri, Zurrieq\\", Din l-Art Helwa, Malta, 10 October 2011.

Retrieved on 30 January 2015. Frescos During the restoration a number of frescos were discovered on the wall. They date from the middle of the 15th century. The frescoes cover all the interior walls of the chapel except the apse. The frescos represent Saint Nicholas, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saint James, Saint Lawrence, Saint Vincent, Saint Paul, Saint Augustine, Saint Blaise, Saint Agatha and Saint Leonard. Under the fresco of St Blaise and St Agatha one can see the signature of, probably the painter, with the name Garinu. These frescos were whitewashed, probably during the time that it was used as a stable. Restoration was undertaken by Paolo Zanolini in 1978.Spiteri, Mikiel (2000). A Hundred Wayside Chapels of Malta & Gozo, p. 65. Heritage Books, Valletta. . Maintenance of these frescoes is ongoing and over the years has involved institutions such as Courtaulds, Opificio delle Pietre Dure, the Malta University, Museums Department, and the Restoration Centre. Despite the efforts, most of the lower parts of the paintings were lost and so were plastered in natural hues. Architecture and Interior A pathway leads to the chapel and one has to descend three steps to enter. The chapel is built in the late medieval style. The square doors appear to have been originally ogival which is a common characteristic of Gothic architecture. The church has a height of 7.3 metres and a width of 5.2 metres. The interior of the church consists of four pointed arches typical of medieval churches. The arch closest to the altar has the remains of a Rood screen. The church has one altar and includes a painting of the Annunciation above it. It was painted by Ren√® Sacco in 2003. The church also has a number of tombs. Also beside the church a number of graves were discovered.\\"Hal-Millieri chapel open to visitors\\", Times of Malta, Malta, 22 March 2003. Retrieved on 30 January 2015. Archaeological Findings Archaeologists from the University of Malta and of Oxford discovered a number of medieval coins and pieces of pottery. The foundations of the previous 13th century church were discovered. Also it was discovered that the church was built on the foundations of a Roman villa. In the church yard one can see a number of items dating back to Roman times such as the stone olive mortar.Busuttil, Roderick. \\"Il-Kappella tal-Lunzjata - ƒ¶al Millieri limiti ta≈º-≈ªurrieq -\\" , Kappelli Maltin, Malta.

Located some 25,000 light years away, the star is positioned ~7 pc (~23 ly) away from a starburst cluster known as the Quintuplet cluster. It has an ejection nebula measuring over 0.8 pc in diameter, formed 5000-10,000 years ago through large eruptions. The star has a large mass comparable to the Pistol star and a luminosity of ~4,000,000 times the Sun (). This places the star as one of the most massive and luminous stars known. Observational history Quintuplet cluster region centred on the Pistol Star, with V4998 Sgr at top right. The star was first discovered in a 1993 survey that searched for bright near-infrared sources within 0.55¬∞2 of the Galactic Centre. The survey used 1‚Äì20 micron photometry and used a two channel InSb detector on the 1 meter ANU telescope in Australia. 50 objects were targeted and most of them had bolometric magnitudes below -5. The star itself was observed in May 1987. Its Position, JHKLNMQ Magnitudes, Right ascension, Declination, and Silicate absorption were noted. The survey was conducted by Tetsuya Nagata, A. R. Hyland, S. M. Straw, Shuji Sato, and Kimiaki Kawara. The survey named the star NHS93 22, NHS standing for the three leading scientists in the survey (Nagata, Hyland, and Straw); 93 signifying the date of discovery; and 22 indicating that it was the 22nd star observed. The next observation was made by the 2MASS survey, which took place in 1997-2001. The star was designated 2MASS J17460562-2851319 and its position, luminosity, and JHKs magnitudes were catalogued. After that, the star was observed in a 2001 survey called the \\"Study of Long Period Variables stars near the Galactic Centre.\\" The survey named the star GMC2001 10-1, GMC standing for Glass, Matsumoto, and Carter. V4998 Sagittarii was observed in 2003 by the General Catalog of Variable Stars (GCVS) and was designated V4889 Sagittarii, ‚Äò‚ÄôV‚Äô‚Äô indicating that it was a variable star and 4889 denoting its serial number. It was observed by the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope in a 2008 survey covering 2.0 by 1.4 degrees (280 by 210 pc) and was given the name SSTGC 595621. It was also observed by a 2009 near-infrared survey that targeted the Galactic Centre. The star was designated MKN2009 in that survey, MKN standing for the three leading scientists (Matsunaga, Kawadu, and Nishiyama) and 2009 specifying the date of the survey. A narrowband imaging survey of the Galactic centre region conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope, (HST), Near Infrared Camera, (NIC), and Multi Object Spectrometer (NIMCOS) revealed LBV G0. 120-0.048 as a strong source of Paschen-alpha (Paschen-Œ±) which exceeded that of the Pistol star. The star was selected for spectroscopy by a group of astronomers owing to that cause. The survey, which was conducted in 2010, confirmed that the star was a luminous blue variable and the star was named LBV G0.120-0.048, LBV meaning luminous blue variable and G0.120-0.048 standing for its Galactic coordinates. It was also found through the use of PŒ± imaging that the star had a large ejection nebula with a diameter over 0.8 pc which was ejected by it 5000-10,000 years ago through large eruptions. The star's spectrum was studied and it was found that the spectrum was similar to the Pistol star so a mass similar to the Pistol star was derived. The extinction rates were measured and a luminosity of ~4,000,000 was obtained. It also has another name of MNC2010, the name MMC standing for the three leading scientists of the survey, Mauerhan, Morris, and Cotera. The survey took place in 2010, hence the name MMC2010. In 2011, a survey led by Dong, Wang, and Cotera reached for stars in the Galactic centre that emitted Paschen-Œ±. The stars targeted were the ones detected from the HST/NICMOS Paschen-Œ± survey of the Galactic Centre. V4998 Sagittarii was one of the stars observed and it was given another designation of DWC2011 92. The most recent survey was in 2014, when a group decided to study the LBVs in the Quintuplet cluster. The star's nebula's mass was measured at 6.2 . Also measured was the star's temperature and it was found to be 12,000 K. The star was designated LBV3 in that survey because it was the third LBV in the Quintuplet cluster.  Characteristics  V4998 Sgr's high mass compresses its core and accelerates fusion primarily by the CNO cycle which leads to a luminosity of and a temperature of 12000 K. It boasts a large ejection nebula with a diameter of ~0.8 parsec (~2.5 ly) and a mass of . Since comparable nebulae typically last no more than 10,000 years, V4998 Sagittarii is presumed to have undergone a massive eruption 5000-10,000 years ago. The star is a projected ~7 pc (~23 ly) away from the Quintuplet starburst cluster, which lies in the direction of the Galactic center. The cluster contains around 100 O-type stars and several Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars. There are also two other luminous blue variables beside V4998 Sagittarii: the Pistol star and qF362.  Evolution  The star's high mass loss rate combined with its eruptions will strip off its hydrogen layers and expose a hot helium core. It will proceed to the Wolf‚ÄìRayet sequence. It will eventually start fusing heavy elements in its core, and when it develops a large iron core the star will collapse in on itself and explode as a type Ib or Ic supernovae. Depending on the amount of mass lost before the supernova explosion, the remnant will be a neutron star or black hole. A black hole is predicted for the most massive stars such as this one.

Designed for the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) regulations, it is intended as a second option to Onroak's Morgan LMP2 that has been competing since 2012. As well as being the first closed-cockpit car offered by Onroak, it is also the first car they designed entirely in-house. The JS P2 debuted at the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans, and has been campaigned in the FIA World Endurance Championship, European Le Mans Series, Asian Le Mans Series and IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Development Onroak initially planned to develop a car for the Le Mans Prototype 1 category but cancelled these plans to concentrate on the LMP2 category. The design was seen by Onroak as marketable in North America where closed-cockpit designs, which were required for all LMP1 cars, were also prominent choices for LMP2s and Daytona Prototypes in the new United SportsCar Championship. The LMP1 design was therefore evolved into an LMP2 design with measures taken to assure the car met the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) cost limitations in LMP2. The car was designed to be able to utilize available LMP2 engines: Nissan and Judd's naturally aspirated V8 engines and Honda's turbocharged V6 engine. A high downforce sprint design and a low downforce Le Mans setup are offered for the car. Naming of the JS P2 came about through an alliance between Onroak and Guy Ligier's partnership of Equipe Ligier and Automobiles Martini. The JS P2 follows Ligier's naming scheme of his cars being named after French racing driver Jo Schlesser (JS). The partnership included Onroak taking over development of Ligier-Martini's Group CN car. Racing history The Ligier JS P2 of Greaves Motorsport at 24 Hours of Le Mans at Night The JS P2 began initial testing in March 2014. The debut of the first JS P2s was set for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June, where the Ligier name would race for the first time since a Ligier JS2 had finished second overall in . OAK would enter two cars, one backed by Nissan's drivers and engine while the other car featured three Chinese drivers and a Honda powerplant. The third car was purchased by privateers Thiriet by TDS Racing and also used a Nissan engine. The two Nissan JS P2 qualified well, with TDS's car on pole position and the first OAK car in third. All three cars finished the 24 hour endurance with TDS in second and OAK in fifth and seventh places in class. Following Le Mans TDS Racing campaigned their Ligier in the remainder of the European Le Mans Series, but were unable to finish the three races in which they participated. OAK Racing meanwhile brought their Ligier to the United States for the two remaining rounds of the United SportsCar Championship, where Alex Brundle put the Honda- powered JS P2 on pole position on debut at Circuit of the Americas en route to a second-place finish. The Nissan-powered OAK car moved to the FIA World Endurance Championship where it earned five consecutive pole positions in the five remaining races as well as class victories at Fuji Speedway and Shanghai International Circuit. In 2015 the American Krohn Racing team purchased a JS P2 for a partial season in the United SportsCar Championship and a full season in the European Le Mans Series, and will be the first team to utilize Judd power in the Ligier. Michael Shank Racing purchased a Honda-powered JS P2 for a full United SportsCar Championship campaign, and won pole position at the Rolex 24 at Daytona.

It was one of the four tramways of Kazakhstan which continuously operated from their opening dates. The network went into decline starting in the late 20th century, with most of its former routes closed by 2010. Operation of the remaining tram network was halted and indefinitely suspended on 31 October 2015. History Almaty's older tramcars uses a mixture of panto-graph & bow collector Like other Kazakh towns and cities, Almaty's tram system was also opened directly as an electric tram. It never ran horse or steam trams. Many changes of rolling stock occurred, and recently new modern low floor trams were introduced. The first tram ran here on 1 December 1937. The electric tramway began operation in 1937 with four routes, which included one ring line. The tram network reached at peak ten routes in 1990. The decline of the network began in 2000, when 8 routes were phased out through 2010. Operation on the final two tram routes was indefinitely suspended on 31 October 2015 due to accidents, required network maintenance, and the unprofitability of the tramway. Tram routes Previous to 1991, there had been 10 tram routes in operation. But like many Asian cities, most of the routes were closed between 1991 and 2010. Before the indefinite suspension of service in October 2015, there were two remaining operational tram routes: * 4 ‚Äì Zhetysuyskaya‚ÄìAksay * 6 ‚Äì Zhetysuyskaya‚ÄìOrbita Fleet Tatra KT4 tram is exiting from depot Almaty main tram depot Most tramcars were Tatra models. These were KT4Ds from Berlin and T4Ds from other German cities. Older models used a bow collector, but newer models used a pantograph. While the city of Almaty earlier reported having 28 trams, by the time of the network's closure in 2015 there were only 12 remaining trams (of which only 7 were operational). Character of network Both of Almaty's remaining tram lines ran on unreserved tracks and middle of the roads with automobiles. Passenger numbers In 2003 the system carried 19.7 million passengers. This number fell to 12.9 million in 2006, 4 million in 2009, to just 1.3 million in 2013. It briefly increased afterwards and in 2015 the number was 4 million. The passenger turnover per kilometer also dramatically dropped and was just 1/10th the value in 2013 than it was in 2003.https://web.archive.org/web/20161113190319/http://www.stat.gov.kz/getImg?id=ESTAT099965 Criticism Tram tracks being dismantled in Zharokova Street (2018) Before the indefinite suspension of service, trams in Almaty were no longer an important means of transport within the city. Most tram routes had been closed during 1991 to 2010 due to construction and opening of metro network, though Line 1 of the metro opened only in 2011. However, the two tram routes that had remained in operation had gotten new fresh rolling stocks for a speedier service in 2013. For that reason there was much criticism from the public for suspending the service entirely after the recent purchase of new stock.

Considered to be one of the founding fathers of American abstraction, he was one of the first artists to introduce concepts of the Bauhaus school within the United States. His mature style encompassed both nonobjective and figurative work and the emotional content of this work was consistently more expressive than formal. Drewes was as highly regarded for his printmaking as for his painting. In his role as teacher as well as artist he was largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America. Early life and education Drewes was born in 1899 to Georg Drewes, a Lutheran pastor, and Martha Schaefer Drewes. The family lived in the village of Canig within Lower Lusatia, Germany. From age eight to eighteen he attended the Saldria Gymnasium, a boarding school in Brandenburg an der Havel. There, he showed talent both for painting and woodblock printing. Graduating from Saldria in 1917, he was drafted by the German army and served in France from then until the close of the war. About this period of his life he is reported to have said that the horrors of life at the front were only made tolerable by his sketchbook, a copy of Goethe's Faust and a volume of Nietzsche. For a decade following the close of the war he studied, made paintings and prints, and traveled widely. His friend, Herwarth Walden, helped shape his appreciation for expressionist literature and art. Walden produced the quarterly magazine, Der Sturm and ran a gallery of contemporary art, Galerie Der Sturm, from which, in 1919, Drewes purchased an expressionist painting by William Wauer titled Blutrausch (Bloodlust). In the same year he made the acquaintance of Heinrich Vogeler and participated in Vogeler's socialist utopian artists' commune, Barkenhoff, at Worpswede, Lower Saxony. In 1919 Drewes also enrolled at the K√∂niglich Technischen Hochschule Charlottenburg to study architecture and the following year he studied the same subject at the Technischen Hochschule Stuttgart. Preferring art over architecture, he then enrolled in Stuttgart's school of applied arts (Kunstgewerbeschule) where he studied life drawing and learned to work with colored glass. At this time he joined a group of artists and architects associated with the newly formed Merz Akademie, a college of design, art, and media in Stuttgart. In 1921 his friendship with a French artist, S√©bastien Laurent, led him to begin studies in Weimar at Bauhaus, then a new school which taught an integrated approach to the fine and applied arts. His instructors were Johannes Itten and Lyonel Feininger, whose paintings were expressionist and abstract, and Paul Klee, who taught bookbinding, stained glass, and murals. While at Bauhaus Drewes produced a portfolio of ten woodblock prints entitled \\"Ecce Homo.\\" In 1923 and 1924 he studied art during travels throughout Italy, Spain, the United States, and Central America and in 1926 he traveled to San Francisco, Japan, and Korea, thence taking the Trans-Siberian railway to Manchuria, Moscow, and Warsaw. He later said the El Grecos he saw proved to be most influential in his work. While traveling, he exhibited: (1) etchings in Madrid (1923) and Montevideo (1924), (2) oils and etchings in Buenos Aires and St. Louis (1925), and (3) etchings in San Francisco (1926). He paid his way by the sales these exhibits produced and by taking commissions to paint portraits. While in San Francisco he set up a shop from which he sold prints he had made in Spain and South America. After his return to Germany in 1927 he resumed study at Bauhaus, which had been forced to relocate in Dessau, Saxony-Anhalt. His instructors at that time were L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy (metal work), Wassily Kandinsky, and (painting), and Lyonel Feininger (prints). At this time he also worked and exhibited in Frankfurt. With the rise of Nazism abstract artists found it increasingly difficult to sell their work and, in 1930, Drewes, finding the political pressure unbearable, emigrated to the United States. There, despite the world economic crisis, Drewes was able to earn a living as a professional artist. Mature style After Drewes moved to New York, Kandinsky, who was both friend and mentor, continued to exert a strong influence over his style. Later in life he said he had a hard time getting away from Kandinsky's influence as he developed his own style. In time he was able to bring a more emotional approach to his work and to base it, more than Kandinsky did, on natural forms. In 1930 Drewes had a solo exhibition at the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library and a two-person show at the S.P.R. Penthouse Gallery (with Carl Sprinchorn). Also in that year Kandinsky introduced Drewes to Katherine Dreier, co-founder of the Society of Independent Artists and Soci√©t√© Anonyme. In 1931 Drewes participated in the Soci√©t√© Anonyme's exhibition at the Albright Art Center, Buffalo, New York and the Rand School. That year he showed prints and paintings first in a solo- and then in a two- person exhibition at the Morton Gallery (the latter with Herbert Reynolds Kniffin) and he also exhibited in group shows at the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Brownell-Lamberton Galleries, and the Pynson Printers Galleries. These exhibitions established pattern, as Drewes's work would be shown multiple times a year throughout the 1930s and 1940s. From the first, Drewes's work captured the attention of the New York critics. A critic for The New York Times called attention to the subtle treatment in cityscape paintings he exhibited in the dual show with Carl Sprinchorn, noting that they \\"look fragile, as if they were made from reflections of the city in a soap bubble, rather than from life.\\" In reviewing his solo show at the Morton Gallery, another Times critic praised his work as \\"solid.\\" She said \\"though the paint is put on in much the same quick fashion,\\" as the cityscapes at S.P.R. Penthouse, \\"the composition has something that keeps it from breaking as if touched.\\" Of his solo show at the Morton Gallery Margaret Breuning, the critic for the New York Evening Post praised the \\"crisp vigor\\" of his portraits, his skill at handling the form and color of a still life, and the \\"well developed\\" and \\"imaginative\\" choice of viewpoint in a landscape. \\"One hopes,\\" she wrote, \\"and confidently expects to see more work from this young artist.\\" In reviewing the dual exhibition with Herbert Reynolds Kniffin, \\"T.C.L.\\" of the Times called Drewes \\"an artist of promise\\" wrote of his \\"dynamic quality, an apparent fluency and economy of means,\\" and said \\"he paints with sureness and vigor, with suggestion rather than in detail.\\" Of this exhibition, the critic for the New York Sun wrote, \\"Mr. Drewes is an imaginative painter who is worth watching. He has emotions and they take hold of him and lead him at times into paintings that are highly unconventional. As a thousand forces are at work in America today trying to make all the artists conform to set patterns, this ability to withstand influences is a distinct asset.\\" Howard Devree of The New York Times praised the oils, watercolors, and drawings that Drewes showed in his solo exhibition at the Morton Galleries in 1933. He said the works gave the gallery \\"a radiantly prismatic aspect.\\" He described some of the landscapes as heavily patterned, others as free and impressionistic and considered his drawings to be vigorous. In 1934 Drewes began a long career as a teacher when he took a position teaching drawing and printmaking at the Brooklyn Museum Art School funded by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration. He later said he modeled his teaching method on the one that Kandinsky used. Drewes recalled that Kandinsky was a patient and nonjudgmental teacher who would challenge his students to work out their own solutions to non-objective projects he would set and ask them to discuss the reasons behind their choices. In 1936, the year he became an American citizen, Drewes became a founding member of both the anti-fascist American Artists' Congress and the avant-garde American Abstract Artists group. That year he also was given a ten-year retrospective exhibition at the Uptown Gallery, and participated in group shows held by Soci√©t√© Anonyme (at Black Mountain College in North Carolina) and the Municipal Art Committee of New York.In 1934 Mayor Fiorello La Guardia appointed a Municipal Art Committee to advise City government on ways to stimulate New York‚Äôs cultural life during the hardships of the Great Depression. The Committee used funds from the Works Progress Administration, the emergency Relief Bureau, and a number of foundations. (Source: Department of Cultural Affairs, City of New York ) In 1937 he participated in the first group exhibitions of the two organizations he had helped to found: a showing of approximately 250 members of the American Artists Congress in the International Building, Rockefeller Center, and another of the 39 members of American Abstract Artists in the Squibb Galleries. Of the former, a critic singled out a painting of his as a \\"well deliberated\\" contribution to among those that were non-objective among the polemical and Social-Realist figurative works in the show. In 1937 Drewes also exhibited at the East River Gallery in an innovative program that gave potential buyers the option of renting a work while deciding whether or not to buy it.In 1936, Marian Guthrie Willard had founded the East River Gallery as an art rental gallery at 358 East 57 St. As Willard became \\"more and more interested in the development of individual artists\\" the idea of renting became less and less appealing and she officially closed the East River Gallery in 1938 to re-evaluate her direction. During the same eventful year a prominent architect, Wallace Harrison, helped Drewes obtain a position at the School of Architecture of Columbia University. He remained there for the next three years teaching painting, drawing, and printmaking while also making prints for the Graphic Arts Division of the WPA Federal Art Project in New York. Werner Drewes, \\"In the Blue Space,\\" 1938, oil on canvas 35‚Öû x 41¬æ in. (91.2 x 106.1 cm), Smithsonian American Art Museum, gGift of the artist, 1975 Drewes's 1939 exhibition at the Artists' Gallery attracted the notice of New York critics. Jerome Klein in the New York Post said \\"he handles the vocabulary of 'non-objective' art with the sophistication and assurance of a mature artist who is particularly adept in color relations. In fact there is hardly a spot where his harmony is off the track. And a wide gamut is run from the pale tone of 'Wintry' to the vivid contrasts of 'In the Blue Space.'\\" Similarly, the reviewer for Art News commented on the \\"breadth of scope,\\" the \\"clear eloquent color,\\" and \\"imaginative designs,\\" of his work and recommended the show to \\"anyone who searches for meaning in abstractions.\\" In 1940 Drewes joined with Carl Holty to open an art school called the Department of Abstract Art at the Master Institute of United Arts. Like Drewes, Holty was a founding member of American Abstract Artists and, at the time the school opened, both men were showing works at an exhibition held by that group at the Riverside Museum. The institute and museum were both housed in a 29-story Art-Nouveau apartment building on the upper west side.The Master Institute building was built by Louis Horch. He was a wealthy financier who, in 1923, had backed Nicholas Roerich and provided the money for the founding of the Master Institute and what was then called the Roerich Museum. In the mid-1930s Horch withdrew his support from Roerich and, following a legal battle, took control of the building. Under Horch, the Riverside Museum was frequently used for exhibitions of American Abstract Artists. (See \\"\\"Once Were Titans: Roerich\\" by Marion Meneker, Art Market Monitor, October 9, 2009, and \\"Roerich Museum to Change Identity,\\" The New York Times, May 14, 1938, p. 19) While teaching at the Institute, Drewes continued as an instructor of drawing and painting at Columbia and held two other positions: director of the WPA/FAP Graphic Arts Project and map maker for the Fairchild Aerial Survey Company. In the 1930s Fairchild Aerial Survey Company used aerial photography to make tax maps and other political maps for cities and towns. In 1940 U.S. Army Air Corps began testing the airplanes and cameras of the company for aerial reconnaissance and the preparation wide-area survey maps.\\"New Aerial Camera for the Army,\\" by Dick Martin, Popular Photography, November 1939, p. 56. In 1941 Howard Devree reviewed a second solo exhibition at Artists Gallery. He wrote that Drewes was a clever artist who could give a human and emotional content to abstract art thus overcoming the sterility that characterized most non-objective art. The gouache, \\"Grids in Space\\" shows the emotional content of which Devree wrote. In 1944 and 1945 Drewes worked at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 in New York City. Together, they improved the intaglio technique in color print- making.Hayter called the method \\"simultaneous color printing.\\" He added color to inked intaglio plates by means such as color-ink-soaked rags, stencils, or rolling a thicker, more viscous ink over a thinner ink, where the thicker ink is rejected and adheres only to the surface surrounding the first ink. Drewes's work continued to appear in group exhibitions throughout the years of World War II and in 1945 a solo exhibition at the Kleemann Gallery attracted unusual critical notice. Edward Alden Jewell of The New York Times observed that his work was not exclusively non-objective but included expressionist abstractions that were based on natural objects. The critic for the New York Sun said this tendency to naturalism was handled \\"lightly and slightly, insisting only on things that seemed essential.\\" Later in the year another Sun critic made the dual aspect of Drewes's work more explicit. Drewes, he said, \\"seems to differ from most confirmed modernists in that he turns at will from the purely abstract to things that at most are semi-abstract, and in one still life painted in the present year he indulges in a degree of objectivity in the fruit and in the half of a wine bottle that is permitted to show that would shock the believers in non-objective art.\\" In 1945 Drewes taught design, printmaking, and photography at Brooklyn College and then shifted to Chicago where he joined with Moholy-Nagy to teach at the Institute of Design.The Institute had been founded in 1937 by Moholy-Nagy as the New Bauhaus and is currently the IIT Institute of Design. (See \\"The History of ID,\\" a web page of the Illinois Institute of Technology Institute of Design In 1946 he joined the faculty of the School of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis. Soon after his arrival he made friends with the German artist, Max Beckmann, who had been hired as an art teacher at the university and who remained there for the next two years. Once settled in St. Louis, Drewes attained a level of financial stability that had until then eluded him. The university promoted him to professor of design and first-year program director and he was thereafter able both to support his family and to devote time to making works of art. In 1948 Dreves was commissioned by the Edward L. Kramer family to paint a mural on the large front of a new house located at 24 Northcote Drive, Brentwood, MO (see figure). He also painted two smaller mural on the wings of the house. A subsequent owner painted over the mural.

Moss Gallery While he lived in St. Louis his work frequently appeared in New York galleries. Reviewing a solo exhibition in 1947, Howard Devree praised his turning \\"from sheer abstraction to well-knit pictures with recognizably representational forms\\" and noted, \\"for years I have watched Werner Drewes in his exploration of the field of abstraction. In his current show at Henry Kleemann's Gallery he reveals that he has not abandoned the quest. Rather, he has extended it. In common with many of the best American painters he has submitted himself to a discipline which is definitely paying off.\\" In 1949 another New York Times critic said he \\"constructs efficient uncompromising designs in aggressive geometrical forms whose separate identity is emphasized by boundaries of harsh, clear color.\\" 1959 Drewes was awarded a purchase prize at the 25th Anniversary National Fine Prints Competition of Associated American Artists. Later life and work Werner Drewes, \\"Autumn Gold,\\" color woodblock, 1969, 23 x 13 inches, Smithsonian American Art Museum, gift of the artist Drewes retired in 1965 and moved to Reston, Virginia, where he remained active as an artist until his death in 1985. He enjoyed great recognition for his work in these later years. In 1984 a large retrospective at the Smithsonian American Art Museum was devoted entirely to his printmaking. A prolific printmaker, Drewes produced during his lifetime some 732 fine prints, including 269 etchings and drypoints, 30 lithographs, 14 celloprints, a lone silkscreen, and 418 woodcuts, of which 255 were in color. \\"Autumn Gold\\" is one of the more colorful of Drewes's non-objective woodblock prints. Family and personal life The information in this section expands upon and partly repeats information given above about Drewes's life. He was born on July 27, 1899, in what was then Canig, Lower Lusatia, Brandenburg, Germany, and is now Kani√≥w, Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland. His name is almost always given as simply Werner Drewes, but his full name was Werner Bernhard Drewes and he is sometimes referred to as Werner B. Drewes. He was the son of Pastor Georg Drewes and his wife Martha Schaefer Drewes. He attended boarding school at the Saldria Gymnasium in Brandenburg an der Havel from 1907 to 1917. At age 18 he was drafted into the German army and served in France, on the Western Front until the end of the war. On returning to civilian life he began to study architecture at the Charlottenburg Technischen Hochschule in Berlin. To support himself, he took a job at the Berlin gas and waterworks. He also spent some time at the Barkenhoff artists' commune. His next place of study was the Technischen Hochschule Stuttgart and then, switching from architecture to the visual arts, he enrolled in Stuttgart's Kunstgewerbeschule and joined the Merz Akademie, also in Stuttgart. He completed his education at Bauhaus, where he studied from 1921 to 1923 in Weimar and from 1927 to 1930 in Dessau. When not attending a school of art, Drewes traveled widely. During 1923 and 1924 he visited places in Italy, Spain, Central America, and the United States and in 1926 he returned to the United States and traveled thence to Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Moscow, and Warsaw. In 1924, while in Madrid, he married Margarete Schrobsdorff, a childhood sweetheart who was also traveling to study art. Margarete had been born on June 16, 1895, in Wust, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Her father was Max Schrobsdorff and her mother, Martha Wreger Schrobsdorff. During their marriage she pursued her own art form of weaving and rug making. On November 22, 1927, the couple gave birth to their first child, a son, Harald and two years later, on January 9, 1929, their second son, Wolfram, was born. In 1930 the family emigrated to the United States and rented an apartment in New York in which to live. At this time Drewes enrolled in the Art Students League. A year later Margarete (now Margaret) gave birth to their third son, Bernard. In 1935 Drewes began his long teaching career with a position at the Brooklyn Museum School and in 1936 he became a citizen of the United States. From the mid-1930s through the 1960s, Drewes flourished both as artist and teacher. Margaret Drewes died in St. Louis on September 27, 1959. A year later Drewes married Mary Louise Lischer Terhune, who, like himself, taught at Washington University in St. Louis. As well as teaching English, she crafted jewelry. In 1965 Drewes retired from Washington University and moved to Point Pleasant, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He moved to Reston, Virginia, in 1972 and died there on June 21, 1985.

It has one unnamed tributary and is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and Class A Wild Trout Waters for part of its length. The creek is crossed by a pipeline and a bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 118. Wisconsinan Ice-Intact Stratified Drift, alluvium, Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale all occur in the surficial geology in the creek's vicinity. Course Fades Creek looking downstream from Pennsylvania Route 118 Fades Creek begins in a valley at the base of a hill in Lake Township. It flows south for a few tenths of a mile before turning southwest and then gradually turning southeast, passing through a pond. The creek continues flowing southeast in a narrow valley for more than a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary from the right and entering the community of Pikes Creek. It then turns south-southeast for nearly a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 118, before turning east-southeast. The creek then crosses Pennsylvania Route 29 and within several hundred feet reaches its confluence with Pikes Creek. Hydrology The concentration of alkalinity in the waters of Fades Creek is 10 milligrams per liter. At its mouth, the peak annual discharge of Fades Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 424 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 775 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 969 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 1543 cubic feet per second. Fades Creek has been contaminated by sediment runoff during wet weather. However, in 2009, Lake Township received a $131,044 to alleviate the problem by repairing Wesley Road and Bear Hollow Road. This project involved raising the grade of Wesley Road and constructing Swales to divert stormwater away from the creek. Geography and geology Fades Creek looking downstream in its upper reaches The elevation near the mouth of Fades Creek is between above sea level. The elevation near the source is between above sea level. Fades Creek is crossed by a pipeline at river mile 1.6. There are three features on the creek that are identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as obstructions. For most of its length, the surficial geology in the vicinity of Fades Creek consists of alluvium, Wisconsinan Ice-Intact Stratified Drift, and resedimented or glacial tills such as Wisconsinan Till and Wisconsinan Bouldery Till. However, bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale also occurs in the surficial geology in the creek's vicinity, as do a few small patches of wetland. Watershed The watershed of Fades Creek has an area of . Fades Creek flows through the United States Geological Survey quadrangles of Harveys Lake and Sweet Valley. The entire length of Fades Creek is in private land. Fades Creek, along with Beaver Run, Pikes Creek, and Harveys Creek, is one of the main sources of flooding in Lake Township. However, these creeks' floods have not caused extensive damage, since the township is relatively undeveloped. History Fades Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1192440. In the early 1900s, the commissioners of Luzerne County requested permission to construct a bridge over a tributary of Fades Creek. This bridge was on a road between the communities of Pikes Creek and Kettle. A concrete slab bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 118 over Fades Creek was constructed in 1932 and repaired in 1960. It is long and is situated in Lake Township near Pennsylvania Route 29. Biology Fades Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout from the pipeline crossing downstream to its mouth. However, wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek throughout its entire length. The creek is also designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery.

It was drained in 1932 with a 4,250 m long tunnel near Plomin to the sea. The surface of the vast green valley was transformed into a fertile field for agriculture. The field's area is around 7 km2 (elevation 24 m), and the Boljunƒçica River flows into it, while from it Ra≈°a River.  History  The lake was located in eastern Istria, on the western and south- western slopes of Mount Uƒçka (to the west of uplift Sisol, elevation 833 m). South of the lake (now filled) is the town Kr≈°an, to the east the ruins of Ko≈æljak Castle, while to the west and north was the Pauline monastery of St. Mary, and the villages of ƒåepiƒá, Kostrƒçani, Brdo Jesenovik, Nova Vas, and ≈†u≈°njevica, mostly inhabited by Istro-Romanians. ƒåepiƒá field seen from Ko≈æljak The lake's area was between 5.4 and 8.6 km2, depending on the precipitation and the water supply from the Boljunƒçica River. Its width was 2.5 km at most, while its length was nearly 4 km. The depth of the lake was between 1 and no more than 2.5 metres. The lake was covered with reed and sedge, and was rich in fish (eel, carp, chub), and birds (wild duck, white stork, swan). However, it was also known for malarial mosquitoes and flooding. The lake was recorded in the old topographic maps, the oldest from 1525 and 1563. In 1679 by Valvasor engravings as Zhepizer See, later as Sisol lake, and Gessaro in 1753. The first documents about lake drainage dates to the end of 18th century by Austria and Venice. In 1898, during the rule of Austria, a project was developed to halve the lake surface to around 300 ha. In 1899 it was accepted by Istrian parliament, and the work began in 1902, but was stopped in 1908 due to lack of financial support. When Istria came under the rule of Italy in 1918, a consortium was established in 1920 for regulating the course of the Ra≈°a River, Conzorzio di Bonifica del Sistema dell' Arsa, and the work on the new project began in 1928. The tunnel, which extended from the southern point of the lake to the Gulf of Plomin, was 4,560 metres long, built by between 96 and 262 workers per year, and was finished after four years in October 1932. The dam was opened on 11 December of the same year, and the water reached the gulf in 26 minutes. By January 1933, the lake water, totaling 20 million cubic metres, had drained almost completely.

The literal English translation of the name is \\"time to search for\\". The Pilolo game is played by two or more children. The higher the number, the increase in excitement and zeal to win. An object like a stick is mostly used and the number of sticks to use is dependent on the number of children. A non- participant hides the sticks while the participants have either closed their eyes or not in the same location. The non-participant then shout out \\"pi-lo- lo\\", the participants then run from their hideout to search for the item. A finish point is indicated where they must send the stick to be a winner. One needs to be smart, observant and skillful to detect where the item has been hidden. The first person that sees it secretly runs to the finish point before alerting the others after a hard time trying. It is then recorded as they reach the finish point. Rules The game is played among ten or more children. When ten children have decided to play, one kid is chosen to be the leader of the game. The leader searches for small pieces of sticks. The game starts when the leader tells the other kids to hide. The leader either ensures that they are facing a wall or asks somebody to watch them so that they do not peek. The leader may hide the sticks under stones, on top of short trees, in grass, or even leave one on the ground just in front of the kids who are waiting. The sticks are generally hidden in a place which is convenient but not easy to find. When the sticks are hidden, the leader shouts \\"pilolo\\", and the kids run to search for the hiding sticks. As they search for the sticks they sing a song. One popular song which is sung is \\"pilolo yafo be mli\\", a Ghanaian song that literally means \\"pilolo nobody is expected to cry\\". A kid who finds a small piece of stick first may pretend to have not seen it, or may pick it up fast when the others are not watching and run to touch the leader. The others would have to do the same. The child who finds the stick is then given a point.

The species is widely distributed in Europe, from Sweden in the north to Anatolia in the south. In England this species is almost always found nesting in oak trees or rotting wood mainly foraging in trees but has also been found under stones and foraging on the ground. It is thought to be underrecorded but is fairly common especially in the South East. Workers are easy to identify as they are bicoloured, but they can be confused with Lasius emarginatus. Nuptial flights have been recorded as early as May on warm days from early morning to early afternoon.

Evantra is produced on commission, in a maximum of five units per year. Context In 2011 Luca Mazzanti, after a three years work, supported from the designer Zsolt Tarnok, presented the project \\"Evantra\\", a mid-engine coup√© designed to be produced in a very limited number and highly customizable. During 2012 Mazzanti realized models in scale 1:1 and began the construction of the very first unit. The final test of Evantra happened in circuit at Autodromo di Modena. and in 2013 Mazzanti Evantra was presented in a World premiere during the Top Marques Monaco Show also getting international exposure through the press at the show, so much that the company was contacted by many of the largest international car magazines. In 2014, Sony Entertainment shown his interest in the car by asking the permission to get the commercial rights of Evantra for Driveclub, a very popular driving simulation video game. The name Evantra, as tradition of Mazzanti Automobili, derives from the Etruscan language and it combines the concepts of unity and eternity: Evantra in fact was the name by which the Etruscans called the goddess of immortality. Project The car is set up as a two-seater coup√©, result of research carried out by Luca Mazzanti, patron of Mazzanti Automobili, assisted by Zsolt Tarnok (Mazzanti Automobili chief designer). It is also known as the Evantra 771. =Chassis= The boxed steel chassis is joined to a cage of chrome-molybdenum tubes creating the framework inside the vehicle. Another cage connects the engine/gearbox compartment to rear shocks attacks. These solutions contribute significantly to the structural rigidity of the chassis and at the same time guarantee the safety of the occupants. =Bodywork= The body is structurally a two-seater coup√©. The same body is built in two different types of equipment: pro-body, made in carbon fiber, or one-body, with some parts in hand-wrought aluminum and customizable, obtaining in this case a project dedicated exclusively to a single vehicle, in practice a one-off. =Interiors= Interiors, made to measure each time, are aimed at a total customization. The sporty central console, has an instrument panel equipped with a multimedia system and data acquisition trim. The engine start button is placed on the integrated bridge to the pavilion in the Mazzanti style, already used on Antas, the previous car of this company. In the central console there is a specific selector with 2 different programs for the management of the engine/transmission, \\"Road\\" and \\"Race\\", while the AIM steering wheel has a display with gear and speed indicator. =Engine= The engine is a naturally aspirated, 7.0-liter aluminum Chevrolet LS7 V8 engine that produces at 6600 rpm and a maximum torque of at 4500 rpm. The engine has a compression ratio of 11: 1 and is equipped with dry-sump lubrication system, titanium valves and connecting rods. =Features and performances= The Evantra V8 is equipped with a 6-speed automatic gearbox, can reach a top speed exceeding and can accelerate from 0‚Äì100 km/h (62 mph) in about 3.2 seconds. The aerodynamic development was realized with the support of partners with significant background in F1 and Le Mans. The car is equipped with stock high performance tires 255/30 R20 front and 325/25 R20 rear, mounted on specific 20\\" OZ Racing wheels, and controlled by a Brembo braking system with carbon-ceramic 380 mm discs and 6-piston calipers at the front and 360 mm discs and 4-piston calipers at the rear.

Lady Lilias lived at Castle Grant, then called Freuchie castle, or at Ballachastell, near Inverness. From the evidence of the Grant muniments, she seems to have been a lady of much vigour of character. She took an active interest in the affairs of the Grant family, and was greatly respected by her family and neighbours. Taylor the Water-Poet visited Lady Lilias and her husband at Ballachastell in 1618 and was much pleased with her, and he records that she was, both inwardly and outwardly, plentifully endowed with the gifts of grace and nature.John Taylor, 'Pennilesse Pilgrimage', All the Workes of John Taylor, the Water Poet (London, 1630), p. 137. He makes no mention of any poetical works. Lady Lilias was a reader, and had, for these days, a good if not very varied collection of books, is proved by two lists of her own library given under her own hand.William Fraser, The Chiefs of Grant, Correspondence vol.2 (Edinburgh, 1883), p. 54: Sebastiaan Verweij,The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland (Oxford, 2016), pp. 214-7. In one list, St. Augustine, and the \\"Imitation of Christ\\" occupy a place. Two poems survive in the Grant papers, and are attributed to Lilias Murray, although whether original or copies in her own hand is not clear. The two poems, a lyric about a maid overheard complaining of the pangs of love, and a complaint against Cupid mentioning a mumchance, a masque or guising, are known in other manuscripts.Sebastiaan Verweij,The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland (Oxford, 2016), p. 217. She survived her husband for twenty-one years, dying in the end of 1643 or the beginning of the following year. Her testament and latter will is dated on 30 December 1643.

He also wrote several songs for Universal Pictures' films, including Mister Big (1943). In 1959, he wrote the title song for the Oscar-winning film Pillow Talk, which actress Doris Day sang during the opening credits. In addition to his contributions in the film industry, Pepper was also known as the piano accompanist, arranger, and even vocal coach of such stars as Judy Garland, Margaret Whiting, Marlene Dietrich, Smilin' Jack Smith, and Lisa Kirk. Early life Buddy Pepper was born Jack Retherford Starkey in La Grange, Kentucky on April 21, 1922. He took up piano without taking any lessons when he was only five years old, learning songs by ear alone, including the difficult ragtime tune \\"Twelfth Street Rag.\\" He showcased his musical gifts around the age of seven, playing piano and singing on stages throughout his hometown. In 1930, he had his own \\"song and piano program,\\" airing every week on local Louisville radio station WHAS. At age eleven, he performed as the star piano soloist in the Steedman Philharmonic Club at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, playing Mozart's D Major Piano Concerto. Starkey and another local child performer, Florence Krauss, often appeared together at different events throughout the city, even performing at the B. F. Keith owned Rialto Theatre in Louisville. The two soon earned a letter of introduction from a Louisville dramatic critic and went to audition at RKO Pictures in Hollywood. When rejected by the studio, they created their own vaudeville act with Jack Pepper and titled the show \\"Buddy and Florence Pepper.\\" It was at this time that Starkey first went under his stage name \\"Buddy Pepper.\\" After their act ended, Starkey and Krauss appeared on Major Bowes Amateur Hour in New York in July 1936, where Mr. Bowes liked them so much that he offered them a job with a local Manhattan band, though child labor laws prevented them from accepting. After their appearance on Amateur Hour, the two returned to California at the request of Jack Pepper and again performed their vaudeville act, until both were eventually discovered by Universal Pictures. Buddy Pepper, as he chose to be referred throughout his Hollywood career, gained his first acting role in the 1938 film That Certain Age, starring Deanna Durbin and Jackie Cooper. Acting Once established in California, Pepper began attending Ma Lawlor's Professional School, located off Hollywood Boulevard, where he met and became friends with actress Judy Garland. While going to school, he continued to further his career on screen alongside other child stars in Hollywood. His first big role was in the Paramount Pictures film Seventeen (1940), starring Jackie Cooper. A year later, he gained a starring role in Disney's film The Reluctant Dragon (1941), playing Humphrey the studio guide alongside Robert Benchley. Shortly after the hit Broadway musical revue Meet the People opened on December 25, 1939, Pepper joined the cast on its nearly two-year run throughout the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco, among others. During his tour with the show, Starkey met actress Jane Withers following a performance which she attended. Pepper was then cast in the Twentieth Century Fox films Golden Hoofs (1941) and Small Town Deb (1941), both starring Withers herself. His final movie role was in the 1942 film Reap the Wild Wind in an uncredited role. In 1956, he appeared in an episode of the TV series Front Row Center.  Military career  From 1942 to 1945, Pepper served in the military. He was first stationed at Fort MacArthur in California, during which time he and other servicemen performed in an \\"all-soldier\\" revue titled Hey, Rookie. After the revue's conclusion, he went on a 12,000 mile tour that included stops to entertain soldiers serving as bases in Alaska, northern Canada, and the Arctic Circle. He then started another tour throughout the Air Transport Command Ferrying Division bases after he was selected as one of \\"the three top entertainers\\" in the ATC. During his time at the New Castle Army Air Base in Wilmington, Delaware, Pepper was the announcer of a radio show titled the \\"All Sports Show,\\" which hosted his former co-star Jane Withers, among other popular names, in order to attract attention and raise funds for the creation of a service club at the air base. Pepper was discharged in October 1945 and returned to his career in Hollywood. Music = Early Years (1939-1951) = Through his association on screen with Jackie Cooper, Pepper joined Cooper's swing band, named the Clam-Bake Cats, in 1939, with himself providing piano accompaniment and vocals, Cooper playing the drums, and Leonard Sues playing the trumpet. He began writing and composing his own songs soon after arriving in Hollywood. In 1942, composer Duke Ellington performed Pepper's song \\"What Good Would It Do?\\", featuring Herb Jeffries on vocals. Pepper frequently collaborated with fellow songwriter and composer Inez James, many of their songs appearing in the Universal Pictures' films When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1942), All By Myself (1943), Top Man (1943), You're A Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith (1943), This is The Life (1944), and Senorita from the West (1945). In 1943, Pepper and James composed the musical score for the film Mister Big, in which Donald O'Connor starred. Following his service in the military during World War II, Pepper wrote the song \\"Don't Tell Me\\" for Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer's 1947 film The Hucksters, starring Clark Gable. Ava Gardner performed the song in the film, though Eileen Wilson provided the vocals for her. In 1947, Margaret Whiting recorded the song as well. Another song by Pepper and James was released the same year, titled \\"Now You've Gone and Hurt My Southern Pride\\" and recorded by Phil Harris with his orchestra. In 1949, Pepper, along with composer Earl Brent, wrote the musical revue titled Tongue in Cheek, which ran for two months at the Las Palmas Theater in Los Angeles. A few years later, in 1954, Pepper composed and wrote a few songs with James for another musical revue titled That's Life, which ran for 18 weeks at the same theater before opening in San Francisco and Oakland in the fall. In 1950, Frank Sinatra sang Pepper and Richard A. Whiting's song \\"Sorry\\" as did Eddie Fisher, Margaret Whiting, and Bing Crosby. = Europe Tour with Judy Garland (April‚ÄìSeptember 1951) = In March 1951, Pepper agreed to accompany Judy Garland on a six-month tour throughout Europe in her first return to the stage since her film career had begun 14 years earlier. The tour began in London, England, at the Palladium on April 9 in front of a crowd of approximately 2,500 people. Pepper later recalled that the success of Garland's performance that night was viewed by local media in London as being \\"the greatest ovation ever given an American artist.\\" However, towards the end of opening night, as Garland began to exit the stage, she suddenly tripped and fell. Pepper rushed from the piano to lift her to her feet, and both laughed it off, Garland even calling it \\"one of the most ungraceful exits\\" there ever was. A couple of weeks later, a picture of Pepper helping Garland up after her fall was printed in the April 23rd edition of LIFE Magazine. Throughout the rest of the tour, he and Garland appeared in England, Ireland, and Scotland, performing at the Palladium and the Palace Theatre in Manchester, as well as in the cities of Glasgow, Dublin, Edinburgh, and Birmingham. During an earlier appearance in the tour, Garland, before singing the song \\"Just One Of Those Things,\\" introduced Pepper to the audience, saying, \\"Before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to a young man without whom I'd be completely lost, my love, Buddy Pepper.\\" = Later Years (1951-1960) = Upon his return from Europe, Pepper began his accompaniment to Lisa Kirk, as well as to Smilin' Jack Smith. During his partnership with Kirk, which lasted for several years, he appeared at the Persian Room of the Plaza Hotel, at the hotel and casino El Rancho Vegas off the Las Vegas Strip, and at the Palmer House in Chicago, as well as other popular nightspots throughout the country. With Smith, he toured the cities of New York, Detroit, Toronto, Washington, Denver, Buffalo, San Diego, Winnipeg, and Vancouver, playing in such spots as the Statler Hotel in Detroit, Michigan. In January 1952, Warner Bros. purchased Pepper and James' song \\"Ole St. Nicholas,\\" originally recorded by Doris Day in 1949. It was sung by Day in the movie The Winning Team (1952), in which she starred alongside Ronald Reagan. In December 1952, Anita O'Day produced one of the first recordings of the song that came to define Pepper's career, \\"Vaya Con Dios.\\" He was one of the three writers of the song, the other two being his longtime collaborator, Inez James, and film composer Larry Russell. In June 1953, Capitol Records released the Les Paul and Mary Ford recording of \\"Vaya Con Dios,\\" which almost instantly popularized the song, as it was listed on Billboard magazine's best seller chart by June 13. It remained became #1 hit in August, after which it appeared in the number one spot for 11 weeks, all non-consecutive. By August 4, Paul and Ford's record had sold more than 400,000 copies in three weeks. In November 1953, it ranked at #2 on Variety's popularity list and at #9 among the most popular songs in England. While \\"Vaya Con Dios\\" became the top ranked tune of 1953, \\"The Song From Moulin Rouge\\" placed first among best-selling records and those most played on the radio, and therefore is often named as the number one song of 1953. \\"Vaya\\" has been recorded more than 500 times by many artists, including acclaimed singers Gene Autry, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, and Mel Torm√©, among others. In 1954, Marge and Gower Champion debuted a ballroom dance called the Champion Strut, and the music that accompanied it was composed by Pepper, while the lyrics were written by Robert Wells, who co-wrote the popular \\"The Christmas Song.\\" Pepper began to accompany Marlene Dietrich in 1955, playing for her at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas for a few weeks. In 1959, Pepper and James wrote the title song for the film Pillow Talk, which starred Rock Hudson and Doris Day, who sang the title song. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards in 1960, one of which was for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. It ultimately won the award for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay. In 1960, Pepper and James composed the musical theme for the Universal Pictures film Portrait in Black, starring Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn. In later years, Pepper developed acute arthritis in his hands and was unable to play the piano, though his career had already seemed to have reached a decline years earlier in 1970.  Awards and Honors  In 1976, Ralph Edwards from the radio and television game show Truth or Consequences created the \\"Buddy Pepper Musical Achievement Award,\\" which was presented annually to musically gifted students of Hot Springs High School in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, beginning in 1976. In 2005, Les Paul and Mary Ford's rendition of \\"Vaya Con Dios\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Death  Buddy Pepper died of heart failure on February 7, 1993 at his home in Sherman Oaks, California at the age of 70. His survivors included two cousins.

She was a well-bred mare, being descended from a half- sister of the outstanding Irish racehorse Ragusa. As a two-year-old in 1975 she showed promise when winning her only race of the season. In the following year she was rated the best three-year-old filly trained in the British Isles in a division which was otherwise dominated by French-trained horses. She recorded Group One wins in the Irish 1,000 Guineas and Yorkshire Oaks, as well as finishing second to Lagunette in both the Irish Oaks and the Prix Vermeille. She failed to win as a four-year-old, but became a very successful broodmare. Background Sarah Siddons was a \\"strong, lengthy, attractive\\" bay mare with a white star bred in France by her owner, Meg Mullion's Ardenode Stud. Her sire was the Seamus McGrath-owned Le Levanstell, who won the Sussex Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1961 before a successful stud career with his best offspring including Levmoss and Le Moss. Le Levanstell was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Sarah Siddons was the first of only three foals produced by Mariel, a high-class mare who won the Pretty Polly Stakes, and was placed in the Irish 1000 Guineas, Epsom Oaks and Irish Oaks. Mariel's dam Ela Marita won the Fred Darling Stakes and the Musidora Stakes and was a half-sister to Ragusa. The filly, named after the great actress Sarah Siddons, was sent into training with the veteran Paddy Prendergast at his stables near the Curragh in Ireland. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut she started favourite in a seven furlong event for previously unraced horses at Phoenix Park Racecourse in October. She won by one and a half lengths from Conduct Unbecoming with a large gap back to the other fourteen runners. =1976: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Sarah Siddons finished second in the seven-furlong Athasi Stakes at the Curragh in April, beaten three quarters of a length by Serenica. On 14 May, the filly was moved up in class for the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the same course. Ridden as in most of her early races by Christy Roche, she started the 9/2 third choice in a fourteen-runner field with the British-trained Sunbird starting 11/4 favourite ahead of Serenica on 4/1. A quarter of a mile from the finish she appeared to be struggling but stayed on under pressure and as the field entered the final furlong she was disputing the lead alongside Clover Princess, Krassata and Lady Singer. Sarah Siddons took the advantage in the closing stages and won by a length from Clover Princess with Lady Singer a length further back in third. For her next race, Sarah Siddons was sent to France to contest the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 13 June. Starting a 50/1 outsider in a very strong field she finished well to take fifth place behind Pawneese, Riverqueen, Lagunette and Antrona with Theia in sixth. Sarah Siddons returned to Ireland for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 17 July and started 4/1 third favourite behind Acoma (a six-length winner of her only previous start) and Lagunette. She finished second of the eighteen runners, two lengths behind Lagunette and half a length in front of the Vincent O'Brien trained I've A Bee. On her first appearance in England, Sarah Siddons started 100/30 second favourite behind her fellow Irish challenger I've A Bee in a field of thirteen for the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse in August. The other runners included Centrocon (Lancashire Oaks), African Dancer (Cheshire Oaks) and Roses for the Star (runner-up to Pawneese in The Oaks). She was towards the rear of the field entering the straight but was then switched to the outside and began to make steady progress. She was still only fifth a furlong out but continued her run to take the lead in the final strides and won by a head from African Dancer with Roses for the star in third. Although the filly had run well on good and firm ground Prendergast had insisted that the Sarah Siddons would be better suited by a soft surface, which she encountered for the first time in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse on 19 September. With Lester Piggott taking over the ride from Roche, she started a 24/1 outsider in a field which included Pawneese, Riverqueen, Lagunette and Theia. She produced a strong late run to take the lead from Lagunette inside the last 200 metres and looked the likely winner, but Lagunette rallied to defeat the Irish filly by a nose. Timeform described Sarah Siddons' performance as \\"the race of her life\\". =1977: four-year-old season= Sarah Siddons remained in training as a four- year-old but failed to win in five races. After finishing third over seven furlongs on her debut in the Gladness Stakes at the Curragh, she finished last of the twelve runners behind Arctic Tern in the Prix Ganay at Longchamp on 1 May. At York in August she produced her best performance of the year when finishing fourth behind Relkino, Artaius and Orange Bay in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. In October she was equipped with blinkers for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 2 October. Ridden by Joe Mercer, she started a 59/1 outsider and finished last of the twenty-six runners behind Alleged. Assessment and awards In 1975, the independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 102 p (the p indicating that she was likely to make significantly more than usual improvement), twenty-six pounds behind their top-rated juvenile filly Theia. In 1976, Timeform awarded her a rating of 122, making her nine pounds inferior to Pawneese, but described her as \\"undoubtedly the best three-year-old filly trained in either England or Ireland\\". Despite failing to win in 1977, Sarah Siddons was rated the best older female racehorse in Ireland. Timeform gave her a rating of 115. Breeding record Sarah Siddons was a prolific and successful broodmare, producing fifteen foals (including at least eight winners) in sixteen years between 1979 and 1994. She died in 2000. Her foals included: *Gertrude Lawrence, a bay filly, foaled in 1979, sired by Ballymore. Unraced.

Eaton, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 356 (1822), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held, chiefly, that a patent on an improved machine must clearly describe how the machine differs from the prior art. It was the fourth published Supreme Court decision on patents,Malla Pollack, The Owned Public Domain: The Constitutional Right Not to Be Excluded - or the Supreme Court Chose the Right Breakfast Cereal in Kellogg v. National Biscuit Co., 22 Hastings Comm. & Ent L.J. 265, 291 n119 (2000). and the second to deal with substantive patent law.Harold C. Wegner, Post-Merck Experimental Use and the \\"Safe Harbor\\", 15 Fed. Circuit B.J. 1, 37 (2005). It was also the third of four successive Supreme Court cases related specifically to the Oliver Evans flour mill patent. Background Evans' hopperboy and automated bolting process. In the 1780s, inventor Oliver Evans developed a system for an automated flour mill that would revolutionize milling technology. After keeping his invention a secret while he reduced it to practice, he initially obtained protection for it through individual state statutes, for example in Maryland and New Hampshire, because the patent system did not yet exist. When the Patent Act of 1790 took effect, Evans obtained the third United States patent ever issued. No copies of this original patent are extant. As all patents at the time had 14-year terms, his patent lapsed in 1804, and the invention entered the public domain. Immediately upon the expiration of his patent, he sought a private bill that would allow him to renew it, the first such request ever made. He was unsuccessful until 1808, when the Tenth Congress passed a law authorizing the Secretary of State to grant him a new patent on the same terms as the original one.\\"An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans\\", 6 Stat. 70. Evans obtained his new patent the day after the law took effect.Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 872 (C.C.D. Va. 1813). Under the Patent Act of 1793, which was in effect at the time of the 1808 grant, patents were not required to have claims. In the case of complex patent such as Evans', which included both a general improved method of manufacturing flour and specific improved machines for achieving that method, this created confusion as to the actual scope of grant. By the same token, it also created confusion as to the kind of prior art that would suffice to invalidate the patent on the basis of anticipation. In the district court for Pennsylvania, the defendant Eaton did not dispute having used Evans' improved hopperboy, but sought to show either that the patent only covered the improved method as a whole (and not the hopperboy specifically), or alternatively that the patent had been anticipated by earlier machines. In particular, the defendant introduced evidence of a crude kind of hopperboy that was in use at some mills in Pennsylvania in the 1760s. Persuaded that the patent could only cover the improved method as a whole, rather than any of the improved machines, the court instructed the jury in such a way that the jurors had no choice but to return a verdict for the defendant, as they did. The court also declined to admit the plaintiff's proffered evidence that the defendant had initially offered to pay a license fee to Evans. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court on a writ of error, and then remanded to the district court after a determination that the patent was not valid unless it was distinct from the prior art. On retrial, the district court found that the patent was invalid, on two grounds: (1) that if the patent was on the hopperboy as such, it was anticipated because there had been other hopperboys in use before Evans' invention; and (2) that if the patent was on Evans' improvements to the hopperboy, it was invalid for lack of written description, because the patent did not clearly set forth the ways in which Evans' hopperboy differed from hopperboys of the prior art. Evans then appealed once again to the Supreme Court. Two of Evans' objections were procedural: that evidence was admitted from the testimony of a miller who stood to benefit from the patent being declared invalid, and that the trial court had unjustly excluded a deposition taken according to established state procedure rather than federal procedure.20 U.S. at 424-426. The others were more substantive: that the trial court erred in telling the jury that if the patent was on the hopperboy as such, it would be invalidated by any use of a hopperboy operating on the same principle as Evans' hopperboy; and that the trial court erred in ruling that if the patent was only on the improvements to the hopperboy, the patent was invalid for failing to describe precisely what the improvements were. Evans died two years before the Supreme Court ruled on this second appeal; his factory had been destroyed by fire in 1819. Opinion of the Court Writing for the four-justice majority, Justice Story rejected each of Evans' appeals: # The trial court's admission of the miller's testimony was acceptable, because the miller did not have a direct interest in the outcome of the specific case, and excluding everyone who had even a general interest in the subject matter of a patent case would effectively exclude everyone in the industry.20 U.S. at 425-426. # The trial court's exclusion of the deposition was proper because no amount of established local practice could overturn federal procedural rules.20 U.S. at 426. # The trial court properly left the question of whether the Evans hopperboy was anticipated by the prior art to the jury.20 U.S. at 431-432 # The trial court properly ruled that if the Evans patent was only on the improvement to the hopperboy, it was void as a matter of law because the patent did not set forth how the invention differed from the hopperboys of the prior art. Dissent Three justices dissented: Johnson, Livingston, and Duvall.20 U.S. at 452. The recorded dissenting opinion was however authored by Justice Livingston alone. Livingston took particular issue with the Supreme Court's willingness to accept English precedents on patent law despite the growing differences between the British and American patent systems. Skipping over Evans' procedural objections,20 U.S. at 452. Justice Livingston dissented on three points:20 U.S. at 438. # He contended that the specification of the Evans patent was not defective in the first place, because it provided sufficient information to \\"distinguish [the invention] from all other things before known\\", as required by the Patent Act of 1793, section 11.20 U.S. at 439 Even though the specification did not elaborate on the distinctions between the invention and the prior art, any person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to see how it differed from previous hopperboys, and would be on notice of what kind of hopperboy would infringe the patent. # He contended that a patent should not be entirely invalidated merely because its claims are overbroad.20 U.S. at 446. Although there were English precedents for such an action, the American law did not require it, and there was no basis for imposing such a \\"very high penalty\\" when the patent had been filed in good faith without any intention to over- claim. # Even if such a penalty was proper, Livingston argued, it was based on a question of fact and should be assessed only by a jury.20 U.S. at 449. Subsequent developments The case was the culmination of a long series of previous decisions holding that an invention had not only to set forth how to implement the invention, but also how the invention differed from the prior art. This doctrine ultimately gave rise to the requirement for separate, distinct claims, as adopted in the Patent Act of 1836. It also gave rise to the written description requirement as distinct from the enablement requirement.Robert A. Matthews, Jr. (2015), 3 Annotated Patent Digest ¬ß 22:8. However, in modern jurisprudence the written description requirement did not re-emerge as a distinct issue until the passage of the Patent Act of 1952.Shraddha A. Upadhyaya, The Postmodern Written Description Requirement: An Analysis of the Application of the Heightened Written Description Requirement to Original Claims, 4 Minn. Intell. Prop. Rev. 65, 71-72 (2002). It first entered modern jurisprudence as a distinct requirement when the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals issued its In re Ruschig decision in 1965.Stephen M. Maurer, Ideas into Practice: How Well Does U.S. Patent Law Implement Modern Innovation Theory?, 12 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 644, 690 (2013). This historical connection notwithstanding, authorities including Judge Rader have argued that Evans v. Eaton in fact supports considering enablement and written description as a single requirement, because the need for distinction from the prior art was addressed by the requirement for a separate claims section.Michael A. Greene, Gilding the Lilly: The S 112 Written Description Requirement Separate from Enablement, 52 B.C.L. Rev. E-Supplement 213, 220-21 (2011). The case has also been noted as an early antecedent to the modern doctrine of obviousness,A New Way to Determine Obviousness: Applying the Pioneer Doctrine to 35 U.S.C. 103 (a), 29 AIPLA Q.J. 375, 429 (2001). and the doctrine of equivalents.Robert N. Young, Judge Versus Jury on the Scales of Justice: 35 U.S.C. S 112, P 6 \\"Equivalents\\" in the Balance, 32 J. Marshall L. Rev. 833, 848 (1999).Prosecution History Estoppel: The Choice Between Public Interests and Inventor's Property Rights, 36 Val. U. L. Rev. 239, 245-46 (2001). Because the case is specific to the state of patent law before 1836, it has seldom been cited since the mid-19th century. The most recent citation in a Supreme Court case is in the 1906 case of Burton v. United States, in which the case was cited as authority for the admissibility of testimony from witnesses with a general interest in the outcome of a case.202 U.S. 344, 393-94, 26 S. Ct. 688, 704, 50 L. Ed. 1057 (1906). Before that, it was cited in Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Raddin in 1887, as an early example of the court's objections to including unnecessarily lengthy quotations in the text of an appeal.120 U.S. 183, 193, 7 S. Ct. 500, 504, 30 L. Ed. 644 (1887). It was also sometimes cited in cases over land patents, regarding the necessity for any grant to be clearly distinguished from other grants, for example in the 1837 case of Proprietors of Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of Warren Bridge.36 U.S. 420, 650, 9 L. Ed. 773.

Founded by AT&T;, Cisco, General Electric, IBM, and Intel in March 2014, the IIC catalyzes and coordinates the priorities and enabling technologies of the Industrial Internet. Its current executive director is Richard Soley. Stephen J. Mellor serves as Chief Technical Officer for the Industrial Internet Consortium.  History  The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) was founded on 27 March 2014 by AT&T;, Cisco, General Electric, IBM, and Intel. Though its parent company is the Object Management Group, the IIC is not a standards organization.Essex, David. \\"Industrial Internet Consortium tackles interoperability\\" TechTarget. 12 Sept 2014. Rather, the consortium was formed to bring together industry players ‚Äî from multinational corporations, small and large technology innovators to academia and governments ‚Äî to accelerate the development, adoption and widespread use of Industrial Internet technologies.Hardy, Quentin. \\"Consortium Wants Standards for Internet of Things\\". New York Times. 27 March 2014. The mission has changed over the years from a focus on growing an industrial internet market to one more focussed on connectivity and trustworthiness to one focused on digital transformation and deployments. The mission, from August 2020, is \\"To deliver transformative business value to organizations, industry and society by accelerating adoption of a trustworthy internet of things\\". Specifically, the IIC members are concerned with creating an ecosystem for insight and thought leadership, interoperability and security via reference architectures, security frameworks and open standards, and real world implementations to vet technologies and drive innovations (called testbeds). The IIC Technology Working Group ratified an Industrial Internet reference architecture on 17 June 2015, which defines functional areas and the technologies and standards for them, from sensors to data analytics and business applications.Pike, Julie. \\"Industrial Internet Consortium Releases Reference Architecture\\" Industrial Internet Consortium. 17 June 2015.  Testbeds  The development of testbeds to demonstrate the real- world implementation of Industrial Internet solutions is one of the goals of the IIC. As of February 2016, the Consortium has publicly announced nine testbeds: = Track and Trace = The Track and Trace testbed brings the Industrial Internet onto the factory floor. The goal is to manage handheld power tools in manufacturing and maintenance environments. This \\"management\\" involves efficiently tracking and tracing the usage of these tools to ensure their proper use, prevent their misuse and collect data on their usage and status. Today's factories are highly sophisticated and require exacting work - down to the precise amount of force used to tighten a screw. The tools in Track and Trace will be able to determine its precise location and use and, therefore, will be able to determine the force and work needed to complete a task. In addition, if a tool recognizes that it is being misused, it will promptly power down to avoid accident or injury. Finally, over the two-year project, the testbed participants will look to fine-tune the localization of tools to 30 centimeters, and ideally down to five centimeters. Currently, the accuracy is approximately one meter. These features of Track and Trace will contribute to the safety and quality of the goods produced, as well as increase productivity in manufacturing. Over the two-year project, four Industrial Internet Consortium members will be lending their expertise to the testbed. Bosch is supplying the necessary software; Cisco is taking care of the precision location identification feature; National Instruments will interconnect the power tools; and Tech Mahindra is responsible for the application programming.Las Marias, Stephen. \\"Track and Track Project Brings Industry Closer to 'Smarter Manufacturing' Vision\\" Control Engineering. 16 Feb 2015. = Communication & Control Testbed For Microgrid Applications = The Communication & Control Testbed for Microgrid Applications brings the Industrial Internet to the energy industry. The testbed proposes redesigning the traditional power grid system into a series of microgrids. Microgrids rely on distributed energy generation making them more resilient to power outages. Additionally, microgrids aid in the integration of green energy sources, such as solar and wind. The goal of the testbed is to prove the viability of a real-time, secure databus to facilitate machine-to-machine, machine-to-control center, and machine-to-cloud data communications. It will combine distributed, edge-located processing and control applications with intelligent analytics. It will run in real-world power applications and interface with practical equipment. This testbed is a collaborative effort from IIC members Real-Time Innovations, National Instruments, and Cisco. There will also be collaboration with Duke Energy and the Standard Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) to ensure a coordinated, accepted architecture.O'Connor, Mary Catherine. \\"Industrial Internet Consortium Announces Microgrid Testbed\\" Internet of Things Journal. 27 March 2014. = Asset Efficiency Testbed = Many industries have assets that are critical to their business processes. Availability and efficiency of these assets directly impact service and business. Using predictive analytics, the Asset Efficiency Testbed aims to collect real-time asset information efficiently and accurately and run analytics to make the right decisions in terms of operations, maintenance, overhaul and asset replacement. Infosys, a member of the Industrial Internet Consortium, is leading this project, with contribution from Consortium members Bosch, General Electric, IBM, Intel, National Instruments, and PTC. Asset Efficiency is a vertical testbed, making it possible for the testbed to be applied to multiple solutions. The testbed will launch in two phases. In the first phase, the testbed will be created for a moving solution, in this case, aircraft landing gear. The focus of this phase will be on the creation of stack and the integration of technologies. In the second phase, the testbed will address fixed assets, like chillers, with the goals of finalizing the architecture and opening up the interfaces. The Asset Efficiency Testbed monitors, controls and optimizes the assets holistically taking into consideration operational, energy, maintenance, service, and information efficiency and enhance their performance utilization.\\"Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) approves Infosys Asset Efficiency Testbed Infosys. August 2015. = Edge Intelligence Testbed = Many emerging industrial IoT applications require coordinated, real-time analytics at the \\"edge\\", using algorithms that require a scale of computation and data volume/velocity previously seen only in the data center. Frequently, the networks connecting these machines do not provide sufficient capability, bandwidth, reliability, or cost structure to enable analytics-based control or coordination algorithms to run in a separate location from the machines. Industrial Internet Consortium members Hewlett-Packard and Real-Time Innovation have joined together on the Edge Intelligence Testbed. The primary objective of the Edge Intelligence Testbed is to significantly accelerate the development of edge architectures and algorithms by removing the barriers that many developers face: access to a wide variety of advanced compute hardware and software configurable to directly resemble state-of-the-art edge systems at very low cost to the tester/developer.Pike, Julie. \\"Edge Intelligence Testbed\\" Industrial Internet Consoritum. 2015. = Factory Operations Visibility & Intelligence Testbed = The Factory Operations Visibility & Intelligence (FOVI) Testbed makes it possible to simulate a factory environment in order to visualize results that can then be used to determine how the process can be optimized. The work on FOVI stems from two separate Operations Visibility and Intelligence applications in two factories in Japan: one for notebook computers and another for network appliances. Both use cases have a lot in common with respect to processing data, analytics, and visualization technologies. Ideally they should use a common software foundation while their future evolution requires a more open architecture. Work on the testbed will be led by Industrial Internet Consortium member Fujitsu Limited with Industrial Internet Consortium founding member, Cisco, collaborating on the in-factory testbed edge infrastructure.\\"Fujitsu Gains Approval from Industrial Internet Consortium for its IoT Testbed Solution Model\\" Fujitsu Limited. 15 September 2015. = High Speed Network Infrastructure Testbed = The High-Speed Network Infrastructure testbed will introduce high-speed fiber optic lines to support Industrial Internet initiatives. The network will transfer data at 100 gigabits per second to support seamless machine-2-machines communications and data transfer across connected control systems, big infrastructure products, and manufacturing plants. The 100 gigabit capability extends to the wireless edge, allowing the testbed leaders to provide more data and analytical results to mobile users through advanced communication techniques. Industrial Internet Consortium founder, General Electric, is leading efforts by installing the networking lines at its Global Research Center. Cisco - also a founder of the Consortium - contributed its expertise to the project by providing the infrastructure needed to give the network its national reach. Industrial Internet Consortium members Accenture and Bayshore Networks are currently demonstrating the application of the High-Speed Network Infrastructure for power generation.Sarosiek, Amy. \\"GE Unveils High-Speed Network Infrastructure to Connect Machines, Data and People at Light Speed to the Industrial Internet\\" Business Wire. 16 July 2015. = Industrial Digital Thread Testbed = The Industrial Digital Thread (IDT) testbed drives efficiency, speed, and flexibility through digitization and automation of manufacturing processes and procedures. Beginning at design, the seamless digital integration of design systems into manufacturing, leveraging the model-based enterprise, helps to enable virtual manufacturing before even one physical part is created. Sensor enabled automation, manufacturing processes, procedures, and machine data will enable optimization in operations and supply chain. Once the manufacturing process is complete, the digital ‚Äòbirth certificate‚Äô (as built-signature) can then be compared to the as-designed engineering intention. This provides the opportunity for powerful big data analytics to enable service teams and field engineers to have better awareness, insights, and practical actions to improve the servicing and maintenance of critical assets. The Industrial Digital Thread is a complex and comprehensive concept and it will be implemented in multiple phases. Phase 1 focuses on assembling the software stack, establishing the architecture and connectivity, and addressing one use case around premature wear. Throughout Phase 1, the testbed will be run by IIC members General Electric and Infosys. In subsequent phases, this testbed will be able to support multiple use cases in design, manufacturing, services and supply-chain optimization. At this time, additional members will be invited to join.\\"Infosys Partners with GE to Develop New Solutions for the Industrial Internet of Things\\" Infosys. 2015. = INFINITE Testbed = The goal of the International Future Industrial Internet Testbed (INFINITE) is to develop software-defined infrastructures to drive the growth of Industrial Internet products and services. INFINITE uses Big Data to not only create completely virtual domains with Software-Defined Networking, but it also makes it possible for multiple virtual domains to securely run via one physical network - thus making it ideal for use in mission critical systems. Even more interesting, INFINITE makes it possible to connect to these virtual domains through mobile networks. Industrial Internet Consortium member, EMC Corporation, is leading the INFINITE testbed. Also contributing their expertise to this project is Industrial Internet Consortium member Cork Institute of Technology, as well as Vodafone, the Irish Government Networks, Asavie and Cork Internet Exchange. The testbed will unfold in two phases in Ireland. In Phase One, three geographically dispersed data centers will be interconnected into a reconfigured EMC network. In Phase Two, INFINITE will be applied to a use case called \\"Bluelight\\". Bluelight will allow ambulances to securely connect to a hospital's system and relay information while en route, so hospital staff are prepared to take over the care of the patient once the ambulance arrives. The INFINITE testbed is open to any Industrial Internet Consortium member as well as interested nonmembers companies who have a concept for an IoT-enabled solution that requires mobile communication and a dynamic configuration environment.Regan, Sarah. \\"EMC and Vodafone Ireland to launch Industrial ‚ÄòInternet of Things‚Äô innovation platform, ‚ÄúINFINITE‚Äù\\" Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. 16 June 2015. = Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance Testbed = The Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance Testbed (CM/PM) will demonstrate the value and benefits of continuously monitoring industrial equipment to detect early signs of performance degradation or failure. CM/PM will also use modern analytical technologies to allow organizations to not only detect problems but proactively recommend actions for operations and maintenance personnel to correct the problem. Condition Monitoring (CM) is the use of sensors in equipment to gather data and enable users to centrally monitor the data in real-time. Predictive Maintenance (PM) applies analytical models and rules against the data to proactively predict an impending issue; then deliver recommendations to operations, maintenance and IT departments to address the issue. These capabilities enable new ways to monitor the operation of the equipment - such as turbines and generators - and processes and to adopt proactive maintenance and repair procedures rather than fixed schedule-based procedures, potentially saving money on maintenance and repair, and saving cost and lost productivity of downtime caused by equipment failures. Furthermore, combining sensor data from multiple pieces of equipment and/or multiple processes can provide deeper insight into the overall impact of faulty or sub-optimal equipment, allowing organizations to identify and resolve problems before they impact operations and improve the quality and efficiency of industrial processes. Through this testbed, the testbed leaders IBM and National Instruments will explore the application of a variety of analytics technologies for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. The testbed application will initially be deployed to a power plant facility where performance and progress will be reported on, additional energy equipment will be added, and new models will be developed. It will then be expanded to adjacent, as yet to be determined, industries.Pike, Julie. \\"Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance Testbed\\" Industrial Internet Consortium. 2015. Smart Airline Baggage Management Testbed The Smart Airline Baggage Management testbed, part of a broader aviation ecosystem vision, is aimed at reducing the instances of delayed, damaged and lost bags leading to lower economic risk exposure to the airlines; increasing the ability to track and report on baggage including location and weight changes to prevent theft and loss; and improve customer satisfaction through better communication including offering new value-added services to frequent flyers. The testbed is also aimed at helping airlines address the new baggage handling requirements set out by IATA in Resolution 753 requiring airlines to implement more comprehensive acquisition and delivery solutions for baggage tracking and handling by June 2018. This target is also outlined in the broader IATA 2015 White Paper titled ‚ÄúSimplifying the Business.‚Äù  Working Groups  As of September 2020, the IIC has six working groups. They are: Technology, Security, Liaison, Marketing, Industry and Digital Transformation. The last two reflect the drive to enable technology end users to deploy technology in their businesses and transform them digitally. (The Industry Working Group used to be called the Testbed Working Group, but now includes test drives and challenges, and groups focused on specific verticals. The Digital Transformation Working Group used to be named Business Strategy and Solution Lifecycle, but has now broadened its remit.) Each working has a number of subgroups to further specific challenges. Each IIC member company can assign company representatives to these groups.

Biography Charles Hercules Boissevain was born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on Oct. 18, 1893, to Maria Barbera Pijnappel and Charles Ernest Henri Boissevain. His father was a businessman and politician who sat on the Amsterdam city council and was a member of parliament in the province of North Holland before and during World War I. His grandfather was Charles Boissevain, who had been the editor and part-owner of the Amsterdam Algemeen Handelsblad, a leading newspaper of its day. His mother was a Dutch advocate for women's rights who was a founder and president of the Dutch League for Women's Suffrage and (after the passage of suffrage in 1919) a member of parliament in the province of North Holland. Boissevain received his degree as a doctor of medecine from the University of Amsterdam. After graduation he spent two years doing postgraduate work in Switzerland and a further two years at the Pasteur Institute in Brussels, Belgium. As a young man in Holland, Boissevain had been a champion sculler and an ice skater (elfstedentocht 1917), but these activities were curtailed when he contracted tuberculosis. At the advice of his doctors, he moved to the United States in 1923 and made his way to the Colorado mountains in search of relief. (See Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs). In 1924, Boissevain married Marie Therese Vera Zvetana (or Tsvetana), Countess of Hartenau (b. 1893). She was the daughter of Alexander of Battenberg and Johanna Loisinger. The marriage was dissolved in 1927 without issue. In 1928, he married Ruth Davis (1892‚Äì1982), widow of the Chicago architect Henry C. Dangler (died 1917), who had been David Adler's partner. Her father was Dr. Nathan Smith Davis, Jr., dean of Northwestern University Medical College and son of Dr. Nathan Smith Davis, one of the founders of the American Medical Association. They lived in Colorado Springs until his death from cancer in October 1946. They had two children, a son, Menso, and a daughter, Maria. Research Boissevain was a mathematically trained biochemist who worked as a professor of biology at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. In 1924, he was appointed the first chief of research and laboratory director of the newly founded Colorado Foundation for Research in Tuberculosis, later renamed the Webb-Waring Institute. He had a reputation as a brilliant researcher and a man of many ideas. Boissevain had been interested in cacti for many years and eventually became a leading specialist in western cacti. He coauthored the first comprehensive survey of native Colorado cacti. It covers species in the genera Opuntia, Echinocereus, Sclerocactus, Coloradoa, Pediocactus, Coryphantha, and Neobesseya and includes numerous black-and-white photographs. One newly described species, Coloradoa mesa verdae, has since been reclassified as Sclerocactus mesae-verde. Boissevain's coauthor, Carol Davidson, took all of the photographs except two, one of which was by Laura Gilpin and the other by Elzada Clover. Abbreviation  * Standard IPNI Abbreviation: Boissev.

He made his MLB debut on April 22, 2018. Early life Torres was born and raised in Caracas by his parents, Eusebio Torres and Ibelise Castro. Intrigued by the name \\"Qleyber,\\" his father decided to name Torres after it because of its uniqueness. Torres grew up in a middle- class household. However, life at home devolved into unrest, with many citizens rebelling against the government in the wake of constant food shortages, rampant crime and widespread violence. Torres started playing baseball at the age of four as a center fielder, catcher, pitcher, and eventually shortstop. His passion for baseball grew watching games on TV, while idolizing his favorite player Omar Vizquel. Torres also played basketball briefly in high school, but he quit the sport on his father's instructions in order to focus on baseball. Academies began to take notice of Torres's talent and wanted to help him become a professional. At 14, Torres moved to Maracay to enroll in an academy that had contacts with MLB scouts. He was sought out by the Chicago Cubs and signed a contract with the team. When Torres was not playing baseball he would spend a lot of time with his friends, riding bicycles and going to amusement parks. One of his favorite games was \\"chapitas.\\" The game was played with a bottle cap, with one person pitching and another batting with a broomstick. Professional career =Chicago Cubs= Minor Leagues (2014‚Äì2018) Torres signed with the Chicago Cubs as an international free agent in 2013 for a $1.7 million signing bonus. He made his professional debut in 2014 with the Arizona Cubs of the Rookie-level Arizona League. He was later promoted to the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. In 50 games for the two teams combined, he hit .297/.386/.440 with two home runs. In 2015, Torres began the season with the South Bend Cubs of the Class A Midwest League, and was promoted to the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in September. In 487 at bats over 126 games for the two teams combined, he hit .287/.346/.376 with three home runs and 64 runs batted in (RBI). Torres started 2016 with Myrtle Beach. =New York Yankees= On July 25, the Cubs traded Torres, Adam Warren, Billy McKinney, and Rashad Crawford to the Yankees for relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman. He began his Yankees career playing with the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He finished the 2016 season batting .270/.354/.421 with 11 home runs and 66 RBI for the two Class A+ teams combined. After the season, the Yankees assigned him to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL). After batting .403 in 76 at bats with a .513 on-base percentage and a 1.158 OPS, Torres was named the AFL Most Valuable Player. At the age of 19, Torres was the youngest player in the AFL, and the youngest player in history to win the AFL MVP. He was ranked after the 2016 season as the Yankees' top prospect by Baseball America. Torres was listed as the fifth best prospect in baseball entering the 2017 season by Baseball America. After hitting .448 in 29 at bats with two home runs in spring training with the Yankees, Torres began the 2017 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. In April, he went on the seven-day disabled list with rotator cuff inflammation. The Yankees promoted Torres to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League in May. In June, Torres slid headfirst into home, despite the fact that the Yankees stress to their players to slide feet-first because the team believes it is safer, and tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his non- throwing left elbow. On June 19, Torres was ruled out for the rest of the 2017 season after it was determined that his injury required Tommy John surgery. He finished the 2017 season batting .287/.383/.480 with seven home runs and 34 RBI for the two teams combined. The Yankees added him to their 40-man roster after the season. Entering the 2018 season, Torres was labeled as the fifth- best prospect in baseball and the best shortstop prospect by MLB.com. During spring training, Torres competed with Miguel Andujar and other infielders for a spot on the opening day roster. On March 13, 2018, Torres was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to begin the year. He was pulled out of the game on April 22 after six innings. Torres misunderstood thinking it was a punishment for not hustling enough but after the game he was called into manager Bobby Mitchell's office where he heard of his promotion to the Major Leagues. Major Leagues 2018 Torres during Players Weekend in 2018 Torres made his MLB debut on April 22, 2018, as the second-baseman against the Toronto Blue Jays, going 0 for 4. The next day, against the Minnesota Twins, Torres recorded his first MLB hit. On May 4, Torres hit his first career home run, off Josh Tomlin, which at the age of 21 was the youngest Yankee to homer since John Ellis in 1969. Two days later, against the Cleveland Indians, Torres hit his first career walk-off, a home run off of relief pitcher Dan Otero, becoming the youngest Yankee to hit a walk-off homer and giving the Yankees a 7‚Äì4 victory. On May 21, against the Texas Rangers, Torres recorded his first multi-homer game when he hit two home runs as the Yankees won 10‚Äì5. On May 25 against the Los Angeles Angels, Torres hit a home run in his fourth straight game; at 21 years and 163 days old, he became the youngest player in American League history to accomplish that feat. Torres was named AL Player of the Week for the week ending on May 27, when he hit .368/.429/1.158 with five home runs and nine RBIs. On May 29, Torres hit a walk-off single to beat the Houston Astros in extra innings. Torres was also named American League Rookie of the Month for May. He slashed of .317/.374/.659 scoring 13 runs, 26 hits, nine home runs and 24 RBI. On July 4, Torres went on the 10-day disabled list due to a right hip strain. After batting .294 with 15 home runs and 42 RBI over 218 at-bats and boasting a .905 OPS, Torres was selected to the 2018 All- Star Game, his first All-Star appearance, but he did not play in the game. For the week ending on September 2, Torres was once again named AL Player of the week. On September 29, Torres hit the Yankees 265th home run of 2018, surpassing the 1997 Seattle Mariners for most home runs in a single season. In addition, it was the 20th home run in the 9th spot of the order, making the Yankees the first team in history to have 20 home runs from every batting spot in the lineup. He played most of his games for 2018 at second base, despite playing primarily at shortstop during his minor-league career, due to the shortstop position being taken by Didi Gregorius. 2019 For his sophomore season, on April 4, 2019, Torres became the fourth youngest Yankee with four hits and three extra base hits in a game since Joe DiMaggio did it in 1936. Torres went 4 for 4 with a double, two home runs and four RBI against the Baltimore Orioles. On June 19, 2019, Torres hit his 39th career home run and his first career grand slam off of Oliver Drake of the Tampa Bay Rays. Torres hit his second career grand slam on August 2, 2019 against Eduardo Rodr√≠guez of the Boston Red Sox.

His 39 home runs made him the second ever middle infielder after Alex Rodriguez to do so before turning 23, and third Yankees player since DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle to hit at least two 20+ HR seasons before the age of 23. Torres finished the 2019 regular season batting .278. and went on to hit .481 in the 2019 American League Division Series. On October 13, 2019, Torres became the youngest second baseman in MLB history, third youngest overall (Mantle, Tony Kubek) to score 4+ RBI in a game, & youngest ever for 5+.

Tools for modesty Prior to the invention of the stethoscope, a physician who wanted to perform auscultation to listen to heart sounds or noise inside a body would have to physically place their ear against the body of the person being examined. In 1816, male physician Ren√© Laennec invented the stethoscope as a way to respect the modesty of a female patient, as it would have been awkward for him to put his ear on her chest. Hospital gowns increase modesty as compared to the patient presenting nude, but in the past have been odd clothing which exposes the body. Some contemporary changes to the design of hospital gowns are proposed. Society and culture In places with more cultural diversity it becomes more likely that people will make new and different requests for modesty in health care. Special populations Sometimes women do not access healthcare because of modesty concerns. Muslims in non-Muslim societies sometimes make requests for modesty.

Life Rachel Fanny Antonina Dashwood was the illegitimate daughter of Sir Francis Dashwood. Her father was Chancellor of the Exchequer and the notorious founder of the Hellfire Club. He gave her about ¬£40,000 after she had been educated at a French convent. She was later reported to be \\"deplorably ignorant of English life and life universally\\". Dashwood lodged for a time with a Mrs. Gordon in Kensington Square, and met her two sons, Loudoun and Lockhart, when they returned on holiday from their boarding schools. She later married Matthew Lee in Scotland as she was under age. The attraction was said to be her husband's good looks but the marriage lasted less than two years. Mrs Lee went to live in Manchester but she was in London in 1803 when she was kidnapped by - or went away with or eloped with - the two Gordon brothers. They had both graduated from Oxford University: Loudoun Harcourt was not rich while Lockhart was not only married but was employed as a clergyman. The circumstance of their journey together are disputed. The party of three was intercepted after concerns were raised by Lee's guardians, and Lee later sued them for her abduction. Loudoun was said to have visited her room in Gloucester, whereas Lee said that she was being threatened with a pistol. The trial of Loudoun and Lockhart took place on 6 March 1804 in Oxford based on the accusations of Lee. Witnesses were called and the judge stopped the case after hearing that Lee did not deny saying to the chambermaid \\"Tell my husband he may come to bed in ten minutes\\". Loudoun Harcourt Gordon's account Apology for the Conduct of the Gordons... records it was abandoned when it was revealed that Lee denied the Christian faith. The accused brothers were acquitted and they claimed vindication in Loudoun's book published in 1804. The Judge ruled that during their time in Oxfordshire Lee had freely consented to travelling with the Gordon brothers. Lee now had symptoms of paranoia and because of this she felt threatened, even by the Gloucestershire clergyman who had agreed to look after her. Despite her symptoms she published A Vindication of Mrs Lee's Conduct in 1807 and the following year she had an Essay on Government published. Matthew Lee killed himself in 1807 and she moved back to London. Over the next few years she learnt Hebrew and she continued to publish her views. She died in 1829.

It was commissioned by the Soviet Union's Committee of Arts Affairs as a pedagogical work for talented violin students. It is therefore a non-virtuosic piece, and was originally designed to be played not by one soloist but by multiple young performers in unison. It was not performed until 10 July 1959 - six years after Prokofiev's death - by Ruggiero Ricci at the Moscow Conservatory. Structure and Analysis The three movements of the sonata are as follows: #Moderato #Andante dolce. Tema con variazioni #Con brio. Allegro precipitato The work is composed in Classical style and its melodies are largely diatonic. The first movement is in sonata form, the second movement is a theme with five variations, and the third movement has characteristics of a mazurka.

KogƒÉlniceanu Street. Soon after the 1918 union of Transylvania with Romania and the subsequent establishment of a Romanian-language university in Cluj, the idea of a building for use by teaching staff came into being. The planned site were the land and building occupied by the old Hungarian theatre, which was in an advanced state of degradation and had come under the university's ownership. In 1926, upon the suggestion of Emil Racovi»õƒÉ, the university senate discussed the matter, hiring an architect who drew up plans and a cost estimate. With total expenditures coming to some 24 million lei, beyond the university's possibilities at the time, the project was temporarily dropped. In 1932, the university's new rector, Florian »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ, revived the idea. Due to his prestige and political connections, he was able to persuade Prime Minister Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu to come to Cluj. At a joint session of the Romanian Cabinet and the university senate held in May 1934, the university obtained a commitment for 44 million lei from the government, to cover the planned building and improvements to extant facilities. The rector had three main purposes in mind for the college: as a place where Cluj university professors could meet professors from other Romanian cities and abroad, scientists from other institutions and students; as a place for organizing university events and cultural performances; as a place for students to meet and hold activities pertaining to student life, such as student societies, a cafeteria and dances. \\"Colegiul Academic al UniversitƒÉ≈£ii clujene (Casa Universitarilor)\\" at the Babe»ô-Bolyai University site Construction began in the autumn of 1934, following demolition of the old theatre. Under the supervision of a Bucharest architect, building lasted until November 1936, with the cost reaching 30 million lei. The college was inaugurated in June 1937, in the presence of King Carol II, cabinet members and other local and national officials. On this occasion, the king was conferred an honorary doctorate, and the building was styled \\"Carol II Academic College\\". The new building had a large, 1000-seat auditorium for conferences, balls and concerts; a small auditorium with 300 seats; a cafeteria that could fit 500; offices for student societies, rooms for housing foreign visitors, and a recreation area for professors with a conference room, a library and a billiard table. Between 1940 and 1945, as a result of the Second Vienna Award's grant of Northern Transylvania to Hungary, it was named after Matthias Corvinus. Under the communist regime, it was called Casa Universitarilor (\\"University House\\"), regaining its old name in the 2000s. The building is considered a historic monument by Romania's Culture Ministry. In 2014, a memorial plaque was unveiled on the college, featuring the names of King Carol, TƒÉtƒÉrescu and »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ.

Health  Sexophobia in the clinical talk has an effect on the way patients speak to their doctors, as it manifests itself in the communication strategies that are employed to speak about private health problems. In that sense, the use of neutral and veiled vocabulary by doctors can discourage patients to speak openly about their sexual issues.

Background The event took place during the UFC's annual International Fight Week. The event was expected to be headlined by a UFC Featherweight Championship bout between the then champion Jos√© Aldo and Conor McGregor. On June 23, it was reported that Aldo suffered a rib fracture and pulled out of the bout in light of the injury. On June 30, it was confirmed that Aldo indeed pulled out of the bout and that the interim championship bout would take place at this event. The bout remained the event headliner. On July 1, photographs of Aldo's scans were released and indicated that he had indeed suffered a fractured rib. On July 10, White claimed that Aldo did not have a broken rib as \\"every x-ray he sent out was of an old injury\\". He reaffirmed that Aldo had a \\"bruised rib and cartilage\\" and that the biggest problem was the weight cutting process being complicated by the injury. They later fought at UFC 194 The co-main event featured a UFC Welterweight Championship bout between then champion Robbie Lawler and top contender Rory MacDonald. Their first fight at UFC 167 ended in a split decision victory for Lawler. Matt Brown was briefly linked to a bout with Nate Diaz at the event. However, in mid-April, Brown announced that the pairing had been scrapped. Brown remained on the card against Tim Means. A welterweight bout between Jake Ellenberger and Stephen Thompson was initially expected to take place at this event. However, in mid-May, the bout was made the main event of The Ultimate Fighter: American Top Team vs. Blackzilians Finale which took place a day later at the same venue. John Hathaway was expected to face Gunnar Nelson at the event. However, on June 23, Hathaway pulled out of the bout due to an injury. This prompted a shift in another welterweight bout on the card as Brandon Thatch was pulled from his fight against John Howard to face Nelson, while Cathal Pendred was announced as Howard's new opponent. Pendred had previously fought only 28 days before the event, when he defeated Augusto Monta√±o at UFC 188. Jeremy Stephens missed weight on his first attempt, coming in 3.5 lb overweight at 149.5 lb. After having made no attempts to cut further, he was fined 20 percent of his fight purse, which went to Dennis Bermudez.

This was in response to several Palestinian rocket attacks on northern Israel during the Lebanese Civil War. Buildings, bridges and other infrastructure across Lebanon were either destroyed or badly damaged, and according to Palestinian and Lebanese reports, the operation left from 123 to over 300 killed. Israel vowed to continue fighting the PLO until the latter ceased to launch rockets into Israeli territory, while the PLO said that the bombing would not go unpunished. Background The air raids came in response to continuous Palestinian rocket attacks into northern Israel for a third consecutive day. Four women were injured when a Palestinian rocket hit a maternity hospital in Nahariya, as well as three other town residents. This followed the significant amount of Soviet weaponry delivered to the Palestinians, including Katyusha rocket launchers. Air strikes were reported shortly after the Lebanese radio announcement that the country's leftist forces had called for the establishment of a Soviet SA-6 anti-aircraft missile system in Beirut. Events =Bombings and damage= The bombing of Beirut on 17 July lasted between 20-30 minutes, and was mostly centered on predominantly Muslim districts, such as Rue Baghdadi in the Fakehani district west of the city. Israeli warplanes demolished a seven-story apartment building and four to five others were badly damaged. Israel said that the operation targeted the headquarters of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), claiming that the Israeli military had managed to destroy the offices of some of the guerrilla groups that form the PLO, including one Fatah and two DFLP offices. The PLO stated that Arafat's headquarters were unharmed and that only one DFLP office sustained some damage. In addition to Beirut, the port city of Sidon as well as the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps were also attacked. A number of bridges across the Litani and Zahrani rivers, including a vital bridge south of Sidon, Israeli gunboat shelling along the coast between the Saadiyat village in the south and the Zahrani oil terminal had destroyed 200 yards of the main coastal road in the area. The Trans-Arabian Pipeline refinery was also damaged, and a part of it was in flames. Israel claimed that all of its jets returned home safely, while the PLO and Syria claimed that a plane had been shot down. A Damascus radio report said that the aircraft had been downed by Syrian ground forces in southeastern Lebanon, and that it had crashed near Marjayoun. =Casualties= Precise casualty figures were not immediately available. There were both Lebanese and Palestinian fatalities, as well as a French volunteer, Nicolas Guillaume Royer, who was killed at a DFLP office. Two Lebanese newspapers published lists of the dead and wounded. Palestinian reports claimed that at least 123 were killed and 550 were wounded, while Lebanon's police put the death toll in Beirut alone at around 90. Lebanon's UN spokesman said that 300 people or more may have been killed. Reactions Arafat said in a statement: \\"The bloodshed today will not go unpunished, and it will only increase our will to keep up the struggle against the American and Zionist criminals.\\" Arafat also told Arab states that he needed \\"their swords, not their blessing\\". Israel stressed that it had acted in self- defense, with Prime Minister Menachem Begin warning that the Israeli military would no longer refrain from attacking Palestinian guerrilla targets, even if they were stationed in civilian areas. Begin added that the PLO had \\"no immunity\\" anymore, and that if civilians were hit, it would be their fault. At Lebanon's request, the United Nations Security Council held a two-hour emergency meeting, after which it demanded Israel to cease its bombing operations. The United States announced it would delay the planned shipment of F-16 fighter jets to Israel in response to the events.

She has protested against Muslims inside Muslim places of worship, against gay rights, and holiday traditions like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. She asserted in a now-viral video that the logo of Monster Energy sports drink depicts the Number of the Beast. She has been spoofed on Comedy Central. Her life and activities have been profiled in The Washington Post among other places. Biography Christine Weick is from Michigan. She was born in 1964\\\\. Weick has given a number of interviews over the years describing growing up in a strict Christian Reformed family. She was not allowed to watch TV or listen to music. At some point she rebelled and turned to witchcraft. \\"It was the ultra- form of rebellion against God, to worship the devil outright,\\" she said. She had a baby in high-school out of wedlock, was convinced by her mother to marry the father, then proceed to cheat on him regularly. After their divorce she married her second husband. Her new step-daughter owned a heavy-metal music CD by White Zombie which contained satanic lyrics that she found shocking; from that point in 1995 onward she turned to God. Activism  In 2011 she published the book Explain This! A Verse by Verse Explanation of the Book of Revelation. In October 2013 she drove to Detroit from Hopkins, Michigan to protest against same-sex marriage in Michigan with a sign which said \\"God opposes gay marriage\\". In May 2014 Weick protested against gay rights on Mother's Day in Grandville, Michigan, holding a sign that read \\"Thank your mom today for not being gay.\\" The protest was filmed by a local news station, who also filmed an angry woman who threw a strawberry-flavored slush beverage at Weick. In November 2014, a video of Weick speculating a relation between Monster Energy and Satan was published on YouTube, garnering over eleven million views as of 2018. The \\"success\\" of the video got her on Comedy Central's Tosh.0 Web Redemption. This was not the first time she had made this claim. She speculated the same thing on a podcast several years earlier. Monster Energy denied that her complaints reflected their product. Also in November 2014, Weick protested at a Muslim prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral. Weick stood up and shouted, \\"Jesus Christ died on that cross. He is the reason we are to worship only Him. Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior.\\" She was promptly escorted out. She was reportedly living out of her car at the time of this incident. In January 2015, Christine attended the 7th Annual Texas Muslim Capitol Day with several other protestors who carried pro-Christian signs. At one point during a speech, Christine interrupted the speaker by taking the microphone away from her and proclaimed Jesus Christ as the Savior and said that Islam would never take over Texas or the United States. Weick approached a speaker at the event from behind and grabbed the microphone, declaring that \\"Islam will never dominate in the United States, and by the grace of God it will not dominate Texas.\\" In February 2015, she interrupted another event, referred to as \\"Muslim Day\\" at the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She was removed from the building while trying to recite the Lord's Prayer during a Muslim call to prayer. On October 30, 2015, Weick protested the Greater Church of Lucifer located in Spring, Texas. During the TV interview, she said, \\"This is what we get when we have Freedom of Religion!\\" She has protested some church Easter events. She yelled at a person dressed as the Easter Bunny in a Tennessee church parking lot, \\"You are nothing more than Santa Claus coming into a Christian Church! Shame on you!\\" She protested at the First Freewill Baptist Church's Easter egg hunt.

It is one of the leading manufacturers of household appliances in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The company consists of three plants, the oldest and most important being the Minsk Refrigerator Plant (), which produces household and commercial refrigerators and freezers, and by which name the entire enterprise is sometimes called. An abbreviated name for this plant is MZKh (), and Minsk is the former brand used for the company's refrigerators. In addition, Atlas owns and operates the Baranovichi Machine-Tool Plant (which produces compressors, technological systems for plastics processing, and conveyor systems) and the Household Appliances Plant (which produces washing machines and other electrical appliances). History =Background= Production of domestic refrigerators lagged in the Soviet Union compared to some other countries. The first Soviet domestic refrigerators were produced at the Kharkov Tractor Factory in 1937, but World War II soon caused production to be halted. This, and the subsequent devastation of Soviet industry, delayed the mass production of refrigerators until the 1960s, while iceboxes continued in common use. Authorization for the building of a plant in Minsk to produce electric refrigerators was established by the Council of Ministers of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic by resolution 554 on August 24, 1959. The location selected for the plant was near Victory Park in the northwest sector of Minsk, which at that time was in the Soviet Union. =Under the Soviet Union= The first refrigerator (a CRS-125 Minsk-1 ()) was delivered in June 1962. These were the first modern Soviet refrigerators with incorporated freezers and polyurethane insulation. Mass production of Minsk-2 refrigerators began in 1964. By 1971, production facilities had been expanded, and the factory's one millionth refrigerator was produced in that year. A Minsk Model 10 refrigerator from approximately 1980In 1973, the Minsk-7 refrigerator was first produced. This model included polyurethane foam insulation, and with it began the export of refrigerators to countries outside the Soviet bloc. A consignment of refrigerators was delivered to Greece in 1973, and in the following years models were exported to France, England, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Australia, and also to Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, China, and Spain and elsewhere ‚Äì a total of 21 countries. Interior of a Model 10In 1974, the first Minsk-17 freezer was produced, and in 1976 the Minsk Refrigerator Plant was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour for the design and production of high quality household refrigerators. In 1977 the umbrella organization Atlas was created, consisting of the Minsk Refrigerator Plant as the parent company, and also the Smolensk Refrigerator Plant in Russia and the Alytus Refrigerator Plant and Ma≈æeikiai Compressor Plant, both in Lithuania. In 1979, the factory's one millionth refrigerator was exported, and in 1987, the factory's ten millionth refrigerator was produced. =Post- Soviet crisis and survival= The collapse of the Soviet Union disrupted Atlas's ties with suppliers, markets, and constituent plants, and almost led to the demise of the company, but it survived and eventually thrived. With the independence of Belarus and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1990, Atlas was reduced to just the Minsk Refrigerator Plant, but in that same year the Baranovichi Machine-Tool Plant for the production of compressors for refrigerators and freezers was founded as part of Atlas. In 1993 Atlas was reformed as a corporation consisting of the Minsk Refrigerator Factory and Baranovichi Machine-Tool Plant, and the first batch of compressors was shipped by the Baranovichi Plant. In 1994 Atlas produced its one millionth compressor. In 1995, preparation for production of refrigerators and freezers with the ozone-friendly refrigerant R134a commenced, and in 1997 production of these types began. Also in 1997, upgrades were made to the Baranovichi Plant's production, transport, storage, and assembly systems. In 1998 the first 700 Series refrigerators were produced, and the first two-compressor refrigerator, the MXM-1704. Also in 1998, the Belarus State Committee on Standardization, Measurement, and Certification issued the Minsk Refrigerator Plant a certificate of compliance to ISO 9001-96 for the design, manufacture, and servicing of refrigerators and freezers and an ISO 9002 certificate of compliance for quality management systems. In 1999 the Minsk Refrigerator Plant was awarded a quality prize by the government, to be followed by similar prizes in 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, and other years. =21st century= In 2001, the Minsk Refrigerator Plant began producing refrigerated cabinets with glass doors (such as are used in stores to cool and display soda bottles and so forth). Also in 2001, the Baranovichi Plant delivered its first production batch of equipment for plastics processing - the BZST 125/250 injection molding models - and produced its ten millionth compressor. And in the same year, the Republic of Belarus issued the Minsk Refrigerator Plant a certificate of compliance with the ISO 14001-2000 environmental management standard and confirmed the previously issued ISO 9001-96 certificate. In 2003, the Household Appliances Plant produced the first Atlas washing machines. The Minsk Refrigerator Plant was issued a certificate of compliance with ISO 9001-2000 by the government, and commenced production of small lightweight mini-refrigerators, for use in offices, hotel rooms, etc. In 2004, production began of the New Wave model refrigerators with electronic controls and displays, and the Household Appliances Plant produced the first Atlas ranges with flat glass-ceramic cooktops. In 2005, the Baranovichi Plant produced the first Atlas electric kettles, and in 2006 Atlas produced its 25 millionth refrigerator and 20 millionth compressor. In 2008, the Baranovichi Plant was commissioned to produce a new line of high-performance compressors under license from the Danish firm Danfoss. The Minsk Refrigerator Plant produced its first built-in refrigerators, the XM 4007, and a Class A energy efficiency model which reduced energy consumption up to 30%. 2009 saw the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Minsk Refrigerator Plant; in the same year, the plant launched a refrigerator line using equipment from the German company Eisenmann which allows refrigerators to be painted in various colors, and produced the Atlas XM 6016 of energy efficiency Class A+. The Minsk Refrigerator Plant now produces many types of refrigerators and freezers, with various differences in capacity (from 30 to 400 liters), functional capabilities (single-chamber and dual-chamber, with top or bottom location of the freezer, with one or two compressors), and market segment (domestic and commercial). Atlas also produces 26 models of washing machines, two models of electric kettles, and gas and electric stoves. Products under the Atlas brand have long been popular and known far beyond the borders of the Republic of Belarus. As of 2015, Atlas refrigerators are exported to the nine other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, nine other countries in Europe, and Mongolia. The ATLANT trademark wins the first place in the Refrigerator category at the Success Favorites ‚Äì 2012 International Contest in Ukraine (the contest purpose is to recognize the most successful trademarks in the Ukrainian market). The company's existing quality management system is recertified in the National System for Conformity Attestation, with the certificate issued. For the Minsk Refrigerator Plant and the Household Appliance Plant, the existing quality management system is certified in the German Accreditation System (DAkkS), with the certificate issued. The 63rd Series of refrigerators with the Super fresh box (the freshness zone) is launched in production. Since April 2013, the CT series compressors designed in-house were launched into production; these compressors are suitable for producing refrigerators with energy efficiency class of A+++. In 2014, Atlas freezers won the award for Best of the Year in the freezers category at the international Best of the Year competition held in the Ukraine.

Early life Rachel Mary Parsons was born in 1885, to Sir Charles Algernon Parsons and his wife Katharine (d.1933), the daughter of William Froggatt Bethell of Rise Park, East Riding of Yorkshire. Her brother, Algernon George (Tommy) (b.1886), was killed on 28 April 1918 while a Major in the Royal Field Artillery. Her interest and aptitude for engineering and science was fostered from a young age by the engineering tradition in her family including her grandmother Mary Rosse and grandfather William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse. Her father invented the steam turbine and developed successful international engineering businesses. The family lived on Tyneside (Elvaston Hall, Ryton, and Holeyn Hall, Wylam) and later in Northumberland (Ray Demesne, Kirkwhelpington). She was educated at Newcastle High, Wycombe Abbey, Clarence House (May 1899‚ÄìApril 1900) and finally Roedean from 1900‚Äì1903. In 1910 she entered Newnham College at the University of Cambridge and was one of the first three women to study Mechanical Sciences there although, like all women until 1948, she could not graduate with a degree or become a full member of the University. Nevertheless, she was able to add theoretical knowledge to the practical skills she had already obtained at her father's factory. She left in 1912 having taken the preliminary examination for Part I of the Tripos and a qualifying examination in Mechanical Sciences in 1911. When the First World War broke out, she replaced her brother as a director at the Heaton Works of C. A. Parsons and Company in Newcastle upon Tyne. In particular, she oversaw the recruitment and training of women to replace the men who had left to join the armed forces. She became a leading member of the National Council of Women, and campaigned for equal access for all to technical schools and colleges, regardless of gender. Life after the First World War Following her brother's death, Rachel Parsons did not resume her role as a director of the Heaton Works, possibly because of a rift with her father. As evidence of her continued aspirations in engineering she became a member of The Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1918, continuing to be a member until she died. She and her mother, Katharine, Lady Parsons, were among the founders of the Women's Engineering Society alongside Eleanor, Lady Shelley-Rolls; Margaret, Lady Moir; Laura Annie Willson; Margaret Rowbotham and Janetta Mary Ornsby. The organisation promoted the retention of women engineers after the First World War by opposing the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act 1919, as well as supporting engineering as a career for women. Rachel Parsons became the first president of the Women's Engineering Society (1919‚Äì1921). On 9 April 1919, with Blanche Thornycroft and Eily Keary, she was one of the first three women admitted to the Royal Institution of Naval Architects and from 1921 she became a lifelong member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. She also held a Master Mariner's Certificate. In 1920 Rachel Parsons was one of a group of eight women who founded the engineering company Atalanta Ltd, with her mother Katharine Parsons as chairman and one of the principal shareholders. All the employees were women and the director was Annette Ashberry. The company produced surface plates and machine models. It was initially based in Loughborough, where it was intended that the employees could receive further education at the Loughborough College of Technology. Atalanta moved to London, with premises initially in Fulham Road in 1922 and then Brixton Road in 1925. It was voluntarily wound up in 1928. In 1922 Rachel Parsons bought 5 Portman Square, a large house in London, and began to host social events attended by the elite of London society. That year she became one of the few female members of the London County Council, representing Finsbury for the Municipal Reform Party, and sat on the Electricity and Highways Committee. She stood for Parliament in the 1923 election as the Conservative candidate in the constitutency of Ince, Lancashire, but was not elected. She moved to the larger property of 5 Grosvenor Square in 1926 and continued as a society hostess. She put herself forward for selection as the Conservative candidate for Newcastle in 1940, but was not successful. In 1940 she moved into the countryside at Sunningdale, Berkshire, purchasing Little Court, a Georgian-style house with twenty-five acres of land. However, she also maintained a London residence, living successively in two houses in Belgrave Square. Her interest in horse racing led her to buy the 2600-acre Branches Park estate at Cowlinge near Newmarket, Suffolk, in the 1940s where she built up a large stud farm, as well as in 1954 purchasing the Lansdowne House racing stable in Falmouth Avenue, Newmarket. She had several notable successes from her stables. These included wins in 1953 with Cavalleria, Golden God and Fraise Melba (trained by Geoffrey Brooke) followed by success with Le Dieu D'Or, Golden God and Fraise Melba under trainer Sam Armstrong. Death Rachel Parsons was found dead on 2 July 1956. Stableman Dennis James Pratt, a former employee, was charged with her murder. Defended by Michael Havers, a future attorney-general, Pratt was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of provocation. Rachel's cousin, Canon R. E. Parsons, officiated at her funeral which was held on 6 July at St Mary's church, Newmarket, and attended by, among others, her cousin Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse. She is buried in Newmarket Cemetery.  Commemoration  In 2017, one of six tunnel boring machines for London‚Äôs Thames Tideway Tunnel 'Super Sewer' project was named after Rachel Parsons and began tunnelling from Fulham in 2018. The names were chosen from a shortlist by a public vote.

McCrary, Sr. (October 28, 1905 - September 24, 1989), was a businessman from Arcadia, Louisiana, who represented Bienville Parish as a Democrat in the Louisiana House of Representatives for a single term from 1960 to 1964. His service corresponded with the administration of Governor Jimmie Davis, a native of nearby Jackson Parish in North Louisiana. In 1956, McCrary ran in a special election to fill the seat vacated by Lorris M. Wimberly of Arcadia, the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, who left the legislature after lengthy service to join the administration of Governor Earl Kemp Long as the director of the Louisiana Department of Public Works. McCrary lost to Fletcher Sutton, the mayor of Gibsland, 2,030 to 1,784, in a runoff contest but rebounded to claim the seat for a full term in 1960. In 1964, McCrary was succeeded by another Democrat, businessman Len Lacy of Castor, a member of the Bienville Parish School Board, who also held the seat for one term. Lacy was the last person to have represented only Bienville Parish in the legislature. Until 1968, each parish regardless of its population had been guaranteed a seat in the 105-member Louisiana House. Bienville was thereafter combined with Jackson Parish. E. L. Henry, a Democrat from Jonesboro in Jackson Parish, defeated Lacy in the 1967 primary, and in 1972, Henry began an eight-year stint as the Louisiana House Speaker. McCrary and his wife, Ida May McCrary (1908-1997), a native of Eros in Jackson Parish, had three sons, Curtis, Jr., and wife Jackie of Arcadia, Phillip R.

Rolling Stone Country debuted a video for \\"Let Go\\" from Struthers' album Wake with an article in which Stephen L. Betts wrote that \\"the ever-widening scope of Nora Jane Struthers' musicality means that placing a neat, easy label on the genre she best represents is virtually impossible.\\" In a post for Amy Poehler's blog Smart Girls, Alexa Peters wrote that \\"Nora Jane is entirely and unequivocally herself, and wants to encourage you to do the same.\\" National Public Radio (United States) described Struthers as \\"quietly brilliant\\" in article headlined \\"Country Music's Year of the Woman.\\" Struthers' 2013 album Carnival, recorded with her touring band The Party Line, spent more than three months in the Top 20 of Americana Radio charts and peaked at No. 7. Carnival ranked 24th on the 2013 Americana Airplay Top 100 list. In a review of Carnival, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that Struthers' unique brand of \\"rich storytelling, repeat-worth melodies and a modern mashup of traditional, bluegrass folk, country and rock influences\\" sets her apart from many roots-inspired contemporaries. Early life and education Struthers was born in Fairfax, Virginia, United States, six months before her family moved to Avon, Conn. When Struthers was four years old, the family moved again to Ridgewood, New Jersey. She grew up singing and playing music with her father Alan Struthers, a bluegrass musician. Struthers was named Nora by her parents after Nora Charles, a character in Dashiell Hammett's novel The Thin Man, and Jane after English author Jane Austen. Her family called her Jane, but Nora stuck in school when that name was used for calling roll in kindergarten. Struthers said as a little girl she would often watch out the front window for her father at the end of the day and greet him with a yodel and the two frequented bluegrass festivals and fiddler conventions along the East Coast as she got older. Struthers was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four, when a reading specialist told her parents that Nora Jane would never go to college. She ultimately proved the reading specialist wrong, however, studying English Education and Africana Studies at New York University's School of Education. After graduating in 2005, Struthers worked as a teacher at The Williamsburg Charter High School in Brooklyn, New York, until 2008. Career Struthers played shows with her father under the name Dirt Road Sweetheart and the duo released an album titled I Heard The Bluebirds Sing on May 11, 2008. In 2008, Struthers gave up her job as a teacher and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career as a full-time musician. She soon began touring with a band of rotating musicians she dubbed The Bootleggers and ultimately won the prestigious Telluride Bluegrass Festival band contest in June 2010. Struthers released a self-titled debut solo album on July 10, 2010. Nora Jane Struthers, produced by Brent Truitt, featured established musicians such as multi-instrumentalist Tim O'Brien and fiddler Stuart Duncan. Struthers joined Americana acoustic quintet Bearfoot later in 2010 and the group released the album American Story in 2011, which featured six songs written or co-written by Struthers. One of them, \\"Tell Me a Story,\\" became a top-rated video on Country Music Television. Struthers had written a collection of songs for a new solo album by 2012 and launched a Kickstarter campaign that raised $22,000 in less than four weeks to help fund it. She formed a touring band called The Party Line and released the 14-track Carnival on April 16, 2013, again produced by Truitt. Struthers and The Party Line gave nearly 150 live performances across the U.S. in 2013. Struthers said she achieved a childhood dream by playing in the Saturday Night All Star Jam at the Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival in Oak Hill, New York that year. Struthers and The Party Line released a six-song record titled Country EP No. 1 in July 2014. One of the tracks, a cover of The Everly Brothers classic \\"(Til) I Kissed You\\" was featured on a collection of Americana music called Native: Americana Spotlight, released on September 9, 2014 on Tone Tree Music.

Krumbein (1847November 1907) was an architect based in Portland, Oregon, United States, whose work included Richardsonian Romanesque designs and Italianate, cast-iron architecture. Little of his work survived the 20th Century. Early life and education Krumbein was born in 1847 near Hamburg, Germany. At the age of 15, he became a student of architecture at the Hannover Polytechnic School, and he graduated with honors in 1867. He returned to Hamburg and worked as an architectural drafter for two years, then in 1869 he immigrated to the United States under the name Fritz Krumbein. Career Krumbein arrived in San Francisco on July 9, 1869, and he worked in architectural firms until 1871. In that year he moved to Portland and formed a partnership with contractor Elwood M. Burton. Soon thereafter he formed a partnership with W. G. Gilbert. =Gilbert and Krumbein= During his partnership with Gilbert, Krumbein designed the 1871 Jacob Kamm House. Gilbert and Krumbein were selected in 1872 to design the Oregon State Capitol Building in Salem. The building featured cast-iron ornamentation over brick and limestone, and construction required 400 masons. Total cost was less than $200,000. When construction was completed in 1876, Krumbein was forced to petition the Oregon legislature for remittance of his unpaid fees in the amount of $733.80. The building burned in 1935 and was replaced in 1936. =Williams and Krumbein= The firm Gilbert and Krumbein dissolved soon after the Oregon State Capitol Building award, and in 1874 Krumbein formed a new partnership with Warren Heywood Williams. The partnership lasted until 1878, and in at least one case the design credit between the two partners would later be in dispute.See Richard B. Knapp House in Williams and Krumbein designed the First Presbyterian Church of Seattle in 1876, later demolished. The architects also have been credited with designing the Fechheimer & White Building, although the building was constructed after the partnership ended.Authorities have offered 1870 as another year for construction of the building, but in that case Williams and Krumbein were not yet associated, see In characterizing the differences between Williams and Krumbein, architectural historian William J. Hawkins observed, \\"Of the two major architects of the cast-iron era in Portland, Warren H. Williams and Justus Krumbein, the latter probably left the more exuberant legacy. While Williams' work displayed the elegance and refinement for which Victorian Portland was famous, Krumbein's work often veered toward the spectacular.\\"Quoted in the Chinatown/Japantown Historic District continuation sheet, see =Other projects= A 1905 engraving of Lewis and Clark Memorial Hall, designed by Justus F. Krumbein After his work with Williams ended, Krumbein continued in business without a partner. He designed the Couch and Failing schools (both demolished) for Portland Public Schools in the early 1880s. In 1892 Krumbein designed the Ancient Order of United Workmen Temple at SW Second and Taylor Street in downtown Portland. The Richardsonian Romanesque building has been described as \\"brooding\\" and \\"foreboding.\\" Although attributed to Krumbein, the building may have been designed by his drafter, Lionel Deane. The Bickel Block at NW First and Couch Street was constructed in 1883 and became part of the Portland campus of the University of Oregon, known as the White Stag Block, in 2006. The Bickel building features Italianate, cast-iron architecture. In 1884 Krumbein designed the Kamm Block, a building that has been described as one of Portland's most decorative and palatial. After fire destroyed parts of the building in 1892 and again in 1939, it was demolished in 1948. Krumbein was one of seven architects chosen to design exhibition halls for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. After a brief illness, Krumbein died in 1907 at the age of 60.

Originally, Katz sold the network to affiliated TV stations via ad split, but by October 2015, had moved to carriage fees in exchange for the network getting the ad inventory due to greater inventory with stations adding a third or fourth subchannel.:1 Their networks used direct response advertising as a meter of viewers before switching to Nielsen rating C-3.:3 History Katz Broadcasting, LLC was founded on February 3, 2014 by Jonathan Katz, who serves as chief operating officer of Bounce TV and formerly served as an executive at the Turner Broadcasting System. The company was announced concurrently with the announced launches of its first two networks, Escape and Grit, which were both launched that April with Univision and UniM√°s owned-and- operated stations run by Univision Communications serving as its charter station group; both of Katz's initial networks are targeted at individual genders (with Grit aimed at men and Escape aimed at women). Besides Jonathan Katz, some of the initial investors included some Bounce investors notably Raycom Media and Al Haymon. At some point, E. W. Scripps Company also becomes an owner purchasing 5% of the company. Katz and Bounce Media share staff from the former company's launch, including Jonathan Katz (who serves as president and chief executive officer of Katz, while continuing to serve as chief operating officer) and Jeffrey Wolf (Katz's chief distribution officer and Bounce's executive vice president of network distribution). Katz and Bounce continued to share executive staff with the hiring announcement of Jim Weiss (a former executive at sports marketing agency CSE) as the former's senior vice president of corporate communications in August. On January 18, 2015, Katz Broadcasting announced the launch of its third specialty network, Laff, a comedy-focused network that was tapped for an April 15 debut with ABC Owned Television Stations and Scripps serving as its core charter affiliate groups. On March 24, 2015, Katz signed a multi-network agreement with the Meredith Corporation that would add all three Katz-owned networks to Meredith-owned stations in five markets, boosting Laff's national coverage to 50%, Escape's to 58%, and Grit's to 78% of all U.S. television markets. Escape and Grit switched from direct response advertising as a meter of viewers to Neilsen rating C-3 late 2015 with Laff expected to follow suit.:3 On June 15, 2016, Katz Broadcasting signed a multi-network agreement with Nexstar Broadcasting Group and operated affiliated TV station companies that would bring all three Katz-owned networks (as well as Bounce TV) to stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar in 54 markets, jumping national coverage of both Escape and Laff to 85% and Grit's coverage to 93%. On August 1, 2017, Scripps announced the purchase of Katz and its three networks plus Bounce which Katz operates, for $292 million, acquiring the other 95% of the company. Katz will remain based out of Atlanta, Georgia as an autonomous division of Scripps. The purchase was completed on October 2, 2017. In December 2018, Turner Broadcasting sold the rights to the brand and programming library of defunct cable network Court TV (which relaunched as TruTV in 2008) to Katz, with plans to re-launch it as an over-the-air digital network in May 2019.

Overview The film opens with a photo of John Biever, Walter Iooss, Mickey Palmer and Tony Tomsic meeting in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1967 right before Super Bowl I. The film goes on to discuss how each man got into the photography business, and centers around their work during Super Bowl XLVIII. It also talks about multiple near misses for members of the group, including Palmer checking himself out of a hospital after a heart attack, right before Super Bowl X. At the time of the release of the film, three of the four men were in their seventies, and a fourth was well into his sixties. Production According to director Neil Leifer, he aimed to show how hard it was to film the game, stating, > And I probably didn't succeed in one thing that I wanted to do. I wanted to > show how difficult it is to do what these guys do ... If I could re-edit it > I would probably make that point, even just to show what it's like to go > from the hotel to the stadium.

In addition, the tool also organized one's calendar and shared files. This application provided for integration with cloud storage platforms such as Dropbox, OneDrive, and iCloud; it also carried support for Microsoft Exchange and Gmail. Acompli launched on 24 April 2014. The startup company, which had $7.3 million in funding, was led by CEO Javier Soltero, J.J. Zhuang (CTO) and Kevin Henrikson (VP of Engineering). First released in April 2014 by the venture capital-backed startup of the same name, Acompli was acquired by Microsoft in December 2014. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook Mobile‚Äîsharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook desktop personal information manager and Outlook.com email service.  History  Acompli was co-founded as a startup by Javier Soltero, the former chief technology officer of VMWare, alongside JJ Zhuang (CTO), and Kevin Henrikson (VP of Engineering). It received $7.3 million in funding from Redpoint Ventures, Harrison Metal and Felicis Ventures. In order to distinguish itself from other recent email startups, such as Mailbox, Soltero decided to target the enterprise market‚Äîparticularly, users of Microsoft Exchange servers. He felt that such users had been underserved by the lacking or non-existent support for Exchange in existing mail apps, believing that their developers‚Äîdespite its wide adoption, \\"do not fathom the possibility of anyone using Exchange.\\" A result of this mandate was the decision to make the app a personal information manager rather than only an email client, integrating a calendar, a list of recent contacts, and a list of recent files from attachments and cloud storage services. Acompli was first released on April 25, 2014 for iOS. An Android version was released in September 2014. On November 26, 2014, an incomplete post on its official blog prematurely revealed that Acompli had been acquired by Microsoft. The acquisition, valued at over $200 million, was officially announced on December 1, 2014. Rajesh Jha, vice president of Microsoft's Outlook division, stated that \\"We‚Äôre excited about what‚Äôs possible as we build on the app‚Äôs success and bring it together with work currently in progress by the Outlook team.\\" Soltero assured users that the Acompli app would not be discontinued, and would continue to receive regular updates. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook Mobile, uniting it with one of its original influences. Purpose The goal of Acompli was for users to be able to experience, on a mobile device, the full email functionality that a desktop computer normally provides. This mobile application's \\"innovation is its focus on bringing multiple features like calendaring, contacts, and file management into the application to ease the pain of application switching.\\" Features Engadget reported that Acompli featured \\"three integrated hubs: \\"Calendar,\\" \\"Files\\" and \\"People,\\" each with its own tab at the bottom of the screen,\\" which eliminates the issue of app switching. Acompli prioritized email messages in order of importance and provides an integrated calendar view. Priority was given to the response rate to a particular contact and emails from frequently replied contacts were termed \\"Focused\\" messages. Users were able to delete emails by swiping their dominant thumb from right to left halfway across the screen. The mobile app also associated with other cloud storage platforms, including Dropbox, in addition to Google Drive and OneDrive (SkyDrive). Ryan Lawler of TechCrunch stated that Acompli \\"adds file management and scheduling directly into your inbox\\". Moreover, \\"calendaring and location sharing is built right into new email composition.\\" Acompli supported \\"Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, Google Apps, Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, Outlook.com, Hotmail, MSN and Live.\\" In order to find a desired email, Acompli users were able to use \\"smart filters\\". This mobile application did this by sending one's \\"emails, appointments, files and contacts through its own servers to deliver all that data to your device and to make it searchable\\". Joel Mathis in Macworld wrote that Acompli allowed people to \\"browse all email attachments in the attachments list, and send them from your mobile inbox even if the file wasn‚Äôt downloaded to the phone.\\" Acompli also had an autocomplete feature. Reception Acompli received mostly positive reception: James Kendrick of ZDNet considered the app a \\"must-have\\" for bring your own device scenarios, citing its focused inbox, convergence, and support for both personal and business-oriented e-mail platforms. However, he felt that the calendar was not \\"fancy\\", and lacked different view modes. Noting its level of support for Gmail, quicker deletion gesture, along with its \\"clean approach\\" to filtering through emails and other content, Engadget argued that Acompli \\"can be a speedy and powerful tool if you're willing to take the time to learn its nuances.\\" Jordan Novet of VentureBeat wrote that \\"app, which pulls in calendar and contact information and files to help people get more done on their mobile devices, had catapulted to the No. 9 slot in the free productivity-app section of the app store\\" as of 25 April 2014. Joshua Brustein in Bloomberg Businessweek, has written that due to Microsoft's absence from the iPad, programmes like Acompli and Evernote have been successful. Jeremy Schoemaker stated that Acompli has been \\"an absolute game changer\\". On the day of its release, Acompli quickly reached the top 10 free \\"Productivity\\" apps on the iOS App Store.

Dan took part in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, where USA won the gold medal. They defeated Russia 1-0 in the final. McCoy was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Born with spina bifida, McCoy has been an inspiration for perseverance and determination as he continues to challenge himself to rise above his disability.  Biographical Information  Daniel Frank McCoy was born at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh to Mark and Angela (n√©e Piluso) McCoy. McCoy was born with myelomeningocele (Spina Bifida) at lumbar area 3-4 which has resulted in partial paralysis. At the age of 5, McCoy was introduced to the sport of sled hockey by volunteers from Shriners Hospital in Erie, PA who traveled to Pittsburgh twice a month to provide sports therapy for individuals with physical disabilities in the area. At the time, McCoy's three-year-older brother Andrew was beginning to play stand-up hockey. McCoy knew that physically he could not play hockey like his brother but found that sled hockey, where players sit in sleds and propel themselves using two mini hockey sticks equipped with picks on one end, was as challenging. McCoy is one of the original players in the Mighty Penguins Sled Hockey organization and still competes with the senior team as captain. At the age of 8, McCoy watched the 2002 Salt Lake City Paralympic Games in which a fellow Mighty Penguins player, Josh Wirt, was a member of the U.S. National Sled Hockey Team. Seeing Team U.S.A win gold inspired a dream in McCoy to one day compete for the U.S. at the Paralympics. At the age of 14, McCoy was selected for the U.S. Development Sled Hockey Team (Junior Sled Hockey team). At the age of 16, he was selected for the U.S. National Sled Hockey team. His dream of competing for his country came true when he traveled to Sochi in 2014 and competed in the Paralympic's sledge hockey games bringing home gold. In addition to playing sled hockey, McCoy attends the University of Pittsburgh studying communications with plans for graduate studies in the rehabilitation sciences. He is also active in cross-fit, handcycling, and paracanoe.

He was the Special Representative of the President of Northern Cyprus between 2010 and 2012 and again in 2014. He established and led the Toparlanƒ±yoruz Movement and is one of the founders and the current leader of People's Party. Education √ñzersay studied international relations at Ankara University. His 2002 PhD thesis was on the \\"Validity of the 1959‚Äì1960 Cyprus Treaties In International Law\\".  Political career  √ñzersay became involved in the negotiations to solve the Cyprus dispute under President Rauf Denkta≈ü in 2002. He then was a part of President Mehmet Ali Talat's team for the negotiations. He was appointed as the Special Representative of Turkish Cypriot President Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu on 9 May 2010. In May 2012, he founded the Toparlanƒ±yoruz Movement, with the stated aim of combating corruption in politics, increasing transparency in political parties and bureaucracy and bringing about positive change to the political order. This move was disapproved by Eroƒülu and he resigned from his post on 8 June 2012. The movement headed by him criticized the government, political parties, and other institutions such as the Directorate General for Police. On 8 February 2014, √ñzersay was appointed by Eroƒülu as the Chief Negotiator. However, after his announcement of his candidacy for the 2015 presidential election, Eroƒülu removed him from his post on 8 October 2014. √ñzersay ran for President of Northern Cyprus in the 2015 election and finished fourth, thus being eliminated in the first round. However, he received 21.3% of the vote in an election where all four leading candidates received votes between 20% and 30%. His share of the vote was seen as a surprise success, especially given his lack of political history and lack of endorsement from any political party. On 6 January 2016, √ñzersay, along with other founding members, established the People's Party, after leaving the leadership of the Toparlanƒ±yoruz Movement. He stated the party's aim as erasing the old political order based on corruption and the good administration of the Turkish Cypriot people.

The cemetery dates back to 1855 and was laid out by Darlington architect James Pigott Pritchett junior.  History  In 1854, a competition was held to design two chapels, a lodge and entrance gates for the new Boston Cemetery. The first prize was won by Pritchett & Sons of York, the firm of James Pigott Pritchett senior, but it was his son James Pigott Pritchett junior, who had just established his own firm in Darlington, who attended the meeting in July 1854 and was commissioned to prepare plans. He provided the layout for the grounds and plans for the twin chapels and a lodge, all in the gothic style. The layout of the cemetery, lodge and Anglican chapel remain intact, though the nonconformist chapel was demolished in 1961. Notable burials *Herbert Ingram, founder of The Illustrated London News War Graves The cemetery contains the war graves of 82 Commonwealth service personnel. There are 50 from World War I and 30 from World War II. The graves from the former war are scattered throughout the cemetery, most of those from the latter war are in a special war graves plot, behind which is a memorial to civilians of Boston who died by enemy action in the same war. There is also one non-war grave in the war graves plot.BOSTON CEMETERY CWGC Cemetery Report. One of the most curious graves is that of Major Walter George Burnett Dickinson FRSE FRCVS TD (1858-1914) who died of a heart attack 36 hours after the beginning of the First World War whilst requisitioning horses in the Boston area. Due to CWGC rules this still qualifies as an official \\"war death\\", making him, on paper at least, the first Major to die in the war.http://rosma.co.uk/mw/oba/index.php?title=Walter_George_Burnett_Dickinson Another grave is that of Linley Moreton Phillips, an Australian civilian prisoner of war in Ruhleben internment camp from 1914 to 1918, who died on ship returning to Boston.

Hettich, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 453 (1822), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a witness's testimony could not be objected to merely because the witness suffered from \\"fits of derangement\\", as long as the witness was sane when he testified. The case was the last of four successive Supreme Court cases related specifically to the Oliver Evans flour mill patent, and the second such case to be decided on the same day, following Evans v. Eaton. Altogether the Evans patent generated twelve reported decisions from 1807 to 1822, making it \\"one of the most litigated patents in U.S. history\\".Tyler T. Ochoa, Patent and Copyright Term Extension and the Constitution: A Historical Perspective, 49 J. Copyright Soc'y U.S.A. 19, 58 (2001). Because the arguments in the case addressed the same substantive issues of law as in Evans v. Eaton, the opinion in the case dealt only with certain procedural objections that Evans raised against the proceedings in the trial court. In particular, the Supreme Court focused on the trial court's refusal to allow Evans to raise the question of whether one of the defendant's witnesses was subject to fits of derangement. The case is among several from the Marshall Court in which, when ruling on questions of evidence law, the Court \\"[wrote] magisterial opinions that cited no authority at all.\\"Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Law and Equity: Caselaw and Rules of Civil Procedure, 21 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. ¬ß 5002 (2d ed.). Background Evans' automated flour mill. In the 1780s, inventor Oliver Evans developed a system for an automated flour mill that would revolutionize milling technology. After keeping his invention a secret while he reduced it to practice, he initially obtained protection for it through individual state statutes, for example in Maryland and New Hampshire, because the patent system did not yet exist. When the Patent Act of 1790 took effect, Evans obtained the third United States patent ever issued. No copies of this original patent are extant. As all patents at the time had 14-year terms, his patent lapsed in 1804, and the invention entered the public domain. Immediately upon the expiration of his patent, he sought a private bill that would allow him to renew it, the first such request ever made. He was unsuccessful until 1808 when the Tenth Congress passed a law authorizing the Secretary of State to grant him a new patent on the same terms as the original one.\\"An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans\\", 6 Stat. 70. Evans obtained his new patent the day after the law took effect.Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 872 (C.C.D. Va. 1813). In Evans v. Jordan, 13 U.S. 199 (1815), the Supreme Court ruled that millers who had installed Evans' invention after the expiration of the original patent but before it was reinstated were liable for infringement if they continued to use the technology.Edward C. Walterscheid, Patents and the Jeffersonian Mythology, 29 J. Marshall L. Rev. 269, 302-03 (1995). This led to a national firestorm of litigation and controversy between Evans and numerous millers, of which this case and Evans v. Eaton were two examples. In the district court for Pennsylvania, the defendant Hettich claimed that he did not use Evans' hopperboy, but instead used the earlier Stouffer hopperboy. The trial was presided over by Justice Bushrod Washington, who had a history of hostility to Evans' patent litigation. Persuaded that the patent could only cover the improved method as a whole, rather than any of the improved machines, Justice Washington instructed the jury in such a way that the jurors had no choice but to return a verdict for the defendant, as they did. Evans then appealed to the Supreme Court on a writ of error. He alleged the same substantive errors as in Evans v. Eaton, and also alleged procedural errors in admitting and refusing to admit certain testimony. Evans died two years before the Supreme Court ruled on either this case or his second appeal in Evans v. Eaton. Opinion of the Court Justice Joseph Story wrote for the court majority. No dissenting opinion is recorded. Since the questions of substantive patent law had been dealt with in Evans v. Eaton (1822), Justice Story confined himself to Evans' procedural objections. Evans' first objection, that the trial court had improperly admitted the testimony of a witness who would benefit from the patent being invalidated, was rejected on the same grounds as in Evans v. Eaton, namely, that simply having a stake in the underlying legal issue was not enough to disqualify a witness.20 U.S. at 468-469. Justice Story also upheld Justice Washington's decision to bar questions regarding whether Daniel Stouffer (the inventor of the Stouffer hopperboy) had paid Evans for a license since Stouffer was not on trial.20 U.S. at 470. He additionally upheld the decision to refuse to allow Evans to object to an affidavit submitted by the defendant, on the same grounds that the court had subsequently allowed the defendant to challenge an affidavit submitted by Evans because Evans had already allowed the affidavit to be entered into evidence. On the final objection, that the trial court had improperly prevented Evans from asking whether Stouffer (who may or may not have been a witness) was subject to \\"fits of derangement\\", Justice Story made the one widely cited pronouncement in the case: > [T]he question was properly overruled, because a person is subject to fits > of derangement, is no objection either to his competency or credibility if > he is sane at the time of giving his testimony.  Subsequent developments  Evans v. Hettich has been cited by only one subsequent Supreme Court opinion, in the 1850 case of Grove v. Brien.49 U.S. 429, 437, 12 L. Ed. 1142 (1850).

The plot is an adaptation of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare and requires fore-knowledge of the plot in order to understand the condensed one reel work. The film focuses on the conflict arising from two Kings, one of Bohemia and one of Sicilia, during a meeting. Queen Hermione enrages her jealous husband, Leontes, by entertaining Polixenes. Leontes decides to kill him with poison, but the plan is foiled by the courtier tasked with the assassination. For this, Leontes imprisons his wife. Hermione gives birth to a daughter and Leontes orders the baby to die out in the wilderness. Hermione is then brought before the court and apparently dies after interrogation. Fifteen years pass and Polixenes confronts and then secretly follows his son, appearing as he declares his intention to marry a shepherdess. The two lovers seek protection with Leontes, the King of Sicilia. Mourning and repentant for his past actions, Leontes learns the shepherdess is his daughter and blesses the marriage of the lovers. The royal party goes to see a statue of the late queen Hermoine which is revealed to be alive. The cast includes Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Martin Faust, but the directorial and production credits for the film are unknown. The production was a success for the Thanhouser Company and the film was met with positive reception following its May 27, 1910 release. The film survives in the Library of Congress, but it is missing the final scene of the production. The surviving print suffers from significant deterioration.  Plot  The film is a shortened single reel adaption of the play The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare. The film opens with the meeting of the kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier slips the poison into the cup, but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to be taken out to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and is pronounced dead by Paulina. In a departure from the play, the film shows Hermoine's revival and departure to Paulina's house to dwell in seclusion. The infant princess is raised up by a shepherd of Bohemia. After a time lapse of 15 years, Polixenes confronts his son over his wanderings. He refuses to answer and the king follows him in secret. The prince, disguised as a shepherd, woos the young shepherdess and announces his intention to marry her. The king arrives and forbids it, but a faithful courtier advises them to seek protection of the king of Sicilia. Leontes has long mourned and come to regret his past actions. There, the identity that the shepherdess as his daughter is revealed and the marriage is approved. The royal party is invited to Paulina's house to view a statue of the late queen Hermoine. At the party, Hermoine disguised as a statue, extend her hand and surprises the grieving Leontes, who then rejoices.  Cast  *Anna Rosemond as the Queen of Sicilia *Martin Faust as the King of Sicilia *Frank H. Crane as the King of Bohemia *Amelia Barleon as the Princess of Sicilia *Alfred Hanlon as the Prince of Bohemia  Production  The adaptation of the scenario is credited to Lloyd F. Lonergan and Gertrude Thanhouser. While the director of the film is not known, two directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two- reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The Thanhouser adaption notably foregoes the famous Shakespearean stage directions: Exit, pursued by a bear. and allows Antigonus a peaceful exit. Another difference in the production is that following the collapse and reported death of Hermione. In the play, the audience is aligns with Leontes' view and gives no reason to doubt Hermione's death, but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione's revival and departure. Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time, the role is performed by an inter-title. The final scene is missing from the surviving print.  Release and reception  The one reel drama, approximately 1000 feet long, was released on May 27, 1910. The surviving fragment in the Library of Congress is 12 minutes 35 seconds long, but it does not include the final scene with the disguised Queen of Sicilia. The surviving fragment has suffered significant damage due to deterioration. The film was re-released by the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation with a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher. The film was positively reviewed by the contemporary trade publications that garnered almost universal acclaim. The Moving Picture News stated that this was the first Shakespeare adaptation by an Independent producer and said, \\"We were asked to inspect and criticize this film, and there was nothing for us to do but give our full approval and applause, which we do right heartily.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying \\"Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory.\\" A modern review was given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and highlights the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that it seems as if he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.

It was once a community for children and senior citizens, including a farm. It is now the site of several organizations that support the community and provides housing to a limited number of senior citizens and homeless families. History Winfield Scott Stratton, a wealthy gold mine owner and philanthropist, left money in his will to establish the Myron Stratton Home, named for his father. Stratton stipulated that it became \\"a free home for poor persons who are without means of support and who are physically unable by reason of old age, youth, sickness or other infirmity to earn a livelihood.\\" Stratton died on September 15, 1902 with a $6 million () estate. He left some money to family members, including $50,000 () to Isaac Harry Stratton, a son he did not acknowledge during his lifetime. Most of the money was left to open the establishment where poor people could receive food, medical care, and housing. Lawsuits, though, stripped some of the fortune. Isaac Stratton settled for $350,000 (). A total of $28 million () in claims were made against the estate, including former employees and partners, women who said they were his wife, and the state. After seven years, most of the claims were denied and the estate was intact. Construction began in 1909 on a complex \\"more like a college campus than a poor house\\". It had residence halls, cottages, landscaped grounds, a power plant, and a farm. The Myron Stratton Home, administered by a board of trustees, opened in 1913. Its residents were to be individuals who were U.S. citizens, residents of El Paso County, and who were not \\"by reason of disease, insanity, gross indecency or immorality unfit to associate with worthy persons\\". The first residents were senior citizens, then children who parents could not afford to support, unwanted children, and orphans. Children lived apart from the elderly, and played and worked on the grounds. When her father died and her mother could not afford to raise her, Edith Ryan Sampson lived at the home from 1919 to 1925. She said that it was \\"a place where play and work were equal, with kind instructors who never spanked them.\\" She found it to be a \\"wonderful place\\" where children learned to share and cooperate with others. Children could learn music, drama, dance, and sewing at the home. Until 1979, when foster care was more prevalent, about 7,000 children lived at Myron Stratton Home. The Devereux Cleo Wallace Center operated a program for troubled children on the grounds until 2004. The trustees decided in 1991 that senior housing was no longer needed because of the number of other programs and could not be afforded. After a trial by residents, it was ruled that the home should remain open. Existing residents could stay for free. Anyone that came to live at the home thereafter would make payments toward their expenses. Overview On campus housing is provided to seniors and a dozen homeless families with children. Organizations on the campus include: * Peak Vista Community Health Centers‚Äîa medical clinic for Myron Stratton Home and nearby residents. * Partners in Housing‚ÄîAn agency to assist homeless families and a 12-unit complex for families of single mothers. * TESSA‚Äîdomestic violence support organization.

Contraindications  People should not be taking dasabuvir if they meet any of the following criteria: * They have a hypersensitivity to it or any of the substances in the tablet. * They are taking any hormonal contraception that contain ethinylestradiol (often found in combined oral contraceptives or vaginal rings). * They are also taking medications that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, mitotane, rifampicin, enzalutamide, and St. John's Wort (Hypercium perforatum). * They are also taking medications that are strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (gemfibrozil). * They meet contraindication criteria for ombitasivir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir since dasabuvir is used in combination with those three medications. In October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the manufacturer to add a warning to the drug label that hepatitis C treatments Viekira Pak and Technivie can cause serious liver injury mostly in people with underlying advanced liver disease.  Adverse effects  The FDA approved combination of dasabuvir used with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir in the product Viekira Pak can cause a number of adverse effects. When Viekira Pak was used without ribavirin, nausea, severe itching, and insomnia occurred in more than 5% of the subjects. Less commonly, patients experienced increases in liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, to greater than five times the upper limit of normal (occurred in 1% of patients). Usually this was asymptomatic. However, this is notable because females who are taking ethinylestradiol are at an increased risk for this side effect (25%). Dasabuvir could cause hepatitis B re-activation in people co- infected with hepatitis B and C viruses. The European Medicines Agency recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting dasabuvir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation.  Mechanism of action  Dasabuvir works by inhibiting the action of NS5B palm polymerase, effectively terminating RNA polymerization and stopping the replication of the HCV's genome. By blocking NS5B polymerase, the virus can no longer multiply and infect new cells.  History  The U.S. FDA approved regimen of ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir and dasabuvir on December 19, 2014, to be used in the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection in adults, which includes those with compensated cirrhosis.  Administration and storage  The two tablets of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir will be taken in the morning and the one dasabuvir tablet taken twice a day in the morning and in the evening with a meal. The combination pack is packaged in a monthly package for 28 days of treatment.

He is best known from his engravings, many made after other artists including Pietro da Cortona, Annibale Carraci, and other masters. He painted several altarpieces and frescoes in Sansepolcro, including two frescos on the Life of the Virgin for the church of Santa Chiara, and an altar-piece in San Lorenzo.

The 17 February 1895 is recorded in the history as the debut of the first Lithuanian choir. The concert was held to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Lithuanian Birutƒó Society. On 2 December 1895 the Tilsit Lithuanian Singers‚Äô Community was founded led by Vyd≈´nas (Vilius Storosta). The community used to organise theatre performances, concerts, evenings, St. John‚Äôs Day festivities in Tilsit, Klaipƒóda, Gumbinƒó, Verdainƒó, Rusnƒó, Ragainƒó, Juodkrantƒó, Smalininkai. Up to one thousand spectators used to gather at the events, the so called the winter and summer Lithuanian celebrations, which later in 1902 were re-titled as the Song Celebrations. On 6 June 1927, the first Lithuanian Song Festival of Klaipƒóda Region took place. 12 choirs comprising 800 singers and 100 orchestra took part in the event. The joint choir was conducted by Antanas Vaiƒçi≈´nas and Vyd≈´nas. In 1928, the Second Song Festival of Klaipƒóda was organized in ≈†ilutƒó. =In interwar Lithuania= The first song festival in the Interwar Lithuania was held on 23-25 August 1924 in Petras Vilei≈°is Square, Kaunas, during the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition. The festival's initiator was Juozas ≈Ωileviƒçius, with chief conductors Juozas Naujalis, Stasys ≈†imkus and Julius ≈†tarka. The choirs conductor was Kostas Gureviƒçius, Mykolas Karka, Apolinaras Likerauskas, Vladas Paulauskas and Antanas Vaiƒçi≈´nas. 77 choirs participated, comprising 3,000 singers, attracting 50,000 spectators. Since then, the song festival became a tradition in Lithuania. The Second Lithuanian Song Festival was dedicated to the 10th anniversary of Lithuania's Independence, and took place in 1-2 July 1928 in Kaunas. The appearances included 51 church choirs, 22 choirs of gymnasia and other schools, 19 choirs of various associations and organizations, and the choir of the Riga's Lithuanian \\"Lights\\" (headed by Juozas Karosas), featuring 6,000 singers.

They were accompanied by a choir that was singing popular folk songs. The Second Song Festival was attended by about 100,000 spectators. The third song festival was held on 20 June 1930 and was dedicated to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Vytautas the Great's death. About 200 choirs and 9,000 singers participated in the event. The event performed 24 pieces - one psalm, six original pieces and a number of harmonized folk songs. The chief conductors was Juozas Naujalis, Nikodemas Martinonis, and Juozas Gruodis. The first folklore dance festival is held on 29 October 1937. A celebration was organized in Kaunas by the Lithuania Youth. 448 dancers from different regions of Lithuania performed a number of national folklore dances. Between 1920 and 1944, a number of regional, city and other local song festivals were held, organized by various public organizations. Since 1930 some regional song and sport festivals were held for schoolchildren. =In Lithuanian SSR= The tradition of song festivals was continued during the Soviet occupation. In 1946, 188 choirs with 11,778 singers participated in the song festival, and performed songs composed by 15 composers and included 15 Lithuanian harmonized songs. The chief Conductors for the 1946 edition were Nikodemas Martinonis, Jonas ≈†vedas, Konradas Kaveckas and Antanas Ilƒçiukas. From 1950 on, the National Dance Day was added to the Song Festival. The festival was attended by 57 dance groups, 41 ensembles and 13 concert bands. Since 1950, the song and dance festival events were organized periodically every 5 years. The tradition of song and dance festivals, like other arts, contained the dogma of Soviet aesthetics and politics, and Lithuanian art was supposed to be a form of nationalism, but with socialist content. The Vingis Park Amphitheater was opened in time for the 1960 edition of the festival. The amphitheater was based on a modified design of the Estonian Song Festival Grounds in Tallinn. The Youth Song Festival has sprung up from the song and dance festival tradition. It became popular and became an independent event, held periodically since 1964. =Lithuanian diaspora= Lithuanian diasporas also held the song festivals. The first Lithuanian diaspora song festival was organized in W√ºrzburg, Germany, on 1956. The festivals was also held by Lithuanians living abroad (especially on the United States and Canada), and was held every five years. =Since 1990= After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the Lithuanian Song Festival reverted to its traditional identity and gained the status of a national tradition.

Early life Mahon and his siblings thus grew up in England. He was educated at Marlborough College and Exeter College, Oxford, where he obtained a degree in law in 1884. He opened practice in Dublin, but was not satisfied with his chosen profession. Career The Mahon clan had been influential in Anglo-Irish politics, but the real impetus to greater fame was provided by John Ross Mahon (1814‚Äì1887),Duffy, Peter; The Killing of Major Denis Mahon; Harper Collins, 2008 Sir William's younger brother. He was a very successful land agent and founding partner in Guinness Mahon, a merchant bank. When he died a bachelor in 1887, his very substantial personal wealth as well as his interest in the bank passed on to his prot√©g√©, John FitzGerald Mahon (1858‚Äì1942), an older brother of Edward. Following an exploratory world trip, John settled on the Vancouver area of British Columbia as a suitable place for investment, and delegated Edward to look after his business interests there. Edward arrived in October 1890, and soon gravitated to the opportunities for growth on the north shore of Burrard Inlet, as well mining opportunities in the West Kootenay region. Investments In 1891, he purchased a pre-emption from Albert McCleary near the confluence of the Columbia and Kootenay rivers, and on it, platted a town-site that he named Castlegar, in honour of his ancestral home in Ireland. He sought out a partnership for its development with Augustus Heinze, who was in 1897 constructing his Columbia & Western Railway northward from his Trail smelter operation. Edward's plans for a showcase Kootenay city collapsed when Heinze sold out all his interests to the CPR early in 1898, and the railway effectively blocked the development of his city in favour of Nelson. Heinze retreated to his operational base in Butte, Montana, and later New York, where he was instrumental in precipitating the financial Panic of 1907.McNellis, Sarah; Copper King at War: The Biography of F. Augustus Heinze; University of Montana Press, 1968 Edward‚Äôs most profitable investment in the West Kootenay was with his early acquisition of the Vancouver Group of mining claims near Silverton. By the mid-1890s he was joined in the mining ventures by his younger brother Gilbert Mahon (1865‚Äì1947), with John FitzGerald Mahon occasionally participating as well. By 1898 Edward‚Äôs interests had shifted fully to what would become the North Vancouver city and district. He was now living in a new house, built on the corner of Burrard and Hastings streets in Vancouver. It became a social centre of Vancouver, and served Edward for thirty years before it was demolished in 1929 to make room for the Marine Building. During this period Edward was involved in many enterprises which marketed real estate, promoted development, provided financing, and managed properties for absentee landowners. His associations included: the North Vancouver Land & Improvement Company; Mahon, McFarland & Mahon; ownership of forested lands in the Capilano valley as well as the Capilano Suspension Bridge;Dempster, Eleanore; The Laughing Bridge: A Personal History of the Capilano Suspension Bridge; Impressions in Print Enterprises, 2004 development of the West Lake ski area on Hollyburn Ridge, and support of plans for an astronomical telescope for Grouse Mountain. Personal life He married Lilette Rebbeck (1889‚Äì1956) in 1911; she was 28 years junior and very talented artistically, being an early student of Emily Carr, and a later mover in the Art in Living movement, which brought her into close association with C. E. (Ned) Pratt, B. C. Binning, Charles H. Scott, Fred Amess, and Jack Shadbolt. The couple had one son, Bryan (1913‚Äì2005), who was attracted to aviation at an early age, and pursued a distinguished career with Boeing Aviation in Seattle. This mirrored the family situation of his patron brother John FitzGerald, whose only son Denis Mahon (1910‚Äì2011) turned his back on his father's banking enterprise to become an authority on Italian Baroque art and a generous supporter of the Art Fund. Edward died in 1937, having lost much of his fortune in the stock market collapse and the Great Depression that followed.Volovsek, Walter O.; Edward Mahon ‚Äì A Talented Visionary; BC History, Winter 2013.
