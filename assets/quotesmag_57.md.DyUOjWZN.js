It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Leyland, the archdeaconry of Blackburn and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1836‚Äì37 to a Romanesque design by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. It was one of Sharpe's first commissions and one of his early churches in Romanesque style. The plan for the church was signed on 9 May 1836 by Sharpe, its estimated cost being ¬£1,360 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The church was paid for mainly by public subscription. The foundation stone was laid on 28 July 1836 by Robert Townley Parker of Cuerdon Hall, who gave the land for the church. Townley Parker also gave ¬£200 towards the cost of the church. As first built, it contained 450 seats. It was consecrated on 3 October 1837 by the Bishop of Chester. In 1886, the chancel and transepts were added in a similar style by Thomas Harrison Myres. The foundation stone for this extension was laid on 17 July 1886, and the church was re-consecrated on 10 February 1887 by the Bishop of Manchester. Architecture St Saviour's is constructed in local sandstone, with a Welsh slate roof and red ridge tiles. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with transepts, and a chancel with a semicircular apse. At the west end is a tower consisting of a two-stage square base, a two-stage octagonal drum and a spire. Internally is a gallery supported on cast iron columns, decorated with the Royal coat of arms. On the walls are monuments to the Townley Parker family. The font dates from the early 20th century and consists of an octagonal bowl supported by angels and a bronze cover with a figure of St John the Baptist. The two-manual organ was built in 1889 by Alexander Young.

Family and early life Charlotte, ca. 1853. Alexandrine ('Addy') was the youngest child born to Prince Albert of Prussia and his wife Princess Marianne of the Netherlands. She was named after her aunt (and later mother-in-law) the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She had two elder surviving siblings, Princess Charlotte (later Hereditary Princess of Saxe- Meiningen), and Prince Albert. Her parents' marriage was dissolved on 28 March 1849. Her father later remarried in 1853 to one of the court maids-of-honor, Rosalie von Rauch, who was created Countess of Hohenau. The couple had two sons. Their mother also remarried morganatically to a former coachman, producing issue with Johannes van Rossum. Due to the troubled marriage of her parents, Alexandrine was to all intents and purposes the adopted daughter of her otherwise childless uncle and aunt, King Frederick William IV of Prussia and Queen Elisabeth Ludovika, and became their ward. They took Alexandrine to live with them, bringing her up as their own offspring. Marriage=Marriage prospects As a young woman, Alexandrine was considered as a potential bride for the one-year older Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom), but was not considered \\"clever or pretty\\" enough by his sister Crown Princess Victoria ('Vicky') of Prussia. The prince married Alexandra of Denmark instead. Despite her comment, Vicky had a fondness for Alexandrine, writing to her mother that she was \\"such an excellent girl and much admired here\\". There were also financial advantages to a marriage to Alexandrine; she already had one million dollars through her mother, and would have even more wealth when she married. Consequently, Vicky tried again to marry her off to another British relative, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge. Nothing came of this either, however. Wedding Alexandrine's husband Duke William. On 9 December 1865, Alexandrine married her much-older cousin Duke William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1827‚Äì1879). He was a younger son of Paul Frederick, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg and Alexandrine's aunt and namesake Princess Alexandrine of Prussia. Though the marriage was meant to give her financial security in the future, it was certainly not a love match; Alexandrine cried during the entire wedding ceremony. Vicky described the wedding to her mother, > \\"The wedding was celebrated with the greatest pomp, but had something of the > solemnity of a funeral about it ‚Äì nothing gay, festive or bridal. The only > thing that made a pleasing impression on me was dear Addy herself, who > although she cried the whole time, had such a dignified and touching > appearance that I never saw her look so well. She went through it all with > the most perfect tenue ‚Äì though I never saw her smile once. She did not look > a bit like a bride but I must say very elegant and distinguee... The > bridegroom's tenance looked as evil as possible the whole time. I looked in > vain for a trace of softness of feeling\\". Furthermore, William had a reputation for drunkenness and a dissolute character, so it was surprising that the exceedingly pious and recently widowed Queen Elisabeth gave her consent to the match. On two occasions William had been deprived of his command in the Prussian army and had recently proposed marriage to the celebrated ballerina Marie Taglioni; consequently he was generally considered to be the \\"black sheep\\" of the family. Regardless, the Queen granted her permission, endowing her with a grand trousseau of lavish clothing and jewelry. Her other uncle Emperor Wilhelm I gave her an opulent diamond necklace, while her mother Princess Marianne gave her a necklace of Siberian amethysts as well as an emerald diadem. Marriage and later life William's older brother Frederick Francis already had many children from his two marriages, so there was no chance of William and Alexandrine succeeding to the throne of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. During their marriage, the couple lived at Bellevue Palace in Berlin; Alexandrine saw little of Mecklenburg, her husband's native country. The marriage was unhappy, and she tried to escape several times, only to be forced back by pressure from her powerful Aunt Alexandrine. William managed with difficulty to secure an unimportant command in the Prussian army during the Franco-Prussian War. He was badly injured from an explosion during the war, but continued to live on until 1879. The couple had one surviving daughter: * Duchess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (7 November 1868 ‚Äì 20 December 1944); married Prince Heinrich XVIII Reuss of K√∂stritz and had issue. After her husband's death, Alexandrine dedicated her life to her daughter, and played very little part in public life. Alexandrine died on 26 March 1906 at Schloss Marley, near Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany. Bellevue Palace was next occupied by Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia and his new bride Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg.

It is a work in 74 verses describing methods for the computation of the true positions of the Moon at intervals of about half an hour for various days in an anomalistic cycle. This work is an elaboration of an earlier and shorter work of MƒÅdhava himself titled SphutacandrƒÅpti. Ve·πávƒÅroha is the most popular astronomical work of MƒÅdhava. It is dated 1403 CE. Acyuta Pi·π£ƒÅrati (1550‚Äì1621), another prominent mathematician/astronomer of the Kerala school, has composed a Malayalam commentary on Ve·πávƒÅroha. This astronomical treatise is of a type generally described as Kara·πáa texts in India. Such works are characterized by the fact that they are compilations of computational methods of practical astronomy. The title Ve·πávƒÅroha literally means Bamboo Climbing and it is indicative of the computational procedure expounded in the text. The computational scheme is like climbing a bamboo tree, going up and up step by step at measured equal heights. The novelty and ingenuity of the method attracted the attention of several of the followers of MƒÅdhava and they composed similar texts thereby creating a genre of works in Indian mathematical tradition collectively referred to as ‚Äòve·πávƒÅroha texts‚Äô. These include Drik-ve·πávƒÅrohakriya of unknown authorship of epoch 1695 and Ve·πávƒÅrohastaka of Putuman SomƒÅyaji. In the technical terminology of astronomy, the ingenuity introduced by MƒÅdhava in Ve·πávƒÅroha can be explained thus: MƒÅdhava has endeavored to compute the true longitude of the Moon by making use of the true motions rather than the epicyclic astronomy of the Aryabhata tradition. He made use of the anomalistic revolutions for computing the true positions of the Moon using the successive true daily velocity specified in CandravƒÅkyas (Table of Moon-mnemonics) for easy memorization and use. Ve·πávƒÅroha has been studied from a modern perspective and the process is explained using the properties of periodic functions.

Superstition Mountains as seen from the trails of Lost Dutchman State Park in Arizona, USA Lost Dutchman State Park is a state park located near the Superstition Mountains in central Arizona, USA, and named after the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine, a famous gold mine legendary among the tales of the Old West. It is accessible about east of Phoenix via U.S. Highway 60, the Superstition Freeway. History The area was first developed as a day use recreation area by the Bureau of Land Management in 1972. The abutting the Tonto National Forest was transferred in 1977 via legislative action to the state of Arizona, creating the Lost Dutchman State Park.History of Lost Dutchman State Park Retrieved 30 March 2015 The park was expanded to in 1983. Features The park offers camping facilities, day use parking and acts as a trailhead for the trails leading into the Tonto National Forest in which the Superstition Mountains are located. Some of the most popular walks are from the park onto the National Forest Service trails that lead across the western face of the Superstitions (Jacob's Crosscut trail) and up the face of this edge using Siphon Draw trail. Many people confuse these National Forest trails with trails that are maintained by Lost Dutchman State Park. Siphon Draw and Superstition Ridgeline Trail=Siphon Draw to Flatiron Siphon Draw is a popular trail, and leads to the iconic \\"Flatiron\\" which looks like a ship's bow jutting out of the side of the mountain range. The last mile of hiking up to the Flatiron is a steep boulder scramble. The land is classed as in maintained wilderness area and does not offer trail signs or markers. The last of the trail to the Flatiron are a class four scramble called 'The Wall'. Park Rangers recommend gloves. The last mile is not suitable for hiking with dogs. Superstition Ridgeline Flatiron to Peralta Trailhead The trail continues along the ridge to Peralta Trailhead about away. The section of the trail from Lost Dutchman State Park to the Basin, half way up, is well marked and popular, and required route finding skills are minimal. The last mile up to the Flatiron at the top of the ridge is unmarked wilderness area. From the Flatiron along the top of the ridge to Peralta Trailhead, the trail is much less obvious as it gets much less traffic, marked only by cairns. This area is extremely remote and can be accessed only the trailheads at each end. Hog Canyon or Hieroglyphics Canyon provide possible escape routes in case of emergency, but these trails are more rugged and require more advanced route finding skill than the ridgeline itself. Because of the remote and difficult nature of these canyons, hikers should prepare to finish the entire hike and bring emergency gear with them. This hike should not be attempted in summer. There is no water along the route, and little shade, and the amount of water that must be consumed may exceed the carrying capacity of even the strongest hikers. Even in winter or shoulder season, each hiker should carry between one and two gallons of pure water. The ridgeline has a net elevation gain of about from the lowest point at Siphon Draw Trail head at to the highest point as it skirts Superstition Peak at about . However, the accumulated elevation gain is about more than Bright Angel Trail in the Grand Canyon. Furthermore, Bright Angel Trail has water available from potable water stations, and from proximity to Bright Angel Creek and the Colorado River, while the Superstition Ridgeline does not have water. Proposed closure averted The park was scheduled to close on June 3, 2010. A man from Katy, Texas donated $8,000 so the park could stay open.

The clock dial is above the main gates to Red Square. For decades, the chimes have rung on the quarter-hour, with bells tolling for each full hour. Translating History: 30 Years on the Front Lines of Diplomacy (20th century), Igor Korchilov, 1999, 400 pages, p. 166, web: GB-Gk.  Old clock  According to various historical accounts from a corresponding article on Russian Wikipedia, the clock on the Spasskaya Tower was built between 1491 and 1585. In 1585, clocks were in use at three of the Kremlin's gates, Spasskaya, Taynitskaya and Troitskaya Towers, exemplifying the use of clocks as early as the 16th century. There are mentions from 1613-1614 of a clock at the Nikolskaya Tower as well. In 1614 the clock at the Frolovskaya Tower was maintained by Nikiforka Nikitin. In September 1624 some old wartime clocks were sold to the Yaroslavl' Jesus Transfiguration Monastery. In 1625, under the leadership of Scottish engineer and clockmaker Christopher Galloway, the Russian clockmakers Zhdan, his son Shumilo Zhdanov, and his grandson Alexey Shumilov completed the new clock. The thirteen bells for the clock mechanism were cast by the blacksmith Cyril Samoilov. The clocks were burned down in the fire of 1626, but they were later restored by Galloway. In 1668 the clocks underwent a refit to \\"play music\\" on the hour, at sunrise, and at sunset, using special mechanisms. The 24-hour dial was numbered using Cyrillic numerals. The characters were about tall (one arshin), cast in brass and covered with gold leaf. The clock featured an image of the sun in the middle of the dial, with its hour-hand in the form of an elongated beam of light. The solar image was suspended from the upper portion of the clock face, which was divided into 17 equal parts, corresponding to the 17 hours of daylight in Moscow on the longest day of the year, the summer solstice.  History  In 1706, a new clock was installed. It was purchased by Peter the Great, in Holland, transported from Amsterdam to Moscow in 30 wagons, and installed by watchmaker Ekim Garnov. It had a 12-hour dial on the clock face. The new clock served, with some interruptions, until the middle of 19th century. It was damaged by fire in 1737 and was not restored until 1767. From 1770, it played the German melody \\"Oh, you dear Augustin\\". During the Moscow fire of 1812 the clock was again damaged. The modern Kremlin Clock was remodeled in 1851, by the Butenop brothers in Moscow.–∫—Ç–æ –∏–∑–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏–ª –ö—Ä–µ–º–ª—ë–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫—É—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—ã otvet.mail.ru For more melodious ringing tones, 24 bells were removed from the Trinity and Borovitskaya Towers and moved to the Spasskaya Tower. Most of the restoration work on the tower itself was done at the same time under the direction of the architect Gerasimov. The metal floors, stairs, and clock pedestal were made according to drawings by Russian architect Konstantin Thon, the designer of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. From then on, the chimes played the \\"March of the Preobrazhensky regiment\\" at 12 and 6 o'clock, while at 3 and 9 o'clock it played the anthem \\"How Glorious is Our Lord in Zion\\" by Dmitry Bortniansky. Initially, the national anthem \\"God Save The Tsar!\\" was proposed, but Tsar Nicholas I forbade it, stating that \\"the chimes can play any song except for the anthem\\". In 1913, for the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty, a new restoration of the clock was carried out. On 2 November 1917, during the storming of the Kremlin by the Bolsheviks, the clock was hit by a shell and stopped. History of the Civil War in the U. S. S. R., Maxim Gorky, Academic International Press, 1975 BG-s6. One of the hands was broken and the mechanism controlling the rotation of the hands was damaged. The clock stopped for nearly a year. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1918, at the direction of Lenin, the clock was repaired by watchmaker N. Behrens. With great difficulty, a new pendulum was made of gold-plated lead. At the direction of the new government, artist and musician Mikhail Cheremnykh was commissioned to compose new revolutionary music for the clock to play. It played the Internationale at noon and \\"You Fell A Victim\\" at midnight. In 1932 the Kremlin Clock was again restored. A new face was installed, an exact copy of the original. The rim, numbers and hands were covered with gold (28 kg of gold in all). The use of the Internationale was the only thing left unchanged. However, from 1938 the chimes were silent and played no tunes. The clock simply struck the hours and quarter-hours, as a Special Commission recognized that the sound of the musical chimes had become unsatisfactory, because the chime mechanism was worn and seasonal frosts had severely distorted the sound. The clock of the Moscow Kremlin rings in 2012. The melody heard before the striking is played alone once on the first quarter-hour, twice on the half-hour, and three times on the third quarter-hour. The phrase is played four times on the full hour, followed by the strikes. After the strikes, sometimes an additional tune is played; usually a short phrase from the national anthem. In 1941, specifically for a performance of the Internationale, a special electromechanical drive was installed and later dismantled. In 1944, at the direction of Joseph Stalin, unsuccessful attempts were made to reset the clock to play the new National Anthem of the Soviet Union. Major restoration of the chimes and the entire clock mechanism was carried out in 1974. The mechanism was stopped for 100 days, completely disassembled, and restored, replacing some old parts. However, the mechanism of the musical bells remained unrestored. In 1991 the Plenum of the Central Committee decided to resume work on the Kremlin chimes, but it turned out that they were three bells short of what was needed for the Soviet national anthem. This problem arose again in 1995. \\"Patriotic Song\\" by Mikhail Glinka was adopted as the new national anthem. In 1996, during the inauguration of Boris Yeltsin, the Kremlin clock played a tune once more, after 58 years of silence. In the absence of a few bells needed to perform the national anthem, metal beats were installed in addition to the bells. At noon and midnight, the chimes played \\"Patriotic Song\\", while at every three hours, they played the melody of the chorus \\"Glory, Glory to you, holy Rus'!\\" from the opera A Life for the Tsar (also by Glinka). The last major restoration was carried out in 1999 after six months' planning. The hands and numbers were re- gilded. Instead of \\"Patriotic Song\\", the chimes played the new National Anthem of Russia that had been approved in 2000.  Technical parameters  The Kremlin clock faces have a diameter of and are placed on all four sides of the Spasskaya tower. The Roman numerals are tall. The length of the hour hand is , and of the minute hand . The total weight of clock and bells is 25 tons. The mechanism is powered by 3 weights, weighing between . Accuracy is achieved by a pendulum weighing . Transfer from winter to summer time was done manually. The chimes consist of bells located at the top of the tower, right above the clock. Chimes The melody heard before the striking is played alone once on the first quarter-hour, twice on the half-hour, and three times on the third quarter-hour. The phrase is played four times on the full hour, followed by the strikes Usually, an additional tune is played after the main melody and the strikes, normally every three hours. The melody is believed to be known as \\"Malinovsky chimes\\". At noon, midnight, 6 am and 6 pm the chimes play a short excerpt from the national anthem after the hour strikes, while at 3 am, 9 am, 3 pm and 9 pm it plays the melody of the \\"Glory\\" chorus from Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar. The clock is set twice a day. The original clock was wound by hand, but from 1937, it was done using three electric motors. Prior to the adoption of State Anthem of the Russian Federation in 2000, the chimes played an excerpt of Patrioticheskaya Pesnya throughout the 1990s.

Dieminger's research was focused on the ionosphere. Life and work Dieminger studied physics between 1926 and 1935 at the Technical University of Munich. After receiving his Ph.D. for work on electromagnetic waves and the ionosphere with Jonathan Zenneck, he worked at the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt (German Experimental Institute for Aviation). With his focus on research of the ionosphere and electromagnetic waves at his new institute, called the Zentralstelle f√ºr Funkberatung (Central Counseling Office for Radio Communication). Applying a code invented by his cooperator Karl Rawer he was able to make predictions on shortwave communication for the military and the police. The institute at Leobersdorf continued to monitor the ionosphere until the end of World War II. A group of British physicists supervised the dissolution of the institute. The ionospheric physicist William Roy Piggott opposed the dissolution and managed to transfer most of its scientists and equipment to Lindau am Harz in the British sector of Germany. This research institute became later, after several name changes, the Max Planck Institute for Ionospheric Research in 1948. Dieminger became the director of the institute in 1951, which was renamed the Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy in 1958. He continued his research of the upper atmosphere and was able to participate in several international collaborations. For example, he established a station for ionospheric observations in Tsumeb, Namibia and cooperated with the Finnish EISCAT facility in Sodankyl√§.

Microsoft initiated OData in 2007. Versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are released under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise. Version 4.0 was standardized at OASIS, with a release in March 2014. In April 2015 OASIS submitted OData v4 and OData JSON Format v4 to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for approval as an international standard. The protocol enables the creation and consumption of REST APIs, which allow Web clients to publish and edit resources, identified using URLs and defined in a data model, using simple HTTP messages. OData shares some similarities with JDBC and with ODBC; like ODBC, OData is not limited to relational databases.

Architecture OData is a protocol for the creation and consumption of RESTful APIs. Thus, as common practices of REST, OData builds on HTTP, AtomPub, and JSON using URIs to address and access data feed resources. Resource identification OData uses URIs to identify resources. For every OData service whose service root is abbreviated as http://host/service/, the following fixed resources can be found: = The service document = The service document lists entity sets, functions, and singletons that can be retrieved. Clients can use the service document to navigate the model in a hypermedia-driven fashion. The service document is available at http://host/service/. = The metadata document = The metadata document describes the types, sets, functions and actions understood by the OData service. Clients can use the metadata document to understand how to query and interact with entities in the service. The metadata document is available at http://host/service/$metadata. = Dynamic resources = The URIs for the dynamic resources may be computed from the hypermedia information in the service document and metadata document.  Resource operation  OData uses the HTTP verbs to indicate the operations on the resources. * GET: Get the resource (a collection of entities, a single entity, a structural property, a navigation property, a stream, etc.). * POST: Create a new resource. * PUT: Update an existing resource by replacing it with a complete instance. * PATCH: Update an existing resource by replacing part of its properties with a partial instance. * DELETE: Remove the resource.  Resource representation  OData uses different formats for representing data and the data model. In OData protocol version 4.0, JSON format is the standard for representing data, with the Atom format still being in committee specification stage. For representing the data model, the Common Schema Definition Language (CSDL) is used, which defines an XML representation of the entity data model exposed by OData services. = A sample OData JSON data payload = A collection of products: { \\"@odata.context\\": \\"http://services.odata.org/V4/OData/OData.svc/$metadata#Products\\", \\"value\\": [ { \\"ID\\": 0, \\"Name\\": \\"Meat\\", \\"Description\\": \\"Red Meat\\", \\"ReleaseDate\\": \\"1992-01-01T00:00:00Z\\", \\"DiscontinuedDate\\": null, \\"Rating\\": 14, \\"Price\\": 2.5 }, { \\"ID\\": 1, \\"Name\\": \\"Milk\\", \\"Description\\": \\"Low fat milk\\", \\"ReleaseDate\\": \\"1995-10-01T00:00:00Z\\", \\"DiscontinuedDate\\": null, \\"Rating\\": 3, \\"Price\\": 3.5 }, ... ] } = A sample OData Atom data payload = A collection of products: http://services.odata.org/v4/odata/odata.svc/Products Products 2015-05-19T03:38:50Z http://services.odata.org/V4/OData/OData.svc/Products(0) 2015-05-19T03:38:50Z 0 Bread Whole grain bread 1992-01-01T00:00:00Z 4 2.5 http://services.odata.org/V4/OData/OData.svc/Products(1) 2015-05-19T03:38:50Z 1 Milk Low fat milk 1995-10-01T00:00:00Z 3 3.5 ... = A sample OData metadata document Ecosystem The ecosystem of OData consists of the client/server libraries that implement the protocol, and applications that are based on the protocol.

There are only two rugby union clubs within the city of Hull boundary. History The club was formed in 1992 as a result of two clubs ‚Äì Old Hymerians RUFC and Hull & East Riding RUFC (1989). The club initially played at the Old Hymerians ground at Haworth Park (capacity 1,200) until the 2008‚Äì09 season when they moved to their current home; the Ferens Ground located at Chanterlands Avenue. The club has progressed up the rugby union pyramid, beginning life in the old North East 2, and won promotion to National League 2 North in 2009 - which at tier 4 is the highest position the club has reached. In 2009 a women's team was founded at the club and the women and girls section is continuously growing. In 2015, after six seasons in National League 2 North, Hull were relegated back to the northern regional leagues. In 2019 the club won the North Premier (tier 5) league title for the very first time, making a return to National League 2 North. Ground The Ferens Ground is located on Chanterlands Avenue, next to Hull Sports Centre, about 2.5 miles from Hull Paragon Interchange and the city centre, with parking available both in and around the ground. Capacity is around 1,500, most of which is standing but there is also seating for up to 288 supporters.

At Boston Children's Hospital, the average age at diagnosis is 12 years.Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma, Boston Children's Hospital website, http://www.childrenshospital.org/health- topics/conditions/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma usually develops within the supratentorial region (the area of the brain located above the tentorium cerebelli). It is generally located superficially (in the uppermost sections) in the cerebral hemispheres and involves the leptomeninges. It rarely arises from the spinal cord. These tumors are formed through the mitosis of astrocytes. They are found in the area of the temples, in the brain's frontal lobe or on top of the parietal lobe. In about 20% of cases, tumors exist in more than one lobe. Symptoms and signs Children with PXA can present with a variety of symptoms. Complaints may vary, and patients may report symptoms that have been occurring for many months and are often linked with more common diseases. (For example, headaches are a common complaint.) Some children, however, will present with symptoms that start very suddenly, like seizures. Diagnosis PXA as visualized on an MRI PXA is diagnosed through a combination of diagnostic processes: * Initially, a doctor will interview the patient and do a clinical exam, which will include a neurological examination. * A CT scan of the brain, and/or an MRI scan of the brain and spine, will be performed. A special dye may be injected into a vein before these scans to provide contrast and make tumors easier to see. * For children experiencing seizures, an EEG might be part of the diagnostic process (the goal being to record the brain's electrical activity in order to identify and localize seizure activity). * Finally, a biopsy of the tumor, taken through a needle during a simple surgical procedure, helps to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment under a microscope Surgery is often the treatment of choice. Total resection (removal of the tumor) is often possible. However, the best choice of treatment will depend on many individual factors, including: * The patient's medical history and overall health condition * The type, location, and size of the tumor * The patient's age * How well the patient tolerates specific medications, procedures, or therapy * How slowly or quickly the tumor is expected to progress If surgery is performed and the tumor is completely resected, further treatment may not be required. The patient will, however, need repeated MRIs to monitor for tumor re-growth. For tumors that recur, another surgical resection might be attempted. For tumors that could not be completely removed, radiation therapy may also be recommended. Also called radiotherapy, this treatment uses high-energy radiation to damage or kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Effects of treatment on symptoms Symptoms of PXA may disappear, or improve progressively, after treatment. For example: *Symptoms related to increased pressure in the brain often disappear after surgical removal of the tumor. *Effects like seizures might progressively improve as recovery progresses. *Steroid treatment is often used to control tissue swelling that may occur before and after surgery. Side effects of treatmentBrain surgery= Children with PXA may experience seizures as a symptom of their disease. However, any person undergoing brain surgery is at risk of developing epileptic seizures. Medication is administered to minimize or prevent seizure activity. Additionally, after surgery, parents should be informed of the risk of seizures, and educated on what to do in the event of a seizure. With any brain surgery, there is also a risk of brain damage. =Radiation therapy= Radiation therapy may cause swelling in the brain, related to tissue inflammation. This inflammation may lead to symptoms like headaches. It may be treated with oral medication. Prognosis following treatment With treatment, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas are associated with a high rate of cure.Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma, Boston Children's Hospital website, http://www.childrenshospital.org/health-topics/conditions/p/pleomorphic- xanthoastrocytoma/treatments * Grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas are known to progress towards grade II tumors, which are more likely to recur after surgical removal. * Grade III anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas may evolve and show signs of anaplasia, according to evidence in the medical literature. = Response to progressive or recurrent disease = If PXA recurs or gets worse, the recommended course of action is to monitor the disease and reattempt a complete surgical removal, according to the medical literature. In cases of progressive or recurrent disease, or when maximal surgical removal has been achieved, the medical team will consider radiation therapy. Nine medical institutions in the United States have formed a Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, which \\"is dedicated to the development of new and innovative treatments for children with progressive/recurrent brain tumors not responsive to standard therapies. Children with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas would be eligible for a number of experimental therapies available through the consortium.Children's Hospital Boston, http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1454/mainpageS1454P0.html Prognosis Among people with PXA who were able to have their tumors completely resected during surgery, there is a long-term survival rate of 90%. After incomplete resection, the long-term survival rate is higher than 50%. Morbidity is determined by the type and evolution of the tumor, with high- graded anaplastic tumors causing more fatalities.

Set in 1919, it concerns an orphaned girl who becomes involved in an inheritance swindle. Plot summary Rachel Sheridan is the only child of British missionaries working among the Kikuyu and Masai tribes of British East Africa (present-day Kenya). Her father is a doctor and her mother a teacher. Life goes haywire as an influenza epidemic strikes when Rachel is 13, in 1919. Many die from the sickness, including her mother. The Pritchards, arrogant planters who live nearby, bring their daughter Valerie to the hospital, but it is too late to save her. After Rachel's father dies and it looks as if the hospital will be closed, Rachel is taken in by the Pritchards. They persuade the reluctant Rachel to impersonate their daughter, sending her in Valerie's place to visit her dying grandfather in England, on the pretext that it will save his life. Rachel considers telling people of the Pritchards' lies on the ship, but she soon arrives in England and begins to develop a close relationship with her \\"grandfather\\", who, like her, is very fond of birds. Just as things begin to get better, the Pritchards' unveil their new plot, to take the grandfather's property when he dies. In scorn of his son, the grandfather sends them away, but his trusty solicitor, Mr. Grumbloch, gives Rachel his address and tells her to come in an emergency. Rachel comes within the day, and he returns her to her grandfather, telling him the truth, which they have already suspected. There is an epilogue at the end of the novel, in which Rachel becomes his adopted daughter and attends school, later returning to her father's hospital as a doctor. Critical reception The audiobook recording of Listening for Lions received an Audie Award as well as AudioFile magazine's Earphones Award.

Rationale The automation of a business process involves the analysis of the business domain and then designing solution logic that represents the different steps within the business process. Some of these steps relate just to that specific business process while others may be of use to other business processes as well. Part of this reusable logic pertains to the business entities that usually remains the same when compared to the rules and processing steps that may change in future. If services are designed that contain both process- specific logic and entity-specific logic, the chances of reusing the same entity-specific logic, from another business process, become somewhat negligible. On the other hand, if this kind of logic is split up into a separate container i.e. a service, then any new business processes, which make use of the same business entity, can reuse this logic. Apart from the reusability problem, in order to address the change in the behavior of a business entity, updating the entrenched entity related logic across multiple business processes requires extra efforts and makes the maintenance of such services a complex task. In response to the aforementioned issues, the Entity Abstraction pattern advocates that logic that relates to the processing of business entities be separated from the process-specific single purpose logic and designed as independent logic that has no knowledge of the overall business process in which such logic is being utilized.Matthew Dailey.Software Architecture Design Service-Oriented Architectures (Part II) [Online].Date accessed: 26 April 2010. Usage ERD An ERD showing the relationships between different business entities and their attributes. Entity Services Entity specific logic is identified from the above ERD and abstracted away in relevant functional contexts that constitute the entity services. The separation of reusable entity specific logic requires identification of such logic before the actual services are designed. This requires a top‚Äìdown service-oriented analysis and design service delivery process. During the analysis phase, different types of actions that are performed on and by business entities are identified and placed in a relevant process-neutral functional context that forms the basis for entity services. These entity services specifically contain functionality, including CRUD functions,Susanne Patig.Cases of Software Services Design in Practice[Online].Date accessed: 27 April 2010. that is only relevant to the physical or logical business entities, represented by their corresponding functional context. Apart from the identification of different actions, it is also important to discover any relationships between the business entities whether part of the current business process or not. By looking across different business processes, the entity service can be packed with extra functionality that may be required by other business processes. An important source of information for identifying such relationships are the ERDs as they physically display the relationships between different business entities and also identify the different attributes of entities that form the basis of the relationships among the entities. The resulting set of services represents the entity layer, which is one of the layers as advocated by the Service Layers design pattern. The application of the entity abstraction design pattern can be viewed as a specialized implementation of theAgnostic Context Agnostic Context design pattern as the Agnostic Context pattern advocates separating process-neutral logic from the process-specific logic, however, in case of Entity Abstraction pattern it is the entity-specific process-neutral logic that is being separated. The process of identifying entity services from business entities might not always result in a one-to-one mapping as on some occasions it might be logical to combine two entities into one because on their own they do not represent a significant part of functionality being performed on the entities. Considerations The application of this design pattern requires adopting top-down service-oriented analysis and design service delivery process which may not be suitable for organizations that have limited resources, both in terms of time and man-power. Another important aspect is that once the entity- specific logic has been abstracted away in entity services, the dependency on such entity services increases as they become the sole point of contact for utilization functionality that is of interest to multiple business processes. Consequently, it remain very important to have strict governance mechanisms in place so that a change in the functionality of an entity service does not result in behavior that is not expected by the service consumers that have already formed dependencies on such entity services.

The Puerta del Puente (Spanish: \\"Gate of the Bridge\\") is a Renaissance gate in C√≥rdoba, Andalusia. History In the sixteenth century, the authorities decided to improve the condition of the entrance to the city due to the deteriorated state of the existing gate. With this goal in mind, on February 18, 1572, mayor Alonso Gonzalez de Arteaga issued the order to build the Bridge Gate. Reasons given focused on the fact that it was one of the city's main gates, handling a high volume of movement in terms of both people and supplies. In addition to enlarging the gateway, the city's officials wished to improve the artistic merits of the gate as part of an urban renewal. Bridge Gate construction was started by Francisco de Montalb√°n although few months later, in 1571, Hern√°n Ruiz III which took over the works. Complications arose with respect to the design of the door, leading to a spike in the expected cost: the initial budget of 1400 ducats tripled to 3100. Work apparently stopped for a four year period until 1576, when Hern√°n Ruiz resumed his work. Possibly due to the indebtedness of the City Council of Cordoba and general lack of funds, the project remained was unfinished. In 1912, under the reign of Alfonso XIII, the area in which the Puerta del Puente was located was stripped of its walls and rebuilt in 1928 as a memorial gate, repeating on the inner side forms the outer side. In the late fifties the level of all the land bordering the door, until the original ground level was restored, when neighbouring buildings were lowered. In the early twenty-first century, the first restoration of the Puerta del Puente took place, at which point archaeological excavations took place. Further restorative work continued in 2005.

The film is based on J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski‚Äôs novel Hrabina Cosel, a historical romance set in the court of Augustus the Strong, the first of the two Saxon kings of Poland, at the turn of the 17th to 18th century.http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/19:1-2/noble-faces-beautiful- souls.pdf Plot The Countess Cosel is based on the true story of the beautiful Anna Constantia von Brockdorff, a German noblewoman who became mistress of Augustus the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony in 1704.http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/AugustII.html Against the backdrop of life at Augustus‚Äô court the movie follows the arrival at Dresden of 24-year- old Anna Constantia von Brockdorff, who is an inordinately beautiful and scrupulously devout young married woman; her romance with the king and her ‚Äòten year reign‚Äô as his mistress ‚Äì a role she consents to in the belief that she has won the king‚Äôs love and commitment; and finally, her heartbreak, disillusion and struggle against him. The conflict between Anna and the king arises from the fact that Anna takes seriously not only the relationship, but the written promise of marriage which she manages to secure from him during their courtship. Neither the relationship nor the contract is held in much esteem by Augustus, who replaces her, as he has always done, with another mistress, as soon as she loses for him the charm of novelty. Her valiant refusal to return the marriage promissory note upon request enrages him and delivers her to her miserable fate.http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/19:1-2/noble-faces-beautiful- souls.pdf In the opinion of the court, Cosel came to be considered increasingly dangerous when it became known that king Augustus had given her a secret written promise of marriage. Ultimately, she fell from grace with the king when she showed her jealousy after her spies told her about the king's affair with Countess Maria Magalena von D√∂nhoff of Warsaw. Distraught and feeling desperate to win back king's affection, Cosel departed Dresden to meet the king in Warsaw only to be turned back at the city gates. Augustus, having no more feelings for his former mistress, gave orders to lock her up in the Stolpen fortress. Cosel's faith and courage, which replaced her initial despair and anger culminated in her decision to remain in her jail, even after Augustus‚Äô death, thirty-two years before her own, opened the way for her to regain her freedom. As a result, Cosel was imprisoned for forty-nine years, before she died in 1765, being eighty-five years of age. To the end of her life she preserved traces of her great beauty, by which she became so famous.http://www.filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php/123562 Cast * Jadwiga Bara≈Ñska ‚Äì Anna Constantia von Brockdorff, countess Cosel * Mariusz Dmochowski ‚Äì Augustus II the Strong * Stanis≈Çaw Jasiukiewicz ‚Äì Raimund Zaklika, Polish soldier in love with Cosel and her faithful servant * Daniel Olbrychski ‚Äì King Charles XII of Sweden * Ignacy Gogolewski ‚Äì baron Frederic Kyan * Stanis≈Çaw Milski ‚Äì count Egon von F√ºrstenberg * Henryk Borowski ‚Äì count Adolf von Hoym, Cosel's husband * W≈Çadys≈Çaw Ha≈Ñcza ‚Äì Saxon general Schulenburg * Leon Niemczyk ‚Äì French count de Lecherenne * Krystyna Chmielewska ‚Äì Marianna D√∂nhoff, new mistress of the king Augustus * Mieczys≈Çaw Ka≈Çenik ‚Äì La Haye, lieutenant of the life guards * Maria Homerska ‚Äì Christiane Eberhardine, king's wife * W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dewoyno ‚Äì Holder, a Saxon nobleman * Bronis≈Çaw Pawlik ‚Äì Johann B√∂ttger, king's alchemist ReferencesExternal links * Category:1968 films Category:Polish films Category:Polish historical romance films Category:Polish-language films Category:Epic films Category:1960s historical romance films Category:1960s romantic drama films Category:Films based on Polish novels Category:Films set in the 18th century Category:Films set in Poland Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films set in Warsaw Category:Films directed by Jerzy Antczak Category:Cultural depictions of Charles XII of Sweden Category:Polish romantic drama films ","title":"Hrabina Cosel"},{"id":"26639560","text":"E.T., I Love You and Other Extra-Terrestrial Songs for Children is an album by the group the Starlight Children's Chorus, released in 1983 under Kid Stuff Records. It featured a song \\"E.T., I Love You\\" by Buckner & Garcia, which was originally written to accompany the major motion picture E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial. Background The song \\"E.T., I Love You\\" was originally written by Buckner & GarciaMcAleer, p. 28. and was recorded and released under Columbia Records in 1982. Appearing on a 7\\" vinyl as a single, their version of the song was written as a ballad.Sellers, p. 60. It was by permission and the liking of Steven Spielberg, intended to be released as a tribute song for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. But during virtually the same time period, Neil Diamond, another artist under CBS at the time, had recorded his own tribute song which caused a potential conflict for the record label to release and promote two songs on the same subject. Buckner & Garcia's song was held for release until later that year by the label in favor of \\"Heartlight\\", although their song remains to be seen as part of the movies' subsequent merchandising craze. It was performed by them on September 25, 1982 at the Georgia Music Festival, prior to receiving an award for Songwriters of the Year by the Atlanta Songwriters Association.Shaw, p. 15. Released under Kid Stuff, a record label devoted entirely to producing music catered for children, \\"E.T., I Love You\\" appeared on E.T., I Love You and Other Extra- Terrestrial Songs for Children. It also features six other alien related songs and an overture at the beginning, where a childlike voice with high levels of reverb asks questions like \\"Where did you come from? Another world?\\". Overall, the album has been called \\"freaky\\";. \\"So Near and Yet So Far\\" has been described as up-tempo, comparable to Debbie Gibson, and features the sound effects of robots and a toilet flushing, and \\"Please Phone Ring-a-Ling\\" is in the realm of doo-wop style of music. Although being recorded under the group title of \\"Children's Starlight Chorus\\", it is not actually sung by any children, but rather an alto female singer attempting to mimic the voice of a young boy. None of the music or any sound clips from the movie appear on the album. E.T., I Love You and Other Extra-Terrestrial Songs for Children has been described as sounding odd, and off-putting. The album has been noted as being obscure among purveyors of rare music. Unauthorized use of \\"E.T., I Love You\\" Nearly two decades later, Mr. Garcia was contacted regarding the version of their song \\"E.T., I Love You\\" appearing on the album by the Starlight Children's Chorus. He claimed to have no knowledge of that version. However, in both a 1999 5-song release called Now & Then, and in a 2002 re- release of their chart-topping album, Pac-Man Fever, Buckner & Garcia included their original version.

Plot Danish hairdresser Ida (Trine Dyrholm), who has recently completed a successful breast cancer treatment after undergoing a mastectomy, returns home to find her husband Leif having an affair with his accountant, Tilde. In a different part of Copenhagen, American businessman Philip, (Pierce Brosnan) is a successful exporter of fruits and vegetables who has become misanthropic after the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Ida's daughter Astrid and Philip's son Patrick have gone to Italy to prepare Patrick's family's villa for their wedding, which is to take place only three months after they met. Ida is in denial about her husband leaving her. She intends to travel alone to Italy for the wedding, but at Copenhagen airport she bumps into Philip for the first time (her car collides with Philip's). After he shouts at her for being a reckless driver he realizes she is Astrid's mother and the two travel the rest of the way to the villa together. They do not have a favourable view of one another as Philip finds Ida irritating while Ida thinks that Philip is rude and mean. At the villa drama ensues when Leif brings his new girlfriend, Tilde, to the wedding and everyone is surprised when she introduces herself as his fianc√©e. Upset, Ida goes for a swim in the cove near the house. Philip sees her swimming nude and runs to urge her out of the water as the current can be dangerous. On their walk home he shows her the groves of lemon and orange trees on the estate. Philip begins to feel attracted to Ida's warm and sunny personality and eventually confides the way in which his wife died to her. He also rejects the advances of Benedikte, his sister-in-law. At a celebration before the wedding Philip dances with Ida. He allows Leif to cut in but after he pushes Ida around their son comes to Ida's rescue and punches Leif. Philip then tells Ida she's beautiful and wonderful but they are interrupted by Benedikte. Back at the party Patrick sees Astrid grinding on Alessandro, a hired hand at the villa. He breaks them apart but Astrid tells him that he is gay. When he goes to apologize to Alessandro the two end up kissing. The morning of the wedding Patrick disappears. Philip finds him and Patrick confesses that he doesn't want to marry and only did it in part because he thought it was something Philip would want him to do. Before the ceremony Patrick and Astrid inform the guests they will not be getting married. Ida goes to comfort Astrid and Philip comforts Patrick. Philip is able to say goodbye to Ida before she leaves but they do not say anything of consequence. Sometime later after arriving back in Denmark Ida comes home to a house filled with roses. Leif tells Ida he still loves her and apologizes to her for leaving her for Tilde. Philip meanwhile finds his life cold and unsatisfactory. He goes to visit Ida at the salon where she works and tells her that he is cutting back on his workload and moving to Italy. He asks Ida to come and visit him. Ida tells him that Leif has moved back and that she loves him. Back at home Ida realizes she no longer loves Leif and dumps him. Ida goes to Italy, ditching her wig and wearing her short hair which is growing back from chemo. She goes to Italy where she finds Philip who has gone back to working in the lemon orchard on his estate. She asks him to sit with her while she opens a letter from the hospital giving her her latest test results. Philip and Ida kiss before they open the letter. After reading the results they smile and then kiss again.

He rose through the ranks in a mixture of domestic and foreign assignments during the interwar period until he was appointed Air Officer-in-Charge at RAF Headquarters in Singapore on 28 December 1937. By 7 September 1941, he was serving as an air commodore for RAF Fighter Command in Britain. He retired from the RAF on 24 February 1944. Early life and background Norton was born in Dolguan, Newtown, Montgomeryshire, the son of Clement W. Norton. He was educated at Newtown County School, and then worked at a motor establishment in Welshpool. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Norton was mobilized to serve in his Territorial Force regiment, the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry, as a despatch rider. On 25 May 1915 he was commissioned as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant to serve in the Royal Naval Air Service. Following flight training he was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1476 on 29 July after soloing a Maurice Farman biplane at the Central Flying School at Upavon. In September he was confirmed in his rank of flight sub-lieutenant, with seniority from 25 May, and was posted to No. 5 Squadron at Dover, but was soon transferred to \\"A\\" Squadron, No. 1 Wing. On 23 January 1916 Norton dropped a bomb on a U-boat, which had been previously attacked by another aircraft, whilst patrolling off Ostend. In March he was reported as having been injured in the foot, leg, and head during an attack on a Zeppelin. On 28 July he was promoted to flight lieutenant, and at some point afterwards was appointed an acting flight commander. Norton was back in action with No. 1 Wing on 20 October, flying a Nieuport 11 armed with Le Prieur rockets,Franks (2000), p.12. with which he destroyed an enemy observation balloon at Ostend. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for this action, which was gazetted on 1 January 1917. His citation read: Norton was then transferred to No. 6 Squadron, flying a Nieuport 17bis, serving on the Western Front. On 8 February 1917 he drove down an Aviatik C out of control over Houthulst Forest, and on 27 February he was again appointed an acting flight commander. On 5 April he downed two Albatros D.IIs west of Douai, and on 9 April two Albatros D.IIIs over Cambrai, also surviving a crash landing that burnt out his aircraft.Franks (2000), p.32. He drove down another D.III east of Honnecourt early on 29 April, and later the same day he accounted for two more D.IIIs over Guise, to bring his victory total to nine. Norton was promoted to flight commander on 30 June, and as an acting squadron commander was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 12 Squadron on 1 July, then commanded No. 9 Squadron from 15 September, finally receiving promotion to squadron commander on 31 December 1917. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Army's Royal Flying Corps were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and Norton was transferred to the new force with the rank of major. He commanded No. 204 Squadron RAF from 27 July, then No. 65 Wing from December. Inter-war career In the immediate post-war period Norton received several decorations from the Allies. He was made an Officer of the Order of the Crown by Belgium on 8 February 1919, and was awarded the Croix de guerre with Palm by France on 5 April, and received the Belgian Croix de guerre on 15 July. On 1 August 1919 Norton was granted a permanent commission in the RAF, initially with the rank of major, later changed to squadron leader. On 21 February 1920 Norton was appointed to the staff of the No. 1 School of Technical Training (Boys), and then served as an instructor at the No. 1 Flying Training School from 1 October 1923. He was then sent to Iraq, where he was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 6 Armoured Car Company on 5 December 1924. On 1 July 1925 he was promoted to wing commander, and on 1 December took command of No. 70 Squadron, based at RAF Hinaidi. The following year Norton returned to England, being transferred to the Home Establishment on 20 August 1926, and was posted temporarily to the Depot at RAF Uxbridge before attending a Staff Course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, from 28 September. On completion of his studies Norton was slated for command of No. 7 Squadron based at RAF Worthy Down, but this was later cancelled and instead he was appointed commander of No. 58 Squadron on 28 July 1927. On 30 June 1928, during the ninth annual Royal Air Force Display at Hendon Aerodrome, Norton took part in the \\"Aerial Parade\\" led by the prototype Beardmore Inflexible, Boulton & Paul Partridge, Hawker Hawfinch, and Bristol Bulldog aircraft, followed by the Vickers Virginia and Handley Page Hyderabad bombers of No. 7, No. 58 and No. 10 Squadrons, and the Fairey Foxes of No. 12, Hawker Horsleys of No. 11, and the Hawker Woodcocks of No. 3 and No. 17 fighter squadrons. In August Norton led No. 58 Squadron in the 1928 Air Manoeuvres, as part of the attacking \\"Eastland\\" forces under Air Vice-Marshal Sir John M. Steel, against the defenders of \\"Westland\\" commanded by Air Vice- Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. The exercises were designed to test unit efficiency, and to improve the co-ordination of air and ground defence systems in organization, tactics, and communications. On 7 December 1928 Norton was appointed temporary Station Commander of RAF Worthy Down, before returning to command of No. 58 Squadron on 18 April 1929. In the Air Manoeuvres of August 1930 he led No. 58 Squadron as part on the attacking Blue forces, against the defending Red forces.

He studied at the University of Naples Federico II under Antonio Genovesi. At the age of twenty, he became special lecturer in moral philosophy there, at the same time practising law. He was friend of Gaetano Filangieri, entering the masonry with him, and was elected venerable master of the Neapolitan lodge \\"La philantropia\\". Pagano was one of the men who powerfully helped Italy in her social and scientific advancement and in the 1790s he had striven more than any other intellectual to give a political form to the 18th century reform tradition in southern Italy.Girolamo Imbruglia, Naples in the Eighteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 168 His work Saggi politici (1783‚Äì85) provided a philosophical history of the Kingdom of Naples, arguing against torture and capital punishment and advocating more benign penal codes. Considerazioni sul processo criminale (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), gave him international popularity and was much praised by Le Moniteur Universel, the main newspaper of the revolutionary France.Biancamaria Fontana, The Invention of the Modern Republic, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 140 In 1794 he defended Vincenzo Galiani, Vincenzo Vitaliani and Emanuele De Deo ‚Äì three alleged conspirators against Ferdinand IV; after they were sentenced to death, Pagano was deprived of his professorship, arrested, imprisoned and expelled from the kingdom.Francesco Mario Pagano (1748-1799) After fleeing Naples in 1796, he returned in 1799 and drafted the constitution of the short- lived Neapolitan Republic. The document bore similarities to the French Constitution of 1793 but presented original traits such as the institution of the \\"body of ephors\\", an authority who would have overseen the maintenance of the law. It is considered the precursor of the modern constitutional court.Maria Rosa Di Simone, Istituzioni e fonti normative in Italia dall'Antico Regime al fascismo, p. 111, Giappichelli, Torino, 2007. After the fall of the republic, Pagano was arrested and imprisoned in the Castel Nuovo. He was executed by hanging at the \\"Piazza del Mercato\\" in Naples, along with other revolutionaries: Domenico Cirillo, Giorgio Pigliacelli and Ignazio Ciaia. Pagano's other juridical or philosophical works included Progetto di Costituzione della Repubblica napoletana, Sul processo criminale, Esame politico dell‚Äôintera legislazione romana, and Discorso sull‚Äôorigine e natura della poesia. He also translated works from Greek and Latin, and wrote six tragedies (Gerbino, Agamennone, Corradino, Gli esuli tebani, Prometeo, and Teodosio) and one comedy (Emilia).

The station operates one lifeboat which is used for inshore work. The lifeboat service is a \\"Declared Facility\\"; this means that H.M. Coastguard regard it as being on a par with the RNLI. The lifeboat provides its service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to windsurfers, fishing boats, swimmers and divers or anybody in distress within the Mundesley area. The service has also provided assistance to boats of various sizes which have required towing etc. History The Parish Council of Mundesley became very concerned after a tragedy occurred half a mile off the beach in Mundesley in 1971. The incident resulted in the drowning and near drowning of a man and his wife whilst sailing their boat. A meeting was called by the Council to discuss the feasibility of establishing an Inshore Lifeboat at Mundesley. It was decided to contact the RNLI and Coastguard to ask for help in setting up a service. Their response was that they would be unable to help due to heavy commitments to other stations in the area. Independent service Undiscouraged by this response the Council decided they would set up an independent rescue service. This service would be funded and manned from within the village. As a result of a series of meetings held by the council \\"The Mundesley Volunteer Inshore Lifeboat Service Ltd\\" was formed. The organization was to be a Limited Company and registered charity. Being a Limited Company, a board of directors was duly elected who were chosen from a broad section of the local community including proposed crew members. The volunteer crew would take care of the day-to-day running of the boat and the station, whilst the directors would take care of the policy making, fund raising and financial arrangements. Service commences By the spring of 1972 the organization was ready to start its service. A Zodiac inflatable was acquired to use as the lifeboat which had been borrowed from a local businessman. This lifeboat was housed in a temporary boathouse on the promenade at the East end of the village. Throughout the summer of 1972 an extensive fund raising campaign was initiated which resulted in the purchase of a 4M Avon Sea Rider semi rigid inflatable which was wholly owned by the new Service. Contractors at the close by Bacton Gas Terminal donated a wooden site hut which was converted into a boathouse. Stability Since those early days the Service has gone from strength to strength and has taken part in the rescue of some 100 people in trouble. The lifeboat is call out to service by a pager system which is activated by H M Coastguard from their Great Yarmouth operations room. The lifeboat works closely with other Lifeboat stations in the area both inshore and offshore, and also with the RAF Search and Rescue Helicopter Squadron now located at Wattisham in Suffolk. All the crew members are volunteers who are trained in all aspects of search and rescue work, boat handling, first aid, and navigation. The volunteers undertake training all year round. There are lifeboat crew on duty at the station every Sunday and Bank Holiday during the summer months. New station A new Lifeboat station was built in 2006 which was funded entirely by donations received by the public. The new station is a steel-framed building which has block and brick curtain walling. The roof is constructed from insulated steel cladding. The interior consist of a main boat hall in which the boat and the tractor sit side by side ready for service. Also on the ground floor is the drying room which holds all of the crew's personal protection equipment such as drysuits, helmets and lifejackets. This room is constantly kept warm and damp free to prolong the life of the crews valuable kit. The first floor consists of four main rooms. The lookout is situated on the eastern elevation so that almost the whole of the Mundesley guard is visible. Also kept in this room are charts of the coast and two VHF radios so a constant communications can be kept with the boat whilst it is out at sea. A second room, next door is used as a crew training room. In this room the Lifeboat service hold the majority of their meetings. It is also where training sessions, which are held fortnightly on a Monday night, take place. The other two rooms on the first floor are used as the Coxswains office and a Kitchen area.

Cellulite occurs in most postpubescent females. A review gives a prevalence of 85-98% of women, indicating that it is physiological rather than pathological. It can result from a complex combination of factors ranging from hormones to heredity.  Causes  The causes of cellulite include changes in metabolism, physiology, diet and exercise habits, obesity, sex-specific dimorphic skin architecture, alteration of connective tissue structure, hormonal factors, genetic factors, the microcirculatory system, the extracellular matrix, and subtle inflammatory alterations. Hormonal factors Hormones play a dominant role in the formation of cellulite. Estrogen may be the important hormone in the development of cellulite. However, there has been no reliable clinical evidence to support such a claim. Other hormones, including insulin, the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, thyroid hormones, and prolactin, are all believed to participate in the development of cellulite. Genetic factors There is a genetic element in individual susceptibility to cellulite. Researchers have traced the genetic component of cellulite to particular polymorphisms in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1a) genes. Predisposing factors Several factors have been shown to affect the development of cellulite. Sex, ethnicity, biotype, distribution of subcutaneous fat, and predisposition to lymphatic and circulatory insufficiency have all been shown to contribute to cellulite. Lifestyle A high-stressful lifestyle causes an increase in the level of catecholamines, which have also been associated with the development of cellulite.  Treatments  Cellulite is a multifactorial condition, and can be resistant to an array of treatments. Aside from 'topical' products (creams, ointments) and injectables (collagenase), treatments for cellulite include non-invasive therapy such as mechanical suction or mechanical massage. Energy-based devices include radio frequency with deep penetration of the skin, ultrasound, laser and pulsed-light devices. Combinations of mechanical treatments and energy-based procedures are widely used. More invasive 'subcision' techniques utilise a needle-sized microscalpel to cut through the causative fibrous bands of connective tissue. Subcision procedures (manual, vacuum-assisted, or laser-assisted) are performed in specialist clinics with patients given local anaesthetic.  Epidemiology  Cellulite is thought to occur in 80‚Äì90% of post-adolescent females. There appears to be a hormonal component to its presentation. Its existence as a real disorder has been challenged and the prevailing medical opinion is that it is merely the \\"normal condition of many women\\". It is rarely seen in males, but is more common in males with androgen-deficient states, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, hypogonadism, postcastration states and in those patients receiving estrogen therapy for prostate cancer.  History  The term was first used in the 1920s by spa and beauty services to promote their services, and began appearing in English-language publications in the late 1960s, with the earliest reference in Vogue magazine, \\"Like a swift migrating fish, the word cellulite has suddenly crossed the Atlantic.\\"Vogue 15 Apr 1968 110/1 The medicalization of cellulite (treating it like a medical problem) was popular for a time, as it drove sales of cosmetic treatments.

The Ptolemaic army was the army of the Ptolemaic Macedonian kings that ruled Egypt from 305 to 30 BC. Like most of the other armies of the Diadochi, it was very much Macedonian in style, with the use of the long pike (sarissa) in a deep phalanx formation. Despite the strength of the Ptolemaic army, evinced in 217 BC with the victory over the Seleucids at the Battle of Raphia, the Ptolemaic kingdom itself fell into decline and by the time of Julius Caesar, it was but a mere client-kingdom of the Roman Republic. The army by the time of Caesar‚Äôs campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean was a mere shadow of its former self: generally, a highly disorganized assemblage of mercenaries and other foreign troops. The army of Ptolemy I A stele of Dioskourides, dated 2nd century BC, showing a Ptolemaic thureophoros soldier (wielding the thureos shield). It is a characteristic example of the \\"romanization\\" of the Ptolemaic army. Ptolemy I was a general in the army of Alexander the Great and after Alexander‚Äôs death had taken over the province of Egypt as a satrap (local governor). Along with the other successors to Alexander he did not hold the title of king until 305, but was still an important player in the affairs of the Macedonian Empire in the east. In 312 BC at Gaza, Ptolemy, who was assisting the fugitive satrap of Babylonia, Seleucus I, came up against the forces of Antigonus I who was seen as a major threat to the stability of the empire due to his strength and power. Ptolemy had a force of 18,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, these being a mixture of Macedonians, mercenaries, and native Egyptians.Diod.XIX.80.85 His forces were larger than those of Antigonus and his son, Demetrius Poliorketes. In the battle for Gaza, Antigonus‚Äô cavalry, commanded by Demetrius, were initially successful but forced to retreat after Ptolemy out-flanked them. The battle was a victory for Ptolemy who soon secured Syria for himself and placed Seleucus in Babylonia to govern the eastern provinces of the empire. By 305 Ptolemy had taken the title of king, along with the other most powerful generals, including Cassander, Seleucus, and Antigonus. In 301 BC, the threat of Antigonus was finally ended with his death at the Battle of Ipsus. But despite this, the rivalry between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids for Syria would cause numerous wars in the future. The army under Ptolemy I was most likely composed of small Macedonian and mercenary garrisons left in Egypt by Alexander.Head, 1982, p.20 The manpower problem In the Ptolemaic era a small population of Greeks provided the main cadre of the army. These men provided manpower for the elite guards units and the phalanx that lay at its core. However, the distance of Egypt from Greece caused considerable difficulties as the population of Greeks in Egypt was and remained small. To remedy this problem, the Ptolemies set up military colonies and encouraged settlers to settle in them. In return for these plots of land, the kleruchoi, as they were known, would be obligated to provide military service.Chaniotis, 2006, p.85 Mercenaries were also employed by the Ptolemies, who could afford it due to their wealth. For example, Ptolemy IV paid 1,000 drachmas a day for one distinguished Aetolian officer to serve in his armies.Cary, 1978, p.235 This system gave the Ptolemies more manpower, however they still suffered severe shortages. Despite this lack of manpower, they would not allow native Egyptians to fight in the army proper. The natives would only serve in the navy or as auxiliaries.Garlan, 1984, p.354 This changed by the time of Raphia in 217 when the situation became especially dire for the Ptolemies. Their army was far too small to counter the far superior Seleucid force led by the formidable Antiochus III. To counter the larger Seleucid force, the general Sosibius assembled a large army which he trained for the fight to come, and in which he also enrolled 30,000 native Egyptians to serve in the phalanx.Polyb.V.63.8-65.11 These 30,000 picked Egyptians, known as the Machimoi Epilektoi, fought well in the battle, but caused problems later on. The increased status of these Egyptian troops enabled and encouraged them to revolt, which led to a further crippling of the kingdom in the years following Raphia. Later years and Roman influence Reforms in the late Seleucid and Ptolemaic armies re-organised them and tried to add some Roman aspects to formations. Stelae from Hermopolis show a Ptolemaic unit having a standard- bearer and other staff attached. This unit was like a Roman Maniple, being composed of two smaller units led by a Hekatontarch (i.e. a Centurion). The title of Hekatontarch appeared around the 250s BC in the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) which uses hekatontarchos (·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑŒøŒΩœÑŒ¨œÅœáŒøœÖœÇ acc. pl.) to refer to 'captains of hundreds' (eg 2Chr25:5). As well as this, Asclepiodotus describes in his 'Tactica' a new institution, the Syntagma, which had a standard-bearer, other staff and was composed of two smaller units led by Hekatontarchs. The Phalangarkhia, also described by Asclepiodotus, was about the size of a Roman Legion in strength. The potential Roman influence would have been great. In Ptolemaic Egypt, Roman adventurers and veterans are found commonly serving under the Ptolemies. Romans are found in Ptolemaic service as early as 252/1 BC.[22] The Ptolemaic army was odd in that, out of all the Hellenistic armies, it was the only army where you could find Romans in Greek service. As Sekunda suggests 'such individuals would have spread knowledge of Roman military systems within the Ptolemaic military and political establishment' However, the continuous struggles for power between Ptolemaic kings and the decline of the kingdom itself soon turned the army into a mere shadow of its former self: generally, a highly disorganized assemblage of mercenaries and other foreign troops. In 61 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Roman Syria, restored the king to the throne after a short campaign. Then he left a part of his army, called after him the Gabiniani, in Egypt for the king's protection. These Roman troops also included Gallic and German horsemen. They married Egyptian women and had already fathered children with them before the arrival of Caesar in Egypt (48 BC). Over time, they lost their connection with Rome and became a loyal protecting power of Ptolemy XII, who used them in fights against rebellious subjects. When Julius Caesar arrived in Egypt and supported Cleopatra in the struggle between her and her brother. Pothinus organized military opposition against Caesar. In the Alexandrinian war that followed, the Gabiniani played an important role: they were the core divisions of Achillas' army that comprised 20,000 infantrymen and 2000 cavalrymen. After the successful conclusion of the Alexandrinian war, Caesar replaced the Gabiniani with three reliable legions, the XXVII, XXVIII and XXIX. These served as the Roman occupying army of Egypt and were tasked with protecting Cleopatra but also to ensure the queen's loyalty to Rome.

Three variants were produced including a military variant called the Mars but none entered production. Design and development With a French Air Force requirement to replace the Douglas C-47 and Amiot AAC-1 Br√©guet started development of the Breguet 890 as a medium-capacity military transport. The commercial transport prototype designated the Br√©guet 890H Mercure was an all-metal cantilever high-wing monoplane powered by two Bristol Hercules radial engines. It had a retractable tricycle landing gear and, advanced for its day, a swing tail to allow access (using a loading ramp) into the fuselage for heavy equipment and vehicles. A military prototype was also built under the designation Br√©guet 891R Mars, it retained the swing tail but had provision for 20 paratroopers and was powered by two Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14R-200 radial engines. The Mars had parachute doors on each side of the fuselage, a floor chute for dropping containers and also a towing hook for a glider. The third variant and the first to fly on 1 March 1949 was a convertible passenger/cargo aircraft, designated the Br√©guet 892S Mercure. Although based on the 890H the 892S had four Renault 12S inline piston engines. It had a large cargo door on the starboard side and two passenger doors in the port side.

They are also known as Bernal‚ÄìFowler rules, after British physicists John Desmond Bernal and Ralph H. Fowler who first described them in 1933. The rules state each oxygen is covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and that the oxygen atom in each water molecule forms two hydrogen bonds with other oxygens, so that there is precisely one hydrogen between each pair of oxygen atoms.cf. In other words, in ordinary Ih ice, every oxygen is bonded to the total of four hydrogens, two of these bonds are strong and two of them are much weaker. Every hydrogen is bonded to two oxygens, strongly to one and weakly to the other. The resulting configuration is geometrically a periodic lattice. The distribution of bonds on this lattice is represented by a directed-graph (arrows) and can be either ordered or disordered. In 1935, Linus Pauling used the ice rules to calculate the residual entropy (zero temperature entropy) of ice Ih. For this (and other) reasons the rules are sometimes mis-attributed and referred to as \\"Pauling's ice rules\\" (not to be confused with Pauling's rules for ionic crystals).

Lamond (1947 ‚Äì 24 October 2018) was an Australian film director, producer and screenwriter. He was best known for directing such films as Felicity, A Slice of Life, Breakfast in Paris and Nightmares. Before becoming a director he worked in distribution for Roadshow. He was featured in the documentary Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! Career=Early career Lamond began working in the industry at Channel O in Melbourne in the props department. He later became a film editor and worked for several companies, mostly making TV ads at places such as Ajax Studios. Distribution In 1969 he moved into the feature film industry when he was hired by Terry Turtle to help with the roadshow release of This Year Jerusalem. After that he became involved in the release of The Naked Bunyip (1970), showing it around the country, which led to him performing a similar function on The Adventures of Barry McKenzie before Roadshow took over the release of the film. Turtle then hired Lamond to handle the Australian release of Dynamite Chicken. He designed a poster of a nun in a compromising position which caused a great deal of controversy, earning the ire of then- Minister for Customs, Don Chipp, and got Lamond a job offer from the Roadshow organisation to work in distribution.Interview with John Lamond, Mondo Stumpo, early 2002 accessed 14 October 2012 Lamond stayed with Roadshow for six months, working on the release of Alvin Purple and a number of other films, then he took a trip around the world with Byron Kennedy looking at various production and distribution set ups. He produced a short documentary with Kennedy, The Devil in Evening Dress (1974), which was an early directorial effort from George Miller. Australia After Dark and The ABC of Love and Sex He came back keen to make his first film and made the documentary Australia After Dark (1975). The movie was very successful and for the next few years Lamond alternated between making films and working for Roadshow's publicity department, making trailers and radio and TV spots. He would go away for eight weeks to make the movie then promote it while also working at Roadshow. He did this for The ABC of Love and Sex: Australia Style but stopped it in 1977 when it became too time consuming and Lamond became a full-time filmmaker. Feature films Lamond's dramatic feature film debut was Felicity (1979), an erotic - some would say 'sexploitation' flick, that turned out to be popular worldwide. Lamond hoped to make a sequel, but could not raise the requisite financing. He then did a sex comedy in the vein of the \\"Carry On\\" films, Pacific Banana (1980), written by Alan Hopgood. The intention was to launch a series but the film was not a financial success.

Lamond"},{"id":"26639910","text":"Maria de Luna (c. 1358 ‚Äì 1406) was queen consort of Aragon, as the spouse of King Martin I of Aragon, from his ascension in 1396 to her death in 1406. In the early years of Martin's reign, she served as regent of Aragon while her husband tended to affairs in Sicily, a kingdom to which he also had a claim. She was the daughter and heiress of the Aragonese noble Lope, Lord and 1st Count of Luna and Lord of Segorbe and his second wife Brianda d‚ÄôAgout, an aristocratic woman from Provence. Maria was betrothed to Martin (future King of Aragon) as a child, and brought up at the court of Martin's mother, Queen Eleanor of Sicily. The couple married in Barcelona on 13 June 1372, and Maria became queen upon her husband's accession in 1396. At the time of his accession to the throne, Martin was in Sicily, so Maria acted as regent alongside Queen Dowager Violant of Bar, and Matthew, Count of Foix until Martin's return in 1397. Maria was politically active and exerted influence upon both policy and society, and was considered by some a more talented ruler than Martin himself. She supported the poor financially, handled taxes, welcomed Jewish and Muslim refugees, attempted to end conflict between noble houses, and corresponded directly with the Avignon-based Antipope Benedict XIII (himself Aragonese) to suggest bans toward laws and practices she saw as unjust. Described as wise, just, merciful, and religious without being a fanatic, she was interested in music and literature but unimpressed by pomp and luxury.  Early years  Born in 1358, Maria was the eldest child of Count Lope de Luna and his second wife, Brianda d‚ÄôAgout. Her family was one of the most influential in Spain, its members occupying some of the loftiest political and religious offices in the realm. She could, for example, count Lope Fernandez de Luna, Archbishop of Zaragoza and Antipope Benedict XIII amongst her relations. Her father promoted the interests of the family still further. His unwavering loyalty to and political service on behalf of the Aragonese Crown was handsomely rewarded ‚Äì first he was knighted then, several years later, made a count. Her house thereafter had the distinction of being the only one in Aragon with a member to reach the rank of \\"count\\".Silleras- Fernandez, p. 14-15 As Lope's first marriage to Violant of Aragon produced no children, Maria was formally named her father's sole heir shortly after her birth. Although Lope had an older, illegitimate son and went on to have a second, posthumous daughter by Brianda, Maria's status as heir was never compromised or revoked.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 13  Betrothal  Lope's death in 1360 left two-year-old Maria as one of the wealthiest landowners in Spain. For this reason, she soon attracted the attention of Peter IV the Ceremonious, King of Aragon, who was eager to arrange a marriage for his younger son, Martin. The negotiations were conducted on Maria's side by her mother and her powerful kinsman, the Archbishop of Zaragoza.Silleras- Fernandez, p. 13-14 Finalized in the summer of 1361, the betrothal terms stipulated that Maria would remain with her own family until age eight, at which point she would move to the court of her future mother-in-law, Eleanor of Sicily, before marrying Martin at the age of fourteen.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 17  At the Aragonese court  The schedule described in Maria and Martin's betrothal contract appears to have been expedited somewhat. Maria first shows up in Queen Eleanor's account books as early as 1362, suggesting that she moved to court around age four or five ‚Äì several years earlier than the terms of her engagement originally stipulated. Thus, she grew up in close proximity to her future husband. Although there is little information available about her upbringing at court, her education was in all likelihood a thorough one, given surviving evidence of her writing, the collection of books she possessed, and how quickly she took over the administration of her estates upon coming of age.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 19-20  Marriage  On 13 June 1372 Maria and Martin wed at the Church of Santa Maria del Mar in Barcelona, in the presence of King Peter, Bishop Jaume of Valencia, and many of the realm's most distinguished noblemen. In the ensuing years, Maria was largely preoccupied with child-bearing, household administration, and the management of her personal estates.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 27 She and her husband enjoyed considerable royal favor; in the fifteen years following Maria and Martin's marriage, King Peter continued to bestow offices and lands upon his younger son. Upon Peter's death on 5 January 1368, his firstborn son succeeded him as King John I. Within weeks of his accession to the throne, John made his brother Martin Duke of Montblanc. Previously the only other duchy in Aragon was that of Girona, a title reserved for the heir to the throne. Such a grant was therefore an enormous honor for Martin and the newly made duchess, Maria, as well.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 24-25  Reign = Regency  In 1396, King John died without a legitimate heir. The throne of Aragon consequently passed to John's younger brother, Maria's husband Martin. At this time, however, Martin was on a military campaign in Sicily and would not receive word of his brother's death for a number of weeks.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 42-43 Fortuitously at hand in Barcelona, Maria was therefore acclaimed queen and appointed to serve as the Crown's lieutenant-general in her husband's absence.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 41 Maria's transition from duchess to queen was fraught with insurrection and uncertainty. In a desperate bid to retain power, the dowager queen, Violant of Bar, insisted that she was pregnant with John's posthumous child. Many nobles were subsequently hesitant to support Maria and Martin right away, in case Violant should produce a son. At the same time, John's daughter from his first marriage, Joanna de Foix, attempted to claim the Aragonese throne for herself, a claim supported by her husband, Matthew de Foix, and his powerful family.Although Joanna had at one point been named her father‚Äôs heir, later wills had expressly excluded her from successionSilleras- Fernandez, p. 43-47 Amidst this unrest, Maria unsuccessfully tried to convince Martin to return to Aragon and assist her in stabilizing the realm. Reluctant to abandon his military campaign, however, Martin resisted his wife's entreaties for many months. Claiming to be concerned about Violant's health during the latter's supposed pregnancy, Maria had her rival removed to one of her own castles, isolating her from her supporters. Soon enough, Violant's pregnancy was exposed as a sham.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 60-61 Maria then assembled an army, imprisoned Violant and Matthew's suspected supporters, and stripped them of their Aragonese holdings. After a series of advances and retreats by Joanna and Matthew, Maria finally and decisively subdued them. Martin returned home soon thereafter.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 60-61  Return of Martin  Martin's return to Aragon in 1397 ‚Äì many months into his reign ‚Äì meant the end of Maria's time as lieutenant-general. Her importance over the next thirteen years before her death), however, remained substantial. She had a close relationship with her surviving son, Martin, and was a critical source of advice for him during his brief reign over Sicily. Her husband also clearly continued to view her as a key counselor and source of support, a relationship reflected by their extensive epistolary exchanges.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 62-63  Death = Faith and spirituality  Martin I's illuminated text of psalm 59Mar√≠a de Luna was a proponent of the so-called devotio moderna, a type of Christian worship that rose to prominence in the later Middle Ages which emphasized oral prayer and intense affective meditation upon the words and deeds of Jesus. Joan Eiximenio was her personal confessor, and he translated Arbor vitae crucifixus (\\"the book of life of the crucified\\") of Ubertino de Calae (1259‚Äì1330) into Catalan. This project led to Eiximenio's realization that more texts should be translated into Catalan, especially for use during the 40 days of Lent. During Mar√≠a and Martin's reign, he compiled \\"Quarentena de contemplacio\\", a collection of prayers and meditations for Lent. Mar√≠a de Luna associated with the Franciscan friars and donated money for their monastic foundation of the Holy Spirit (the Monasterio del Santo Esp√≠ritu).Planas, p. 3-7 Inventory of items Mar√≠a de Luna's household used.  Day to day administration  Records of Maria de Luna's court's food consumption, purchases, food quality and quantity, and methods of preparation have implications for structures of daily life in the Iberian Peninsula during the early fifteenth century. Compared to those surviving for other households of similar rank in this period, the accounts of Maria de Luna in \\"Food in the Accounts of a Travelling lady: Maria de Luna, queen of Aragon, in 1403\\" contain more detail, describing specific dishes cooked for the queen's table, the food consumption per person, the weight of the animals used for meat, and the amounts of wheat used to make a certain quantity of bread. As with the king, every meal Maria de Luna ate was a public display; what she ate, drank, and how she behaved distinguished her from others and made her a model for those around her. Customs were distinct in every royal household, and Maria de Luna's was defined by \\"her close relationship with the mendicant orders and with charity, but also through the attention she paid to medical advice, given her fragile health.\\" Even during Lent, for instance, she ate poultry at her doctors's advice due to the \\"vitality [it] brought to sick bodies\\".Marsilla Maria de Luna's accounts from 1403 also reflect the lavishness of the court in Valencia and the consistency and variety of foodstuffs also indicates the queen's prestige. An analysis of the accounts of 1403 describes how at stake \\"was the image that the queen projected to her guests, and in general to her subjects; food and the general levels of display that went with it on a daily basis were among the principal elements of prestige available to her.\\"Marsilla Valencian agriculture was able to provide a wide variety of food to the city's market. But even as Maria de Luna travelled to smaller locations during the year of 1403, the court was still able to provide a plethora of food to the household. This suggests that suppliers could have been following Maria de Luna as she travelled. Statue of Maria de Luna outside the Church of St. Martin, Segorbe  Political policy = Policy towards minorities  In 1398, Mar√≠a de Luna gained control over seven Jewish and six Muslim communities, and assumed responsibility for the aljama, the official legal term for the minority group encompassing both Muslims and Jews.Meyerson, p. 66 She exercised power over the Jews of Morvedre, a community 20 kilometers north of Valencia, making policies that helped this community recover from turmoil. Morvedre had been the target of a number of violent attacks and massacres. In November 1348, troops from the Union of Valencia invaded it, and it was attacked once more by rebels who were fighting against King Peter III. From the winter of 1363 to March 1365, Castilian troops occupied the town, and the Jewish population of the entire kingdom of Aragon was vulnerable in 1391, when the Dominican preacher Vincent Ferrer incited violence against Jews, while King Fernando I supported existing efforts to convert Jews.Meyerson, p. 55 As the Jewish community of Morvedre was getting back on its feet after the crises of 1391, it faced financial difficulties due to the high number of refugees that flowed in. Mar√≠a de Luna chose not to impose the higher rate of taxation that King Peter III had originally established, allowing them to pay only a quarter of the amount, as King John I had done beforehand.Meyerson, p. 68 Mar√≠a also used her royal power in 1401 to prevent the jurats, the local authorities, from taxing the Jewish community. The local authorities attempted to levy a property tax on Jewish assets, even though Jews had historically been paying their taxes directly to the monarchs.Meyerson, p. 73 Mar√≠a once more swam against the tide of the jurats' public opinion in 1403, when her husband Martin passed a law that would force Jews in the kingdom to wear large badges of both yellow and red. Mar√≠a rejected this measure, ensuring that it would not be enforced in Morvedre or in Onda, a place where many Jews conducted trade. Although the Jews had been obligated to wear red badges since John I mandated it in 1396, these had been smaller and much more inconspicuous than the proposed new badge, which was intended to clearly set the Jews apart from the Christians.Meyerson, p. 71 Mar√≠a de Luna's Jewish policy appears to have been motivated both by material interests and by more general concerns for the Jewish population. When Mar√≠a realized that Jacob Fa√ßan, a Jew who had provided much monetary assistance to the throne, was being investigated for unfaithfulness to the Catholic religion, she intervened to protect him. In an attempt to mitigate the effects of inquisitions, she originally tried to use a bargaining tactic, recognizing that some Jews might indeed deserve punishment, but rather trying to regulate the forms of investigation to which they were subject. Mar√≠a's stance towards inquisitors did not stop them all from trying to prosecute Jews, however, and when a case arose against Jewish women who supposedly had renounced their prior conversion to Catholicism, she forced the bishop who had imprisoned the women to let them go. Her analysis of the matter led her to realize that the case had been allowed to go on for too long and that it violated her previous statement of values:Meyerson, p. 74-77 that \\"our rights and our vassals...will remain whole\\".From Arxiu de la Corona d' Arago, C 2335 89v-90r, qtd. In Meyerson, p. 74  Economic policy  When Martin joined Mar√≠a in May 1397, she stepped down from her position as lieutenant of Aragon, but she continued to play an active role in her position as queen consort. In 1402, she sought to end the exploitation of the remen√ßa, the rural Catalonian peasantry by their aristocratic overlords, decrying such practices as \\"bad habits\\" (malos usos). Mar√≠a de Luna unsuccessfully sought the support of Pope Benedict XIII in this matter.Fernandez, p. 84-85  Recognition and legacy  In the 1390s, the Franciscan theologian Francesc Eiximenis adapted his previous work, the Llibre de les dones, for Maria de Luna, and composed for her the Scala Dei (\\"Ladder of God\\"), a devotional text accompanied by a set of prayers written in Catalan (with some notes in Latin) and presented to her shortly after she became queen. Eiximenis did not just have a literary influence of Maria de Luna. Around thirty years older than her, he knew her from the time she was a child and acted as a paternal figure for Maria and Marti. He never served as an official counselor, but he was an executor o Maria's will and testament. The Scala Dei includes the Ten Commandments, essays on the virtues of femininity and queenship, the seven deadly sins, a treatise on penance, and a treatise on contemplation. Eiximenis hoped that the Scala Dei would attract the Crown of Aragon to the reform movement of Observant Franciscanism, which was then in its beginnings. Maria de Luna's reputation during her ascent to the throne sharply contrasted with that of Violant de Bar, whom the Franciscans saw as \\"overly frivolous, too French, and scandalously neglectful of the affairs of the state\\".Silleras-Fernandez, p. 100. Maria de Luna likely requested two copies of the Scala Dei for herself, one in 1397 and one in 1404. As Eiximenis explained in the dedicatory preface to his work: Most High Lady, many times your great Ladyship has encouraged me, for the improvement of your spiritual life, to prepare as you request some little book from which you might derive some guidance or light to better guard you from any offence to God, and that you might most aptly enjoy in all virtue, and better please God: for which, Most High Lady, I‚Äîwishing to satisfy your pious intentions, and for the sound increase of your devotion‚Äîhave assembled the following book.BNE: Ms. 92, f. 1r. The structure and message of the Scala Dei reflect broader traditions of devotional literature meant for women in the later Middle Ages. \\"At this time women were considered susceptible to excesses of passion; hence, conduct and devotional literature were intended to calm them and‚Äîfollowing Saint Augustine‚Äîto redirect the troublesome influences of passions on the body and the mind to more salubrious and pious ends.\\"Silleras-Fernandez, p. 100. Eiximenis' views on gender influenced his portrayal of Maria de Luna in the Scala Dei. For Eiximenis, \\"feminine space was constructed around and limited to the home, the family, and the body\\",Silleras-Fernandez, p. 104. which meant that instead of characterizing her as queen-lieutenant and governor, he placed her in a secondary, dependent role. Queens, Eiximenis believed, have a distinct and secondary status because they are female: [The queen] owes it to her husband at all times to conserve the peace in the kingdom and ensure swift, righteous, and clear justice to their peoples, and not under any circumstances act as a tyrant, but rather to show herself likable and dear to her people, and take counsel from a small group chosen from among them, and fearing God, and eschewing greed, and who are committed to the common good and not their own affairs.BNE: Ms. 92, f. 14v) In keeping with other late medieval devotional texts, Eiximenis' dictates that \\"the queen is to pray with humility, to kiss the ground before the image of Christ, to kneel, and to look at him with humility and reverence. Praying alone in a private room or chapel, at night or early in the morning, served not only to underline the humility and authenticity of devotion, but quite simply to ensure that she would not be interrupted.\\"Silleras-Fernandez, p. 125. Nuria Silleras-Fernandez, in Chariots of Ladies, suggests that the Scala Dei, and Maria de Luna's personal relationship with Eiximenis more generally, substantially shaped her queenship and subsequent reputation.Silleras-Fernandez, p. 125 Ultimately, she did launch the Observant Franciscan movement in the region of her domain. Silleras-Fernandez argues that \\"Eiximenis inspired Maria to cultivate became the kernel of her royal persona, or, as she preferred to call it in her letters, her 'queenly dignity' (dignitat reginal).\\" Furthermore, he \\"coached her on how to project an image that enabled her to exercise power without upsetting contemporary sensibilities regarding gender roles.\\"  Issue  Maria and Martin had four children; three of them died in childhood: *Martin I of Sicily *James (b. 1378) *John (b. 1380) *Margaret (b. 1384/1388)barcelona2  References  Bibliography  * Garcia Marsilla, J.

She grew up with three brothers who taught her how to play baseball. At age 10 she began playing organized softball, and a year later she joined a semi- professional team. She later became a top all-around athlete while in high school. At 17, she was invited to the 1945 spring training of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Before that, a player from Los Angeles Angels PCL team worked with her on playing baseball. Finally, she was signed to a contract and was allocated to the South Bend Blue Sox.1945 South Bend Blue Sox.

She joined a South Bend pitching staff headed by Charlotte Armstrong, and contributed with 13 victories, even though she allowed the most earned runs (67), tied the league season-record for the more balks (six), and posted a 0.80 strikeout-to-walk ratio (128-to-160). Her career highlight came against the host Kenosha Comets, when she achieved the rare feat of pitching complete game shutouts in both games of a doubleheader. Bird solidified herself in the baseball record books as one of three American professional pitchers to hurling two shutouts in a doubleheader.

Aims of the eLAC Action Plans # Act as a \\"metaplatform\\" for public-private action in order to coordinate the efforts of various sectors, with an end to generating synergies, avoiding the duplication of efforts, and strengthen regional projects, by means of cooperation and the exchange of best practices at a regional level. # Forge national strategies and initiatives in specific areas, establishing lines of action and defining indicators that illustrate the state of progress in the development of the information society. # Deepen knowledge on critical issues in order to support the definition, design, implementation and evaluation of policies. # Intermediate between the needs of the region's countries and the rhythm of global development, considering regional particularities within the context of the goals of the global community. Political background The eLAC Regional Action Plan is the outcome of an ongoing political process. In 1999, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) dedicated a series of high-level substantive meetings for their 2000 Period of Sessions to the theme \\"Development and international cooperation in the 21st century: the role of information technology in the context of a global knowledge-based economy.\\" In response, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, convened by the Government of Brazil and ECLAC in July 2000, signed the Florianopolis Declaration, which focused on the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) for development. In this initial phase, the region's leaders recognized the importance of adopting proactive public policies to strengthen insertion in the information society and to adequately confront the digital divide, upon declaring: \\"that allowing the evolution of the information and knowledge-based society to be guided solely by market mechanisms entails the risk of an amplification of the social gaps existing within our societies, the creation of new modes of exclusion, an increase in the negative aspects of globalization and a widening of the distances between developed and developing countries\\". As part of the international process of the World Summit on the Information Society, which took place in two phases (Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005), officials from the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean intensified their efforts to create a regional perspective on the development of information societies. Various meetings held between 2001 and 2003 by the regional network of the United Nations' Working Group on Information and Communications Technologies emphasized the importance of collaboration between stakeholders interested in confronting this challenge. Moreover, the Agenda for Connectivity in the Americas and Quito Plan of Action (August 2002) insisted on the need to design realistic national strategies and action plans. The B√°varo Declaration (January 2003) was an important step in the establishment of the fundamental principles for Latin America and the Caribbean in their transition towards information societies, given that they helped to identify the main characteristics of this phenomenon in the region. The repercussions of this document are noteworthy; in effect, since its approval, the analysis of Internet governance and open-source software were officially incorporated in the CMSI process for the first time, as issues that have come to take on great importance during this meeting and subsequent events. In the preparatory meetings for the second phase of WSIS, which took place in Quito in May 2005 and during the Regional Ministerial Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean in Rio de Janeiro in June 2005, many years of dialogue on the relationship between ICTs, economic growth and equity culminated in the Rio de Janeiro Commitment, which comprises the Action Plan for the Information Society in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as eLAC2007. The region has taken as its long-term strategic guide the Geneva Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit on the Information Society, which lays down targets to be met by 2015, together with the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. Building on the existing political consensus in the region, the governments of the countries comprising it put forward proposals at the meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the second phase of the Preparatory Committee for the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society for the development of an Action Plan for Latin America and the Caribbean for the 2005‚Äì2007 period (eLAC2007), intending that this should be the first step along the road to 2015. The second step was forged with the approval of the second Regional Action Plan (eLAC2010), which is embodied in the San Salvador Commitment, approved during the II Ministerial Conference on the Information Society, held in El Salvador, 6‚Äì8 February 2008. The most recent Digital Agenda for Latin America and the Caribbean has been approved in Cartagena, Colombia, May 2018. eLAC2020 is clearly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, and therefore expands its role in translating global ambitions into regional (which it had previous done for the Millennium Development Goals). Impact Evaluation and Monitoring One important and special character of the eLAC Action Plans is that it counts with a continuous process of evidence-based monitoring . This provides policy makers with statistical evidence to evaluate the impact and progress. UN ECLAC (as the technical secretariat of eLAC has been providing this service by providing accountability through the tracking of policy goals through hundreds of graphs and tables: * 2005: Benchmarking WSIS in LAChttps://www.cepal.org/es/node/26042 * 2005: Situating eLAC2007https://www.cepal.org/es/node/20629 * 2007: Monitoring eLAC2007https://www.cepal.org/es/node/25916 * 2010: Monitoring eLAC2010https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/2967-monitoreo-plan- elac2010-avances-desafios-la-sociedad-la-informacion-america * 2013: Monitoring eLAC2015https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/22588-monitoreo- plan-accion-elac2015-cuarta-conferencia-ministerial-la-sociedad-la * 2018: Monitoring eLAC2018 There were two main structural innovation in the original eLAC2007 Action Plan that distinguished it from other similar initiatives . * It exclusively had two kinds of goals: either objectively quantifiable (in absolute or relative numbers), or action-oriented (with clearly outlined next steps). This best practice that made assessment very straightforward. * It explicitly acted as a \\"metaplatform for public-private sector cooperation\\". Even so there were cash-loaded development projects in the region at the time, eLAC never had the ambition to create projects of its own, but rather to contribute with a coordination role among hands-on projects. For example, the regional e-Government Network (RedGeALC) led goal 15, the regional Cooperation of Advanced Networks (RedCLARA) figured in goal 10, and the regional Observatory for the Information Society (OSILAC) drove goal 26.

She moved to the White House in 1988, becoming Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs. In 1990, she moved to the United States Department of Defense as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter- American Affairs. On April 24, 1991, President of the United States George H. W.

The prince is best known for his famous oath before his execution on the orders of his father that he shall be reborn to fight against his father if he were innocent. Razadarit was concerned that the young prince would later raise a rebellion against him as he had driven the prince's mother Queen Tala Mi Daw to commit suicide, and feared that the young prince would one day avenge for his mother's death. The people of Hanthawaddy and the people of rival Kingdom of Ava widely believed that Prince Minye Kyawswa of Ava was the reincarnation of Baw Law Kyan Daw, fulfilling the prophecy of the oath. Execution Razadarit eventually ordered the execution of his own son at a young age. Razadarit was in Bassein (Pathein) when he ordered the execution of his eldest child, only about seven years old, who was in Pegu (Bago).Phayre 1873: 47‚Äì55 It was April 1390.According to the main Burmese chronicles Maha Yazawin (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 299) and Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 427), the prince was executed in 751 ME (28 March 1389 to 28 March 1390). But Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 195) and Yazawin Thit (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 429) give 752 ME (29 March 1390 to 28 March 1391). Since Minye Kyawswa was born in 752 ME, it means Bawlawkyantaw died in early 752 ME ( April 1390). The king's executioners took the prince to the Shwemawdaw Pagoda. The young prince was imprisoned for three days at the pagoda during which he was said to have reread the Abhidhamma (part of Buddhist scriptures).Harvey 1925: 114‚Äì115 According to chronicles, on the day of his execution, the young prince swore an oath that would enter into Burmese history: :I do not plot against my father. Neither is there any fault in me. My father and mother played together as children. When she grew to womanhood, he took her beauty and then cast her away. She was a king's daughter, but he used her like a slavewoman and drove her to an evil death... :... If I am guilty of treason by thought, word or deed, may I suffer in the fires of the nether regions for a thousand cycle times. If I am innocent, may I be reborn in the dynasty of Ava kings, and may I become the scourge of my father.Htin Aung 1967: 90‚Äì91Standard chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 299) and (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 427) say the prince wished to destroy the kingdom of Mons. Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 195) says the prince swore to fight his father (not the kingdom of Mons). Razadarit was greatly disturbed when he heard of the terrible oath. In the superstitious world of Burmese politics, he was alarmed when Shin Mi-Nauk, the wife of Prince Min Swe of Ava fetched to eat various foods from Lower Burma before she became pregnant.

He may be best known for his work in the field that would eventually be called Additive Combinatorics. Particularly notable was his \\"ingenious\\" application of the Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem to improve the best known lower bound for the sum- product problem. He also proved that any polynomial-time algorithm approximating the volume of convex bodies must have a multiplicative error, and the error grows exponentially on the dimension. With Micha Sharir he set up a framework which eventually led Guth and Katz to the solution of the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem.The Erd≈ës distance problem (See below.) Life After graduating from the mathematics program at Fazekas Mih√°ly Gimn√°zium (i.e., \\"Fazekas Mih√°ly high school\\" in Budapest, which is known for its excellence, especially in mathematics), Elekes studied mathematics at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. Upon completing his degree, he joined the faculty in the Department of Analysis at the university. In 1984, he joined the newly forming Department of Computer Science, which was being headed by L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz. Elekes was promoted to full professor in 2005. He received the Doctor of Mathematical Sciences title from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2001. Work Elekes started his mathematical work in combinatorial set theory, answering some questions posed by Erd≈ës and Hajnal. One of his results states that if the set of infinite subsets of the set of natural numbers is split into countably many parts, then in one of them, there is a solution of the equation A‚à™B=C. His interest later switched to another favorite topic of Erd≈ës, discrete geometry and geometric algorithm theory. In 1986 he proved that if a deterministic polynomial algorithm computes a number V(K) for every convex body K in any Euclidean space given by a separation oracle such that V(K) always at least vol(K), the volume of K, then for every large enough dimension n, there is a convex body in the n-dimensional Euclidean space such that V(K)>20.99nvol(K). That is, any polynomial-time estimate the volume of K must be inaccurate by at least an exponential factor. Not long before his death he developed new tools in Algebraic geometry and used them to obtain results in Discrete geometry, proving Purdy's Conjecture. Micha Sharir organized, extended and published Elekes's posthumous notes on these methods.On lattices, distinct distances, and the Elekes-Sharir framework, Javier Cilleruelo, Micha Sharir, Adam Sheffer, https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0242 Then Nets Katz and Larry Guth used them to solve (apart from a factor of (log n) 1/2 ) the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem, posed in 1946.

Plot Mike Kells is assigned by the State Department to fly to Salzburg and meet his old friend Sam Carew, who will pass a top-secret document to him on a particular train platform. A passenger on the Salzburg-bound plane, Joan Ross, takes a liking to Mike and expresses a desire to see him again. However, at the set meeting site, Sam ignores him because he is apparently being tailed by two men. Mike boards the same train and sits near a woman Sam seems to know. In a tunnel, Mike is shocked to see the two men throw Carew's body off the train. Col. Cagle and Sgt. Guelvada of the US Army tersely interrogate Mike as to what went wrong. They believe the woman's involved and order him to travel to Trieste to find her. Guelvada goes along. She is identified as Janine Betki, a singer and a possible Russian agent. Mike goes to a club where she once performed. He runs into Joan there instead. After a strange man slips Mike some information, the man tries to flee for safety but is murdered in a hit- and-run incident by a car which had almost killed Mike a moment before. Janine is located and explains to Mike that she not only worked with Carew but also loved him and spied on the Russians on his behalf. Still, the colonel insists Janine was a loyal Soviet agent by showing Mike the dossier on her efforts as a Russian spy, a dossier which was compiled by Carew himself. Joan then contacts Mike and claims a sniper tried to kill her. After he leaves, it is Joan who is revealed to be the Russian agent. Mike deduces that Carew hid microfilm in a wristwatch. He retrieves the watch from the pawn shop where she left it, only to have Joan try to take it from him at gunpoint before she is surprised and overpowered by the faithful American Sergeant. Meanwhile, a complication arises that no one anticipated because the pawnbroker had cleaned the watch and removed the film. After Mike is captured by the Soviets, Janine successfully bargains for both of their lives by agreeing to give the microfilm to them. In the end, the microfilm is recovered by the American authorities while Mike manages to meet with Janine in the presence of her Soviet spymaster in a compartment on a moving train, where he ultimately facilitates their escape to freedom.

Plot Race-car driver Gino Borgesa meets a ballerina, Nicole Laurent, whose pet poodle causes a crash at the track. She persuades an ex-lover to give Gino money for a new car. They begin a romance, although Gino warns her that his racing comes first. After winning a 1,000-mile race, Gino is hired by a successful racing team managed by Maglio, who is leery of Gino's reckless driving tactics but takes a chance on him at the urging of veteran driver Carlos Chavez. Nicole is troubled by Gino's unconcerned attitude about a mechanic accidentally killed at the track. A crash at a race in Brussels seriously injures Gino, whose leg is not amputated only because Nicole persuades doctors not to perform the operation. Once he recovers, Gino begins taking painkillers as well as unnecessary risks. His behavior, too, is out of control, causing him to insult Michel Caron, a young French driver who admires him. Nicole is offended, and the last straw comes when Gino relentlessly wins the final race of Carlos's career, even after Maglio instructed him to let Carlos have one last victory. In time, Gino's stature in racing begins to fall, and he is alone. He begs Nicole to return, but she is involved with Michel now. A contrite Gino returns to the track, where he willingly lets Michel speed past him.

The film is based on the 1976 novel of the same name written by Richard Peck. It originally aired on CBS on September 20, 1978.  Plot  16-year-old Gail Osborne is a typical high school student with a passion for photography. Six months ago, she and her parents moved from San Francisco to a smaller town due to her father Neil's claim the city was too dangerous following a burglary. Gail, a high spirited romantic, initially started dating classmate E.K. Miller, but he broke off their relationship because Gail was unwilling to sleep with him. Now, Gail is dating Steve Pastorinis, despite her overprotective mother's objections. After a while, she receives an anonymous letter which says: I am watching you. Gail thinks the letter is creepy, but is convinced by her best friend Allison Bremer that it is a practical joke from some student. However, when another note is found saying, \\"I know where you are I'm watching you you tramp I'm coming after you\\", and phone calls from a strange man laughing in a creepy way. Gail decides to warn her principal, who informs her it could be the act of her current or former boyfriend, someone she's rejected or perhaps someone she's knows that's hanging around. One day, Gail tries to tell her mother Anne about the stalking, but Anne is too busy to pay attention and blows Gail off. Therefore, Gail ditches school and heads to San Francisco to visit her father at work. There, she finds out her father has been fired. Back home, she confronts her mother with this, who demands her to keep silent so Neil will not feel ashamed. Gail realizes more serious matters are going on in her life and decides to no longer pay attention to the notes and phone calls. One day when she's late for class, there is another message sticking out of her locker. A black and white picture of herself that she took in photography class with the word \\"RAPE\\" all in red across her face. One night, she is babysitting the children of Jessica Hirsch, who is dating Gail's teacher Chris Elden. She receives a phone call from her boyfriend Steve Pastorinis, and he asks if he can come over after work and spend time together. Gail, relieved, says yes, and he tells her he'll be there soon. The phone rings again, thinking it's Steve she answers, but it's the same stalker, laughing hysterically asking: Are you in the house alone? Afraid, Gail locks the door and windows all around the house. Someone knocks on the front door. Excited to see Steve, Gail opens the door and sees it's Allison's boyfriend, Phil Lawver, who stopped by. Phil asks if Allison is around because she said she was going to come by, and Gail responds she isn't there. Phil then asks to use the phone to call Allison's house. Phil picks up the receiver and dials the number but then puts his finger on the receiving end to cancel the call, and then pretends to be on the phone with Allison's mother while pulling out a handkerchief wiping off the phone. Gail looks over and sees him wiping the phone and he looks back at her before dropping the phone on the ground. He looks at her and says, \\"I really had you fooled, didn't I?\\" Gail lets out a sigh of relief figuring he was pulling a prank on her. Phil then says in a raspy creepy voice \\"Are you in the house alone?\\" Phil reveals that it wasn't a prank and that he's been stalking her and knows everything about her. He then attacks her, forces her onto the ground, and proceeds to rape her. Afterwards, he runs out of the house. Due to the trauma, Gail is hospitalized and at first refuses to say that Phil raped her, knowing she won‚Äôt be believed. Instead, she claims it was all a blur. Another female officer comes in to ask if she can try to remember, and Gail continues to lie out of fear. The female officer leaves, but tells her that if she changes her mind, to call her at the station. She also mentions that if Gail doesn't give her a name, they have no case, and her attacker can do this to someone else. Fearing that some other girl might endure what she just went through, she tells the officer it was Phillip Lawver. Her father is outraged at Phil, but finds out they can not sue him because Phil's father is a close friend of the local judge. Gail is eventually encouraged by her teacher Malevich not to be afraid any longer and she returns to school. There, she finds out another girl is receiving the same creepy notes. Determined to stop Phil, she attempts to catch him on camera. Phil, however, is onto her and attempts to beat her up, but is caught by Steve. In the end, Phil pleads guilty to assault but is not charged with rape. He has since disappeared, and one rumor has it he is in a boarding school in New Hampshire.

Plot While Jack Brookfield (John Halliday) runs a gambling gathering at nighttime in his Kentucky house, his daughter Nancy (Judith Allen) is frequently visited by and becomes engaged to young Northern architect Clay Thorne (Tom Brown). His mother (Olive Tell), an old friend of Brookfield's, arrives from Baltimore to save her son from the vice of gambling, but when Brookfield shows her her son and his daughter in the garden, she is delighted. Brookfield announces to the gentlemen that for that evening the gambling is over early, due to a feeling he has. After everybody has left, Brookfield's old friend (and customer) Lew Ellinger (Richard Carle) proposes to play poker. But Brookfield answers he is not a gambler. Ellinger deals the cards anyway. To his astonishment, Brookfield tells him exactly what he has in his hands. When it is repeated a second time, Brookfield tells him that he cannot tell what cards he has if Ellinger doesn't look at them. When this second time he tells again the card Ellinger has, Ellinger asks Brookfield how he does it. Brookfield does not know how he does it, but he does not gamble because of this gift, which saddens Ellinger. Meantime, the police chief (Frank Sheridan) gathers his men to raid Brookfield's house. When they arrive, however, they can find no trace of gambling activity. After Nancy turns in for the night, Clay becomes terrified when he sees a cats-eye ring (collateral put up by Lew) on Brookfield's finger. This causes Brookfield to question Clay's manhood. Afterward, Brookfield receives a visit from Frank Hardmuth (Ralf Harolde). Hardmuth has a grudge against him and is determined to show that he is the boss of the town. When Hardmuth states he is good enough for Nancy, Brookfield punches him and tells him that one day a man will come in his office and shoot him. Clay overhears him. Brookfield tells him, after Hardmuth leaves, that his fear is absurd. He hypnotizes the young man without realizing it. Judge Martin Prentice (Guy Standing) is Brookfield's last visitor that night. Brookfield finds in him an understanding person concerning his gift. Prentice warns him to be more careful about hypnotizing people. Clay goes to Hardmuth's office and shoots him dead, without knowing what he is doing. His loved ones search for a defense attorney, but nobody takes hypnotism seriously or believes it is grounds for a defense. Finally, they think of Judge Prentice, who is retired, but would certainly understand how to manage the case. Prentice does not want to take the case, but the ghost of Margaret Price (Gertrude Michael), Mrs. Thorne's mother and Prentice's love, persuades him to change his mind. The trial goes badly for the defense; even the testimony of Dr. von Strohn (Ferdinand Gottschalk), an eminent expert in hypnosis, cannot turn the tide. Finally, in desperation, Prentice has Brookfield hypnotize the openly skeptical jury foreman (William Frawley) into shooting the district attorney (the gun has blanks). The jury reaches the verdict \\"not guilty\\", and Clay is a free man.

He also reportedly never lost over seven games per season while at Birmingham. All four brothers were on that team by 1908, and he beat Hall of Famer Joe Williams 1-0 in San Antonio, striking out the side with the bases loaded in the ninth inning.

The supporting cast features Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper. It is based on the novel The Hell Bent Kid by Charles O. Locke. Plot Ruthless cattle baron Hunter Boyd orders his riders to capture a former ranch-hand, Tod Lohman, suspected of murdering one of Boyd's sons, Shorty. The victim's brother, Otis Boyd, initiates a stampede to facilitate Lohman's capture, but Tod evades capture by driving the animals in an opposite direction. Later, Tod gets the drop on Otis's brother, Tom, who has been trailing him. Tod insists he did not kill Tom's brother, Shorty, and explains what did happen. Tod tells Tom to relay the truth to his family and sends him on his way. While trying one more time to kill Tod, Tom shoots the man's horse, instead, before retreating home. On foot, Tod collapses near a river bank. He is found by rancher Amos Bradley and his daughter Juanita, who provide food and shelter. Juanita takes a liking to Tod, who is searching for his missing father; he was raised by his mother, who instilled in him biblical principles and lessons. Tod departs the Bradley's, but is soon surrounded by Hunter Boyd and his men. In gratitude for not shooting Tom when he had the chance, Boyd permits Tod a horse and a four-hour head start, then resumes the chase. Tod rides into the town of Socorro, where he discovers that his father has died. He visits Amos Bradley's ranch. While there, Nita and he fall in love. He knows he must keep running, but hopes to return permanently. Hunter Boyd, Tom, and a member of the posse confront Bradley and wound the old man when he will not let them search his home for Tod. This proves the last straw for Tod, who aborts his plan to flee and takes on the Boyds in town. During the gunfight, as ordered by his father, Tom shoots a chandelier in an attempt to douse the lighting. Tom is engulfed by the resulting flames. Tod's instincts take over and he saves Tom's life. An appreciative Hunter Boyd thus calls off the vendetta. Cast *Don Murray as Tod Lohman *Diane Varsi as Juanita Bradley *Chill Wills as Amos Bradley *Dennis Hopper as Tom Boyd *R.G.

The actor then began work by \\"taking daily riding lessons to get in shape for the cowboy role.\\"Hopper, Hedda. \\"Don Murray Okays Script of Movie He Once Rejected.\\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times (September 4, 1957): p. 21. Dennis Hopper, who had trained as a Method actor, walked off the set of From Hell to Texas several times over disagreements with director Henry Hathaway, who would continually order Hopper to \\"get over there and hit your mark and say your lines like I tell ya.\\" After shooting on the film was completed, Hopper acquired the reputation of being \\"difficult.\\" He was dropped from his Hollywood contract and did not return to films again until 1965, when he appeared in The Sons of Katie Elder. Ironically, that film was also directed by Henry Hathaway.Hopper, Dennis. Dennis Hopper: Interviews. Ed. Nick Dawson. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2012. p. 202. Hathaway has described the editing of From Hell to Texas in an oral history edited by Rudy Behlmer and conducted by production designer Polly Platt. It describes the role of Barbara McLean, then the head of the editing department at 20th Century Fox. After Ms. McLean's son, Johnny Ehrin, took over editing chores on the film while Hathaway was already at work directing another film, the director returned to the studio to look at the completed work and was aghast at what he saw. He contacted McLean, who took a look at her son's editing and was equally horrified. So she and Hathaway spent an entire weekend, with virtually no rest, re-editing the film. Hathaway concludes the story by judging McLean's work approvingly. He recalls thinking that her editing had made his western \\"another movie. Just a complete other picture\\". Writer Wendell Mayes said he thought it was a \\"superb Western\\" and enjoyed working with Hathaway. Reception Bosley Crowther, film critic for the New York Times, called the film \\"a good, solid picture, not great in the class of High Noon, but full of continually lively action.\\" Furthermore, the critic praised R. G. Armstrong's performance as \\"first-rate.\\" Yet Crowther also noted that From Hell to Texas was ultimately indistinguishable from the innumerable TV- western serials that, in 1958, flooded network television's prime-time schedule. More recently, author John Howard Reid considered the film a disappointment, with \\"weak and uninteresting\\" characters. Moreover, Reid cited technical flaws such as \\"obvious day-for-night lensing and glaring process screen backdrops\\" Film historian Chris Langley has grouped From Hell to Texas with two other Henry Hathaway westerns, Nevada Smith (1965) and True Grit (1969) to form what the writer calls \\"Hathaway's Western revenge trilogy.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1958 films Category:1958 Western (genre) films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Henry Hathaway Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films scored by Daniele Amfitheatrof Category:Films with screenplays by Wendell Mayes Category:American Western (genre) films Category:American films ","title":"From Hell to Texas"},{"id":"26640862","text":"The Nashville Area Hispanic Chamber of Commerce is a chamber of commerce in Nashville, Tennessee, United States.

Casey and Miles help to save a group of white hunters ambushed in a Masai village. Later, Miles and Casey are nearly killed by a herd of charging elephants, led by a rogue elephant. Casey refuses to fire knowing Miles also won't shoot, but is not afraid. Casey bids Miles farewell and leaves Africa and Grant, who stays behind in the hopes of finding a new benefactor.

The film is adapted from Will James's 1930 novel, The Lone Cowboy. The film was produced, directed, and written by the team that delivered the Oscar-winning film True Grit. This was the second-to-last of the 65 films directed by Hathaway. Plot Clay Lomax is released from prison after serving seven years for robbing a bank. He goes looking for his former crime partner Sam Foley (James Gregory), a bank robber who shot Lomax in the back as they ran from the bank and left him to be arrested. Learning of his release, Foley hires a trio of young thugs--Pepe (Pepe Serna), Skeeter (John Davis Chandler), and Bobby Jay Jones-- (Robert F. Lyons) to track Lomax's movements. Lomax locates an old friend, Trooper (Jeff Corey), a former U.S. Army cavalry soldier, now confined to a wheelchair running a town saloon and offers him money for information about his ex-partner. The thugs catch up to Lomax at Trooper's saloon / hotel and force Alma (Susan Tyrrell), a prostitute / saloon girl working for the gruff but kindly old soldier, to spend the night with them. They wind up disturbing Clay from his sleep with his old girlfriend Emma (Rita Gam) with the racket in the neighboring room, and have an altercation in the corridor. Later Lomax meets a passing train at the whistle stop to meet an old lady companion who was bringing a large sum of money that she had held for him all these years. But surprisingly, the conductor Mr. Frenatore (Paul Fix) brings out a 7-year-old girl Decky Ortega (Dawn Lyn) who had accompanied the woman on her train journey; the woman had died a few days before in a distant town leaving the girl an orphan. He finally pulls the child off the train. The conductor hands him a wad of cash saying that if he hadn't retrieved and taken custody of the kid, the money would have gone towards her support when the railroad employee turned her over to a sheriff in the next large town on the line. Lomax tries to find someone to take care of Decky, but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the thugs mistreat and leave bruises on Alma, then vandalize the hotel/saloon as the old handicapped owner demands restitution. Led by Bobby Jay, they fatally shoot Trooper and rob the saloon, taking Lomax's money and Alma with them, before continuing to follow Lomax. Lomax returns, learning of Trooper's death and that he mentioned the location \\"Gun Hill\\" with his dying breath. During the following journey to Gun Hill, Lomax and stubborn little Decky bond closer, especially after he throws her in a stream to wash and hand scrub her, then gently dries and warms her by the campfire. She asks him if he is her father which he denies, but he knew her mother well and the paternal implication is clear. Another night, the gang of thugs attempt to attack Lomax in his camp, but he disarms them. When he finds out the purpose of their trailing mission, he tells them to go ahead and run back to Foley in Gun Hill and tell them that he is coming for him. Later, a rainstorm forces Lomax and Decky to take shelter at the cabin in the woods of a lonely widow woman named Juliana Farrell (Patricia Quinn), who quickly becomes infatuated with Lomax and offers to watch over Decky. The thugs then return later in the night and take them all prisoner. Bobby Jay gets drunk, tortures the young mother by using her son and saying he was going to shoot a target off his head. Later, he kills saloon girl Alma. Lomax manages to escape, with Bobby Jay accidentally killing his gang member Skeeter in the process. Bobby Jay grabs Decky and flees the house to find the other outlaw Pepe. When Pepe insults him outside having heard the shots inside, Bobby Jay kills him too, and Decky takes advantage of his distraction to escape in the night. Now alone, Bobby Jay rides ahead to warn Foley, and get his promised money, but kills him when he gets greedy seeing the amount of cash in Foley's safe. Foley tries to reach for a gun, and is shot dead. Bobby Jay is ambushed by Lomax, who arrives while Bobby is gathering his loot and surprises the murderer. Now enraged and seeking revenge for Trooper, Clay tortures Jay while demanding Decky's whereabouts. When he confesses that he has no idea where she is, Lomax places a cartridge on top of Bobby Jay's head, and tells him that either the cartridge will explode and kill him, or Bobby Jay will not be fast enough to quick draw his gun to kill Lomax. Bobby Jay tries to outdraw Lomax but cannot and is shot dead by the far more experienced gunslinger. Lomax leaves the money with Foley and Bobby Jay's bodies, tells the maid to go get the law, and then goes to find Decky back at Juliana's house.

Believing teaming with the director of True Grit, Henry Hathaway, along with the same producer (Hal B. Wallis) and screenwriter (Marguerite Roberts), would bring similar success, Peck started filming the project in 1970. As the film even followed a similar path - teaming a crusty gunfighter with a young girl for a companion - Peck deferred his usual salary for a percentage of the profits of the film. This allowed the production to come in on a tight budget of $1.19 million. The film was shot on location in Santa Fe-Los Alamos area of New Mexico between October 12 and December 2, 1970. Production wrapped on December 16. Release=Box office The film was released in Los Angeles on August 25, 1971. It was released in Sweden on August 16, 1971. Critical reception The film received negative reviews from a number of critics, especially in light of the blatant repetition of the formula seen in the earlier John Wayne film. Michael Kerbel from The Village Voice wrote that Shoot Out did have some semblance of True Grit, \\"'but the humor and charm are missing and what remains - a predictable revenge story - becomes tiresome.'\\" Roger Greenspun of The New York Times observed that the film was \\"no more than another variation of the eternal tale of the Westerner (Gregory Peck) released from prison who seeks revenge on the pal who betrayed him but is himself pursued by a hired gang of maniacal killers until a showdown in which everybody get his except Peck, who unaccountably gets marriage and a family.\\"Greenspun, Roger (October 14, 1971). \\"Shoot Out\\". The New York Times. 53. Others remarked about the slump in Gregory Peck's career: Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"served 'mostly as a glum reminder of the inadequate use'\\" of the Hollywood star, while Paine Knickerbocker of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote \\"'Peck, m'boy, what the hell are you doing here?'\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film zero stars out of four and counted five scenes in which an overhead microphone appeared in a shot, writing that there was \\"no excuse for such shoddy film making.\\" He described the script as \\"nearly as unprofessional,\\" being \\"almost a replay\\" of True Grit.Siskel, Gene (July 20, 1971). \\"Shoot Out\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 4. In later years Quentin Tarantino said \\"the most interesting part of the picture is how it predates Peter Bogdanovich‚Äôs Paper Moon by three years. In both movies a shady man is left, against his will, in charge of the daughter of a deceased former flame who he may or may not be the father.\\" Tarantino said the movie was \\"Nothing special, but by the time it was over, I enjoyed it and was glad I saw it.\\" Home media release The film was released on DVD on October 1, 2002.

Individuals of Aulacephalodon are commonly found in the Lower Beaufort Group of the Karoo Supergroup of South Africa and Zambia. Rising to dominance during the Late Permian, Aulacephalodon were the dominant terrestrial vertebrate herbivores until they became extinct during the Triassic. No living relatives of Aulacephalodon exist today. Two species have been named, the type species, A. bainii, and a second species, A. peavoti. However, debate exists among paleontologists if A. peavoti is a true member of the genus Aulacephalodon. Therefore, a majority of the information known about Aulacephalodon is in reference to discoveries about A. bainii. The name Aulacephalodon combines the Greek words aulak- (aulax), meaning \\"a furrow\\", kephale, meaning \\"head,\\" and odon, meaning tooth. Together, Aulacephalodon means \\"furrow-head tooth.\\" The species Aulacephalodon bainii was named in honor of Andrew Geddes Bain (1797-1864), a Scottish geologist and road engineer who is credited with discovering the first dicynodont skull in South Africa. Aulacephalodon belong to the family Geikiidae, a family of dicynodonts generally characterized by their short, broad skulls and large nasal bosses.Kammerer, Christian F., and Kenneth D. Angielczyk. \\"A proposed higher taxonomy of anomodont therapsids.\\" Zootaxa 2018 (2009): 1-24. Two autamorphies used to define Geikiidae include (1) the posterior portion of the zygomatic arch thickened and/or downturned; (2) the labial fossa present. Both features are found in Aulacephalodon and allow for suggestions to be made about possible sexual dimorphism evident in A. bainii. Among certain anomodont therapsids, Aulacephalodon and Pelanomodon are distinguished from their related genera, Oudenodon and Rhachiocephalus by the specialization of their biting mechanism and the relative size of their nasal and prefrontal bosses.Keyser, A. W. \\"A re-evaluation of the systematics and morphology of certain anomodont Therapsida.\\" (1972). Aulacephalodon and Pelanomodon bit using the transverse anterior tips of the jaws, while Oudenodon and Rhachiocephalus bit using the sides of their horn covered jaws. The difference in jaw morphology between the two groups of genera is a notable dichotomy among these related therapsids. Aulacephalodon was unique among dicynodonts and its related therapsids because members of this genus were one of the only dicynodonts to possess canine tusks.  Description  Life restoration of A. bainii.Aulacephalodon is considered to be medium-sized relative to other dicynodont species, unique to other dicynodont species due to the canine tusks they possessed. Fossilization tends to have preserved only skulls and complete or fragmented bones of Aulacephalodon bainii, requiring paleontologists to use the unique features of the cranium when identifying specimens believed to belong to the genus. Aulacephalodon had short, broad skulls with a recorded range of 135 mm to 410 mm.Tollman, S. M., F. E. Grine, and B. D. Hahn. Ontogeny and sexual dimorphism in Aulacephalodon (Reptilia, Anomodontia). South African Museum, 1980. Comparison of juvenile and mature individuals suggest that Aulacephalodon demonstrated a positive allometric growth pattern for their cranial features and a negative allometric growth pattern for their tusk and orbit size as ontogenetic age increases. Disproportionately large eyes in juveniles of a species is considered a characteristic of higher vertebrates. Diagnostic features of Aulacephalodon include (1) the size of their nasal bosses, (2) the shape and articulation of cranial bones, and (3) the length-breadth ration of the skull. The most complete restoration of Aulacephalodon is a skeleton of A. peavoti from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.A set of footprints was found in the Teekloof Formation of the Beaufort Group by C.S. MacRae (1990), believing to have been made by either Aulacephalodon or the related Rhachiocephalus.MacRae, C. S. \\"Fossil vertebrate tracks near Murraysburg.\\" Cape Province: Palaeontologia africana 27 (1990): 83-88. Biostratigraphy placed the formation that contained the tracks within the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone. Two sets of tracks were found, most likely belonging to two different individuals, with a pace approximately 600‚Äì650 mm in length. The organism that made the tracks was a large, and heavily padded, homopodus quadruped with a short tail. The tracks had a width of 800 mm, which when combined with the short stride length suggests Aulacephalodon, or Rhaciocephalus, was an inefficient walker.  Discovery and naming = Origins of Aulacephalodon  Controversy over the number of species belonging to the genus Aulacephalodon has existed since the first specimens were discovered. The majority of specimens found were fragments, making proper diagnosis difficult for many of the specimens. Owen (1844) first described members of this genus as Dicynodon bainii, with five more species of dicynodont being discovered in subsequent years. Seeley (1898) divided Dicynodon into two subgenera and created the subgenus Aulacephalodon, suggesting all dicynodonts with a short snout and wide skull should be included in the subgenus. Two additional dicynodont species were discovered by Broom in 1912 and 1913. Broom (1921) also proposed a new subgenus of Dicynodon, Bainia, to describe tusked members of Dicynodon. When Broom finally recognized Seeley's subgenus, Aulacephalodon, as a valid genus in 1932. However, the spelling was altered to Aulacocephalodon. The incorrect genus Aulacocephalodon was used for many years until the correct spelling was pointed out by Keyser (1969). At least 17 species have been described as members of Aulacephalodon, however it is noted many of the features used to distinguish between the different species are size-dependent and highly susceptible to distortion. This has resulted in Aulacephalodon bainii being recognized as the type species of the genus, with the previous 17 species described as synonymous members of the species at various stages of growth.  Aulacephalodon bainii and Aulacephalodon peavoti  When Aulacephalodon peavoti was first described, the cranium of one specimen was compared to Aulacephalodon bainii to determine if A. peavoti can accurately be described as Aulacephalodon. The most distinct difference between A. bainii and A. peavoti is that specimens of A. peavoti are not found to possess tusks, which is a notable feature of A. bainii and Aulacephalodon. A. peavoti is also found to have a wider and more upright scapula blade compared to A. bainii, with deeper fossa on the proximal end of the scapula. While both species share some similar post-cranial features, there are numerous differences in the shapes of various girdle and forelimb elements prevents paleontologists from definitively recognizing A. peavoti as a member of Aulacephalodon.  Paleobiology = Diet  Aulacephalodon skulls show the transverse anterior tip of their short snout is reinforced by the palatal ridges and ridges on the snout, resulting in biting action restricted to the tip of their jaws. The restricted jaw motion and presence of a horny beak structure suggests that Aulacephalodon were herbivores. Based on the arid climate of the Cistecephalus Zone, Aulacephalodon is thought to have fed on the stems of woody plants present in the region. The most commonly occurring plants in the region, Schizoneura and Phyllotheca, would have been available to Aulacephalodon to feed on. Tollman et al. (1980) suggests that as a function of their ontogenetically increasing size, the breadth of their occupied niche increased throughout their life that resulted in changes to the size and type of food Aulacephalodon obtained. A similar phenomenon is observed in modern genera Alligator and Crocodylus.  Sexual dimorphism  261x261pxTollman et al. (1980) suggests that the nasal bosses in the skulls of collected Aulacephalodon specimens provide the most compelling evidence of sexual dimorphism in Aulacephalodon fossils. Morphological studies found that the sizes of the nasal bosses of collected specimens can be categorized into three different size ranges, with specimens possessing the largest sized nasal bosses assumed to be mature males. Female Aulacephalodon were found to be specimens with weakly developed nasal bosses. Specimens that were thought to represent mature males also had larger craniums with a thicker squamosal at the border of the zygomatic arch. Female specimens showed no thickening in the zygomatic arch. The canine tusks also appear to be longer and further apart in male specimens. Tollman et. all suggests sexual dimorphism existed in Aulacephalodon as a means of sexual selection and as a display mechanism. Important limitations to this analysis are that no specimen showed entirely male or female characters and many of the specimens used were characterized as immature juveniles. Possible explanations for this observation are that non- dimorphic characters present in the crania effectively mask the sexual dimorphism characters, or sexual dimorphic characters were not present in the fossils due to a lack of measurable characters.  Paleoecology  Aulacephalodon specimens have been found in both the Madumabisa Mudstone \\"Formation\\" of Zambia and the Cistecephalus zone sediments of South Africa. Though geographically different localities, the specimens found at both locations are not found to be morphologically distinct from each other. The terrain of the Cistecephalus zone is thought to be a lowland composed of vast floodplains, with many traversing streams that crossed the landscape.Yemane, K., and K. Kelts. \\"A short review of paleoenvironments for Lower Beaufort (Upper Permian) Karoo sequences from southern to central Africa: A major Gondwana Lacustrine episode.\\" Journal of African Earth Sciences (and the Middle East) 10.1-2 (1990): 169-185. The climate of the Beaufort Group during the Late Permian was semi-arid, with seasonal rainfall.Smith, R. M. H. \\"A review of stratigraphy and sedimentary environments of the Karoo Basin of South Africa.\\" Journal of African Earth Sciences (and the Middle East) 10.1-2 (1990): 117-137. While the overall climate of the Cistecephalus zone was not suitable for diverse environments, this zone was the height of genetic diversity of dicynodonts. Aulacephalodon occupied over 86% of the rich localities of the Cistecephalus zone, suggesting the habitat during this time was extremely suitable for Aulacephalodon. Recent biostratigraphy of the Beaufort Group has marked the lower boundary of the Cistecephalus assemblage zone by the first appearance of Aulacephalodon and the first appearance of Cistecephalus.van der Walt, Merrill, et al. \\"A new GIS-based biozone map of the Beaufort Group (Karoo Supergroup), South Africa.\\" (2010). This more specific boundary is the result of a refined biozonation map and new technology that allows for more accurate geographic information data (GIS).  Possible explanation for extinction  Some paleontologists suggest that the end-Permian tetrapod extinctions, including Aulacephalodon, may have been caused by lowered atmospheric oxygen concentrations, resulting in both environmental and organismal hypoxia. The increase in size of the internal nares and secondary palate would decrease the respiratory efficiency of large anomodont therapsids, such as Aulacephalodon. Comparison of Triassic and late- Permian therapsids shows an increase in separation between the buccal and nasal cavities and larger internal nares in Triassic therapsids, demonstrating an increased efficiency of oxygen transport in a lower-oxygen environment.

A few ruins remain from the Roman occupation but the most significant contributions over the centuries have been the country's castles and churches. Today there is a veritable architectural boom as Luxembourg's economic prosperity provides a basis for developments in the financial, EU and cultural sectors with a number of world-class buildings. History The architecture of Luxembourg appears to have its origins in the 1st or 2nd century BC when the Treveri, a prosperous Celtic tribe, developed an oppidum on Titelberg in the south-western corner of the country.Ralph M.

Initially designed as a fort, a square tower, a kitchen, a chapel and living rooms were added around 1100. During the 12th century, a new tower containing living quarters was built together with a prestigious new decagonal chapel. So as to impress the House of Luxembourg, the counts of Vianden constructed a new two-storey palace measuring 10 by 13 metres at the beginning of the 13th century, attaching it to the chapel by means of a magnificent gallery.

It is the 19th and penultimate volume of the Cadfael Chronicles, first published in 1992. It was adapted for television in 1998 by Carlton Media for ITV. Heavy rains flood the river which in turn floods the Abbey, threatening the precious reliquary of Saint Winifred. When the waters recede, the saint is gone, beginning a long search with tangled motives, including a murder that challenges the monks. This novel was well-received when it was published. Some commented on the finely wrought pose, and the author's ability to bring the reader to another time, making that time vividly alive. Another says the plot is \\"Less predictable and far more complex\\" than the prior novels in this series. Introduction to plot On 16 September 1144, Geoffrey de Mandeville's reign of terror in the Fens comes to an end when Geoffrey succumbs to an infection, brought on by a minor graze from an arrow. King Stephen had worked for a year to confine the marauding within a ring of forts and castles. In the heat of August, the one-time Earl of Essex went out without his chain mail and helmet at Burwell, northeast of Cambridge, where an archer's arrow reached its target. Besides being stripped of his lands by King Stephen, he and his eldest son were excommunicate for his seizure of Ramsey Abbey, which he used as his headquarters. There was no place for him to be buried, so rejected was he from England and his religion. Empress Maud gave the title back to the younger namesake son, but she could not grant the lands ‚Äì a fairly empty gesture. The rest of England was relieved as they learned by the passing of small bands of brigands looking for places to lay low, that they could again venture out without fear of seizure or murder by his organised band of brigands and marauders. As de Mandeville is dying, his allies who hope to mend fences wrote grants returning church property to its owners, including Ramsey Abbey. Before the end of 1144, Abbot Walter gets word he again has an Abbey to lead in the Fens. He sends word to collect his prior and sub-prior, and ask all the monks to return, to rebuild their home after more than a year away. The devastation is so extensive, the brothers not only begin work themselves, but also reach out to their fellows in other Benedictine monasteries in England for aid. Plot summary Two visitors from the now reviving Ramsey Abbey arrive in February 1145. Sub-prior Herluin and young Brother Tutilo request alms and aid in restoring their abbey. The Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and the people of Shrewsbury respond generously. Herluin seeks Sulien Blount at Longner Manor. Sulien will not rejoin as a monk. The family gives coppice wood for rebuilding. Lady Donata, Sulien's ailing mother, has the pleasure of hearing beautiful music from young Brother Tutilo. She donates her personal jewellery for Ramsey Abbey. Also staying at the Abbey is a successful Proven√ßal troubadour, R√©my of Pertuis, his groom and a singer. The Sheriff cries the warning that the River Severn is rising rapidly. A chaotic scene develops as the flood continues to rise after dark, as items of value are moved without benefit of lamps or candles within the Abbey buildings by monks and guests, and the cart for Ramsey Abbey is loading to leave. Herluin and Tutilo ride out to Worcester. When the flood subsides, in place of Saint Winifred's reliquary they find a wrapped piece of timber, the same size and heft, showing this to be a planned theft. The Sheriff and Prior Robert are dispatched to meet Herluin for what he knows. James of Betton returns to the Abbey more than a week after the cart set out, with the news that cart did not make it all the way to Ramsey Abbey ‚Äì the same news Nicol delivers to Herluin in Worcester. Nicol leads them to the place of the ambush. The reeve finds the reliquary in Ullesthorpe, where the brigands dumped it, and carries it to safety at Huncote, home of the Earl of Leicester. The Sheriff, the Prior and the sub-prior explain the story of the reliquary to the Earl. Herluin and Prior Robert explain this loss and rediscovery as the saint's own actions. Earl Robert sees the competition between them for it, and lightheartedly makes his claim, as it was found safe on his land. Earl Robert joins them in carrying it the long journey home in state. Cadfael finds Aldhelm, who moved the reliquary at the request of a monk. Brother Jerome eavesdrops on Hugh and Cadfael speaking about this visit, expecting Aldhelm to confirm Tutilo as the one who put the reliquary on the wagon. B√©nezet, the groom, overhears Jerome talking with Prior Robert, and shares the word with Daalny, the singer, who tells Tutilo. Jerome is not seen that evening. Aldhelm does not appear at the agreed time. After Lauds, Tutilo returns, deeply shaken, after tripping over a dead man in the dark on his return to the Abbey from another visit to Longner Manor. At dawn, Cadfael and Hugh confirm the dead man is Aldhelm. He was stunned by a hit on the head with a piece of fallen wood; next his head was smashed by a large stone, which was carefully replaced. Hugh Beringar, Radulfus, Prior Robert, Cadfael, Sub-prior Herluin, and Earl Robert gather. Tutilo confesses that he did take the saint, as she encouraged him to help Ramsey Abbey in this way. He had no part in this murder. Tutilo is put in a penitential cell of the Abbey. There remain three claims to possession of the saint in her reliquary. The earl wants an unbiased judge. Radulfus proposes a method. Sulien Blount arrives after Compline, requesting Tutilo for his mother who will not last the night. Radulfus agrees, sending Tutilo under guard. He sings for her as she quietly dies. He returns before dawn on a day in early March, with the gift of a psaltery and words of advice on the needs of a troubadour. The four conduct the sortes Biblicae, placing the book of the gospels on Saint Winifred's reliquary in front of the monks. Each verse is accepted as the saint telling them where the reliquary of Saint Winifred belongs. Radulfus :The last shall be first, and the first last. Matthew Ch 20 verse 16 Earl Robert :Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, thither ye cannot come. John Ch 7 verse 54 Father Herluin :I tell you, I know you not, whence you came. Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity‚Ä¶ Luke Ch 13 verse 27 Prior Robert :Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. John Ch 15 verse 16 The breeze in the chapel turns the pages :And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death. Matthew Ch 10 verse 21 They agree that the saint stays on her altar at Shrewsbury Abbey. Cadfael dares not explain his verse to Earl Robert. The sober last verse causes them to turn to the monks for their aid. Jerome unexpectedly confesses to the murder. He describes his actions up to striking Aldhelm on the head with a piece of wood in the dark, then leaving upon discovering it was not Tutilo as he anticipated. Jerome wails out his pain in the second penitentiary cell. Daalny lets Tutilo out of his cell. Herluin is enraged; the Earl is not bothered. Daalny says that someone here is a thief. B√©nezet realises she means him; he flees on someone else's horse. They find two surprises in his saddle bags. One is the bag of silver coins and Lady Donata's gold jewellery meant for Ramsey Abbey. It never left Shrewsbury Abbey. The other is a laundered shirt, with blood stains on it. B√©nezet killed Aldhelm, waited for him, fearing that Aldhelm might have seen him take the alms out of the coffer the night of the flood. Hugh's men hold B√©nezet for murder. The Earl asks for Daalny to be fetched from Saint Winifred's chapel. She is gone. The Earl seems to expect this. R√©my mourns her loss, but is very pleased to be part of the Earl's household. Hugh and Cadfael are relieved that the seals of the reliquary were never opened. Cadfael is pleased that Tutilo and Daalny have joined for a new free life for both, and impressed that Donata, finally free from her years of pain, was the one who read the lad aright.

Woodson High School, Fairfax, VA > Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc. Setting in history This novel is set in several locations in England. The story is set in Shrewsbury, located in Shropshire, England; briefly in Worcester Cathedral; and at Huncote, a manor of Robert, Earl of Leicester, not far from Ullesthorpe. Some scenes were at Longner Manor, east and south from the Abbey, crossing the Severn at a ferry location, near modern Uffington and shown clearly on the map titled Shrewsbury and Environs in the printed book. These were real places in the twelfth century, and now. The troubador R√©my was from a city in the south of France populated then and now, Pertuis, an area where troubadors may have started. It occurs during the Anarchy, which began when King Stephen's claim to the throne was disputed by his cousin Empress Maud in 1138. With the help of her ally and half-brother Robert of Gloucester, the two sides fought since that year. After all this time, no resolution was in sight and England suffered much while the attention of the king was focussed on fighting to keep his crown. The story begins with the death of Geoffrey de Mandeville. The Anarchy and Geoffrey de Mandeville The start of Geoffrey de Mandeville's story was told, in this series of novels, in The Potter's Field, the 17th Chronicle of Brother Cadfael. After King Stephen accused him of treason, revoked his title as Earl of Essex and took away his lands, Geoffrey de Mandeville responded by taking over the Ramsey Abbey in the Fens in East Anglia. This became the headquarters for his rampaging band of marauders for over a year. King Stephen built a ring of castles as his bases to contain the marauding, but could never draw him into a direct battle. Instead, de Mandeville's life was ended by a chance arrow shot from one of those castles at Burwell, on a hot August day when the one-time earl mistakenly removed his helmet and upper chain mail. The wound from the arrow led to an infection, fatal to him a month later on 16 September 1144. He had been excommunicated for his taking of Ramsey Abbey, such that only the Pope in person could revoke it. He died unshriven, with no legal place to bury him in England. Some of the Knights Templar did put his remains to rest at a site where the Temple Church in London was later built (in 1185) and somewhat ironically near the center of law and lawyers in London. His accomplices in burning homes, burning or stealing crops, killing local residents, and pillaging the stolen property of the church, could not keep their hold on the Fens without his leadership. Those who joined up as pure bandits themselves scattered, hoping to find safe harbour and new victims elsewhere. One such band may have been the thieves of the horses and cart in the novel. The allies of Geoffrey de Mandeville who sought some reconciliation after his death moved quickly to record writs returning the stolen properties back to the church. Word of this change travelled slowly to the people of the area, and to Abbot Walter of Ramsey Abbey. By the end of 1144, he called back his prior, sub- prior and the monks, to begin a huge task of rebuilding their home, then reviving their estates for agriculture. Two months after Abbot Walter returned to his Abbey, he dispatched monks to request help from neighbouring Abbeys, as far as Shrewsbury, where the main plot of The Holy Thief begins. Earl Robert of Leicester Earl Robert was a real person in history, quite involved in King Stephen's fortunes. Robert and his brother Waleran, twin sons of Robert, Count of Meulan who held lands and title in England and in France, supported Stephen in battle early on, but at this story, are in a difficult position. Waleran, whose title came from the lands he inherited in France and Normandy, had to come to terms with Geoffrey of Anjou, husband of Empress Maud and father of her son Henry, later King Henry II of England. Geoffrey of Anjou had consolidated his holdings in Anjou and Normandy, becoming a major force there that Waleran was forced to recognise, as Stephen had lost his position in Normandy. Waleran did not overtly support the Empress on English soil, but was constrained from overt support of King Stephen. Robert, in England, was similarly constrained, though he had his own title and lands primarily in England. Robert, living in England, did not have his loyalty questioned, but his twin brother, living in Normandy, did, though there was no difference in their true attachments. Robert used this time to keep the peace on his own lands as much as he could, and gain lands from his neighbour, Earl Ranulf of Chester. When Robert of Gloucester died in 1149, Robert of Leicester joined the movement for the earls in England to make private peace treaties, as suggested in his conversation with Sheriff Hugh Beringar in the novel.Peters, Ellis The Holy Thief 1992 Chapter Ten Earl Robert is described as a man of education and culture. In the reign of King Henry II, Robert became the first chief justiciar of England who was also the King's chief minister. He held this position for fourteen years, earning him much respect for his administration of the law. This reputation seemed to be the basis for many conversations between the Earl and the clerics in this novel. The Abbeys Characters in this novel travelled extensively, mainly from Abbey to Abbey. First, Herluin and his party walk from Ramsey Abbey. Abbot Radfulfus of Shrewsbury Abbey gives them horses for their journey to the abbeys at Evesham, Pershore and Worcester. The Sheriff and Prior Robert ride out to Worcester to meet Herluin's party. The five men who took the cart load of alms meant for Ramsey Abbey reached Ullesthorpe. Two walked back to Shrewsbury; two walked on to Ramsey Abbey; and one walked to Worcester. The party at Worcester then proceeded on horseback to Ullesthorpe, whence they are directed to Huncote. One lay servant is left to walk on his own from Worcester to Shrewsbury, which he did, in time to join Herluin for the return to Ramsey Abbey. Earl Robert joins them, with a proper carriage for the reliquary, in the journey back to Shrewsbury. The Earl rides back to Huncote with his party, escorting Herluin and his lay servants that far. Herluin will make the rest of the way to Ramsey Abbey without that welcome escort. Using modern roads, the distance from Ramsey Abbey to Shrewsbury is 135 miles; a route through Ullesthorpe adds 10 miles to that distance. In The Potter's Field, it took Sulien Blount a week to complete this walk. From Shrewsbury to Ullesthorpe is about 80 miles, and from Shrewsbury to Worcester is 50 miles. From Ullesthorpe to Worcestor is nearly 65 miles, walked by Nicol. Worcester to Huncote is about 70 miles. The journey back to Shrewsbury is nearly 90 miles, following a more northerly route. Thus does time pass from February into March for the events of the novel to transpire. Troubadours and Sortes Biblicae William IX of Aquitaine portrayed as a knight on a chansonnier, troubadour who first composed poetry on returning from the Crusade of 1101 The Middle Ages saw the start of troubadours across Europe. These were learned men who composed poems and songs, and performed them on the musical instruments of the day for the nobility. Troubadours travelled with their talents, like R√©my of Pertuis in this novel, and as Lady Donata suggested that Tutilo should do. They would reside in the household of one nobleman for a period of time. Depiction of a woman playing a portative organ (detail from a painting in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich). The bellows can be seen to the right of the pipes. The word troubadour has its origins in an old language of Provence and Languedoc, in the area where the langue d'Oc language was long ago used (Occitania or lo Pais d'Oc, the Oc Country). Songs of chivalry and romantic love were common, along with satire and some vulgar humour. The troubadours made use of their clerical education in the writing of songs. Some go so far in our modern era to claim the works of the troubadours were the origins of literature. Psaltery of the 14th century from the book: De Arythmetica, De Musica by M. Servinius Boetius. The instrument is typically held before the chest with the hands under the curves. The harp and the psaltery were two of the musical instruments of the day. The mandora, rebec, portative organ, lute or oud, flutes and panflutes were also used, and mentioned in the novel. Lady Donata's gift of a psaltery pleased and amazed Tutilo, and prepared him for the first steps of becoming a troubadour himself, per her advice. The sortes Biblicae described in the novel was a method of fortune-telling used for many ages, and in civilisations before medieval England. The users choose important writers, in this story, the authors of the four Gospels, as the source of phrases or sentences that might hint at the future, or the resolution of a problem. One selects a verse at random, then applies it to the present situation, as Abbot Radulfus suggests for resolving the true home for the reliquary. The book chosen was not a complete bible, as those were rarely copied before the printing press. Instead, important sections were copied. It is sometimes called Sortes Sanctorum or bibliomancy. The verses selected by the author move the story right along. The first one, selected by Radulfus, says that the next person of the four of them to choose a verse should be Earl Robert, the last to enter the story of the reliquary. His selection reveals the paradox of this reliquary; the Earl suspects a paradox but does not learn what it is from Brother Cadfael, the only one in the chapel who knows. The next, chosen by Herluin, tells him he has no business with the reliquary. Prior Robert's selection confirms it belongs in Shrewsbury. The last selection, selected by the breeze in the chapel, is marked by blackthorn blossoms that fell from Brother Cadfael's clothing as he looked at the Bible before the Mass. Prior Robert is pleased by the blossoms, recalling the hawthorn blossoms around the clothing of Brother Columbanus in Wales, just before the monks of Shrewsbury took their saint home seven years earlier. It is a troubling quote in a house of brothers with an unsolved murder, leading to the confession of part of what happened to the murdered man. It was an intriguing way to resolve a dispute, relying heavily on the deep faith of all the parties in the written words of their religion.

The Council reiterated the importance it attached to the Accordos de Paz and the continued presence of the United Nations in the country, welcoming the progress in talks between the Government of Angola and UNITA held in the Zambian capital Lusaka. UNITA was urged to accept the results of the 1992 elections, noting that future decisions made on Angola would depend on the political will of both parties to achieve peace. The efforts of neighbouring states and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) were welcomed. However, concern was expressed at the continuing hostilities and the effect on the civilian population, which emphasised the need for a ceasefire. Overall, the Council noted, the humanitarian situation in Angola had improved though in some areas the situation remained serious. Both parties were urged to honour their commitments, attain an effective ceasefire immediately and to reach a peace settlement, demanding that all military operations cease. After extending the stationing of UNAVEM II, the Council declared its readiness to authorise an increase in the peacekeeping mission to its previous level of 350 military observers, 126 police observers and 14 military medical staff with an appropriate number of international and local civilian staff. Any actions which hindered the delivery of humanitarian assistance and endangered the lives of humanitarian workers was condemned, while the international community was urged to provide assistance in this regard. Given the ongoing negotiations between the Angolan government and UNITA, no new measures would be imposed against UNITA. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to keep the Council informed on developments in the talks in Lusaka, Zambia, as well as on the military and humanitarian situation in Angola in a report to be submitted no later than 4 April 1994.

Because many black people have hair with tighter and smaller curls than people of other races, unique hair styles have developed. In addition to this, many black hairstyles have historical connections to African cultures.  African origins  Since the beginning of African civilizations, hairstyles have been used to convey messages to greater society. As early as the 15th century, different styles could \\"indicate a person's marital status, age, religion, ethnic identity, wealth and rank within the community.\\"Byrd, Ayana D., and Lori L. Tharps. Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America. New York: St. Martin's, 2001, p. 2. Hair maintenance in traditional Africa was aimed at creating a sense of beauty. \\"A woman with long thick hair demonstrated the life force, the multiplying power of profusion, prosperity...a green thumb for raising bountiful farms and many healthy children\\", wrote Sylvia Ardyn Boone, an anthropologist specializing in the Mende culture of Sierra Leone.Byrd, Ayana D., and Lori L. Tharps. Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America. New York: St. Martin's, 2001. In Yoruba culture in West Africa, people braided their hair to send messages to the gods. The hair is the most elevated part of the body and was therefore considered a portal for spirits to pass through to the soul. Because of the cultural and spiritual importance of hair for Africans, the practice of having their heads involuntarily shaved before being sold as slaves was in itself a dehumanizing act. \\"The shaved head was the first step the Europeans took to erase the slaves‚Äô culture and alter the relationship between the African and his or her hair.\\"  Diaspora  Black hairstyles have transformed over time, but their origins are rooted in purpose and livelihood. Before there were boundaries dividing Africa into states and countries through colonization, the continent was divided into kingdoms. Ancient African custom was for those who inhabited the kingdoms were a part of complex system of tribe and clan affiliations that were unique to their identity and personhood. During the 15th century, the way in which clan members wore their hair has a multitude of means. It was used as messaging system to communicate within and outside of their clan to convey their associations. Hair was biography tell a person‚Äôs age, martial status, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, surname, health status and geographic origin. One example is dreadlocks. Dreadlocks from the Himba tribe of Northwestern Namibia indicates one‚Äôs age, life stage, and marital status. The tribe lives in the northwestern region of Namibia. A combination of ground ochre, goat hair, and butter are used as well as hair extensions when weaving to styling their dreadlocks. This hairstyle has several meanings that communicate information women of the tribe specifically. Dreadlocks worn down in their front of the face represent girls going through puberty while dreadlocks tied back are worn by women looking to marry, in order to show their face. Erembe headdresses are a symbol of status worn by new mothers and married women. Hair was a marker of what clan someone belonged to and the styling was only entrusted to relatives for fear of enemies bring ill-will to the person. Hair was considered divine because was it at the top if the head so for someone to touch it they must be loyal to you. Members of the Wolof, Mende, Mandinka, Yoruba, Funlani, Igbo, and Ashanti all had different hairstyles that communicated who they were that connected them to their people, culture, history, and heritage. Those same tribes were dismantled and dispersed when the Middle Atlantic Slave Trade began. When Europeans infiltrate Africa and Africans were forcibly brought to the Americas in the early 1600s, slave captures and sellers shaved the heads of all African women, men, and children. The claimed purpose for this action was for sanitary reasons, to avoid inevitable carry and spread of germs and inspects that could cause sickness and death. Nonetheless shaving their heads stripped them of a lifeline to their home and a connection to their people who arrived before them. Their language was taken away and they were unable to identify with others from their tribe. Once their hair began to grow back, plaits, braids, and cornrows were the most convenient hairstyle for slaves to do that would have their hair neat and maintained for a week. On Sundays, some masters allowed their slaves to have some time to themselves to prepare for the week of labor coming. They would braid each other‚Äôs hair using grease or oil they had available, like kerosene. Cornrows were given its name by slaves who thought the style resembled rows of corn in the field. Other slaves, in Central and Southern America and the Caribbean call them cane rows because they resembled sugarcane fields. This hairstyle was useful for the livelihood of slaves. Braid patterned became symbols for freedom. Different styles and patterns were used as guide to plantations, resembling roads and paths to travel or avoid. After slavery \\"Hair straighteners suggest to blacks that only through changing physical features will persons of African descent be afforded class mobility within Black communities and social acceptance by the dominant culture\\" (Rooks 1998: 177). At the time, wig manufacturers were the only companies that advertised an African-American standard of beauty.Rooks, Noliwe M. Hair Raising. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Pres, 1998. Print. In Winold Reiss's \\"Brown Madonna\\", the Virgin Mother is shown with straight hair. Painted toward the beginning of the New Negro movement in 1925, the work showcased the sense of racial pride popular during the 1920s and 1930s. This classically White symbol of purity and virtue was created with dark skin, asserting the value and respectability of the Black race. This was a time when Blacks were creating their own successes in society and staking out a niche in the northern cities such as Chicago and Harlem in New York. Part of their personal success at this time, however, was their perceived ability to assimilate, which is portrayed by Reiss's mother's unnaturally straight hair. Painted lines seem to radiate from the mother's body, giving her an ethereal and heavenly affect. This type of figure ‚Äî one with straight hair ‚Äî was revered by Blacks of the time and suggested an example to follow. Throughout history, blacks have been pressured to subject themselves to Eurocentric beauty standards. Media portrayed white women with straight hair as the beauty ideal, which pressured other women to conform to Eurocentric beauty standards such as straightening hair and bleaching skin.https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context;=jur Civil Rights era Angela Davis (right) in 1972 with her influential hairstyle The Afro, which hit its stride in the 1960s, was an expression of pride, connection, power, revolution and differentiation. The Afro first gained popularity with performers, artists, activists, youth and nationalists.Sieber, Roy, and Frank Herreman, eds. Hair in African Art and Culture. New York: Museum for African Art and Prestel, 2000. Print. Young people who did not adopt this trend were for the first time judged and subject to \\"blacker-than-thou\\" policing by their peers. Blacks began to use their hair as a way to showcase a link to their African ancestors and Blacks throughout the diaspora. The Afro, in conjunction with the Civil Rights Movement, was helping to define black identity (Byrd and Tharps 2001: 51).Byrd, Ayana D., and Lori L. Tharps. Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America. New York: St. Martin's, 2001. Print. Some artists used their actual hair as an expression of art. In David Hammons‚Äôs American Costume, he pressed his own body onto paper to create an image of what being African-American means and looks like. Like the way he crafted the hair on the work by applying fingerprints to the paper, during the 1960s and 1970s it was not uncommon for Blacks to use chemicals to artificially kink their own hair if it wasn‚Äôt big enough.https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146885/american-costume Young Black Americans were ‚Äòfroing their hair in great numbers as a way to emulate the style of the Black Panthers and convey their racial pride. Although the Afro started in New York, it was Angela Davis, a college professor at UCLA and an associate of the Black Panther Party, who pioneered the Afro as a political statement. In embracing naturalism, she glorified the Black aesthetic and facilitated its power to connect Blacks to the Civil Rights Movement. Her Afro became especially notorious because of its presence in her \\"Wanted\\" ad, as it was her most prominent identifier. It became a way to celebrate African-ness and embrace heritage while politically rejecting European ideals. Men and women in Chicago and beyond wore it as a way to support a proud way of carrying oneself in the world and occupying space. Similarly, Wadsworth Jarrell‚Äôs Liberation Soldiers showcases Afros as almost halos. Combined with the shine present in the men‚Äôs coats, the painting conveys the spiritual aspect of trans-African culture. These men were seen as angels not only for their place in the Rights movement but also because of their naturalism and portrayal of Black heritage. In relation to hair, the time between the 1970s and the 1990s could be described as open and experimental. \\"Despite occasional political flare-ups, individual choice would increasingly dictate African- American hairstyles in this era\\" Trendy styles like braids were even adopted by whites, especially after white actress Bo Derek wore them in the movie 10. Although braids, cornrows and dreadlocks were becoming mainstream, they stirred up controversy and continue to when worn in the professional sphere. Contemporary A man with cornrows Hip Hop culture in the 1980s created a slew of new trends, one being the \\"fade\\" for men. The fade is a hairstyle worn predominantly by black men in which the hair starts off short at the bottom and lengthens as it reaches the top. This style afforded the wearer an opportunity for individuality, as people often cut designs into the back and sides or added different colors to the top Hip Hop also had an influence on young black women, who now could look to the popular musical artists on TV and album covers for inspiration. Asymmetric cuts like wedges, stacks or finger curls were popular during this time. All of these styles required some form of hair straightening. After the 1970s, men and women tended to turn away from the all-natural looks and began creating their own variety of individualized looks. Hair styling in African-American culture is greatly varied. African- American hair is typically composed of tightly coiled curls. The predominant styles for women involve the straightening of the hair through the application of heat or chemical processes. In many cases today, the overuse of heat and chemicals has left some African-American women with fairly short and damaged hair. These treatments form the base for the most common socially acceptable hairstyles in the United States. Alternatively, the predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one's hair natural. Often, as men age and begin to lose their hair, the hair is either closely cropped, or the head is shaved completely free of hair. However, since the 1960s, natural hairstyles, such as the afro, cornrows, and dreadlocks, have been growing in popularity. Despite their association with civil rights-oriented political movements, the styles have attained considerable, but certainly limited, social acceptance. Another style, waves, is closely associated with the do- rag, a cloth used to maintain the ripple-like pattern of compressed curls. It has gained popularity on social media and was referenced in the television show Atlanta. African-American women may learn to adapt to Caucasian standards of beauty, which includes straight hair. Many African-American women have chemically processed or heat processed their hair to straighten it. Celebrities such as Justin Bieber have been accused of cultural appropriation for wearing African-American hairstyles.https://www.thefader.com/2016/04/04/justin-bieber-cultural- appropiation Other celebrities accused for copying black hairstyles is Kylie Jenner and Katy Perry.https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a30389471/kylie- jenner-cultural-appropriation-black-women-hair-gwen- stefani/https://www.essence.com/hair/katy-perry-apologizes-cultural- appropriation/ Military bans In 2014, there was a new ban in the United States Army of mostly Black hairstyles. This ban includes dreadlocks, large cornrows, and twists. The rationale for this decision is that the aforementioned hairstyles look unkempt, with kempt hair being implicitly defined as straight hair. African-American women in the Army may be forced to choose between small cornrows and chemically processing their hair, if their natural hair is not long enough to fit into a neat pony tail. Facial hair Maintaining facial hair is more prevalent among African-American men than in other male populations in the U.S.Lacy, D.

Retrieved 11-08-2007. The preference for facial hair among African-American men is due partly to personal taste, but also because they are more prone than other ethnic groups to develop a condition known as pseudofolliculitis barbae, commonly referred to as razor bumps, many prefer not to shave.Lacy, op. cit. Popular culture The Afro- American culture is increasingly embracing natural hair, contributing much to society and media. Such as in art, music, poetry, and other forms of media. From textile artist Sonya Clark, singer Solange Knowles, poet Maya Angelou, and actress Lupita Nyong'o. Also on social media there is an uprising of natural YouTube channels, and blogs. The natural hair community has grown so much they even have their own vocabulary and acronyms. Including in all these different forms of media they are embraced their natural hair, skin, and being. The Natural hair movement is different from the black pride movement. The Natural hair phenomena have grown greatly. Black women are striving to be healthier, in putting less chemical process product in their hair and through consumption, which is providing nutrients to the hair .

Aditya continued his bollywood stint by singing \\"Uthale Ya Phenk De\\" for the Irffan Khan Rahul Bose Konkona Sen Sharma and Soha Ali Khan starrer \\"Dil Kabbadi\\". Aditya also sang the fun and frolic song \\"Tension Lene Ka Nahi\\" for the Manoj Bajpayee Hrishitaa Bhatt Vijay Raaz starrer \\"Jugaad\\" in year 2009.  Seven/7  The debut album 7 came through after several years of relentless struggle and hardships. It started with record labels not wanting to invest in non-film music, as the industry seemed to have forgotten about independent artists. But, it was the MD of Universal Music (Devraj Sanyal) who while judging the Kroaking Nationals at Bengaluru, was blown away with his performance as a Finalist. Devraj strongly believed that Aditya had the X-Factor to hold a crowd. This led to Universal Music India releasing his debut album \\"7\\" containing 7 of his original compositions. The album released in 2013 and is still doing brilliantly on all digital platforms making him the Artist of the Week and his song ‚ÄòTanhai‚Äô the song of the week on iTunes. The album was co-produced by Vinayak Gupta and mixed by Vijay Dayal at Yash Raj Studios. Fanaa is another beautiful composition by him. The Lyrics and intensity of \\"Tu Kaun Hai\\" can hold anyone for a long time. The album is available on Apple Music and Spotify. Some superhit songs are also available on Songdew.

Two species were described for the genus: Kombuisia frerensis (type) and Kombuisia antarctica. Dicynodonts were a diverse clade that inhabited the earth from the Middle Permian to the Late Triassic. Kombuisia is one of few species to survive the mass extinction event in the late Permian. Kombuisia are non-mammalian synapsid herbivores. Specimens of this genus were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s and years later were determined to be two different species of the genus. The two species were found in diverse areas, K. frerensis in South Africa and K. antarctica in Antarctica. This indicated that this genus existed in a wider biographical region in the southern hemisphere of Pangaea and believed by some to indicate the migration to Antarctica to avoid the rise in global temperatures that lead to the mass extinction. Migration to avoid global warming has been highly controversial because many of the fossils that are found in this region are juvenile and of small body size. But so far no Permian vertebrate fossils are known from Antarctica, making it less likely that they were already living there prior to the event. Originally the specimens that were collected in Antarctica were considered to be part of the Kingoria (now known as Dicynodontoides) genus. The specimens were originally catalogued in the American Museum of Natural History as Kingoria, however, with no formal reasoning for this categorization, this has since been revised with more up- to-date knowledge of features and speciation. Kingoria was defined early on as a close relative to Kombuisia and Hotton describes the two groups as sister taxa. Kingoria and K. frerensis were relatively close geographically during their time of existence. Kingoria fossils are found in the mid to southern region of Africa. In a re-evaluation of the cranial anatomy of K. frerensis using the rule of parsimony the most recent conclusion is that Kingoria and Kombuisia are sister taxa of the Kingoriidae clade. Discovery and geographic range Kombuisia frerensis was found in the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone in South Africa. The zone is subdivided into 3 layers and encompasses the boundary of Late Early Triassic and Early Middle Triassic period. The specimen was collected from the middle zone, B, and considered to of the early Anisian age. There is no evidence of the exact stratigraphic location of K. antarctica. The specimens are from the central Transantarctic Mountains and were found at Shenk Peak (AMNH 9562) and Graphite Peak (AMNH 9545). The fossils were found in the lower member of the 3 members of the Fremouw Formation. The lower member refers to the Early Triassic and Late Permian in some areas. Classification of species=Early controversial specification Defining the species and lineages of these fossils was difficult due to the lack of preservation and minimal cranial fossils that had been collected and catalogued. There are two types of Kombuisia species. One of these, K. frerensis, was collected in 1961 by J. W. Kitching and Nicholas Hotton in South Africa, and the other was collected in the early 1970s from the Fremouw Formation of the Transantarctic Mountains. The specimens from South Africa were catalogued in the National Museum of Natural History and were later moved to the Bernard Price Institute for Paleontological Research in Johannesburg. The specimens from the Transantarctic Mountains are catalogued in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and until 2009 had not been correctly identified. Christian Sidor, Kenneth Angielcyzk, and Jorg Frobisch worked to define this specimen as a new species of Kombuisia. Prior to 2009, the species was considered to be part of the genus Kingoria, but there was no written description and evaluation of the specification. The similarities in the skull features between Kingoria and Kombuisia made classification of the species very difficult. The two both share common traits such as a lack of premaxillary ridges and the midline ridge of the vomerine is depressed. Unlike any other dicynodont the two genera share a similar feature of a longitudinal ridge at the edge of the premaxilla. Hotton analyzed the small skull that was found just south of Lady Frere, Cape Province, north of the Cacadu River in South Africa. The specimen had a complete lower jaw and stapes that proved pivotal in the description and definition of the species. K. frerensis has many similar features as Kingoria which made it difficult to diagnose as a new species. The two share features such as no post-canine teeth, a wider inter orbital bar than inter temporal bar, and the length of the post orbital region equals the distance from the post orbital bar to the snout. Current specification The differences that make the two genera distinguishable and the species distinguishable from other dicynodonts are seen in the dentary. The ventral profile slopes upward and forward from the splenial to the tip of the beak, the front and side margins of the beak are sharp, and the symphysis tapers to a squared-off anterior margin as opposed to being parallel sided. The most distinctive feature that defined the new genus at the time was the lack of a pineal opening. This led Hotton to the determination that the fossils belonged to a new Dicynodont species, Kombuisia frerensis. Until 2009 this was the only species of the genus that was thought to have existed. In 2009 Christian Sidor, Jorg Frobisch, and Kenneth Angielczyk identified the new species as K. antarctica. The two species had been catalogued in the American Museum of Natural History as specimens AMNH 9562 and 9545. One of the most definitive differences between the two species is the slit-like pineal opening in K. antarctica. There is also no contact between the post orbitals in K. antartica, which is a feature seen in the K. frerensis specimens. Cranial description=K. frerensis *Fused premaxilla *Absence of a pineal foramen *Inverted triangular shape of the interparietal bone *Lack of fusion of articular and prearticular bones *Presence of an elongate, slender parietal posterolateral process that extends onto the occipital edge of the skull roof. *Skull length approximately 76.8 mm K. antarctica *Skull length of approximately 73 mm (AMNH 9562) *Skull length of approximately 69 mm (AMNH 9545) *Lacking tusks *Lack of premaxillary or postcanine teeth *Antorbital region is greatly abbreviated *Slit-like pineal foramen *Anterior tip of the snout is rounded *Narrow intertemporal region *Parietals exposed as a narrow ridge between the ventrolaterally sloping postorbitals. *No clarity whether K. antarctica possesses the elongate posterolateral process of the parietal found in K. frerensis due to lack of preservation of both existing specimens. Paleobiology The lack of a complete skeleton makes it difficult to re-create what the species may have looked like; however, analysis of the skull allows for an estimate of the animal's body size. The skull length of K. frerensis and K. antarctica differs by only 4‚Äì8 mm, K. frerensis being the larger of the two. While the exact body size cannot be determined, the skull size indicates that the genus was relatively small in body size. Since Fr√∂bisch reviewed the cranial anatomy of K. frerensis and was able to closely relate the genus to Kingoria, subsequent attempts to re-create the species represent similar body plans. However, Kingoria are typically just over 50% larger than that of Kombuisia. It has often been proposed that Antarctica was a destination of migration to avoid the global warming in the Middle to Late Permian. However, further analysis of the body size of many of the specimens found in the lower member of the Fremouw Formation indicated that these species already existed in Antartica. Kombuisia provides knowledge of specimens in both South Africa and Antarctica; in addition, examination of the cranial length and features indicates a small body size for Kombuisia‚Äîtoo small to migrate seasonally from the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone in South Africa to the central Transantarctic Mountains, which provides further argument against the proposed hypothesis. Evidence of tetrapod burrows is also found in the lower member of the Fremouw Formation. These burrows indicate that the environment may have been too harsh for a tetrapod to live above ground and suggest a permanent subterranean residence of many of the species in Antarctica. This may also suggest that K. antarctica was fossorial, like many of the other tetrapods that existed in this environment around the same time. According to Dr. Angielczyk, \\"K. antarctica was about the size of a small house cat, considerably different from today‚Äôs mammals ‚Äì it likely laid eggs, didn't nurse its young, and didn't have fur, and it is uncertain whether it was warm blooded.\\" References Category:Dicynodonts Category:Triassic synapsids Category:Triassic synapsids of Africa Category:Extinct animals of Antarctica Category:Triassic Antarctica Category:Anisian life ","title":"Kombuisia"},{"id":"26641150","text":"Joseph E.

The International Film Festival is produced by the Martha's Vineyard Film Society, a 503 c3 non-profit corporation. The recurring theme of the annual Martha's Vineyard International Film Festival is \\"Other Places\\"; the festival's purpose is to encourage attendees to think broadly (about how huge the world of film is) and deeply (about the universal concerns and desires that unite all people). About 90% of all film selections are world cinema, helping to fulfill the festival mission of promoting cross-cultural understanding through film. The Martha‚Äôs Vineyard International Film Festival presents a selection of world cinema feature and short films that are curated from festivals such as Berlin, Toronto, Sundance, Cannes Film Festivals, with a few undiscovered gems thrown in. The movies are followed by post ‚Äúconversations‚Äù that bring together guests from film, media, and art to discuss and debate with the audience the issues, cultural idiosyncrasies, and triumphs of the cultures revealed by the extraordinary series of films. The entertainment continues right outside the screening venues in downtown Vineyard Haven in the festival‚Äôs ‚ÄúWalking Festival District‚Äù, with local shops and restaurants hosting special events, cocktail parties, artist showcases, live music and more.  2010 Festival Highlights  The 2010 festival's new Global Citizen Award, went to veteran actor and activist Matthew Modine for his long-term dedicated to environmental challenges. One of Modine‚Äôs many accomplishments was the creation of Bicycle for a Day, which promotes bicycling as an alternative to driving in order to both cut pollution and promote healthier living. Another event that drew record crowds was the new, jury-judged, short film competition. An expert panel chose NYU student: Luke Matheny‚Äôs \\"GOD OF LOVE\\" as winner over nearly 200 other entries. The audiences response agreed with the selection made by the jury. Mr. Matheny received a $500 cash award for Best Short Film. 24 features and 30 short films were screened during this four-day festival.

He is a popular attraction at many athletic events such as football, basketball, and volleyball. He also appears for various campus and community functions. Sammy's two-minute routine earned him a national championship of the mascots division at the 2005 United Spirit Association Collegiate National Championship. Sammy was also named the 2010 and 2011 National Cheerleading Association (NCA) Mascot National Champion. In the 2012 nationals season, Sammy competed with the SHSU Co-Ed Cheer Team (who made their first appearance ever) at the National Cheerleading Association (NCA) collegiate cheer competition. Together they won first place and earned the title of NCA Division I Cheer National Collegiate Champions. In 2013 Sammy also competed with the SHSU Co-Ed Cheer Team who won their second straight national championship title for NCA. Sammy returned to the Band Shell in Daytona Beach to compete alongside the SHSU All-Girl cheer team who won the NCA All-Girl Division I National Championship Title in 2014. In 2015 Sammy was able to wrap his paws around another NCA Division I title as he competed alongside the Co-Ed Cheer Team. In 2016, Sammy competed alongside the SHSU Division I Co-Ed Cheer Team to win another 1st place NCA National Championship. Sammy was also chosen as the 2016 NCA Mascot National Champion after showcasing a great routine in Daytona Beach, Florida.

Sammy at a SHSU Football Game History Sam Houston Normal Institute‚Äôs athletics teams were originally nicknamed the Normals. When the Texas Legislature changed the name of Sam Houston Normal Institute to Sam Houston State Teachers College, the term ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù became outdated. The settled replacement was Bearkats, though early references spelled the name either \\"Bearcats,\\" \\"Bear Cats,\\" or \\"Bearkats.\\" A bearcat is said by some to be a kinkajou, a small, golden, carnivorous mammal that resides in the jungles of South America. It is doubtful those who coined the \\"Bearkat\\" nickname had either a kinkajou or a binturong in mind. However, more likely, the name came from a popular local saying of the time, \\"Tough as a Bearkat!\\" Since the animal in the saying was thought more mythical than real, the spelling settled upon was \\"Bearkat.\\" In the late 1940s, then SHSU President Harmon Lowman attempted to change the Sam Houston mascot from Bearkats to \\"Ravens\\" (after General Sam Houston's Cherokee nickname). Mrs. Vernon Schuder reported that the alumni were polled and she voted for the raven, but that \\"all those old Bearkats beat us out!\\" Three real kinkajous graced the SHSU campus in their role of a live mascot at various times during the 1960s and 1970s. On December 14, 1959 Sammy began appearing at sporting events and other university functions.

He served during the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of Rear-Admiral. Walker spent his early years in the navy at first in British waters during the invasion scares of 1779, and then in North American waters where he saw action at most of the decisive naval battles of the war, particularly at the Chesapeake, St. Kitts and the Saintes. He reached the rank of lieutenant before the end of hostilities and spent the interwar years travelling on the continent. Returning to service with the outbreak of war with the French, he again participated in many of the key naval actions of the period, with his service at the Glorious First of June securing his promotion to his own commands. His career was almost ended with an accusation of disobeying orders, which led to his dismissal from the navy, but he was reinstated in time to develop a plan to subdue the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore. He commanded a ship at the Battle of Camperdown, and another at the Battle of Copenhagen, earning Nelson's praise for his actions. The early part of the Napoleonic Wars were spent in the Caribbean, where Walker played an important role in the Haitian Revolution, and took the surrender of a French garrison. After time spent escorting convoys, Walker joined the ships covering the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil, and struck up a friendship with the Prince Regent. His association with royalty continued with his services in transporting the Duke of Clarence, Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia, and he was duly invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and a Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword. His later years were spent managing a fleet off the American coast during the War of 1812, and he commanded several ships after the end of the wars, retiring with the rank of rear-admiral. Family and early life James Walker was born in 1764, the son of James Walker of Innerdovat, Fife and his wife the novelist, Mary Leslie, the third daughter of Alexander Melville, 5th Earl of Leven. He entered the navy as a midshipman aboard the 32-gun on 18 December 1776, serving under Captain William Garnier. He went out to Jamaica in January 1777, but returned to British waters for service in the North Sea and then the English Channel with Sir Charles Hardy's fleet during the invasion crisis in 1779. While serving in the Channel in 1780, Southampton captured an 18-gun French privateer off Portland, with 80 men aboard her. Walker was sent to assist in removing the prisoners, and after doing so remained on board to help with the baling and pumping, as the privateer was in danger of sinking. Despite his efforts the privateer suddenly sank, nearly taking Walker down with her. He was in the water for ten minutes before being rescued. The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783. William Garnier was succeeded by Philip Affleck in command of Southampton in August, and the ship returned to Jamaica. Walker continued to serve on her until June 1781, when he was transferred to the 98-gun , the flagship of Rear-Admiral Joshua Rowley. Walker was appointed to act as lieutenant on 18 June 1781 and was assigned to HMS Torbay, part of Sir Samuel Hood's squadron despatched to North America. Under Hood Walker saw action at the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781, the Battle of St. Kitts on 26 July 1782, and the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782. During the Battle of the Saintes Torbay had ten men killed and 25 wounded. Walker was then on the verge of being promoted again, due to the intimate friendship between his father and Admiral Sir George Rodney, but before this could be carried out Rodney was superseded by Admiral Hugh Pigot, and Walker remained at his previous rank. He continued on aboard Torbay, and was present at the Action of 18 October 1782, when Torbay and encountered the French 74-gun Scipion. The British ships chased her into Samana Bay, Haiti, where she ran aground and was wrecked. Walker received his lieutenant's commission on 8 May 1783. Years of peace After the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker visited the continent, touring through France, Germany and Italy. While in Vienna in 1787, news reached him of political troubles with the Dutch, and he began to journey back to England in hope of a commission. While travelling through the forest near Aschaffenburg, the diligence he was in was attacked by ten armed men, who fired into the coach and demanded the passengers' money. Walker attempted to resist them, but was left unsupported by his fellow passengers, and was knocked down, robbed, and thrown into a ditch. The robbers took 800l of money and rode off, believing Walker to be dead. He came to, suffering from a sabre cut to the head, and was carried into Aschaffenburg. There his wounds were treated free of charge by the local surgeons and authorities, and on recovering sufficiently he was brought to Frankfurt. There the local lodge of freemasons offered him financial assistance, and on his arrival at Mainz he was presented to the Prince-Bishop, Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal. The Archbishop gave him a letter detailing his adventure in the forest near Aschaffenburg, and commending his bravery. Despite this assistance Walker was unable to reach England until after the Dutch crisis had abated, and so returned to his travels in Germany. The outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War created a new opportunity for Walker, when in 1788 the Russians offered him command of a ship. The Admiralty refused to grant him permission to accept however, and Walker was obliged to turn it down. Despite this, Walker returned to service in the Royal Navy in 1789, with an appointment on 11 September to the 24-gun , based at Leith under Captain Sampson Edwards. He transferred to the 32-gun on 24 January 1790, serving in the English Channel under Captain Richard Fisher. He left the ship in February 1792 and spent nearly a year at home. He was back on active service from 2 December with an appointment to the 98-gun , intended as the flagship of Walker's old commander, now Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck. Boyne escorted a convoy of ships of the East India Company to the Tropic of Capricorn, and Walker remained with her until shortly after the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France. On 24 June 1793 he transferred to the 32-gun , which was then under Captain the Honourable Arthur Kaye Legge, as first-lieutenant. French Revolutionary Wars=Promotion and temporary commands Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg, 1795. Niger was attached to the Channel Fleet, and took part of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 with Lord Howe. She was one of the repeating ships at the Glorious First of June, though she did not take part in the fighting herself. Walker's role as signal lieutenant secured him promotion to commander on 6 July 1794. He went as a volunteer with Legge to , had a stint as acting commander of and in April 1795 he was in temporary command of the bomb vessel . He received an appointment on 15 July 1795 to the temporary command of the 50-gun , and was ordered to escort five East Indiamen to a safe latitude, and then to return to Spithead. Having escorted the merchants to the designated point he received news that a fleet of 36 English merchants were assembled at Cadiz, in need of an escort. Dismissal and reinstatement Disobeying his orders to return to Spithead, Walker made for Cadiz, gathered the convoy, and escorted them to Britain. It was a controversial action. The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth ¬£1 million, and would have been at considerable risk from enemy vessels were it not for Walker's escort. However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed, arresting five of Trustys officers while she was at Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant's money out of the port, and demanding Walker be court-martialled. Walker justified himself by pointing to the imminent alliance between France and Spain, but despite the Lords of the Admiralty being sympathetic to his cause, he was found guilty of disobeying orders, and was dismissed from the navy. The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port. There it was suggested that he wait in Britain, and with the Spanish declaration of war, Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council. Mutiny and Camperdown Shortly afterwards mutiny broke out at Spithead and at the Nore. Walker proposed an attack on the mutinous ships at the Nore using heavily armed gunboats, fitted with carronades, and was commissioned by the Admiralty on 10 June to carry this out. Walker set out down the Thames but only got as far as Gravesend before news reached him that the mutineers had submitted and his operation was no longer necessary. He was appointed acting-captain of HMS Garland on 16 July 1797 and conveyed a Baltic- bound convoy of merchants as far as Elsinore. The Battle of Camperdown, 11 October 1797 by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1798. On his return he was appointed captain of the 64-gun on 20 August, still in an acting capacity. Monmouth had been one of the most mutinous ships of the whole fleet, and was heavily involved in the Nore mutiny. Walker took her to join Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet in the North Sea. Within a short time he was able to restore good order aboard her, and was able to play a significant role in the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October. As she approached the Dutch fleet Walker gathered the crew and addressed them saying 'My lads, you see your enemy; I shall lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes. Now, go to your quarters and do your duty.' During the battle Monmouth engaged the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar for an hour and a half, forcing both of them to surrender. Monmouth, which had lost five men killed and 22 wounded, took Alkmaar in tow, and despite sailing through a strong gale, reached the shelter of Yarmouth roads five days later. The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, and Walker was among those captains rewarded, having his post rank confirmed on 17 October, and receiving the Naval Gold Medal and the thanks of parliament. He attended the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on 19 December, and assisted in depositing the captured enemy colours. Later commands and Copenhagen The Battle of Copenhagen, by Nicholas Pocock Walker took command of the 64-gun on 8 February 1798, before transferring in quick succession to the 56-gun , the 98-gun , the 90-gun and lastly the 50-gun on 7 October 1800. He commanded Isis in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea, as well as with the Channel Fleet. Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and joined Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, . Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephants, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery. When eventually Nelson was able to work his way down the line he left Walker at his task and took another position. As he passed, Nelson took off his hat, waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'. After four and a half hours of intense fighting Isis silenced her opponents, at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded. Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts. Peace, and Napoleonic Wars=Caribbean and Haiti Walker received an appointment to command the new 32-gun on 1 July 1801 and took a convoy of merchants to Jamaica. He continued to be employed, despite the drawdown of the navy following the Peace of Amiens, and received command of the 74-gun on 27 January 1802. With the resumption of hostilities in 1803 he was assigned to the Blockade of Saint-Domingue, and captured the 44-gun French frigate Cr√©ole, bound for Port au Prince with 530 troops under General Morgan. On 25 July he captured the French 74-gun Duquesne. After taking his prize to Jamaica Walker returned to his station and on 1 October demanded the surrender of the French garrison at Saint-Marc. The garrison of 1100 men was besieged by the forces of generals Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe, and were short of food. They agreed to surrender to Walker and were taken off in order to save them from the vengeance of the besieging forces. In doing so he saved their lives, but as his provisions were rapidly exhausted he was forced to return to port to resupply at the point at which Cape Fran√ßois was about to fall, and so missed out on a considerable sum of prize money. Convoys Walker was then given command of his prize, the Duquesne, on 2 March 1804, and sailed her from Jamaica to Chatham with only 160 men. Also embarked on the Duquesne were an almost equal number of French prisoners, which had to be closely watched during the passage, in case they made an attempt to take the ship. Duquesne arrived in England without incident, and Walker paid her off for repairs. He then received command of the 36-gun HMS Thalia on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and Quebec. The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly, with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure. The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates, which delivered the convoy, but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806. After setting sail Thalia became caught in a gale off the Newfoundland Banks and ran for 1250 miles for five days under bare poles. After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the Guernsey station under Sir Edmund Nagle, where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at St Malo. Portuguese service John VI of Portugal. Walker became a confidant during his time in Brazil while John was Prince Regent. In October 1807 Walker was transferred to the 74-gun and was sent to Lisbon with Sir Sidney Smith. While there the decision was made to evacuate the Portuguese Royal Family to Brazil, just prior to the capture of the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, by Napoleonic forces. HMS Bedford joined , and as an escort for the Portuguese ships, with the British squadron being commanded by Commodore Graham Moore. The fleet was dispersed by heavy gales off Madeira, though Bedford was able to rejoin the ships carrying the royals two days later, and was the only British ship to escort them for the rest of the thirteen-week voyage. Walker struck up a friendship with the Prince Regent, who wanted to create him a member of the Order of Aviz, but owing to Walker's religion, he instead recreated the military Order of the Tower and Sword. The Prince Regent invested himself with the honour, and then immediately created Walker a Knight Commander of the order on 30 April 1816, making him the senior Knight Commander of the order. Walker spent two years with the court at Rio de Janeiro, and in addition to the honour, received the Prince Regent's portrait set in brilliants, a valuable diamond ring, and several letters testifying to Walker's good service. Royalty, and the Americas On Walker's return to Britain he asked for, and received, orders to join the fleet in the North Sea. Still in command of Bedford, he took part in the blockade of Flushing under Admiral John Ferrier, narrowly avoiding being wrecked in a gale on 14 January 1814. After being repaired she joined Admiral William Young, and then Admiral Scott to go into Flushing. In the summer of 1814 Walker was selected to accompany the Duke of Clarence on his journey to Boulogne to collect Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia. Bedford then formed part of the fleet assembled for a Royal review. He then made two trips to bring army units back from the continent. In September 1814 he took command of a squadron carrying the advance guard of an invasion force to occupy New Orleans under Major-General John Keane. During the campaign the senior naval officers, Sir Alexander Cochrane and Rear-Admirals Pulteney Malcolm and Edward Codrington, went ashore, leaving Walker to manage the fleet, which owing to the shoal water, had to be kept a hundred miles offshore. Later years Memorial in St Leonard's Church, Seaford Walker continued to receive employment despite the end of the wars with France and America, commanding in turn the 74-gun ships , and , paying off Northumberland on 10 September 1818. He was nominated a Companion of the Bath on 4 June 1815, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821. Walker was reportedly a cheerful and friendly officer, who won respect through his leniency and good nature. His commanding officer, William Young, once complimented him for keeping Bedford in a state of high discipline without once resorting to a flogging over a period of five months and three weeks. While in command of the Northumberland he was praised for his actions when he and his crew fought a fire that had broken out in Sheerness Dockyard, and which had threatened to destroy the entire yard. James Walker was twice married, at first to a daughter of General Sir John Irwin, Commander-in-Chief, Ireland. The marriage did not produce any children and after her death Walker married Priscilla Sarah, the fourth daughter of the MP Arnoldus Jones-Skelton. The couple had three sons; the eldest, Melville, entered the army, while the two younger sons, Leven Charles Frederick and Thomas, followed their father into the navy. Rear-Admiral James Walker died at Blatchington, near Seaford, Sussex on 13 July 1831 at the age of 67, after a short illness. Notes a. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography instead lists Princess Royal as the flagship of Sir Peter Parker. Tracey's Who's Who in Nelson's Navy lists Rowley. Winfield's British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714‚Äì1792 records that Princess Royal, under Captain Harry Harmood, had been Rear-Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's flagship at the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, and subsequently at the Actions of 15 and 19 May 1780 against de Guichen's fleet. Harmood had however been replaced later in 1780 by Captain John Thomas Duckworth, and had become Rowley's flagship prior to sailing to Jamaica. She remained Rowley's flagship into 1781, when Duckworth was succeeded by Captain Charles Hotchkyns, and until her return home with a convoy and being paid off later in 1781. b. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Walker had received his promotion on 18 June 1781. This date is quoted in contemporary biographical sketches in the Annual Biography and Obituary, The United Service Journal, and Marshall's Royal Navy Biography. Tracey's Who's Who in Nelson's Navy however describes this as an acting-lieutenancy, and that Walker did not receive his commission until 8 May 1783.

While the authorship and dating of both works are not in doubt, it is believed but not proven that they were created as wings of a devotional diptych and that at some unknown time the panels were broken apart.They were most likely separated in the late 18th or early 19th century when Netherlandish paintings fell out of fashion. A diptych panel fitting the description of the Mary wing was described in a 1629 inventory of paintings owned by Alexandre d'Arenberg, a descendant of Philip I de Cro√ø (1435‚Äì1511).Campbell, 110 Both have been approximately dated to 1460 and are now in Antwerp and San Marino, CA respectively. The reverse of de Cro√ø's portrait is inscribed with the family crest and the title used by the sitter from 1454 to 1461.Hand & Wolff, 242The de Cro√ø panel would have been more attractive to buyers of the time as single portrait panel, ie as a genre piece. The right hand panel depicts Philip I de Cro√ø, chamberlain to Philip the Good and comte de Chimay from 1472 until his death, possibly at battle, in 1482. De Cro√ø would have been around 25 at the time of the portrait, and the style of his haircut has been used to approximately date the work. The left wing, today in San Marino, shows the Virgin and Child against a gold background depicted in a style indebted to Byzantine Marian icons.Borchert, 206 Van der Weyden underscores the idea of the Virgin panel being an unearthly apparition before the donor by giving her wing a golden background which contrasting sharply with de Cro√ø's more muted and ordinary flat backdrop. The artist further establishes a link between the human and divine through the playful manner of given to Christ. As with van der Weyden's other mother and child diptych's the child faces the donor, while his hand is stretched outwards, almost beyond the boundary of the right hand panel, as if to make a connection with the donor to the left. Art historian Martha Wolff suggests the implication of this gesture is to extend the connection to the actual viewer presumably worshiping at the diptych -like de Cro√ø- before the mother and child.Wolff, 116 Description After van der Weyden's appointment as official painter to the city of Brussels in 1436, he became a highly sought after painter of both secular and donor portraits. While the surviving works of his mid career are mainly single religious works and triptychs, by c. 1460 his reputation and the demand for his work was such that he seems to have concentrated on commissions. These panels are amongst four confirmed diptychs where he paired the patron opposite a representation of the Virgin and Child. In all a half-length male patron is represented on the left wing, with the tell-tale motif of hands folded in prayer. The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the \\"place of honour\\" alongside the divine. Similarly, the donor's portrait is always set against a flat dark nondescript background, while the Virgin and Child are framed against brilliantly lit golden or gilded backdrops.Hulin de Loo, 53 van der Weyden is widely credited as the first to use the diptych format for donor portraits and for establishing conventions that were to last until the mid 16th century; his are the first to combine a half length portrait (of the donor) with a half length depiction of a saint or saints. The pairing with the Mary panel appeared as if a vision appearing before the donor. The monograph on the top left of de Cro√ø's panel has not been definitively interpreted, but is very similar to similar crests found on manuscripts known to have been in his collection. Like Philip the Good, de Cro√ø was cultured, strongly interested in and a patron and collector of visual artworks. He was active as both a soldier and later as an ambassador, while at the same time he was bibliophile and noted collector of illuminated manuscripts. He amassed a renowned library; it is thought that the inclusion of the lavishly embroidered book in the Mary panel was intended to flatter him. Virgin and Child Crop of the Virgin and Child panel, showing the halo built from golden beams of light radiating outwards from his head In the early 15th century Mary grew in importance as possible intercessor with God with members of the Catholic faith. The concept of purgatory as an intermediary state that each human soul had to pass through before they were admitted to heaven, was at its height. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth.MacCulloch, 11-13 Prayer was the most obvious means of decreasing time in limbo, while the more well off substituted by commissioning churches or extensions or artworks, or devotional portraits. Mary, although under represented in the gospels, developed a cult that gathered from the 13th century, mostly built on the idea of the Immaculate Conception and her ascension into heaven. Thus, in a culture that venerated the possession of relics as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary could have left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity.MacCulloch, 18 The veneration that developed around her in this period lead to a high demand for donor portraits with the commissioner shown in devotion. Van der Weyden responded with half length Marian portraits which echoed in style and colour the Byzantine icons then popular in Italy as \\"miracle\\" working paintings. The format became extremely popular in the north, and his innovation is a major contributing reason for the emergence of Marian and after more general devotional diptychs as a lasting format of Early Netherlandish painting. Mary is shown against a gilded background, holding the infant Christ's hand. She wears a dark hooded cloak or veil over a red dress. The infant stands unsteadily on a highly decorated and embroidered red and yellow cushion. He is shown as restless and energetic, toying with the clasps of a prayer book. Both figures have golden halos which radiate outwards as if beams of light. Mary shares many of the idealised facial features seen in late period van der Weyden depictions of the Madonna; she has olive eyes, a high forehead, and symmetrical, arched eyebrows.Silver, 5 The painting first emerged in 1892 as part of Henry Willett's collection in Brighton. It passed through the Kann collection in Paris, and is today on display at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.Campbell, 109 Philip de Cro√ø  Crest shown on the reverse of de Cro√ø's panel De Cro√ø is shown in half length, wearing a high neck dark purple doublet with fur lining. His hands are folded in prayer. He holds a pearled rosary between his thumbs and index fingers, the stones of which reflect the light falling on him. One end of the string ends with a gold braided tassel, the other with a gilded crucifix. The portrait is set against a background of pleated green cloth, which has been laid down on silver leaf in slim layers of verdigris glaze. The quality, subtlety and craftsmanship behind the subtlety was only revealed in a recent restoration; previously the area was covered by layers of accumulated dirt, and it had been thought that the portrait was set against a simple dark plane. The background is decorated with a monograph which has not yet been positively identified, although it does appear in manuscripts that Philip owned. Van der Weyden flatters his sitter by endeavouring to conceal the young Belgian's large nose and undershot jaw, presenting a picture of a refined and pious nobleman.Campbell, 15 The artist typically dignified his sitters by depicted elongated facial features, delicate fingers and other idealised features which the subject may not have been blessed with in life.Gr√∂ssinger, Christa. . Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997. 60. This tendency can be seen in the description of de Cro√ø's strong jaw and sculpted nose. The painting can be approximately dated to from the late 1450s to early 1460s by de Cro√ø's haircut, which is long at the front and above the ears but shaved at the side and below the ears. He wears a clipped and straight length fringe; a monkish fashion popular amongst male Burgundian nobles during this period. The high cut below the ear is similar to that seen worn by Nicolas Rolin in Jan van Eyck's c 1935 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, however de Cro√ø's side cut is not as severe or pronounced, and is accompanied by a longer fringe too daring for even a few years earlier. This is assuming that the sitter is Burgundian and not a foreign visitor; the identifying crest on the outer wings as well as his pointed Northern European facial features argue against this possibility.Hulin de Loo, 54 References=NotesSources *Borchert, Till-Holger.

KTWT joined Fox on July 1, 2012, replacing KXTF (channel 35); the station began broadcasting its digital signal at that time and branded as \\"Fox 14\\" (making it one of a handful of digital stations to brand using its physical channel as opposed to its former analog channel); MyNetworkTV programming is shown out- of-pattern weeknights at 10 p.m. KTWT was also added to a new third digital subchannel of KMVT. On February 27, 2014, the station changed its call letters to KSVT-LD to reflect an increased emphasis on Blaine County and the Wood River Valley, including Sun Valley (from which the call letters are derived). (A previous and unrelated low-power TV station in Ketchum had also operated as KSVT-LD, simulcasting with KSVX-CD in Hailey.) On March 12, 2015, Gray Television announced that it would purchase KSVT-LD and KMVT from Neuhoff Communications for $17.5 million. The sale was completed on July 1. Newscasts With KTWT's transition to Fox affiliation, there was a significant expansion of the news operation of sister station KMVT. More specifically, the CBS affiliate began producing a half-hour extension of its morning newscast Rise and Shine that is seen weekdays at 7 a.m. on KSVT. In addition, this station added half-hour newscasts at 5 p.m. on weeknights only and every night at 9 p.m. The news broadcasts on KSVT utilize a separate news anchor on weeknights and feature more regional, national and international news of the day compared to the newscasts seen on KMVT. As with local newscasts on KMVT, daily newscasts seen on KSVT-LD are broadcast in high definition. Concurrent with the relaunch as KSVT, Neuhoff Communications announced that the station will open a Wood River Valley bureau.

He was son of Zhu Shouyong, he was one of 9th-generation descendant (same generation with Taichang Emperor) of Zhu Tan, Prince Huang of Lu, 10th son of Hongwu Emperor. The mansion of Prince of Lu was located at Yanzhou. The Qing forces had attacked Yanzhou and made the mansion collapsed. At that time, the peerage of Prince of Lu was succeeded by Zhu Yihai's eldest brother, Zhu Yipai. After Qing came, Zhu Yipai committed suicide with his two another brothers, Zhu Yixing (Êú±‰ª•Ê¥ê) and Zhu Yijiang (Êú±‰ª•Ê±ü). After his brothers suicide, Zhu Yihai was enfeoffed as the 11th Prince of Lu by Chongzhen Emperor. After four days he succeeded his peerage, Li Zicheng attacked Beijing and he fled to southern China. Reign The Prince of Lu was part of the resistance against the invading Qing dynasty forces. His primary consort (ÂÖÉÂ¶É), Lady Chen, committed suicide during the impending fall of the Ming. The location of her suicide can still be found on the island of Zhoushan. In 1651 he fled to the island of Kinmen, which in 1663 was taken over by the invading force. His grave was discovered on the island in 1959, which disproved the theory advanced by the 18th-century History of Ming that he was killed by Koxinga. His eldest son, Zhu Honghuan (Êú±ÂºòÊ°ì), married the fourth daughter of Koxinga and went to live in the Kingdom of Tungning Taiwan under the protection of Zheng Jing, his brother-in-law and worked as a farmer. Another Ming Prince who accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan was the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui. After the surrender of the Kingdom of Tungning, the Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives.Manthorpe 2008, p. 108.

The mathematical formulation is the following: a Brownian particle (ion, molecule, or protein) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. The narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem.M. J. Ward, S. Pillay, A. Peirce, and T. Kolokolnikov An Asymptotic Analysis of the Mean First Passage Time for Narrow Escape Problems: Part I: Two-Dimensional DomainsHolcman, D., & Schuss, Z. (2015). Stochastic Narrow Escape in Molecular and Cellular Biology: Analysis and Applications. Springer. When escape is even more stringent due to severe geometrical restrictions at the place of escape, the narrow escape problem becomes the dire strait problem.D. Holcman Z. Schuss, The dire strait time, SIAM Multiscale Modeling and simulations, 10(4), 1204‚Äì1231. The narrow escape problem was proposed in the context of biology and biophysics by D. Holcman and Z. Schuss, and later on with A.Singer and lead to the narrow escape theory in applied mathematics and computational biology.  Formulation  The motion of a particle is described by the Smoluchowski limit of the Langevin equation:Z. Schuss, Theory and Applications of Stochastic Differential Equations (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics - (1980)Z. Schuss, Theory and Applications of Stochastic Processes. An Analytical Approach. Series: Applied Mathematical Sciences, Vol. 170. dX_t=\\\\sqrt{2D} \\\\, dB_t+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}F(x)dt where D is the diffusion coefficient of the particle, \\\\gamma is the friction coefficient per unit of mass, F(x) the force per unit of mass, and B_t is a Brownian motion.  Mean first passage time and the Fokker-Planck equation  A common question is to estimate the mean sojourn time of a particle diffusing in a bounded domain \\\\Omega before it escapes through a small absorbing window \\\\partial\\\\Omega_a in its boundary \\\\partial\\\\Omega. The time is estimated asymptotically in the limit \\\\varepsilon= \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Omega_a}{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\ll 1 The probability density function (pdf) p_{\\\\varepsilon}(x,t) is the probability of finding the particle at position x at time t. The pdf satisfies the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}p_{\\\\varepsilon}(x,t)=D \\\\Delta p_{\\\\varepsilon}(x,t)-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma} abla ( p_\\\\varepsilon (x,t) F(x)) with initial condition :p_\\\\varepsilon (x,0) = \\\\rho_0(x) \\\\, and mixed Dirichlet‚ÄìNeumann boundary conditions (t>0) :p_\\\\varepsilon (x,t) = 0\\\\text{ for }x \\\\in \\\\partial\\\\Omega_a :D\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial n}p_\\\\varepsilon (x,t) - \\\\frac{p_\\\\varepsilon (x,t)}{\\\\gamma} F(x)\\\\cdot n(x)=0 \\\\text{ for }x \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega - \\\\partial\\\\Omega_a The function : u_\\\\varepsilon (y) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\int_0^\\\\infty p_\\\\varepsilon (x,t y) \\\\, dt \\\\, dx represents the mean sojourn time of particle, conditioned on the initial position y. It is the solution of the boundary value problem :D\\\\Delta u_\\\\varepsilon (y) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}F(y)\\\\cdot abla u_{\\\\varepsilon}(y) = -1 :u_\\\\varepsilon (y) = 0\\\\text{ for }y \\\\in \\\\partial\\\\Omega_a :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_\\\\varepsilon (y)}{\\\\partial n} = 0\\\\text{ for }y \\\\in \\\\partial\\\\Omega_r The solution depends on the dimension of the domain. For a particle diffusing on a two-dimensional disk :u_\\\\varepsilon (y)=\\\\frac{A}{\\\\pi D}\\\\ln\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon}+O(1), where A is the surface of the domain. The function u_{\\\\epsilon}(y)does not depend on the initial position y, except for a small boundary layer near the absorbing boundary due to the asymptotic form. The first order term matters in dimension 2: for a circular disk of radius R, the mean escape time of a particle starting in the center is :E(\\\\tau  x(0)=0 ) = \\\\frac{R^2}{D}\\\\left(\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right) + \\\\log 2 + \\\\frac{1}{4}+O(\\\\varepsilon)\\\\right). The escape time averaged with respect to a uniform initial distribution of the particle is given by :E(\\\\tau ) = \\\\frac{R^2}{D}\\\\left(\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right) + \\\\log 2 + \\\\frac{1}{8} + O(\\\\varepsilon)\\\\right). The geometry of the small opening can affect the escape time: if the absorbing window is located at a corner of angle \\\\alpha, then: E\\\\tau = \\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{\\\\alpha D} \\\\left[\\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} +O(1)\\\\right]. More surprising, near a cusp in a two dimensional domain, the escape time E\\\\tau grows algebraically, rather than logarithmically: in the domain bounded between two tangent circles, the escape time is : E\\\\tau = \\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{(d-1)D} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} + O(1) \\\\right), where d > 1 is the ratio of the radii. Finally, when the domain is an annulus, the escape time to a small opening located on the inner circle involves a second parameter which is \\\\beta = {\\\\frac{R_1}{R_2}} < 1, the ratio of the inner to the outer radii, the escape time, averaged with respect to a uniform initial distribution, is: E\\\\tau = \\\\frac{(R_2^2-R_1^2)}D\\\\left[\\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} + \\\\log 2 + 2\\\\beta^2 \\\\right] +\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{R_2^2}{1-\\\\beta^2}\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta}- \\\\frac{1}{4}R_2^2 + O(\\\\varepsilon,\\\\beta^4)R_2^2. This equation contains two terms of the asymptotic expansion of E\\\\tau and 2\\\\epsilon is the angle of the absorbing boundary. The case \\\\beta close to 1 remains open, and for general domains, the asymptotic expansion of the escape time remains an open problem. So does the problem of computing the escape time near a cusp point in three-dimensional domains. For Brownian motion in a field of force : F(x) eq 0 \\\\, the gap in the spectrum is not necessarily small between the first and the second eigenvalues, depending on the relative size of the small hole and the force barriers, the particle has to overcome in order to escape. The escape stream is not necessarily Poissonian. Analytical results A theorem that relates the Brownian motion escape problem to a (deterministic) partial differential equation problem is the following. :Theorem. Let \\\\Omega be a bounded domain with smooth boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega and \\\\Gamma be a closed subset of \\\\partial\\\\Omega. For each x\\\\in\\\\Omega, let \\\\tau_{x} be the first time of a particle hitting \\\\Gamma, assuming that the particle starts from x, is subject to the Brownian motion in \\\\Omega, and reflects from \\\\partial\\\\Omega. Then, the mean first passage time, T(x):=\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\tau_{x}] , and its variance, v(x):=\\\\mathbb{E} [(\\\\tau_{x}-T(x))^{2}], are solutions of the following boundary value problems: :: \\\\- \\\\Delta T = 2 \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega, \\\\textT=0 \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma, \\\\text\\\\partial_{n}T=0 \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega \\\\setminus \\\\Gamma :: \\\\- \\\\Delta v = 2 \\\\vert abla T \\\\vert^2 \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega, \\\\textv=0 \\\\text { on } \\\\Gamma, \\\\text\\\\partial_n v = 0 \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega \\\\setminus \\\\Gamma Here \\\\partial_{n}:=n\\\\cdot abla is the derivative in the direction n, the exterior normal to \\\\partial\\\\Omega. Moreover, the average of the variance can be calculated from the formula : \\\\bar{v} := \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vert \\\\Omega \\\\vert} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} v(x) dx= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vert \\\\Omega \\\\vert} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} T^2(x) dx =:T^2 The first part of the theorem is a classical result, while the average variance was proved in 2011 by Carey Caginalp and Xinfu Chen. The escape time has been the subject of a number of studies using the small gate as an asymptotically small parameter. The following closed form result gives an exact solution that confirms these asymptotic formulae and extends them to gates that are not necessarily small. :Theorem (Carey Caginalp and Xinfu Chen Closed Formula). In 2-D, with points identified by complex numbers, let :: \\\\Omega := \\\\left{r e^{i \\\\theta} \\\\vert 0 \\\\leq r < 1, \\\\text- \\\\varepsilon \\\\leq \\\\theta \\\\leq 2 \\\\pi - \\\\varepsilon \\\\right}, \\\\text\\\\Gamma := \\\\left{e^{i \\\\theta} \\\\vert \\\\vert \\\\theta \\\\vert \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\right} :Then the mean first passage time T(z), for z\\\\in\\\\bar{\\\\Omega}, is given by :: T(z) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\vert z \\\\vert^2}{2} + 2 \\\\log{ \\\\left \\\\frac{1-z+\\\\sqrt{(1-z e^{-i \\\\varepsilon})(1-z e^{i \\\\varepsilon})}}{2\\\\sin{\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2}}}\\\\right } '' Another set of results concerns the probability density of the location of exit. :Theorem (Carey Caginalp and Xinfu Chen Probability Density). The probability density of the location of a particle at time of its exit is given by :: \\\\bar{j}(e^{i \\\\theta}) := - \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} T(e^{i \\\\theta}) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\text{if }\\\\varepsilon < \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi -\\\\varepsilon \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\cos{\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}}}{\\\\sqrt {\\\\sin^2{ \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2}} - \\\\sin^2{ \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}}}}, & \\\\text{if } \\\\vert \\\\theta \\\\vert < \\\\varepsilon \\\\end{cases} '' That is, for any (Borel set) \\\\gamma\\\\subset\\\\partial\\\\Omega, the probability that a particle, starting either at the origin or uniformly distributed in \\\\Omega, exhibiting Brownian motion in \\\\Omega, reflecting when it hits \\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\setminus\\\\Gamma, and escaping once it hits \\\\Gamma, ends up escaping from \\\\gamma is : P( \\\\gamma ) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} \\\\bar{j}(y) dS_y where dS_{y} is the surface element of \\\\partial\\\\Omega at y\\\\in \\\\partial\\\\Omega. Simulations of Brownian motion escape In simulation there is a random error due to the statistical sampling process. This error can be limited by appealing to the central limit theorem and using a large number of samples. There is also a discretization error due to the finite size approximation of the step size in approximating the Brownian motion. One can then obtain empirical results as step size and gate size vary. Using the exact result quoted above for the particular case of the circle, it is possible to make a careful comparison of the exact solution with the numerical solution . This illuminates the distinction between finite steps and continuous diffusion. A distribution of exit locations was also obtained through simulations for this problem.  Biological applications = Stochastic chemical reactions in microdomains  The forward rate of chemical reactions is the reciprocal of the narrow escape time, which generalizes the classical Smoluchowski formula for Brownian particles located in an infinite medium. A Markov description can be used to estimate the binding and unbinding to a small number of sites.

Like many Akans the Aowin are believed to have originated further up north eventually settling in Bonoman and then migrating from there to their present location due to several existential forces: Namely, the Denkyira and Ashanti, who after decades of war gained control of the Aowin state during various periods of time[Fairhead, J., & Leach, M. (2003). Reframing deforestation global analyses and local realities : Studies in West Africa. London: Routledge.] . Even when under occupation the Aowin continued to wield significant power and remained relatively independent as a powerful gold producing Akan state with relative military superiority over neighbors.

History=Early 18th century It appears that migrations in the early 18th century brought together Mande horsemen and their malams from the North and Akan peoples from the East. Together with the indigenous Ndenyi people, they were amalgamated into one people with a mixed language and culture. Mid 18th century In the mid 18th century, a small band of mercenaries left Ano to the Upper West region, Upper East region, and Northern region. The band consisted of Mande horsemen, Akan musket-toting foot soldiers, and some Muslim scholar amulet-makers.Kirby 1986, p. 34 These groups provided the basis for a society divided into three classes or estates: Nobles, commoners and Muslims. Eventually, the small army established a camp on the shores of the Oti River where the town of Mango in Togo stands today. Since they were warriors and not farmers, they made their living by conducting raids into the farming communities around them. This provided them with wives and slaves as well as foodstuffs and livestock. Eventually the people settled in the surrounding farming communities, and assimilation took place.

The Akan sub-group speak the Akan dialect Sefwi language. The term Sefwi, which refers to the language spoken and the Sefwi people mythically originated from the withering of the Twi phrase, \\"Asa awie\\" which translates \\"War is over\\", by immigrants from Bono-Techiman, Wenchi, Adanse, Denkyira, Assin and Asante who settled on the territories of Aowin (modern-day Sefwi) escaping the 17th century wars. Geographically located on the Western North Region, Sefwi is about 200 kilometers from the coast, and covers an area of 2,695 square miles crossed by the Tano and Bia rivers. The Sefwi like other Akan tribes originated from the ancient world; Northern part of modern Africa. Through wars many families forced their ways out to live in their present domains. For example, Obumangama of Sefwi Wiawso fume was told to have established his domain at Ewiaso because of its strategical position. Evidence suggests that by the end of the 17th century, Aowin's ambition to expand economically and politically led to confrontations with a strong new forces that try to control the trade routes and gold sources around 1715. This made Aowins eventually lose much of their territory to the new forces. New immigrants were victorious in their wars. They settled with many of their captives such as Aowin. This reveals why their language is seemly influenced by their closed tribes such as Bono, Wassa, Ahanta, Asante. Many of the families of Sefwi also stayed at different places among other tribes such as Adanse, Denkyira, and Asante, Bono, Aowin, Nzima before they finally settled at their new environment. Through these different staying at different places many of the Sefwi trace their origins from the immediate past where their memory can recall. For example, many of the families that trace their root to Denkyira, also classify themselves as Agona Royals. Sefwi, collectively is made up of three traditional states namely Anhwiaso, Bekwai, and Wiawso, all of which have a mutually independent paramount chief and share a common deity Sobore and a common yam festival called Alluolue or Elue. With a total population of about 572,020 (2010), Sefwi has 7 Districts and 7 Constituencies, comprising Bia West, Bia East, Bibiani/Anhwiaso/Bekwai, Bodi, Juabuso, Sefwi Akontombra and Sefwi Wiawso. Sefwi shares the Western Region with the Aowin, Wassa, Nzema and the Ahanta. Sefwi is endowed with natural resources such as gold, bauxite and timber. The fertile nature of the land, has served as bait for farmers from other regions mostly Northern, Krobo and Ashanti. With cocoa farming as the main occupation of the people, Sefwi produces about 2/3 of Ghana's cocoa. Sefwi Wiawso, Bibiani, and Sefwi Bekwai are the largest townships within the Sefwi land. The Sefwi land is a great place for investment given that it is blessed with almost all resources there is in Ghana.

The drang√πe () is a semi-human winged divine figure in Albanian mythology and folklore, associated with weather and storms. The drangue is born with a caul and two or sometimes four wings under the arms and has supernatural powers, especially in the wings and arms. He is made invulnerable by the singular conjunction produced at his birth, and can die only if this conjunction is repeated once again. The main goal of the drangue is to fight the kulshedra in legendary battles. He uses meteoric stones, lightning-swords, thunderbolts, piles of trees and rocks to defeat the kulshedra and to protect mankind from storms, fire, floods and other natural disasters caused by her destructive power. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles. Name and etymology Standard Albanian form of the name is drag√πa (def. drag√≥i). A common dialectal variant is drangue. Durham recorded the form drangoni. The Albanian term drang√πe/drag√πa is related to drang√´, dr√´ng√´, dr√´ng√´z√´, \\"a small fresh-water fish that does not grow very big\\", and to Gheg Albanian dr√£ng, \\"kitten, puppy, cub\\", generally used for a \\"wild baby animal\\", most likely related to the singular birth conditions of this mythological figure. In Albanian tradition, there are two semantic features of the term drag√πa. Some of the earliest Albanian works includes the term drag√πa to describe a dragon or hydra-like monster, such as found in Roman mythology and in Balkan folklore. cited by . With the same meaning other old sources use instead the term kulshedra. The other semantic sense of the term drag√πa, which is widespread in collective Albanian beliefs, is that of a hero battling the Kulshedra, a mythological tradition already attested in the 17th century Albanian texts, such as the 1635 Dictionarium Latino-Epiroticum by Frang Bardhi. cited by The term drangue is also used in some Albanian dialects (including also the Arb√´resh) with the meaning of \\"lion\\" and \\"noble animal\\". Origin of the myth The legendary battle of a heroic deity associated with thunder and weather, like drangue, who fights and slays a huge multi-headed serpent associated with water and storms, like kulshedra, has been preserved from a common motif of Indo-European mythology. Similar characters with different names but same motifs representing the dichotomy of \\"good and evil\\" ‚Äì mainly reflected by the protection of the community from storms ‚Äì are found also in the folklore of other Balkan peoples. Birth Babies destined to become drag√πa are born \\"wearing shirts\\" and qeleshes, with two or four wings under their arms. This notion that the predestined hero are born \\"in a chemise\\" does not refer to them literally wearing articles of clothing; rather, these are babies born with their heads covered in caul, or amniotic membrane. In some regions (such as Celza parish), it is said that drag√πa babies are only born to parents whose lineage have not committed adultery for three generations, or from mothers who were kulshedras.  Appearance and attributes  The drangues are semi-human warriors with extraordinary strength, giving them the ability to tear trees out of the ground and throw large boulders at their enemies. They can also cast lightning bolts and meteors, or whole houses. The wings and arms of a drag√πa are thought to be the source of his power and if their bodies are dissected, a golden heart with a jewel in the middle of it will be found. As warrior fighting the kulshedra, he is armed with the \\"beam of the plow and the plow-share\\", cited by or a \\"pitchfork and the post from the threshing floor, and with the big millstones\\". cited by He also employs his cradle is used as shield to parry blows from the kushedra. These heroes may live unnoticed among humans and are thought to be \\"invulnerable, untouchable, and undefeatable\\". They have \\"supernatural powers which become apparent while they are still babies in their cradles. When thunder and lightning strike Drag√πas assemble with their cradles at the Drag√πa gathering place\\". In southeastern Albanian regions of Pogradec and Kor√ßa, the drag√πa is \\"envisaged.. as a beautiful strong horse with wings, who defends civilization and mankind\\". \\"Male animals can also be born as drag√πas. Black rams will attack a Kulshedra with their horns, and black roosters will furiously pick out its eyes. Only billy goats can never be drag√πas\\". Battle with kulshedra Thunderstorms are conceived as battles between the drangues and the kulshedras, the roll of thunder taken to be the sounds of their weapons clashing. This shares many similarities with chaoskampf, a mythological trope of the Proto-Indo-European religion, where a Storm God battles a many-headed Sea Serpent. Drangues are believed to perpetually battle with the Kulshedra. Or he is said to have slain her for good, having knocked her unconscious by throwing trees and boulders at her, and afterwards drowning her in the Shkumbin River, according to the localized lore of central Albania.  Highland lute  In the Lahuta e Malc√≠s (English: Highland Lute)‚Äîone of the most important heroic epics of Albania‚Äîthe drangues are presented as the personification of the Albanian Highlands heroes, and are the central figures of the 16th and the 17th canto. In the 16th canto a kulshedra escapes from a cave in Shal√´ to take revenge on Vocerr Bala, a drangue. A force of drangues gather and defeat the kulshedra. After the battle they are invited by oras, female protective spirits, to celebrate their victory. In the 17th canto the central figures are two drangues named Rrustem Uka and Xhem Sadrija. After preparing for a wedding ceremony, they travel to Qaf√´ Hardhi (English: Grapevine Pass) to rest. While cleaning their weapons and smoking, they discover that eight Montenegrin battalions, consisting of three hundred soldiers led by Mark Milani, are marching against Plava and Gucia. The two drangues with the help of local shepherds manage to defend Qaf√´ Hardhi and defeat the Montenegrin troops which retreat at Sutjeska.  Modern beliefs  The belief that a drag√πa can be born every day has persisted among Albanian mountain folk until recently, and there are still elderly people alive who espouse the belief. In Mal√´sia, a region in northern Albania and southern Montenegro inhabited mostly by Albanians, the locals believe that the drangues exist and live among them. Syncretism in Albanian folklore 18th century icon of Saint George and the Dragon by √áetiri brothers, from Ardenica Monastery, now in the National Museum of Medieval Art in Tirana. In Albanian folklore, Saint George and Saint Elias (originally the Old Testament prophet Elijah) both have stories in which they fight (and defeat) a Bolla/Kulshedra. Saint Elias, in particular, is identified in some regions with the Drag√πa and is also a weather god and provides protection against storms and fire.

The Azalea Trail Maids are a group of fifty high school seniors chosen yearly to serve as \\"Official Ambassadors\\" for the city of Mobile, Alabama. The Maids, wearing dresses meant to look like flowers, make appearances at many local, state, and national events. They often serve as greeters when foreigners and dignitaries visit the city, and are required to be knowledgeable about the city landmarks and history. In addition, they must have a good grade point average to be accepted and have great interview skills. The Maids are selected through a dual interview process, interviewing at the school and county level. Hundreds of girls initially try out, but only fifty become Azalea Trail Maids. The Maids are meant to embody the ideals of \\"Southern hospitality\\", and appeared at the inauguration of United States President Barack Obama. History The group gained its name from Mobile's Azalea Trail, a garden trail within the city. The trail traces its beginnings to an effort by the Mobile Junior Chamber of Commerce during the 1920s that saw the planting of azaleas along the city's streets. Following the establishment of the trail, dignitaries were invited to officially open the trail each spring, with local debutantes serving as event hostesses. This arrangement changed in 1949, with the establishment of the first Azalea Trail Court. The court featured two senior girls sent from each of the four local high schools. The Azalea Trail Festival was established in 1951, with additional girls from neighboring Jaycees organizations invited to serve on the court. During this period the reigning Miss America served on the court as the Queen of the Azalea Trail. The event became so popular that, by the mid-1950s, each Jaycee chapter in Alabama, and a few from other states, had a representative at the festival. It was decided to limit the size of the court to fifty senior girls from Mobile County high schools. The court has remained in this arrangement since that time. A new program was started for the out-of-town girls, leading directly to the establishment of America's Junior Miss. Inaugural controversy Controversy erupted in January 2009, after the group was invited by the inauguration committee of Barack Obama to represent Alabama in the inaugural parade. The president of the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, Edward Vaughn, made the statements that another group should represent Alabama in the parade to better reflect the history of the state, that the antebellum-style costumes that the Maids wear are a reminder of the slave era, and that the group would be a ‚Äúlaughingstock.‚Äù Advocates of the Maids defended the organization, citing that the dresses are also meant to represent azalea blossoms and that the group is racially diverse. Following Vaughn's comments Sam Jones, the first African American mayor of Mobile, issued a written statement: Alvin Holmes, Alabama's longest-serving African American state legislator, commented that: The Mobile County Commission gave US$10,000 to help fund the Maids' trips to the inauguration. Vaughn later apologized for calling the group a laughingstock, but continued to express his view that an additional group from Alabama representing the civil rights movement should march with the Maids for the inauguration of the first African American president of the United States. A segment concerning the controversy was filmed for NBC's Today show, but never aired because of other news coverage. The Maids participated in the parade on January 20, 2009.

Hehir (; November 10, 1855 ‚Äì June 9, 1935) was a Roman Catholic priest and the fourth president of Pittsburgh Catholic College (later called Duquesne University). Hehir served as president of the university from 1899 until 1930. In Hehir's thirty-one years of presidency, the small college grew to become a university and the seventh largest Catholic school in the United States. After his retirement, Hehir served as Superior of the Holy Ghost Missionary College near Philadelphia, and then as the Superior of the Spiritan Fathers at Ferndale Seminary in Norwalk, Connecticut until his death. Personal background Martin Hehir was born near Kildysart, County Clare, Ireland in 1855. He graduated from Blackrock College in 1887, having obtained a traditional classical education. After teaching there for three years, Hehir went on to receive theological training at the Theological College in Chevilly outside of Paris and was ordained as a priest in the Congregation of the Holy Ghost in 1883. He came to Pittsburgh in 1884 as a professor of languages at the Pittsburgh Catholic College. By 1892, he was Vice-President of the College. President of Duquesne University Fifteen years after he had arrived in Pittsburgh, Father Hehir became president of the Pittsburgh Catholic College, succeeding Father John Murphy on August 20, 1899. His first move was to reorganize the College, creating a clearly defined College Division (akin to the four-year college track common in the United States today), as distinct from the Preparatory School, as well as taking steps to reconcile ethnic tensions between the Irish administration of the College and the German Catholic community in Pittsburgh. He also reconciled the college debt by 1900. Several Catholic institutions at the time were making moves toward university status, so in 1910, Hehir's administration decided to submit an application to a special College and University Council from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Nine months of hearings and evaluations ensued; on March 30, 1911, the petition for a change of charter was granted, and the college was reincorporated as a university. At the time, it was the only Catholic university between Washington, D.C. and South Bend, Indiana. Father Hehir's vision of expansion for the new university was the impetus for the foundation of a law school in September 1911, and in 1913, the Business School was founded as the School of Accounts, Finance, and Commerce. A personal dream of Hehir's‚Äîthe foundation of a School of Speech Arts and Drama‚Äîwas also accomplished in 1913. Various other departments and schools were founded at Duquesne before World War I, including a School of Social Services, the School of Graduate Studies, and Departments of Sanitary Science and Public Health, Vocal and Instrumental Music, Fine Arts, Pre-Medical, Spanish Language, and Latin American Commerce. After World War I, Duquesne University was in a position to expand its physical facilities. Father Hehir undertook a vigorous fundraising campaign, and a gymnasium and academic building were constructed. With the additional space provided by these new constructions, the university founded a School of Pharmacy, which was officially opened in September 1925. In 1926, the School of Music was also founded, offering \\"melody writing, Gregorian Chant, and other forms of musical composition\\". Completing this spree of expansion was the foundation of the School of Education in 1927. Throughout these years of expansion, Father Hehir maintained a tradition of student assemblies, which imparted a sense of intimacy and elevated Hehir to the status of a father figure. In fact, most students knew him solely by a term of endearment, \\"Daddy Hehir\\". These assemblies frequently addressed student behavior. Father Hehir's thirty-one year presidency has been the longest by far of any Duquesne president. His administration saw a sixfold increase in enrollment from 1911 to 1921, and witnessed Duquesne emerge to become the seventh-largest Catholic school in the country; this meteoric rise can be attributed largely to Hehir's pragmatism and commitment to serving the Catholic community in Pittsburgh during a time when immigrants struggled to assimilate into larger society. Moreover, at the beginning of his presidency, Hehir took stock of the needs of the immigrant community in Pittsburgh and transformed the Pittsburgh Catholic College from a basically liberal arts school into an institution with a focus on more practical disciplines in legal and commercial fields. Retirement and death An official announcement that Hehir would resign from the office of present was made in Pittsburgh newspapers on October 13, 1930. The Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost subsequently reassigned Hehir as Superior of the Holy Ghost Missionary College in Cornwell Heights, near Philadelphia. Later, he served as Superior of the Senior Seminary of the Holy Ghost Order at Ferndale, in Norwalk, Connecticut. While in Norwalk, Father Hehir received news that he was terminally ill with cancer. He announced that he wished to die in the city of Pittsburgh, and on June 9, 1935, he died at Mercy Hospital, only three blocks away from Duquesne University. Future Spiritan priest and president of Duquesne University Henry J. McAnulty, an undergraduate student at the time, served at Hehir's funeral Mass on June 11, 1935. Hehir's body was then taken from the university chapel to St. Paul's Cathedral, where a vigil was held by alumni throughout the night. A funeral, celebrated by the provincial of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Fr. Henry J. Goebel, followed at the cathedral on June 12. A second Mass was held at 10 a.m. by Hehir's successor as president, J. J. Callahan; an Office of the Dead, attended by Pittsburgh Bishop Hugh C. Boyle, and Bishop Daniel F. Desmond of Alexandria, Louisiana, preceded the Mass. Afterwards, the body was moved to Holy Ghost College at Cornwell Heights for a final Mass and subsequent interment. Legacy By the end of Father Hehir's presidency he was being lauded for the positive legacy he left at Duquesne and in the city of Pittsburgh. A Mr. Reis declared at his retirement dinner that \\"There is no other living man in the city of Pittsburgh who by his work and his labor has rendered so much good and has radiated such a wonderful influence over this community as [Father Martin Hehir].\\" Joseph Rishel, in his history of Duquesne University, The Spirit that Gives Life, writes of Father Hehir that \\"never, before or since, would one man be such an overshadowing figure to the school\\". Hehir maintained a highly visible presence in the day- to-day life of the university, participating in and supporting college events, and taking personal interest in the lives of students. A popular legend of his presidency was that Father Hehir had two groups of student files: one for \\"those who can pay\\" and another for \\"those who cannot pay\\"; he was often willing to bankroll the education of talented students, confident that the school would be repaid later. His relationship with the deans of the schools was also notably good: all the founders of the various schools‚Äîexcept one‚Äîstill headed those schools at the time of his retirement. St. Martin's Hall, a 15-story high-rise residence hall for freshman students at Duquesne, was constructed in August 1962 and named after Father Hehir.

Design and development Originally started under the designation 483T, the Colmar was designed as a twin-engined airliner or VIP and staff transport, based on the earlier four- engined Br√©guet 482 bomber. It was an all-metal mid-wing cantilever monoplane with twin fins and rudders and retractable tailwheel landing gear. The fuselage cabin was divided into two due to the main spar, up to six passengers in the forward cabin and 17 in the rear.

However, from that point onwards the influence of the newspaper declined sharply.Migdal, Joel S. Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 68 During the initial phase of its history the newspaper was patronized by Hayim Carmona. His son Isaac Carmona served as its editor from its founding year. After his father's death in 1883, Isaac Carmona took over as patron of the newspaper whilst the post of editor passed on to Mercado Fresco and Sami Alkabez. After a few years, David Fresco became editor. He served as editor of the newspaper for almost fifty years. El Tiempo was supported by the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle. As a result, the newspaper promoted the teaching of the French language to its readers. Moreover, it sought to educate its readers in the Turkish language. It ran a section in Turkish (written in the Hebrew alphabet) every two-three days. The world-view of the paper in its early phase was largely Eurocentric, reporting events from the capitals of Europe (Paris, London, Vienna, Budapest and Berlin) whilst paying little attention to events inside the Ottoman Empire (including Constantinople/Istanbul itself). Fictional stories published in the newspaper were largely translations from French. The promotion of the French language was however somewhat subdued in the 1890s, but the language used in articles was often a heavily French- influenced Ladino.Migdal, Joel S. Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. pp. 59-61 Once Zionism emerged as a political force, El Tiempo responded by proclaiming its loyalty to the Ottoman Empire. Within the Ladino Jewish community in Constantinople/Istanbul (where Zionist ideas were beginning to take root) El Tiempo argued that Ottoman Jews ought to remain Ottoman nationals. There was a brief period (prior to 1910) during which discussions were ongoing between the World Zionist Organization and El Tiempo, but any re-evaluation of Zionism on behalf of El Tiempo was sealed as David Fresco aligned with prominent anti-Zionist Rabbi Chaim Nahumhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts- and-maps/fresco-david.

Plot  The only daughter of village elder Ponnambalam, Mangalam, prepares for her prospective groom's visit. The groom, Chella Durai, and his family visit Mangalam's house. Chella Durai falls for Mangalam, who is very na√Øve and shy. The next day he visits Mangalam at the riverside and she panics. Mangalam's uncle, martial arts trainer Nambiar, mistakes Chella Durai to be mishandling Mangalam. Mangalam runs and Nambiar sends his men to fight Chella Durai. Chella Durai defeats them and Nambiar learns he's Mangalam's groom. Ponnambalam's brother-in-law Ayyavu loves Mangalam and was not inform of the groom's visit. Chella Durai and his family visit the astrologer to fix a date for his reception, but there is no auspicious day that month. So the family plans to set the reception next month. Chella Durai visits Mangalam's house, where she is alone. She is shy of him and runs out of the house. Nambiar arrives and gives Chella Durai an idea to court Mangalam. Chella Durai kidnaps Mangalam and soon, she opens up to him. On new moon day, Nambiar performs the rites for someone, whose identity is unclear, who died from suicide. In the meantime, Chella Durai hopes to explain sex to the innocent Mangalam, who is still shy. But she starts to love Chella Durai more. Chella Durai's stepmother demands more dowry than what Ponnambalam can give and refuses to compromise. Before Ponnambalam leaves for a panchayat, Chella Durai visits him and gives him money for the dowry so he can marry Mangalam. Ponnambalam is humiliated and refuses. The next day Mangalam advises Chella Durai to marry another girl due to the dowry problem. Chella Durai hits Mangalam for persuades her to elope the next morning. But Mangalam refuses to disobey her father or his dignity would be lost. Chella Durai's parents catch him stealing money from their house to elope, so they lock him in a room. Mangalam waits until sunrise and returns home when Chella Durai fails to turn up. At home, Ponnambalam attempts suicide but Nambiar saves him. Ponnambalam doubts his daughter's innocence and Mangalam, hearing this, burns her feet. Ponnambalam learns about this and forgives Mangalam. But he still detests Chella Durai. Nambiar invites Chella Durai to stay in his house and promises to change Ponnambalam's mind. Nambiar visits Ponnambalam to persuade him. Mangalam admits she will only marry who her father decides. Nambiar challenges to Ponnambalam he will unite Mangalam and Chella Durai in 1 month or cut half his moustache. Nambiar then stirs up a panchayat and the villagers desert him, his assistant Karuppannai, and Chella Durai. There are only 15 days remaining in the challenge. Chella Durai takes a nuptial string to Mangalam and single-handedly fights Ayyavu and his men. In the last 10 days, Nambiar persuades men in buses to visit Mangalam and reject her on purpose. Ponnambalam hits his daughter and wife when 7 ‚Äògrooms‚Äô reject her. Unable to witness Mangalam abused by Ponnambalam, Chella Durai decides to leave the village. But Nambiar refuses to let him leave due to the ego problems he will face when the challenge is over. So both of them have a fight to see who wins. Chella Durai wins Nambiar and is about to leave, but is guilty when he remembers the bond they shared. Nambiar takes Chella Durai to the grave he performs rites at, explaining it is none other than his lover from 40 years ago. Nambiar was in a similar state as Chella Durai and so he abandoned his lover but she committed suicide. Fearing Mangalam may follow the same, Nambiar persuades Chella Durai to marry her at all costs. The next day, Ponnambalam decides to marry Mangalam with Ayyavu and distributes marriage invitations to the villagers. Mangalam's mother and grandmother advise her to elope with Chella Durai and explain Ponnambalam's ego to her. Ponnambalam overhears this and learns his mistake. He forgives Mangalam and rips the invitations. But when Ayyavu learns about this, he stabs Ponnambalam and Chella Durai suppresses him. Ponnambalam bleeds profusely and everyone hurries to help him. In his dying breaths, Ponnambalam indicates to Chella Durai his consent to Mangalam's marriage.  Cast  * K. Bhagyaraj as Chellai Durai * Sulakshana as Mangalam * M. N.

Early life Abdulla al shamsi (or Abdul Qader al- Raes) was born in 1951 in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. He first began to take art seriously, at the age of 14, following his father's death, when his mother (abdulla al shamsi) sent him to Kuwait to live with his sister. He considered himself, ‚Äúlucky because the Kuwaiti government was supporting art at that time so I had access to all the art materials I needed for free.‚Äù He showed an early talent, which he attributed as a \\"gift from God.\\" He remained with his sister in Kuwait until he was 18 yrs old by which time he had completed his basic education at the grammar school. Undoubtedly, Abdul Qader's early experiences in Kuwait, including the teachings impacted his development both artistically and intellectually. Career On his return to the Emirates, in 1974, he worked at the Ministry of Labour as a labour inspector and pursued his further education by earning a degree in Sharia Law at the United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain. From 1974, he discontinued painting altogether and did not pick up a paint-brush for another 12 years. When he began painting again, he focussed on producing sweeping landscapes, architectural studies and abstract forms. As a young artist, he was awarded first honour for his artwork inspired by the movie, The Agony and the Ecstasy. This signaled the beginning of his career in art. Abdul Qader's incessant pencil and watercolour sketches clearly defined his role in life as an artist. These early works has led to continued success, as he received multiple awards, which garnered the attention of national and international media. Abdul Qader Al Rais became a household name in the GCC world of fine arts. As an artist, he is largely self-taught. His interest in old local architecture gems and nature were depicted in romantic realism. His early work explores local scenery, coastlines and idyllic landscape in the UAE. They were essentially realist but it is an extraordinary realism distilled by an exacting eye and a mystical imagination which gives his works much of its power. Not only does he capture the place, but also the sense of time, in a medium that is most expressive, appealing and challenging ‚Äì watercolour. His later works, both in oil and watercolour, retain much of the original influences, but also include geometric elements and calligraphy, which may be familiar to the Middle Eastern eye, but seen as esoteric or enigmatic to Western audiences. He is a founding member of the Emirates Fine Art Society and is considered to be one of the pioneers of contemporary art in the Emirates, noted for his mainly abstract artwork which has been widely exhibited both within the UAE and abroad. Al Rais artwork can be found in Emirati palaces, government offices and in the personal art collections of members of the royal family of Dubai. Works He is most noted for abstract works that incorporate geometric forms and Arabic script. The use of floating squares across the canvas has become a signature feature in his artworks. He continued for the next several years to concentrate on local sceneries that became his trademark. Then, at the crucial juncture of his career, when he was moving beyond the traditional subjects in watercolour so indelibly associated with his name, Abdul Qader stepped outside himself and began to address issues of artistic authorship and individual style with acuity and critical distance. Motifs of geometric ops producing multiple illusions of depth were initially added on to the subject. With this series, Abdul Qader succeeded in making the geometric forms surrounding the subject matter equally important as the subject matter itself. Moving further, changes in paint handling and stylistic staccato make for extreme variations among his realistic paintings resulting into calligraphic abstract juxtaposed with geometric ops and realistic images in vibrant new canvasses. The merging of style is his language of pure individual self-expression ‚Äì and that style is not inextricably bound to a single, authorial hand, but rather separate, mobile, detachable, and potentially re-inhabitable ‚Äì Abdul Qader Al Raes‚Äô signature style. In 2015, his artwork was used to decorate carriages of the Dubai Metro, as part of the Dubai Arts Season. During 2016, Al Rais art pieces were included in a group exhibition in Berlin, entitled Art Nomads ‚Äì Made in the Emirates which represented contemporary Emirati art and culture.

It was brought to public and widespread media attention by a March 2010 documentary by Dispatches in which a journalistic sting operation recorded and revealed Members of Parliament and the Lords offering to work for a fictitious political lobbying firm for fees of ¬£3,000 to ¬£5,000 per day. As a result of the scandal, Labour MPs Patricia Hewitt, Geoff Hoon, Margaret Moran and Stephen Byers were all suspended from the party. Hoon, Byers and Richard Caborn later also received bans from Parliament.  Background  Twenty politicians were approached by the documentary: fifteen agreed to meet, ten arranged meetings, and of those ten, nine were secretly filmed. These nine included the Conservative MP, Sir John Butterfill and Labour Party MPs Stephen Byers, Patricia Hewitt, Geoff Hoon, Richard Caborn, Adam Ingram and Margaret Moran. The Labour members were all due to stand down at the next general election and all but Moran have been ministers, and many had served in the cabinet. Byers had been Transport Secretary (resigned 29 May 2002);Hoon Defence and then Transport Secretary (resigned 5 June 2009); Hewitt Health Secretary (resigned 27 June 2007); Caborn Minister for Sport (Resigned 28 June 2007) and Ingram was Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Resigned 29 June 2007). In 2009 after criticism surrounding her expense claims the Labour Party had barred Moran from standing again. Conservative MP Julie Kirkbride was one of the politicians approached by the fake agency established by the programme, but declined to assist them. It was reported that an unnamed Conservative MP did agree to work for the fake agency. The bogus firm was named Anderson Perry, after the Marxist historian Perry Anderson.  False interviews  Members of Parliament were invited to an interview by an undercover reporter claiming to be the director of a company hoping to influence policy. They were met and secretly recorded. The story was broken by The Sunday Times Insight team and followed up with the Dispatches documentary. Amongst the controversial comments made to the reporter were Geoff Hoon saying he wanted to make \\"some real money,\\" Margaret Moran boasting she could call on a \\"girls' gang\\" of female ministers to help the fictitious company, and Stephen Byers describing himself as \\"sort of like a cab for hire.\\"  Byers' interview  Byers made claims of having influenced government policy in the past for money. He claimed to have spoken with Peter Mandelson and Lord Adonis in the past to influence outcomes for National Express and Tesco. Lord Adonis admitted having private discussions with Byers about it but denied that he had \\"come to any arrangement\\", and Mandelson said he remembered no such discussion or meeting. Byers later withdrew his name for consideration by the fictitious lobbying company via email, claiming he had over-stated his role and wrote \\"I have not spoken to Andrew Adonis or Peter Mandelson about the matters I mentioned.\\" When the story broke, National Express and Tesco also denied there was any truth in Byers' statements.  Butterfill's Interview  Conservative MP Sir John Butterfill was also implicated and offered to lobby to benefit the fictitious company and use his political connections for a payment of ¬£35000 a year. Butterfill was also seen on the programme saying that it was likely that he would be made a peer and go to the House of Lords, the following day the leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron said, \\"I can tell you that is not going to happen.\\"  Hoon's Interview  Geoff Hoon was interviewed shortly after a trip to Washington where he had undertaken : Three days of Nato work then a couple of days of Hoon work. In the interview he went on to state that : One of the challenges I think I am really looking forward to is sort of translating my knowledge and contacts about sort of international scene into something that bluntly makes money and further argued that :There will be opportunities for American companies in particular to look around at some (em) vulnerable European companies because those companies will become vulnerable as their own governments cut back on defence spending. I foresee, its one reason why I'm talking to American private equity firms, I foresee a period where we may well see American companies in effect, buying market share in Europe because they will be buying up national champions who are not getting the support they need to, to continue.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/politicians- for-hire-video Channel 4 Dispatches: Politicians for hire, Transmitted Monday 22 March 2010 8pm on Channel 4http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/4od#3051050 Channel 4 Dispatches: Politicians for hire, Transmitted Monday 22 March 2010 8pm on Channel 4  Political response  Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was \\"appalled\\" and Chancellor Alistair Darling said it was \\"ridiculous\\". Norman Baker, of the Liberal Democrats, will be referring the matter to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, described the matter as \\"shocking\\" and called for an inquiry. Stephen Byers referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. On 22 March 2010 it was announced that Patricia Hewitt, Geoff Hoon, Margaret Moran and Stephen Byers had been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party. Geoff Hoon told the BBC that Gordon Brown had told him he would no longer be performing unpaid work with NATO on behalf of the government. Meanwhile, David Cameron launched a call for a full inquiry. On 9 December 2010, Geoff Hoon along with Stephen Byers and Richard Caborn were banned from parliament, the Standards and Privileges Committee banned Geoff Hoon for a minimum five years as his was the most serious breach, whilst Byers received two years and Caborn six months.  Media response  The media was especially critical of Stephen Byers, who claimed to have lobbied for money in the past.

It was purpose built to be the home of the national team and to serve as the headquarters of the Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFUK). Coincidentally, the RFUEA ground has another parallel with Twickenham Stadium in the United Kingdom in that it also serves as the home ground for the Kenya Harlequin Football Club, just as their sister club the London Harlequins once played at Twickenham. Many internationally renowned teams have played here including the British Lions (1955 & 1962), the Barbarians (1958), the Springboks(1961) and (1964). The 2009 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy took place on this site (with some games also being played on the neighbouring Impala RFC ground). As the site for one of the largest and most prestigious annual sevens tournaments in Africa, the Safari Sevens, the RFUEA ground has hosted matches between such diverse teams as Samoa, Emerging Springboks, Zimbabwe, British Army, Public School Wanderers, Bristol University and Universit√© de Grenoble. At an altitude of above sea-level, it is higher than three of the four vaunted stadia of South Africa's highveld; Loftus Versfeld Stadium Pretoria at , the Free State Stadium Bloemfontein and Royal Bafokeng Stadium Rustenburg . Only Ellis Park in Johannesburg at is higher.http://www.stadiumdb.com Planning In the early days of rugby in East Africa, when major games were to be staged and larger than normal crowds were expected, Parklands Sports Club (the then home of Nondescripts RFC) served as the venue. But by 1949 attendance for these events had swelled and other venues had to be rented by the Union to facilitate them. The African Stadium (now Nairobi City Stadium) was most frequently used, though Mitchell Park Stadium (now Jamhuri Park Stadium) was the venue for the match against the Combined (Oxford and Cambridge) Universities touring team of 1951. It had been apparent to the RFUEA, that renting facilities was not ideal and, in the long term, would cost more money and provide fewer options than would ownership of a dedicated facility. Indeed, the idea that East African rugby should have its own ground and headquarters was first put forward in 1930 and these early plans even went as far as identifying and inspecting a parcel of land in the Westlands area of Nairobi. Records do not indicate why this plan did not ultimately see the light of day. By the beginning of the 1950s however, the required motivation, determination, expertise and good fortune were in conjunction and the Union was able to construct the stadium, and within ten years, RFUEA had saved enough money that it was able that it was able to begin loaning money to member clubs for the upgrading of their own grounds. Funding In 1951 the Kenya government granted the union the plot of bundu (rough ground) adjacent to the Ngong Road. Individuals and clubs donated money and sweepstakes and dances were held by the member clubs in order to raise further funds. Life seats were also sold that entitle the holders to free entry to all rugby union matches at the ground, and a seat in the central section of the main stand, for life. Additionally a 10-year loan of ¬£7500 was obtained from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) after 40 members of the Rugby Patrons Society provided personal guarantees; ten guarantors provided surety for ¬£300 and a further 30 for ¬£100 each which, in 1951 when ¬£300 was equivalent to average annual earnings in the UK, was a considerable statement of support. This loan had been secured by D.M. Goldstein (then President of both the RFUEA and Kenya Harlequins) whilst on leave in the United Kingdom. It was the first loan ever made by the RFU to an overseas union. There is an apocryphal story that it was paid off in three years by the simple expedient of taking out rain insurance with some London based companies; if more than an inch of rain fell in each year the policies would pay out. Not so much buying insurance as placing a bet, and in betting terms this would be a racing certainty. Unfortunately the story is not true, insurance companies have never been so na√Øve concerning weather conditions in tropical climes. In fact the loan and its interest was repaid entirely from the annual subscriptions of the members of the Rugby Patrons Society. Kenya Harlequins, the tenant club, and Impala RFC, on the neighbouring ground, between them paid for the drilling of a bore-hole on the Impala grounds, the water from this well being used to irrigate the pitches on both grounds. Design and Construction The grading of the ground (carried out primarily by John Webster who donated hours of his time to driving the bulldozer) was carried out towards the end of 1953 but the grass planted for the short rains that year failed. The grass was re-planted in time for the long rains of 1954 and that crop was successful. The next step was to erect the 60 foot (18 m) goal-posts, in order to serve as a visual advertisement that something was happening, and to fence in the ground to prevent damage by livestock and casual pedestrians across the pitch. Bougainvillia shrubs were laid along the fence, four rows of trees were planted on the Eastern side of the ground to act as a windbreak and the car-park was levelled. The Stadium was designed by John Tanner (Kenya Harlequins and East Africa) and the building works were carried out by a firm belonging to a member of the Rugby Patrons Society at a very reasonable cost. The stadium and the majority of the seating was placed on the western side of the ground such that in the early evening (when matches are normally played in East Africa) the spectators are not looking into the sun. The pavilion was designed for easy expansion; it consisted originally of two changing-rooms, showers, toilets, a small bar, seating for 200 and housing for the family of the custodian/bar-man. Within ten years it had been expanded to include a full-sized bar, committee-room, kitchen, seating for 3000 and a camera-tower/broadcasting-box on the roof of the main stand. In recent years the changing facilities have been further expanded. On the eastern side of the ground an earthen mound runs along the length of the touch-line and there is a tier of five rows of simple stepped seats constructed from breeze-block material and concrete. This simple form of seating is replicated on the western touch-line and it is above this that the main stadium sits. The pavilion consists of three sections, the northern and southern sections, each approximately 30m wide, are larger than the central life-members' section which is approximately 10m wide. All three of these sections have seven rows of seating on wooden staging and are covered by corrugated asbestos roofing. Either side of the main pavilion are a further six rows of concrete benches which in recent years have been covered with a mabati (corrugated metal) roof. Opening The first match played at the ground was East Africa versus the British Lions on 28 September 1955. It attracted a gate (with borrowed seating) of 6000 and J.A.E. Siggins, the manager of the Lions, was given the honour of opening the ground in the presence of His Excellency Sir Evelyn Baring, the Governor of Kenya. Upgrading In October 2009 the Rugby Patrons Society donated KSh 1.2 millionKRFU Newsletter, October 2009 (equal to ¬£10,600 or ‚Ç¨11,800 or US$16,000) to the KRFU thus providing 60% of the funds required to sink a borehole in order to ensure that the pitch can be maintained in excellent condition. Then on 29 May 2010, the Safaricom foundation gave KSh13.2 million (equal to ¬£123,000 or ‚Ç¨143,000 or US$177,000) to the KRFU for the rehabilitation and expansion of the ground to seat an additional 1,500 people on a brand new terrace on the Ngong Road side of the ground. The Kenya Rugby Football Union plans to purchase an adjacent plot, the Unga grounds, so that the stadium can be expanded to accommodate 20,000 people with state-of-the-art facilities.Business Daily, 25 August 2009 : Safari Sevens success It is the intention of the Ground Development Committee to create a venue that will enable Kenya to host a major International Rugby Board event in the near future. Notes a. The RFUK was dissolved in 1953 with the formation of the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA); the current Kenya Rugby Football Union (KRFU) was not formed until 1970.

The dictionary is not founded upon any earlier dictionary, but derives from original research. After decades of preparatory work, work on the dictionary itself was begun in 1965, and it was published in fascicules between 1975 and 2013. In 2016 the complete work was put online. A consolidated reprint in three volumes was published in 2018. History In 1913, Robert Whitwell, a prolific contributor to the Oxford English Dictionary, petitioned the British Academy to use the imminent International Congress of Historical Studies to propose a replacement for the standard dictionary of medieval Latin, Du Cange's Glossarium (1678).Robert Jowitt Whitwell, \\"Mediaeval Latin\\", letter to The Spectator, 1 February 1913. Whitwell's idea was taken up in 1920 by the new International Union of Academies, which decided in 1924 that member academies should produce dictionaries based on those medieval Latin texts produced in geographic areas corresponding to their respective present-day territories, whilst also furnishing the material for an international Novum Glossarium.Union Acad√©mique Internationale project page To this end, the British Academy appointed two committees to direct the collection of quotations, one covering the sixth to eleventh centuries for the Novum Glossarium and the other covering 1066 to 1600 for a dictionary of \\"late medieval British Latin\\". By 1932 the Academy felt that they could usefully publish the first fruits of the project, which appeared in 1934 as the Medieval Latin Word-List from British and Irish Sources, prepared by J. H.

Born in Philadelphia, Bateman received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1946, under the supervision of Hans Rademacher. After temporary positions at Yale University and the Institute for Advanced Study, he joined in 1950 the mathematics department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was department chair for 15 years and was subsequently an emeritus professor. He was the doctoral advisor of 20 students, including Marvin Knopp, Kevin McCurley, and George B. Purdy. Bateman was a member of the American Mathematical Society for 71 years. He served as an Associate Secretary for 16 years, a member of the Board of Trustees for 4 years, and a member of the Mathematical Reviews Committee for 5 years.American Mathematical Society Lists of Past Officers Textbooks Bateman was a coauthor of Analytic Number Theory: An Introductory Course. He was also a contributor to the second edition of the textbook Elementary Number Theory, a translation into English of Edmund Landau's German language text Elementare Zahlentheorie.Elementary Number Theory. Edmund Landau; translated by Jacob E. Goodman, with exercises by Paul T. Bateman and Eugene E. Kohlbecker. Chelsea Publishing, 1966, reprinted by the American Mathematical Society, 1999. . Other information Bateman attended Upper Moreland High School, which recognized his accomplishments by inducting him into its Hall of Fame in 1999. He was Department Head for 15 years and had a flair for the dramatic, which led to his being called P. T. Barnum. In the Christmas skit one year the students had a character called Batman, with aluminum foil on his head to simulate baldness. Not to be outdone, at the following year's skit Bateman himself appeared in a Batman costume. As department head, Bateman was a great believer in the committee of one because it made committee meetings unnecessary. Ph.D. candidates had to pass an oral exam in either German, Russian or French. It happened that Prof. Philippe Tondeur was fluent in those 3 languages, and so Bateman gave him the job of examining all the candidates. Bateman served as Problems editor of the American Mathematical Monthly from 1986 to 1991. His first act was to solve all the problems in the backlog. He visited the Institute for Advanced Study three times.

Today it is common as a measure of refinement‚Äîdisplaying good taste, wisdom and subtlety rather than crudeness, stupidity and vulgarity. In the perception of social class, sophistication can be linked with concepts such as status, privilege and superiority. Note for example:  Scope of sophistication  In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class. Sophistication can be seen as \\"a form of snobbery,\\" or as \\"among the most desirable of human qualities.\\" A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in elegance and fashion, covering the art of \\"[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne.\\" History In Ancient Greece, sophia was the special insight of poets and prophets. This then became the wisdom of philosophers such as sophists. But their use of rhetoric to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading. The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King Louis XIV (reigned 1643‚Äì1715). For example: The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic sensibilities and refined elegance of Regency dandies such as Beau Brummell (1778‚Äì1840) became fashionable and admired.  Types of sophistication  Recognised varieties of sophistication include: * cultural sophistication For example: (or culturedness) * intellectual sophistication For example: In the analysis of humor, Victor Raskin distinguishes \\"two types of sophistication: limited access or allusive knowledge, and complex processing\\".  Acquiring sophistication  Methods of acquiring the appearance of personal sophistication include: * educational travel ‚Äì note the function of the traditional Grand Tour for European aesthetes * Finishing school On a societal level commentators can associate various forms of sophistication with civilization.

Cohen (January 17, 1934 ‚Äì October 12, 2020) was a civil liberties attorney and Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates. On April 10, 1967, with co-counsel Philip Hirschkop, he presented oral argument for the petitioners in Loving v. Virginia before the U. S. Supreme Court.Oral Argument recording On June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Cohen's clients, declaring bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional, thus invalidating the anti-miscegenation laws of 15 states. Early life and career Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant Jewish fur worker who was active in a local union. In an interview, Cohen associated his father's union activities with his own respect for working people and his status as a historically oppressed minority as an impetus for furthering equal rights. He attended City College of New York, and law school at Georgetown University. In the 1960s he helped found the Virginia unit of the American Civil Liberties Union.\\"Passage Marks Atypical Legislator's Victory\\", Daily Press, Newport News, Virginia, pg. 18, 22 February 1983 Loving vs. Virginia On April 10, 1967, only a few years out of law school, Cohen argued as a volunteer cooperating attorney for the ACLU on behalf of the petitioners Richard and Mildred Loving in the case of Loving v. Virginia before the Supreme Court of the United States. Cohen's co-counsel was fellow Virginian Philip Hirschkop, who had also recently completed law school at Georgetown. Richard Loving was a white construction worker, and Mildred was of both black and native American origins according to her attorneys, though in 2004 she claimed Native American-Rappahannock and not African ethnic origins. They were married in Washington, D.C. in 1958, and after returning to their home in Caroline County, Virginia, six weeks after their marriage, they were arrested and charged with violating interracial marriage laws, a felony carrying one to five years. At the time of their wedding, twenty-four states banned interracial marriage. The couple were sentenced to one year in prison, but their sentence was suspended on condition that they leave the state for 25 years. At one point according to attorney Hirschkop, Mildred, though five months pregnant and the mother of a young child, was held in a small dirty jail cell for the better part of a month. After the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Mildred wrote U.S Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, inquiring if the law could allow her and her husband to live in Virginia. Kennedy forwarded the letter to the ACLU office in Washington. =Supreme Court ruling on Loving vs. Virginia= thumbU.S states, by the date of repeal of anti-miscegenation laws: On June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court rendered its unanimous decision overturning a Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruling in favor of the state to create and enforce racial marriage laws known as anti-miscegenation laws. The decision validated that interracial marriage bans were unconstitutional and their existence in some states and not others denied the couple equal protection under the law guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. Most significantly, it reversed the right of states to create laws which banned interracial marriage or enforce such laws where they existed.\\"Interracial Marriage Ban Case is Argued\\", Tampa Bay Times, St. Petersburg, Florida, pg. 12, 11 April 1967 The Supreme Court ruling voided the existing interracial marriage laws of 15 mostly Southern states, including all the states of the former Confederacy. A few states, notably Alabama, continued to have bans on interracial marriage on the books, though they could no longer be enforced. Alabama did not officially reverse its ban on interracial marriage until 2000 in a special election that struck the mention of anti-miscegenation from the state constitution. After the Loving ruling, it continued to enforce its interracial marriage laws until 1970. Richard Loving died aged 41 in 1975 in Caroline County, Virginia, killed by a drunk driver. Mildred Loving died of pneumonia on May 2, 2008, in Milford, Virginia, aged 68. Work as a representative to the Virginia House of Delegates From 1980 to 1996, Cohen served as a representative to the Virginia House of Delegates. Work with the Virginia House of Delegates 21st district As a freshman delegate in 1980, Cohen sponsored a controversial measure to decriminalize homosexuality in Virginia, a traditionally conservative state. Not surprisingly, the bill failed. Work with the Virginia House of Delegates 56th district From January 12, 1983 to January 10, 1996, Cohen served as a representative of the 46th district of the Virginia House of Delegates. The 56th district consisted largely of the city of Alexandria, not far from the nation's capital. =Nuclear freeze resolution, 1983= In early 1983, Cohen backed a Nuclear Freeze Resolution before the Virginia State Senate Rules Committee, which ultimately was voted down 10-4 on February 8. Cohen's resolution decried the \\"huge sums of money being spent testing, producing, and deploying nuclear warheads and weapons\\" and the strain it placed on the rest of the federal budget. It further called for bi-lateral talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to begin a freeze on the production of such weapons. The chief critic of the Bill was Bernard F. Halloran, a special assistant to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\\"Nuclear Freeze Proposal Gets Cold Shoulder\\", Daily Press, Newport News, Virginia, pg. 12, 19 February 1983 Many of Cohen's bills were not related to civil liberties, but were designed to favor defendants or plaintiffs in legal proceedings and were written in complex legal language. A large number of Cohen's bills were designed to benefit people who filed personal injury cases in Virginia courts.Ebert, Bruce C., \\"Passage Marks Atypical Legislator's Victory\\", Daily Press, Newport News, Virginia, pg. 18, 22 February 1983 =Death with dignity bill, 1983= In early 1983, the Virginia House passed Cohen's \\"Death with Dignity\\" bill. The measure allowed terminally ill patients to determine whether they wanted to go through \\"heroic artificial means to keep their bodies alive when there was no hope of recovery\\". On February 21 1983, the Virginia Senate passed the \\"Natural Death Act,\\" which relieved physicians of criminal and civil liability once they, with the consent of the terminally ill patient or that person's family, disconnected regulators.\\" The bill required that the patient be in terminal condition, and that there must be \\"no reasonable expectation of recovery\\". Doctors who felt they could not morally comply with the wishes of the terminally ill patient or family member to disconnect the patient's regulator could transfer the care of the patient to another doctor.Ebert, Bruce C., \\"Governor Likely to Sign Death Bill Into Law\\", Daily Press, Newport News, Virginia, pg. 18, 22 February 1983 In February 1984, Cohen strongly opposed a bill that prevented young men who had not registered with the selective service from attending state colleges and receiving financial aid. The bill passed the Virginia House with a vote of 67-33, but had yet to be brought before the Virginia Senate.\\"Bill Hits Draft Resisters\\", The Burlington Free Press, Burlington, Vermont, pg. 2, 16 February 1984 Cohen co-authored a blog entry in 2007 for the Huffington Post about the legal standing of same sex marriage. Portrayal in television and movies Cohen has been portrayed as a character in multiple dramatizations of the Loving case. In the 1996 TV movie Mr. & Mrs. Loving, he was played by Corey Parker. In the 2016 film Loving, he is played by Nick Kroll.

It is both a department and professional school of Wheaton College. It currently has 21 full-time faculty members and approximately 200 undergraduate music majors, and is fully accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music. The Conservatory also operates a Community School of the Arts, serving the music and arts education needs of the surrounding community. Academics The Conservatory offers both the Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Music Education degrees. Majors for the Bachelor of Music include composition, history/literature, pedagogy, performance (orchestral instruments, organ, piano, and voice), and elective studies in an outside field. The Bachelor of Music Education degree offers emphases in choral or instrumental music. The Conservatory seeks to train its students in four broad areas: composition, performance, teaching, and scholarship. All music degrees require a core of music theory, ear training, and music history. Performance studies are an integral part of the curriculum: all degrees require regular jury examinations on major instruments and participation in large ensembles. This broad approach reflects the liberal arts context of the whole of Wheaton College, of which the Conservatory is a constituent academic unit. The Conservatory also offers a Bachelor of Arts in Music program, which combines 40 hours of music classes with the liberal arts general education track. A music minor is also available. Administration and faculty In 2008, Dr. Michael Wilder was appointed Wheaton's Dean of the Conservatory, Art, and Communication. Upon his arrival, the administrative structure of the Conservatory was reorganized to reflect its duality as both a department of the College and a professional school.

A recent, related addition to the program are the jazz combos. Facilities The Conservatory complex consists of four buildings on Wheaton's main campus in Wheaton, Illinois. Edman Memorial Chapel In addition to holding undergraduate chapel services and numerous large special events such as Commencement and the annual Talent Show, Edman Memorial Chapel is the Conservatory's primary large ensemble performance venue. The auditorium seats 2400 and houses a 70 rank Casavant organ, Opus 3796, installed in 2001. A backstage addition was completed in 2009 including a new instrumental rehearsal hall and instructional space for harp, harpsichord, percussion, and string bass. McAlister Hall Built in the 1960s, McAlister Hall housed classrooms, practice rooms, the department offices, and many teaching studios until 2017, when most functions were moved to the newly renovated Armerding Center. Pierce Chapel Built in the 1920s in a joint venture between Wheaton College and College Interdenominational Church of Christ, Pierce Chapel now serves as the Conservatory's recital hall. The building's lower level houses organ practice rooms, teaching studios, the music technology lab, and two large classrooms, and the upper level, above the recital hall, houses offices for the Community School of the Arts. In addition to serving as the venue for student and faculty performers, the recital hall is also used for student prayer and worship services throughout the year. In 2011, a two-manual, seventeen-rank mechanical-action organ built by Charles Hendrickson was donated to Wheaton and installed in the rear of the chapel. Armerding Center for Music and the Arts The former Armerding Science Center at the northern end of campus began an extensive renovation culminating in the opening of the new Armerding Center for Music and the Arts in October 2017. As of late 2017, many functions previously housed in McAlister Hall and Pierce Chapel have been moved into the new building.

He is best known for his work in developing alternative experimental procedures for use by the blind and vision impaired, and for his early innovation in the field of induction coils. Biography Hearder was born in Plymouth, Devon on 24 December 1809, the son of Jonathan Hearder (1775‚Äì1838, an umbrella maker and police constable) and Mary Hannah Hearder (n√©e Parry). He was the eldest of four children, with one brother (George Parry Hearder) and two sisters (Mary Hannah Treleaven and Anne Eliza Page). Hearder became interested in science at an early age, despite his father being \\"greatly averse to such pursuits\\". From the age of 17 Hearder gave lectures on topics of science at the Exeter Literary Institution and other local societies, including the Plymouth Institution (now The Plymouth Athenaeum), of which he was a member. He began a career as a schoolmaster, and was the first schoolmaster in Plymouth to include science as a subject in the school curriculum. In 1830, at the age of 23, Hearder's vision was severely damaged during an accidental explosion while experimenting with the explosive compound silver fulminate. He was frequently described by many (including himself) as totally blind, although John Charles Bucknill in his book The Medical Knowledge of Shakespeare relates a demonstration given by Hearder in which Hearder claimed to be able to perceive a particularly bright flash of electrical light. It became Hearder's practice to wear green spectacles to conceal his damaged eyes. Following the damage to his eyes, Hearder's school closed, and Hearder briefly turned to a secondary career in music. However, despite his vision impairment, Hearder continued lecturing and continued to work in experimental science, most particularly in the field of electrical engineering. He began work on developing alternative experimental procedures which did not rely on visual cues. On 27 October 1837 Hearder married Susan Plimsaul. She died two years later in 1839. On 21 January 1840 he married his cousin Joanna Sleep Hearder (1809‚Äì1887), with whom he went on to have five children. In 1838 Hearder's father died and Hearder assumed control of his father's umbrella-making business. He expanded the business to include the making of fishing tackle, an area in which he developed a strong reputation. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry he \\"could prescribe the particular fly to be used for successful troutfishing in any month, and for any stream in Devonshire.\\" It was in this capacity that he was asked, late in life, to consult on the fishing gear that was to be used by the Challenger expedition, and in fact the expedition eventually set sail bearing trammels and trawls furnished by Hearder for use in collecting shore fish for scientific purposes. In 1845 Hearder was appointed consulting electrician and galvanist to the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital. In 1846, Hearder's mother died, aged 69, at the family house in Frankfort Street. Hearder reportedly had an excellent memory, and held a passion for matters connected with local antiquity and history. He was an active member of the Devonshire Association and the Royal Polytechnic Society. In 1871 Hearder reportedly received the degrees of PhD and DSc although it is not known which institution issued the qualifications. On 16 July 1876, at the age of 67, Hearder died of a sudden paralytic seizure while at 13 Princess Square, Plymouth. He was buried at Ford Park, Plymouth. Inventions Jonathan Nash Hearder's design for a submarine telegraph cable, circa 1850. Throughout his life, Hearder undertook significant work on the development of the induction coil. Although the invention of the induction coil is generally attributed to Heinrich Ruhmkorff, by some accounts Hearder may have independently invented the device at an earlier date. Hearder's son on one occasion vouched that he had personally conveyed his father to London to demonstrate a coil to Michael Faraday a full two years prior to the announcement of Ruhmkorff's design. In 1853 and 1854 Hearder exhibited \\"an induction coil, constructed by himself, with a condensor which he also made himself, on principles which he had worked out [..] which gave with 4 cells of Groves's battery, better results than were obtained with the best instruments constructed by Ruhmkorff at that time.\\" In September 1856, Hearder was awarded the first Silver Medal of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society for his exhibition of \\"an arrangement of primary and secondary wires, with which sparks were obtained in air, and discharges several inches long, through rarefied air, and with which Leyden jars were charged.\\" This induction coil represented a substantial improvement over Heinrich Ruhmkorff's more famous 1851 design, using one-third the wire and generating a significantly greater effect. Hearder was the inventor in 1842 of a magnetometer, which he created with the object of ascertaining the rate of magnetic development in iron. This development also earned him a silver medal from the Polytechnic Society. Hearder was an early advocate of the practicality of laying intercontinental submarine telegraph cables. He was asked to consult on the Atlantic Cable circa 1850, and proposed an improved design which used gutta percha as an insulator, a design which he later patented and a modified version of which was ultimately used in that project. He was later consulted again when the cable was stored at Keyham Dock in Plymouth over the winter of 1857-58, after the failure of the first attempt to lay it August 1857 and before the (briefly) successful attempt in August 1858. Hearder also invented several specialised forms of stove. Work on alternative experimental procedures During his life Hearder developed many alternative experimental procedures which were usable by those with sight impairments. These procedures included steadily moving a paper strip through an induction coil's spark gap, enabling him to feel perforation holes and thus estimate the coil's frequency, which also sounded as an audible tone. In 1858, when Hearder was asked to advise on the faulty Atlantic Cable prior to the departure of the cable ship Agamenmnon from Plymouth's Keyham Dockyard, Hearder reported testing the cable by inserting his tongue into the 2500-mile- long circuit to determine the electrical resistance of the wire. Bibliography Over the course of his career, Hearder published several books and pamphlets, including: *On some new statical and thermal effects of the induction coil, with a new instrument for registering a rapid succession of electrical discharges, and a comparison of the effects of the induction coil with those of frictional and hydro-electric machines (1856), self- published *On the difference in the amount of electricity developed by equal surfaces of cylinder and plate electrical machines (1858), self-published *The degeneration of our sea fisheries (1870), self-published *Guide to sea fishing and the rivers of South Devon: and descriptive catalogue of his prize river and sea fishing tackle, cricket, archery, croquet, &c.;, &c; (1873), self- published See also *Elizabeth Cavicchi, \\"Blind Experimenting in a Sighted World: The Electrical Innovations of Jonathan Nash Hearder\\", Proceedings of the Plymouth Athenaeum, X, 2004/2007, 39‚Äì48.

History = Origin of the name  There is no historical significance to the name, other than that its location is on the sunnier, south slope of the \\"uplands\\" of Surrey, on the Semiahmoo peninsula.  First Nations and the Semiahmoo Trail  Semiahmoo Trail Pedestrian Overpass over 148th Street As traders, the original Coast Salish peoples since the last Ice Age established communities at the mouths of the local rivers, the Nicomekl, Serpentine, and Campbell Rivers, which connected them to inland communities. As the forebears of the present Semiahmoo First Nation faced raids from northern First Nations' groups, they used what came to be known as the Sunnyside area as access to a fort built in the 1830s on what is now the Ocean Park bluffs.HistoryLink.Org Semiahmoo people history The Semiahmoo also used a route across the Sunnyside area of South Surrey to cross the ridge between the Campbell River to the south and Mud Bay to the north, where the Nicomekl and Serpentine were. By 1890 this was called the Semiahmoo Trail.  Telegraph Trail (The Collins Overland Telegraph)  The Telegraph Trail was built along this route in 1865 meant as part of a telegraph linkage from the mainland-USA through Alaska and Siberia to Europe. Initially it was known as The Collins Overland Trail, and the first message carried on it to New Westminster was to report the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in April 1865. The line reached New Westminster from the USA in June 1865. It also provided access from the Nicomekl River a few miles north, to the Boundary Commission Camp located at the mouth of the Little Campbell River at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The Boundary Commission Camp had been established in 1858. The Semiahmoo Wagon Road was built in 1872-4 to connect the Fraser River to the north with Blaine, Washington, to the south. In 1878, stage service on the Semiahmoo Trail increased to twice weekly, between Brown‚Äôs Landing and the border to the south. In 1882 the Canadian Customs Department established the first near-border facility, an ‚Äúout-port‚Äù customs office at Elgin north of the Sunnyside area. This was located where the Semiahmoo Trail met the Nicomekl River and operated until 1891. When the railway was relocated to Hazelmere to the east of Sunnyside, the land crossing at Douglas, B.C./Blaine, Washington, became the main customs area. Led by then Alderman Garry Watkins, in 1977 the (then) District of Surrey proclaimed it a Designated Heritage site. South of 24th Avenue, the present trail deviates slightly from the original route, but on 148 Street there is a specially constructed \\"Semiahmoo Trail\\" pedestrian overpass keeping the trail intact.  European homesteading and road building  James Crutchley homesteaded in 1894 at what is now the corner of Sunnyside Road (24th Avenue) and the Coast Meridian Road. William B. Stokes settled in 1913 near where the present 20th Avenue (Stokes Road) crosses the Semiahmoo Trail. In 1917 Apex Logging operated between Sunnyside Road and Stokes Road near the old Pacific Coast Highway. In 1918, there was still land available for pre-emption in the Sunnyside area and John Holttum chose a site west of what became Stayte Road (160 Street), along Oliver Road (28 Avenue). The social focus, after the early 1920s, was Hazelmere Hall, built by the volunteer labour of local residents on land donated by carpenter Ernest Hamel. Residents recall parties at the hall, dancing to the music of pianist Andy Westland and his orchestra. In 1927 what was to become the King George Highway was built through the area. Construction Camp 205 was situated at Sunnyside Road and worked southeast to the Peace Arch from there. A building from Camp 206 was moved to what is now 24th Avenue and 156th Street to serve as the Sunnyside Hall on land donated by George Cook. Sunnyside United Church held its first service in 1949 in the Sunnyside Hall. In 1958 the City of White Rock seceded from the District of Surrey and the effect was immediately felt in the Sunnyside area. The White Rock-Sunnyside Fire Department hall #13 relocated from what is now the corner of 16th Avenue and 152nd Street (the new municipal border) up to Sunnyside Road (24th Avenue) in the 15300 block. This became known as the Sunnyside Fire Department.Surrey Firefighters Association In 1962 the present route of Highway #99 bisected the Sunnyside area, running from 8th Avenue in South Surrey, along the north side of Mud Bay, to the North Arm of the Fraser River. The opening of the Massey Tunnel on Highway #99 in 1962 and the Alex Fraser Bridge in 1986 enabled access to centres north of the Fraser River and in turn initiated suburban housing booms in the Sunnyside area which are still underway.  Sunnyside Acres Urban Forest  Entrance to Sunnyside Acres Urban Forest at 24th Ave. (Sunnyside Road) The Sunnyside Acres Urban Forest is a second growth forest bounded on the east by 148th Street and bisected by 24th Avenue. The southern boundary is 20th Avenue and the forest's western limit is 140th street to 24th Avenue. It was created in 1988 by city by-law. The Sunnyside Acres Heritage Society arranges guided tours of the many trails some of which are wheelchair accessible. At the south end are large softball diamonds and a hockey rink where the Surrey Eagles junior team plays.  Geography  Sunnyside is located centrally on the uplands and mainly towards the plateau and south slope of the Semiahmoo Peninsula. Sunnyside borders the neighbourhoods of Crescent Beach and Ocean Park to the west, the city of White Rock to the south, the historic areas of Elgin and Mud Bay to the north and the new commercial retail area of Grandview Heights to the east. King George Highway (Highway #99A) bisects the eastern part of the area from the northwest to southeast as it runs to the United States border.  Economy  Logging came to the South Surrey region in 1886City of Surrey community profiles after the Gilley brothers had opened their mill at Elgin in 1885. The brothers were the first to use horses for the transportation of logs, sometimes using 24-horse teams.Elgin area of Surrey Up until then hand-logging with oxen was typical. From 1887-1889 a railway spur line for Royal City Planing Mills came into the Sunnyside area from the east, and from 1917-1920 a spur line came in from Crescent Beach. Skid roads were used to run logs down to the Serpentine, Nicomekl, and Campbell Rivers by horse team. By 1904 the best and most accessible timber was exhausted. In May 1890 a post office opened, with J.A. Cartheau serving as postmaster. It closed in 1891, after the New Westminster and Southern Railway commenced operation, providing direct service to a series of stations along the line.Surrey Community profile Sunnyside In 1964 the Surrey Bus Service operated out of a depot at 24th and King George Highway. This included local bus service as well as into Vancouver. In 1974 the company merged with BC Transit. Though now mainly residential, Sunnyside has a growing retail and business sector. In the early 1980s the Semiahmoo Shopping Centre was opened on the north side of North Bluff Road at Johnson Road (16th Avenue and 152nd Street) and in 1990 a shopping centre was located at Peninsula Village on 24th Avenue.

The Council stressed the urgent situation in Georgia created by the large numbers of displaced people from Abkhazia and the right for them to return home. It also reaffirmed the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia. Both parties were urged to resume negotiations as soon as possible towards a political settlement and the political status of Abkhazia based on the principles set out in previous Security Council resolutions, so that the possibility of a peacekeeping force could be considered. The international community was asked to contribute to Georgia to enable it to overcome the consequences of the conflict. After extending UNOMIG's mandate, it urged the parties in Georgia to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel and allow it freedom of movement. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was then requested to report back to the Council by 21 June 1994, on the progress of the negotiations and the situation on the ground, paying attention to circumstances that may warrant the necessity for a peacekeeping force.

He is portrayed by Jack O'Connell. In the third series, his true emotions are explored and it is revealed that his womanising violent lifestyle is in fact a smoke screen to cover up his real emotions. His actions often cause trouble and create havoc, affecting those around him. However, in the fourth series, he begins to change his ways after a conversation with his solicitor and when he begins to realise the consequences of his actions, most notably witnessing his younger brother beginning to follow in his footsteps. His life is then taken in a wholly other direction when he investigates the disappearance of his best friend in series four's final episodes. Characterisation Cook is an outgoing, sexually promiscuous, and in many ways self-destructive young man, who appears to have come from a troubled family background. He is an impulsive 17-year-old at the start of the series. He loves to have a good time and is constantly the life and soul of any party. Cook shows a great interest in the ladies, and all his partying can sometimes get out of hand, leading him into trouble. He loves to drink and use drugs, but whether or not he is an addict is left ambiguous to the viewers. Throughout the series, he is best friends with both Freddie and JJ, although at times, his sexual relationship with Effy Stonem drives a rift between them. Despite his self-destructive lifestyle, Cook is sometimes caring and kind-hearted - as seen in his fondness for JJ, and his kindness to Naomi and Pandora when they are in tough times. Character history=Series 3 In \\"Everyone\\", Cook, Freddie and JJ meet Effy the morning before they start college, all instantly falling for her. During roll-call the first day, Cook flirts with Naomi, who ignores his attempts. Effy sets Cook and Freddie a challenge: whoever breaks the college rules gets to ‚Äúknow her better‚Äù. Cook breaks the rules, to the point of starting a fire. His reward is sex with Effy in the nurse's office. In \\"Cook\\", Cook invites the gang to his uncle's pub to celebrate his seventeenth birthday which he believes will be a wild, drink- fueled event, but it backfires. The girls decide to leave after Pandora throws up. Cook persuades them otherwise, promising drugs. Freddie gets a call from his sister, Karen, who is at her friend Kayleigh's engagement party. Cook rounds the gang up and they head over there uninvited. Cook flirts with Kayleigh, and starts passing out drugs to his friends. He ends up angering Johnny White, Kayleigh's father and a Bristol drug lord. Cook gets beaten up and the rest of the gang leave with him. Cook then drags JJ to a brothel after an argument with Freddie. There they find Johnny White. Cook taunts and injures him. Johnny vows to kill Cook next time he sees him. In \\"Pandora\\", Cook crashes Pandora's party and has sex with Effy in a closet. While they were having sex they fell back into Pandora's next-door neighbour's room., where they came across a video of Pandora's mum having sex with the next-door neighbour. Then, Pandora comes out of the bathroom upset, by which point Cook is the only other person in the house. When Pandora expresses unhappiness that she never got to do the activities she wanted that night - play Twister and learn about human sexuality from her friends - Cook offers to play the game with her out of pity. He then offers to have sex with her, and they spend a while together as the sun rises above Bristol. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. After an argument, Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behaviour, belongs to no one. In \\"Freddie\\", Freddie gets tired of living in the shadow of the increasingly reckless Cook. Freddie is annoyed by Cook crashing his shed right when he is beginning to bond with Effy, and Effy rejects Cook's offer for sex. Cook and Freddie begin to patch their differences at a pub quiz, although JJ accidentally reveals that Cook slept with Freddie's sister Karen, which Freddie is horrified by. In retaliation for Karen stealing Freddie's shed, Cook convinced everybody at the pub to vote against Karen in the finals of talent show she is a contestant in, although Freddie is infuriated by this due to supporting Karen, and starts a fight with Cook. Although Freddie reveals his true feelings for Effy in the episode, which she reciprocates, she goes back to Cook because she's afraid to love anyone. In \\"Naomi\\", Cook tries again to convince Naomi to have sex with him. She jokingly tells him that he has a better chance of winning the election for student body president. He sees this as a challenge, and registers as a candidate. She launches her own campaign to rival Cook, especially when his campaign turns out to be more about making a spectacle than any actual plans. Yet, their classmates seem to prefer Cook. Naomi is doubly humiliated in front of the form when Cook ridicules her and Emily subsequently stands up for her, and Cook jokes about Emily being her \\"girlfriend.\\" Naomi later witnesses her teachers rigging the votes to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form after she is announced the winner of the elections. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Cook and begins to have sex with him before she realises that it \\"isn't right\\". Cook doesn't make any attempts to force her, as he says she's \\"clever\\" enough to have a reason not to follow through. She leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. In \\"JJ\\", JJ sees his mother, Celia, overwhelmed by all of his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook to tell him how he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. However, when JJ, encouraged by Emily, goes to confront Effy, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that the girl he was having sex with was with Pandora. Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie, and explodes in a violent rage when he realises Cook is indifferent to his feelings. Moved by this, Cook give JJ a hug and tells him that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs, knowing they are designed both to make people relax and become more honest. They then meet their friends at a club. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dance floor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs. Cook, under the influence of JJ's drugs, is compelled to tell the truth and confesses that Effy loves Freddie. Cook says that he loves Effy, but knows his feelings are not reciprocated and that is why he is sleeping with Pandora. In \\"Effy\\", Cook crashes the gang's camping trip, and in anger reveals many of the group's secrets, including the fact that he and Pandora are still sleeping together - which causes Thomas to break up with her. After Effy is ousted from the group, he decides to take her on a road trip, to get away from it all. In \\"Finale\\", Cook and Effy are in self-imposed exile from the gang; they've gone to stay with Cook's father. They are found by JJ and Freddie, who try to bring them back, but soon realise that Cook is beginning to fall in love with Effy. Cook, Freddie and JJ take part in the town's annual steeple chase, the reward for them at the end being Effy, although Cook's father's boat is also part of a wager with another man entering the chase. Neither Cook nor Freddie win, the winner in fact being JJ, resulting in the loss of the boat and Effy. However, JJ chooses to pressure Effy to make a choice between the three boys; her gaze lingers on Freddie, causing Cook to leave in a fit of rage. Towards the end of the episode, Cook goes to his father's boat hoping to leave with him; his father tells him he never wanted him the first place, but Cook, sobbing, still angrily refuses to hand over the keys. His father, exasperated, pulls out a flare and threatens to burn Cook's face off, not caring whether Cook lives or dies, to which Cook replies, \\"I don't, either.\\" Freddie arrives and knocks Cook's father unconscious before he can do any harm to Cook. Freddie asks Cook to say it's okay for him to be with Effy; Cook says he can't do it because he loves her, and he's sorry. JJ and Effy arrive, followed by the townspeople hoping to claim Cook's dad's boat. But Cook, JJ, Freddie and Effy quickly set sail. Cook's dad awakes to them setting sail, and upon realises that his boat is safe shouts \\"I'm Cook!\\" in an antagonistic manner at Cook and his friends. Cook then shouts back at his father, \\"No, I'm Cook!\\" and pushes him off the boat. As they sail away toward Bristol, the episode ends with Freddie asking, \\"So, what do we do now?\\" Series 4 In \\"Thomas\\", The gang, excluding Effy, witness the suicide of a teenage girl, Sophia, after she had taken drugs. Depressed, Thomas gets drunk and attacks Cook after Cook taunts him about his infidelity with Pandora, still convinced that Cook sold Sophia the drugs. This leads to Naomi admitting that Cook gave her the drugs, which Naomi later gave to Sophia. In \\"Emily\\", Emily learns that Naomi was dealing powder with Cook the night of the suicide and sold some to Sophia to pay for the motorbike goggles she bought her. Cook sees Effy and Freddie kissing at the party and takes his anger out on a fellow party-goer, severely beating him and ends up accidentally headbutting JJ also. In \\"Cook\\", Cook is in prison, charged with Grievous Bodily Harm for beating up Shanky Jenkins at the house party. Duncan, Cook's legal aid, advises him to plead guilty, but Cook pleads not guilty instead. He is released from prison with an electronic tag and sent to live with his mother, Ruth, a famous artist. At home, Cook bonds with his younger brother Paddy who adores him, but clashes with his vain and perpetually drunken mother. Cook is expelled from college. He visits Naomi who informs him they must deal with their guilt over Sophia. Afterwards Duncan tells Cook there is no case and that he should grow up. Cook visits his mother's art exhibit and is shocked to learn that she had a brief sexual relationship with Freddie. Freddie admits Ruth gave him a blow job at Cook's 15th birthday party and pleads for Cook to stop acting out. Cook argues with his mother, leaves the house with Paddy and steals Ruth's car, trashing it. Cook has a moment of insight when he sees his brother acting like him. He finds Naomi and has a heart-to-heart, bonding over how they both love someone. He then goes back to his legal aid Duncan and has a breakdown. Afterwards he tells the police he sold Sophia the MDMA, taking the flak for Naomi. Effy visits Cook in prison and tells him she loves Freddie. Cook pleads guilty at trial and is imprisoned. In \\"Freddie\\", after Freddie clears the party out, Cook remains, having apparently escaped from jail prior to the beginning of the episode, saying he couldn't stick being stuck with \\"a million me's anymore\\". However, when seeing him, Effy begins to freak out, yelling at him to leave. Later, Freddie tries to follow a freaked out Effy who ran away from him, but loses sight of her in the large crowd, however he runs into Cook and asks him for help. After Effy attempted suicide, Cook, despite his own feeling for Effy, tells Freddie not to give up on her. In \\"Effy\\", she runs into Cook and after an argument, Cook tells her that he would redo the last two years all over again, and that he still loves her. Effy tells him to piss off and leaves. The next morning, she is at a park, and Cook sits on the bench next to her. As they are talking, Cook mentions that Freddie calls him about her (and calls her \\"Ef\\"). Effy looks confused, asking who \\"Ef\\" is. Cook then asks her what her name is, unsure whether she is joking or not to which she replies \\"Elizabeth\\". Cook then reintroduces himself as James. He takes her to a party, and they talk. Effy mentions that she normally doesn't go on a date with someone she just met. Cook goes along with it, not telling her that they have already met. As they walk down the street, they end up at the street where Tony got hit by a bus. Effy's memory begins to get jogged, and begins remembering. Cook, not understanding that Effy really didn't remember him, tells her that she wins (thinking it was a game). Effy is confused, but Cook tells her that they have met, dated, and had sex. Effy tries to deny it, but Cook brings up things only someone close to her would know. Effy finally remembers her brother being hit, but she begins to freak out. Cook slaps her to \\"wake\\" her up, and Effy wants him to do it again. After pushing Cook, she runs off, with him chasing her. She runs into the freeway and gets almost hit by a car. Cook saves her and she kisses him. Effy remembers everything and tells Cook to get her to Freddie. Cook brings Effy to Freddie and they talk about the relationship between all three of them, they argue when Cook realises Freddie was planning on leaving. He leaves telling Freddie not to screw it up. In \\"Everyone\\", Karen and Cook start to become concerned about Freddie's whereabouts. Karen gives Cook Freddie's notebook which repeatedly says the words \\"I love her\\" regarding Effy, which causes him to visibly sob. Upon reading it again, he notices a part that says \\"John Foster wants to hurt her\\". The police then raid Naomi's house after Cook's ex-girlfriend Arcia tells the police where he is hiding. Cook escapes and goes to Freddie's shed where he meets Effy who has been released from the psychiatric hospital. The rest of the gang meet there and decide to throw a party for Freddie's birthday even though he isn't there. Cook heads outside briefly where he spots a figure observing Freddie's house. He decides to follow. Cook breaks into John's basement where he finds Freddie's blood stained clothes and shoes. Cook then seemingly hears Freddie's ghostly voice warning him to \\"get out\\" before Foster returns, this spooks Cook into turning on a light just as Foster arrives with his baseball bat. John hits him in the stomach almost knocking him to the ground and verbally taunts him. Cook gets up laughing, and admits he is a criminal and has no sense or impulse control, he then tells John that he knows he killed Freddie. As the season ends, he launches himself at Foster, screaming \\"I'm Cook!\\" Series 7 In \\"Rise\\", Cook has been a fugitive for three years, and is now working as a drug dealer in Manchester. When he is asked to help his employer's girlfriend find a house and finds that he is irresistibly attracted to her, he sets off a chain of events which will lead him into a world of savage revenge and a confrontation with his own teenage past. It was revealed in \\"Rise: Part 1\\" that Cook killed John Foster at the end of series 4 and has been on the run ever since. In \\"Rise: Part 2\\", Cook deals with his issues and makes a decision not to kill his employer, who at this point had killed his girlfriend, Emma, and threatened to kill Cook as well, but decides to be the bigger man and walk away.

It is found in southern Europe, Asia Minor, the Ural Mountains, Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Its wingspan is 15‚Äì17 mm. The butterfly's common name comes from the dazzling bright blue colour of male's wings. The larvae feed on Anthyllis vulneraria (kidney vetch). The butterfly flies from May to September in two generations. Habitats include flowery meadows in rocky areas at 500‚Äì2000 m. Description in Seitz L. hylas Esp.

Under the Irish Church Act 1869 it was superseded by the Church Temporalities Commission, to prepare for the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 and deal with subsequent changes in property ownership. Historic monuments were transferred in 1874 to the Board of Public Works. The Irish Church Act Amendment Act, 1881 dissolved the Church Temporalities Commission and transferred its remaining functions to by the Irish Land Commission. History It was founded as a consequence of the Church Temporalities Act 1833. The board consisted of 11 members, 6 episcopal members and 5 lay members, and they had to be members of the Church of Ireland. The six episcopal members were appointed by his Majesty in council and four of them had to be Archbishops or Bishops of Ireland including the archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, where both could appoint a commissioner each. The five lay members included the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Lord Chief Justice to the Kings Bench, if they were members of the Church of Ireland, and three other laymen or clergymen. In the beginning, the four provinces of the established church in Ireland were put under the responsibilities of the architects William Farrell (Armagh), Frederick Darley (Dublin), Joseph Welland (Tuam), and James Pain (Cashel). In 1843, the organization was centralized with Joseph Welland as the leading architect. After his death in 1860, the post was jointly assigned to his son William John Welland and William Gillespie.

Gordon (1944 ‚Äì March 16, 1996) was an American economist and Professor of Economics at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research. He founded the Institute for Labor Education and Research in 1975 and later the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis in New York City. Gordon worked to disseminate progressive economic ideas to the general public and to contribute to the development of a left-political movement in the United States. Gordon's work dealt mainly with discrimination and labor market segmentation. He coined the term social structure of accumulation which gave rise to an extensive body of work on the impact of political, social and economic institutions on long-term investment and growth.  Biography  Gordon was born in Washington, D.C., grew up and went to high school in Berkeley, California and spent his college years at Harvard University, where he was awarded a B.A. in Economics in 1965. His father Robert Aaron Gordon was President of the American Economic Association. His mother Margaret S. Gordon was well known for her contributions to the economics of employment and social welfare policy. His brother Robert J. Gordon is a prominent macroeconomist. As a graduate student of economics at Harvard in the late 1960s, Gordon worked as a research assistant evaluating Great Society programs targeting the hard-core unemployed and was active in the development of the new U.S. school of radical political economy. He completed a doctoral thesis on \\"Class, Productivity, and the Ghetto\\" and earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1971. From 1970 to 1973, he served as a research associate at the National Bureau for Economic Research, then located in New York City. In 1973, he joined the Economics Department at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, where he continued to teach until his untimely death‚Äîfrom congestive heart failure‚Äîat the age of 51. Gordon's career was marked both by an extraordinary range of academic contributions to the field of economics and by his continual commitment to develop and to make available to the general public, economic analyses that could support the work of political activists working for social justice. His academic contributions are reflected in numerous books and articles published in professional journals as well as in his founding and directorship of the Center for Economic Policy Analysis. His contributions to the development of a progressive political movement in the United States include many policy papers, newsletters, op-ed pieces, radio and TV interviews and frequent participation in public discussion forums as well as the founding of the Institute for Labor Education and Research‚Äîsubsequently renamed the Center for Democratic Alternatives‚Äîin New York City. Gordon Hall is the home of the University of Massachusetts Political Economy Research Institute.  Work  Gordon's progressive political commitments were the basic reason for his research activity and determined both its major themes and the manner in which he presented his findings. He addressed most of his research to economic issues of importance to the average person and to workers in particular. He disseminated his research findings not only to professional colleagues in economics journals, but also to a wide popular audience in a highly readable style. In his life and in his work as an economist, Gordon exemplified the waning tradition of the public intellectual. Gordon's work over the three decades since he began graduate study can be divided into three periods, during which he addressed different sets of issues. From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, often working in collaboration with Richard Edwards and Michael Reich, he focused on labor economics and in particular segmented labor markets. During the 1980s, he turned his attention to analysis of the long- term trajectory of the U.S. economy, working with Samuel Bowles and Thomas Weisskopf to develop an historical and institutional approach to macroeconomic analysis that would yield progressive economic policy proposals. Finally from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, Gordon worked to develop a neo-Marxian model of the U.S. macroeconomy and brought to a conclusion his ongoing analysis of the implications of widespread bureaucratic supervision of American workplaces.  Labor economics  As a graduate student, Gordon combined some of his own findings with related work by other economists to write Theories of Poverty and Underemployment (1971), a book that surveyed alternative approaches to problems of urban poverty. His best-known contributions to labor economics challenged the mainstream economic assumption of a unified labor market and argued instead for the recognition of multiple labor markets separated by deep historically-shaped divisions along racial, gender and class lines. Gordon's joint research with Edwards and Reich in this area culminated in the publication of their co-authored and widely cited book, Segmented Work, Divided Workers: The Historical Transformation of Labor in the United States (1982).  Macroeconomic analysis and economic policy  In 1979, Gordon became co-chair of a commission on economic problems set up by the Progressive Alliance‚Äîa political coalition of more than 200 organizations representing labor, citizens, civil rights and women's organizations. He felt that a new and overarching analysis of the U.S. economy was needed in order to understand the macroeconomic travails of the time and to guide proposals for change. This led to more than a decade of collaboration with Samuel Bowles and Thomas Weisskopf in which they first analyzed the post-World War II boom of the U.S. economy as well as its subsequent unraveling and then formulated policy proposals to develop a more democratic, egalitarian and successful U.S. economy in the future. Gordon, Bowles and Weisskopf's account of the unraveling of the postwar boom gives prominence to the institutional and political impact of sustained full employment during the middle-to-late 1960s, the erosion of U.S. world hegemony and the rise of environmental and other citizen movements. In brief, they argue that the boom ended because the institutional structures could no longer restrain the claims of rivals (both domestic and international) against the profits of U.S. corporations and that a new and more just social and economic order would be needed to restore prosperity. Gordon's work with Bowles and Weisskopf led to numerous econometric and historical studies on the dynamics of stagflation, the slowdown of productivity growth and the determinants of profitability and investment which were published in a series of articles in economics journals. The collaboration also led to two co-authored books for a general audience, namely Beyond the Waste Land: A Democratic Alternative to Economic Decline (1983) and After the Waste Land: A Democratic Economics for the Year 2000 (1991).  Macroeconomic modeling and labor control  One of Gordon's most important contributions to the collaborative research he carried out on labor economics and macroeconomic trends was his historical and institutional understanding of the process of economic growth and development. His approach sought to explain successive booms and crises in a capitalist economy in terms of successive institutional frameworks or, to use the neo-Marxian term, successive social structures of accumulation (SSAs). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he sought to use statistical methodology to conduct a rigorous test of this historical-institutional approach. His project involved the specification of four distinct yet comparable econometric models of the U.S. economy, based respectively on the neoclassical, the classical Marxian, the post-Keynesian and his own Nno-Marxian \\"left-structuralist\\" perspective‚Äîthe latter representing a formalization of the SSA approach. From a \\"forecasting tournament\\" among the four models, his own left-structuralist model emerged the winner. Gordon's last five years were devoted also to completing an analysis of the top-heavy bureaucratic structure of U.S. corporations and its relationship to the decline in the real wages of U.S. workers since the mid-1970s‚Äîtwo phenomena on which he had focused attention in his earlier work. This effort culminated in the publication two months after his death of Fat and Mean: The Corporate Squeeze of Working Americans and the Myth of Managerial 'Downsizing' (1996). In this book, Gordon refutes with an impressive array of quantitative evidence much of the conventional wisdom about U.S. corporate management and its relations with workers. He argues that U.S. corporations have gone \\"mean\\" rather than \\"lean\\", employing more managers and supervisors per worker than ever before. He attributes the long-term squeeze on U.S. workers' real wages not so much to increasing international economic integration and increasingly complex technology as to corporate executives' choice of a \\"low-road\\" business strategy, involving the use of discipline and negative sanctions, rather than a \\"high-road\\" strategy, emphasizing positive incentives to motivate work. Always concerned to use understanding of the world in order to change it for the better, Gordon concluded the book with a chapter devoted to policy recommendations designed to promote more democratic and cooperative high-road approaches to labor management.

Since their 2007 launch, Knome‚Äôs sole focus has been on improving lives by applying scientific insights gained from the interpretation of human genomes. Their products and services help their clients identify and classify the variants, genes, and gene sets that are likely to govern or underlie a specific disease, tumor, or drug response. Clients include academic, pharmaceutical and medical researchers. In 2015 it was taken over by Tute Genomics.Knome take over Technology Knome has developed proprietary technologies that automate many of the manual tasks involved in interpreting human whole genomes. These technologies are designed to address the informatics and workflow bottlenecks that typically hinder whole genome interpretation. The company‚Äôs core technology, kGAP, was developed in 2009 and serves as the foundation for a number of Knome‚Äôs products and services including the knoSYS¬Æ platform. Products and services For academic, pharmaceutical, and medical researchers, Knome offers: ;knoSYS¬Æ Platform: Provides labs with a scalable, production-grade informatics system for the analysis, annotation, and interpretation of human next-gen sequence data (genome, exome, targeted gene). ;knomeDISCOVERY: Research services include project-driven curation, sophisticated informatics, and in-depth interpretation by Knome's team of experienced geneticists. Timeline ;2007: Knome was co-founded by George M.

In the show, Knome helped describe how the interpretation of human genomes is helping to solve medical mysteries and revolutionize personal healthcare. ;Faces of America:In September 2011, Knome was featured in the four-part PBS series Faces of America with Henry Louis Gates, Jr. The series followed Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as he used advanced genetics tools to explore the ancestral histories of 12 renowned Americans, uncovering unique stories of immigration that illuminate the American experience. On the program, Knome scientists illuminated the striking \\"mosaic\\" of ancestry in Professor Gates' and his father's genomes, tracing their ancestry to Africa, Europe, and beyond. By comparing the two genomes to each other, they revealed the shared genetic heritage of a father and son, including aspects of their health risks and strengths. Further, by documenting the parts of their genomes that the two men did not share, Knome's analysis offered a glimpse of the genome of Professor Gates' late mother. ;Ozzy Osbourne:In 2010, Knome famously interpreted the genomes of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. The study uncovered notable differences in Ozzy's genes that were linked to drug and alcohol response, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.

Originally a member of the French Communist Party and the Communist International, he moved to the fascist French Popular Party. After an imprisonment for collaboration, he supported far-right causes such as the European Social Movement, the \\"ultras\\" side in the Algerian War, the 1965 presidential campaign of Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, and the Front national. Biography Barth√©lemy was born in Ajaccio. His father was a socialist. During his studies at the University of Aix-en-Provence, Barth√©lemy supported Action Fran√ßaise. He moved to Marseilles and joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1925. Following the national congress of the PCF in Lille in 1926, delegates appointed him to membership in Secours Rouge International. After an internship in the USSR in 1928, he worked for the Communist International under the command of Palmiro Togliatti. He carried out missions to Spain and Italy. Barth√©lemy distanced himself from the PCF in 1930, but did not join the French Popular Party (PPF) of Jacques Doriot until 28 June 1936. Disillusioned with Communism, he was attracted to the \\"revolutionary authenticity\\" of fascism and National Socialism. In October 1936 he was appointed to the position of the Federal secretary of the party for the Alpes-Maritimes, centered in Nice. He subsequently joined its central committee and its political bureau. In November 1939, he became secretary-general of the party and was installed in Paris. He was a contributor to L'√âmancipation nationale ([The National Emancipation]), and Le Cri du peuple. When the PPF Congress met in Villeurbanne in July 1941 he was appointed secretary general of both zones. He participated in the creation of the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, of which he was member of the Central Committee. On 6 August 1944, Barth√©lemy fled Paris ahead of the Allies' advance. He then took refuge in the Sigmaringen enclave. In November 1944, he was chosen to represent the PPF to the Italian Social Republic. After Doriot's death in February 1945, Barth√©lemy, Simon Sabiani, and Marcel Marschall formed a triumvirate to head the PPF. Barth√©lemy moved to Milan, Italy in April 1945. Arrested on 2 May, he was handed over to French authorities, tried by a military tribunal, and sentenced to several years in prison. Post-war After his release, Barth√©lemy joined the European Social Movement of Maurice Bard√®che in 1951. He was on the board of Bard√®che's journal D√©fense de l'Occident (\\"Defense of the West\\"). Barth√©lemy was a member of the Front national pour l'Alg√©rie fran√ßaise (FNAF, National Front for French Algeria); founded in Paris in June 1960 and dissolved by Charles de Gaulle after an \\"ultra\\" rebellion in December 1960. He supported the Secours populaire pour l'entraide et la solidarit√© (1960‚Äì1964), whose purpose was to aid OAS prisoners of French Algeria. Barth√©lemy became part of the committee to support Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour in the December 1965 presidential election. Barth√©lemy participated in the creation of the National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen in 1972 and was its administrative secretary from 1974 to May 1978. In 1978, his memoir, Du communisme au fascisme, histoire d'un engagement politique ([From Communism to Fascism: A History of Political Commitment]), was published by √âditions Albin Michel. Philip Rees described it as \\"perhaps the most interesting and revealing of all the accounts of political conversion from extreme left to extreme right and a vital source book for the history of the PPF.\\" He retired to the south of France.

In 1799 she was renamed Suworow, and under that name she captured numerous prizes before she was paid off after the Treaty of Amiens. Service as Black Joke In May 1795, the \\"lugger\\" Black Joke, under the command of Lieutenant Richard Clark, was part of Sir Sidney Smith's squadron in the Channel.Smith (1848), Vol. 1, p.162. On 24 February 1796, His Majesty's cutter Black Joke captured Poor Jack. In 1796, the armed lugger Black Joke, under the command of Lieutenant Boarder, protected the Hull whaling fleet sailing to Lerwick.Lubbock (1937), p.141. By some accounts, in 1797 Black Joke alerted the Fleet to the Dutch entry into the North Sea before the Battle of Camperdown. The majority of accounts attribute the warning to the hired cutter Active. Also in 1797, the lugger Black Joke recaptured Ceres and Good Intent. Black Joke was in company with the hired armed vessel Liberty and the Excise cutter Lively at the time of the recapture of Ceres, and Liberty at the time of the recapture of Good Intent. On 10 March 1798 His Majesty's hired armed lugger Black Joke was briefly under the command of Lieutenant Mauritius Adolphus Newton de Stark when she captured the fishing vessel Saint Petre. On 26 May Black Joke and the sloop Hound captured the brig Minerva. On 27 April 1799, while under the command of Lieutenant James Nicolson (or Nichelson), Black Joke captured the French chasse-mar√©e Rebecca, of four swivel guns and seven men, just out of Brest having on board a capitaine de fr√©gate with dispatches for Ireland. The dispatches were a ruse that drew British attention to the Irish coast, when the Brest fleet had sailed to reinforce French forces in Corfu, Malta, and Egypt (see: Bruix' expedition of 1799).James (1837), Vol. 2, p.256.Roche, vol.1, p.327 Then on 10 July Black Joke captured Flora. Flora, of Dublin, had been sailing with a cargo of wine, fruit, and cotton, when the French privateer Vengeance, of 20 guns and 130 men, had captured her. Black Joke sent Flora into Torbay.Lloyd's List, 16 July 1799 - accessed 10 November 2013. Service as Suworow By 2 November 1799 she was sailing under the name Suworow.Alternatively Suwarrow, Soworrow or Zuwarrow, presumably after Alexander Suvorov, who won a series of victories against the French during 1799 Under Lieutenant James Nicholson she carried despatches to and from Lord Bridport, commander of the Channel Fleet, off Brest,Naval Chronicle (1799), p.639. and captured numerous prizes. On 27 November the French privateer rowboat Revanche arrived at Portsmouth, sent in by the schooner Suwarrow.Lloyd's Marine List,, #4017 - accessed 1 December 2013. On 1 and 14 March, and 19 April and 10 June 1800, she captured the ketch Jean Bart, the chasse marees Bon Citojan and Morbihan, and the ketch Clair Voyante. To capture the chase marees, Nicholson had had to drive off three French luggers, one of 10 guns and two of eight, in the Passage du Raz. Actually, Nicholson captured three chase marees, one in ballast and two carrying wine, and he sent all three into Falmouth or Plymouth.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.237. On 5 March Suworow shared in the capture, with and , of the brig Sophie. On 5 April Suworow chased a French privateer of 16 guns for several hours but lost her in the night.Naval Chronicle, 1799, p.327. Then on 12 May, together with the frigates and , she captured another chasse maree. Also during May Nicholson reconnoitered Belle √éle. He took an officer from into Rochefort where they counted five sail-of-the-line and three frigates ready for sea. When Nicholson returned to Belle √éle in August he found that the French had fortified every point of land or creek that he had found unfortified in May.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.249. On 12 September 1800 Nicholson cut out the French brig Providence from under two batteries near Camaret Point. She was carrying wine, soap and brandy for the Brest fleet; the capture took place under heavy fire but Suworow suffered no casualties. Although the third rate and the frigate were in sight, they voluntarily relinquished their share of the prize money to Nicholson and his crew \\"in testimony of their approbation of their conduct.\\"The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.251-2. On 23 November 1800 Captain Sir Richard Strachan in chased a French convoy in to the Morbihan. There shore batteries and the 20-gun corvette R√©olaise were able to provide protection. harried the corvette until she ran onshore at Port Navale; her crew got her off again later.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.58. Suworow then towed in four boats with Lieutenant Hennah of Captain and a cutting-out party. The hired armed cutters Nile and Lurcher towed in four more boats from Magicienne. Although the cutting-out party was exposed to heavy fire cannon and small arms fire, it reached the corvette. The party set fire to the corvette before withdrawing; shortly thereafter the corvette blew up. The boats also brought out two merchant vessels that their captors later burnt. Only one British seaman, a crewman from Suworow, was killed in the attack; seven seamen were wounded.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp.507-8. However, Suworows sails and rigging were so badly cut up that Captain had to tow her.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.529. Suworow sailed on 21 December 1800 to cruise off the Penmarks as part of Sir Edward Pellew's squadron.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.523. On 3 February 1801 she captured the French brig Jeune Annette (or Jeune Nannette). Jeune Annette, under Lieutenant de vaisseaux Feuqueux, was armed with 18 guns and had a crew of 45 men. She had been sailing from Cayenne to Bordeaux with a cargo of \\"anatto, dye wood, elephants teeth, etc.\\" and a number of deported priests, who were emaciated after their confinement. Because Suworow had previously sent in four Danish vessels, Suwarrow had only 16 men and boys on board when she chased and captured Jeune Annette.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.111 Jeune Annette became the hired armed brig (or cutter) Sir Thomas Pasley. On 23 June, while Suworow was off Santander with dispatches from Admiral William Cornwallis when she encountered a Spanish 44-gun frigate and a gun- brig. The Spaniards chased her for 14 hours and were gaining on her so Nicholson had to throw all his guns overboard to gain speed. He succeeded in escaping only when darkness arrived. Suworow then came into Plymouth for a refit.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.82. In early October Suworow sailed into Brest under a flag of truce, bringing with her a senior officer. Nicholson ended up having dinner with Admiral Villaret, the commander of the French fleet, and the Spanish Admiral, Don Gravina. Madame Villaret presented Lieutenant Nicholson with a Morocco purse, having a bust of Bonaparte under glass, set in silver. Admiral Villaret sent a basket of fruit to Admiral Cornwallis as well.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.344. Fate After the signing of the Treaty of Amiens brought peace with France, the Admiralty terminated Suworows contract on 28 October, as it did the contracts of the other hired vessels. The hired vessels turned in their guns and stores prior to being paid off.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.428. Prize money from Jean Bart, Bon Citojan, Morbiham, Clair Voyante, and Jeune Annette was paid on 22 March 1802. One report has Black Joke (under that name and not Suworow) being accidentally burnt in Sutton Pool, Plymouth, on 28 January 1802.Gossett (1986), pp. 35-6. She was discovered to be on fire amongst a tier of ships and after she had burned with great fury she was scuttled. She sank without doing any harm. However, another report suggests that she may have reverted to her old name and served as the hired armed lugger Black Joke from 1808 until her capture by the French in 1810.Cockerell (1903), p.2.

According to Oxford DictionariesOxford Dictionaries (2014). Relaxation, http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/relaxation?q=relaxation+ relaxation is when the body and mind are free from tension and anxiety. Relaxation is a form of mild ecstasy coming from the frontal lobe of the brain in which the backward cortex sends signals to the frontal cortex via a mild sedative. Relaxation can be achieved through meditation, autogenics, and progressive muscle relaxation. Relaxation helps improve coping with stress. Stress is the leading cause of mental problems and physical problems,Physical health and mental health, https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/p/physical- health-and-mental-health therefore feeling relaxed is beneficial for a person's health. When we are stressed, the sympathetic nervous system is activated because we are in a fight-or-flight response mode; over time, this could have negative effects on a human body.  History  The idea of relaxation in psychology was popularized by Dr. Edmund Jacobson in his published book Progressive Relaxation. It was a technical book intended for doctors and scientists. His book describes tensing and relaxing specific muscles at a time to achieve overall relaxation in the body. Jacobson then published another book called You Must Relax published in 1934 that was geared towards the general public. According to Jacobson, his research started in 1908 at Harvard University, and later moving on to Cornell and University of Chicago. His research was aimed at improving the general human well being. In 1932, Johannes Schultz and Wolfgang Luthe developed a method of relaxation that emphasized using the power of suggestion, called autogenic training. In 1975, Herbert Benson and Mirium Z. Klipper published a book called The Relaxation Response, which gives instructions on tying meditation techniques into daily activities the average person could do.  Relaxation techniques  Although stress levels vary across society, the fact remains that stress can be detrimental to one's health. In order to combat this stress, there have been a variety of methods developed that have been proven to reduce stress and its consequences in everyday life. The majority of techniques can be classified in to either Physical, Mental or Therapeutic techniques.  Physical relaxation technique  Breathing techniques are one of the easiest ways to reduce stress. They require little effort and can be done anywhere at any time. Proper breathing techniques that incorporate deep abdominal breathing have been shown to reduce the physical symptoms of depression, anxiety and hypertension as well as everyday emotional symptoms of anger and nervousness. Progressive muscle relaxation is a relaxation technique that requires an individual to focus on flexing and holding a certain set of muscles and then slowly relaxing those same muscles. As the individual flexes and releases those muscles from top to bottom they will feel a deep sense of relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is a somewhat adapted version of the Jacobsonian Relaxation Technique developed in the 1920s. Progressive muscle relaxation is currently used in clinical and non-clinical settings to reduce the effects of anxiety and sleeplessness brought upon by stress. The long-term goal of this relaxation technique is to be able to identify when your body's muscles are suffering the effects of stress and to be able to relax the individual and the individuals muscles when directed.  Mental technique  Meditation has long been practiced in other regions around the world. However, it is a practice that is fairly new to North America and it is gaining attention quickly for the physical and psychological benefits it provides to your body. Studies have shown that in addition to reducing physiological and psychological stresses placed on your body, individuals who practice meditation have much fewer doctor visits for both physical and psychological illnesses. Hypnosis relaxation therapy has recently become another technique used among healthcare professionals to promote relaxation. When performed correctly, hypnosis has the ability to put an individual into a deep state of relaxation. During this state, the individual is highly vulnerable to suggestions stated by the person performing the hypnosis. Not only will the hypnotized individual be stress free and in a deep state of relaxation but it is thought that when the individual is out of hypnosis they will be less susceptible to the effects of stress as suggested by the person who performed the hypnosis on them. In addition to relaxation, hypnosis therapy is being used to treat a variety of conditions. Treatments for conditions using hypnosis that are currently being promoted by The Mayo Clinic are; smoking addiction therapy, pain control therapy, weight loss, coping with chemotherapy, asthma, and allergy relief.  Therapeutic relaxation  Relaxation techniques used in therapy by a certified counselor or therapist could include any of the previous techniques discussed. Professionals in the fields of psychology or counseling will have the ability to administer a variety of these techniques. If they feel it is appropriate they may prescribe medication to assist the patient with relaxation. Although a number of these techniques are simple and can be performed on one's own time, patients may receive better results if they are guided by a professional who is very familiar with the techniques. Meditation Herbert Benson, a professor at the medical school at Harvard University, has proposed in his book The Relaxation Response a mechanism of the body that counters the fight-or-flight response. The relaxation response reduces the body‚Äôs metabolism, heart and breathing rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and calms brain activity. It increases the immune response, helps attention and decision making, and changes gene activities that are the opposite of those associated stress. The relaxation response is achieved through meditation. Benson's meditation technique involves these four steps: # A quiet environment to help focus # A mental device to help keep attention constant (a sound or word said repeatedly) # A positive attitude to avoid getting upset over failed attempts # A comfortable position Autogenics Autogenics was invented by Dr. Johannes Heinrich Schultz in the 1920s. The process of autogenics is by relaxing muscles deeply, and by doing so, the mind follows through and relaxes as well. There as six parts to autogenics training: # Heaviness in parts of the body (arms and legs feel heavy) # Warmth in parts of the body (arms and legs feel warm) # Heartbeat (heart is calm) # Breathing (breathing is calm) # Warmth in the abdominal area # Forehead is cool Progressive muscle relaxation Progressive muscle relaxation helps relax your muscles by tensing certain parts of the body (such as the neck), and then releasing the tension in order to feel the muscles relaxing. This technique helps for people with anxiety because they are always tense throughout the day.  Benefits  The benefits of relaxation can be found in three main areas of an individual‚Äôs health, including; mental, physical and physiological health. Being relaxed can do positive things for someone‚Äôs health from just elevating your mood to helping with insomnia. All of these things can help an individual live a happier and healthier life and may increase the longevity of one's life. There are not many draw backs of relaxation. It is an easy technique to understand and follow through with. Three categories that relaxation can help with are mental, physical, and physiological.  Mental  Mental health is very important and needs to be worked on every day. Relaxation can help with many impairments that can occur in one's mental health. There is a higher mood and lower anxiety in those who practice relaxation techniques. Those who are relaxed have much slower and clearer thought processes than those who are not relaxed; this can be shown on an EEG. It is well known that relaxation can help reduce stress. With reducing stress, a person can help reduce the negative things that stress can do to the body. Coping mechanisms are also improved with relaxation techniques in both mental and physical pain. Sleep disorders are an area that can produce stress and mental health issues. Relaxation may help reduce insomnia in those who have sleeping disorders. Those with insomnia may even give up sleeping aids just by practicing relaxation techniques. Being off of unnecessary medication or sleep aids will help health as an over all. Even though relaxation cannot get rid of chronic diseases, it may help dull of the symptoms one may have. Many cancer and AIDS patients are taught relaxation techniques.  Physical  Physical health is also something that needs to be worked on daily, whether it is exercise, healthy eating, or relaxation. states that blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate will all decrease when one is relaxed. This means that a person's heart does not beat as fast and their breathing is shallow, helping one's body have time to rest. This will reduce the extra stress that these things can do to the body if they are over worked. Muscle tension will decrease. If one's muscle tension is decreased they are not burning up extra energy that they may need later in the day. Metabolism can also decrease; this is mostly seen in hibernation and sleep and that gives the body extra time to rest and focus on other aspect that it needs to. This could be seen as a good or bad thing, depending on the overall quality of health. People who practice relaxation have said to be able to tolerate pain better both mentally and physically.  Physiological  In regards to the nervous system, relaxation can also play a big role. An individual will go from active and alert, which is the sympathetic, to parasympathetic which is rest and digest. When they are relaxing, it gives the body time to catch up. A person does not need to worry about running, because they are sitting still and allowing ‚Äúrest and digest‚Äù. Immune systems will increase with increased relaxation which is why relaxation can be seen as part of treatment for AIDS and cancer patients.

It was designed prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, two prototypes were nearing completion when Germany invaded France in 1940, with one being flown after the end of the war as an experimental platform. Development and design In December 1936 the French Air Ministry issued a specification for a four-seat, twin-engined medium bomber, with Br√©guet's initial design, the Br√©guet 480 (or Bre. 480) to be powered with the specified 1,225 hp (914 kW) Gnome et Rh√¥ne 14L radial engines, intended to carry 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of bombs over a 2,500 km (1,600 mi) radius. Gnome et Rh√¥ne abandoned the 14L however, so, after considering a version powered by two Hispano-Suiza 12Y V12 engines, Br√©guet reworked the design as the Br√©guet 482, with four 1,350 hp (1007 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Z engines, with an order for two prototypes placed by the French Air Ministry on 12 May 1938.Green 1967, pp. 129, 131. The Br√©guet 482 was a mid-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, with a clean, low-drag, oval section monocoque fuselage, twin tails and a retractable tailwheel undercarriage. The planned defensive armament was a 20mm Hispano- Suiza HS.404 cannon in a power-operated dorsal position, with a 7.5mm machine gun in the nose and a further two machine guns in ventral mountings. Up to 2,500 kg (5,500 lb) of bombs could be carried. Operational history Construction of the two prototypes was well progressed when Germany invaded France on 10 May 1940, and in late May it was decided to evacuate the near complete prototypes from Villacoublay near Paris, with the first prototype being sent to B√¥ne in Algeria and the second to the Br√©guet factory at Anglet, near Bayonne in the far south-west of France. The first prototype was destroyed during a German air raid following the Allied invasion of French North Africa, but the second prototype remained untouched, despite the fact that Anglet had been occupied by the Germans since 1940. When the Germans withdrew, Br√©guet resumed work on the Br 482, proposing to complete it with more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Z engines and a heavier armament. The French Arm√©e de l'Air had no requirement for a bomber, however, and it was decided to use the aircraft, with the planned modifications, but with armament removed, as a research aircraft. In this form it was finally flown for the first time in November 1947, being used for various experimental purposes, including testing of the 12Z engines.

She was well known in French society as an artist and sculptor, and was married to Christian de Villeneuve-Esclapon. Biography=Early life Jeanne was born on 15 September 1861 in Orval Abbey in Belgium. She was one of five children born to her parents, although she only had one sibling that survived to adulthood: Roland Bonaparte. Though born during the reign of Napoleon III of France, her family was never well received at the French imperial court. He was very intelligent and well- educated; in his youth, he did much traveling. Upon his return from fighting in Spain, he devoted himself to the study of literature and history; his writings were much admired by critics. One observer commented at their wedding: > Jeanne Bonaparte advanced up the nave leaning on the arm of her brother... > She has little of her mother's striking beauty, although she resembles her a > good deal, but she is tall, distinguished looking, and has a wealth of raven > tresses... Jeanne and Christian had six children. Later life Jeanne had a Paris salon that was frequented by illustrious writers and painters, as well as the cream of American society. Her husband was, apart from politics, mostly interested in occultism. George Greville Moore, an English officer, was a contemporary of Jeanne's. He wrote that she: > used to make a great display of toilette at certain balls. She was > remarkable for her beauty, which was more of the Oriental style; she was > very dark and had a sallow complexion, but beautiful black eyes and long > eyelashes. I remember one evening every one crowding around the staircase to > see her arrive at a ball. On that occasion she wore a white dress trimmed > with water-lilies, with a tremendously long train, and no jewelry > whatsoever. She rarely, if ever, danced; her long train scarcely allowed it. On 21 November 1907, Jeanne served as a witness for the marriage of her niece Princess Marie Bonaparte to Prince George of Greece and Denmark. Jeanne died on 25 July 1910 in Paris, at the age of 48.

He backed the military coup against Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.BBC News (4 July 2013): \\"Q&A;: Egypt military ousts Morsi\\" BBC News Service  Apostasy  In 2016 al-Tayeb, said that leaving Islam (apostasy) is punishable by death. In his view, crimes, assault and treason are forms of apostasy and must be punished. Apostates must rejoin Islam or be killed. Opposition to sectarianism He has strongly rebuked the Salafi anti-Alawite preaching, which has increased since the Syrian government, cracked down on the Sunni Islamist rebels in the Syrian Civil War. Jews In an interview which aired on Egypt's Channel 1 on 25 October 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), al-Tayeb stated, \\"Since the inception of Islam 1,400 years ago, we have been suffering from Jewish and Zionist interference in Muslim affairs.

He also claimed that Jews consider non-Jews to be \\"extremely inferior\\" and that Jews \\"practice a terrible hierarchy, and they are not ashamed to admit it, because it is written in the Torah ‚Äì with regard to killing, enslavement, and so on\\".Leading center of Sunni learning criticizes but does not accuse Islamic State of apostasy by Ariel Ben Solomon, The Jerusalem Post, 14 December 2014.

He has been criticized for not expressly stating that Islamic State was heretical.Al Ahram: \\"In search of ‚Äòrenewal‚Äô - Al-Azhar is at the centre of an escalating controversy\\" by Amany Maged 15 January 2015Al Monitor: \\"Al-Azhar refuses to consider the Islamic State an apostate\\" by Ahmed Fouad \\"The sheikh of Al-Azhar, Ahmed al-Tayeb, repeated his rejection of declaring IS apostates on 1 Jan, during a meeting with editors- in-chief of Egyptian newspapers. This sparked criticism from a number of religious, political and media parties, especially since Al-Azhar could have renounced the Nigerian mufti‚Äôs statement on IS without addressing the issue of whether or not Al-Azhar considers the group apostates\\" The Ash'ari school of Islamic theology - to which El-Tayeb belongs - does not allow calling a person who follows the shahada an apostate. Al-Tayeb has strongly come out against the practice of takfirism, declaring a Muslim an apostate, which is used by Islamic State to \\"judge and accuse anyone who doesn't toe their line with apostasy and outside the realm of the faith\\" and declares \\"jihad on peaceful Muslims\\" by using \\"flawed interpretations of some Qur'anic texts, the prophet's Sunna, and the Imams' views, believing incorrectly that they are leaders of Muslim armies fighting infidel peoples in unbelieving lands\\".Muslim World League: \\"Sheikh Al-Azhar Speech in opening of conference\\" 22 February 2015 Wahhabism and Salafism In late 2016, at a conference of over a hundred Sunni scholars in Chechnya, al-Tayeb defined orthodox Sunnism as \\"the Ash'arites and Maturidites (adherents of the theological systems of Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi and Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash'ari) ... followers of any of the four schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki or Hanbali) and ... also the followers of the Sufism of Imam Junaid al-Baghdadi in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification.\\"\\"Islamic conference in Chechnya: Why Sunnis are disassociating themselves from Salafists\\" Sep, 09 2016  He stated: ‚ÄúAhluls Sunna wal Jama‚Äôah are the Ash‚Äôarites or Muturidis (adherents of Abu Mansur al- Maturidi's systematic theology which is also identical to Imam Abu Hasan al- Ash'ari‚Äôs school of logical thought). In matters of belief, they are followers of any of the four schools of thought (Hanafi, Shaf‚Äôai, Maliki or Hanbali) and are also the followers of pure Sufism in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification. Having said that, Sheikh Ahmad al-Tayeb excluded the ‚ÄúSalafis‚Äù from the term of Ahluls Sunna (Sunnis) stating that Salafis ‚Äì also known as Wahhabis ‚Äì are not from among the Sunnis.Ibid., \\"Islamic conference in Chechnya: Why Sunnis are disassociating themselves from Salafis\\" The conference was believed to have been designed to take an \\"uncompromising stand against the growing Takfiri terrorism that is playing havoc across the world.\\"\\"Islamic conference in Chechnya: Why Sunnis are disassociating themselves from Salafists\\" Sep, 09 2016 Shia Islam In 2016, he reissued the fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam. Christians In February 2017, he commented on the issue of building a church for 500 Christian Copts in Kom Al Lofi, Minya Governorate, by saying: \\"their numbers do not allow for the construction of a church.\\", then he added, \\"We are a Muslim state (Dawla muslimah) and if there was a pre-existing church we would not object to prayers taking place, but why call for having a church now when we need to unite, not cause the occurrence of strife and this is strife caused by the media!\\" On 7 November 2017, he met Pope Francis in the Vatican, to discuss spreading the culture of peace and coexistence and renouncing extremism and Islamophobia. In February 2019, they met again in Abu Dhabi during the Pope's visit to the United Arab Emirates, where he also signed the Document on Human Fraternity. On 15 November 2019, they met again in the Vatican, to achieve the goals of the signed document.

Other examples of CCPDMA are found in classical pathology textbooks as techniques of cutting surgical specimens to allow the examination of the inferior and lateral margins of typically elliptical surgical specimens.  Comparison to alternatives  CCPDMA is superior to standard bread loafing due to very low false negative error rate. Bread loafing extrapolates the margin exam of a few representative slides to the entire surgical margin. CCPDMA allows for the complete examination of the surgical margin without statistical extrapolation and assumptions. The first advantage of CCPDMA method is that it allows for the complete examination of the entire surgical margin of the specimen. The second advantage of CCPDMA is allowing the surgeon to remove only a very small surgical margin. As the CCPDMA surgery is frequently performed using frozen section pathology, immediate reporting of positive surgical margin is made, and the tumor can be completely removed in the same day. Traditional pathology processing is called \\"bread loafing\\", and only allows for the partial examination of the surgical margin. Some surgeons send the specimen out for processing, and the result of the surgical margin assessment may not be made until days later.Kimyai-Asadi A, et al.

CCPDMA is subject to the basic principles of histology sectioning. From a physical standpoint, the true margin is never assessed because a thin face margin has to be cut through in order to make the slide for examination. Therefore, a true and complete assessment of all margins is never achieved. Serial sectioning allows CCPDMA approaches near-complete evaluation of the surgical margin and may be performed by pathologists, dermatologists, and surgeons.

Jarre got into conflict with the new communist rulers of China early on. He opposed the formation of state-sanctioned Christian churches in China (Three-Self Patriotic Movement) and supported the Legion of Mary, an association of Catholic laity that was viewed as reactionary organization by the communists. As a consequence, Jarre was arrested by the Chinese authorities on July 25, 1951 and from October 17, 1951 onwards he was imprisoned in Jinan. Jarre was subjected to conditions of poor sanitation, nutrition, isolation, repeated interrogation, as well as other forms of abuse. He died on March 8, 1952 in the St. Josephs Hospital of Jinan. Members of his diocese buried Jarre's body wrapped in the red clothes of a martyr, but the authorities exhumed his body with the intent to rebury him in a black prisoner's uniform.

The , gauge network is electrified at 3 kV (3,000 V) DC. The headquarters of the Azerbaijan Railways is in the capital Baku. Azerbaijan Railways is a successor of Soviet Railways, which itself was the successor of Russian Imperial Railways. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 its railway system broke up into national railway systems of various former Soviet republics from which the independent Republic of Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijan Railways both emerged in that year. The first railway line in Azerbaijan was laid in 1878 and was opened in 1880 in the suburbs outside Baku. There are of rail tracks out of which 72% or are single track and 28% or are double tracks. Of the total exploitation length of route 43% or are electrified. About 38% of the length of the railway routes or are equipped with full automatic blocks and 16% or are equipped with centralized dispatchers.

With the Kars‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìBaku railway, a regional rail link project that will directly connect Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan, the railway lines are being modernised in Azerbaijan with the latest technology and brand new fast rail stock is being added and will replace the old rail stock which are still in service. The total length of the Azerbaijan Railways ranks 57 in country comparison to the world.  History  Baku Railway Station  Russian Imperial Railways 1878-1917  The first railway line in Azerbaijan then belonging to the Russian Empire was laid in 1878 and was opened in 1880 within the suburban range of Baku, which led from Sabun√ßu to Suraxanƒ±, today situated within the city of Baku. The track width corresponded to the Russian gauge. The first long-distance railway line was opened in 1883, which led from Baku to Tbilisi in Georgia. In 1900 railway lines were opened which connected Baku via Bil…ôc…ôri with Derbent and Petrovsk (Makhachkala) in Dagestan and thus connected Azerbaijan with the rest of the Russian Empire (and later the Soviet Union). In 1908 with extension of the railway line from Ararat in Armenia to ≈û…ôrur and Julfa in the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan, this part of Azerbaijan was connected with Armenia. Thus the development of the Azerbaijani Railway was for the time being considered final.  Soviet Railways 1917-1991  2TE10M locomotive built during the soviet era, which is still in service as of January 2020 After the collapse of the Russian Empire and the Russian Revolution the country was transformed into the Soviet Union and the Russian Imperial Railways into the Soviet Railways. Due to the availability of electricity from the vast water power sources of Azerbaijan, the very early electrification of the railway lines of Azerbaijan began. In 1926 with the electrification with 1,2 kV (1,200 V) direct current of the railway line between Baku and Sabun√ßu, it became the first electrically operated railway line of the Soviet Union. Later electrifications took place with 3 kV (3,000 V) direct current. In 1924 the railway line was extended southwards to ∆èl…ôt and Neft√ßala. In 1941 the railway line was extended from Horadiz and Mincivan through Armenia including a railway line extension to Kapan, to Julfa in the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan. Thus the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan was finally connected with Azerbaijan proper. In 1941 the railway line was also extended southwards to Astara, Azerbaijan at the southern border with Iran. In 1944 the railway line was extended to K…ôt…ôlparaq, Aƒüdam and Stepanakert (Xank…ôndi). Until 1991 the railway traffic was operated in Azerbaijan by the Soviet Railway under supervision of the Soviet Traffic Ministry. The Azerbaijani branch of the Soviet Railways was divided into three departments of Baku, G…ônc…ô and Nakhchivan City.

Due to the conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan, the railway service in the Armenian occupied areas of Azerbaijan including Nagorno-Karabakh as well as international railway traffic to Armenia has been cut. As a result, 240.4 km of Azerbaijani railway is under Armenian occupation. Thus also no railway traffic exists to the Azerbaijani exclave Nakhchivan which is divided from the rest of Azerbaijan by Armenia, but is not under Armenian occupation. The railway traffic into Iran which is only via Nakhchivan is likewise cut. Due to this, international railway traffic between Azerbaijan and Iran is continuing only with Nakhchivan. International railway traffic also exists with the Russian Railways and the Georgian Railway and is scheduled with the Turkish State Railways via Georgia from 2017 onwards. In freight traffic, the exportation of oil from the oil wells from Baku at the Caspian Sea to the Georgian port of Batumi at the Black Sea forms an important share of the rail transport in Azerbaijan: The freight market share of the Azerbaijan State Railway was 21% in 1999. In 2009 the closed joint-stock company \\"Azerbaijan Railways\\" (Az”ôrbaycan D”ômir Yollarƒ± Qapalƒ± S…ôhmdar C…ômiyy…ôti, \\"ADY\\" QSC) - the national operator of the railway network in Azerbaijan with 100% state capital ‚Äì was founded on the basis of the Azerbaijan State Railways, functionally replacing it. The Kars‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìBaku railway is a regional railway project to directly connect Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The project was scheduled for completion in 2017. Although no additional railway lines will be added in Azerbaijan itself, as this section in Azerbaijan is already double track and electrified, the railway lines will be modernised with the latest technology and brand new and fast rail stock will be added and will replace the old rail stock which are still in service. The freight market share of the railways are also expected to rise rapidly with completion of the Kars‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìBaku railway. Stadler is to supply double- deck EMUs to Azerbaijan. An agreement for the supply of five Kiss double-deck electric multiple-units was signed by Stadler Rail CEO Peter Spuhler and Javid Gurbanov, Chairman of national railway ADY, at the TransCaspian 2015 trade fair in Baku on May 13.

Introduced as a private member's bill by David Rowe-Beddoe, Baron Rowe-Beddoe and sponsored by Alun Michael MP, it received royal assent on 18 March 2010. It created the Church in Wales' counterpart to mirror the Church of England Marriage Measure 2008 No. 1 and brought the Church in Wales' marriage regulations into line with those of the Church of England.  Background  The Church in Wales had been disestablished from the Church of England since 1921 following the Welsh Church Act 1914. It had the effect of severing the Church in Wales' links with canon law of the established Church of England. This meant that any Measures passed by the Church of England did not have legal force over the Church in Wales. Any changes made to the Church in Wales' legal situations must be made via an Act of Parliament as the National Assembly for Wales has no jurisdiction over ecclesiastic law or marriage law as they are reserved matters. Prior to the Act, when two people wished to marry in Wales ordinarily, at least one of them would have to live in the parish where they would get married or have attended the parish church for the previous six months. The Act allowed couples to use residency of parents or grandparents or their parents regular attendance in the specific Church as a valid condition to be married in that parish.  History  Coat of arms of the Church in Wales In 2008 the General Synod of the Church of England passed the Church of England Marriage Measure 2008 which extended the rights of marriage within their churches to allowing people to marry in churches where they had been christened or confirmed as well as in churches that their parents and grandparents had been married in. This led to the Church in Wales being anomalous with the Church of England as the Measure only applied to the Church of England. This meant that the Church in Wales continued to use the old requirements of either residency in the parish or regular church attendance for the previous six months. As the Church in Wales Governing Body's actions have no legal force in English law, legislation from Parliament was required to bring the Church in Wales into line with the Church of England. In 2009, the Governing Body debated and accepted Private Members' Motion (No 09/13) which requested that the Church in Wales take steps to bring the church's marriage regulations into line with those of the Church of England. The Marriage (Wales) Bill was drafted by the Governing Body of the Church in Wales and brought forward into Parliament as a private member's bill in the House of Lords by the chairman of the Representative Body of the Church in Wales, Lord Rowe-Beddoe. The text was drafted by the Church in Wales' Governing Body. It passed through the House of Lords without amendment. In the House of Commons, the bill was sponsored by the Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament, Alun Michael. The act received Royal Assent from Queen Elizabeth II on 18 March 2010, before the dissolution of Parliament. The Marriage (Wales) Act 2010 was viewed by academics as being an example of a disestablished church enjoying the privileges of establishment but without the legal ability to self-regulate itself and requiring primary legislation to make desired changes.

Garfield Memorial is a memorial dedicated to assassinated President James A. Garfield and located in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. The memorial, built from is a combination of Byzantine, Gothic, and Romanesque Revival styles, began construction in October 1885 and was dedicated on May 30, 1890. Garfield; his wife, former First Lady Lucretia Garfield; and two other members of the Garfield family are entombed in the crypt level of the monument. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Site selection President James A. Garfield, a resident of nearby Mentor, Ohio, was shot in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. He died on September 19, 1881. Garfield himself had expressed the wish to be buried at Lake View Cemetery, and the cemetery offered a burial site free of charge to his widow, Lucretia Garfield. Mrs. Garfield agreed to bury her husband at Lake View.; Even before Garfield's funeral, plans were laid by his friends and admirers for a grand tomb to be erected at a high point in the cemetery. The Garfield Memorial Committee selected the highest point in the cemetery in June 1883 for the president's final resting place. Lake View Cemetery built a road around the memorial in early 1885, and began work on cutting a road from the Euclid Gate to the memorial site later that fall. The cemetery also began work on making improvements to the landscape, water, and drainage around the site. Design and construction The tomb was designed by architect George Keller in the Byzantine, Gothic, and Romanesque Revival styles. All the stone for the monument came from the quarries of the Cleveland Stone Company, and was quarried locally. The exterior reliefs, which depict scenes from Garfield's life, were done by Caspar Buberl. Its cost, $135,000 ($ in dollars), was funded entirely through private donations. Part of the memorial's funding came from pennies sent in by children throughout the country. The round tower is in diameter and high. Around the exterior of the balcony are five terra cotta panels with over 110 life size figures depicting Garfield's life and death. The interior features stained glass windows and window like panes representing the original 13 colonies, plus the state of Ohio, along with panels depicting War and Peace; mosaics; deep red granite columns; and a -tall white Carrara marble statue of President Garfield by Alexander Doyle. An observation deck provides views of downtown Cleveland and Lake Erie. Construction on the memorial began on October 6, 1885, and it was dedicated on May 30, 1890. The caskets of the President and Lucretia Garfield lie in a crypt beneath the memorial, along with the ashes of their daughter (Mary \\"Mollie\\" Garfield Stanley-Brown [1867‚Äì1947]) and son-in-law, and Joseph Stanley Brown. Lucretia Garfield died on March 13, 1918, and was interred in the Garfield Memorial on March 21. Operational history Since the Garfield Memorial was private, the committee overseeing its operation charged an entry fee of 10 cents per person to defray its maintenance costs. In late October 1923, the Garfield National Monument Association turned the Garfield Memorial over to Lake View Cemetery. Most of the Monument Association's members had died, and its charter did not permit for a self-perpetuating board. After accepting title to the memorial and its land, Lake View Cemetery immediately ended the practice of charging a 10 cent ($ in dollars) admission fee to the memorial. Lake View also began cleaning, repairing, and rehabilitating the memorial. Lake View Cemetery spent $5 million in 2016 and 2017 conserving, repairing, and upgrading the memorial's structural elements. This included reinforcing beams and columns in the basement. In 2019, the cemetery began a multi-million-dollar project to clean the exterior and repoint any damaged or missing mortar. It is the first time in the memorial's history that the exterior has been cleaned. The memorial closes every winter on November 19 (President Garfield's birthday) and reopens in April.

Founded in the early 1890s, the parish completed the present Baroque-styled church shortly before 1910; the building has been named a historic site. By the early 1890s, a strong Italian immigrant community had been formed along Mayfield Road on the eastern edge of Cleveland, and priests from the nearby community of East Cleveland began ministering to these immigrants. Their efforts saw success: the Diocese of Cleveland formed Holy Rosary parish in 1892, and the first church building was erected by the year's end. Although Italian ties were strong in the community, they soon began to assimilate; religious education for children was offered at the church as early as 1896. At one time, Holy Rosary was one of approximately fifty national parishes in Cleveland, due to the city's rapid growth via European immigration; it was the first Italian parish in the city. The members arranged for the present building to be erected in 1905, although four years passed before it was ready for consecration.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 234. Many of Holy Rosary's earliest members were stone cutters, but their church does not reflect their craft: its walls are brick. The foundation is stone, and copper and stone are used for various external details. At the center of the facade, flights of stairs provide access to the double doors at the main entrance, above which two large arched windows are placed. The bays on the sides of the facade include large arched areas filled primarily with brick; only small arched windows and oculi penetrate these walls. Two belt courses, the lower more prominent than the upper, appear near the top of the facade; one is interrupted by the large arch windows above the entrance, while the other sits immediately above them. Numerous statues stand atop the facade at its significant points, while the building's eastern corner is topped by a domed cupola., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-16. In 1976, Holy Rosary Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and its place in the community's history. It is one of several national parishes with this designation in the city, along with St. Elizabeth's (Hungarian), St. Michael's (German), St. Stanislaus' (Polish), and St. Stephen's (German).

Constructed in the 1880s, the church building has been named a historic site. Throughout its history, the congregation has been focused on Sunday school work. North Presbyterian Church developed out of a mission Sunday school established in east-side Cleveland in 1859. The local presbytery organized a congregation out of the Sunday school in 1867, and within a short while, the new congregation formed the first of two mission Sunday schools in other locations. When the present building was constructed, it was designed to facilitate Sunday schools, with small classrooms surrounding the sanctuary.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 252-253. Members arranged for the present building to be erected in the mid-1880s: construction began in 1886 and continued into the following year. It is an eclectic structure, mixing Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival design elements in an unusual manner. A central tower protrudes slightly from the rest of the facade; it is topped by a steep pyramidal roof. At the base of the tower is the main entrance, and small vertical windows shelter a belfry immediately below the base of the roof; a large window fills nearly all of the space between the main entrance and the belfry. On each side of the tower, the facade is divided into four bays by buttresses running from foundation to the roof, topped by steep pinnacles. Each bay includes two small windows at ground level and a massive window, similar to the one in the tower, that fills most of the width and height in the bay.

In late 1974, North Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in local history. Critical to this designation was the congregation's dedication to religious education, as seen both in its history and its architecture. The general design elements were unusual for period churches, and the floor plan that concentrated on the Sunday school space was highly distinctive; together, these themes caused the church to be a unique example of late nineteenth-century churches in the region.

Background Barham was the older son of Lieutenant Governor C.E. \\"Cap\\" Barham, who held the second highest statewide office from 1952 to 1956 and was like his son an attorney in Ruston, the seat of Lincoln Parish. His mother was the former Carice Helen Hilburn (1907‚Äì1965). He had a brother, Robert Ewing Barham (1940‚Äì1996), an English professor at Louisiana Tech University, from which Charles Barham received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1958. Barham had graduated in 1952 from Ruston High School and played the position of running back on the 1951 state championship football team under Coach Hoss Garrett. In 2009, Barham was recognized by the Ruston High School Alumni Association as a \\"distinguished alumnus.\\" After his Louisiana Tech student years, he procured his Juris Doctor degree in 1959 from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Barham was a cousin of Republican former State Senators Edwards Barham and Robert J. Barham of Morehouse Parish, who represented an adjoining district. Cousin Robert Barham is secretary of the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Department under Governor Bobby Jindal. Career On December 7, 1963, Barham won his first term in office by unseating the two- term incumbent state Senator B. R. Patton.The Shreveport Times, December 8, 1963, p. 22-A In 1968, Barham was reelected, and his district absorbed much of the territory of his colleague Danny Roy Moore of Homer in Claiborne Parish. In 1971, Barham did not contest a third term in the state Senate and was succeeded by the funeral home operator K.D. Kilpatrick, also of Ruston and formerly of Farmerville, the seat of Union Parish. Kilpatrick did not seek reelection, and Barham staged a political comeback in the 1975 general election, having defeated outgoing State Representative Louise B. Johnson of Bernice in Union Parish. Johnson, a businesswoman and a Louisiana Tech graduate, had based much of her campaign on opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. Barham polled 16,878 votes (52.4 percent) to Johnson's 15,385 ballots (47.6 percent), He drew heavily among African-American voters as well as organized labor. Kilpatrick preceded Barham in death by less than two months. From 1998 to 2001, Barham was the executive director of the interest group, the Casino Association of Louisiana, based in Baton Rouge. Barham died of cancer at the Grace Home hospice in Shreveport. He is survived by his wife, the former Joann Frasier (born August 8, 1933), and their three children, Karla Ann Barham (born c. 1959), Charles E. Barham (born 1961) and wife, Debi Shields Barham, and Lori Barham Sharp and husband, Gary, all of Shreveport, where Barham resided during his retirement. Barham had five grandchildren, Abbie and Matt Sharp, Taylor Barham, Ryan Barham and Charlie Barham. Barham grave marker in Greenwood Cemetery in Ruston Barham's services were held on May 6, 2010 at Trinity United Methodist Church in Ruston. Interment followed at Greenwood Cemetery in Ruston.

The theme of the song differs slightly in that although Alexia likes some of what her lover does, yet he doesn't completely leave her satisfied and that she doesn't want to be left in her current way of being moderately satisfied. Although listed by the Italian Wikipedia Alexia page as being a radio single, a physical CD was released on 24 June 2002http://www.eurokdj.com/search/eurodb.php?name=Alexia with \\"Se Un Gornio\\" as the B side, with the song being listed as a single on Alexia's official website. The track featured on both of Sony's budget Alexia compilations, Collections and Le Pui' Belle Di.

Sea trade out of Grimsby dates to at least the medieval period. The Grimsby Haven Company began dock development in the late 1700s, and the port was further developed from the 1840s onwards by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR) and its successors. The port has had three main dock systems: The earliest dock, or Old Dock was developed in the 1790s, downriver from the medieval Haven, on the outfall of the same water course; in around 1880 it was expanded westwards, and renamed Alexandra Dock, being connected to the Royal Dock system by a short canal, named the Union Dock. From the 1880s the dock's focus was coal, later timber. From the 1970s onwards the dock has been used for large-scale car importation. The Royal Dock was developed from the 1840s onwards, contemporary with the arrival of the railway ‚Äì it was built on a large area of land reclaimed from the Humber Estuary north-east of the original town and harbour. The dock's trade has included a wide variety of goods including coal, timber and general merchandise. The third dock system is the Fish docks, all of which exit(ed) from the same lock(s) onto the Humber close to and east of the Royal Dock lock. The first fish dock (\\"No.1\\") was built 1857, and expanded southward in 1878 with the addition of a second (\\"No.2\\"); both were built within the land reclaimed as part of the Royal Dock development. In 1934 a third fish (\\"No.3\\") dock substantially expanded the No.1 dock, and reclaimed additional land from the Humber. The Fish docks and nearby estate were devoted to the landing of fish, and maintenance, supply and repair of the Grimsby fishing fleet, which grew into one of the largest in Britain. The fishing industry collapsed in the 1970s due to outside factors. The Grimsby Haven Company was re-incorporated as the Grimsby Dock Company, which amalgamated in 1846 with several railway companies into the MSLR, later known as the Great Central Railway (GCR). The GCR (and docks) became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) during the 1923 Grouping. In 1948 nationalisation formed the British Transport Commission from which British Transport Docks Board was split in 1962. Privatisation by the Transport Act 1981 formed Associated British Ports, the present owner of the port. As of 2015 the port is a major car importation location, as well as an offshore wind farm servicing hub, and handles other cargos including timber, minerals, metals and dry bulks. History=Early history Grimsby's development as a landing place and town has an underlying basis in the area's geography ‚Äì the combination of relatively (compared to surrounding land) high ground of over , near to the Humber, and close to a water outfall (The Haven). Grimsby has been documented as a landing place dating to at least the Viking Age. According to 19th century writers Grimsby was referenced in medieval histories as the landing place of marauding Danish armies. The haven is also reputed to be the landing place of the semi- legendary figures Grim and Havelok in the town's founding myth, Havelok the Dane (written ). In the second year of the reign of King John (12th century) he visited the town and conferred on its inhabitants the right that \\"they should be exempt from toll and lastage, stallage, moorage, haustage, and passage, in every town and seaport throughout England, except the city of London ..\\", the town was also granted the right of a ferry in the same year. Henry III granted the town a ferry across the Humber, as well as a charter of merchandise. Records of trade with Scandinavian countries date to the 11th century, with furs, wool, and falcons being traded. Importation of pine and oil from Norway is recorded from the early 13th century; grain was exported. Fish and fishmongery in Grimsby are well documented as a part of trade and business from at least the late 12th century, and continued as important until the 16th century. In the 13th century the people of Grimsby came into dispute with the people of the then-thriving port town of Ravenserodd over the alleged 'hijacking', either by persuasion or force, of trade intended for Grimsby to the port of Ravenserodd. An inquisition into the rivalry was held in 1290 by order of Edward II. Later during Edward II's war with France, the Mayor and bailiffs were commanded to equip Grimsby ship, place them under the command of James Kingston, and then patrol the coast of eastern England, capturing and impounding any French or allied vessels. The West Haven (River Freshney) and 18th century maltings (2008) The Haven and was prone to silting, and in 1280 proposals were made to divert the River Freshney to scour the harbour. By 1341 a new haven, the West Haven had been constructed, excavated from former pasture land. During the 14th and 15th century, trade with Scandinavia declined, in part due to Hansa competition, whilst trade with the Low Countries increased, during this period the port faced increased competition from the developing ports at Hull and Boston. As continental trade decreased, fishing and general coastal trade increased in importance for the port. Icelandic fishing and importation of timber from Norway took place but declined from the 15th to 17th centuries. By the end of the 18th century the place had greatly decreased in importance as a port, and many of what remained of the inhabitants got a living from the land. The population had diminished from around 1,500 persons in 1400 to an estimated 850 in 1524, and 399 in the early 1700s. de la Pryme visited in 1697 and noted the towns decline. De la Pryme noted efforts to unblock the haven on his visit, and in the same period work was underway to divert and use the Freshney to scour the West Haven. Parts of the haven are now listed structures, as are maltings on the quayside, parts of which date to the late 1700s. The Old Dock (1796‚Äì1880) Plans to re-engineer the haven and create a new dock were put forward from the late 1800s. Pickernell produced a plan for a dock in 1787. It was not until 1796 that an act named \\"An Act for Widening, Deepening, Enlarging, Altering, and Improving the Haven and Town and Port of Great Grimsby\\" was enacted, creating the Grimsby Haven company. The act noted that the River ('Haven') at Grimsby was warped (silted) up, preventing most ships docking transferring cargo subject to the state of the tides, and so, suggested widening, deepening, and straightening the haven, installing a lock to impound water within the lock, and redirecting the flow of the Freshney (and of springs known as Blow Wells) to scour and fill the lock, allowing larger vessels reliable harbourage at the town. The act sought permission to create a company to fulfill these task, which would also be responsible for erection of wharfs, warehouses; maintenance; tolls and so on; and to gain authority for compulsory purchase of lands required for the works. The acts also set out the regulation of the said company, and gave the company certain rights to make bye-laws relating to the operation of the dock. The act permitted the raising of ¬£20,000, and a further ¬£10,000 in contingency. Construction took place from 1797 to 1800 under John Rennie. George Joyce was initially resident engineer, but was replaced by James Hollinsworth who was present 1800 to 1801. The dock construction required hollow dock walls on piled foundations which were designed in account of the weak ground conditions at the dock site. The cost of the works was ¬£60,000. As built the locked canal was long, with a single lock long by wide, with a depth at the walls of . The dock works were carried out under the shield of a coffer dam outside the new lock, with extensive use of piling under the lock and wall constructions. Use of piles was attempted under the lock pit bottom but the ground was too fluid for this to be successful and an inverted arch was employed instead Further expansion was required, and a further act obtained in 1799. which allowed the construction of an expansion of the dock of . The expansion was completed in 1804. The dock had a depth of water of reducing to towards the town, and to on the west branch of the dock (1846); silting required the dock to be periodically cleared, which had been done in 1826, by hand, and later in the 1840s by machine dredger of approximately . Between of mud was removed from the dock in 1826. After opening there was an initial growth of the town, but from 1811 to 1841 the rate of expansion was no different from the rest of Lincolnshire; the port lacked any rail connection until the 1840s. By the 1850s the dock was involved in trade with the Baltic region, including timber, deal, tar, seeds, bones, and iron. Dock fees were less than those in Hull. 1872 swing bridge In 1869 the Great Grimsby Improvement Act allowed the land west of the Old Dock to be developed, and a bridge, known as Corporation Bridge, built across the dock. The bridge was constructed by Head Wrightson and the Teesdale Ironworks to the design of Charles Sacre. The bridge was supported on concrete filled screw piles, with two spans of and four of . Situated between the two sets of spans was a horizontally turning swing bridge of of asymmetric hogback plate girder design with a clear space when open of . The bridge opened in 1872. In 1873 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway was enabled by an act () to build a short line connecting from their line (Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway) near Great Coates to the Old Dock. Logan and Hemingway obtained the contract to construct the line with a bid of ¬£3,984, and construction began in November 1878. The line (Great Coates branch) opened 27 March 1879. In 1880 the dock was modernised and extended substantially to the west, forming the Alexandra Dock. A short canal dock, the Union Dock was opened in 1879, connecting the Old Dock system, to the Royal Dock system. The dock's lock was closed in 1917 and later infilled. =Alexandra Dock (1880‚Äì)= Grimsby, Ordnance Survey 6 inch map, Lincolnshire 22NE . Alexandra Dock extension (centre left); Royal and Fish docks (top right) In 1873 the dock owners, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway acquired of land to the west of the Old Dock. A scheme for dock creation at South Killingholme near Immingham by Charles Liddell was considered as an alternative, but rejected. In December Logan and Hemingway became contractors for an expansion of the Old Dock. the works included an expansion of the 1789 Old Dock, plus a large western arm extending from near the entrance. In honor of a visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales (Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark) to the town in July 1879 the new dock was named Alexandra Dock. The expanded dock was filled with water in November 1879, and reported complete in July 1880. Contracts for handling equipment, and jetties and coal drops, as well as a swing bridge across the Old Dock's lock were let soon after. The bridge connected rail lines from the Great Coates branch to lines on the west side of the Royal Dock.Ordnance Survey 1888‚Äì1889. 1:2500 In the 1920s a replacement bridge across the dock (Corporation Bridge) was constructed to the design of Alfred C. Gardner, docks engineer of the LNER, constructed by Sir William Arrol & Co. (Glasgow). The bridge consists of four spans, one of which is an electrically powered lifting section on the Scherzer rolling lift principle. The bridge was formally opened by the Prince of Wales (Edward VIII) on 19 July 1925. The bridge was listed in 1999. By the 1930s one of the two original coal drops was out of operation, with coal handling at the port being transferred to new equipment at the Royal Dock. By the 1950s both coal drops had been removed, with the embankments remaining; cargo handling at the dock had shifted to timber; by the end of the 1960s the timber trade had also declined. In 1975 Grimsby was selected as the UK importation point for Volkswagen and a car terminal was opened on Alexandra Dock in 1975. Royal and Fish DocksBackground and construction of cofferdam (1846‚Äì48)= The new Royal and first Fish dock, . showing (left to right) Humber, low water mark, basin piers, docks, railway and town (up is south-east) James Rendel was requested to draw up plans for new docks in 1843. His design placed docks on the extensive mudflats between high and low water north of the town ‚Äì as planned were to be enclosed or reclaimed, of which would be water within the docks, with for wharfage, and of land for other buildings. The main dock was to be connected to the Humber by a basin of bounded by piers of open construction to the east and west each of approximately . The dock's entrance was to have two locks, one large and one small, Rendel also proposed a canal connecting the old and new docks, both for ships and to supply the new docks with fresh water. Part of the basis of the design was to expose the dock entrance to the flow of tides for the greatest amount of time to increase scouring of the entrance, additionally Rendel supposed that the encroachment of the dock onto the Humber might constrict the flow of water in the vicinity of the \\"Inner Roads\\" to increase the flow, and thence scouring, so as to increase the depth of the navigable channel. Rendel also suggested reclaiming and extending eastwards the shallows at the Burcom Bank shoal north-west of Grimsby to further funnel the tidal flows. Total cost of the works was estimated at ¬£500,000, of which ¬£300,000 for the dock works, and up to ¬£200,000 for the breakwaters if carried out. To make the plan economically sensible Rendel proposed that the inner expansion of the docks would be carried out piecemeal, with only of docks built at the initial phase. At an inquest into the state of harbours undertaken by the Tidal Harbours Commission in 1846 the opinion was expressed that if Grimsby the new dock as well as better inland communications it would become the popular and natural fishing port for the east coast. The work was enabled by the Grimsby Dock Act of 1845. As part of the act the Grimsby Haven company was dissolved, and the business re-incorporated as the Grimsby Dock company. The company's plans were enabled by a close association with the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway (GG&SJ;), a company planning to create railway lines from Grimsby and the north Lincolnshire coast to Gainsborough, and connections with the main rail network. The two companies shared several board members and a chairman; the Grimsby Dock company voted to amalgamate with the GG&SJ; at its first general meeting. In 1846 an act of parliament amalgamated the Dock company, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway, the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway, the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway and the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Extension Railway companies into the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway. Work on the dock began in 1846, to the designs of Rendel, with Adam Smith as resident engineer. Contractors for the dock works were Hutching, Brown and Wright. The initial main work was construction of a large cofferdam surrounding the worksite. The dam was constructed of three rows of wooden piles of Baltic yellow pine (Memel fir.), apart, between square, piledriven until hard clay was reached. Piles were between with some longer ‚Äì the outer row was inclined to the vertical at 1 in 24. The inner space was filed with chalkstone and clay for the first then with puddled clay. The inside of the dam was buttressed by additional rows, spaced every of wall, of closely piled wooden piles extending back ; the intermediate space of wall was supported by horizontal diagonal struts from the inner walls to buttresses. The embankments to the east and west of the dam with were made with piled stones and clay. By 1848 an area of was enclosed from the sea. A wide gated opening on the east side allowed access for construction ships. The dam was approximately long, with a construction cost of ¬£29 per foot. The total length of dam, wharves, and embankments approached . Contractor for the cofferdams was Messrs. Lynn (Liverpool). The work was described in a paper read to the Institution of Civil Engineers, obtaining a favourable reception from its vice-president: =Construction of Royal Dock (1849‚Äì1852)= 17 April 1849 Albert, Prince Consort laid the first stone of the dock, an 11-ton stone forming part of the structure of the lock gates. The enclosed area had been drained by two pumps ‚Äì on a number of occasions fresh water springs were encountered, which were managed by enclosing the spring in a cast iron pipe, and by surrounding the area with chalkstone. Two main locks were constructed, adjacent to one another, of and with the bases below low water respectively. The lock's foundations were excavated to below the bottom of the locks, supported on wooden piles square by long, and a bed of concrete. The lock pit invert and supports for the lock gates were of stone. Each lock had a pair of outer (pen) gates and a single inner (flood) gates, all built of timber, reinforced by wrought iron. The dock's quaysides were built on chalk rubble filled brick arches parallel to the dock of approximately width, with the arches on piers of width supported by piling, with wider piers under areas expected to support the heaviest loads ‚Äì the walls facing the dock were faced with masonry. Dock hydraulic tower and locks (1999) Moving equipment for the dock gates was supplied by W. Armstrong. The hydraulic power supply for the equipment was a high water tower (Grimsby Dock tower), charged by a horizontal engine. The hydraulic tower was built on the centre pier between the two locks, of plain brick, square at the base. Its water tank was located at and contained . The tower's architectural design was by J.W. Wild and was inspired by Italian buildings, in particular the town hall of Siena (Torre del Mangia in the Palazzo Pubblico). A tidal basin outside the locks was formed by two timber piers, with an entrance wide. The cost of the dock works (to 1863) was estimated at ¬£600,000; rising to ¬£1,000,000 when accounting for the cost of purchase of the Old Docks, Fish Dock, and interest payments. The dock opened in 1852. On 18 March a banquet was held in the large lock pit, and water was admitted on 22 March, and the dock opened on 27 May 1852. The dock's railway lines of which included lines for the Grimsby Docks railway station and Grimsby Pier railway station were completed by 1 August 1853. Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort visited Grimsby on 14 October 1854, arriving from Hull on the Royal Yacht Fairy, being received at the Pier station. A request for the new dock to be named Royal Dock in honor of the visit was given, and accepted. =History of the Royal Dock (1852‚Äìpresent)= Installations added after the opening of the dock included a graving dock, and facilities for handling rail borne coal shipments. The two coal drops and rail lines were built over the far end of the dock on timber piers. the first was completed by 1856 at a cost of ¬£3,435, the second, at ¬£3,500, soon after. The graving dock was built east of the dock's lock, with an entrance of . The design was by Adam Smith, and was contracted to James Taylor (Manchester) for ¬£32,000 in 1855, the work was completed by 1858. Initially a Cornish engine from Perran Foundry (Cornwall) was installed to fill the dock with water from wells, but its use ended when the well's water supply failed. A short canal dock, the Union Dock was opened in 1879, connecting the Old Dock system, to the Royal Dock system A large transit shed was added to the west side of the dock, opened March 1893. The shed was authorised 1890 at a cost of ¬£23,500 and contracted to Pearson and Knowles (Warrington). A new hydraulic coal hoist and sidings were added to the south-west side of the dock in the last years of the 19th century at a cost of ¬£11,000 ‚Äì the installation became operational in 1899. A Roll-on/roll-off ramp was constructed in the north-east part of the dock . In the 1970s an access road and bridge was built across the smaller lock, restricting use of the lock. In 2013 Dong Energy selected the Royal Dock as an operation and maintenance centre for the Westermost Rough Wind Farm. As part of the agreement new pontoons and lock gates were to be installed. In 2014 the lock gates at the dock were replaced by contractor Ravestein (Netherlands). The conversion away from gates partially supported by buoyancy lifted the opening restrictions to times of high water, allowing 24hr operations. The floating pontoon berth was sited in the north-east corner of the dock, at the site of the (1966) roll-on/roll-of ramp. The operations and maintenance centre was to be sited adjacent to the berth on the north-east corner of the quayside. Parts of the dock's wall, the locks, the dock tower, and several nearby structures are all now listed structures. =Fish Docks (1857‚Äì)= Fish docks, Grimsby () :In the 21st century also known as Grimsby Dock East. The Fish Docks consist of a number of docks sharing common lock entrances, east of the Royal Dock, built and expanded in stages from the mid 19th century onwards. No.1 Dock (1857‚Äì) The first fishing dock (later No.1 Fish Dock) was authorised in late 1854, and the construction contract awarded to Sissons at ¬£6,996; the dock was completed early 1856. It was constructed to the east of the Royal Dock, and incorporated the floodgates of the original cofferdam at lock gates. The dock's lock was with a depth at high spring tides of . As built the dock's sides were of chalkstone covered sloped clay at with a 1 in 3 rise, at the south side a timber wharf was built, which was rail connected by a sunken line allowing direct loading of wagons from the wharf. A timber pier was built to the east of the dock's entrance. The dock was built at a cost of ¬£12,000, with a water area of approximately . The new dock opened in 1857. Fishermen were encouraged to move to the new port; the Grimsby Deep Sea Fishing Company had already been established (1854) for this purpose, backed by Great Central Railway, and later Great Northern Railway and Midland Railway. An ice house and worker's housing were also built in the 1850s to support the industry. The Fish Dock was extended in 1866; doubling the dock's area. A second lock and further quay space and warehousing were contracted to Logan and Hemingway, ; the firm also received the contract for a graving dock, valued at ¬£15,000 in 1872. The pier at the dock was lengthened in 1873. The lock and graving dock were operational by 1875. The fish market on the dock was destroyed by fire in June 1918. Contracts for new fish markets were awarded in 1919: one of ¬£43,878 to A. Jackaman & Sons for work on the west side of the dock; and one of ¬£13,113 to G.A. Pillatt & Son for the north side. Reconstruction of the northern end of the fish market on the west side of the dock was completed by January 1921. Reconstruction work on the fish market continued through 1922 to 1923. In 1934 a new dock, No.3, was opened, contiguous with No.1, expanded the water area of by No.2 Dock (1878‚Äì) No.2 dock, derelict dock buildings (2007) In 1876 Logan and Hemingway were awarded a ¬£23,000 contract for an expansion from the first fish dock. The No. 2 Fish Dock was opened in 1878, connecting at the south end of the extended No.1 Fish Dock. The dock was enlarged to at the southern end between 1897 and 1900; the expansion scheme included the addition of two coal hoists for loading. H.B. James (Grimsby) was awarded the dock wall and excavations contracts. The dock expansion also necessitated the realignment of the Grimsby to Cleethorpes railway line to the south. (As of 2015) A marina (Meridian Quay Marina) uses the northern half of No.2 dock. No.3 Dock (1934‚Äì) 1934 diagram (The Engineer). No.3 Dock extension in the context of Nos. 1 & 2 Fish and Royal docks A need for an additional fish dock was seen from the early 20th century ‚Äì the Great Central Railway (GCR) obtained an act for a fish dock in 1912 (); the dock was to extend No.1 dock to the east onto land reclaimed from the Humber. The scheme was abandoned due to the eruption of the First World War, after which the cost of the scheme has increased from the initial estimate of ¬£0.5 million to ¬£1.2 million; as a result, the scheme was not proceeded with. Later the GCR's successor the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) proposed to the Grimsby Corporation that if the Corporation built a dock, the LNER would pay rent for use of the dock, until such time as the cost of dock and loans were repaid, at which point it would take over the dock ‚Äì this scheme was agreed with and the Corporation applied for a bill in Parliament. The Grimsby Corporation (Dock, etc.) Act was passed in 1929. The dock was initially designed by chief dock engineer of the LNER J.A. Wickham, who died April 1930, and was succeeded by A. Tulip. The firm of John Wolfe Barry and partners were appointed engineers. Funding was aided by a governmental grant, intended to reduce unemployment. The works included a reclamation of land to the north-east of the original fish dock, and a new river embankment of extending east-south-east into the district of Cleethorpes, enclosing substantial additional land in addition to the dock, including areas for railway sidings and up to for industrial development. The north quay of No.1 dock (known as \\"Campbell's Jetty\\") was to be removed, making the No.1 and new fish docks contiguous with one another ‚Äì the new dock water area was giving a total water area of the No.1 and No.3 docks of . Planned dock facilities included a north quay, rail fed coaling jetties on the east quay, and outfitting jetties and slipways on the south-east side. A third lock wide was to be constructed adjacent east and parallel with the existing locks of the fish dock; additionally the fish dock east entrance pier was to be removed, and a new pier constructed on the east side of the new lock. Other changes required included the rerouting of a sewer and its outfall channel further east. The estimated cost of the works was ¬£1.418 million of which the Corporation was enabled to raise ¬£1.25 million, the remainder by the LNER, who agreed to a thirty-year lease on the dock. The company of Sir Lindsay Parkinson was contracted to carry out the work. A.E. Tarrant was the resident engineer. Work on the dock began in November 1930. The diversion of sewer, river embankment, and steel sheet pile cofferdam for construction of the new lock were all complete by May 1932. The embankment was constructed primarily of tipped chalk, faced on the seaward side with concrete blocks. Dock construction required excavation of approximately of material, primarily by dragline excavator, much of which was used to fill other areas of the newly enclosed land. Spoil and slag from Scunthorpe was also used as fill on the reclaimed land. The new 45 ft lock was long total with three gates. It was built on square timber piles, supporting a square bottomed concrete lock pit. 'Blows', (underground springs) were encountered when excavating the lock's west wall foundations, undermining the work, and causing the newly laid concrete to crack. Work was delayed by remedial work to counter these springs, consisting of sunken centrifugal pumps used to draw of the water, temporarily reducing the local level of the water table. The lock was faced with granite. A pipe subway lined with cast iron segmental rings ran under part of the lock, carrying services (hydraulic, water, electricity). The initially installed gates were of oak, operated by hydraulically activated chains. The new east pier was long and constructed of timber, on the west side part of the old pier was removed and a new pier section added, meeting the old at a \\"V\\". Construction of the dock's quays was delayed due to the weak ground conditions encountered, necessitation a partial redesign, and increasing cost. The north and south quays were supported on square reinforced piles spaced laterally and longitudinally at a distance of . Larssen sheet piling was used at the rear of the quays, with a tipped chalk bank behind. The north quay showed movement before it was completed, and so the quay bank was tied back to anchorages inserted into the river embankment. Approximately of concrete, 1,330 tons of steel reinforcement, and 1,724 piles were used in the north and south quays combined. Fish docks No.1 and No.3 (under construction) from the east. Coaling stages, and slipways (left) in foreground The east quay was built with a 1 in 3 slope retained by concrete sheet piling, and located three coaling stages supplied by the Mitchell Conveyor and Transporter Company, each extended into the dock on a pier. At the south-east side of the dock were slipways. Three adjacent slipways were constructed, with the machinery by Henderson and Nichol (Aberdeen); once lifted a ship would be moved sideways on a rail traverser onto an adjacent berth. The easternmost slipway had two berths, and was capable of lifting a maximum weight of 1,080 tons, and a maximum ship length of . The other two slipways had lifting capacities of 600 tons, the centre slipway had two berths, the other three. Slipway and yard foundations were constructed from reinforced concrete, supported by concrete piles. Main road access to the dock was by a reinforced concrete bridge from Humber Street (now Humber Bridge Street) crossing the main Grimsby to Cleethorpes railway line by five main spans. The works included the movement of existing rail sidings; plus construction of new general and coaling sidings, east of the dock. The dock was supplied with power from a 6,000 V supply from the LNER's power station at Immingham. Electricity substations were supplied by Metropolitan- Vickers, and lighting by the General Electric Company Ltd. No.3 Fish Dock was opened 4 October 1934 by Sir Henry Betterton. In 2012 Centrica opened an operations and maintenance base on the north wall (fish dock), for use with the Lynn and Inner Dowsing Wind Farm and the Lincs Wind Farm. In 2013 as part of the arrangements to bring E.on to the dock, the dock's lock gates were modernised. In 2014 E.on opened an operations and maintenance base for its Humber Gateway Wind Farm. In 2015 work to refurbish the 1935 boat repair slipways was initiated. =Grimsby Fish Market (1996‚Äì)= Fish Dock and fish market (2003) In 1996 a new fish market (Grimsby Fish Market) was built on reclaimed land on a former fish dock (No.1). The majority of the fish sold at the market was not landed at Grimsby, but imported; approximately two thirds was supplied from Icelandic fishers, the remainder from other North Sea fishing nations (2006). The market handled 30,000 tons of fresh fish in 2006, approximately one third of the Grimsby total. Union Dock (1879‚Äì) The Union Dock was designed as a short canal from the end of the Royal Dock to inner of the Old Dock. Logan and Hemingway were awarded the contract to build the dock, with a bid of ¬£81,000. Work on the dock began 30 August 1873, and the final stone was laid 11 July 1879. The construction was hampered by poor ground conditions leading to the weight if the dockwalls displacing the adjacent ground. The total length of the dock, including lock was , with a water area of ; the lock was long by wide. Tannet, Walker and Company were awarded a ¬£3,677 contract for a hydraulically operated swing bridge across the dock; the bridge was long carrying a single line of rail, plus walkways. Total cost of the dock was ¬£258,700. Union Dock was opened 22 July 1879 by the Prince and Princess of Wales (Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark). In the 1970s the canal was widened out, as part of the arrangements to allow large car carriers into Alexandra Dock. Humber Commercial Railway and Dock () In 1900 the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock sought powers from parliament to build a new dock west adjacent to the Royal Dock, and north of Alexandra Dock, on the banks of the Humber; this development was passed in 1901 as the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act. The approach channel to the dock would have required extensive dredging, which may have had negative consequences on the adjacent docks; and as a consequence the Great Central Railway informed the promoters of the scheme it was to withdraw its support, unless the scheme was changed to one better positioned on the Humber, near Stallingborough, nearer to a deep water channel. In 1903 the company submitted amended plans to replace the previous consented dock at Grimsby with a new construction at Immingham, passed in as the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act, 1904. This dock act led to the construction of the Immingham Dock. Grimsby River Terminal (2013‚Äì) In 2011 ABP received planning consent for a 2 berth terminal on the Humber outside the locked docks connected to the estate via a pier from the northwest corner of Royal Dock. The terminal was designed to increase the car importation ship capacity from 800 to 30,000 cars. Capital cost of the project was estimated at ¬£25.1 million. Construction was undertaken by Graham construction. The terminal consisted of an approach jetty approximately long; a floating concrete pontoon of , deep weighing over 7,000 ton; a linkspan bridge connecting the pontoon to jetty; and a finger pier dividing the two berthing positions. The installation was constructed using 165 tubular steel piles between diameter, up to long. The terminal was completed and commissioned on 22 July 2013. The first vessel to dock at the terminal was the MV Ems Highway in July 2013. Official opening took place in September 2013. Marine Control Centre (2015‚Äì) In 2016 ABP, in its role as Statutory Harbour Authority for the Humber Estuary and for the ports of Immingham, Grimsby, Hull and Goole, began work on relocating its Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) centre at Spurn Point to a new Marine Control Centre in Grimsby, following deterioration of road access to Spurn. The new control centre was to be located at the northern edge of the docks, between Royal and Fish docks. Port employment, trade and tonnage After connection to the rail network, coupled with expansion of the port, and wider industrial development the tonnage handled through the port increased from around 160 kilotons in 1854, to nearly 3,800 kilotons in 1911. The opening and growth of Immingham Dock coupled with a wider decline in exports reduced tonnage to around 620 kilotons by 1938. After the Second World War the tonnage peaked at 1,500 kilotons in 1956, and declined to 640 kilotones by 1962. Growth of the Grimsby fishing fleet caused the tonnage of fish landed to increase from 0.188 kilotons in 1855; to 30 kilotons in 1871, with 302 vessels operating from the port. Steam fishing began , and this, coupled with diminishing North Sea fish stocks caused fishing to take place increasingly further afield ‚Äì in 1911 landings from UK boats at the port were 190 kilotons. Demand was reduced in the interwar period, though recovered to 198 kilotons in 1951. Grimsby landed approximately 20% of UK fish in this period. In the mid 1960s the fishing fleet employed directly several thousands of men, with over 250 fishing vessels, with many more people employed indirectly. ¬£13 million worth of fish was landed at the port in 1965, out of a UK total of ¬£40 million. The problems of declining catches and increased fuel costs were exacerbated by the introduction of fishing zone limits (Exclusive economic zones) by several North Atlantic nations, as well fishing limits introduced with the membership of the European Economic Community. Landings dropped to 24 kilotons of fish by 1983. In 1976, prior to the collapse of the Humber fishing fleet the fishing industry employed 11,750 people in Grimsby, including land based work, representing 17% of employment. Grimsby's fishing industry was less affected than the Port of Hull due to a more diversified fishing fleet, in comparison to the Hull fleet's reliance on deep water fishing. Though fish continued to be imported into Grimsby for processing, much of it began to arrive by road from other ports, and not via the docks. Fish processing activities remained an important employment sector in the town after the collapse of the sea-based fishing industry ‚Äì with over 6,000 persons employed in 1984, representing a nationally significant percentage of all fish processing based employment in the UK in the 1980s, with extensive cold storage facilities on and off the dock estates. In the 1980s major freight imports included Volkswagen cars, timber from the Scandinavia and Russia, Danish food produce; exports included manufactured goods, and steel slab from Scunthorpe. Other structures=Historic Many buildings were constructed on and around the dock estate servicing related industries. The streets west of the fish dock was one such area, with a concentration of fish processing related activities and businesses ‚Äì several buildings in the area are now listed due to their relationship to the fishing industry; these include: a fish processing and smoking factory, brick, late 19th century, on Fish Dock Road; two fish smoking factories on Henderson Street: one of yellow brick with red brick dressing, late 19th century; the other in red brick with concrete tile roof, late 19th and early 20th century; two fish processing and smoking factories on Sidebottom Street : one dating to around 1900 in red brick (with rendering) with 20th century alterations; the other in yellow brick (rendered) dating to the early 20th century; a fish processing and smoking factory on Riby Street, in yellow and red brick, with render, dating to the early 20th century; and a fish processing and smoking factory on Maclure Street, dating from the interbellum, converted from late 19th/early 20th century smithy building. The fishing industry required ice to preserve the caught fish, and Grimsby had a number of ice factories, one of which, also on the dock estate west of the fish dock, now known as the Grimsby Ice Factory, is now a listed building. The building dates to the beginning of the 20th century, is of red brick, and was formerly the factory of the Grimsby Ice Company Limited. On the east side of Royal Dock, the former flour mill, \\"Victoria Mills\\", is also listed. The building by architect Alfred Gelder was built in a Flemish style using red brick with blue brick and terracotta dressings, it dates to builds in 1889 and 1905. Part of the mill has been converted into flat accommodation, whilst, as of 2015, the other part is unoccupied and derelict. The directly dock related Dock Offices and Customs House are also listed, located near the junction of the Royal and Union docks, close to Cleethorpes Road: The Dock Offices were built in 1885 by Mills and Murgatroyd for the Grimsby Dock Company, an H plan building of three storeys, in brick with stone and terracotta dressing; the Customs House dates to 1874, two storeys with five bays, in red brick, with stone and black brick dressings. To the front of the Dock Office is a bronze statue of Albert, Prince Consort commissioned to William Theed in celebration of the Royal visit to the opening of the Union Dock in 1879. The sites of the Royal Dock cofferdam, and of the Royal Dock's graving dock are also now listed as historic monuments by Historic England. Modern In 2013 a two-year project of construction of a flood wall around the docks began, with an estimated cost of around ¬£20 million.

In 2012, the Port of Immingham was the largest port in the United Kingdom by tonnage with 60 million tonnes of cargo passing through that year. The port was established by the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Company in association with the Great Central Railway; the dock company incorporated and the works permitted by the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act of 1901. Construction of the dock started in 1906 and was completed by 1912. The original main purpose of the dock was export of coal. In the second half of the 20th century the port was considerably expanded beyond its locked dock, and east and west jetties; with the addition of several deep water jetties for bulk cargos: this included the Immingham Oil Terminal (1969, expanded 1994) for oil importation to the new Continental Oil and Lindsay Oil refineries; the Immingham Bulk Terminal (1970) built as a joint scheme by the NCB and BSC for coal export and iron ore import; the Immingham Gas Jetty (1985) for LPG import; and the Humber International Terminal (2000, expanded 2006) for bulk cargos. Roll-on/Roll-off terminals were first operated in 1966, and expanded within the dock in the 1990s, and outside the dock at the Immingham Outer Harbour (2006) History=Background From the mid 19th century onwards the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway developed the Port of Grimsby into a modern outlet for its rail system onto the east coast of England. In 1874 a report was commissioned from Charles Liddell on alternatives to expansion at Grimsby ‚Äì it recommended a new dock west of Grimsby at South Killingholme, preferable due to low land costs and proximity to the Humber Estuary's navigable channel. Liddel's scheme was not proceeded with at that time. In 1900 the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Company was formed with the aim of expanding the Grimsby Docks system ‚Äì it sought powers from parliament to build a new dock west adjacent of the Royal Dock, and north of Alexandra Dock, on the banks of the Humber; this development was passed in 1901 as the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act. The Great Central Railway (GCR), owner of the Grimsby Docks was willing to back the scheme, but sought the advice of Sir John Wolfe Barry, who reported that the approach channel to the dock would have required extensive dredging; he later reported in favour of a scheme near Immingham, similar in location to that earlier proposed by Liddel. The GCR acquired land near their preferred dock, and informed the promoters of the scheme it was to withdraw its support, unless the scheme was changed to one better positioned on the Humber, near Stallingborough, nearer to a deep water channel; Plans were submitted to parliament in 1902 for a dock near Immingham, but the bill was withdrawn due to conditions requiring the GCR to dredge the Humber shipping channels to undo any change thought to have been caused by the dock works. Under pressure from interested parties the Board of Trade commissioned an inspection of the channels, which reported that no serious negative change would be expected from the new dock works. A bill was re-submitted in 1903. Features of the scheme were: a new dock in the parish of Immingham with lock and entrance channel, with jetties on the east and west side; a railway with a junction north of the Great Central Railway's line at Ulceby station to the dock; and rights to dredge, divert streams (Immingham Haven), to raise funds, to make working arrangements with the Great Central Railway; and rights of compulsory purchase. The scheme was passed as the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act, 1904. The 1904 act was modified by subsequent acts in 1908, 1909, and 1913, which extended the time for construction, allowed raising additional capital, and made minor changes to the original plans. The primary purpose of the dock was export of coal from Derbyshire and Yorkshire coalfields. Construction and opening, 1906‚Äì1912 Immingham Dock and rail lines, The dock was designed by the firm of Sir John Wolfe Barry and partners, and contracted to Price, Wills and Reeves (Westminster), constructed on a site of over , with a river frontage of about . Work was formally initiated on the dock by Lady Henderson, wife of the Great Central chairman Alexander Henderson in July 1906. Three new short railway lines were sanctioned and constructed to connect to the dock from the west, east and south: these were the Humber Commercial Railway with a connection away at Ulceby, on the former Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway (GG&SJR;); the Barton and Immingham Light Railway ran from a junction near Goxhill (GG&SJR;) connecting to the Humber Commercial line at a junction on the west side of the dock estate; and the Grimsby District Light Railway to Grimsby connecting via a junction onto the Humber Commercial line, on the east side of the dock estate. The light railway to Grimsby was connected to the Great Coates branch by 1906; the line was used during the construction of the dock by the contractors, and a passenger service was begun in 1910. Initial work on the dock included diversion of drains, and dredging of the entrance channel to the Humber. Approximately of excavated material from the dock was used in the construction for levelling. The dock walls were made of concrete, with granite coping; the lock pit was constructed with concrete side walls and a shallow inverted arch of brickwork at the invert. Installation of the lock gates and their machinery was by Head Wrightson. As built (1912) the dock consisted of a main basin square, with two arms to the north-west and south-west of approximately long by wide; a total enclosed area of . The design incorporated space for two further arms on the east side, mirroring the western arms. The entrance lock was split by lock gates into sections of ; the lock had of water depth at ordinary spring tides. At the entrance where two jetties extending into the river, forming a guiding shape for the lock entrance ‚Äì the eastern jetty was intended to be used for passenger services, whilst the western jetty found initial use as a coal loading point. The first dry dock was constructed adjacent parallel west of the entrance lock long by wide, operated by Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Co. subsidiary the Humber Graving Dock & Engineering Co. Ltd.. East of the entrance lock was constructed the Dock Offices, built in an Arts and Crafts influenced style, with a Mansard roof encompassing dormer windows. Coal hoists on the south quay The south quay of the dock was entirely equipped for coal export, with seven coal hoists, with capacity of 400 tons per hour. Extensive sidings were built mainly to the south of the dock, with inbound storage available for 8,000 (loaded) coal wagons, and outbound storage for 3,500 wagons. The north-western arm was initially built as a timber pond, with adjacent rail sidings. Coal hoists were hydraulically powered, supplied by gravity sidings carried across sidings by ferro-concrete bridges built by the Yorkshire Hennebique Contracting Company (Leeds). Six of the hoists were supplied by W.G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company; the seventh, a movable hoist was supplied by Tannet, Walker and Company (Leeds). The north quay of the south-western arm was used for pig iron handling, and was equipped with ten movable cranes from Armstrong Whitworth of lifting capacity of 5 or 3 tons, and a fixed crane with lifting capacity of up to 50 tons. Further cranes from Cowans, Sheldon and Company (Carlisle) were supplied for the transit sheds. The hydraulic and electrical powerstation Much of the dock equipment was power via hydraulic power, whilst electrical power transmission was used for lighting, railway signalling, pumping equipment for the graving dock, and other purposes, including conveyor motors in the grain silo. For both purposes a power station, in ground plan was erected on the dock estate west of the main lock entrance. Steam was supplied by eight long by wide Lancashire boilers at ‚Äì both hydraulic pumping and electrical generator plant was supplied by the same boilers, connected on a ring steam main. Hydraulic power was supplied via four pairs of horizontal condensing steam engines, with cylinder diameters of with stroke, each capable of pumping per minute at to two stroke accumulators. Most of the hydraulic machinery was supplied by W.G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company. Electrical power was provided via Curtis type steam turbines-alternatos of (two machines), , and ; supplying 6,000 V which was stepped down to 320 V to drive rotary converters; distribution of power was via a 3-phase 6,600 V supply to substations on the dock estate, containing rotary converters supplying 460 V DC. The electrical network included a substation halfway between Grimsby and Immingham supplying the Grimsby District Light Railway with 530 V DC; as well as a 1,200 kW 460 V supply via overhead electrical cable to the Grimsby Docks. Most of the electrical equipment was supplied by British Thomson-Houston. The Humber Commercial Railway carried its first goods in July 1910. The Barton and Immingham Light Railway opened May 1911. A distant related work was the Doncaster Avoiding Line sanctioned 1903, and contracted in 1908 ‚Äì the line allowed trains from west of Doncaster to avoid congestion at Doncaster station. An electrified tram line, the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway, parallel to the Grimsby District Light Railway was begun 1909 and opened 1912. On the dock estate a sixty locomotive capacity engine house was constructed. (See also Immingham engine shed.) Due to high demand for coal shipment facilities in the aftermath of a coal strike, the dock was provisionally opened on 15 May 1912. The dock was official opened on 22 July 1912 by the King George V and Queen Mary; at the ceremony permission was given to name the new dock \\"The King's Dock\\", a moniker which did not persist; Sam Fay, general manager of the GCR was unexpectedly knighted by the King during the proceedings. Shortly after opening a large reinforced concrete grain silo was completed (1913), capable of holding 20,000 tons of grain. The silo was built by Stuart's Granolithic Company, and grain handling equipment supplied by Henry Simon (Manchester). History (1914‚Äì1969) Anti aircraft gunnery training, 1940s During the First World War, Immingham was a submarine base for British D class submarine. During the 1930s the port was used for cruise ships, with vessels of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, White Star Line and Blue Star Line calling at the port. During the Second World War the port was used as a naval base, and was the Royal Navy's headquarters for the Humber. Anti-aircraft batteries were located around the dock during the war. During the war John Dowland and Leonard Harrison received the George Cross for defusing a bomb that had fallen onto the grain ship SS Kildare in February 1940 in Immingham Dock. In 1950 a fertilizer plant was established on the dock estate, to the southeast. (See Fisons, Immingham.) In 1957 construction of a new dry dock was begun, after acquisition of the Humber Gracing Dock & Engineering company by Richardsons Westgarth & Company & Co. Ltd.; the new dry dock opened 1960, known as Henderson's Graving Dock. The port's first Roll- on/roll-off facility was constructed in 1966 for Tor Line. History (1970‚Äìpresent) The Immingham Oil Terminal (IOT) jetty on the banks of the Humber west of the dock entrance was opened 1969. The terminal was built to serve the new oil refineries (Continental Oil Refinery and Lindsey Oil Refinery) built near west of the Immingham Dock site. The initial construction consisted of a pier into the Humber with two berths, suitable for ships up to 200,000 dwt. The dolphin berths were constructed from diameter tubes with wall thickness driven over into the underlying ground, in groups of 3 to 6 tubes. Immingham Bulk Terminal was commissioned in 1970 jointly by the National Coal Board (NCB) and British Steel Corporation (BSC) in association with the British Transport Docks Board (BTDB) for the export of coal and import of steel. The cost of the terminal was ¬£11.5 million. The coal terminal was designed to increase the efficiency of coal export by the NCB, the terminal was taken over by the BTDB in 1973, and leased back to the NCB and BSC, it was the NCB's main point of export for coal (1982). The ore terminal was part of British Steel's \\"Anchor\\" modernisation project at its Scunthorpe Steelworks, the ore terminal was completed 1972. Vessel capacities for the terminals were 100,000 dwt for the ore terminal and 35,000 dwt for the coal terminal. A Liquid Petroleum Gas handling jetty \\"Immingham Gas Jetty\\" was opened in 1985 at a cost of ¬£5 million; the terminal was connected to underground storage operated by Conoco and Calor Gas. A third berth was commissioned at the Immingham oil terminal in 1994 at a cost of ¬£18 million. In June 1995 a new ¬£13.5 million terminal was opened for shipping company DFDS. Located on the south-western arm of the dock, in 1999 the terminal had 4 roll-on/roll-off berths on a site. The shipyard at the graving docks closed in 2001. The Henderson Graving Dock has been converted into a shipping berth. Humber International Terminal (HIT) became operational in August 2000. The terminal was built adjacent west of the Immingham Bulk Terminal on the Humber bank; a berth dredged to a depth of . The main work was contracted to Edmund Nuttall Ltd. and HAM Dredging Ltd.. In 2005 Associated British Ports decided to invest a further ¬£15 million on a \\"Phase 2\\" extension of the terminal. The phase two berth extended the terminal's quay by , and was built primarily to handle imported coal. The terminal was formally opened by the Princess Royal in 2006. A new Immingham West Jetty for petrochemical handling was contracted to Edmund Nuttall to a design by engineering firm Halcrow. In 2004 transport minister David Jamieson allowed the construction of a ¬£35 million, 5 berth roll- on/roll-off terminals at the port, for ferry operators DFDS Tor Line, suitable for vessels up to . The Immingham Outer Harbour Revision Order, 2004 permitted the construction of moorings and access ramps south and west of the jetty of the Humber International Terminal; and the removal of part of the Western jetty; as well as permitting dredging of a channel to the terminal to a maximum depth of . Three of the five permitted berths were constructed, and the Immingham Outer Harbour opened 2006. In 2007/8, a ¬£45 million 200,000 ton () pa biofuel plant was constructed at the Port of Immingham, manufacturing biodiesel from vegetable oils. In 2008 a site was acquired in Stallingborough in 2008 to increase off dock estate storage space for cars. The site was operational by 2011. In 2013 ABP began the development of the \\"Immingham Renewable Fuels Terminal\\" on the Humber International Terminal site, as part of a 15-year contract with Drax Power Station to supply biomass (wood pellet) to the powerplant. ABP's total investment in biomass handling facilities, including installations at Hull and Goole was to be around ¬£100 million. In April 2013 Graham Construction was awarded the contract to build the 3 million ton per annum facility, consisting of an automated biomass handling terminal utilizing continuous ship unloaders, with rail and road export facilities, and with 100,000 ton storage capacity, using four silos each of . The project entered the commissioning phase in mid 2014. The second phase of the project was to add a further 3 million tons pa capacity. Two 2,300 ton per hour screw unloading biomass handling cranes were installed by May 2015. In 2018 Associated British Ports (ABP) will take over ownership of British Steel‚Äôs Immingham Bulk Terminal and invest ¬£65 million.The agreement sees ABP form a new business, IBT Limited, which will also manage the terminal located on the west side of the port in Immingham.

Constructed in the 1890s for a congregation founded in the 1850s, it was named a historic site in the 1970s. Congregationalists began operating a Sunday school in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood in 1854, and their efforts resulted in the creation of a church five years later. The members began construction of their first church building in 1865, although it was not completed until 1870. It was suitable for the congregation's needs for only a short time, as construction on the present building was started just 23 years after the first building was finished. The name \\"Pilgrim Congregational Church\\" was adopted in 1894 upon the completion of the present building;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1.

The building was a community landmark from its earliest years ‚Äî electric wiring was included in the original construction at a time when no other Cleveland buildings west of the Cuyahoga River had electricity. Designed by prominent Cleveland architect Sidney Badgley, Pilgrim Congregational cost approximately $150,000 to complete. It is a generally square building typical of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, distinguished by exterior elements such as prominent rose windows on the northern and eastern sides. At the time of construction, the church was deeply involved in social programs in the community; rooms such as recreation space for young men, a library, and a gymnasium take up two-thirds of the building. The tallest section of the church is a square corner tower with a pointed roof; tall arched windows occupy much of its height, with circular windows and a belfry between the arched windows and the top of the tower. The main entrance also is through an arch, placed at the top of a wide flight of stairs., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-12. In 1976, Pilgrim Congregational Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture, which when completed was called an \\"epoch-making church building\\"; just four years after the building was erected, the plans had been used as an example of the latest ecclesiastical architecture at the Paris Exhibition at the turn of the century. It was one of twenty Cuyahoga County locations added to the Register in 1976.

It was built in 1876, received an addition in 1897, and closed due to disrepair in 1953. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It underwent a major renovation beginning in 1995, and reopened in 1998. Constructing the chapel The Riverside Cemetery Association was formed on November 15, 1875. About April 1876, the association's trustees hired the Cleveland architectural firm of Bruch & Monks to design a chapel for the cemetery. The chapel was to be erected at the center of the northern upper plateau of the cemetery, which was the first area to be developed for burials. A long road, called Chapel Avenue, led east from the chapel to the cemetery's eastern boundary. A fountain (never built) was to anchor the eastern end of the road. The chapel itself was a Gothic Revival-style structure constructed of sandstone, with an interior measuring just square. Simple wooden pews faced forward, providing seating for between 80 and 90 persons. The chapel had a single above-ground story, with a full basement which served as a receiving vault. Coffins placed on the dais could be lowered into the receiving vault below mechanically. Narrow bunk-like racks provided space for the storage of coffins and human remains until the spring thaw. Up to 30 coffins could be stored in the receiving vault. Four narrow metal tubes rose from the basement through the north and south roofs to provide ventilation. The building was unheated, and the only light was provided by small dormer windows set high in the roof. Riverside Cemetery was opened on July 8, 1876, on a bluff overlooking the west bank of the Cuyahoga River in the unincorporated village of Brooklyn Centre (now a neighborhood which is part of Cleveland, but then an independent settlement). It was a garden-style cemetery, and at the time of its dedication the largest cemetery on Cleveland's west side. Plans for the chapel were approved by the trustees on August 4, 1876, and construction proceeded immediately and swiftly. The chapel was dedicated on November 9, 1876. The cost of construction was $3,855 ($ in dollars). A formal dedication of the cemetery took place on November 17, 1876. Ohio Governor (and President-elect) Rutherford B. Hayes attended the ceremony, planting a tree on Chapel Avenue. History of the chapel On December 13, 1897, the cemetery trustees voted to approve the addition of a porte-coch√®re to the east side of the chapel. The Cleveland architectural firm of Steffens, Searles & Hirsh was hired to design the alterations, which also included adding a coal-fired furnace and coal room in the basement, a covered rear stairway at the rear of the building to give access to the basement, a dropped ceiling in the interior, and Gothic Revival lead glass windows in the north, south, and west walls. The porte-coch√®re was made of sandstone and designed to be almost stylistically identical to the existing chapel. Medallions were installed over the arches in the porte-coch√®re. The southern medallion depicted a descending dove with an olive branch in its beak, symbolic of peace and the Holy Spirit. The northern medallion depicted a hooded representation of Death, finger to the lips, urging all to be silent. Construction began on July 7, 1898, and was complete on November 3 at a cost of about $2,700 ($ in dollars). In serious need of repair, upgrades, and restorations, the chapel was closed in 1953. The chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. In 1988, several stone roof caps were dislodged and fell to the ground just hours after the funeral of a cemetery trustee was held in the chapel. In 1992, realizing that the chapel was in danger of collapse, the cemetery began a $250,000 fundraising campaign to restore it to full use. A charitable foundation was established to receive monies. Although costs had risen to $285,000, by 1995 the cemetery had $105,000 in hand and decided to proceed with the renovation. The renovation was designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Steven McQuillin & Associates. The restoration included restoring the building to use, removing a brick chimney on the building's west facade (added to vent smoke from the now- disused coal furnace), and removing the ventilation tubes from the roof (since the receiving vault was no longer used). Construction, overseen by Platt Construction Co. of Cleveland, began in the summer of 1995. William Halley, the cemetery's superintendent from 1971 to 2010, oversaw the fundraising and renovation. With the existing pews no longer serviceable, Halley obtained century-old pews for the chapel from Trinity Cathedral, a church also listed on the National Register of Historic Places which was renovating its nave. The renovation was completed in August 1998, and the chapel rededicated in June 1999. At that time, was named the William Halley Chapel in honor of superintendent William Halley.

The earliest ethnic parish established for Hungarians in the United States, its present building was constructed in the early twentieth century, and it has been named a historic site. Parish history Parish hall Cleveland's first Hungarian Catholics initially worshipped at St. Ladislaus' Church, an east-side Slovakian parish, but ethnic strife and increasing immigration prompted the Hungarian community to seek their own parish. Bishop Horstmann interceded on their behalf with papal authorities, and Charles Boehm of Hungary settled in Cleveland in late 1892 to serve the new St. Elizabeth parish, the first Hungarian nationality parish in America. Boehm immediately began registering members and advocating for the construction of a church complex; the first church building, a brick structure, was erected by the end of 1893, a school soon followed, and a larger school was completed in 1900 because of expanded enrollment. He also began a Hungarian-language parish newspaper that soon gained subscribers in other parts of the United States and in Hungary. Julius Szepessy took Boehm's place in 1907 after the latter left to begin missions among Hungarians in America, but after Szepessy died in 1923, Boehm returned and remained until retiring in 1927.Papp, Susan M. Hungarian Americans and Their Communities of Cleveland. Cleveland: Cleveland State University, 1981. The parish was weakened in 1904 as Hungarian Catholics living in western Cleveland began to weary of their three-hour round trip for Mass. With Boehm's support, the new St. Emeric's Church was created for them; it was the first of more than a dozen Hungarian parishes established directly or indirectly through his influence. Nevertheless, Boehm's remaining parishioners were numerous enough that the old building was insufficient for their needs, and by the time of his departure in 1907, he had begun to raise money for the erection of a replacement. Before his death, Szepessy saw the completion of the present structure, along with a parish hall that became a community center for the neighborhood's Hungarians.

The building has been well maintained, due partially to funds from generous bequests, but membership has fallen significantly from the parish's height. Most of the neighborhood's Hungarian residents left in the 1970s, due largely to disappearing factory jobs and rapidly rising crime rates.

Oliver Hazard Payne Estate is a historic estate, also known as Omega and Wiltwick, located on the west bank of the Hudson River at Esopus in Ulster County, New York, United States. The estate features a Beaux Arts-style Mediterranean palazzo with an open courtyard. It was designed in 1905 for Col. Oliver Hazard Payne by the architect Thomas Hastings of the renowned firm of Carr√®re and Hastings, who also designed the New York Public Library and the Henry Clay Frick House. The estate is currently owned by Marist College and operated as the Raymond A. Rich Institute for Leadership Development. History of the estate Col. Oliver Hazard Payne (1839‚Äì1917) began construction on the mansion in 1909, and it was finished in 1911. The mansion was built on the same site as \\"Waldorf,\\" John Jacob Astor III‚Äôs (1822‚Äì1890) somewhat less grand Renaissance-style residence that was razed. Payne had served as a colonel in the American Civil War, during which time he was grievously wounded. He later became involved in oil refining and founded the company Clark, Payne & Co., which was purchased by John D. Rockefeller in 1872, at which point Payne became the treasurer of Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest men in America. As Payne never married nor had children, upon his death in 1917, the house passed to one of his nephews, Harry Payne Bingham (1887‚Äì1955). In 1933, Bingham donated the 484 acre estate to the Episcopal Diocese of New York, which established the Wiltwyck School for Boys, serving troubled children from 1937 until 1966. The school's leaders included Eleanor Roosevelt, and its alumni included boxing champion Floyd Patterson. In 1942, 60 acres of the estate, including the mansion, was purchased by the Marist Brothers, founders of Marist College, and it was used as a retreat for several years. In 1986, the estate was purchased from the Marist Brothers by Raymond A. Rich (1912‚Äì2009), a wealthy businessman and industrialist who served as CEO of U.S. Filters Corp. during the 1970s. Following the purchase, he restored the mansion to its former glory and resided there until his death in June 2009. In 2009, after the death of Rich, it was revealed that he had bequeathed the estate to Marist College, located on the east bank of the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie, New York. The estate was conservatively estimated to be worth $65 million at the time. Additionally, Rich set aside $10 million for the school to establish a leadership institute. This brings the estate full circle, following its prior ownership by the Marist Brothers. The estate has since been part of the Raymond A. Rich Leadership Institute at Marist, and the mansion is used for speakers, conferences and workshops by the school. Mansion The 1909 mansion, completed in 1911, is constructed of reinforced concrete and faced with Italian limestone topped by red tile clad hipped roofs. The eastern portico has six single-story Ionic columns set between rugged arched pavilions and is fronted by a balustraded terrace overlooking the river. At the palazzo's center is an enclosed courtyard fitted with a fountain and recessed loggias adorned with frescoes. Located nearby on the riverbank is a stone boat house that is part of the estate.

The band pulled out of the remaining shows in Bilbao and Barcelona, and canceled a UK- wide tour scheduled for March, as well as shows in Japan with 65daysofstatic later in the year. A 'Blakfish and Friends' farewell show took place on 19 March 2010 at The Flapper in Birmingham, with friends of the band filling in for Sam's vocals and guitars. Guest performers included Toby Hayes of Shoes And Socks Off and Meet Me In St. Louis (band), Steven Bachelor and Richard Buckley of Shapes, and members of Soni~Quella and The James Cleaver Quintet Jack Saunders (vox) Jimmy Diego (bass) Maud E Licious (guitar) Mackerel Skarrington (drums). Tickets for the event sold out on the first night they went on sale. Support came from Shapes, The James Cleaver Quintet and Conquistadors. Fifty screen prints of the poster for the show were made available, as was a re-issue of See You In Another City containing 9 additional tracks of b-sides and rarities. At the final show, Thom, Rich and Wiz debuted a track named \\"You're A Guy\\", the first public performance of their new material for a new three-piece band. After the band broke up, Thom, Rich and Wiz officially formed \\"&U;&I;\\" and released EP Kill the Man that Shot that Man on ondryland Records and LP Light Bearer the following year. Sam created two bands, one called \\"Vietwow!\\" with Toby Hayes (Meet Me In St. Louis, Shield Your Eyes, Shoes And Socks Off), Alex Wiezak (Youves) and Bob D'Mello (Super Tennis) and a 2-piece named \\"‚Ä†Hymns‚Ä†\\" with former SOS drummer Peter Reisner. ‚Ä†Hymns‚Ä† released their debut double album Cardinal Sins/Contrary Virtues in January 2012 on Big Scary Monsters . He also continues to work on his solo project \\"Greatest Hits\\". In 2010, Rob played drums on a project with On The Might Of Princes guitarist and singer, Jason Rosenthal. Following Rosenthal's death in August 2013, plans were made to finish and release the material. On 24 August 2012, marking three years to the day since the release of Champions, Leeds-based magazine Musical Mathematics celebrated the first ever Blakfish Day, encouraging fans to celebrate the band's music and career. This was also the first and last time that Blakfish's 2nd album demos were heard, via Musical Mathematics' website. Sam Manville reinvented himself as an electronic, house and garage producer under the pseudonym FTSE and has worked with M√ò, Shola Ama, Burnaboy and Peking Duk releasing on labels including Ministry of Sound and Rinse. In 2017 he started his own record label, Roller Blaster Records.

Some examples include:- *At shows they said that \\"Economics\\" was \\"about money, cos we've got none\\" *\\"Ringo Starr - 2nd Best Drummer In The Beatles\\" is about their disdain for the music industry and nightclubs *\\"Your Hair's Straight But Your Boyfriend Ain't\\" is about fashion - Sam Manville said \\"clothes are just there to keep you warm, people take it so seriously. I guess it's just another jibe at the British public.\\" *\\"I Saw A Car On Fire There Once\\" is about the band's hatred of driving through London *\\"Randy Sage - True American Hero\\" is about the band's struggle with officials at an American airport when trying to enter the country to record their album *\\"Preparing For Guests\\" is about the process of tidying the house for visitors, and how \\"it's like we're lying to all of our friends\\" *\\"Scotland's Worst Invention\\" is about dislike for television, and includes the line \\"What's with all these f***ing soaps, I want Ray Mears not Hollyoaks\\" This was not the only inspiration for songs though, some other song meanings include:- *\\"...Rollerskates\\" is about a friend of the band, whose girlfriend went travelling *\\"I'm Laughing Now...

The building, designed in the Georgian Revival style by the Cleveland-based architectural firm Hubbell & Benes, was constructed in 1927 followed by completion of the originally planned east wing in 1929. As the hospital grew, later additions were made in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. In May 1999, the hospital announced the closure of its Level 2 trauma center, and the hospital shut down the rest of its surgical and medical services later that summer. After the closure of the hospital in 1999, the building was vacant for over 10 years, falling into decay and becoming a major target for vandals. In 2005, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and the following year was purchased by Cleveland Neighborhood Progress with plans for residential redevelopment by 2008. The later additions from the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s were demolished in 2007 leaving the original , Georgian Revival building. Economic difficulties, however, prevented further work from beginning until 2011. The building was renovated and restored in three phases with the first two phases being an independent senior living and subsidized housing community called St. Luke's Manor. The central wing, with 72 apartments, was completed first in 2012, followed by an additional 65 apartments in the west wing in phase two. The east wing, which included the Prentiss Auditorium, was renovated in phase three, mainly for office use, and was mostly completed by late 2013 with the Prentiss Auditorium completed in late 2014 and dedicated in February 2015. Its anchor tenant is a charter school with approximately 250 students in grades K‚Äì8 along with a Boys & Girls Clubs of America location and offices for Cleveland Neighborhood Progress and the St. Luke's Foundation.

He was portrayed by Eric Sheffer Stevens and made his first appearance on January 19, 2010. Reid Oliver revealed himself to be gay on ATWT adding to a list of fictional characters on the show that have been connected to Luke and Noah, the first teen same-sex couple in American soap history. Character history=Luke Snyder Reid arrives in Oakdale against his wishes after being blackmailed by Luke Snyder (played by Van Hansis) into performing a surgery on his long-time boyfriend Noah Mayer (Jake Silbermann) to help him regain his sight. Upon discovering that Noah would require complex surgery, Reid decides to return to his practice in Dallas. After an accident involving Luke's car and that of the wife of Chief of Medical staff at Memorial Hospital, Reid is ordered by the court not to leave Oakdale and is put under the care of Bob Hughes, the Chief of staff. Reid Oliver is known for his arrogance, overconfidence and his witty one liners. (Though, in scenes with Luke, we learn that Reid is in fact quite vulnerable at times, feeling that Luke wants someone more like Noah, when Luke tries to help Reid improve his \\"people skills\\" to become Chief of Staff at Memorial Hospital after Bob Hughes steps down.) He quickly became good friends with Katie Peretti, moving in with her and her son, Jacob. Now that supercouple Luke and Noah have broken up, and Luke will be working with Reid on a new neuro wing at the hospital, it has given them a chance to talk to each other more. There has been clear connections between the two and all sources lead to the fact that Reid and Luke will end up a couple, despite never wanting to admit their attractions. On April 22, 2010, Reid and Luke shared their first kiss. They have had many starts and stops, and have kissed many times since the first. The first time they were about to have sex, Luke thought of Noah, who was in critical condition at the hospital and left. The second time Noah showed up at Luke's house, and they stopped. While meeting with a potential investor in the Oakdale Memorial at The Lake View, Noah punches Reid in the nose, which leads to Reid thinking he broke it. Earlier that day, Noah had told Reid they were finished as doctor and patient. Luke and Reid went to the hospital to check on his nose, all was fine. Luke and Reid started talking some more and kissed just as Bob Hughes walked in. Luke leaves the room and Bob asks Reid to tell him he didn't just see that. Bob tells Reid that he can either keep his career or have a relationship with Luke, considering it is unethical for the top neurosurgeon to be dating the hospital's biggest donor. Reid decides to keep his job, telling Luke that after a few months and Bob's retirement, they can start their relationship up again. Luke refuses to wait around and storms off. Reid realizes that he doesn't want to spend his life without Luke, so he resigns from the hospital. Luke and Reid begin their relationship but Reid is still angry with Bob for making him choose between his job and Luke. Chris Hughes' illness Bob decides against letting Invicta buy Memorial, and Reid gets his job back. Bob also informs Reid that he wants to nominate him as Chief of Staff. Bob's son, Chris Hughes, is furious upon hearing this news. He decides that he wants to be Chief of Staff as well and he and Reid begin to clash as they fight for the position. Chris is soon infected with a viral heart infection, which only Reid knows about after he walked in on Chris drawing his own blood. Reid begins to give Chris antibiotic injections but feels uncomfortable with Chris's deception and attempts to stop but Chris blackmails him. Reid tells Luke about Chris's condition and they both attempt to convince Chris to tell his family about his illness but he refuses. Reid calls a cardiologist, and former Oakdale resident, Dr. John Dixon to consult on Chris's illness. Chris continues to hide his illness from his family and refuses to cooperate with Dr. Dixon and Reid. After straining his heart while playing golf, Reid rushes Chris to the hospital and is finally forced to tell his family what is going on. Katie, who is dating Chris, is devastated. Reid tells her that if she can't handle it, go home - after Luke finally convinced her to come to the hospital. Luke follows Reid to Java where he gets upset with him for being so closed-hearted and confesses that he told Noah that he is in love with Reid. When Luke tells Reid he can say it back, Reid insists that Luke would think he was just saying it to make him happy. Dr. Dixon discovers that the damage to Chris' heart is irreversible and he will need a new heart. Chris' brother Tom starts to pull some strings to get Chris moved up on the transplant list. He finally manages to secure a heart in Bay City. However, another doctor at Bay City Hospital decides to keep the heart for one of his own patients. Determined not to let another \\"arrogant, self-proclaimed savior of man kind\\" take the heart that is rightfully Chris', Reid decides to go to Bay City himself to get the heart. Luke tries to talk him out of it, saying \\"I seem to remember another arrogant, self-proclaimed savior of man kind,\\" to which Reid says, \\"I wonder what happened to him?\\" Luke follows Reid to the parking lot where Reid confesses that he isn't just mad that another doctor is pulling rank, but that he really does care for the Hughes family and wants Chris to be okay. Luke wants to come with him but Reid tells him to stay. Just before he leaves, Reid stops and tells Luke that he loves him. Accident and death On his way to Bay City, he approaches a railroad crossing and starts across before the gates close to try to save time as a train approaches. His car stalls on the tracks and he can't start it again. He can't escape either as the seatbelt is stuck, and the train hits him. He doesn't die on impact but survives long enough to be at the hospital and say goodbye to Luke, give Luke \\"power of attorney\\" and tell a lawyer (Chris' brother) that his heart, if it is a match goes to Chris. Luke, of course, does not want to admit that Reid is dying, but after discussing it with Bob and after Reid's brain functions cease, with only the machines keeping him alive, he agrees. He talks to the lawyer and Bob saying \\"if it's what Reid wanted..\\" then he signs the paper giving his consent for Reid's heart to be transplanted to Chris. Right before they take Reid in for the transplant, Luke comes in and says his goodbyes. When the transplant is finished, he vows to Allison that he will not leave the hospital until he knows Chris will be okay. Holden and Lily by this time have heard about the accident, and Luke has finally returned home, after Chris woke up. They talk about funeral arrangements and discuss what to do with Reid's body. They have the funeral home director come over to talk, and he is a homophobe, so Lily immediately orders him to leave, after the director says they need to find his closest living relative before they can do anything, it is the law. Holden and Lily the commence a search for Reids uncle, whom they find, and he gives them his consent over \\"power of attorney.\\" He also gives them a chess piece, which was the one that he gave to Reid when he lost his first chess game, to give to Luke. Lily and Holden return home and they decide to have Reid cremated, putting half of his ashes into the cornerstone of the new neuro-wing, and half of them to the Snyder's farm, where Luke puts them into the lake after saying \\"and the other half I brought to the farm, so you'll always be with me.\\" See also *Luke Snyder External links * www.ericshefferstevens.nl *Getting to Know As the World Turns' Dr. Oliver *LukeAndReid.com, a Luke Snyder and Reid Oliver fan site * Category:As the World Turns characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional gay males Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional neurosurgeons Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Reid Oliver"},{"id":"26645651","text":"The former St. Paul's Episcopal Church is a historic church in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Built for an Episcopal parish by a well-known architect, it became a prominent component of the city's wealthy Millionaire's Row, due to its grand architecture. Although vacated by its original owners in the 1920s, it was soon bought by a Catholic monastic group that occupies it into the present day. It was named a historic site in 1980. St. Paul's Episcopal Church was founded in late 1846, and for two years the parishioners worshipped in a hotel before constructing a building at Fourth and Euclid downtown. A fire destroyed the structure before it was completed, but people throughout the city contributed funds to build a brick replacement in 1851. By the 1870s, the streets surrounding the church had become primarily commercial, so the vestry sold the building and rented halls while building the present church eastward on Euclid Avenue. Its placement amid the wealthy Millionaire's Row district soon caused it to become a symbol of the neighborhood. However, the membership gradually moved farther eastward, and in 1928 a new building was constructed in Cleveland Heights.\\"St. Paul's Episcopal Church\\", Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University, 1997-07-22.

Two years after the Episcopalians had moved eastward, they sought to sell the old building, and the Catholic diocese bought it for monastic use. A new Catholic parish, dedicated to St. Paul like the original occupants, was erected in 1949 to worship on the property; it remains to the present.Frame History, St. Paul Shrine, n.d.

At one time considered Cleveland's grandest and largest church, it is distinguished by the unusual architecture of the peak of the bell tower, and the open interior features extensive detailing,Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

Covered with sandstone from Berea, the building was a work of Gordon W. Lloyd, a Detroit architect who also produced grand churches in Ohio cities of various sizes, ranging from Trinity Episcopal Church in downtown Columbus to St. Paul's Episcopal Church in the smaller community of Medina. In 1980, St. Paul's was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of thirteen Lloyd-designed buildings, including ten churches, that are listed on the National Register.

They are a highly divergent class and are all characterized by an N-terminal Rho-related domain followed by at least one C-terminal BTB domain.  Discovery  The RhoBTB family of molecules was unknowingly discovered in 1993 by analyzing the Dictyostelium genome looking for members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. The authors began by doing Southern blots looking for cDNAs that cross- hybridize with a very conservative probe from hRas. They identified 19 new genes that belonged to the Ras superfamily and sequenced approximately 600 nucleotides from the start of the transcript. If they were looking for a normal Ras-like GTPase, this would have been sufficient. One of their clones, they called RacA, was more divergent than most of the others and the transcript didn‚Äôt terminate in a stop codon like the rest. The authors, however, didn‚Äôt comment on this and RhoBTB went undiscovered for another eight years. A very careful analysis by Francisco Rivero and coworkers ensued to find all of the Rho GTPases in Dictyostelium. During their endeavor, they found that the open reading frame of RacA was actually 400 amino acids longer than what Bush had published 8 years earlier. Instead of a 168 amino acid protein, RacA encoded a 598 residue protein with a Rho GTPase domain at the N-terminus and two BTB domains toward the C-terminus. BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-Brac) domains are known to involve hetero and homo associations with other BTB domain-containing proteins. Because this novel RhoBTB protein was in Dictostelium, the authors were curious if any homologous proteins exist in humans. They found three and called them RhoBTB1, RhoBTB2, and RhoBTB3.  Localization and expression  RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2 are much more homologous than RhoBTB3. Further analysis revealed that the intron-exon structure of RhoBTB1 and 2 are also quite similar and have only one common intron with RhoBTB3. RhoBTB1 and 2 were not detected during mouse development, but RhoBTB3 was detected strongly between embryonic days 11.5 through 17.5. Additionally, RhoBTB1 and 2 are localized to vesicular structures, while RhoBTB3 is localized to the trans-Golgi network.

It is part of the IBM WebSphere product suite. Current version is version 9.0. It consists of two independent products: * Caching proxy * Load balancer Edge Server comprises 4 basic components: * Load Balancer: Used to direct incoming requests to an appropriate server based on a set of rules which may include load balancing requests across several servers. Server selection is based upon health checks which includes the ability for the user to write specialized health check requests. The current level supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. * Caching Proxy: The caching proxy system can be configured as either a forward- or reverse-proxy server. Requested content is cached by Edge before being sent to the requestor and subsequent requests can, based on its internal algorithm that can be customized, be served from the cache instead of forwarding them to application server for reprocessing. This improves response time and minimizes network bandwidth use. A primary use of Edge server is therefore to increase the performance and scalabity of J2EE applications. * Content Distribution: This feature is used in conjunction with the load balancer, where multiple Edge server components are used, to distribute HTTP requests based on URL or other administrator configured characteristics, eliminating the need to store identical content on all Edge servers. * Application Service at the Edge: Ability to build a dynamic web page from fragments generated by multiple application servers Edge can be configured for high availability with a backup Edge failover server that takes over sessions if the primary Edge server fails.

Their award-winning productions were featured in the Wall Street Journal on February 25, 2010. Production Style FinalRune Productions uses field recording techniques for recording radio drama, a technique taught to director Fred Greenhalgh by his mentor, Roger Gregg (of Crazy Dog Audio Theatre). On location recording is more like film recording than traditional, studio-based radio drama. Actors, director, and sound recordist go to an acoustical environment similar to that referenced in the play, and record in stereo to a compact flash recording device. The result is a drama that has natural sound that is laborious and difficult to re-create in post-production. This process also greatly speeds up post-production. Company history FinalRune Productions began in 2006 with the production of the story Day of the Dead, by Fred Greenhalgh. Since then, FinalRune has released over a dozen other titles, mostly original work. In 2010, FinalRune released the pilot of an audio serialization of the novel Open Season by Archer Mayor . This pilot was produced on location and is an example of how dramatized treatments of novels different from a single-voiced audiobook.

The gothic style building was designed by architects Cudell & Richardson. The current church was built in 1875 and was added into the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History St. Stephen Roman Catholic Church was founded in 1869 due to a need for a second German parish on the west side of Cleveland. The first German parish, St. Mary's, increased so much that Cleveland was in need of a second parish for German-speaking Catholics. In April 1869 the first bishop of Cleveland, Bishop Louis Amadeus Rappe, appointed Fr. Stephen Falk to have a two-story building built. The building would be used as a church on the upper level and a school on the lower level to accommodate the 200 families from St. Mary's that lived west of 44th Street. The newly ordained Fr. Casimir Reichlin became the first pastor and said the first Mass of the parish on May 1, 1870. He served as pastor of St. Stephen's for 38 years. In 1873, Fr. Reichlin realized that a new church building was needed to accommodate the growing parish. The Cleveland-based architect firm called Cudell & Richardson was hired to build the structure that still stands today as St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church. Due to economic depression in the mid-1870s, work on the new building was stopped. Parishioners mortgaged their own properties to raise funds for the new church. It was dedicated on November 20, 1881 by the second bishop of Cleveland, Rev. Richard Gilmour. Volunteer German and Hungarian woodworkers completed the interior of the church. Over the next 40 years, the parish added a rectory, convent for the Sisters of Notre Dame and two school buildings including one for and an all girls two-year high school which opened in 1905. After World War II, St. Stephen's parish experienced unprecedented growth due to the population growth in Cleveland and throughout the country. On June 8, 1953 a tornado severely damaged the church structure. Work to restore the building began immediately. The church was reopened on November 6, 1953. In the late sixties, the parish enrollment was at a low due to migration of families to suburban towns. St. Stephen's parish graduated its last high school class in 1970 and the following school year moved the elementary level classes into the old high school building. In 1986, St. Stephen School combined with St. Michael and St. Boniface Schools and formed Metro Catholic School. St. Stephen's was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 11, 1977. In the 2010 round of parish closings in Cleveland, Ohio due to an unfortunate shortage of priests in the diocese, Bishop Richard Lennon spared St. Stephen's because of its historical significance. Architecture The church building is made entirely of stone, mainly Amherst stone, by Cudell & Richardson Architect firm. The church is 165 long and 74 feet wide. The architect style is Gothic and the shape of the church is cruciform. On each side of the main altar are six enormous wooden pillars that branch out into many columns. The high altar, side altars and pulpit are made entirely of oak wood and decorated with beautiful German woodcarvings. The church pews are also oak. A Mexican onyx and brass Communion rail was installed over the years and the floor of the sanctuary and aisles is made of black and white marble tiles. Contemporary life St. Stephen's is a fully active Roman Catholic Parish in the Diocese of Cleveland. This means that they have a full parish staff and church council. They have regular Sunday Masses as well as daily Masses. German Mass is offered every first Sunday at 11am. In addition to German and English Masses, St. Stephen's also offers Tridentine Latin Masses every Sunday at 9:30am as well as daily Tridentine Latin Masses at varying times. The Latin Mass celebrant at St. Stephen's is Rev. Fr. Bede Kotlinski, OSB. Other staff includes Pastor Rev. Caroli B. Shao and Permanent Deacon Rev. Mr. Moises Cruz. St. Stephen's hosts many church events and fund raisers as well as promotes those of other local parishes. St. Stephen's also promotes pro-life events as well as home school events. In keeping with its German tradition, one of the many cultural activities that is offered at St. Stephen's is a German summer camp. This summer camp allows children to be introduced to the German language in a fun setting through crafts, games, and scavenger hunts. The summer camp requires no prior knowledge of the German language. The parish observes ‚ÄúPriesthood Sunday‚Äù to celebrate the gift of the holy priesthood in the life of the Catholic Church and encourages parishioners to pray for and submit a thank you note for priests numerous priests.

It is the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Ohio. Building was begun in 1901 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History Trinity parish was founded on November 9, 1816 in the home of Phineas Shepherd. As the parish grew, a new wood-frame church was erected on the corner of St. Clair Avenue and Seneca Street (now West 3rd Street) and was consecrated in 1829. This was the first church building built within the village limits of Cleveland. In 1846, to meet the needs of a growing parish, plans for a larger, centralized building just east of Public Square commenced. The congregation moved into the larger stone structure in the Gothic style on Superior Avenue in 1855. In 1890, Trinity Church was offered to Bishop William A. Leonard for use as a cathedral for the Diocese of Ohio. The congregation would maintain the building and it would serve dual roles as the parish church and cathedral for the diocese. Shortly thereafter plans were developed to build a new cathedral in its present location. Charles F. Schweinfurth was selected as the architect for the new cathedral and had originally planned a Romanesque building. Bishop Leonard and the congregation strongly objected preferring a Gothic structure that was more befitting to Anglican traditions. Construction began on the cathedral in 1901 and it was officially consecrated on September 24, 1907. In 2002, Trinity Commons was completed which provided additional program and office space for the cathedral and diocese. Central to the Trinity Commons is a central piazza used for informal gatherings after services and serves as the entry space for the cathedral. In addition to meeting an office space, the Commons hosts and art gallery, coffee shop, and restaurant. Deans Charles D.

Formed in the 1840s, the congregation built the present building shortly after 1900, along with an adjacent church school. Both buildings have been named historic sites. The school is no longer open. Since approximately 1860, the stretch of Prospect Avenue where Zion Lutheran was built had been a primarily residential neighborhood.Cimperman, John, and Robert Keiser. '. National Park Service, 1984-06. It was one of the city's richer areas, as demonstrated by the grandness of churches such as Zion, First Methodist, Trinity Cathedral, and St. Paul's Episcopal Church on Euclid Avenue. This condition persisted into the mid-1910s, at which point the neighborhood transitioned into a largely commercial area. Beginning after 1930, the neighborhood deteriorated as many buildings were demolished, often to create room for parking lots. Front view of the school In such an environment Zion Lutheran Church was constructed in 1902 and opened for public use in the following year. It is home to a congregation founded by German immigrants in 1843, the oldest extant Lutheran congregation in the city; many other Cleveland-area Lutheran congregations, including Trinity Lutheran Church, are Zion's daughters. The original church building was located downtown, but the east-side German community was strong enough by 1902 that the congregation deemed Prospect Avenue a better location for serving the community. From its earliest years, the congregation had sponsored a school; Zion Lutheran School was founded in 1848, at which time all scholars were instructed in German. The school moved to Prospect Avenue ahead of the church; the present building was completed in 1903, two years after the completion of the auditorium and the opening of classes therein. William Dunn was the architect for the school,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1.

This was taken as a sign of slight for not recognising the Chola superiority and the King dispatched Karunakara Tondaiman to bring the Chalukya to his knees. Kulottunga Chola dispatched Karunakara Tondaiman to capture Anantavarman alive. Vikrama Chola, then a young prince then, was a part of the force under Karunakara Tondaiman.A comprehensive history of India, Volume 4, Part 1, By Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri, Indian History Congress.

He is most known for his photographic 'skull portraits' and also his meteorite and ‚ÄòLife Burger‚Äô sculptures. Set within the tradition of Vanitas, these works are designed as aids to spiritual and philosophical contemplation. He has referred to his art work as ‚Äúa way to give experience meaning in a tangible form; it is an exploration into the mysteries and sacredness of life and its presentation through art‚Äù.Turquoise Interconnections, 1998 Life De Cadenet was born and brought up in Chelsea, London and continues to live and work both in the UK and in Los Angeles, USA. He was educated at Ashfold Prep School and Harrow School, where he won the Lincoln-Seligmann Art Prize in 1992. In 1995, he curated Liberty a show of art by prisoners and special hospital patients, selected from the Koestler Awards Scheme, with the support of Chief Inspectorate of Prisons, Sir Stephen Tumim. In 1996 he graduated with a B.A. from the Courtauld Institute of Art. Between 1997 ‚Äì 2000, De Cadenet was the Arts Editor for Sleazenation magazine, a fashion and lifestyle magazine, featuring interviews with YBA artists including; Marc Quinn, Gavin Turk, Gilbert & George and Steven Willats. Since 2016, de Cadenet has been the contributing Arts Editor of Watkins Mind Body Spirit Magazine. His interviews include Eckhart Tolle, about the relationship of art and enlightenment, and David Lynch, on transcendental meditation and synchronicity amongst other subjects. In 2012, de Cadenet had a daughter, Ava de Cadenet with filmmaker Kirsten Lea. Career=Skull portraits De Cadenet launched his ‚Äòskull portrait‚Äô concept at The Mark, a warehouse space gallery the artist opened at 259 Kings Road London in 1996. It featured an x-ray of his own skull hanging from the ceiling. Between 1996 and 2016, de Cadenet presented a successive series of photographic 'skull portraits', based on X-rays of his subjects' skulls. In 1998, at aged 23, he presented Skullduggery, featuring skull portraits of fashion models on the exterior of the Victoria & Albert Museum. In 1999 he presented the complete Celebrity Series at an isolated location outside the Masai Mara in Kenya with the assistance of Cottars Safari. The show was attended by thousands of Masai tribe and some art collectors who flew to Kenya for the opening night. In 2003, at the age of 28, he was the youngest artist to present a solo show (British Spies) in both the university and museum buildings of the Courtauld Institute of Art in Sommerset house on the Strand, London.Installation view of Celebrity Skull Portraits at 30 Underwood Street Gallery, Shoreditch, London March 2000. The ongoing series of works explores the themes of human achievement and the sacredness of art in particular within the tradition of Vanitas.The ten feet high cibachrome photographic Celebrity Series was first presented in the UK in 2000 at 30 Underwood Street Gallery in Shoreditch, London. The artist has been sourcing the skull x-rays of significant subjects from history who are no longer living for incorporation into skull portraits. As of 2015, he has made portraits of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, Adolf Hitler, Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe. In 2016, the artist presented a skull portrait of Richard III in conjunction with Leicester University. Meteorite castings Meteorite Egg, 2017 Between 2008 and 2017 de Cadenet made a small series of castings in certified extra-terrestrial meteorite metal he purchased in Tucson, Arizona. The meteorite works include works that have overt religious symbolism including, The Origin, Hunger and Creation a series of different apples with one, two and three bites taken from them. A meteorite apple was sold at Philips Auctioneers in 2016 setting a record price for the artist's sculptures at auction. In 2017, he produced Meteorite Egg which is considered the largest casting made of meteorite metal ever made. Life Burgers In 2016, the artist launched his Life Burger sculptures in California which continued his preoccupation with human ambition, material success and mortality. The works received wide critical acclaim. In 2018, the Sunday Times reported the sale of the unique, 7 inch high, solid silver Trump Burger for ¬£30,000 to a UK collector. Awakened Artists Following his meeting with spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle in 2016, the artist founded the Awakened Artists group of artists which is an international community of artists whose work explores themes around evolving consciousness. In 2017 Awakened Artists co-produced Art Awakens Humanity, a conference at St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London, exploring the relationship between art and spirituality.  Editorial / Curatorial Projects / Poetry  He has had two books of poetry published, The Muse in 1999 and Afterbirth in 2015. Both publications explore his experience of the darker side of the female psyche. In 2016, Unicorn Publishing published Alexander de Cadenet a retrospective of the artists work by art-historian Edward Lucie-Smith.

The coastal lowland stretched from Kota Tua Jakarta to the west and Tanjung Priok to the east. Today, Ancol contains the main beach resort of Jakarta. Taman Impian Jaya Ancol, the largest integrated tourism area in South East Asia, is located in Ancol. Following the independence of Indonesia, Ancol was made one of the administrative village (kelurahan) of Pademangan Subdistrict in North Jakarta. The administrative village Ancol is bounded by Jakarta Bay to the north, Sunda Kelapa harbor to the west, and Kali Japat canal to the east. Government The Administrative Village of Ancol has a postal code of 14430. History=Pre-colonial period The name Ancol refers to a river located around 3 km east of Sunda Kelapa harbor, and the area surrounding it. The mouth of Ancol river was located where the area of Putri Duyung Cottage now located. The area surrounding Ancol river was a coastal lowland, characterized with brackish bodies of water, mangrove forests and swamps. The earliest mention of Ancol was in Koropak 406, a palm leaf manuscript written in the 16th century. It stated the attempt of the Sultanate of Banten, Cirebon, and Demak to siege Sunda Kelapa, and that the area of Ancol is considered one of the strategic place to attack the Sunda Kelapa harbor: :‚Ä¶Disilihan inya ku prebu Surawisesa, iny nu surup ka padaren, kasuran, kadiran, kuwamen. Prangrang lima welas kali hanteu eleh, ngalakukeun bala sariwu. Prangrang ka Kalapa deung Aaria burah. Prangrang ka Tanjung. Prangrang ka Ancol kiyi‚Ä¶. Arrival of the Europeans Coastal area of Batavia showing the River Ancol to the east (left of this image). Several villas were found along the Ancol Canal, which was built to connect the canals of Batavia to the River Ancol. When the Portuguese arrived in the late 16th century, the Hindu kingdom of Pakuan Pajajaran welcomed their arrival and hoped that the Portuguese would protect them from the attack by the Islamic Sultanate of Banten, Demak, and Cirebon. Despite their alliance, the three sultanates, under the leadership of Fatahillah, managed to defeat both the kingdom of Pakuan Pajajaran and the Portuguese by attacking the port from the east area, through the coastal area of Ancol. Sunda Kelapa was renamed into Jayakarta. The Slingerland, to the east bank of the Ancol River, was a popular beach resort of the 18th-century. Later in the 17th century, the ruler of Jayakarta was defeated by the Dutch. The town was completely eradicated and a new fortified city, Batavia, was developed on the east bank of the Ciliwung. To control the water of Batavia, a system of canals were constructed to connect the canals of Batavia with nearby river: the Angke and the Ancol. The canal which connects Batavia with Ancol was named Antjolschevaart (Dutch \\"Ancol Canal\\"), has been established by 1650. Several forts and batteries were established to protect these canals, such as the Sconce Zouteland (Dutch \\"saline water\\") guarding the point where Ancol Canal meet River Ancol, which would later be upgraded into Fort Ancol in the 18th- century. By the end of the 18th-century, two batteries guarded the mouth of River Ancol, Slingerland to the east, Zeelucht to the west. Resort houses, such as the house of Adriaan Valckenier, were built along the Ancol Canal as a beach resort. The coastal area to the east bank of Ancol River, named Slingerland or Sanggerlang (now Ancol residential area), was a popular destination for the elites. The Chinese temple Da Bo Gong, built in 1650, was among the first building constructed in Ancol. During the course of the 19th century, the old Batavia was gradually abandoned in favor of the much healthier and cleaner Weltevreden. During the period, Ancol remained undeveloped. With the construction of a new port in Tanjung Priok in late 19th-century, 200 years old Ancol Canal was extended to reach Tanjung Priok. A new railway line was established along the Ancol Canal, connecting Batavia N.I.S. station with Tanjung Priok station. Despite the introduction of these new infrastructure, the area of Ancol remained devoid of any urban development. World War II Ancol Cemetery was created to bury the executed people during the Japanese occupation. During the Japanese occupation, the swampy area of Ancol was used as places of execution and mass grave for those who opposed the Japanese troops, mainly the Dutch. These victims were later reburied in a new cemetery on the coast of Ancol, Ancol Cemetery, inaugurated on September 14, 1946. The cemetery, also known as the \\"cemetery of the executed\\", contains more than 2,000 victims of execution during the Japanese occupation, many of whom are unknown. Because of its close proximity to the coast, the cemetery is threatened by sea water flooding. Modern period In 1960, Ancol remained an undeveloped, mosquito-infested swamps and fish ponds. President Sukarno, known for initiating many monumental projects in Jakarta, would propose the idea of reclaiming the swamps and converting them into Jakarta's largest recreation and entertainment center. This idea was finally initiated in 1965, an idea which opposed the first idea of developing Ancol into an industrial area. The development was started during the governancy of Ali Sadikin, the governor of Jakarta in 1966. The entertainment complex was named Taman Impian Jaya Ancol. The first facility was the Bina Ria Ancol beach, best known for its drive-in theater especially during the 1970s. The Dunia Fantasi theme park was built in 1984. Today, the 552 hectare recreation area is known as the Ancol Jakarta Bay City, contains hotels, cottages, beaches, a theme park, traditional market places, an oceanarium, a golf field and marina.

The book is arranged chronologically, with songs arranged according to the album on which they appeared. Each album forms a chapter, and is introduced by a commentary by Rick Poynor, these commentaries largely formed through interviews with Eno. The commentaries cover Eno and Mills's influences, working methods, biography and philosophies, and are illustrated with excerpts from Eno's working notebooks. The chapters ‚Äì and the albums which they precede ‚Äì are: The Prepared Observer (Here Come the Warm Jets); The Painted Score (Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)); The Dynamics of the System (Another Green World); The Hidden Intention (Before and After Science); and The Words I Receive (this last chapter accompanies various collaborative songs). The book was published by Faber and Faber, London, in association with Opal Records Ltd.. It was issued concurrently with the compilation album More Blank Than Frank/Desert Island Selection.

Early life and education Stafford is of European parentage and was born in Vienna, Austria. Her family immigrated to the United States when she was seven, first living in Ft. Monroe, Virginia. However, her American stepfather's job as a military attach√© caused the family to move every few years to postings in cities including Leghorn and Rome, Italy; Yokohama, Japan; Kilene, Texas; and Ft. Knox, Kentucky. Stafford received her BA from Northwestern University, where she majored in continental philosophy and comparative literature. She spent a year at the Sorbonne in Paris studying with Jean Wahl, Philippe Souriau, and Charles D√©d√©yan. She returned to Northwestern to study art history and got her MA She went on to the University of Chicago for doctoral studies, and during this period won a fellowship from the American Association of University Women that enabled her to study at the Warburg Institute in London, where she met art historian Ernst Gombrich, who became her thesis adviser. Career Stafford began her teaching career as an assistant professor at the National College of Education in 1969. In 1972 she moved on to Loyola University Chicago, and a year later to the University of Delaware, where she remained for nearly a decade. From 1981 to 2010, she was a full professor at the University of Chicago, where she was the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor until 2010. She is now Emerita at the University of Chicago and has been teaching at the Georgia Institute of Technology since 2010 as Distinguished University Visiting Professor. Stafford's books closely examine modes and technologies of visual presentation from the early modern period up to today's digital media. She works at the intersection of the imaging arts, the optical sciences, and performance technologies, with a strong interest in how experience is embodied. Her recent essays examine the revolutionary ways in which the brain sciences are changing our view of the total sensorium and inflecting our fundamental assumptions concerning perception, sensation, emotion, mental imagery, and subjectivity. Stafford's views have found an application in criticism of early mass media and multiple viewpoints, what she describes as, \\"cross-referencing material bits of distant reality\\". Stafford co-curated an influential exhibition at the J. Paul Getty Museum in 2001-02, \\"Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to Images on a Screen.\\" The exhibition catalog of the same title won the Katharine Kyes Leab & Daniel J. Leab American Book Prizes Current Exhibition Award in 2003. Stafford holds honorary degrees from Maryland Institute College of Art (1996), Grand Valley State University, Michigan (1996), and University of Warwick, England (1998). In addition to National Endowment for the Humanities and Guggenheim fellowships, she has won a number of prestigious awards for her research and books, including the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies Clifford Prize (1980), the College Art Association's Millard Meiss Publication Award (1979), the Gottschalk Prize for the best book on an eighteenth-century topic published during the preceding year, for Body Criticism (1992), the Michelle Kendrick Memorial Book Prize of the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts for Echo Objects: the Cognitive Work of Images (2007), and the Thomas N.

H. Quaytman (born 1961) is an American contemporary artist, best known for paintings on wood panels, using abstract and photographic elements in site- specific \\"Chapters\\", now numbering thirty-four. Each chapter is guided by architectural, historical and social characteristics of the original site. Since 2008, her work has been collected by a number of modern art museums. She is also an educator and author based in Connecticut. Early life and education Rebecca Howe Quaytman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1961. Her mother is the noted American postmodern poet Susan Howe, and her father was abstract painter Harvey Quaytman, well known for geometric works, with over 60 one-person exhibits. Her parents met while studying painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The family moved to the SoHo neighborhood of New York City in 1963. When Quaytman was 4, her mother began living with and later married David von Schlegell, an abstract artist and sculptor who became the director of graduate studies in sculpture at Yale University. Quaytman credits both her father and step-father with greatly influencing her development as an artist. Quaytman was an Artist in Residence at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 1982, and received a BA from Bard College in 1983. Her half-brother is writer Mark von Schlegell. Career In 1987 she was hired by PS1, later becoming Program Coordinator for three years. While there, she organized the first US solo exhibition dedicated to pioneering Swedish abstract painter Hilma af Klint, in 1989. She later worked as an assistant to artist Dan Graham. In 1991, she was awarded the Rome Prize allowing a full year of dedicated work. Additionally she studied for one year at the National College of Art & Design in Dublin, Ireland, and later the attended Institut des Hautes √âtudes en Arts Plastiques in Paris to study with Daniel Buren and Pontus Hult√©n. In 2005, Quaytman was a founding member and the Director of a cooperative gallery in Manhattan's Lower East Side called Orchard, run by twelve partners, including artists, filmmakers, art historians and curators. Since 2006 she has been on the faculty of Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, teaching painting in the Masters of Fine Arts program, and is frequently a visiting artist, scholar or lecturer at other colleges and museums. After winning the 1992 Rome Prize, in that year of uninterrupted time to pursue artistic development, Quaytman began to make a series of paintings which belonged together, which she described as \\"sentences.\\" She cites her epiphany as \\"The stance of the painting is the profile\\", after which she thought of her paintings in the context of the audience walking by, grouped together and observed with peripheral vision. After working as an assistant to Dan Graham, who had been experimenting with time-delay video installations, she began to use photographic images in her work, which she applies with silkscreening. A silkscreen of Graham himself would later be featured in her work. She found the use of silkscreening to be liberating, and cites influence from Rauschenberg, Warhol, Polke and Richter. In 2001, she was invited to participate in a show at the Queens Museum of Art, for which she made 40 paintings, in recognition of her 40th birthday, plus another 40 for a local gallery. The 80 paintings were all linked conceptually, and formed the first \\"chapter\\": \\"The Sun, Chapter 1\\". In the exhibit, she references the death of her grandfather and great-grandfather, by train crash near the location in Queens, building on a newspaper article clipped from the New York Sun. Each subsequent chapter reflects and adapts elements of the venue in which they are initially shown. For \\"Lodz Poem, Chapter 2\\", at the Lodz Poland Biennial, she focused on two early Polish modernists, Katarzyna Kobro and Wladyslaw Strzeminski, interweaving caption paintings and drawings from the World War II-era artists. In 2008, she was selected for a solo show at the Miguel Abreu Gallery in New York, and a two-person show with artist Josef Strau, at Vilma Gold in London, for which she created \\"iamb, Chapter 12\\". This collection related to the use of light by Strau (actual lamps), and illustration, based on an image from Milton's Paradise Lost, illustrated by John Martin, a 19th- century English artist. The show was well received by critics, including Frieze Magazine and The Brooklyn Rail, noting \\"Quaytman makes reference in the title to both the seat of seeing (i am), and the classical meter of poetry\\", and \\"Quaytman's sophisticated dissection of the complexities of seeing and the manifold aspects that inform perception is evident not only in individual works, but also in the relationship between specific works installed in the exhibition, and in the cumulative effect of the whole,\\" and The New York Times \\"The paintings in R. H. Quaytman's exhibition are cerebral, physically thought out and resolutely optical. They engage painting on every level in a restrained way; they also engage one another.\\" Distracting Distance, Chapter 16 Quaytman was selected for the 2010 Whitney Biennial. She was offered a north-facing room featuring a trapezoidal window designed by Marcel Breuer. For the show, she created \\"Distracting Distance, Chapter 16\\", which reflects on the shape of the window and its reference to perspective, as well as on a famous painting in the Whitney ‚Äì \\"A Woman in the Sun\\", by Edward Hopper, painted in 1961, the year of her birth. Photos of the entire room were published by Contemporary Art Daily. Later in 2010, for the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York, she created a retrospective exhibition \\"Spine, Chapter 20\\", of new pieces. Unlike all previous Chapters, this exhibit did not incorporate the specifics of the venue, instead reflecting upon all of her work to date. Together the Chapters form a figurative book ‚Äì an overarching structure for all the paintings. \\"The installation itself has a 'spine': an 80-foot wall extending from one corner of the room, on which most of the roughly 30 paintings are hung, creating a sense of space ‚Äì even emptiness, if you turn your attention toward the walls where paintings are customarily hung in the Neuberger.\\" according to The New York Times critic Martha Schwendener. Pieces in this chapter pull elements from all her previous chapters, such as \\"Distracting Distance / Hardy\\", in which a nude woman stands in front of the Marcel Breuer window at the Whitney. \\"Spine, Chapter 20\\" also provided the final chapter of an impressive physical book ‚Äì the retrospective she published in 2011, Spine, with 380 color illustrations. In 2011, her painting was on the cover of Artforum magazine, with an essay by Paul Galvez describing her international \\"triumvirate of installations\\" in the past three years. In 2014, her work was included in the Athens component of documenta 14. Her first major museum survey, Morning: Chapter 30, was organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, (MOCA) in 2016. In 2018, she created + x, Chapter 34, a body of work derived from the notebooks of Hilma af Klint and presented alongside the Guggenheim's major retrospective of that artist.

Bulger was led away from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle as his mother had taken her eyes off him momentarily. His mutilated body was found on a railway line away in Walton, Liverpool, two days after his abduction. Thompson and Venables were charged on 20 February 1993 with Bulger's abduction and murder. They were found guilty on 24 November 1993, making them the youngest convicted murderers in modern British history. They were sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's pleasure until a Parole Board decision in June 2001 recommended their release on a lifelong licence aged 18. In 2010, Venables was sent to prison for breaching the terms of his licence, and was released on parole again in 2013. In November 2017, Venables was again sent to prison for possessing child abuse images on his computer. The Bulger case has prompted widespread debate on the issue of how to handle young offenders when they are sentenced or released from custody. Murder Closed-circuit television (CCTV) evidence from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle taken on Friday, 12 February 1993, showed Thompson and Venables casually observing children, apparently selecting a target. The boys were playing truant from school, which they did regularly. (Subscription Required) Throughout the day, Thompson and Venables were seen stealing various items including sweets, a troll doll, some batteries and a can of blue paint, some of which were later found at the murder scene. One of the boys later revealed that they were planning to find a child to abduct, lead him to the busy road alongside the shopping centre, and push him into the path of oncoming traffic. That same afternoon, Bulger, from nearby Kirkby, went with his mother, Denise, to the New Strand Shopping Centre. Whilst inside the A. R. Tym's butcher's shop on the lower floor of the centre at around 15:40, Denise, who had been temporarily distracted, realised that her son had disappeared. Thompson and Venables approached James Bulger, took him by the hand and led him out of the shopping centre. The moment was caught on CCTV at 15:42.CCTV: Does it work? BBC News, 13 August 2002. Bulger was taken to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, around a quarter of a mile from the New Strand Shopping Centre, where he was dropped on his head and suffered injuries to his face. The boys joked about pushing Bulger into the canal. An eyewitness during the trial said that when he saw Bulger at the canal, he was \\"crying his eyes out\\". During a walk across Liverpool, the boys were seen by 38 people, but most bystanders did nothing to intervene. Two people challenged Thompson and Venables, but they claimed Bulger was their younger brother or that he was lost and they were taking him to the local police station. At one point, the boys took Bulger into a pet shop, from which they were ejected. Eventually, the boys arrived in the village of Walton, and with Walton Lane police station across the road facing them, they hesitated and led Bulger up a steep bank to a railway line near the disused Walton & Anfield railway station, close to Anfield Cemetery, where they began torturing him. James Bulger being abducted by Thompson (above Bulger) and Venables (holding Bulger's hand) in an image recorded on shopping centre CCTV One of the boys threw blue Humbrol modelling paint, which they had shoplifted earlier, into Bulger's left eye. They kicked him, stamped on him and threw bricks and stones at him. Batteries were placed in Bulger's mouth and, according to police, some batteries may have been inserted into his anus, although none were found there. Finally, the boys dropped a iron bar, described in court as a railway fishplate, on Bulger. He sustained 10 skull fractures as a result of the bar striking his head. Alan Williams, the case's pathologist, stated that Bulger suffered so many injuries‚Äî42 in total‚Äîthat none could be isolated as the fatal blow. Thompson and Venables laid Bulger across the railway tracks and weighted his head down with rubble, in the hope that a train would hit him and make his death appear to be an accident. After they left the scene, his body was cut in half by a train. Bulger's severed body was discovered two days later on 14 February. A forensic pathologist testified that he had died before he was struck by the train. Police suspected that there was a sexual element to the crime, since Bulger's shoes, socks, trousers and underpants had been removed. The pathologist's report, which was read out in court, found that Bulger's foreskin had been forcibly pulled back. When Thompson and Venables were questioned about this aspect of the attack by detectives and a child psychiatrist, Eileen Vizard, the pair were reluctant to give details and also denied inserting some of the batteries into Bulger's anus. At his eventual parole, Venables's psychiatrist, Susan Bailey, reported that \\"visiting and revisiting the issue with Jon as a child, and now as an adolescent, he gives no account of any sexual element to the offence.\\" The police quickly found low-resolution video images of Bulger's abduction from the New Strand Shopping Centre by two unidentified boys. The railway embankment upon which his body had been discovered was adorned with hundreds of bunches of flowers. The family of one boy, who was detained for questioning but subsequently released, had to flee the city due to threats by vigilantes. The breakthrough came when a woman, on seeing slightly enhanced images of the two boys on national television, recognised Venables, whom she knew had played truant with Thompson that day. She contacted police and the boys were arrested. Legal proceedings=Arrest The fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to investigating officers, headed by Detective Superintendent Albert Kirby, of Merseyside Police. Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with \\"two youths\\" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV. Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body. Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through DNA tests. A pattern of bruising on Bulger's right cheek matched the features of the upper part of a shoe worn by Thompson; a paint mark in the toecap of one of Venables's shoes indicated he must have used \\"some force\\" when he kicked Bulger. Thompson is said to have asked police whether the two-year-old had been taken to hospital to \\"get him alive again\\". Mug shots of Venables and Thompson taken at the time of their arrest The boys were each charged with the murder of James Bulger on 20 February 1993, and appeared at South Sefton Youth Court on 22 February 1993, where they were remanded in custody to await trial. In the aftermath of their arrest, and throughout the media accounts of their trial, the boys were referred to as 'Child A' (Thompson) and 'Child B' (Venables). Awaiting trial, they were held in the secure units where they would eventually be sentenced to be detained indefinitely. Trial Up to five hundred protesters gathered at South Sefton Magistrates' Court during the boys' initial court appearances. The parents of the accused were moved to different parts of the country and assumed new identities following death threats from vigilantes. The full trial opened at Preston Crown Court on 1 November 1993, conducted as an adult trial with the accused in the dock away from their parents, and the judge and court officials in legal regalia. The boys denied the charges of murder, abduction and attempted abduction. The attempted abduction charge related to an incident at the New Strand Shopping Centre earlier on 12 February 1993, the day of Bulger's death. Thompson and Venables had attempted to lead away another two-year-old boy, but had been prevented by the boy's mother. Each boy sat in view of the court on raised chairs (so they could see out of the dock designed for adults) accompanied by two social workers. Although they were separated from their parents, they were within touching distance when their families attended the trial. News stories reported the demeanour of the defendants. These aspects were later criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 1999 that they had not received a fair trial by being tried in public in an adult court. At the trial, the lead prosecution counsel Richard Henriques QC successfully rebutted the principle of doli incapax, which presumes that young children cannot be held legally responsible for their actions. Thompson and Venables were considered by the court to be capable of \\"mischievous discretion\\", meaning an ability to act with criminal intent as they were mature enough to understand that they were doing something seriously wrong. A child psychiatrist, Eileen Vizard, who interviewed Thompson before the trial, was asked in court whether he would know the difference between right and wrong, that it was wrong to take a young child away from his mother, and that it was wrong to cause injury to a child. Vizard replied, \\"If the issue is on the balance of probabilities, I think I can answer with certainty.\\" Vizard also said that Thompson was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack on Bulger. Susan Bailey, the Home Office forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Venables, said unequivocally that he knew the difference between right and wrong. Thompson and Venables did not speak during the trial, and the case against them was based to a large extent on the more than 20 hours of tape-recorded police interviews with the boys, which were played back in court. Thompson was considered to have taken the leading role in the abduction process, though it was Venables who had apparently initiated the idea of taking Bulger to the railway line. Venables later described how Bulger seemed to like him, holding his hand and allowing him to pick him up on the meandering journey to the scene of his murder. Laurence Lee, who was the solicitor of Venables during the trial, later said that Thompson was one of the most frightening children he had seen, and compared him to the Pied Piper. After his appearances in court, Venables would strip off his clothes, saying \\"I can smell James like a baby smell.\\" The prosecution admitted a number of exhibits during the trial, including a box of 27 bricks, a blood-stained stone, Bulger's underpants, and the rusty iron bar described as a railway fishplate. The pathologist spent 33 minutes outlining the injuries sustained by Bulger; many of those to his legs had been inflicted after he was stripped from the waist down. Brain damage was extensive and included a haemorrhage. The boys, by then aged 11, were found guilty of Bulger's murder at the Preston court on 24 November 1993, becoming the youngest convicted murderers of the 20th century.James Bulger case: timeline of key quotations Daily Telegraph 4 March 2010 The judge, Mr Justice Morland, told Thompson and Venables that they had committed a crime of \\"unparalleled evil and barbarity... In my judgment, your conduct was both cunning and very wicked.\\" Morland sentenced them to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, with a recommendation that they should be kept in custody for \\"very, very many years to come\\", recommending a minimum term of eight years. At the close of the trial, the judge lifted reporting restrictions and allowed the names of the killers to be released, saying \\"I did this because the public interest overrode the interest of the defendants... There was a need for an informed public debate on crimes committed by young children.\\" Sir David Omand later criticised this decision and outlined the difficulties created by it in his 2010 review of the probation service's handling of the case. Post-trial Shortly after the trial, and after the judge had recommended a minimum sentence of eight years, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, recommended that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years, which would have made them eligible for release in February 2003 at the age of 20. The editors of the Sun newspaper handed a petition bearing nearly 280,000 signatures to Home Secretary Michael Howard, in a bid to increase the time spent by both boys in custody.James Bulger killing: the case history of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson The Guardian 3 March 2010. This campaign was successful, and in July 1994, Howard announced that the boys would be kept in custody for a minimum of fifteen years, meaning that they would not be considered for release until February 2008, by which time they would be 25 years old. Lord Donaldson criticised Howard's intervention, describing the increased tariff as \\"institutionalised vengeance ... [by] a politician playing to the gallery.\\" The increased minimum term was overturned in 1997 by the House of Lords that ruled it \\"unlawful\\" for the Home Secretary to decide on minimum sentences for young offenders. The High Court and European Court of Human Rights have since ruled that, though the parliament may set minimum and maximum terms for individual categories of crime, it is the responsibility of the trial judge, with the benefit of all the evidence and argument from both prosecution and defence counsel, to determine the minimum term in individual criminal cases. Tony Blair, then Shadow Home Secretary, gave a speech in Wellingborough during which he said: \\"We hear of crimes so horrific they provoke anger and disbelief in equal proportions... These are the ugly manifestations of a society that is becoming unworthy of that name.\\" Prime Minister John Major said that \\"society needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less.\\" The trial judge Mr. Justice Morland stated that exposure to violent videos might have encouraged the actions of Thompson and Venables, but this was disputed by David Maclean, the Minister of State at the Home Office at the time, who pointed out that police had found no evidence linking the case with \\"video nasties\\".Video link to Bulger murder disputed The Independent, 26 November 1993. Some British tabloid newspapers claimed that the attack on Bulger was inspired by the film Child's Play 3, and campaigned for the rules on \\"video nasties\\" to be tightened.Life after James The Guardian 6 February 2003. During the police investigation, it emerged that Child's Play 3 was one of the films that Jon Venables' father had rented in the months prior to the killing, but it was not established that Venables had ever watched it. One scene in the film shows the malevolent doll Chucky being splashed with blue paint during a paintball game. A Merseyside detective said, \\"We went through something like 200 titles rented by the Venables family. There were some you or I wouldn't want to see, but nothing‚Äîno scene, or plot, or dialogue‚Äîwhere you could put your finger on the freeze button and say that influenced a boy to go out and commit murder.\\" Inspector Ray Simpson of Merseyside Police commented: \\"If you are going to link this murder to a film, you might as well link it to The Railway Children\\".\\"Demon ears\\" , The Guardian, 21 March 1999. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 clarified the rules on the availability of certain types of video material to children. Detention After the trial, Thompson was held at the Barton Moss Secure Care Centre in Manchester. Venables was detained in Vardy House, a small eight-bedded unit at Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens on Merseyside. These locations were not publicly known until after the boys' release. Details of the boys' lives were recorded twice daily on running sheets and signed by the member of staff who had written them. The records were stored at the units and copied to officials in Whitehall. The boys were taught to conceal their real names and the crime they had committed which resulted in their being in the units. Venables' parents regularly visited their son at Red Bank, just as Thompson's mother did, every three days, at Barton Moss. The boys received education and rehabilitation; despite initial problems, Venables was said to have eventually made good progress at Red Bank, resulting in him being kept there for the full eight years, despite the facility only being a short-stay remand unit. Both boys, however, were reported to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, and Venables in particular told of experiencing nightmares and flashbacks of the murder. Appeal and release In 1999, lawyers for Thompson and Venables appealed to the European Court of Human Rights that the boys' trial had not been impartial, since they were too young to follow proceedings and understand an adult court. The European Court dismissed their claim that the trial was inhuman and degrading treatment, but upheld their claim they were denied a fair hearing by the nature of the court proceedings.BBC News 16 December 1999 . In a report dated 7 March 2010 , the Daily Mirror incorrectly reported that the ECHR did affirm the claim of \\"inhuman and degrading treatment\\" The European Court also held that Michael Howard's intervention had led to a \\"highly charged atmosphere\\", which resulted in an unfair judgment. On 15 March 1999, the court in Strasbourg ruled by 14 votes to five that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights regarding the fairness of the trial of Thompson and Venables, stating: \\"The public trial process in an adult court must be regarded in the case of an 11-year-old child as a severely intimidating procedure.\\" In September 1999, Bulger's parents appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but failed to persuade the court that a victim of a crime has the right to be involved in determining the sentence of the perpetrator. The European Court case led to the new Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, reviewing the minimum sentence. In October 2000, he recommended the tariff be reduced from ten to eight years, adding that young offender institutions were a \\"corrosive atmosphere\\" for the juveniles. In June 2001, after a six-month review, the parole board ruled the boys were no longer a threat to public safety and could be released as their minimum tariff had expired in February of that year. The Home Secretary David Blunkett approved the decision, and they were released a few weeks later on lifelong licence after serving eight years.Bulger statement in full at news.bbc.co.uk (accessed 23 April 2005)Bulger killers 'face danger' at news.bbc.co.uk (accessed 23 April 2005) Both men \\"were given new identities and moved to secret locations under a 'witness protection'-style programme.\\" This was supported by the fabrication of passports, national insurance numbers, qualification certificates and medical records. Blunkett added his own conditions to their licence and insisted on being sent daily updates on the men's actions. The terms of their release included the following: they were not allowed to contact each other or Bulger's family; they were prohibited from visiting the Merseyside region; curfews may be imposed on them and they must report to probation officers. If they breached the rules or were deemed a risk to the public, they could be returned to prison. An injunction was imposed on the media after the trial, preventing the publication of details about Thompson and Venables. The worldwide injunction was kept in force following their release on parole, so their new identities and locations could not be published.Young men, full of remorse , The Guardian, 27 October 2000 Blunkett stated in 2001: \\"The injunction was granted because there was a real and strong possibility that their lives would be at risk if their identities became known.\\" Subsequent events In the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down; they divorced in 1995. Denise married Stuart Fergus and they have two sons together. Ralph also remarried and has three daughters by his second wife. The Observer revealed that both Venables and Thompson had passed A-levels during their sentences. The paper also told how the Bulger family's lawyers had consulted psychiatric experts in order to present the parole panel with a report which suggested that Thompson is an undiagnosed psychopath, citing his lack of remorse during his trial and arrest. The report was ultimately dismissed. However, his lack of remorse at the time, in stark contrast to Venables, led to considerable scrutiny from the parole panel. Upon release, both Thompson and Venables had lost all trace of their Liverpool accents. In a psychiatric report prepared in 2000 before Venables' release, he was described as posing a \\"trivial\\" risk to the public and unlikely to reoffend. The chances of his successful rehabilitation were described as \\"very high\\". The Manchester Evening News published details that suggested the names of the secure institutions in which the pair were housed, in breach of the injunction against publicity which had been renewed early in 2001. In December that year, the paper was fined ¬£30,000 for contempt of court and ordered to pay costs of ¬£120,000. No significant publication or vigilante action against Thompson or Venables has occurred. Despite this, Bulger's mother, Denise, told how in 2004 she received a tip-off from an anonymous source that helped her locate Thompson. Upon seeing him, she was \\"paralysed with hatred\\" and was unable to confront him. In April 2007, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act confirmed that the Home Office had spent ¬£13,000 on an injunction to prevent a foreign magazine from revealing the new identities of Thompson and Venables. On 14 March 2008, an appeal to set up a Red Balloon Learner Centre in Merseyside in memory of James Bulger was launched by Denise Fergus, his mother, and Esther Rantzen. A memorial garden in Bulger's memory was created in Sacred Heart Primary School in his hometown of Kirkby, the school he would have been expected to attend had he not been murdered. In March 2010, a call was made by England's Children's commissioner Maggie Atkinson to raise the age of criminal responsibility from ten to twelve. She said that the killers of James Bulger should have undergone \\"programmes\\" to help turn their lives around, rather than being prosecuted. The Ministry of Justice rejected the call, saying that children over the age of ten knew the difference \\"between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing\\". In April 2010, a 19-year-old man from the Isle of Man was given a three-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming in a Facebook message that one of his former colleagues was Robert Thompson. In passing sentence, Deputy High Bailiff Alastair Montgomerie said that the teenager had \\"put that person at significant risk of serious harm\\" and in a \\"perilous position\\" by making the allegation. In March 2012, a 26-year-old man from Chorley, Lancashire was arrested after allegedly setting up a Facebook group with the title \\"What happened to Jamie Bulger was f**king hilarious.\\" The man's computer was seized for further investigations. On 25 February 2013, the Attorney General's Office announced that it was instituting contempt of court proceedings against several people who had allegedly published photographs online showing Thompson or Venables as adults. A spokesman commented \\"There are many different images circulating online claiming to be of Venables or Thompson; potentially innocent individuals may be wrongly identified as being one of the two men and placed in danger. The order, and its enforcement, is therefore intended to protect not only Venables and Thompson but also those members of the public who have been incorrectly identified as being one of the two men.\\" On 26 April 2013, two men received suspended jail sentences of nine months after admitting to contempt of court, by publishing photographs which they claimed to be of Venables and Thompson on Facebook and Twitter. The posts were seen by 24,000 people. According to BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman, the purpose of the prosecution was to ensure that the public was aware that Internet users were also subject to the law of contempt. On 27 November 2013, a man from Liverpool received a fourteen-month suspended prison sentence for posting images on Twitter claiming to show Venables. On 14 July 2016, a woman from Margate in Kent was jailed for three years after sending Twitter messages to Bulger's mother in which she posed as one of his killers and his ghost. The sentence was reduced to years on appeal. On 25 October 2016, a man was jailed for 26 weeks for stalking Denise Fergus. He had previously received a police warning for stalking her in 2008. On 31 January 2019, a man and a woman pleaded guilty to eight contempt of court offences at the High Court after they admitted posting photos on social media that they claimed identified Venables. Both received suspended prison sentences. On 13 March 2019, actress Tina Malone was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence for posting Venables' identity on Facebook. In January 2020, a 53-year-old woman from Ammanford received a prison sentence of eight months, suspended for 15 months. In November 2017, she had published an alleged photograph of Venables on Facebook with the advice \\"share this as much as possible.\\" Lord Justice Davis said that the offence was \\"close to the line\\" for an immediate prison sentence, but suspended the sentence after an early admission of guilt and remorse by the woman.  Later life of Jon Venables Relationships and other misdemeanours= Shortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was held. In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a Sunday Times Magazine article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a BBC documentary titled Jon Venables: What Went Wrong? The female staff member was accused of sexual misconduct and suspended; she never returned to work at Red Bank. A spokesman for St Helens Borough Council denied that the incident had been covered up, saying: \\"All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor.\\" Venables began living independently in March 2002. Some time thereafter, he began a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child. It is not known whether Venables had already begun downloading child pornography at the time of dating the woman, though he denies having ever met the child. In 2005, when Venables was 23, his probation officer met another girlfriend of his, who was aged 17. After a number of \\"young girlfriends\\", it was presumed that Venables was having a delayed adolescence. After a period of apparently reduced supervision, Venables began excessively drinking, taking drugs, downloading child pornography, as well as visiting Merseyside (a breach of his licence). In 2008, a new probation officer noted that he spent \\"a great deal of leisure time\\" playing video games and on the Internet. In September that year, Venables was arrested on suspicion of affray, following a fight outside a nightclub; he claimed he was acting in self-defence and the charges were later dropped after he agreed to go on an alcohol-awareness course. Three months later he was found to be in possession of cocaine; he was subjected to a curfew. On two separate occasions, Venables revealed his true identity to a friend. =2010 imprisonment = On 2 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice revealed that Jon Venables had been returned to prison for an unspecified violation of the terms of his licence of release. The Justice Secretary Jack Straw stated that Venables had been returned to prison because of \\"extremely serious allegations\\", and stated that he was \\"unable to give further details of the reasons for Jon Venables's return to custody, because it was not in the public interest to do so.\\" On 7 March, Venables was returned to prison accused of child pornography offences. In a statement to the House of Commons on 8 March 2010, Jack Straw reiterated that it was \\"not in the interest of justice\\" to reveal the reason why Venables had been returned to custody.Straw Will Not Reveal More On Bulger Killer Sky News 8 March 2010 Baroness Butler-Sloss, the judge who made the decision to grant Venables anonymity in 2001, warned that he could be killed if his new identity was revealed.Bulger killer Venables could be murdered, says ex-judge , BBC News, 8 March 2010. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, said that she was angry that the parole board did not tell her that Venables had been returned to prison, and called for his anonymity to be removed if he was charged with a crime. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice stated that there is a worldwide injunction against publication of either killer's location or new identity.Dodd, Vikram James Bulger killer back in prison , guardian.co.uk; retrieved 2 March 2010. Venables's return to prison revived a false claim that a man from Fleetwood, Lancashire was Jon Venables. The claim was reported and dismissed in September 2005, but reappeared in March 2010 when it was circulated widely via SMS messages and Facebook. Chief Inspector Tracie O'Gara of Lancashire Constabulary stated: \\"An individual who was targeted four-and-a-half years ago was not Jon Venables and now he has left the area.\\" On 21 June 2010, Venables was charged with possession and distribution of indecent images of children. It was alleged that he had downloaded 57 indecent images of children over a 12-month period to February 2010, and allowed other people to access the files through a peer- to-peer network. Venables faced two charges under the Protection of Children Act 1978. On 23 July 2010, Venables appeared at a court hearing at the Old Bailey via a video link, visible only to the judge hearing the case. He pleaded guilty to charges of downloading and distributing child pornography, and was given a sentence of two years' imprisonment. At the court hearing, it emerged that Venables had posed in online chat rooms as 35-year-old Dawn \\"Dawnie\\" Smith, a married woman from Liverpool who boasted about abusing her 8-year-old daughter, in the hope of obtaining further child pornography. Venables had contacted his probation officer in February 2010, fearing that his new identity had been compromised at his place of work. When the officer arrived at his flat, Venables was attempting to remove or destroy the hard drive of his computer with a knife and a tin opener. The officer's suspicions were aroused, and the computer was taken away for examination leading to the discovery of the child pornography, which included children as young as two being raped by adults and penetrative rape of seven- or eight-year-olds. The judge, Mr Justice Bean, ruled that Venables's new identity could not be revealed, but the media were allowed to report that he had been living in Cheshire at the time of his arrest. The High Court also heard that Venables had been arrested on suspicion of affray in September 2008, following a drunken street fight with another man. Later the same year, he was cautioned for possession of cocaine. In November 2010, a review of the National Probation Service handling of the case by Sir David Omand found that probation officers could not have prevented Venables from downloading child pornography. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, commented that only 24-hour surveillance would have prevented Venables from downloading the material. Venables was eligible for parole in July 2011. On 27 June 2011, the parole board decided that Venables would remain in custody, and that his parole would not be considered again for at least another year. =New identity = On 4 May 2011, it was reported that Venables would once again be given a new identity, following what was described as a \\"serious security breach\\" which revealed an identity that he had been using before his imprisonment in 2010. Details of the breach could not be reported for legal reasons. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice commented: \\"Such a change of identity is extremely rare and granted only when the police assess that there is clear and credible evidence of a sustained threat to the offender's life on release into the community.\\" The incident occurred after a man from Exeter posted photographs on a website devoted to identifying paedophiles, allegedly showing Venables as an adult and giving his name. =2013 parole hearing and release = In November 2011, it was reported that officials had decided that Venables would stay in prison for the foreseeable future, as he would be likely to reveal his true identity if released. A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the reports. On 4 July 2013, it was reported that the Parole Board for England and Wales had approved the release of Venables. On 3 September 2013, it was reported that Venables had been released from prison. =2017 imprisonment = On 23 November 2017, it was reported that Venables had again been recalled to prison for possession of child abuse imagery. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the reports. On 5 January 2018, Venables was charged with unspecified offences relating to indecent images of children. On 7 February 2018, Venables pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children for a second time. He pleaded guilty via video link to three charges of making indecent images of children and one of possessing a paedophile manual. He admitted being in possession of 392 category A, 148 category B, and 630 category C child pornography images, and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. In September 2020, he was denied parole. =2019 legal challenge to lift anonymity refused= On 4 March 2019, Bulger's father Ralph lost a legal challenge to lift the lifelong order protecting Venables' anonymity. Judge Sir Andrew McFarlane turned down the request, saying that the \\"uniquely notorious\\" nature of the case meant that \\"There is a strong possibility, if not a probability, that if his identity were known he would be pursued resulting in grave and possibly fatal consequences.\\" =Potential overseas resettlement = In late June 2019, it was reported that British officials had considered resettling Venables in either Canada, Australia or New Zealand due to the high costs behind protecting his anonymity. British authorities had reportedly spent ¬£65,000 in legal fees to keep Venables' identity a secret. In response to media coverage, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern remarked that Venables would need an exemption under the Immigration Act and that he should not \\"bother applying\\". In popular culture In June 2007, a computer game based on the television series Law & Order, titled Law & Order: Double or Nothing (made in 2003), was withdrawn from stores in the UK following reports that it contained an image of Bulger. The image in question is the CCTV frame of Bulger being led away by his killers, Thompson and Venables. The scene in the game involves a computer- generated detective pointing out the picture, which is meant to represent a fictional child abduction that the player is then asked to investigate. Bulger's family, along with many others, complained and the game was subsequently withdrawn by its UK distributor, GSP. The game's developer, Legacy Interactive, released a statement in which it apologised for the image's inclusion in the game; according to the statement, the image's use was \\"inadvertent\\" and took place \\"without any knowledge of the crime, which occurred in the UK and was minimally publicised in the United States\\". In 2008, Swedish playwright Niklas R√•dstr√∂m used the interview transcripts from interrogations with the murderers and their families to recreate the story. His play, Monsters, opened to mixed reviews at the Arcola Theatre in London in May 2009.McAlpine, Emma (15 May 2009) Review of Monsters at the Arcola Theatre In August 2009, Australia's Seven Network used real footage of the abduction to promote its crime drama City Homicide. The use of the footage was criticised by Bulger's mother, and Seven apologised. On 24 August 2009, co- hosts on Seven's breakfast show Sunrise asked whether the killers were now living in Australia, in an apparent tie-in with that week's episode of City Homicide. They answered the question the next day, relaying the Australian government's denial that the killers had been settled in the country. A storyline in Hollyoaks, set to begin in December 2009, was cancelled after the makers gave Bulger's mother Denise Fergus a special screening. The storyline was to feature Loretta Jones and her friend Chrissy, who had been given new identities before arriving in the village, after being convicted of murdering a child at the age of 12. The critical theorist Terry Eagleton introduced his 2010 book On Evil with the story of Bulger's murder. In January 2019, the short film Detainment was nominated for Best Live Action Short Film at the 91st Academy Awards. The film is based on transcripts of the police interviews with Thompson and Venables after their arrests. The nomination was criticised by Bulger's mother, who was not consulted before the film's release. Bulger's mother circulated a petition to have the film removed from the nominations. The film's director, Vincent Lambe, said that he would not be withdrawing the film, saying \\"it would defeat the purpose of making the film\\".

The second-oldest church building in Cuyahoga County, it has been a community landmark since the middle of the nineteenth century, and it was officially named a historic site in the late twentieth. North Olmsted's Universalists erected their church building in 1847, employing a Greek Revival design under the direction of John Ames. The building is a simple rectangle of frame;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 220. covered with weatherboarding, the walls rise to a gable with a bell tower atop the roofline at the front of the building. Four rectangular windows pierce the sides, while one such window sits on either side of the front, framing the main entrance. Above the entrance is a short ogive window, while the entirety of the gable is constructed as a pediment., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-12. The pediment is the building's most decorative portion, due to components such as it detailed fanlight. The church's current bell is more than 150 years old, having been installed in 1851. Overall, the building is a simple version of the Greek Revival style, although some Victorian details were added later, and the church has been moved from its original site. Members of the congregation have long been known for their liberal religious views; they appointed their first female preacher, Abbie Danforth, in 1878. Conversely, their architectural views are highly conservative; St. John's Episcopal Church, erected in 1838, is the county's only extant religious building that predates the North Olmsted Universalist Church. This lack of change was significant to the building's designation as a historic site. In November 1980, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in local history, even though neither churches nor moved buildings are generally considered eligible for addition to the Register. It is one of nine sites in and around North Olmstead and Olmsted Falls, along with John and Maria Adams House, Fort Hill, the Grand Pacific Hotel, the Samuel Lay House, the North Olmsted Town Hall, the Julia Carter Northrop House, the Olmsted Falls Depot, and the Olmsted Falls Historic District.

He was sponsored by BFGoodrich Tires. Vessels was a participant in the formation of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series in 1994. Frank earned the nickname \\"Scoop\\" from hanging around his grandfather's horse stalls as a kid. Off-road racing Vessels attained more than thirty off-road victories throughout his career, with at least one in every major off-road event. He was a four-time SCORE class champion. In 1974 Frank was named the \\"SCORE Rookie of the Year,\\" and the \\"Off-Roadsman of the Year\\" by SCORE International in 1978. One of his most important wins was at the 1977 Baja 1000. He won the event again in 1988. Sponsors BFGoodrich sponsored Vessels beginning in 1977, when it to help develop its new radial truck tires. He helped BFGoodrich develop other off- road tires such as the Radial T/A. With these new developments, off-road racing was able to move away from using tractor tires to using tires specifically designed for off-road racing. Vessels' 1977 truck The truck Vessels used for his 1977 win was a 1972 Ford F-100 built for him in 1976 by Bill Stroppe. The truck had a one-of-a-kind propane engine with an Impco fuel system.

Unlike regular decrees, which are used in Argentina for rulemaking, a DNU has the force of law. Once the President promulgates a DNU, it comes into force almost immediately; afterwards, the National Congress must examine the decree to determine whether it will be allowed to remain in force or not.Constituci√≥n Nacional . Senado.gov.ar. Retrieved on 2012-06-07.  Features  The Argentine National Congress must evaluate every Necessity and Urgency Decree. The possibility to promulgate DNUs is established in the article 99 of the Constitution of Argentina since 1994. As its name indicates, a Necessity and Urgency Decree is to be used only under exceptional situations, when it is not possible to follow the normal procedure to create laws in the Congress. In addition, the President cannot sanction DNUs legislating about criminal, tributary or electoral matters. As with regular decrees, Necessity and Urgency Decrees are promulgated by the President, but only with \\"General Agreement of Ministers\\" (Spanish: Acuerdo general de ministros). It means that all Ministers and the Chief of Staff must take part in the DNU's creation. Once the Necessity and Urgency Decree is sanctioned, the Chief of Staff must send the DNU to the Permanent Bicameral Committee of the Congress in no more than ten days. Then, the Bicameral Committee delivers its report to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Committee has also ten days to elaborate the report. During all this process, the DNU is completely in force.Regimen Legal De Los Decretos De Necesidad Y Urgencia, De Delegacion Legislativa Y De Promulgacion Parcial De Leyes . Infoleg.mecon.gov.ar. Retrieved on 2012-06-07. Each legislative chamber must deliver a resolution expressing its approval or rejection of the Necessity and Urgency Decree. If both chambers reject the DNU, it loses validity permanently. However, any rights acquired by people affected by the decree are not automatically terminated.  Background = In military governments  All legislation issued by military dictatorships in Argentina was made by the executive. These kinds of orders were known as decree-law (Spanish: decreto ley). Under the self-called Argentine Revolution and the National Reorganization Process (the two latest military governments), the decree-laws were known simply as laws. Because they were de facto governments, there was a legal controversy about the validity of decree-laws. In 1945, the Supreme Court of Argentina accepted them only if they were needed to fulfill the aims of the government. When the military government dissolved and civilian rule was reestablished, the decree-laws were no longer valid, unless the Congress ratified them.HISTORIA IDEOL√ìGICA DE LA CORTE SUPREMA DE JUSTICIA DE LA NACI√ìN 1947‚Äì1955 . Universidad del Salvador. IUSHISTORIA (Revista Electr√≥nica) N¬∫ 2. October 2005 In 1946, a new judgment by the Supreme Court established that decree-laws would remain valid after the end of the de facto government that promulgated them, and they could be abolished or modified in the same manner as other laws.  In constitutional governments  Although DNUs were introduced in their present form in the National Constitution in 1994, previous constitutional Presidents have used this type of decree. One example is the Austral Plan, which changed the national currency from the peso argentino to the Austral. This was sanctioned by the President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n in 1985, using the decree 1096/85.La necesidad de decretar la urgencia. politicargentina.com (2009-11-30) Currently, Argentina uses the peso as its national currency. In December 1990, the Supreme Court approved the sanction of Necessity and Urgency Decree in the so-called Peralta Case, in which Luis Peralta requested to declare unconstitutional the decree 36/90, that President Menem promulgated in 1990. The judges of the Court eventually confirmed the validity of the DNU.Caso Peralta. Todoiure.com.ar.

The local economy at the time was heavily dependent on nearby stone quarries, and the congregation was no different: when the quarries closed in 1905, the congregation was also disorganized. After twenty years of vacancy, the building became home to another Presbyterian congregation in 1925. Growth forced the building's replacement in the 1960s, and a new structure was finished on an adjacent property in 1963. Since that time, the old building has generally been used only for special events. The congregation remains an active part of the Western Reserve Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church (USA). In 1977, the old church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of five National Register-listed locations in Independence, along with the Fuller- Bramley House, the Packard-Doubler House, the South Park Site, and the William Tricker Inc.

Construction The folded cube graph of order k (containing 2k ‚àí 1 vertices) may be formed by adding edges between opposite pairs of vertices in a hypercube graph of order k ‚àí 1\\\\. (In a hypercube with 2n vertices, a pair of vertices are opposite if the shortest path between them has length n.) It can, equivalently, be formed from a hypercube graph (also) of order k, which has twice as many vertices, by identifying together (or contracting) every opposite pair of vertices. Properties An order-k folded cube graph is k-regular with 2k ‚àí 1 vertices and 2k ‚àí 2k edges. The chromatic number of the order-k folded cube graph is two when k is even (that is, in this case, the graph is bipartite) and four when k is odd. provides a proof, and credits the result to Naserasr and Tardif. The odd girth of a folded cube of odd order is k, so for odd k greater than three the folded cube graphs provide a class of triangle-free graphs with chromatic number four and arbitrarily large odd girth. As a distance-regular graph with odd girth k and diameter (k ‚àí 1)/2, the folded cubes of odd order are examples of generalized odd graphs.. When k is odd, the bipartite double cover of the order-k folded cube is the order-k cube from which it was formed. However, when k is even, the order-k cube is a double cover but not the bipartite double cover. In this case, the folded cube is itself already bipartite. Folded cube graphs inherit from their hypercube subgraphs the property of having a Hamiltonian cycle, and from the hypercubes that double cover them the property of being a distance- transitive graph.. When k is odd, the order-k folded cube contains as a subgraph a complete binary tree with 2k ‚àí 1 nodes. However, when k is even, this is not possible, because in this case the folded cube is a bipartite graph with equal numbers of vertices on each side of the bipartition, very different from the nearly two-to-one ratio for the bipartition of a complete binary tree.. Examples *The folded cube graph of order three is a complete graph K4. *The folded cube graph of order four is the complete bipartite graph K4,4. *The folded cube graph of order five is the Clebsch graph. *The folded cube graph of order six is the Kummer graph, i.e. the Levi graph of the Kummer point-plane configuration. Applications In parallel computing, folded cube graphs have been studied as a potential network topology, as an alternative to the hypercube. Compared to a hypercube, a folded cube with the same number of nodes has nearly the same vertex degree but only half the diameter. Efficient distributed algorithms (relative to those for a hypercube) are known for broadcasting information in a folded cube.; . See also *Halved cube graph NotesReferences *. *. *. *. *. *.

The sitter in this small work wears a wide, white hennin over a brown dress, which features a black-lined, v-shaped neckline. As is usual of van der Weyden's female portraits, her hands are clasped tightly in prayer, while her expression is generally humble. Unusually for a van der Weyden', she does not bow her head or gaze into the middle distance. Instead she looks directly at the viewer, creating an intimate relationship between sitter, viewer and artist,Campbell, 15 which art historian and research curator Lorne Campbell describes as \\"appealing and vibrant\\".Kemperdick, 22 The sitter has unusually bright, large and attractive blue eyes; their rendering may be considered outside of contemporary representation in that the artist did not reduce the size of the sitter's left eye to reflect the scale of her turn of head to the viewer's left. She is lit from a source above the canvas to the viewer's right, which sets up the falling light used to contrast the vivid white of her veil and flesh against the dark tones of her dress and volume of her head.Campbell, 53 The painting is composed through a mix of horizontal and vertical lines. The verticals of her head-dress blend into the lines of her shoulders and chest, while the horizontal folds of the veil are set against the line formed by her upper and lower lips. Given the individuality of her features, Rogier was obviously working from a life study of an actual person. Yet there are elements of abstraction in the image.Campbell, 11 The model is likely a member of the middle class, given her relatively plain dress, matronly features and accentuated breasts. It is widely believed that she was modeled on the artist's wife,Gr√∂ssinger, 60 Elisabeth Goffaert, though this has not been proven. The portrait is similar to other female portraits by Rogier and Robert Campin. In fact, the similarity between Rogier's and Campin's female portraits is so strong that they were sometimes mis- attributed.Campbell, 19 The portrait was held in the collection of a Princess Soltikoff in Saint Petersburg until acquired by the Berlin State Museums in 1908.

History The station, under the WTJS calls, was the first radio station in Jackson, Tennessee and the entire West Tennessee area excluding Memphis and was the beacon that made Jackson, Tennessee the center hub of what is called the Golden Circle Area. In the 1930s, people listened to WTJS for farm programming, live radio shows and the latest news updates. Being a wide- reaching advertising medium, WTJS enticed listeners from 22 counties to shop in Jackson, thus the genesis of the \\"Hub City.\\" WTJS was the starting point for many celebrities and newsmen who went on to larger markets. Eddie Arnold appeared on the station frequently early in his career as did Carl Perkins and game-show host Wink Martindale. Tom Butler was news director at WTJS before moving up to News Director with WPSD-TV in Paducah, Ky. John Dancy, born in Jackson, cut his teeth in news reporting on WTJS after graduating Union University. Mr. Dancy went on to become Washington, D.C. reporter for NBC. He now teaches at Duke University. Todd Starnes, also a Union University alum, was program direct at WTJS in the early 2000s and quickly moved up be a full- time reporter for FOX Radio and frequent feature contributor for FOX NEWS. Mike Slater's first radio job after graduating Yale was as morning show host on WTJS. During his tenure with WTJS, he became a frequent guest on Fox News, which provided greater nationwide exposure. He quickly moved up to a major market, San Diego, California, bypassing medium markets, which is an extremely rare occurrence.

The ship, named for the island of Sicily, was laid down in Venice in November 1884, launched in July 1891, and completed in May 1895. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of , though this high speed came at the cost of armor protection. Sicilia spent the first decade of her career in the Active Squadron of the Italian fleet. Thereafter, she was transferred to the Reserve Squadron, and by 1911, she was part of the Training Division. She took part in the Italo- Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912, where she escorted convoys to North Africa and supported Italian forces ashore by bombarding Ottoman troops. She was thereafter used as a depot ship for the new dreadnought battleship . During World War I, she continued in service as a depot ship, and later in the war she was converted into a repair ship. Sicilia was stricken in 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap. Design Line-drawing of the Re Umberto class Sicilia was long overall; she had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical compound steam engines each driving a single screw propeller, with steam supplied by eighteen coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube boilers. Her engines produced a top speed of at . Specific figures for her cruising radius have not survived, but the ships of her class could steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 736 officers and men.Gardiner, p. 342 Sicilia was armed with a main battery of four 30-caliber guns, mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one on either end of the ship. She carried a secondary battery of eight 40-cal. guns placed singly in shielded mounts atop the upper deck, with four on each broadside. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen guns in casemates in the upper deck, eight on each broadside. These were supported by twenty 43-cal. guns and ten guns. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she carried five torpedo tubes in above-water launchers. The ship was lightly armored for her size. She was protected by belt armor that was thick, an armored deck that was thick, and her conning tower was armored with of steel plate. The turrets had 4 in thick faces and the supporting barbettes had thick steel. Service history Sicilia steaming at full speed in her original configuration Sicilia was named after the island of Sicily. She was built by the Venetian Arsenal in Venice. Her keel was laid down on 3 November 1884, and her completed hull was launched on 6 July 1891. At her launching ceremony, the new ship was christened by Queen Margherita.Robinson, p. 182 Fitting-out work was completed on 4 May 1895, after which the ship entered service with the Italian fleet. In February 1897, Sicilia arrived off Crete to serve in the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Regia Marina, Imperial Russian Navy, and British Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897‚Äì1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Sicilia was the flagship of the 1st Division under Vice Admiral Felice Napoleone Canevaro, which also included her two sister ships, the protected cruisers and , and the torpedo cruiser .Robinson, p. 187 By 1899, Sicilia had been assigned to the 2nd Division.

The ships used their 6-inch guns to attack the fort to preserve their stock of 13.5-inch shells. By the morning of the 4th, the ships' gunfire had silenced the guns in the fort, allowing landing forces to go ashore and capture the city. These included a contingent led by Sicilias captain.Beehler, pp. 19‚Äì20 The ships of the Training Division thereafter alternated between Tripoli and Khoms to support the Italian garrisons in the two cities; this included repulsing a major Ottoman attack on Tripoli over 23‚Äì26 October, where Sicilia and Sardegna supported the Italian left flank against concerted Ottoman assaults.Beehler, pp. 34, 37 In November, Sicilia, Re Umberto, the torpedo cruiser Partenope, the destroyer , and the torpedo boat bombarded the oasis at Taguira, though no Turkish forces were present. The Italians then sent a garrison to protect the oasis.Beehler, p. 48 By December, the three ships were stationed in Tripoli, where they were replaced by the old ironclads and . Sicilia and her sisters arrived back in La Spezia, where they had their ammunition and supplies replenished.Beehler, p. 47 In May 1912, the Training Division patrolled the coast, but saw no action.Beehler, p. 77 The following month, Sicilia and her sisters, along with six torpedo boats, escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa, one of the last ports in Libya still under Ottoman control. The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing; after taking the city, the Italian forces then moved on to Misrata. Sicilia and the rest of the ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July.Beehler, p. 81 The Training Division then returned to Italy, where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August, this time to Zuara, the last port in Ottoman hands. The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later, which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south. With the capture of the city, Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast.Beehler, pp. 90‚Äì91 On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.Beehler, p. 95 Later career Sicilia became a depot ship for the new dreadnought battleship , which was then nearing completion at Taranto. Sicilia was stricken on 9 July 1914 and slated to be scrapped, but the Regia Marina decided to retain the ship after World War I broke out at the end of the month. On 16 August 1914, the ship was disarmed and returned to service as a depot ship in Taranto for ammunition and sailors. Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers.Halpern, p. 140 Later in the war, Sicilia was converted into a repair ship. The ship was stricken again in 1923 and thereafter broken up for scrap.Gardiner & Gray, p. 256 FootnotesReferences * * Brassey, Thomas A., ed. (1899). The Naval Annual (Portsmouth: J.

Since then, the word \\"Sugrivajne\\" has often been used in Indian politics denoting a Bill or Act that must be passed or obeyed in a timely fashion. In the Ramayana, Sugrivajne is found within the Yuddha KƒÅ·πá·∏ça. In this book, Hanuman introduces Lord Rama to his exiled King Sugriva, at Mount Rishyamukah. This exile has been brought about from a supposed betrayal by Sugriva against his elder brother Vali the king of Kishkindha, who now also holds his wife. Lord Rama is at this time on a quest to rescue his wife Sita from the demon Ravana, king of the Rakshasas. Sugriva shows Rama the items that Sita had dropped whilst she traveled overhead in the clutches of Ravana. Rama makes a suggestion to kill Vali and reinstate Sugriva as King if Sugriva, in turn, pledges to help Rama with his quest. Sugriva accepts & goes to challenge Vali. An evenly matched combat ensues between the brothers, and after some time Hanuman helps Rama kill Vali. Sugriva claims the kingdom, takes back his wife RumƒÅ, and Vali's widow Tara is made Empress. Sugriva dismisses his earlier promise to help Rama and is threatened with death but Hanuman and Tara persuade him otherwise and so Sugriva takes his army south to free Sita from Ravana. In the battle Sugriva challenges and fights with the Rakshasa Kumbhakarna, a brother of Ravana, and no doubt would have killed Surgriva but for the timely intervention of Rama's brother Lakshmana.

The Security Council welcomed the ceasefire between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Croats and the framework agreements between the two. It was important also that the Bosnian Serbs were involved in the negotiations. The ceasefire between Croatia and the local Serb authorities in the United Nations Protected Areas was welcomed as were the talks between Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Welcoming the progress in Sarajevo, the Council noted that a strong and visible presence of UNPROFOR was essential to consolidate such progress, though the situation in Maglaj remained precarious. There were ongoing efforts to reopen Tuzla International Airport for humanitarian purposes. Also welcomed were a European Union fact-finding mission to Mostar to investigate conditions in the city and a joint civil mission to Sarajevo by the governments of the United Kingdom and United States. Throughout the process, the safety and freedom of movement of UNPROFOR personnel was reiterated. After extending UNPROFOR's mandate, the Council decided to increase the size of the mission by up to 3,500 additional troops with a review by 30 April 1994. UNPROFOR's plan for the reopening of Tuzla Airport for humanitarian purposes and its request for additional assistance were approved. It was decided that Member States should, in cooperation with the Secretary-General and UNPROFOR, provide air support in Croatia. All parties were invited to co-operate with UNPROFOR in Croatia on confidence- building measures, including in the United Nations Protected Areas, and to revive the Joint Commission process which would see communication links and economic issues would be resumed and resolved. The Secretary-General was requested by the Council to keep it informed about the implementation of the United Nations peace plan for Croatia and the outcome of the negotiations. Based on these principles, the UNPROFOR mandate could be reviewed at any time. The appointment of an official by the Secretary-General to restore public services in Sarajevo was welcomed. In accordance with Resolution 900 (1994), a voluntary trust fund was established to contribute toward this process. The Security Council expressed with appreciation the steps taken by the United Nations, UNPROFOR and international humanitarian organisations to restore normal life in Bosnia and Herzegovina. All parties were called upon to meet their commitments, particularly for the Bosnian Croat party to release infrastructure equipment and material for humanitarian use. The presence of UNPROFOR and humanitarian aid in Maglaj has welcomed in promoting the well- being of its citizens while concern was expressed at the situation there. The Security Council demanded that the Bosnian Serbs end the military operations against the town of Maglaj and lift its blockade. The Secretary-General suggested that the town be incorporated into the United Nations safe areas, which was noted by the Council.

He was known for his hostility to the prominent Gothic brothers-in-law Alaric I and Ataulf, and was the brother of Sigeric, who ruled the Goths briefly in 415. Career Nothing is known of his life before he comes to notice in 406 commanding a force of Gothic troops, along with other barbarian foederati, against the invasion of Italy by Radagaisus of 405-6.Orosius VII 37 Roman and federate troops ultimately defeated the invaders at the Battle of Faesulae. In 407 he was sent against the British usurper Constantine III. First he defeated and killed Iustinianus, one of Constantine's magistri militum, then tricked and killed the other, Nebiogastes. Then Sarus laid siege to Constantine himself in Valentia, but fled back to Italy at the approach of Constantine's new generals Edobichus and Gerontius, being forced to surrender all his booty to Bacaudae (late Roman bandits or rebels) for passage over the Alps.Zosimus VI 2; Kulkowsky (2000), p. 334 As he must have commanded an army, he may have been appointed magister militum (general) for this expedition;PLRE II p. 978; Boak (1915) p. 159 considers him to have definitely been a magistri militum. elsewhere he is said to have had a following or warband of only about three hundred.Zosimus VI 13; Olympiodorus fr. 3 Early in 408, whilst commanding a force of barbarians at Ravenna, Stilicho induced him to mutiny in an attempt to prevent Honorius from travelling there. Then, when Stilicho was recalled by the Emperor under suspicion of treachery, Sarus, apparently incensed that Stilicho continued to obey orders and refused to use the barbarian troops on hand to defend himself, fought his way through Stilicho's Hun bodyguard to protest.Zosimus V 34 Later in 408, after the fall of Stilicho, Sarus' name was put forward as Stilicho's successor as the most suitable candidate for the office of magister militum in praesenti (supreme commander), but the Emperor Honorius refused to promote him.Zosimus V.36, though Philostorgius Historia Ecclesiastica XII.3 claims he was made magister militum in praesenti. It is possible his resentment of Honorius, as borne out by later actions, started here PLRE II p. 979 We next hear of Sarus in 410, apparently subsisting independently in the region of Picenum. Ataulf, who was coming to join his brother-in-law Alaric, decided to attack him in passing and Sarus, thinking his force of three hundred would be no match for the Gothic army, fled to Honorius.Zosimus VI 13 Later that year, when Alaric was conducting negotiations with Honorius near Ravenna, Sarus with his warband attacked him, seemingly on his own initiative. This prompted Alaric to finally give up on negotiations and sack Rome on August 24.Sozomen IV 9; Bury (1923), p. 183 Death and aftermath Sarus seems to have stayed in the service of the Emperor for the next two years, but when in 412 another usurper, Jovinus, approached from Northern Gaul, supported at first by Ataulf, he went to join him because of a grudge against Honorius, who had failed to investigate or avenge the murder of his servant.This is the reason Boak regards Sarus as a magister militum: the servant, Belleridus, is described as a domesticum, one of the official servants of a general. However it is certain that the future Constantius III was supreme commander in the West by 412; perhaps Sarus was a subordinate general. Boak (1915) p. 159 Sarus had only twenty eight men with him, but Ataulf gathered a force of ten thousand to waylay him. Even so, Sarus fought with marvellous courage and was only with difficulty taken alive, to be soon killed.Olympiodorus fr. 17; Bury (1923) p. 194 Sarus' last contribution to the events of the time were posthumous. Ataulf had been foolish enough to take one of Sarus' followers into his own service; this man waited till Ataulf visited his stable alone and there killed him (September 415).Olympiodorus fr. 25 Sarus' brother, Sigeric, then ruled for seven days before Wallia killed him and took over the kingship.It is easy to see a conspiracy here, as did Bury (1923) p. 199 Sarus was active for only six years in an extremely confused period, yet he made his mark as a figure of some importance in several large and small events of those years. Unfortunately a bald account of his deeds gives a very disjointed picture of him, but he obviously made an impression on those of his time, who describe him as \\"a brave and invincible warrior\\", possessing \\"marvellous heroism\\",Olympiodorus fragments 3 and 17 who \\"excelled all the other confederates in power and rank\\" and had \\"intrepidity\\" and \\"experience in warlike affairs\\".Zosimus V.34 and 36.

What remains is \\"a photo of a painting of a person, and the real person hidden somewhere underneath.\\" She takes a classical concept ‚Äì trompe l'oeil, the art of making a two-dimensional representational painting look like a real three-dimensional space ‚Äì and does the opposite, making real life appear to be a painting. Early life and education Meade was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 2009, with a bachelor's degree in political science.Carlene Thomas-Bailey, ‚ÄúBody art: Alexa Meade‚Äôs living paintings,‚Äù The Guardian, August 31, 2011.Ryan Swearingen, ‚ÄúAlexa Meade,‚Äù Stated Magazine, March 8, 2011. Initially planning on a path in politics,Liat Clark, \\"Watch Alexa Meade‚Äôs full Wired 2012 talk about art, humans and milk,\\" Wired, October 25, 2012. she interned for congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill, and then worked as a press assistant on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Career=Early inspiration and paintings Painting one of her living subjects In 2009, an assignment in an elective art class at Vassar College sparked Meade's curiosity. She decided to explore space and light through the idea of putting black paint on the ground where the shadows were cast. She later expanded the concept by making a grayscale \\"mapping of light\\" with paint on the human body. In so doing, she realized that she had made the three-dimensional form appear to be a two-dimensional painting. The results of these experiments changed her perspective and inspired her to reevaluate her career goals. Despite having grown up surrounded by the political culture of Washington D.C. and initially planning to enter that field herself, as Meade says, ‚ÄúI just felt like even though this was supposed to be my dream, it didn‚Äôt quite fit with who I thought I was on the inside.‚Äù After graduation, she honed her technique in her parents‚Äô Washington, D.C. basement by practicing painting on inanimate objects including grapefruits, fried eggs and sausage. She has credited her lack of formal art training with allowing her to come up with unique ideas of surfaces she could paint on, since she didn't think of painting as something that necessarily had to be done on a canvas.https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/alexa-meade Meade first gained public recognition in March 2010, when her living paintings went viral following a short post about her work on Jason Kottke's blog kottke.org. She soon received coverage on CNN and elsewhere. Her website went from having negligible views to an estimated 30,000-page views the next day.Nell Alk, ‚ÄúThe Artist in Action,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal, June 11, 2012. Her most famous artwork at the time, \\"Transit,\\" features an older man Meade painted on in her basement studio, and then photographed riding the Washington, D.C. metro, looking \\"as if a painting from the National Portrait Gallery has leapt off its wall to go walking through the flesh-and-blood world. Her speech at the 2013 TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, \\"Your Body is my Canvas,\\" offers a behind the scenes look at her work, and details her career beginnings. She has named installation artist Robert Irwin as an inspiration, citing his biography, Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, as an influence on how she thinks about the perception of space. Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics In 2015, Meade was invited to be Artist- in-Residence at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. For this interdisciplinary project, Meade was given free rein to pursue a period of self-directed study of theoretical and quantum physics, and in return she created a collaborative art installation piece with the researchers. The curator of the artist-in-residence program, cited Meade's \\"fearlessness\\" as vital to collaboration, stating \\"She's not one to shy away from asking questions, which created a wonderful synergy between the creative and scientific thought processes.\\" Color of Reality Color of Reality In 2016, Meade painted dancers Jon Boogz and Lil Buck for the short film Color of Reality produced by Animi Design. Color of Reality explores a story about gun violence and racial tensions in America as expressed through painting and dance. Dancer Lil Buck performed his unique style of dancing called Memphis Jookin‚Äô, which is a combination of ballet and street dancing. The short film was critically acclaimed in the press, with The New York Times art critic Gia Kourlas writing: ‚ÄúThink of it as a van Gogh ‚Äî that is, if one of his paintings were brought to life as a performative protest.‚Äù The film was screened at Lincoln Center, the Apollo Theater, and the Hammer Museum. It won CNN Great Big Story's Art as Impact Award, and was included in the National Civil Rights Museum‚Äôs Freedom Awards Ceremony. Ariana Grande: God Is a Woman In 2018 Meade painted on singer Ariana Grande for her music video God Is a Woman. Grande‚Äôs music video director Dave Meyers had seen Meade and Sheila Vand‚Äôs project Milk: What Will You Make of Me? (in which Vand, bodypainted by Meade, lay in a tub of milk, the colors of the paint eventually dispersing and creating patterns throughout the milk) and approached both artists with the idea of bodypainting Grande in a milky pool of paint. The piece shows Grande, nude except for Meade‚Äôs paint in shades of lavender, blue and white, floating in a pool as the colors swirl around her. Allure called it \\"Some of the most gorgeous imagery...striking, empowering.\\" Meade's painted aesthetic set off a beauty and makeup trend, as thousands of people created inspired tribute art. Other projects In 2010, Meade‚Äôs work was exhibited at the Saatchi Gallery in London. Washington Post: Flesh perspective: Alexa Meade's growing body of work is work of the body In 2012, Meade created a live performance at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. for the exhibit Camera-Ready Color. In 2013, she gave a speech at the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, Your Body is my Canvas, in which she offered a behind the scenes look at her work and described the beginning of her career in detail. In 2014, she joined the musician Avicii and others as part of the Project Warehouse campaign for Denim & Supply. As part of the project, she painted large-scale public art installations in Madrid, Santa Monica and Toronto.Apostolos Mitsios, ‚ÄúDenim & Supply Brings Its Warehouse Project, Featuring Artist Alexa Meade, to Madrid,‚Äù HG, September 19, 2014.Rashad Webb, ‚ÄúDenim & Supply Ralph Lauren Teams Up With Music and Art Visionaries to Present Project Warehouse,‚Äù Essential Homme, August 4, 2014. In 2015, Meade created several artworks in Paris, France, including exhibitions at the Grand Palais and the Pinacoth√®que de Paris, and a live performance at David Lynch's nightclub Silencio. In 2015, she was artist-in-residence at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, and created an installation piece inspired by the scientists' work. In 2016 at the Q3 Symposium and Lecture on Peace and Security in a Quantum Age held in Sydney, Australia, Meade joined quantum physicists and scholars to debate the political, ethical and philosophical implications of quantum computing. Also in 2016, Meade was invited to the White House under President Barack Obama for the South by South Lawn (SXSL) event showcasing creators and innovators. In 2017, Meade went on tour with Refinery29‚Äôs installation exhibit 29Rooms. Also in 2016 she created the film Color of Reality with dance artists Jon Boogz and Lil Buck. In 2017, Meade was honored by the Tribeca Film Festival with the Disruptive Innovation Award, an honor celebrating those who \\"inspire and empower people towards innovative thinking and creative activism\\". Her exhibition Immersed in Wonderland in Beverly Hills was attended by 40, 000 visitors in 2018. In 2018-2019, she was a keynote lecturer at Stanford University for Celebration of Mind, a colloquium about the intersection of math, magic, and art.

Wired: How Painter Alexa Meade Creates Dimension- Collapsing Art Alexa Meade's art is still a subject of research and terminology development. In August, 2019, Scientific American wrote: \\"‚ÄúMeade‚Äôs unique work illustrates that depth perception is always a brain construct, not only in art but also in life. Because our retinas are fundamentally flat surfaces, our neurons must infer the third dimension from cues such as shadows, perspective lines or the relative sizes of objects‚Äîboth in paintings and in everyday perception.

This protein is found in most vertebrates (including humans) but is noticeably absent from mice. As with other SNARE proteins, STX10 facilitates vesicle fusion and thus is important for intracellular trafficking of proteins and other cellular components. More specifically, STX10 has been implicated in endosome to Golgi trafficking of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and glucose transporter type 4. STX10 has been detected in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by immunofluorescence.  Structure and function  Human STX10 is a 249 amino acid protein that has three N-terminal Œ±-helices and a single SNARE domain followed by a single-pass transmembrane domain. Human STX10 is 60% identical to human STX6. STX10 is structurally classified as a Qc-SNARE (contributes a glutamine (Q) residue in the formation of the assembled core SNARE complex) and is functionally classified as a t-SNARE (or target-SNARE which is often located in the membranes of target compartments).  Interactions  STX10 is known to interact with the t-SNAREs VTI1A and STX16 and with the v-SNAREs VAMP3 and VAMP4. The SNARE complex of STX10, STX16, VTI1A, and VAMP3 are required for late endosome to Golgi trafficking of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Early endosome to Golgi trafficking of Shiga toxin requires the SNARE complex of STX6, STX16, VTI1A, and VAMP3 or VAMP4. Thus, STX10 distinguishes early endosome to Golgi trafficking from late endosome to Golgi trafficking.

Origins  On 15 August 2007 in Duisburg in North Rhine-Westphalia in front of the Italian restaurant Da Bruno six people belonging to the 'Ndrangheta were killed in a blood feud between 'Ndrangheta families. The event is remembered as the Duisburg massacre. In response to the fragmented representation of the problem of Italian organized crime in Germany, often based on superficial stereotypes, a group of Italian immigrants in Berlin decided to commit to propose to the German civil society a more coherent and thorough reflection and analysis on the issue of mafia in Germany. Inspired by other movements to protect legality in Italy, such as Addiopizzo and Libera, mafianeindanke pursues the following objectives: * Counter the activities of Mafia-like criminal organizations in Germany; * Raise public awareness and the German political class about the problem of organized crime in Germany, for the recognition of the Mafia as a purely extra-national and, contrasting with greater collaboration between states, especially members of the European Union; * Affirm and defend the value of law and the shared awareness that only respecting the rules can be the basis of any modern democratic society; * Maintain and constantly monitor the activities of the Mafia in Germany trying to showcase the work of journalists, magistrates and police involved in fighting criminal organizations; * Support and promote education projects aimed at enhancing the importance of legality; * Offer a point of reference for all those who, feeling threatened by gangs, they need to listen, support, advice, mafianeindanke therefore intends to keep alive the memory of all those who have suffered threats and retaliation by criminal mafias.  Activities  Immediately after the Duisburg massacre, in December 2007 members of one clan of the Camorra attempted to extort money to some restaurateurs in Berlin. mafianeindanke enabled these entrepreneurs to unite and to facilitate communication with the police, and the report of attempted extortion. The criminals were later arrested.

During 2008 mafianeindanke organized a number of initiatives aimed at proposing a public reflection on the topic of organized crime and the means necessary to combat it. Thus, it became clear to the founders that is necessary to discuss systematically the delay of the German legal system with regards to the fight to Mafia. Through collaborations with journalists, politicians, judges and representatives of civil society, mafianeindanke attempted to draw attention on the harmonization of European legal systems. Following a conference held in Berlin in March 2009 mafianeindanke had its first nationwide success in Germany when in July the German Parliament finally introduced a European Directive to recognize rulings of other member states of the Union. mafianeindanke intends to continue the work done so far to introduce in Germany as well as in all EU countries the category of criminal association and push for confiscation to be used as a fundamental weapon in the fight against organized crime.

Set in the rolling hills of the Palouse of north central Idaho, a mile (1.6 km) east of the border with Washington, the par-72 course is at an average elevation of above sea level. The back tees measure a moderate , but the significant elevation changes, terraced fairways, and often breezy conditions contribute to make it a challenging track. The slope rating is 128, with a course rating of 72.3; the men's tees (gold) are at , with a slope of 122 and a course rating of 69.5. The course is open eight months per year, March through October, and is located on the western end of Nez Perce Drive, directly south of the Kibbie Dome stadium and the century-old Shattuck Arboretum. The newer UI Arboretum borders on the east, along and below the 17th & 18th holes. The President's House (now Executive Residence) is across the street, northeast of the 18th green. History The first nine holes were opened in 1937, on the southwest edge of campus, designed by Englishman Francis L. \\"Frank\\" James (1877-1952). At the time a Portland resident, he had designed over a hundred courses, including the other two 9-hole courses in the area: the Moscow Elks course east of town in the late 1920s, and the reconstruction of the original WSC course in nearby Pullman, Washington in 1934. James became the course manager, resident professional, and UI golf coach. Following his death in 1952, the recently completed clubhouse was named for him. The original order of play, using the current hole numbers, was 1, 2, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 9 for par 35 at . Before the second nine was constructed, there was also a pitch-and-putt course north of the original nine holes. The second nine holes (four east (# 10, 16-18) and five north & west (# 3-7) of the original nine) were constructed from 1968 to 1970, designed by golf course architect Bob E. Baldock, and the current clubhouse was built in 1969.lib.uidaho.edu - UI buildings - ASUI Golf Clubhouse - accessed 2010-03-21 A former professional golfer from Newport Beach, California, Baldock designed hundreds of courses in the West, including Hangman Valley south of Spokane, Sun Willows in Pasco,spokanecounty.org - Hangman Valley Golf Course - accessed 2011-11-16 Crane Creek C.C. in Boise, Meadow Creek in New Meadows, and the Lewiston Country Club. All 18 holes at the UI course opened for play in August 1970 with some minor modifications to the original nine. The front and back nines were switched in the 1990s, and both nines contain original holes and newer ones. The course was formerly par 71, as the 7th hole (formerly #16), currently a downhill par-5, was a par-4 prior to the addition of new tee boxes and the greenside pond.ASUI Golf Course scorecard - June 1982 - par 71 - 6810 yd (blue), 6385 (white), par-76 6015 (red) The greenside ponds on the current 1st and 7th holes were added in the mid-1990s.msrmaps.com - aerial photo - May 1992 - no greenside ponds - accessed 2010-07-23UI Golf Course scorecard - Oct 1994 - now par-72 for all tees - nines switched The lowest part of the course is in the southwest corner at the twelfth green; at approximately , it is below the clubhouse. The par-5 fourth hole was part of the grade of the old road to Pullman. The massive water tank behind its green (west) was added in 1980 to satisfy insurance requirements for campus firefighting; the tank north of the tee box was completed in 2010, for chilled water storage for campus air conditioning. The course was originally owned and operated by the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI), the student government. The university took control of the course in 1986, and the lounge was remodeled in 1990. The UI course became the senior 18-hole venue on the Palouse in 2008, when Washington State University in Pullman opened its long-anticipated Palouse Ridge Golf Club in late August. Vandal Golf & Professional Golf Management The UI Golf Course is the home of the Vandal golf teams, which compete in the Big Sky Conference of the NCAA. Idaho was formerly a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) (2005‚Äì14), Big West (1996‚Äì2005), Big Sky (1963‚Äì96), and Pacific Coast (1922‚Äì59) conferences. The university offers a bachelor's degree in Professional Golf Management, a five-year program in the College of Business and Economics.
