He lived in the Village of Mar Ishoo in the region of Shamisdan in modern-day Turkey, near the monastery of Mar Ishoo, which had been built at the beginning of the 5th century. He studied with Rev. Rehana, his father's uncle and head of the Seminary in Mar Ishu Monastery. Yosip was ordained a deacon at age 12 and ordained as a priest in 1912 at the age of 20. In 1914, he was sent as a delegate to participate in a meeting at the patriarchal cell in Qudchanis to discuss the effects of World War I on the Church and the nation and prepare for the changes that were expected to take place. While there, he was consecrated a Bishop on August 10, 1914 at age 22. He remained in Qudchanis until 1916. When the Assyrian Christians sought a safe haven elsewhere, Yosip took a great number of believers to the city of Baqooba. Iraq In 1918, Mār Yōsip was appointed as assistant to the Patriarch Mar Shimun XX Paulos as Locum Tenens. In December 1918 he was elevated to the rank of metropolitan of Baghdad and filled the role as Patriarchal administrator while then Patriarch Mar Shimun XX Paulos was sick, up until his death in 1920. In 1933, he was made administrator of the Church in Iraq and the Middle East. In 1973 when Shimun XXI Eshai, Catholicos Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, was exiled to Cyprus, Yosip Khnanisho was vested with responsibilities of administering the Church worldwide. At the same time the Iraqi government issued a Republican decree appointing Yosip Khnanisho as the Supreme Head of all the Assyrians in Iraq. Death On the 3 July 1977, Yosip died in Baghdad, Iraq. His funeral services were conducted on 6 July 1977, at the Church of St George (Mar Gewargis) in Dora, a suburb of Baghdad. Approximately 12,000 Christians from various cities in Iraq attended the funeral of Mar Yosip Khnanisho. Mār Yōsip Khnanisho Church in San Jose, California, and Mar Yosip Khnanisho Parish in Gilbert, Arizona are both named after the metropolitan.

The national headquarters is Dumbarton House in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.  History  The organization was founded in 1891, shortly after the founding of a similar society, the Colonial Dames of America (CDA). The main difference between the two is that the CDA was created to have a centrally organized structure under the control of the parent Society in New York City. The NSCDA was intended as a federation of State Societies in which each unit had a degree of autonomy.The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America, Pennsylvania Headquarters Another society formed around the same time was the Daughters of the American Revolution. Organized following the United States Centennial of 1876 and a Centennial in New York in 1889 (celebrating the Constitution), they built on renewed interest in America's past to work for preservation of historic collections and buildings, and education related to United States history. The NSCDA has been a leader in the field of historic preservation, restoration and the interpretation of historic sites since its New York Society first undertook the preservation of the Van Cortlandt House in 1897. In November 2000, the NSCDA received the prestigious Trustee Emeritus Award for Excellence in the Stewardship of historic sites from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Today 41 diverse properties are owned outright by the Corporate Societies of the NSCDA, 13 additional museum collections are owned by the Dames and 30 more properties receive substantial volunteer and financial support from Dames. The organization includes 44 Corporate Societies with over 15,000 members. The Society headquarters is located at Dumbarton House (pictured below), in Washington, D.C. In addition to its broad based activities in the museum field, the Society sponsors a number of scholarship programs and other historic preservation, patriotic service and educational projects to further the aims and objects of the Society.

This led to three television series as co-presenter with von Hagens, Anatomy for Beginners (screened in the UK on Channel 4 in 2005), Autopsy: Life and Death (Channel 4, 2006) and Autopsy: Emergency Room (Channel 4, 2007). In the first series, various aspects of human anatomy were explored, with von Hagens dissecting cadavers to illustrate certain points. In the later series particular diseases were highlighted and explained, again with dissections of cadavers, allowing direct observation of the symptoms in humans. During these programmes, Lee provided the background information about, and elucidation regarding, von Hagens' ongoing dissections. In essence, he was used to 'cut away' whilst the less telegenic parts of the dissection proceeded. This background information was usually shown on a television monitor and ensured that the audience could follow the doctors as they worked. Further anatomical and medical information was demonstrated on live models (naked persons with the relevant internal organs drawn and/or projected on to their body). 2020 Coronavirus epidemic In 2020, shortly after his retirement, Dr Lee wrote several prominent articles in The Spectator magazine critical of the UK Government's approach to the Covid 19 coronavirus outbreak,Writers: Dr John Lee, The Spectator magazine website.

Their size and novelty means that they often serve as landmarks. They are distinct from architectural follies, in that novelty architecture is essentially usable buildings in eccentric form whereas follies are non-usable, ornamental buildings often in eccentric form. Although earlier examples exist, such as the planned but never completed Parisian Elephant of the Bastille, the style generally became popular in the United States and spread to the rest of the world as travel by automobile increased in the 1930s. The Statue of Liberty in New York is a replica structure that is part sculpture and part monument, which like many subsequent examples of novelty architecture, has an accessible interior and became a tourist attraction. Constructing novelty architecture near to roads became one way of attracting motorists to a diner, coffee shop, or roadside attraction, so buildings were constructed in an unusual shape, especially the shape of the things sold there. \\"Mimic\\" architecture became a trend, and many roadside coffee shops were built in the shape of giant coffee pots; hot dog stands were built in the shape of giant hot dogs; and fruit stands were built in the shape of oranges or other fruit. Tail o' the Pup mimics a hot dog-shaped hot dog stand; Brown Derby is a derby-shaped restaurant; Bondurant's Pharmacy is a mortar-and-pestle pharmacy; the Big Apple Restaurant and the Big Duck are, respectively, a tall apple and a (now-defunct) poultry store shaped like a duck. Novelty or programmatic (mimetic) architecture may take the form of objects not normally associated with buildings, such as characters, animals, people or household objects. Lucy the Elephant and The Longaberger Company's head office are examples. There may be an element of caricature or a cartoon associated with the architecture. Such giant animals, fruits and vegetables, or replicas of famous buildings often serve as attractions themselves. Some are simply unusual shapes or constructed of unusual materials. Many examples of novelty architecture are designed to attract drive-by customers by taking the form of products sold inside. Others, such as casinos in Las Vegas and Macau, are copies of famous landmarks from around the world.  Buildings resembling objects or creatures  Mimetic architecture, or buildings designed to imitate a giant object or creature, sometimes having to do with what is being sold or showcased inside, were popular in the United States at one point, but also exist in other parts of the world. See, for instance, the High-Heel Wedding Church in Taiwan, the Mr. Toilet House in South Korea, the Museum of Tea Culture in China, the National Fisheries Development Board and the Chowdiah Memorial Hall auditorium in India, the Elephant Building in Thailand, or the Wolfartsweier Cat Kindergarten and the BMW Headquarters in Germany, to name but a few. Buildings styled after famous landmarks Novelty architecture in the form of famous landmarks has been built in China, Georgia, Japan, and the United States, for instance. Such replica buildings are extensively used in casinos, hotels or amusement parks such as Disneyland where the apparent playfulness and whimsy are intended to add to their appeal. In some cases, such as Carhenge, the structure is an adaptation of a well- known building. Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, in the form of novelty architecture include the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel and the New York-New York Hotel & Casino, a building designed to look like the New York City skyline; Paris Las Vegas whose front suggests the Paris Opera House and the Louvre; and Excalibur Hotel and Casino (1990), with its stylized façade of King Arthur's castle (Camelot). In Macau, The Venetian Macao, like its counterpart in Las Vegas, features a replica of St Mark's Campanile and other buildings in Venice. In Batumi on Georgia's Black Sea coast, new high-rise landmark buildings and the renovation of the Old Town have incorporated novelty buildings.Dinah Spritzer, \\"Next Stop: Glamour revives port of Batumi\\", New York Times, September 9, 2010. Many of these constructions are novelty architecture, including the Sheraton Hotel, designed in the style of the Great Lighthouse at Alexandria, Egypt; the Alphabet Tower ( high), celebrating Georgian script and writing; Piazza, a mixed-used development in the form of an Italian piazza; and buildings designed in the style of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Acropolis, and an upside-down White House. In China, the New South China Mall in Dongguan, features a replica of the Arc de Triomphe, another replica of Venice's St Mark's Campanile, a canal with gondolas. In Japan, there is the Huis Ten Bosch theme park near Nagasaki, which has replicas of Dutch landmarks like Huis ten Bosch and the Dom Tower of Utrecht. Water towers and storage tanks Water towers and storage tanks, often prominent features in a small town, are two types of buildings which have been shaped or decorated to look like everyday objects. There are many versions of these types of novelty architecture. Water towers exist in many forms, among them peaches, coffee pots, and teapots; corn cobs, wine bottles, and sauce bottles; and fishing bobbers and strawberries. Several breweries and other businesses have designed holding tanks in the shape of giant cans of beer or other containers. Giant sculptures Sculptures of ordinary items scaled to building size are another aspect of novelty architecture. Such sculptures appear at roadside parks and attractions or museums in Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines and the United States. They are likely to represent local animals, such as fish or other wildlife; local plants, such as apples or pineapples; well-known local people such as Paul Bunyan; food, such as the branded candy bars at the former Curtiss Candy Company; sporting or mechanical equipment such as giant bats, balls, or tires; musical instruments, such as guitars; clothing, such as giant boots; or popular creatures, such as dinosaurs. In some instances, the giant sculpture provides a reference for the building to which it is connected. Examples are the giant baseball bat outside the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory and the giant \\"paper\\" aircraft at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Other styles Architecture popular in the 1950s-1960s in southern California and in Florida featured sharp corners, tilted roofs, starburst designs, and fanciful shapes. This came to be known as Googie, Doo Wop, or populuxe architecture. Long-established firms whose features are well-known could still qualify as novelty architecture; examples include McDonald's original golden-arches design and the self- referential design of the White Castle restaurants. Deconstructivism Critics of architectural deconstructivism such as Nikos Salingaros, argue that much contemporary architecture is actually Novelty architecture. Leading architects of \\"the populist, yet the aggressive\\" forms of Gehry, Libeskind and Hadid reverses architecture's main raison d'etre: to provide viable shelter\\" and appeal instead to \\"novelty, excitement and meaningless intellectual acrobatics\\".

The initial area of low pressure developed off the coast of Atlantic Canada on October 29. Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone. The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast. On November 1, the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane, with peak sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the precursor extratropical storm. It later received the name \\"the Perfect Storm\\" (playing off the common expression) after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger. The system was the twelfth and final tropical cyclone, the eighth tropical storm, and fourth hurricane in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating. Damage from the storm totaled over $200 million (1991 USD) and the death toll was thirteen. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to struck the coastline from Nova Scotia to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the vacation home of then-President George H. W. Bush. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, the damage was worse than that caused by Hurricane Bob two months earlier. Aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the fishing vessel Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm. Meteorological history The Perfect Storm originated from a cold front that exited the east coast of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest. The tropical storm making landfall west of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on November 2 While situated about south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of up to . The nor'easter reached peak intensity at approximately 12:00 UTC on October 30 with its lowest pressure of 972 millibars. The interaction between the extratropical storm and the high pressure system to its north created a significant pressure gradient, which created large waves and strong winds. Between the southern New England coast and the storm's center, the pressure differential was . A buoy located south of Halifax reported a wave height of on October 30. This became the highest recorded wave height on the Scotian Shelf, which is the oceanic shelf off the coast of Nova Scotia. East of Cape Cod, a NOAA buoy located at reported maximum sustained winds of with gusts to , and a significant wave height (average height of the highest one-third of all waves) of around 15:00 UTC on October 30. Another buoy, located at , reported maximum sustained winds of with gusts to and a significant wave height of near 00:00 UTC on October 31. Upon peaking in intensity, the nor'easter turned southward and gradually weakened; by November 1, its pressure had risen to . The low moved over warm waters of the Gulf Stream, where bands of convection around the center began to organize. Around this time, the system attained subtropical characteristics. On November 1, while the storm was moving in a counter- clockwise loop, a tropical cyclone had been identified at the center of the larger low. (Although these conditions are rare, Hurricane Karl during 1980 formed within a larger non-tropical weather system.) By around 14:00 UTC on November 1, an eye feature was forming, and the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of ; these estimates, combined with reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit flight into the storm and confirmation that a warm-core center was present, indicated that the system had become a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane accelerated toward the northeast and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm. It made landfall near Halifax, Nova Scotia, at 14:00 UTC on November 2, with sustained winds of . While the storm was approaching the coast, weather radars depicted curved rainbands on the western side of the system. After crossing over Prince Edward Island, the storm fully dissipated late on November 2. Preparations and naming The Perfect Storm to the south of Nova Scotia on October 30. For several days, weather models forecast the development of a significant storm off New England. However, the models were inadequate in forecasting coastal conditions, which in one instance failed to provide adequate warning. In addition, a post-storm assessment found an insufficient number of observation sites along the coast. On October 27, the Ocean Prediction Center noted that a \\"dangerous storm\\" would form within 36 hours, with its wording emphasizing the unusual nature of the storm. The National Weather Service likewise issued warnings for the potential storm, providing information to emergency service offices as well as the media. The public however was skeptical and did not recognize the threat. The timely warnings ultimately lowered the death toll; whereas the Perfect Storm caused 13 deaths, the blizzard of 1978 killed 99 people, and the 1938 New England hurricane killed 564 people. From Massachusetts to Maine, thousands of people evacuated their homes and sought shelter. A state of emergency was declared for nine counties in Massachusetts, including Suffolk County, as well as two in Maine. In North Carolina, the National Weather Service offices in Hatteras and Raleigh first issued a heavy surf advisory on October 27, more than eight hours before the first reports of high waves. That same day, a coastal flood watch and later a warning was issued, along with a gale warning. The Hatteras NWS office ultimately released 19 coastal flood statements, as well as media reports explaining the threat from the wind and waves, and a state of emergency was declared for Dare County, North Carolina. The warnings and lead times in the region were described as \\"very good\\". In Canada, the threat from the storm prompted the cancellation of ferry service from Bar Harbor, Maine, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, as well as from Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island and between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In its tropical cyclone report on the hurricane, the National Hurricane Center only referred to the system as \\"Unnamed Hurricane\\". The Natural Disaster Survey Report called the storm \\"The Halloween Nor'easter of 1991\\". The \\"perfect storm\\" moniker was coined by author and journalist Sebastian Junger after a conversation with NWS Boston Deputy Meteorologist Robert Case in which Case described the convergence of weather conditions as being \\"perfect\\" for the formation of such a storm. Other National Weather Service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of the typical NHC advisories. The OPC posted warnings on the unnamed hurricane in its High Seas Forecasts. The National Weather Service State Forecast Office in Boston issued Offshore Marine Forecasts for the storm. Local NWS offices along the East coast covered the storm in their Coastal Waters Forecasts. Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named instead, it would have received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace. Impact Oceanfront flooding in Ocean City, New Jersey The Halloween Storm of 1991 left significant damage along the east coast of the United States, primarily in Massachusetts and southern New Jersey. Across seven states, damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD). Over a three-day period, the storm lashed the northeastern United States with high waves, causing damage to beachfront properties from North Carolina to Maine. The coastal flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and closed roads and airports. In addition, high winds left about 38,000 people without power. The total without power was much less than for Hurricane Bob two months prior, and was fairly low due to little rainfall and the general lack of leaves on trees. Overall there were thirteen confirmed deaths, including six on board Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat. The vessel departed Gloucester, Massachusetts, for the waters off Nova Scotia. After encountering high seas in the middle of the storm, the vessel made its last radio contact late on October 28, about northeast of Sable Island. Andrea Gail sank while returning to Gloucester, her debris washing ashore over the subsequent weeks. The crew of six was presumed killed after a Coast Guard search was unable to find them. The storm and the boat's sinking became the center-piece for Sebastian Junger's best-selling non-fiction book The Perfect Storm (1997), which was adapted to a major Hollywood film in 2000 as The Perfect Storm starring George Clooney. Tamaroa, a Coast Guard cutter that rescued the crew of a downed Air National Guard helicopter Despite the storm's severity, it was neither the costliest nor the strongest to affect the northeastern United States. It was weakening as it made its closest approach to land, and the highest tides occurred during the neap tide, which is the time when tide ranges are minimal. The worst of the storm effects stayed offshore. A buoy northeast of Nantucket, which was west of Andrea Gail last known position, recorded a rise in wave height in 10 hours while the extratropical storm was still rapidly intensifying. Two buoys near the Massachusetts coast observed record wave heights, and one observed a record wind report. The United States Coast Guard rescued 25 people at sea at the height of the storm, including 13 people from Long Island Sound. A New York Air National Guard helicopter of the 106th Air Rescue Wing ditched during the storm, south of Montauk, New York, after it was unable to refuel in flight and ran out of fuel. After the helicopter had attempted a rescue in the midst of the storm, an 84-person crew on the Coast Guard Cutter Tamaroa arrived and rescued four members of the crew of five after six hours in hypothermic waters. The survivors were pilots Dave Ruvola and Graham Bushor, flight engineer Jim Miolli, and pararescue jumper John Spillane. The fifth member, pararescue jumper Rick Smith, was never found. They were all featured on the show I Shouldn't be Alive. Following the storm's damage, President George H. W. Bush declared five counties in Maine, seven counties in Massachusetts, and Rockingham County, New Hampshire to be disaster areas. The declaration allowed for the affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans. New Jersey governor Jim Florio requested a declaration for portions of the coastline, but the request was denied because of the funding needs of other disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo, Hurricane Bob, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The American Red Cross opened service centers in four locations in Massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food, clothing, medicine, and shelter. The agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food, and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3,000 families. New England and Atlantic Canada Along the Massachusetts coastline, the storm produced wave heights on top of a high tide. In Boston, the highest tide was , which was only lower than the record from the blizzard of 1978. High waves on top of the storm tide reached about . The storm produced heavy rainfall in southeastern Massachusetts, peaking at . Coastal floods closed several roads, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. In addition to the high tides, the storm produced strong winds; Chatham recorded a gust of . Damage was worst from Cape Ann in northeastern Massachusetts to Nantucket, with over 100 homes destroyed or severely damaged at Marshfield, North Beach, and Brant Point. There were two injuries in the state, although there were no fatalities. Across Massachusetts, damage totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Street flooding in Ocean City, New Jersey, from the storm Elsewhere in New England, waves up to reached as far north as Maine, along with tides that were above normal. Significant flooding was reported in that state, along with high winds that left areas without power. A total of 49 houses were severely damaged, 2 were destroyed, and overall more than 100 were affected. In Kennebunkport, the storm blew out windows and flooded the vacation home of then-President George H. W. Bush. The home sustained significant damage to its first floor. In Portland, tides were above normal, among the ten highest tides since record-keeping began in 1914. Along the coast, damage was worse than that caused by Hurricane Bob two months prior. Across Maine, the storm left $7.9 million (1991 USD) in damage, mostly in York County. More than half of the damage total was from property damage, with the remainder to transportation, seawalls, and public facilities. Although there were no deaths, there were two injuries in the state. In neighboring New Hampshire, coastal flooding affected several towns, destroying two homes. The storm destroyed three boats and damaged a lighthouse. High waves destroyed or swept away over 50,000 lobster traps, representing $2 million in losses (1991 USD). Damage was estimated at $5.6 million (1991 USD). Further west, high winds and coastal flooding lashed the Rhode Island and Connecticut coasts, killing a man in Narragansett, Rhode Island. Winds reached in Newport, Rhode Island, causing power outages. Off the coast of Atlantic Canada, the storm produced very high waves, flooding a ship near Sable Island and stranding another ship. Along the coast, the waves wrecked three small boats near Tiverton, Nova Scotia, as well as nine boats in Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador. In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30 mm), and 20,000 people in Pictou County were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68 mph (110 km/h) near St. Lawrence. There were at least 35 traffic accidents, one fatal, in Grand Falls-Windsor due to slick roads. Prior to the storm's formation, there was a record 4.4 in (116 mm) of snowfall across Newfoundland. The storm caused no significant damage in Canada, other than these traffic accidents. Mid-Atlantic states The cyclone near its closest approach to the United States In New York and northern New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded the beach at Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the Delmarva Peninsula and Virginia Beach, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. Farther south In North Carolina along the Outer Banks, high waves were initially caused by Hurricane Grace and later its interaction with a high pressure system. This produced gale-force winds and waves in the town of Duck. Later, the extratropical predecessor to the unnamed hurricane produced additional high waves, causing oceanfront flooding from Cape Hatteras through the northern portions of Currituck County. Flooding was first reported on October 28, when the ocean covered a portion of North Carolina Highway 12 north of Rodanthe; the route is the primary thoroughfare in the Outer Banks. Nags Head, Kitty Hawk, and Kill Devil Hills had large portions covered with water for several blocks away from the beach. The resultant flooding damaged 525 houses and 28 businesses and destroyed two motels and a few homes. Damage was estimated at $6.7 million (1991 USD). Farther south, the storm left 14 people injured in Florida. There was minor beach erosion and flooding, which damaged two houses and destroyed the pier at Lake Worth. In some locations, beaches gained additional sand from the wave action. Two people went missing off Daytona Beach after their boat lost power. High waves destroyed a portion of State Road A1A. Damage in the state was estimated at $3 million (1991 USD). High waves also affected Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, waves of affected the island's north coast, which prompted 32 people to seek shelter. The waves swept a person off a large rock to his death.

Graduating classes are fewer than fifty students each year. The school was founded as Chatham Episcopal Institute in 1894, Chatham Hall. The athletics teams play in the Blue Ridge Conference. Chatham Hall is accredited by the Virginia Association of Independent Schools (VAIS) and is a member of the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC). Traditions Pruden Hall, Chatham Episcopal Institute, from a postcard, pre 1920 The Honor Code is a vital tradition at Chatham Hall and is strictly followed. It states \\"I will not lie. I will not cheat. I will not steal. I will report all infractions of honor.\\" Any honor infraction will result in a \\"council case\\" held by the student council, a group of 12 seniors elected by the students and faculty. The lantern ceremony and ring ceremony are held by the junior and senior classes the night before graduation when the junior class members officially receives their class rings and assume leadership of the school from seniors. Each senior girl seals the back of her junior ring-sister's ring with melted wax from her lantern. Since the inception of Chatham Hall, the class ring has not changed; it is a simple white or yellow gold band with the school's crest engraved into an oval red sardonyx stone. \\"Senior Night in the Well\\" takes place when the senior class puts on a Christmas play for the rest of the school the night of Decoration Day, when everyone in the school is assigned a part of the school to decorate. Juniors are in charge of decorating the dining hall (Yardley Hall), the Sophomores are in charge of decorating St. Mary's Chapel, and the Freshman make wreaths to hang on the doors of the school. Cookie Break is a long- standing tradition where every Wednesday morning the girls gather in the Arcade to eat cookies, fruit and beverages. The New Girl picnic starts off the school year traditions every year with a picnic and the first athletic rivalries among the purple and gold teams. This is also when the new girls are placed on either the Purple Team or Gold Team. Additionally, there are many \\"underground\\" societies that are composed of senior girls, taken in at the end of their junior year by graduating members. As part of the tradition, the meaning of the titles of these societies is known to only the senior girls and those who have already graduated. The administration has sought without success to dismantle these societies. \\"Wills\\" are items that are passed on from student to student. The criteria for who these items are passed down to is pre-determined. The items that are willed can range from posters to t-shirts. For example, a humorous sign is willed from a Junior student to a Freshman student. The Freshman would then hold on to the will until she reached her Junior year at which point she would then will the sign to a new Freshman girl. This tradition, like most, promotes relationship-building between the girls of differing graduating classes. For the past nine years during the summer, Chatham Hall has hosted Jacob's Ladder, an enrichment program for AIG (Academically Intellectually Gifted). Students from North Carolina and Virginia board on campus for about a month and a half. Sims- Mitchell House, Chatham, early home of Chatham Hall after fire of 1906 Chatham Hall Chapel Chatham Hall's Chapel has quite a history of its own. The windows of the Chapel are a sequential story of medieval heroines. All are crafted by hand in a 15th-century-style stained glass. The stories progress in a timeline from right to left in the chapel. When one first enters the Chapel, the story-telling begins at the back right corner, continues along the pews until the altar, and then begins again on the left side back to the arched wooden entrance. At the very rear of the chapel, one would find the \\"Rose Window,\\" a large circular, blue-toned window depicting the Virgin Mary and Christ. The Virgin overlooks all the other saints' windows. This set-up was done to demonstrate how Christ looked after all of the saints and would continue to look after the Chatham Hall girls throughout their academic career at Chatham Hall. Beyond the stained-glass windows, the Chapel is a staple in the life of a Chatham Hall student. Chapel is required three times a week and all of the student's most important days of the four-year school experience are centered in the Chapel from day one at the welcoming ceremony clear through to the Senior Chapel Talks given by all senior Chatham Hall students. The chapel talks given by the Senior girls are emotional and cathartic in value. They provide insight into the student that the other students might not have been aware of. The Chapel Talks are done to bring the students together, demonstrate the strength of each particular student, and to draw the student's senior year to a close prior to commencement. Sports Chatham Hall offers a wide array of interscholastic and intramural sports. These sports include field hockey, basketball, soccer, lacrosse, cross-country, tennis, golf, volleyball, swimming, and riding. Chatham Hall is well known for its riding program and facilities, including the Mars Riding Arena and Hunter Trial Field. The campus is home to more than 40 horses, two additional teaching arenas, and plenty of trails throughout the rolling hills. The riding program teaches hunt seat equitation, the Modern Forward Riding System, with an emphasis on horse and rider communication. It also focuses on stable management, ensuring that students learn to be true horsewomen, not just riders. More advanced students are encouraged to compete locally and nationally, and regularly take home notable ribbons, trophies, and titles. The program consists of a Varsity and Junior Varsity team. Both Varsity and JV riders have the option to join Chatham Hall's Interscholastic Equestrian Association (IEA) team. The IEA team has won many titles since its inception in 2011, including Reserve Champion at IEA Nationals during the 2014–2015 season. Chatham Hall offers an increasingly competitive swimming and diving program which has produced numerous collegiate swimmers, including Division 1 athletes. The team trains at Hargrave Military Academy at its Olympic-size pool and won four Blue Ridge Conference Championship titles in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In addition, the school offers dance during the athletics period each day after classes. Classes include ballet, contemporary, and choreography. There are three performances each year, and they are based around student-choreographed pieces. Guest artists come to teach classes at Chatham Hall. These classes include hip hop, African dance, and classical ballet.

This area is composed of mostly farm land. Within the town there is one school, Lawrence Academy (Private), which was founded in 1968 and is located on Avoca Farm Road. In the middle of the town is the post office, with the zip code 27957. Avoca Incorporated is a large company, located where the original Avoca Plantation existed, that profits from botanical extraction. Salmon Creek twists and turns through the wooded area of Merry Hill and opens up to the Albemarle Sound. This is known as the Mouth of Salmon Creek. There is currently a golf course called Scotch Hall Preserve in Merry Hill, built in 2009, that overlooks the Mouth of Salmon Creek and reaches out into the Albemarle Sound. The course was designed by retired professional golfer Arnold Palmer.  History  Most of the history took place in the southern part of Merry Hill known as Avoca. Avoca is Indian for \\"Meeting of the waters.\\" Basically, it is the land between Black Walnut Swamp and the mouth of Salmon Creek which is at the juncture of Salmon Creek, Chowan River, and the Albemarle Sound. In May 2012, the British Museum in London discovered evidence that the famed Lost Colony was planned to move to a fort in Avoca. A map owned by Lost Colony founder John White was scanned, and the symbol for a fort was found under a patch (see https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=753203&partid;=1). Some researchers believe that the surviving colonists may have moved to Avoca. Avoca was in its earlier days owned by Seth Sothel, N.C. Governor. When he died it passed to a \\"kinsman Ardenne\\". At Ardenne's death it passed to his widow, and when she married the Tory Duckenfield, it passed into that name. Sir William Duckenfield and/or his mother, Mrs. Person lived there until her death circa 1780s. The land 36,000 acres (150 km) was sold as tory confiscated lands, and the money thus derived was used to open the University of North Carolina. Both Sothell and Duckenfield had trading posts on the mouth of Salmon Creek at Avoca prior to 1690. Located in Merry Hill, the old Avoca Plantation was owned by the Cullen Capehart family for many years. His son, George Washington Capehart, built the nearby Scotch Hall. Avoca came from the Indian word, \\"where separate waters come together\\". The Dr. W. R. Capehart is buried there in the family cemetery. He was the Assistant Surgeon General in the Civil War (Confederate). Recently laid to rest in the Avoca cemetery are the ashes of William Selby Harney, Jr. (1913–2010), grandson of Dr. William Rhodes Capehart, buried with the ashes of his beloved late wife, Jeanne Waugh Harney. Horse racing took place and many years later this sport was one of the annual social events. Every fall at Avoca, Dr. Capehart's half mile enclosed ring attracted horses, sulkies and riders from miles around. His horse, a state winner, was named \\"Chapel Hill\\". Although George and his father, Cullen, maintained separate households, it is believed that they worked their extensive plantations in partnership. At the time of the 1850 Census, Cullen Capehart owned 4,965 acres (20.1 km) of land valued at $48,800 on which his 203 slaves raised 8,500 bushels of corn, 200 bales of ginned cotton, and livestock worth $4,000. In addition to the plantation, the Capeharts also operated a fishery off Batchelors Bay in the Albemarle Sound.[Laura Harrel, \\"Capehart's Fishery Era Recalled at Spring Historical Meeting\\" There are many old pecan trees planted in the 19th century that are still there. There is an old Episcopal church on one acre of land on Avoca Plantation. The land was donated by Dr. W. R. Capehart and named \\"The Church of the Holy Innocents\\" by the wife of Mr. Cadmus Capehart. It was consecrated on April 12, 1880 by the Rt. Rev. Theodore B. Lyman, Assistant Bishop of North Carolina. The Capehart family attended church there for years at the beginning. There was also a Capehart's School House there at one time. The Capehart's Baptist Church was organized in 1824, initially as Capehart's Meeting House. George Capehart (son of \\"Buddy\\" George Capehart) and his sister, Sue Martin Capehart Hardy sold most of the farming land to the RJR Avoca Division. The Capehart family once owned the entire peninsula, 5,000 acres (20 km) fenced from Salmon Creek to Albemarle Sound. In recent years RJR sold the division and is now known as Avoca Incorporated. Elmwood, The Hermitage, and Scotch Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Geography  According to the 2000 census, the town has a total area of 44.72/sq mi. The land area is 44.68/sq mi. The water area is 0.04/sq mi.  Education  *Lawrence Academy Demographics According to the 2000 census record there were 1,074 people, and 444 households. The population density was 24.0/sq mi. The housing unit density was 13.3/sq mi. The racial makeup of the town was 49.2% White, 50.2% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.1% other, 0.3 two or more races. Within the 444 households 25.0% had children under the age of 18, 49.5% had married couples living together, 17.1% were female householders with no husband present. 26.4% of the households were occupied by individuals and 12.8% were age 65 and older living alone. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 2.90.

It was manufactured in at least five known versions and incarnations by Tucson, Arizona-based Maxi Switch, now a subsidiary of LiteOn Technology Corporation. The AnyKey is no longer manufactured, with the latest dated model available marked 1997. Maxi Switch, Gateway, and LiteOn currently do not offer any product labeled as or comparable to the AnyKey. The AnyKey keyboard is easily distinguished from other generic keyboards by an extra double column of F keys on the left side, a unique eight directional arrow key pad as opposed to the traditional inverted T, and a quartet of extra keys directly above the numeric pad that control the programmable aspects of the keyboard. They are labeled “Program Macro”, “Suspend Macro”, “Repeat Rate”, and “Remap”, reading left to right. All versions of the AnyKey are white or very light gray with some keys (notably the programming keys, extra function keys, and arrows) in a darker gray. Features and construction The AnyKey is a 124-key PC keyboard, comprising the usual complement of 101 keys as well as 23 additional keys. The keyboard includes 12 extra function keys, four programming keys, and four additional arrow keys for diagonal input, as well as one blank key in the center of the eight way arrow key area that normally acts as a second space bar but can be programmed. The AnyKey has a fourth indicator light labeled “Program,” located to the right of the Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock lights. Revisions of its design that predate the advent of the “Windows” keyboard have an asterisk (*), backslash (), or hash (#) in the windows key locations, depending on the intended locale. Since the design of the AnyKey predates the “multimedia PC,” it lacks the additional multimedia keys (play, pause, volume) present on many modern keyboards. A unique feature of the AnyKey is its hardware programmability. The keyboard contains an internal controller as well as an EEPROM chip that can store user-defined macros. Any key on the keyboard can be programmed to contain a macro of arbitrary length or can be programmed to act like any other key on the keyboard (remapped). This is done on the hardware level inside the keyboard's controller itself. No driver software is required to use the AnyKey’s programming functionality, as the keyboard’s own controller dictates which keypress codes are sent to the attached computer. A utility for MS-DOS exists to quickly remap the entire keyboard to a predefined configuration or save its current configuration to a file, but it is not required to use or program the keyboard. The AnyKey’s EEPROM memory will retain its data even if the keyboard is unplugged indefinitely, so settings and programming aren’t lost if the computer is powered down, unplugged, or if the keyboard is unplugged or moved to a different computer. The keyboard can be programmed to call up and execute software programs in the computer, but must compensate for the time it takes the computer to execute the program via inserting a delay of 1–5 seconds before entering a subsequent series of commands. The controller board inside the Anykey contains six integrated circuit packages (“chips”) in addition to various signal regulation hardware including 15 diodes, 11 capacitors, and nine resistors of unknown specific function in addition to four green LEDs for signalling purposes of (left to right)“NUM LOCK”, “CAPS LOCK”, “SCROLL LOCK”, and “PROGRAM”. The chips included are an Intel P8052AH microcontroller, an Atmel AT28C16 16 kilobit EEPROM chip, and four Fairchild Semiconductor Decoder/Demultiplexer chips of various descriptions. The AnyKey is available in AT and PS/2 style configurations, and can be used with either configuration via a simple adapter. As its design predates the implementation of the USB standard, no USB AnyKey keyboard was ever produced. However, a PS/2 to USB converter will allow the AnyKey to be used with modern USB systems. The AnyKey is constructed of a plastic chassis that is large compared to most modern keyboards (partially owing to the extra columns of keys on the left side) and also slightly thicker than most keyboard casings of the present era. It is rounded on all corners and edges, with an overall rectangular shape. As with many keyboards, there are two plastic feet that can be flipped down from the upper corners to tilt the keyboard into a suitable typing position. There is also a long central plastic foot, on some versions, that can be flipped down to tilt the keyboard to a less severe angle than the two outside feet. The AnyKey uses rubber dome type keyswitches, with all the switches and contact points on a single sheet. The keyswitch layer contacts a single flexible membrane that detects all keypresses and directs them to the controller board via a pair of flexible edge connectors. While the AnyKey is branded as a Gateway product, the membrane layer clearly bears the inscription “Maxi Switch Inc,” revealing the true maker of the hardware. This membrane is backed by a metal plate approximately a sixteenth of an inch thick which serves to hold the membrane rigid and in place as well as giving the keyboard considerable heft. Held in place on top of the rubber dome layer is a plastic block that holds the key pillars which in turn hold the keycaps themselves. The key pillars are individually replaceable but cannot be removed without dismantling the keyboard to separate the rubber dome layer from the plastic support layer and the removal of the latter from the assembly. The key caps are held onto the pillars via friction with cross shaped pegs. The key caps are easily removed for cleaning or rearrangement, as all keys on the keyboard use the same attachment method and, with the exception of the Space Bar, Enter, Shift, Tab, Control, Alt, and Caps Lock keys, they are all the same size. In this manner, keys that have been remapped (like the commonly remapped arrow keys) can also be physically moved to the correct location on the board. Physical relocation of keytops should be done with caution as the slope of the keytops is raked into three pairs of rows, e.g. if the Z key is swapped with the F1 key, both keys will have different rake to those surrounding them. The rubber domes themselves are made of silicone rubber and are not therefore subject to oxidation or brittling through loss of plasticizer in the rubber. The AnyKey also has a user programmable repeat rate (the rate at which a key will repeat its function on the computer if it is held down) that is handled by the controller inside the board and therefore overrides the BIOS or operating system controlled repeat rate on the attached computer. The repeat rate is set by pressing the “Repeat Rate” key and then one of the top row F keys, with F1 being the slowest rate and F8 being the fastest — then press “Repeat Rate” again. Programming The AnyKey keyboard is extensively programmable. This takes two forms: Remapping, and macro programming. The only keys on the AnyKey that cannot be programmed in at least some way are those used to control the programming itself – Program Macro, Suspend Macro, Repeat Rate, and Remap. Any other key on the keyboard including letters, numbers, arrow keys, and even special keys like modifiers such as Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Enter, and the Space Bar can be programmed. Remapping A key can be remapped (copied to a different location on the keyboard) by pressing the REMAP key once (depending on the revision of the keyboard, the Ctrl key may also need to be held down), pressing the key to be copied, and then pressing the new key that will serve as the new destination for the old key's command. The Program light on the keyboard will flash as long as it is awaiting remapping commands. Multiple keys can be remapped without pressing REMAP again. The Program light will continue blinking after one key has been remapped and the keyboard will await more remapping commands with the same method as before. On each keypress, the REMAP light will pause, flashing momentarily to signal that a keypress has been registered. Pressing REMAP again before completing a remapping cancels the operation. Pressing REMAP after at least one remapping has been completed will save all the remappings but will cancel an incomplete one if it is in progress. After remapping, the old key will retain its original function even after being remapped elsewhere, effectively creating two copies of the same key. After it is remapped somewhere else, the original or 'old' key can be remapped to a different function or have a macro programmed to it. CAUTION: Although Shift and Ctrl can be reprogrammed using Macros as described in the next section, they should not be remapped. Unpredictable results may occur, depending on how long those keys are held down. Therefore, in REMAP mode, pressing the sequence Shift (without holding it down), and then lowercase-A, sometimes remaps the A key to become another Shift key, but not dependably. However, the following restoration process dependable. To restore a remapped key to its original function, press the REMAP key and then press the remapped key twice. This is known as “remapping a key to itself”. Pressing the REMAP key will cause the Program light to begin flashing, indicating that the very next key that is pressed will be remapped. Macros Any key can also be programmed with a macro and can be combined with key modifiers Alt, and/or Ctrl (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Q, Ctrl+Alt+F1). Macros are multiple presses of various keys in sequence of arbitrary length. The “extra” F keys on the left of the keyboard are essentially reserved for having macros programmed to them, though they mirror the function of the F keys along the top of the keyboard before they are programmed. The keyboard treats both sets of F keys as separate, however. Remapping or programming one of the F keys will not change the function of its counterpart. A macro is programmed to a key by pressing the “Program Macro” button once (depending on the revision of the keyboard, the Ctrl key may also need to be held down), pressing the key that will have the macro assigned to it once, and then entering the commands to be programmed. Any sequence of key presses is valid input, including letters, numbers, keys used in conjunction with shift, alt, and control, F keys, cursor movement, remapped keys, and even other keys programmed with macros. The Program light flashes as long as the keyboard is accepting programming input. It pauses momentarily when the key to be assigned the macro is pressed to indicate that the keypress was picked up. Pressing Program Macro for a second time ends the programming session and saves the macro to the target key. Pressing it again before entering any programming input cancels the operation. A key can be cleared of its macro by pressing Program Macro and then pressing the key twice. Pressing a programmed key will “play back” all the keypresses that were programmed into it at the current repeat rate of the keyboard. On versions that require Ctrl + \\"Program Macro\\" at start the programming session, you still use \\"Program Macro\\" to end programming session. If the last 2 keystrokes are ctrl + \\"Program Macro\\" the ctrl stroke becomes part of the macro. When this macro is run \\"ctrl\\" key is stuck on preventing other macros running until another ctrl key press to clear the keyboard state. The Program light normally remains solidly on or off depending on whether the keyboard is set to use macros, which can be toggled by pressing the Suspend Macro key. The state of the Program light does not reflect whether there are any macros programmed into the keyboard, merely whether the keyboard is in macro mode. Pressing the Suspend Macro key will cause the Program light to go out and will cause all keys programmed with macros to behave with their usual functions instead of their programmed macros. Keys that have been remapped do not reset themselves while macros are suspended. Pressing Suspend Macro again relights the Program light and restores the macros to all programmed keys. A DOS utility, sized about 25Kb, was offered by Gateway for saving and uploading AnyKey key mappings and macros, named “anykey.exe” or “anykey34.exe,” and may still be found by searching the Internet. It offers three functions: Saving key mappings and settings from keyboard nonvolatile memory to a file, uploading settings from the file to the keyboard’s nonvolatile memory, and checking the file’s integrity. It must run in DOS, and it may require the keyboard be connected through a PS/2 or AT-style 5-pin-DIN socket, though a PS/2<—>USB adapter seems to work well for normal keyboard usage. Clearing all keyboard programming *Holding the Control and Alt keys and pressing the Suspend Macro key clears all of the keyboard's programming. The Program light will flash while the keyboard erases its memory. Afterwards, it will go dark and all keys will be reset to their original function, all macros deleted, and all remappings reset. *Holding down the Suspend Macro key while powering on the computer will also reset all keys to their original function. Features The programmability of the AnyKey results in complex rules being forged pertaining to its behavior. If a macro includes the press of a key that has another macro programmed to it, the second macro will be ignored and the original function of the key will be programmed into the new macro. If a macro includes a key that has been remapped, the macro will be programmed with the remapped function of the key and not its original function. If a macro is too long to fit in the keyboard's memory, it will be truncated at the point that the keyboard ran out of programming memory. There is no upperbound limit to the length of a macro except the total free memory remaining in the keyboard, which is believed to be a maximum of 16 kilobits (2048 x 8 bits) based on the controller board's inclusion of an Atmel AT28C16 EEPROM chip. The Number Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock keys cannot have macros assigned to them, but they can be included in other macros. These keys can be remapped and remapped to, however. Despite the fact that \\"AnyKey\\" is in the name, there is no \\"Any\\" key on these keyboards. Versions At least five versions of the AnyKey are known to exist, with manufacturing dates starting in 1990 and ending in 1997\`. Functionally, the various versions of the keyboard are almost identical. They differ in their connection method, marking, and in some minimal areas of behavior. The version and vintage of an AnyKey keyboard can be determined by reading a small paper label on the underside, generally placed near the lower center over the third screw hole. Unfortunately, these labels are unlaminated plain paper printed with a simple dot matrix printer and over time turn yellow and brittle and are easily damaged. In addition, the labels are very often placed such that one of the more important numbers – the date – is placed directly over one of the screw holes that must be accessed to dismantle the keyboard. An Anykey that has been serviced undoubtedly has some of its date and model information destroyed. The oldest known version, unofficially dubbed “version 1”, is of an unknown part number. It has an AT style plug and has “Gateway 2000” in raised, painted lettering on its upper left face with a gold painted Gateway G logo. It has “AnyKey” printed on the upper right face, to the right of the “Program” inscription. There is a silvery gray label on the underside bearing the Gateway 2000 name and logo, the Anykey logo, the keyboard's FCC ID number, an FCC Part 15 warning, and the least pertinent part of the model number: “2189014-XXX”. This keyboard can be programmed simply by pressing the Program Macro key. The internals of this version of keyboard are held together with many small yellow zinc plated screws that hold the metal plate, membrane, rubber dome layer, and plastic support layer together as well as holding all of the above into the chassis. The second known version is part number 2189014-00-211, unofficially dubbed “version 2”. Their most common vintage is 1992. These are visually very similar to version 1 keyboards, with the same AT style plug and chassis. However, version 2 keyboards lack the “AnyKey” inscription on their face. The silver label on the reverse still bears the AnyKey moniker. This keyboard is held together with screws as is the previous version. [Macros must be programmed on this version by holding down control and pressing Program Macro. Simply pressing Program Macro does nothing.]—The foregoing may be true of some specimens of this model, but on at least one 'Program Macro' alone works. The Print Screen key has the additional label \\"Sys Rq\\" on the front edge, and the Pause key has the additional label \\"Break\\" on the front edge. Keytops from later AnyKey keyboards will not necessarily match cosmetically, as the later lettering is a little closer to the bottom of the keytop, and the strokes slightly thinner. The 2189014-00-211 Gateway AnyKey model contains a toroid on the inside, around the keyboard wires near the top middle of the keyboard, which might rub against the plastic membrane circuit board and cut the leftmost trace emerging from the left ribbon connector. The circuit board numbers of the dead, non-responsive, keys will be: 19 (\\"Program Macro\\"), 46 (number pad minus \\"-\\"), 90 (left side function key \\"F7\\"), 91 (left side function key \\"F8\\"), 97 (\\"B\\"), 98 (\\"N\\"), 102 (slash \\"/\\"), 104 (left arrow), 105 (space key between left and right arrow keys), 106 (right arrow), 110 (left side function key \\"F9\\"), 111 (left side function key \\"F10\\"), 113 (gray asterisk between left side Ctrl and Alt keys \\"*\\"), 115 (space bar), 116 (right side \\"Alt\\"), and 120 (down arrow). These numbers are printed on the plastic membrane next to each key switch, with the exception of 106, which is obscured by a carbon bridge. The cut trace can be repaired by filling in the hole with conductive ink from a silver microtip conductive pen or possibly with copper paint from a rear-window defroster repair kit from an automobile supply store. The dried paint can then be covered with tape or epoxy. Soldering, which would damage the plastic membrane, is not a repair option. The toroid should be repositioned or covered with tape or something to blunt its edge. The third known version is part number 2189014-00-212, with at least one model being produced in February 1993. These are visually very similar to part number 2189014-00-211, with the same AT style plug and chassis, silver label on the reverse bearing the AnyKey moniker, screws holding the keyboard together, macro programming requiring the control key, and lacking the AnyKey inscription on their face. An alternate version is part number 2189014-00-712 with a PS/2 style plug. The fourth known version is part number 2191011-00-911 and it is creatively dubbed “version 3”. Its most common vintage seems to be 1994. This version has a PS/2 style plug and like the version 2 does not have the “AnyKey” inscription on its face. The silver gray label on the reverse is done away with, replaced with raised lettering that is very difficult to read. The raised lettering is otherwise identical to the writing on the labels of previous versions. As with the version 2's, this keyboard must be programmed by holding control while pressing Program Macro. Inside, this version's controller board is longer and narrower with a slightly different layout than previous versions. Unlike said previous versions, this version's chassis is held together with screws but the internals are held together and bound to the lower half of the chassis by many plastic pegs that are a part of the support layer. These are pushed through the lower chassis and melted into a mushroom shape (\\"heat staked\\"), holding the keyboard together and making it impossible to disassemble for service without breaking or carefully drilling out the heat fastened pegs. After being dismantled, keyboards of this version are difficult to properly reassemble due to their lack of screws to align the internals. A fifth version exists that bears the model number 2194001-XX-XXX stamped into the bottom of the keyboard. In addition there is a specific model number (such as 2194001-00-002) on both a bar code sticker and a model number/serial number label that also includes a date such as \\"MAXI SWITCH MEXICO 01-21-95\\". This version has a PS/2-style plug and has five screws instead of the heat staked attachments. A sixth version is very similar to the fifth, but the stamped model number is changed to 2194002-XX-XXX. Its vintage is late 1995 to mid 1996, with the most recent model having \\"MAXI SWITCH 06-27-06\\" printed on the label. This version has a PS/2 style plug like \\"version 3\\" and also has screws securing the internals. A seventh(?) version exists \\"MAXI SWITCH MEXICO 08-23-96\\", another \\"05-28-97\\". At first glance the only obvious difference to previous models is that the PS/2 plug is bright orange. The real significance of this unit is the recognition of the extra Windows keys added. Rather than retool the unit to allow the addition of the three extra keys and therefore altering the standard layout around the space bar, a simple electronic change was made to the decoder and some keys relabeled. Using an extended IBM Model M as a guide, to the left of the space are three keys: CTRL * ALT  which are relabeled CTRL WINALT  and on the right of the space bar, ALT  * CTRL  are labeled ALT WINMENU . How many people remapped the MS keys to reproduce the right-hand CTRL key is unknown. The AnyKey keytops fit interchangeably with Cherry MX keytops. Value Gateway bundled or offered the AnyKey keyboards with most of their desktop systems from 1990 to 1995. The keyboard featured advanced programmability, making it possible for users to re-program the Anykey keyboards in unintentional ways. Manufacturing of the AnyKey ceased circa 1997 and Gateway stopped offering them shortly thereafter. Maxi Switch, the actual manufacturer of the AnyKey, got into financial trouble and was bought by LiteOn in 1990 where it remains a subsidiary as of January 2006. Production of the AnyKey has not resumed by Maxi Switch, LiteOn, or any of LiteOn's subsidiaries. The Anykey does not use the same distinctively loud buckling spring keyswitches of the older “battleship” keyboards. It is significantly larger, heavier, and more durable than most modern keyboards (incorporating a sheet of steel running the width and length of the base, a ¼\\"-thick sheet of black plastic under the key bed, and weighing a bit over 3 lbs./400 grams) in addition to being serviceable (though some versions more serviceable than others; see above). The Anykey lacks Windows and multimedia keys except for model 2194002-XX-XXX, shipped by Gateway at the beginning of 1996 with Windows 95, which had “Windows” keys. There are Anykey keyboards dated as late as 1998. This model works correctly in normal mode under Windows 7.

Taking place in a political party office after a day of campaigning, \\"Ivy Day in the Committee Room\\" discusses candidate Richard Tierney as people filter in and out. Ivy Day refers to the anniversary of Charles Parnell, important Irish figure and nationalist. Plot summary In a committee room, Mat O'Connor, a canvasser for Richard Tierney, a candidate in an upcoming municipal election, discusses child-rearing with Old Jack, who tries to keep a fire going. Joe Hynes, another canvasser, arrives and needles O’Connor on whether he’s been paid for his work yet. He proceeds to defend rival candidate Colgan's working-class background and maintains that Tierney, although a Nationalist, will likely present a welcome address at the upcoming visit of King Edward VII. When Hynes points out that it is Ivy Day, a commemoration of Charles Stewart Parnell, a nostalgic silence fills the room. Another canvasser, John Henchy, enters and derides Tierney for not having paid him yet. When Hynes leaves, Henchy voices a suspicion that the man is a spy for Colgan. Henchy badmouths another canvasser, Crofton, just before Crofton himself enters with Bantam Lyons. Crofton had worked for the Conservative candidate until the party withdrew and gave their support to Tierney. The talk of politics drifts to Charles Stewart Parnell, who has his defenders and detractors in the room. Hynes returns and is encouraged to read his sentimental poem dedicated to Parnell. The poem is highly critical of those who betrayed him, including the Roman Catholic Church, and places Parnell among the ancient heroes of Ireland. All applaud the performance and seem to forget their differences for the moment. Background The ideas for both \\"The Dead\\" and \\"Ivy Day\\" Joyce attributed to Anatole France, although the latter story also owes something to his brother Stanislaus' account of his father at work during a Dublin by-election three years earlier. After being rejected by Symon’s publishers, Joyce sent Dubliners - then comprising only twelve stories - to publisher Grant Richards. It took nearly eight years for the book to be published. Going back and forth with Richards, who initially agreed to publish his work, Joyce revised and omitted many things in the book to reach an agreement. However, Richards objected to too many things and eventually simply refused to publish Dubliners at all. Ireland has a prominent role in Joyce's writing. Having been under the rule of Great Britain since the sixteenth century, a longstanding division has always separated the two islands. Joyce found the city of Dublin especially interesting: “I do not think that any writer has yet presented Dublin to the world. It has been a capital of Europe for thousands of years, it is supposed to be the second city of the British Empire and is nearly three times as big as Venice.” In \\"Ivy Day in the Committee Room\\" Joyce touches on the deep-rooted political struggle by noting nationalist Charles Stewart Parnell and his role in Irish politics. His representation in \\"Ivy Day\\" is clear from the title of the story: Ivy Day is the anniversary of the death of Parnell, the \\"uncrowned king of Ireland\\". Parnell wanted to give the Irish people a greater role in the management of their own affairs. Parnell's ousting from power served to delay Irish independence. In \\"Ivy Day in the Committee Room,\\" the campaigners for Tierney are not campaigning for him to get into office but rather as a way for them to earn money. They acknowledge, however, that “Some of those hillsiders and Fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me... Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers? I believe half of them are in the pay of the Castle” (i.e. Protestant officials). “Fenian” was a nickname given to those conspiring in a revolutionary movement to free Ireland from Britain, a radical nationalist. The inactivity in “Ivy Day in the Committee Room” serves to show Joyce’s view of Irish nationalism. The stagnant conversations speak to Ireland’s paralytic nature. Nothing being accomplished in this story reflects the fact that nothing was being done about obtaining Ireland’s independence. After Parnell's death, an Irish cultural and political movement was set into motion. Citizens tried to figure out what it meant to live in Ireland with strong Irish roots. Ireland split into segregated religious groups–Catholics versus Protestants. Most Irish were Catholic and wanted independence from Britain. These were the radicals; the conservatives were in favor of staying under British rule. This sheds light on the two pillars of cultural nationalism: the Catholic faith and Gaelic heritage leading to people to learn the \\"Irish” language, Gaelic, renewing a sense of cultural nationalism, pride in their country: “The Celtic Revival attempted to produce a new Irish culture in the absence of compelling political cohesion after the death of Parnell.” References *Joyce, James.

Coye is probably best remembered for his black-and-white illustrations for pulp magazines and horror fiction, but he produced a variety of works in other media. Biography Coye was born in Syracuse, New York, and as a young man lived in nearby Tully. He spent his entire life in the Central New York area. He and his wife, Ruth, lived in Syracuse for many years where Coye's activities included teaching adult art classes; working under the Works Progress Administration to paint a mural in the Cazenovia High School in 1934 (since destroyed); advertising for the WSYR Broadcasting System in upstate New York, producing a variety of commissioned works. The Coyes settled in Hamilton, New York, in 1959 when Lee went to work for Sculptura, a small company that reproduced antique sculptures. The move to Hamilton allowed Coye to fulfill his ambition of returning to a small town and maintaining his own art studio. Coye was almost entirely self-taught as an artist, and his entire life was devoted to art-related work. As a young man, he attended one semester of night art classes, but his artistic knowledge and abilities came from many years of work and a thorough study of nature. His astute knowledge of body parts developed from his studies of anatomy and his work as a medical illustrator. He spent time attending operations and autopsies, thus becoming extremely familiar with the human body assembled or not. Recurring motifs  One recurring feature in Coye's work is the motif of wooden sticks, often in latticework-like patterns. This was inspired by a 1938 discovery in an abandoned farmhouse. Coye had returned to the North Pitcher, New York, area where he spent much of his childhood. While wandering deep in the woods, Coye discovered an abandoned farmhouse. Boards and pieces of wood which had been set perpendicular to one another surrounded the site. Neither inside nor out could Coye find an explanation for the presence of these crossed sticks. In the years following, Coye remained interested in the significance of his discovery. When Coye returned to the site in 1963, there was nothing left of the building or the sticks (the area had suffered severe flooding), and he never found out why the sticks were there or who it was that had arranged them in such a manner. Because of the strangeness of the entire experience, these forms never left Coye, and they appear in many of his paintings and illustrations. The incident also inspired Coye's friend Karl Edward Wagner to write the award-winning story \\"Sticks\\". A four-page portfolio of Coye's work accompanies the printing of Wagner's story in Gahan Wilson, ed. First World Fantasy Awards. NY: Doubleday, 1977, (between pages 168 and 169). The crescent moon was an early Coye motif in paintings and illustrations. The whale became a later signature motif. Coye fashioned wooden sculptures, silver pendants and pins, engravings, drawings, and a large painting of the whale. One very fine example is in the Morrisville State College Library collection the pine \\"Moby- Dick\\" sculpture created in 1965. Image of Moby Dick Sculpture Illustrator of the macabre  Coye's cover for the Weird Tales Robert Arthur's \\"The Mirror of Cagliostro \\" on the June 1963 issue of Fantastic Stories Coye's fame as an illustrator of the macabre developed as a result of his drawings for three horror anthologies edited by August Derleth in the early 1940s, Sleep No More (1944), Who Knocks (1946), and The Night Side (1947). This subsequently led to additional work for Weird Tales, a popular pulp magazine. Coye's work first appeared in the March 1945 issue of Weird Tales, illustrating the story 'Please Go Way and Let Me Sleep\\" by Helen Kasson. This tale gave Coye the chance to show dead bodies in various states of decomposition.Gahan Wilson, \\"Lee Brown Coye: An Appreciation, in Wilson, ed. First World Fantasy Awards, NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 256-57. From 1945 to 1952, his covers and interior work, in a long and fruitful association with the magazine, captured images of horror and the supernatural. A review of Pulp Macabre: The Art of Lee Brown Coye's Final and Darkest Hour said his work for Weird Tales produced \\"some of the magazine's greatest covers and as well as some of the most memorable illustrations to ever appear in pulps\\". In the 1960s, Coye's work appeared in such magazines as Fantastic and Amazing. Coye illustrated, as well as the H. P. Lovecraft collection, Three Tales of Horror (Arkham House, 1967), and two deluxe collections of pulp stories edited by Karl Edward Wagner and published by his imprint Carcosa : Manly Wade Wellman's Worse Things Waiting (1975) and Hugh B. Cave's Murgunstrumm and Others (1978). Coye won the World Fantasy Award for best artist in 1975 and 1978. Coye was in the midst of illustrating Cave's volume Death Stalks the Night, which would have been the fifth volume published by North Carolina publishing house Carcosa, when he suffered a crippling stroke and eventually died. The volume's editor, Karl Edward Wagner, abandoned plans to publish through Carcosa, however the volume was eventually issued, with the illustrations Coye had completed, by Fedogan and Bremer. Other work Although Coye is best known for his fantasy and horror illustrations, for more than fifty years his artistic output covered a much wider range. He was a watercolor, oil, and egg tempera painter, a muralist, a sculptor, a photographer, a silversmith, and an able builder of models and dioramas. From rats and beetles and disfigured bodies, to whales, mythic figures, and landscapes, Coye's subjects are as diverse as the media in which he worked. All of his work was executed with expert craftsmanship, and exhibits the originality that sprang from his renowned imagination and sense of humor. Coye created paintings, sculpture, and jewelry that are as beautiful as his illustrations are macabre. Image of Night Side cover Coye exhibited at the Whitney Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His work is represented in numerous collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Everson Museum in Syracuse, the Onondaga County Historical Society, Picker Art Gallery at Colgate University, the Morrisville State College Library, SUNY Oswego, Syracuse University, and private collections. In 2015 Where Is Abby? & Other Tales was published. The book features some stories from Coye's \\"Chips and Shavings\\" Coye's column printed by \\"Mid-York Weekly\\" newspaper between 1964 and 1970. One of these tales (based on true stories) also appears (as \\"From Chips and Shavings\\") in Gahan Wilson, ed. First World Fantasy Awards. NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 277–78. The book Pulp Macabre: The Art of Lee Brown Coye's Final and Darkest Era was published in 2015.

History  Early in Garden Valley history there were three elementary schools scattered throughout the region. There was no high school located in Boise County, so until 1926 any children wishing to continue their education past the eighth grade would board at the high school in Emmett, Idaho; a distance of around . In 1926, Garden Valley attempted to build its first high school on School House Gulch Rd. Upon completing construction, the building soon caught fire and the first year of school was held in a local granary. However, they were able to rebuild the school at a different site, at 1076 Banks Lowman Hwy, and at that site the school would sit until the fall of 2009. Garden Valley's high school was the first in Boise County until 1990, when Horseshoe Bend opened up a second high school. The high school was built eight years before the town of Crouch was founded in 1934. In 1930, Garden Valley High School graduated its first class. This first high school building remained at its location until 1964, when it was sold to a private owner and moved off the site to make way for a new school in 1965. That school slowly grew into a web of modules that eventually incorporated all the different elementary schools in the area, excepting the schoolhouse located in Lowman; although students from Lowman still attended high school at Garden Valley. Garden Valley School District encompasses around in the northeast corner of Boise County. Once opened, the high school's population has slowly grown in proportion to Boise County. Although class sizes shrank with the opening of both Horseshoe Bend HS in 1990 and Idaho City HS in 1995, today they hover around 22 students per class. With the opening of the new school in 2009, Garden Valley School District finally consolidated all the outlying buildings, excepting Lowman School, into one structure. This new structure was paid for with bonds and grants and had at least one add-on, the Wrestling Room, “donated” at cost by local construction companies. The new structure is relatively technologically advanced with Smart Boards in all the classrooms. There is also a bio-mass boiler which will heat the school at considerable reduced cost from a traditional electric system. Like many “advanced” things in the school, they were paid for partially with grants and federal money.

According to the creation myth, \\"Creation myths are symbolic stories describing how the universe and its inhabitants came to be. Creation myths develop through oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions.\\" of the Abrahamic religions, he was the first man. In both Genesis and Quran, Adam and his wife were expelled from the Garden of Eden for eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Various forms of creationism and biblical literalism consider Adam to be a historical person. Scientific evidence does not support the idea that the entire human population descends from a single man. The word adam is also used in the Bible as a pronoun, individually as \\"a human\\" and in a collective sense as \\"mankind\\". Biblical Adam (man, mankind) is created from adamah (earth), and makes considerable play of the bond between them, for Adam is estranged from the earth through his disobedience. Origin And Elohim Created Adam, William Blake The majority view among scholars is that the book of Genesis dates from the Persian period (the 5th and 4th centuries BCE), but the absence from the rest of the Hebrew Bible of all the other characters and incidents mentioned in chapters 1–11 of Genesis, (Adam appears only in chapters 1–5, with the exception of a mention at the beginning of the Books of Chronicles where, as in Genesis, he heads the list of Israel's ancestors) has led a sizable minority to the conclusion that was composed much later, possibly in the 3rd century BCE. Usage=Mankind—human being—male individual The Bible uses the word ( 'adam ) in all of its senses: collectively (\\"mankind\\", ), individually (a \\"man\\", ), gender nonspecific (\\"man and woman\\", ), and male (). In Genesis 1:27 \\"adam\\" is used in the collective sense, and the interplay between the individual \\"Adam\\" and the collective \\"humankind\\" is a main literary component to the events that occur in the Garden of Eden, the ambiguous meanings embedded throughout the moral, sexual, and spiritual terms of the narrative reflecting the complexity of the human condition. Genesis 2:7 is the first verse where \\"Adam\\" takes on the sense of an individual man (the first man), and the context of sex is absent; the gender distinction of \\"adam\\" is then reiterated in Genesis 5:1–2 by defining \\"male and female\\". Connection to the earth A recurring literary motif is the bond between Adam and the earth (adamah): God creates Adam by molding him out of clay in the final stages of the creation narrative. After the loss of innocence, God curses Adam and the earth as punishment for his disobedience. Adam and humanity are cursed to die and return to the earth (or ground) from which he was formed. This \\"earthly\\" aspect is a component of Adam's identity, and Adam's curse of estrangement from the earth seems to describe humankind's divided nature of being earthly yet separated from nature. God himself, who took of the dust from all four corners of the earth with each color (red, black, white, and green), then created Adam therewith, where the soul of Adam is the image of God. Citation: \\"God had fashioned his (Adam's) soul with particular care. She is the image of God, and as God fills the world, so the soul fills the human body; as God sees all things, and is seen by none, so the soul sees, but cannot be seen; as God guides the world, so the soul guides the body; as God in His holiness is pure, so is the soul; and as God dwells in secret, so doth the soul\\". In the Hebrew Bible God Judging Adam, William Blake, 1795 Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures, with humankind as the last of his creatures: \\"Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam ...\\" (). God blesses mankind, commands them to \\"be fruitful and multiply\\", and gives them \\"dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth\\" (). In , God forms \\"Adam\\", this time meaning a single male human, out of \\"the dust of the ground\\" and \\"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\\" (). God then places this first man in the Garden of Eden, telling him that \\"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\\" (). God notes that \\"It is not good that the man should be alone\\" () and brings the animals to Adam, who gives them their names, but among all the animals there was not found a companion for him (). God causes a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and forms a woman (), and Adam awakes and greets her as his helpmate. , the story of the Fall: A serpent persuades the woman to disobey God's command and eat of the tree of knowledge, which gives wisdom. Woman convinces Adam to do likewise, whereupon they become conscious of their nakedness, cover themselves, and hide from the sight of God. God questions Adam, who blames the woman. God passes judgment, first upon the serpent, condemned to go on his belly, then the woman, condemned to pain in childbirth and subordination to her husband, and finally Adam, who is condemned to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death. God then expels the man and woman from the garden, lest they eat of the Tree of Life and become immortal. The chiastic structure of the death oracle given to Adam in forms a link between man's creation from \\"dust\\" () to the \\"return\\" of his beginnings. :A you return :::B to the ground ::::C since (kî ) from it you were taken ::::C' for (kî ) dust you are :::B' and to dust :A' you will return deals with the birth of Adam's sons Cain and Abel and the story of the first murder, followed by the birth of a third son, Seth. , the Book of the Generations of Adam, lists the descendants of Adam from Seth to Noah with their ages at the birth of their first sons (except Adam himself, for whom his age at the birth of Seth, his third son, is given) and their ages at death (Adam lives 930 years). The chapter notes that Adam had other sons and daughters after Seth, but does not name them. Post-Biblical Jewish traditions Adam, Lucas Cranach the Elder Body According to jewish literature, Adam possessed a body of light, identical to the light created by God on the first day. According to Jewish mystical tradition the original glory of Adam can be regained through mystical contemplation of God. Adam, Lilith and Eve The rabbis, puzzled by the verse of Genesis 1 which states that God created man and woman together, told that when God created Adam he also created a woman from the dust, as he had created Adam, and named her Lilith; but the two could not agree, for Adam wanted Lilith to lie under him, and Lilith insisted that Adam should lie under her, and so she fled from him, and Eve was created from Adam's rib. Her story was greatly developed, during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim, the Zohar and Jewish mysticism. Other rabbis explained the same verse as meaning that Adam was created with two faces, male and female, or as a single hermaphrodite being, male and female joined back to back, but God saw that this made walking and conversing difficult, and so split them apart. Eve's fault in the Fall The serpent approached Eve rather than Adam because Adam had heard the word of God with his own ears, whereas Eve had only his report; Eve tasted the fruit and knew at once that she was doomed to death, and said to herself that it was better she trick Adam into eating so that he too would die, and not take another woman in her place. Adam ate the fruit unaware of what he was doing, and was filled with grief. When Adam blamed Eve after eating the forbidden fruit, God rebuked him that Adam as a man should not have obeyed his wife, for he is the head, not her. Children of Adam and Eve Adam withdrew from Eve for 130 years after their expulsion from Eden, and in this time both he and Eve had sex with demons, until at length they reunited and Eve gave birth to Seth. A 2nd-century BCE Jewish religious work, the Book of Jubilees, tells how Adam had a daughter, Awân, born after Cain and Abel,Jubilees 4:1. and another daughter, Azûrâ, born after Seth,Jubilees 4:9 and they had nine other sons;Jubilees 4:10 Cain married Awân and Seth married Azûrâ, thus accounting for their descendants. The Life of Adam and Eve and its Greek version the Apocalypse of Moses recount how Adam repented his sin in exile and was rewarded by being transported to the heavenly paradise, foreshadowing the destiny of all the righteous at the end of time. Adam's death and burial The Archangel Michael attended Adam's death, together with Eve and his son Seth, still living at that time, and he was buried together with his murdered son Abel. Because they repented, God gave Adam and Eve garments of light, and similar garments will clothe the Messiah when he comes. According to the Apocalypse of Moses, which probably originates in first-century CE Jewish literature, the altar of the Temple of Solomon was the centre of the world and the gateway to God's Garden of Eden, and it was here that Adam was both created and buried. Attitude towards Adam In the 17th-century book Kav ha-Yashar, the author warns not to talk negatively about Adam, and writes that those who talk positively about Adam will be blessed with a long life.Parshat Chukat A similar warning can be found in The Zohar.Zohar Chadash Parshat Beresheit 24a or in older versions 19 Adam and the angel Raziel The Sefer Raziel HaMalakh (רזיאל המלאך) (Raziel the Angel) is a collection of esoteric writings, probably compiled and edited by the same hand, but originally not the work of one author, which according to tradition was revealed to Adam by the angel Raziel. The book cannot be shown to predate the 13th century, but may in parts date back to Late Antiquity, and like other obscure ancient texts such as the Bahir and Sefer Yetzirah, it has been extant in a number of versions. Zunz (\\"G. V.\\" 2d ed., p. 176) distinguishes three main parts: (1) the Book Ha-Malbush; (2) the Great Raziel; (3) the Book of Secrets, or the Book of Noah. These three parts are still distinguishable—2b–7a, 7b–33b, 34a and b. After these follow two shorter parts entitled \\"Creation\\" and \\"Shi'ur Ḳomah\\", and after 41a come formulas for amulets and incantations. \\"Raziel, Book of\\". Jewish Encyclopedia (1906). In Christianity=Original sin The idea of original sin is not found in Judaism nor in Islam, and was introduced into Christianity by the Apostle Paul, drawing on currents in Hellenistic Jewish thought which held that Adam's sin had introduced death and sin into the world. Sin, for Paul, was a power to which all humans are subject, but Christ's coming held out the means by which the righteous would be restored to the Paradise from which Adam's sin had banished mankind. He did not conceive of this original sin of Adam as being biologically transmitted or that later generations were to be punished for the deeds of a remote ancestor. It was Augustine who took this step, locating sin itself in male semen: when Adam and Eve ate of the fruit they were ashamed and covered their genitals, identifying the place from which the first sin was passed on to all succeeding generations. Only Jesus Christ, who was not conceived by human semen, was free of the stain passed down from Adam. (Augustine's idea was based on the ancient world's ideas on biology, according to which male sperm contained the entire unborn baby, the mother's womb being no more than a nurturing chamber in which it grew.) Adam's grave: Golgotha replaces Solomon's Temple As mentioned above, the Apocalypse of Moses, a Jewish writing containing material probably originating from the first century CE, places both Adam's place of creation and his burial at the altar of the Temple of Solomon, seen as the centre of the world and the gateway to the Garden of Eden. The early Christian community adapted this to their own legend of Golgotha, replacing the altar with the place of Jesus's crucifixion. According to this Christian legend, current in the time of Origen (early 3rd century CE), the holy blood of Christ trickled down and restored to life the father of the human race, who then led the saints who appeared to many in Jerusalem on that day as described in Scripture. In Islam Adam and Eve, Manafi al-Hayawan (The Useful Animals), Maragheh, Iran, 1294–99 In Islam, God created Adam (Arabic: آدم) from a handful of earth taken from the entire world, which explains why the peoples of the world are of different colours. According to the Islamic creation myth, he was the first prophet of Islam and the first Muslim. The Quran says that all the prophets preached the same faith of submission to God. When God informed the angels that he would create a vice-regent (a khalifa) on Earth, the angels enquired, saying, \\"will You place therein such that will spread corruption and bloodshed?\\" So God showed the angels, saying, \\"Tell Me the names of these?\\" The angels had no knowledge of these, as God had not taught them. Then God allowed Adam to reveal these names to them, saying, \\"Did I not say to you (angels) that I know what is unseen in the heavens and the earth and I know what you (angels) reveal and what you (Satan) conceal;\\" the scholar Al-Tabari explained that God was referring to Iblis (Satan) of his evil plans and to the angels of their honesty. Adam and Eve both ate of the Tree of Immortality, and both shared guilt equally, for Eve neither tempted Adam or ate before him; nor is Eve to blame for the pain of childbirth, for God never punishes one person for the sins of another. The Shia school of Islam does not even consider that their action was a sin, for obedience and disobedience are possible only on Earth, and not in heaven where the paradise is located. Adam fell on a mountain in India, the tallest in the world and so the closest to Heaven, and from there God sent him to Mecca, where he repented and was forgiven. At Mecca he built the first Sanctuary (the Kaabah – it was later rebuilt by Ibrahim) and was taught the ritual of the Hajj, and wove the first cloak for himself and the first veil and shift for Eve, and after this returned to India where he died at the age of 930, having seen the sons of the sons of his children, 1400 in all. According to the Ahmadiyya sect Adam was not the first human being on earth, but when the human race came into existence, and spread all over the world and developed the ability to receive revelation, God sent Adam to each and every branch of civilization. According to a revelation received by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the community, the Adam mentioned in the Quran was born 4,598 years before Muhammad. In the Quran, Adam is given the name by God known as the (Adam-I-Safi) or The Chosen One.https://www.academia.edu/7170404/Shaggy_or_Shaved (Scroll down to page 12) Adam was given the honorary name of \\"Adam-I-Safi\\" meaning: THE CHOSEN ONEhttps://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ijt/07-2_056.pdf Bottom of page 57: \\"Adam was God's Chosen one \\"Adam-Safi\\" See also * Adam's grave or burial site of his skull ** Cave of Machpelah in Hebron; according to traditional Jewish belief ** Temple of Solomon; according to the Jewish book, the Apocalypse of Moses ** Golgotha; now Adam's Chapel in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem; according to Christian tradition based on the Apocalypse of Moses ** Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem; according to Christian tradition ** Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf; according to Shia tradition, after Noah buried him there following the deluge. * Adam Kadmon * Adapa * Banu (Arabic) * Eve * List of Old Testament pseudepigrapha ** Life of Adam and Eve ** Apocalypse of Adam ** Testament of Adam ** Books of Adam ** Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan * Mahabad (prophet) * Manu * Paradise Lost * Table of prophets of Abrahamic religions * Y-chromosomal Adam NotesReferences=CitationsBibliography      External links  * * Adam Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Biblical patriarchs ","title":"Adam"},{"id":"3775594","text":"Khatanga may refer to: *Khatanga, Russia, a rural locality (a selo) in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia *Khatanga, West Bengal, gram panchayat in India *Khatanga Airport, an airport in Krasnoyarsk Krai *Khatanga (river), a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia *Khatanga Gulf, a gulf at the Taymyr Peninsula See also *Katanga (disambiguation) ","title":"Khatanga"},{"id":"3775596","text":"Constable & Co.) The Parasite is an 1894 novelette by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The Parasite makes use of a form of mind control similar to the mesmerism of the Victorian era; it works on some hosts but not others. Plot summary The main character is a young man known as Austin Gilroy. He studies physiology and knows a professor who is studying the occult. The young man is introduced to a middle-aged woman known as Miss Penclosa, who has a crippled leg and psychic powers. She is a friend of the Professor's wife. The skeptical Gilroy's fiancée, Agatha, is put into a trance to prove Miss Penclosa's powers. This succeeds and Gilroy begins to go to the Professor's house where Miss Penclosa practices her powers on him. This is so Gilroy can look at the physical part of the powers. Miss Penclosa 'falls in love' with the unfortunate Gilroy. She starts to use her powers on him to make him caress and utter sweet nothings to her. He loses his temper and rejects her love, and she begins to play tricks on him with her powers. The series of cruel tricks ends with him in Agatha's room carrying a small bottle of sulphuric acid. He notices that it is half-past three. He rushes to Miss Penclosa's home and demands her presence at the door. The nurse there answers in a frightened tone that she died at half-past three.

Known for his crass humor, he is also known for his nickname, El Gangster. As of 2008, his television show, No te Duermas, has been on the air for 19 years.  Biography = Early life  Antonio Sánchez was born in New York City to Antonio Sánchez, Sr. and Zoraida Casiano. He was the oldest of four children. When he was 9 years old, his family returned to Puerto Rico, and settled in the town of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico.  Radio Host  Sánchez started studying at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico in San Germán, and he began working as a disc jockey at college parties with his now partner Angél Santiago. He was also in the midst of the late 1970s CB Radio craze where he used the handle \\"Tony Toyota\\". In 1979, while studying, he started working at a local station called Radio Disco. He was then called to work at Cosmos 94 in Mayagüez with two shows called La Hora del Rusheo (1981) and El Meneo (1982). He also worked for Salsa 63. It is during this time that he donned the name of \\"El Gangster\\". According to him, he is extremely shy, and his radio persona was a way to let go a more extroverted attitude. In 1983, he was asked to work in San Juan, so Sánchez left his studies and moved to the capital. He started working at QBS AM Radio with El Pon de la Mañana with \\"Funky Joe\\", and later started working in El Gufeo Matutino at Z-93 with \\"Moonshadow\\". In 1994, he returned to work with his friend, hosting El Bayú de la Mañana at SalSoul radio station. They remained together in the show from 1994 to 2007 when they were replaced due to differences with management. In January 2008, they started hosting a new show called El Circo de La Mega at 106.9 FM. www.elcirco.net  Television works  In 1985, Sánchez started working on several television shows like A Gozar (WAPA-TV), El pueblito Nius and El Show del mediodía. The next year, he hosted the game show Lo tomas o lo dejas. In 1987, Sánchez and friend Hector Marcano were cast as co-hosts of television game show La Hora de Oro on Puerto Rico's Super Siete channel. The show enjoyed a successful run for two years in Puerto Rico, period in which Sanchez's face also became familiar to the Puerto Rican public. During this time, he also performed in comedies like El Cuartel de la Risa (1989) and Adultos Solteros (1990), both with Rafael José. In 1989, Sánchez was approached by producer Gabriel Suau to intervene in a show called No te Duermas. Although originally the idea was to have another host while Sánchez performed comedic sketches, Sánchez presented Suau an idea he had about a television program, and he gave him the opportunity. In February 1990, No te Duermas debuted on Channel 7 (Super Siete). After a year of success, the show moved to Channel 2 (Telemundo) in October 1991. For two years, the show peaked at #1 on local TV popularity lists, and for the following years it remained among the Top 10. In 1992, Sánchez also began production of Minga y Petraca, where he plays one of the main characters. The show was a spin-off of a sketch from No te Duermas, where two ladies (played by Sánchez and Johnny Ray) would constantly gossip on their balcony about local celebrities. In March 2005, the show was cancelled because Telemundo Puerto Rico wanted to open a new telenovela spot at 9:00pm, making all the sitcoms and programs at this spot to be axed, only leaving Sanchez's No Te Duermas, as a daily show. In 2008, after 18 years, Sánchez announced he would retire the show to take a break and dedicate himself to other ventures. The last show aired on December 30, 2008. Late during the 2010s, Sanchez started playing a character named Fausto Punetier during the radio and television show El Circo. Punetier represents an effeminate fashion designer who nevertheless does have a girlfriend.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK0mJQpfIXg  Other works  Sánchez also became a manager of other entertainers. Among the people he has managed is merengue singer, Giselle.  Personal life  Sanchez married with Nelva Rodríguez on June 4, 1983, after meeting her in college. They have three children: Francheska, Gabriel, and Anaís. Sánchez has been known for rarely commenting about his personal life. Sánchez enjoys fishing and is the owner of a Harley Davidson motorcycle.

It was originally called the Howard University Reservoir or the Washington City Reservoir, and was completed in 1902 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Scott, Pamela (2007), \\"Capital Engineers: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Development of Washington, D.C., 1790-2004.\\" p. 175. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Publication No. EP 870-1-67. The reservoir was built on the site of Smith Spring, one of the springs previously used for drinking water. Washington's earliest residents relied on natural springs but this came to be inadequate as the city's population grew. In 1850, Congress determined that the Potomac River should be the city's principal source of water. Construction history=Washington Aqueduct A Congressionally funded engineering study was conducted to determine the most available mode of supplying water to the city. Work and study conducted under the leadership of Lieutenant Montgomery C. Meigs culminated into the development of the Washington Aqueduct which began operations on January 3, 1859.Ways, Harry C. (1996), \\"The Washington Aqueduct: 1852-1992,\\" Baltimore, MD: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District. (Initially the system provided water to the city from the Little Falls Branch in Maryland, until the aqueduct construction was completed.) Regular water service from the Potomac River source through the aqueduct commenced in 1864. Washington City Tunnel In the early years of operation the water was routed through the system's two earlier-built reservoirs, Dalecarlia and Georgetown, which were designed to settle sediment out of the water. In 1873 the Army began construction of a new water supply tunnel, led by Garrett Lydecker, a major in the Army Corps of Engineers. The tunnel was known as the Washington City Tunnel, to provide more storage, sedimentation and distribution capacity for the system. Lydecker predicted the tunnel would cost about $53,000 to build. Construction of the tunnel was halted in the 1880s due to a variety of problems including funding shortages, cost overruns, bribery and fraud associated with the construction process. During that period some improvements were made to the Dalecarlia portion of the system, and work on the tunnel finally resumed in 1898. The tunnel was completed in 1901, after an additional $800,000 investment, and the McMillan Reservoir began operation in 1902. Filtration plant 250x250px All the District's water needs were thought to have been quenched by the water aqueduct system, but by 1902 it became apparent that it was no longer adequate. To handle population growth and municipal sanitation needs, officials added the McMillan Sand Filtration Site in 1905. This facility implemented an innovative water purification system relying on sand instead of chemicals to filter 75 million gallons (280 million liters) per day. It helped quell typhoid epidemics and other communicable diseases throughout the city. In 1907 the reservoir and filtration plant were named in honor of Senator James McMillan of Michigan, who chaired the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia and supported development of the water supply facilities. The Congress officially designated the site as a park in March 1911.United States.

Chapter 192, Public Law No. 441. 61st Congress, Session III. H. R. 31856. March 2, 1911. Subsequent improvements to the city water system were initiated beginning in the 1920s. The regular use of chlorine as a disinfectant began in 1923 at the McMillan filtration plant. Another treatment plant was completed in 1928, and this was built adjacent to the Dalecarlia Reservoir. The growth of the city population led to further expansions at the Dalecarlia site in the 1950s. McMillan Fountain The McMillan Fountain is a public artwork by American artist Herbert Adams located on the Reservoir grounds. The fountain, completed in 1912 and dedicated in October 1919, consists of a bronze The Three Graces placed upon a pink granite base. Cast by Roman Bronze Works, the fountain was originally part of a large landscape setting designed by Charles A. Platt. A tribute to James McMillan, the fountain was paid for by citizens of Michigan, who raised $25,000 by way of pennies, nickels and dimes donated by public school children. Congress also funded totaling $15,000 towards the completion.Somma, Thomas P. \\"The McMillan Memorial Fountain: A Short History of a Lost Monument\\", Washington History, Vol 14, No. 2, pp. 96-107. Recent developments In 1941, citing security concerns, the entire site was permanently closed and fenced off due to fear of sabotage. The property remained closed to the public, but supplied the city with filtered water into the 1980s. In 1986, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decommissioned the site and declared it surplus. The old water treatment site was purchased by the District of Columbia from the federal government in 1987 for $9.3 million, and since has deteriorated due to lack of maintenance. The question of what to do with the property is up for debate. The 25 acre (100,000 m²) McMillan Reservoir, located between Michigan Avenue, North Capitol Street, and First Street in Northwest Washington, D.C., was designated a DC Historic Landmark in 1991. In 2000, and again in 2005, it was placed on the \\"List of Most Endangered Properties.\\" In 2006, a request for quotation (RFQ) to redevelop the McMillan site was released with five responses being received by the D.C. government. In 2007, Vision McMillan Partners, composed of Trammell Crow Company, Jair Lynch Development Partners, and EYA, was selected as the winning bid. Friends of McMillan Park and Save McMillan Action Coalition, community organizations, generated local opposition and activism, leading to court action, delaying and preventing the project from beginning. In 2016, courts sided with community activists and rejected the DC Zoning Commission's approval of a $720 million project to transform the site into retail, office and residential space. The D.C. Court of Appeals cleared the $720 million project to commence in July 2019. Preliminary demolition work began in September 2019, being fiercely contested by opposition groups and protesters. In December 2019, a restraining order was filed to stop work on the site.

The series was written by Bruce Coville. I Left My Sneakers in Dimension X was first published in 1994. Plot summary I Left My Sneakers in Dimension X continues the adventures of Rod and the crew of the Galactic Patrol ship Ferkel. When villainous BKR's friend Smorkus Flinders crosses over from Dimension X, he captures Rod and his bratty cousin Elspeth, taking them back to his home to use as bait for the crew of the Ferkel as revenge for them imprisoning BKR. Rod and Elspeth are rescued by Captain Grakker and his crew, but during the escape from Castle Chaos, the Ferkel is damaged enough that all must abandon ship. Without their spacecraft, our heroes are stranded. Following the strange disappearance of their friend Snout, the seven remaining gain help in the form of Galuspa, one of the race of Shapeshifters that are native to Dimension X. With his help, they are taken to the Valley of the Shapeshifters to see the Ting Wongovia. During their journey, Rod gains a new companion: a furry little creature called a Chibling, which bonds to him. Also during this time, and the time spent waiting in the Valley, Rod sees that another of the crew, Tar Gibbons, is watching him. Later, the Tar asks Rod to become his \\"Krevlik\\", or apprentice. Rod accepts, and begins training under his new teacher in the ways of martial arts. During the wait, Rod learns that BKR was handed off to the Merkel, one of the Ferkel's sister ships, to be delivered to prison, and that the crew of the Ferkel readily jumped in to save them despite knowledge that they were headed into a trap. Finally, the Ting Wongovia agrees to see them. They find out that he is actually the egg brother of their missing comrade Snout, and that Smorkus Flinders was once a good person, but, when he was slightly older than Rod, he was caught in a horrific Reality Quake that permanently transformed him into a monster. Banished to the Valley of the Monsters, he became their king, but the Reality Quake's effects also drove him partially insane. They then learn the plans of Smorkus Flinders and BKR: they intend to create a permanent hole between Dimension X, home of the dangerous Reality Quakes, and Dimension Q, home of the planet Earth and the Galactic Patrol. This would cause the Reality Quakes to leak over to our world, and the two dimensions would eventually fuse into a single dimension where reality can shift like sand; Smorkus Flinders sees this plan as an opportunity to get revenge on life for what it did to him, while the sadistic BKR simply wants to make others suffer, even with the knowledge that the Reality Quakes will affect him just as much as anyone else. To stop him, the crew of the Ferkel are joined by the Shapeshifters, the Ting Wongovia, and (to their dismay) Elspeth. Returning to Castle Chaos (in part with help from Spar Kellis, a gigantic blue monster who works for the Ting Wongovia by spying on Smorkus Flinders), they make their stand.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book- reviews/bruce-coville/i-left-my-sneakers-in-dimension-x/ In the resulting confrontation, Rod is forced to grow to a gigantic height so he can defeat Smorkus Flinders. During the battle, he is contacted by Snout (by way of a direct telepathic link between the two), and learns that his old friend is being held captive by the \\"Ferkada\\". He also finds that Smorkus Flinders knows something about Rod's father. When Rod himself questions the monster, Smorkus Flinders cries out to ask BKR. About then, Rod blacks out. Soon after he wakes up, Rod learns that Smorkus Flinders is now their captive, and that when the Ferkel crashed into his room, they were really looking for another alien… his own father. With these revelations on his mind, Rod prepares to go home. But first, he winds up giving his new sneakers to Spar Kellis as a gift. But with all that has happened, telling his mother that he left his sneakers in Dimension X is the least of his worries.

It was written by Bruce Coville and first published in 1995. In the UK it was published under the title Aliens Stole My Dad, as 'snout' is British slang for tobacco Plot summary The Search For Snout picks up where the previous book left off. Introducing the crew of the Galactic Patrol vessel Ferkel to his earthling mother proves to be as difficult as predicted, and explaining that he's going with them to find his semi-alien father is an even harder task. But the real trouble starts when they find out that BKR (the pain-loving alien psycho antagonist) is on the loose, having taken control of the Ferkel's sister ship Merkel while the ship was delivering him to prison. The crew of the Ferkel has been ordered to seek out their enemy and recapture him. After they question Smorkus Flinders (a muscle-bound alien from Dimension X) and learn something of BKR's current plan, Rod is contacted again by his friend Snout, master of the mental arts. Partly inspired by this contact, Grakker (the ship's commander) decides to break off from the Galactic Patrol and head for the Mentat instead, the school where Snout became a master of the Mental Arts (incidentally, the building is one big PLANT). There, he hopes to find a clue that could lead them to their fallen friend. During the journey, Grakker reveals some of his past, including how he got to know both Snout and BKR. Smorkus Flinders, having escaped from his suspended animation pod, manages to capture the entire crew... except for Elspeth (Rod's all-human cousin), who stowed away and was also in suspended animation as punishment. She manages to stop Smorkus and rescue the others. Also as a result of the battle, Rod's chibling (a small furball from dimension X) is injured from being thrown into a wall. Later that night, Rod learns that his friend was forced into his third stage of life: a two-part animal. The first half, which is then named Seymour, resembles a squashed, hairless blue cat with four (later six) legs, a long tail, and a similar neck with a gigantic eyeball at one end. The other half is named Edgar, and looks the same as before. While both appear to have separate minds, Seymour is the half that is truly sentient, holding their shared brain in his body. Soon after, they arrive at the Mentat and meet with the 'Head' Council, who are unable to help. However, they do reveal that all the messages which came from Snout are, in part, due to a direct link between Rod's mind and Snout's, created by an incident involving direct brain-to-brain training in the first book. They also question Smorkus Flinders, and through him contact BKR. Though they cannot help in regard to the Ferkada that Snout mentioned, they do agree to try and cure Smorkus Flinders, reverting him from a monster to a Normal (the species he used to be until he was caught in a nasty Reality Quake and turned into a monster). Later that day, the Mentat's security force (led by an insectoid woman named Arly Bung) arrests Rod, Elspeth and the crew after being contacted by the Galactic Patrol. Imprisoned in the lowest regions of the Mentat, they are soon rescued by Selima Khan, another of Snout's kind who also attended the Mentat in his year. During their escape into the caves below the Mentat, Rod sees an ancient carving of his father. Selima Khan also reveals the plans of BKR and Smorkus Flinders: they intend to use a black hole to detonate a bomb that will disrupt the space-time continuum and eventually bring the flow of time itself to a complete stop, but require Rod's brain to do so, for an unknown reason. Later, he is contacted again and leaves the group to follow the message. Along with Seymour and Edgar, Rod winds up in the belly of a gigantic stone beast, and the trio journey deep into its bowels. Finally, they reach a chamber where Snout is laying, fading away into nothingness. But he is not alone, as Rod is reunited with his father (alias the Ferkada, one of the ancient founders of the Mentat) at last. Rod's father (Ah-Rit Alber Ite, or Arthur \\"Art\\" Allbright) reveals the truth about where he came from (the lost civilization of Atlantis, circa 35,000 years ago), and his personal history with BKR. He also reveals that he once fled with the crucial bit of information that BKR needs for his current plans and stored them in a safe place: Rod's brain. During this last part, BKR arrives with Smorkus Flinders, revealing part of his side of the story. He also arrives to get the information that he needs. Just in time, the Ferkel arrives as well, and the resulting battle ends with a stalemate: BKR has Ah-Rit in his grasp, and threatens to kill him if Rod (and the crucial information) aren't handed over to him. Fortunately, there's a solution. Ah-Rit is released to the Ferkel, while Rod is handed over to BKR, and Snout transfers the contents of Rod's mind (including the crucial information) into Seymour, resulting in two minds living in one body. After the swap, BKR leaves with Rod's body. Afterward, Snout (now fully recovered from his coma-like state) reveals exactly what happened to him after he vanished from Dimension X. He was probing the dimension for something, and connected with something extenuatingly hostile, possibly Smorkus Flinders himself.

This is the fourth book in a series about the fictional character Rod Albright. The illustrations and the front cover were done by the author's wife, Katherine Coville. Plot summary Aliens Stole My Body concludes the four-book series. After the departure of Selima Khan, the group characters from The Search for Snout splits up into three groups, Rod and Seymour head for the planet Kryndamar, along with Snout, Elspeth, and Madam Pong (the Diplomatic Officer of the Ferkel). Meanwhile, Grakker and Phil (the sentient plant who serves as the Ferkel's science officer) leave to re-establish contact with the Galactic Patrol, and Ah-Rit heads off with Tar Gibbons in an attempt to reclaim Rod's body from BKR. While on Kryndamar, Rod begins training his mind with Snout, and later gains a few new allies: the intergalactic pet trader Mir-Van; his family; and his business partner Grumbo. They also encounter one of BKR's henchmen; from him, they learn that BKR has already discovered their deception: Rod's brain is empty. BKR still plans to use it as bait, and he intends to capture Rod's mom and younger twin siblings from Earth, to serve as more bait. After arriving on Earth and locating Rod's family, the entire group (sans Grumbo, Mir-Van, and his family) are captured by BKR and his gang (including the traitorous Arly Bung) in the Merkel. The captives, along with Grakker, Phil, and Selima Khan, who are captured shortly before they were to leave the solar system, are taken to BKR's headquarters. There, the entire group is joined by Ah-Rit and Tar Gibbons. With all his enemies in one place, BKR delivers an ultimatum: reveal where they've hidden Rod's mind, or die. Rod tells Snout to send him back to his own body. Using the skills that he's learned from both Tar Gibbons and Snout, Rod is able to take out all of BKR's crew, and finally BKR himself. Following the defeat and capture of their enemies, Rod and his family are returned to Earth, though Rod will be able to return to space in the future. BKR and his gang are locked up and await trial. After a final goodbye to his teacher and friends, Rod watches as the Ferkel and its crew depart for GP headquarters so they can deliver BKR and his gang to stand trial. Ferkel and its crew must also stand trial, since they did break the law by going renegade instead of following orders.

A snare rush can vary in tempo considerably, from 16th notes even to 2048th notes. At that sort of speed, the effect is a buzzing sound, but with a detectable pitch, so some artists vary the repeat rate, and can even play a tune. One example of this would be the last 18 seconds of \\"Ghetto Body Buddy\\" by Venetian Snares, where the theme from Sesame Street is played using only extremely fast snare rushes. The defining characteristic of a snare rush, as opposed to a roll, is the sheer virtuosity it would take for a physical drummer to play a successful one. As such, almost all snare rushes are computer programmed and can be used with bass drums, tom-toms, and cymbals to intensify the effect. They are often used as fills, alongside complex programmed breakbeats. Snare rushes are also often run through analog or dsp effects together with variations in volume, such as a filters or pitch shifting. They are common in trance music, hard techno, gabber music, oldschool jungle, IDM, drill 'n bass, breakcore and glitch music. If human pitch perception begins at 20 Hz (1200 vibrations per minute), then 256th notes become pitched at ≈ 80 bpm.

His idiosyncratic brand of showmanship when performing and vocal vibrato led him to become a cult figure on the British rock scene. Chapman is claimed to have said that he was trying to sing like both Little Richard and his idol Ray Charles. Since the early 1980s he has spent much of his time in Germany and has made occasional appearances there and elsewhere. In Germany, he was awarded an Artist of the Year award during the 1980s, followed by a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004.  History  Chapman was originally the vocalist for Farinas, who released the single \\"You'd Better Stop\\" b/w \\"I Like It Like That\\" in August 1964. (However, lead vocals on that single were performed by Jim King.) He moved on to join The Roaring Sixties and were later renamed Family in 1966. In 1967 the first single was released, \\"Scene Through The Eye of a Lens\\", something of a psychedelic classic. Chapman wrote most of Family's songs with Charlie Whitney and their debut album Music in a Doll's House was released in 1968. Their bluesy, experimental rock music gained them a reputation as a progressive underground band. The release of Family Entertainment (1969), A Song for Me (1970) and Anyway (1970) established Family as a fast and loud rock band also capable of producing the most intense acoustic music, in the British underground music scene, at that time. Their single The Weaver's Answer from the Family Entertainment album was a hit in 1969. On 28 August 1970 they appeared at the third Isle of Wight Festival. Although the band was popular in UK and Europe, success in the US eluded them and in 1973 they broke up. Roger Chapman (1974) Chapman formed Chapman-Whitney with Whitney, late in 1973. They signed to the Vertigo label and recorded an album Chapman Whitney Streetwalkers (1974), with a line-up including other members of Family and King Crimson, as well as Nicko McBrain, now with Iron Maiden. Chapman and Whitney morphed their band into Streetwalkers, who were a polished album-oriented rock band who used more white soul than Family had. They released Downtown Flyers (1975), moving on to record the groove heavy album Red Card (1976)[ Red Card] John Dougan at Allmusic which was released in the UK in 1976 and remains a much respected album by music fans and the music press.British Hit Singles & Albums Two more albums followed before the band broke up in 1977, ending eleven years of the Whitney-Chapman musical partnership. In 1979 Chapman began a solo career and recorded his first solo album Chappo. His backing band became known as The Shortlist at this time and he toured Europe extensively. Mike Oldfield's song \\"Shadow on the Wall\\" from the album Crises (1983) featured Chapman on vocals and became a big hit. He appeared as a guest artist on the second Box of Frogs album Strange Land (1986) singing lead vocals on two songs. Chapman went on to record Walking the Cat (1989) and Hybrid and Low Down (1990). Since then Chapman has released eleven albums of new and live recordings. His album Hide Go Seek (2009) was produced by former Family bassist Jim Cregan and released during May 2009. His appearance on Saturday 21 August 2010 at the Rhythm Festival was billed as: \\"The farewell performance from Roger Chapman & The Shortlist\\".

His 2008 biography of Eratosthenes attracted scholarly attention. Author Nicholas Nicastro in 2012 Life and career Born in Astoria, New York in 1963, he received a BA in English from Cornell University (1985), an MFA in filmmaking from New York University (1991), an M.A. in archaeology and a Ph.D. in psychology from Cornell (1996 and 2003). He has also worked as a film critic, a hospital orderly, a newspaper reporter, a library archivist, a college lecturer in anthropology and psychology, an animal behaviorist, and an advertising salesman. His Cornell dissertation research on how humans respond to the vocalizations of domestic cats got some attention from the news media, especially in publications aimed at \\"cat people\\".http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May02/cat_talk.hrs.html (Press Release)http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2001913.stm Nicastro taught anthropology, psychology and writing at Cornell University and Hobart and William Smith Colleges. While active in research he published scholarly papers in Journal of Comparative Psychology, Evolutionary Anthropology, Behavioral & Brain Sciences, and American Journal of Archaeology.https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S9lQoMwAAAAJ&hl;=en&oi;=ao In 2005, he left academia to pursue writing full-time. Writings, reception, and awards Nicastro's writings include short fiction, travel and science articles in such publications as The New York Times, The New York Observer, Film Comment, and the International Herald Tribune. In 1996, he wrote and directed the documentary video Science or Sacrilege: Native Americans, Archaeology & the Law, an examination of the conflict between scientists and native people for control of ancient remains. The video was honored by the American Anthropological Association, the Northwest Anthropological Conference, and the American Society for Ethnohistory, and is currently distributed by Berkeley Media LLC. It is often shown in college courses on this subject. From 2006 to 2015, Nicastro served as film critic for Tompkins Weekly, a newspaper serving the greater Ithaca, NY area.http://www.tompkinsweekly.com Nicastro's ancient fiction, including Empire of Ashes and The Isle of Stone, is marked by a willingness to explore the dark underside of popular historical exploits. In Ashes, he presents the career of Alexander the Great from the angle of a skeptical Athenian soldier/historian who must debunk Alexander's official divinity to save himself from a charge of sacrilege. Classicist and expert in Alexander studies Prof. Jeanne Reames (Martin Professor of History, University of Nebraska) praised the book for \\"avoiding both apologetics and exaggerated sensationalism, making Empire of Ashes one of the best recent novels on the conqueror.”Book Review: Empire of Ashes by Nicholas Nicastro,\\" Amphora, American Philological Association, 6.1 (2007) Empire of Ashes was included in a list of all-time recommended historical novels by the Archaeological Institute of America. In Isle of Stone, Nicastro presents a portrait of ancient Sparta during the Peloponnesian War that departs from what classical historian Paul Cartledge calls \\"the Spartan mirage\\". Instead, he reveals both the roots and the consequences of practices that, some say, made Sparta the Western world's prototype of a totalitarian society. Cartledge himself has praised Isle of Stone, observing \\"Nicastro's antiheroes of the isle of Sphacteria are the dark side of [Stephen] Pressfield's heroes in Gates of Fire: both demand and repay the attention of all lovers of expert historical fiction.\\" His demythologizing approach has not been popular with all readers, however, drawing its share of negative reviews.http://www.crescentblues.com/8_1issue/bk_nicastro_ashes.shtml Nicastro published his first book-length work of non-fiction in 2008. Circumference: Eratosthenes and the Ancient Quest to Measure the Globe tells the story of the first man to measure the size of the Earth accurately. In a review, the Bryn Mawr Classical Review observed some scholarly inaccuracies, but noted overall \\"Given the paucity of material in English on Eratosthenes, anything is a welcome addition, but this book is much better than nothing. In its pages, historians of science will learn much about the ancient world, and historians of the ancient world will learn much about science.\\"T. E.

He was once said to be \\"probably the only geodesist who would have deserved a Nobel prize\\" Helmut Moritz and M. I. Yurkina (eds.), \\"M. S. Molodensky in Memoriam\\", Mitteilungen der geodätischen Institute der Technischen, Universität Graz, Folge 88, Graz, 2000, He graduated from Moscow State University (1936), since 1946 he worked for the Institute of Earth Physics (Институт Физики Земли АН СССР). He created an original theory for determining the figure of the Earth and its gravity field based on measurements done on the topographic surface, built the first Soviet gravimeter, developed a theory of the nutation of Earth. He won the Stalin Prize (1946 and 1951) and the Lenin Prize (1961). His legacy includes the Molodensky transformations, which are commonly used to transform between geodetic datums. His main work (since 1932) was on the figure of the Earth (the geoid) and her exterior gravity field or geopotential. His aim was to develop hypothesis-free methods for determining both the gravity field and defining vertical reference systems for large areas. As part of this work, he introduced normal heights, which can be calculated from geopotential numbers (obtained from precise levelling) without needing the uncertain value of gravity along the plumbline of a point, i.e., inside the continental crustal rock under the point.M. S. Molodenskii and V. F. Eremeev and M. I. Yurkina, \\"Methods for the Study of the External Gravitational Field and Figure of the Earth\\" (transl. from Russian), Israel Program of Scientific Translations, Jerusalem Corresponding to this new height concept is the concept of the telluroid, the collection of points Q the normal potential of which is equal to the true potential of a point P on the terrain, and on the same plumb line. The separation between points P and Q, i.e., between topographic and telluroid surfaces, is called the height anomaly, and is, contrary to the geoid undulation N, defined throughout space, not only at sea level. Over time, Molodenskii's theoretical work has found recognition as more and more countries are adopting normal heights for their national height systems. As a compromise to traditional thinking, the concept of quasi-geoid has been introduced, being a surface separated from the reference ellipsoid by precisely an amount equal to the height anomaly evaluated on the topography. Then, the traditional connection between orthometric heights H and ellipsoidal heights h, h = H+N, is preserved as h = H^* + \\\\zeta , where \\\\zeta is the height anomaly (or \\"quasi-geoid height\\"), and H^* is normal height.

One version was published in Thomas D'Urfey's Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy; a very different one appeared in George Farquhar's 1706 play The Recruiting Officer. A version also appears in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera of 1728. The words have changed over the years, as can be seen in the versions below. The only consistent element in early versions is the title line and the tune. D'Urfey's and Gay's versions both refer to lovers, while Farquhar's version refers to fleeing overseas to join the army. The tune was provided with another set of lyrics for the British Sharpe television series of the 1990s, based on Farquhar's version. This version was also recorded by John Tams who played Dan Hagman in the series. The nursery rhyme \\"Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son\\" mentions a piper who knows only one tune, this one. Early versions of this, known as \\"The distracted Jockey's Lamentations\\", may have been written (but not included) in Thomas D'Urfey's play The Campaigners (1698): :Tommy was a Piper's Son, :And fell in love when he was young; :But all the Tunes that he could play, :Was, o'er the Hills, and far away. Another nursery rhyme \\"Five Little Ducks\\" uses the title of the song as a line. An instrumental version was heard in the Barney & Friends episode \\"Classical Cleanup\\". D'Urfey lyrics :Jocky met with Jenny fair :Aft by the dawning of the day; :But Jockey now is fu' of care :Since Jenny staw his heart away. :Altho' she promis'd to be true :She proven has, alake! unkind :Which gars poor Jockey aften rue :That e'er he loo'd a fickle mind. ::Tis o'er the hills and far away ::Tis o'er the hills and far away ::Tis o'er the hills and far away ::The wind has blown my plaid away [verses omitted] :Since that she will nae pity take :I maun gae wander for her sake :And, in ilk wood and gloomy grove :I'll, sighing, sing,\\" Adieu to love. :Since she is fause whom I adore :I'll never trust a woman more; :Frae a' their charms I'll flee away :And on my pipes I'll sweetly play,\\" ::O'er hills and dales and far away ::O'er hills and dales and far away ::O'er hills and dales and far away ::The wind has blawn my plad away. George Farquhar lyrics A version of the lyrics by George Farquhar for his play The Recruiting Officer from 1706. :Our 'prentice Tom may now refuse :To wipe his scoundrel Master's Shoes, :For now he's free to sing and play :Over the Hills and far away. :Over the Hills and O'er the Main, :To Flanders, Portugal and Spain, :The queen commands and we'll obey :Over the Hills and far away. :We all shall lead more happy lives :By getting rid of brats and wives :That scold and brawl both night and day – :Over the Hills and far away. :Over the Hills and O'er the Main, :To Flanders, Portugal and Spain, :The queen commands and we'll obey :Over the Hills and far away. :Courage, boys, 'tis one to ten, :But we return all gentlemen :While conquering colours we display, :Over the hills and far away. :Over the Hills and O'er the Main, :To Flanders, Portugal and Spain, :The queen commands and we'll obey :Over the Hills and far away. John Gay lyrics In The Beggar's Opera the song is a duet between the antihero Macheath and his lover Polly. It is a romantic dream of escape, with no military references. MACHEATH: :Were I laid on Greenland's Coast, :And in my Arms embrac'd my Lass; :Warm amidst eternal Frost, :Too soon the Half Year's Night would pass. POLLY: :Were I sold on Indian Soil, :Soon as the burning Day was clos'd, :I could mock the sultry Toil :When on my Charmer's Breast repos'd. MACHEATH: :And I would love you all the Day, POLLY: :Every Night would kiss and play, MACHEATH: :If with me you'd fondly stray POLLY: :Over the Hills and far away John Tams lyrics This is the version that is used in the Sharpe television series with lyrics written by John Tams. Note that each verse is from a different story, as noted at the start of the verse. Chorus: :O'er the hills and o'er the main :Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain. :King George commands and we obey :Over the hills and far away. From Sharpe's Eagle & Sharpe's Mission: :Here's forty shillings on the drum :To those who volunteer to come, :To 'list and fight the foe today :Over the Hills and far away. From Sharpe's Company: :Through smoke and fire and shot and shell, :And to the very walls of hell, :But we shall stand and we shall stay :Over the hills and far away From Sharpe's Enemy: :Though I may travel far from Spain :A part of me shall still remain, :And you are with me night and day :and Over the hills and far away. From Sharpe's Honour & Sharpe's Siege: :Then fall in lads behind the drum :With colours blazing like the sun. :Along the road to come what may :Over the hills and far away. From Sharpe's Gold: :When Evil stalks upon the land :I'll neither hold nor stay me hand :But fight to win a better day, :Over the hills and far away. From Sharpe's Battle: :If I should fall to rise no more, :As many comrades did before, :Ask the fifes and drums to play :Over the hills and far away. From Sharpe's Sword: :Let kings and tyrants come and go, :I'll stand adjudged by what I know. :A soldiers life I'll ne'er gainsay. :Over the hills and far away. From Sharpe's Challenge: :Though kings and tyrants come and go :A soldier's life is all I know :I'll live to fight another day :Over the hills and far away. No version of the song accompanies Sharpe's Rifles, Sharpe's Regiment, Sharpe's Revenge and Sharpe's Justice. A tongue-in-cheek verse appears in Sharpe's Waterloo: :Old Wellington, he scratched his bum. :He says, \\"Boney lad, thee's had thee fun.\\" :My riflemen will win the day :Over the hills and far away. Dan Hagman quietly sings the first verse to Perkins when he was dying from getting bayoneted by a Spanish-Irish traitor, O'Rourke, in Sharpe's Battle. Tams' recorded version Tams recorded a variation of the above lyrics for Over the Hills & Far Away: The Music of Sharpe, the companion CD to the television film series. The song was also recorded by New Zealand singer Will Martin on his debut 2008 album New World. The lyrics for that version go :Here's forty shillings on the drum :For those who volunteer to come, :To 'list and fight the foe today :Over the Hills and far away [Chorus] :O'er the hills and o'er the main :Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain :King George commands and we obey :Over the hills and far away : :When duty calls me I must go :To stand and face another foe :But part of me will always stray :Over the hills and far away [Chorus] :If I should fall to rise no more :As many comrades did before :Then ask the fifes and drums to play :Over the hills and far away [Chorus] :Then fall in lads behind the drum :With colours blazing like the sun :Along the road to come what may :Over the hills and far away [Chorus] X4 See also *Over the Hills & Far Away: The Music of Sharpe References * * Further reading * Category:British patriotic songs Category:English folk songs Category:Sharpe series Category:Canadian military marches Category:17th-century songs Category:18th-century songs ","title":"Over the Hills and Far Away (traditional song)"},{"id":"3775818","text":"The Tyrone Constitution, High Street, Omagh, January 2010 The Tyrone Constitution is a newspaper based in Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.

Life Lidderdale was born to British parents at the British Chaplaincy in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and was educated at Birkenhead in Cheshire. After working for the Russian merchants Heath and Co, he joined the Liverpool merchant house of Rathbone Brothers, working in their New York City office from 1857 to 1863. He was made a partner in 1864, and went on to establish the firm's London office. He became a Bank of England director in 1870, becoming Deputy Governor in 1887, and Governor in 1889. Lidderdale's period in office is notable for his handling of the Barings crisis, cause of the 'Panic of 1890'. Barings became over-extended in underwriting Argentine debt, the value of which strongly declined following political unrest in Buenos Aires, and the recognition of the inefficient use of borrowed funds. Lidderdale organized a successful consortium to rescue the bank. In recognition, he was granted the Freedom of the City of London and was made a member of the British Privy Council. He lived at Ascot Place at North Ascot in Winkfield, Berkshire. Lidderdale, who became a commissioner of the Patriotic Fund in 1893, and held (among other financial offices) the presidency of the council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders.

It is sold in both home and corporate packages, of which there are editions for Windows and Linux. There are corporate versions for Microsoft Exchange, Solaris, and certain IBM eServers. The Linux version is available to home users free of charge, with virus definition updates. Free 30-day trial versions for other platforms can be downloaded. F-Prot AVES is specifically targeted towards corporate users. The company has also produced a genealogy program called Espólínnamed after Jón Espólín, an 18th-century magistrate of Snæfellsnes. and Púki, a spellchecker with additional features. In Summer of 2012, FRISK was acquired by Cyren, an Israeli-American provider of security products.  F-Prot Antivirus  F-Prot Antivirus (stylized F-PROT) is an antivirus product developed by FRISK Software International. It is available in related versions for several platforms. It is available for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Exchange Server, Linux, Solaris, AIX and IBM eServers. FRISK Software International allows others to develop applications using their scanning engine, through the use of a SDK. Many software vendors use the F-Prot Antivirus engine, including SUSE. CYREN announced July 31st 2021 as the end- of-life date for F-Prot Antivirus.  Friðrik Skúlason  Friðrik Skúlason, also sometimes known as \\"Frisk\\", is the founder of FRISK Software International and one of the founding members of CARO (Computer Antivirus Research Organization). He originally developed F-Prot Antivirus while doing computer support work. He was, for many years, the technical editor of the Virus Bulletin. Skúlason served as the head of FRISK Software International until its eventual acquisition by Cyren in 2012, after which he joined Cyren as the vice-president of Antivirus technologies.

The Female Eunuch. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 295. was a second-wave radical feminist group active in New York City from 1968 to 1973. History The group was founded in 1968 as a split from the New York City chapter of National Organization for Women (NOW) by members who felt NOW was not radical enough. It was originally called the ' after the date that it was founded, but soon changed its name to The Feminists.Willis, Ellen (1992). No More Nice Girls: Countercultural Essays. Wesleyan University Press, p. 124\\\\. Ti-Grace Atkinson was the group's central figure and informal leader until she left the group in 1971;Willis, p. 140: \\"When the group decided that no member could talk to the media unless chosen by lot, Atkinson quit.\\" other prominent members included Anne Koedt (who left in 1969 to co-found New York Radical Feminists), Sheila Michaels, Barbara Mehrhof, Pamela Kearon, and Sheila Cronan. The Feminists' best-known action may have been in September 1969, when members picketed the New York City Marriage License Bureau, distributing pamphlets protesting the marriage contract: > \\"All the discriminatory practices against women are patterned and > rationalized by this slavery-like practice. We can't destroy the inequities > between men and women until we destroy marriage.\\"Morgan, Robin, ed., > Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From the Women's Liberation > Movement (N.Y.: Random House, 1st ed. 1970), p. 537. Views According to Germaine Greer in The Female Eunuch (1970), The Feminists promoted not having leaders in society, \\"characterized men as the enemy,\\" described \\"Love\\" as \\"the response of the victim to the rapist\\", and believed that \\"the proprietary relationship of marriage\\" and uterine pregnancy would \\"no longer prevail.\\" The Feminists held that women were oppressed by their internalization of patriarchal sex roles, and hence suffered from a kind of false consciousness. To liberate themselves from such oppressive roles, The Feminists held that the feminist movement must be entirely autonomous from men and eventually came to hold that women should be free of men in their personal lives as well. The group was strongly opposed to the sexual revolution, holding that it was simply a way for men to get easier access to women's bodies. Ti-Grace Atkinson was one of the first radical feminists to be specifically critical of pornography. They at first advocated that women practice celibacy, and later came to advocate political lesbianism. The separatist ideas of The Feminists were reflected in their membership quota, restricting women who lived with men to one-third of its members, and excluding married women entirely in 1971. After Atkinson's departure, The Feminists moved in the direction of advocating matriarchy and developing a \\"woman's religion\\", ideas that later came to be known as cultural feminism. Although The Feminists disbanded in 1973, they played an important role in the development of cultural feminism, separatist feminism, and anti-pornography feminism (Barbara Mehrhof later became an organizer for Women Against Pornography), tendencies that were predominant in radical feminism by the late 1970s.

Opened in 1992, it was the second high school in the Bonneville School District. The school mascot is the Knight and the colors are red, black, and white. Hillcrest competed in IHSAA Class 5A for athletics until 2018, and now completes in 4A. The principal is Scott Miller. School history The West Entrance to Hillcrest High SchoolIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, overcrowding at Bonneville High School and a rising population in the southern end of Bonneville School District #93 proved a need for a second school within the district's boundaries. The passage of a bond issue in 1990 in the amount of $10,880,000 provided the financial means for constructing Hillcrest High School, along with Iona Elementary School and a major addition to Falls Valley Elementary School. Students started classes in August 1992 in grades nine through twelve. Some areas were not completed when the school opened, including the gym. The property adjoins the property of Sandcreek Middle School and makes an acceptable middle school/high school campus configuration. Academics Hillcrest offers a variety off scholastic opportunities for students. The school offers foreign language courses in German, Italian, Spanish, and French. It also offers 7 different Advanced Placement classes: Calculus, Statistics, U.S. Government, U.S. History, Economics, English Literature, and English Composition. Hillcrest also affords students the opportunity to participate in vocational/technical courses in conjunction with Bonneville High School and Eastern Idaho Technical College. These courses include drafting, woodworking, metalworking, electronics, auto body, auto tech, welding, cabinet making, robotics, family science, and a Certified Nursing Program. Hillcrest sponsors an ACT preparation course in the spring and fall. In 2006-2007, Hillcrest had a graduation rate of 98.39%, above that of their district average (97.41%) and the national average (about 70%). The student teacher ratio is 21, a little above the state average of 18. Building Hillcrest High School is composed of an upper and lower gym, cafeteria/commons, media center, vocational and regular classrooms, having approximately . The building has a maximum student capacity of approximately 1200 students. The structure is a prefabricated metal structure. The music, speech, and drama rooms are separated from the other academic areas, as is the vocational wing. Hillcrest High School is built on . The property is relatively flat, with good draining into the improved parking lot area, which further meets all United States Environmental Protection Agency requirements by draining into a lower softball field area. A new, $5.3 million auditorium was completed in August 2007 and officially opened October 15 of that same year. The auditorium, called the Performing Arts Center (PAC) at Hillcrest, seats 883. The first performance in the PAC was a play called Our Town, put on by Hillcrest January 28–30, 2008, followed by a musical called Camelot on April 14–16, 2008. Hillcrest High School also constructed a new tennis court, softball field, art room, drama room, debate room, and weight room.

The playhouse opened on 24 September 1827.Bowen's picture of Boston. 1838 History In the early part of the 19th Century, Boston was still a small town, not yet the bustling metropolis it is today.

The owners tried to bring in patrons by booking big- name performers. These included Junius Brutus Booth, Charlotte Cushman, George Washington Dixon, Fanny Elssler, Edwin Forrest, John Gilbert, Charles and Fanny Kemble, and Thomas D. Rice.

The special focus is targeted on the simulation of clinical processes with virtual patients. Virtual patients combine scientific excellence, modern technologies and the innovative concept of game- based learning. Virtual patients allow the learner to take the role of a health care professional and develop clinical skills such as making diagnoses and therapeutic decisions. Virtual patients have also been considered computer-based simulations designed to complement clinical training. The use of virtual patient programmes is increasing in healthcare, partly in response to increasing demands on health care professionals and education of students but also because they allow opportunity for students to practice in a safe environment. There are many different formats a virtual patient may take. However the overarching principle is that of interactivity—a virtual patient will have mechanisms for the learner to interact with the case and material or information is made available to the learner as they complete a range of learning activities. Interactivity is often included with questions, specific decision-making tasks, text-composition etc. and is non-sequential. Most systems provide quantitative and qualitative feedback. Forms Virtual patients may take a number of different forms: *Case Presentation: review of patient related cases to reinforce and apply primary medical concepts to real world situations. *Interactive Patient Scenario: multimedia patient case designed to teach clinical reasoning skills such as diagnostic test ordering and interpretation. *Virtual Patient Game: interactive clinical scenarios that take place in an entirely virtual world designed to practice team training in high risk situations (e.g. avatars within a virtual health facility). *Virtual Reality Scenarios: virtual reality based training exercises to teach procedural skills in situations of varying complexities. (e.g. virtual reality surgical simulation). *High Fidelity Software Simulation: computer programs designed to allow the mimicking of human physiological conditions for a variety of clinical scenarios. *High Fidelity Manikin: realistic, programmable manikins that are capable of simulating a wide range of clinical scenarios; including simulating cardiac arrest, seizure, etc. complete with simulated, real-time vitals. *Virtual Standardized Patient: an artificially intelligent patient designed with natural language capabilities to assist in training provider-patient communication skills. Types of interactions A number of different modes of virtual patient delivery have been defined: *Predetermined scenario [directed mode] *The learner may build up the patient or case data from observations and interactions [blank mode] *The learner may view and appraise or review an existing patient or scenario [critique mode or rehearsal mode] *The VP may be used as a mechanism to address particular topics [context mode] *The learner may use a scenario or patient to explore personal/professional dimensions [reflective mode] *Banks of patients or scenarios may collectively address broad issues of healthcare [pattern mode] Possible benefits Virtual patients have been shown to be a time-efficient and cost-effective method of developing clinical reasoning skills in students through independent and repeated practice of physician tasks in a safe environment without the risk of harm to the patient or learner, which can significantly increase the mental pool of learned cases in students. Unlike simulated or real patients, virtual patients can be accessed on demand, and the user may monitor a case over several months while spending less than an hour in real-time. Furthermore, virtual patients can be endlessly replayable and can be easily modified to allow the user to explore different clinical scenarios and patient outcomes. In comparison to simulated patients, virtual patients can also be used as a method of standardized assessment that minimizes variance. Despite their efficacy, simulated patients are still a tangent and prosthesis to reality. They should be viewed as educational tools that augment existing modes and methods of clinical teaching. Over-reliance on hypothetical \\"average\\" models has been criticized for not teaching medical students to identify the significant amount of normal variation seen in the real world. Data standards The MedBiquitous consortium established a working group in 2005 to create a free and open data standard for expressing and exchanging virtual patients between different authoring and delivery systems. This was in part to address the problem of exchanging and reusing virtual patients and in part to encourage and support easier and wider use of virtual patients in general. This standard has been very successful and is now widely adopted, e.g. in major projects like eViP. In 2010, this standard attained status as an ANSI standard.

It is thought to have been built shortly after the 1066 invasion of England by William the Conqueror. History=From the eleventh to the thirteenth centuryConstruction and development= The ruins of the shell keep in front of the later tower keep Floor plan of the castle keep The great hall on the first floor of the keep After the Battle of Hastings in 1066 William led his army to Canterbury and then sacked towns along the Pilgrims' Way, including Guildford. Later William, or one of his barons, built Guildford Castle. There is no record of it in the Domesday Book so construction probably started after 1086. First to be built at the Castle would have been the motte (a mound) around which was a ditch and a bailey protected by a wooden palisade. The bailey's boundary would have run along Castle Street, South Hill, what is now Racks Close and parallel with Quarry Street (although slightly to the east). If it followed a typical Norman design the bailey would have been divided with a palisade,\\"The bailey was probably divided into an inner and outer bailey, partly along the line of the path between the Bowling Green and the castle grounds\\" into two parts the outer and inner bail. The inner bailey would have encompassed the motte on which a wooden keep would have been built as a look-out post for the soldiers stationed there. Late 11th or early 12th century, a wall made of Bargate stone was built around the top of the motte creating what is known as a shell keep, and then around the 1130s a keep (tower) was added, again made of Bargate stone from nearby Godalming bonded with hard and durable mortar.Bargate stone from the Godalming area, as it is stronger than the local chalk\\". The keep may have been built over part of the shell keep and its foundations went down to the chalk bedrock. The general form was quadrangular, its exterior dimensions being by . The walls are about thick at the base and taper towards the top. The keep had a ground and first floor with the entrance located in the first floor to aid in defence. The keep was most likely used as a private apartment for the King. The ground floor was windowless. On the first floor there was a main chamber, a chapel, and wardrobe with latrine. A second floor was added shortly afterwards containing a two-seater latrine. The addition of the second floor made the keep over high. The roof of the building was made of lead and the inner walls were covered in plaster and then whitewashed. In the 12th century the King moved to better apartments located in the bailey. The main bailey buildings would have included a great hall, apartments for the King and Queen and their chapels. The great hall is thought to have been located at the site of the two houses at the bottom of Castle Hill and was made of stone. Henry III made a number of improvements in the 13th century which resulted in the castle being known as a palace. The Queen's apartment was improved with large new windows and two marble columns were added. The great hall was decorated with coloured glass windows and paintings. King Henry had his room painted green with gold and silver stars and he also built a garden surrounded by marble columns. A fire damaged the hall in 1254 but the changes to the buildings continued. Henry purchased some extra land in 1254 to extend the bailey so allow him to build a set of room for Edward, his son and heir to the throne, which were completed in 1246. The gate at Quarry Street was completed in 1256 which suggests that Henry made changes to the castle but no evidence of the previous gate (thought to have been opposite Tunsgate) remains. =Military use= The castle was mainly used as a royal residence but it was also a fortress and did play a part in warfare and although the Castle was never attacked it was strengthened at various points in its history. The keep is thought to have been heightened during the civil war which took place during Stephen's reign (1135–1154) and during the rebellion of Henry II's sons (the revolt of 1173–1174) the castle was strengthened. On 9 July 1216 Prince Louis took possession of the castle during the First Barons' War against King John, but the castle was not a scene of conflict. During the rebellion of Simon de Montfort in the 1260s there was no fighting either. However King Henry III's son Prince Edward (the future Edward I) did capture a rebel named Adam Gurdon in a battle at Alton and brought him to Guildford Castle and it was used as a mustering point during King Edward I's foreign wars. =Constables and sheriffs= In 1218 (the 10th year of the reign of Henry III), William de Coniers was constable of the castle; Cites: M Rot. Pat. 10 Hen. III. m. 1. Dugdale, Baronage, vol. ii. p. 291.The years are given as an approximation of the year of the reign which is used in the sources. For example King Edward II's reign started on 7 July 1307, so the first year of his reign was from 7 July 1307 to 6 July 1308. in the 39th of the same reign (1247), that office was held by Elias de Maunsel; Cites: Placit. Coron. ap. Bermondsey, Crast Trin. 39 Hen. III. Rot 26, dors and in Henry's 51st year (1259), the custody of the castle was in trusted to William de Aguillon, the then sheriff of Surrey; probably, in order that it might be used for a prison. Cites: Rot. Pip. 51 and 52 Hen. III. m. 30. In 1307 (the 35th year of the reign of Edward I) Edward de Say, the keeper of the King's prisoners had orders to repair the prison. In 1322 (the 15th year of the reign of Edward II), Oliver de Burdegala was governor.\\"'Oliverus de Burdegala, pro munitione castri de Guldeford, &c.; [mandatum est constabulano] Mich, brevia retornab.' Madox's Hist. Exchequer\\". In 1337 Sir John de Brocas was made constable. In 1367 (the 41st year of the reign of Edward III), it was given to Andrew Sackville, sheriff of Surrey and Sussex both for a prison and as a dwelling. Cites: M Rot. Pat. 41mo. Edw. III. pars 2, m. 19. In 1377 (In the 1st year of the reign of Richard II) Sir Simon Burleigh (who had been tutor to Richard), was constable. From the fourteenth to the twentieth century Guildford, along with some other royal inland castles, was no longer needed for defence and were neglected. From the 1360s a royal moated hunting lodge (situated on the other side the river from the castle) was improved and enlarged, so royalty chose to stay there when visiting the area rather than the castle. The royal apartments at the castle were neglected and by 1379 only the King's great chamber remained, the rest of the royal apartments having decayed beyond repair. This castle keep continued to be used as the common gaol for both Surrey and Sussex until 1487 (in the third year of the reign of Henry VII), when the inhabitants of Sussex petitioned parliament that the prisoners be moved to Lewes, which had a more secure establishment and location. The petition was granted. Cites Rot. Pari. vol. vi. p. 388. In 1544 John Daborne was made keeper of the castle garden. His family were involved with the castle for the rest of the 16th century and is thought to have been they who added the brick windows and fireplaces. In 1611 the castle estate was granted to Francis Carter by James I. In the 1630s, once the tower's roof was removed, it was used as a cockpit. Areas of the castle grounds were used for farming and rented out to various people. Around 1820 the Duke of Norfolk purchased it. In 1885 Lord Grantley of Wonersh, who owned a large part of the castle, sold it to the Guildford Corporation. The tower and walls were restored and opened to the public as pleasure gardens in 1888 to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee of the previous year. Twenty-first century Alice Through the Looking Glass in the castle grounds The surrounding moat is now occupied by gardens The gardens are \\"extremely popular, displaying an amazing array of colourful bedding, centred on the 11th Century Castle Keep\\", and include a life-size statue of Alice Through the Looking Glass, which is a memorial to Lewis Carroll who stayed nearby in The Chestnuts, his sisters' house, from 1868 until he died in 1898. Starting in 2003 there was a year-long conservation project. The keep was partially renovated, and the first floor was floored and roofed. During this project which ended in 2004 original features such as crenellations were found to still exist. The keep now contains a visitor centre, open between April and September, that includes written panels describing the history of the castle and a model of the place as it appeared in about 1300.

The school colors are orange and black and its teams are the Tigers; the mascot is known as Teeger. History As the oldest high school in the city of Idaho Falls, IFHS was established in 1897.\\"History of the Idaho Falls High School\\", The Idaho Register, 21 December 1906. Courtesy of the Museum of Idaho. The first building was a three-story structure on the corner of North Water and Walnut Street, behind what would later become O. E. Bell Junior High School. Following the construction of a larger building that occupied the entire block between 6th and 7th Streets and S. Boulevard and South Lee Avenue (where the Wesley W. Deist Aquatic Center is presently located), the original school building became the school district administration building and was also used for overflow classrooms as part of O.E. Bell Jr. High. It was later razed and is now part of the parking lot behind the present O.E. Bell office building. When the current campus on South Holmes Avenue opened in 1952, the building on 7th Street became Central Junior High School, which burned down on April 24, 1973.http://www.bonnevilleheritage.com/MJFCODPg.php?pag=chap10 The Civic Auditorium was concurrently constructed by the city in 1952, adjacent to the then-new Idaho Falls High School, and remains a major center for performing arts in the area.

The school opened in 1968 on the west side of Idaho Falls, west of the Snake River. The school colors are navy blue, white, and Columbia blue, and the mascot is a grizzly.  History  Skyline was the second high school established in Idaho Falls and the third in the Idaho Falls area after Bonneville High School. The Skyline classes of 1967 and 1968 were both originally part of Idaho Falls High School. Skyline High School was created in the fall of 1966, but due to incomplete construction, neither of the first two graduating classes (1967 or 1968) actually attended classes at the high school. Those students attended split sessions at Idaho Falls High School during both the 1966–67 and 1967–68 school years. IFHS students attended school in the morning, and Skyline students attended in the afternoon. The Class of 1969 was the first to attend and graduate from the new building. The first principal of Skyline was Richard Bigelow. The school was originally planned to be built on the east side of Idaho Falls, on Sunnyside Road, where the majority of the students lived. However, due to immense protests by residents on the west side of town, the school was built on the west side. When Skyline was completed, it was thought of as the \\"country\\" school, because it was located away from the populated area. In the following decades the town grew to surround the high school. It was named after Skyline Drive, a major artery in Idaho Falls that ran from the Idaho Falls Airport to the edge of the high school. The street was named in the early 1950s by Margaret Cope Johns who with her husband Merritt Miller Johns developed the Johns Addition. In 2012, The Idaho Falls School District #91 made a change to the high school. Clair E. Gale Jr. High did not have the students to stay open. The district made Clair E. Gale into a Magnet High School, called Compass Academy. This caused the freshman to be moved into the high school. Skyline High School and Idaho Falls High School now serve 9 to 12. The changed caused Eagle Rock and Taylorview Jr. High to become middle schools. The borders were also changed. The district is still adjusting to the changes, as both high schools are having crowding issues now.  Athletics  Skyline competes in athletics in IHSAA Class 4A,. It is currently a member of the High Country Conference (4A), competing against Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Preston, Century, Hilcrest, Bonneville, and Blackfoot.  Rivals  Skyline's rival is Idaho Falls High School (IFHS); the two share an outdoor football and track stadium adjacent to IFHS. The stadium is called Ravsten Stadium in honor of the first coach of Skyline, who had transferred from Idaho Falls. Each year the two rivals face off in a game of football to decide the color of the goal posts at Ravsten Stadium (orange for Idaho Falls, or blue for Skyline). The event has come to be known as the Emotion Bowl, The rivalry between the two schools became very intense, and even garnered national attention. Local officials saw the need to lessen the intensity somewhat. This was accomplished by rescheduling the final game of the year, which had traditionally been between the two schools, and on a Saturday afternoon. Placing the game within the regular season had the calming effect that the officials were looking for. However, in 2014 the game was moved back to the last Saturday of the high school football season. The stadium is also open to many other regional schools such as: Highland, Pocatello, Blackfoot, Rigby, Madison, and local teams Bonneville and Hillcrest.

Stadium trucks are distinct from other types of off-road R/C vehicles, such as buggies and short course trucks, by their combination of truck-style bodies and open-wheeled layout. The construction of most manufacturers' stadium trucks, are similar to those of buggies. Most feature wheels and tires that are both larger in diameter and wider for increased ground clearance and improved handling and stability. The chassis of most electric powered models is constructed of plastic or a fiber/plastic composite while internal combustion powered models typically have chassis made of aluminum.http://www.angelfire.com/mi/mikem/carstadium.html Their appearance loosely resembles that of full scale trophy trucks and short-course trucks. The primary difference is that the tires and suspension components extend far outboard of the body, similar to open wheel race cars. Short course trucks, a similar type of R/C car, much more closely resemble full-size trophy trucks. Although stadium trucks have no direct full-size counterpart, their name refers to types of full-size R/C vehicles that are raced on a closed circuit or stadium rather than a long, outdoor road course.

The Royal Society of Victoria (RSV) is the oldest scientific society in the state of Victoria in Australia. Foundation In 1854 two organisations formed with similar aims and membership, these being The Philosophical Society of Victoria (founded 15 June, 1854, inaugural president Andrew Clarke) and The Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science (founded 12 August, 1854, inaugural president Justice Sir Redmond Barry). These two merged in July 1855 to form the Philosophical Institute of Victoria, with Clarke as the inaugural president. The Philosophical Institute received Royal Charter in 1859, and the first president of the freshly renamed Royal Society of Victoria was Ferdinand von Mueller (later Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller), then Victoria's Government Botanist. In 1860 the RSV organised the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition under the Presidency of Victorian Governor Sir Henry Barkly. Activities Wood engraving published in The illustrated Australian news, depicting a public demonstration of new technology at the Royal Society of Victoria (Melbourne, Australia) on 8 August 1878. The Society has played an important role in the life of Melbourne and Victoria, including a foundational relationship with the Melbourne Museum, the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, the Melbourne Observatory and Victoria's National Parks. The Society convened the first Australian Antarctic Exploration Committee in 1885, commissioned the Burke and Wills expedition and established the Victorian Institute of Marine Sciences in 1978 (now the Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute from 1996). Many long-standing community organisations concerned with nature and conservation have grown from an early association with the Royal Society of Victoria, such as the Victorian National Parks Association and the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria. Located in its heritage-listed headquarters at 8 La Trobe Street, in the centre of Melbourne, the Society's modern role is to communicate and advocate for the important role of science in society, providing twice-monthly public lectures about the latest scientific work and thinking underway in Victoria, and convening forums with government and community to explore an evidence-based approach to issues facing the state.https://rsv.org.au/ The Royal Society of Victoria The Society conducts a state-wide program through management of the Inspiring Victoria program, a federally-funded initiative to engage communities with science and promote scientific literacy, including National Science Week.https://inspiringvictoria.org.au/ Inspiring Victoria The Society edits and produces the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria, one of Australia's longest-running regional science journals.

The hall is an architectural landmark in the city, and is adjacent to Temple Square and the Salt Palace on South Temple Street. The hall can hold up to 2,811 occupants. History The Board of the Utah Symphony created a Design and Construction Committee which included Maurice Abravanel, O.C. Tanner, and Jack Gallivan, to advise the architectural design team headed by Bob Fowler.ARCHUtah Construction took three years and $12 million.Northern Utah Photos Abravanel Hall first opened in September 1979, and was originally known as Symphony Hall, but was renamed in May 1993 for Maurice Abravanel, conductor of the Utah Symphony. In 1998, the Hall underwent an expansion project which added wheelchair accessible restrooms, a new Ticket Office, and a new reception room. The expanded facility hosted several events during the 2002 Olympics arts Festival including a concert with Audra McDonald and the Utah Symphony. the building also was decorated with an image of a biathlete during the games. Architecture The hall is actually a concrete building within a brick building. The building was designed by FFKR Architects and acoustical design services were provided by Dr. Cyril M. Harris with the outcome of creating an environment of acoustic excellence. Harris was the acoustical consultant for the remodeled Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., and Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The hall is rectangular in shape, similar to some of the world's finest symphony halls, such as the Grosser Musikvereinssaal in Vienna, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, and Symphony Hall in Boston. The stage was designed strictly for use as a concert hall, and has no proscenium - meaning that it is an extension of the audience. Cello and bass players are also encouraged to make holes in the stage with their endpins, so that their sound resonates with the wood of the hall, and not just their instrument. To enter the hall, patrons must pass through sound lock corridors designed to isolate the concert hall from the noise and confusion of the lobby. Inside the hall, there are convex curved surfaces on the walls and ceilings. There are no perfect ninety degree angles in the hall, because of their effect on sound. Suspended from the ceiling are six 16 x brass chandeliers with 18,000 hand-cut beads and prisms of Bohemian crystals imported from Austria and Czechoslovakia. The lobby is four stories high, with a white oak and brass ceiling, and a glass curtain or wall which covers much of the East face of the triangular-shaped lobby. The lobby itself is an architectural marvel due to its many tiers, the staircase that goes upwards and to the left along with the triangular shape of the enclosure, the gold leafing that covers all visible sides of the stairs and balconies, and the red blown-glass sculpture (The Olympic Tower, by renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly) that is displayed prominently in the middle. This piece was purchased in 2002, after private donors and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee raised Chihuly's asking price of $625,000. The Olympic Tower was valued at $900,000, although Chihuly was willing to sell it at the lower cost pursuant to an agreement that it would stay at Abravanel Hall and that the public would be able to view it without attending a show.

The former individual universities were henceforth to be known as \\"academies\\" (such as the Académie de Paris), but each still retained a rector and local board of its own. The University of France was disbanded in 1896.George Weisz, The emergence of modern universities in France, 1863-1914 (Princeton University Press, 2014). History On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several other departments, the National Convention decided that, independently of the primary schools, > there shall be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of > instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and > workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those > intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for > those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of > all men. The decree of March 17, 1808 set out the operation of the University. The University would provide all levels of education, and no one could teach without the permission of the Grand Master, part of the University. The text provided six schools: the faculties (theology, law, medicine, humanities, sciences), schools, colleges, institutions, residential schools and \\"small schools\\" (primary). Schools of law and medicine created at the end of the Revolution were integrated into the University, as were theological education, literature and science. The decree established the general organisation of these teachings, degrees (three types: bachelor, license, and PhD) and examinations. As for schools, the text established several types of education officials, fourteen of directors and five of teaching. In particular, it set the qualifications to be part of different ranks. The Imperial Decree of 17 March 1808, which determined the organisation of the university, established in Paris a boarding normal school (now the École Normale Supérieure in rue d'Ulm) for training up to 300 young people in the art of teaching the humanities and sciences. The number of students was set at 100 for the first year: they were to be under 17 years of age and allowed by their father or guardian to follow the career of the University. They pledged to stay at least ten years in the teaching profession. They were chosen according to tests by the inspectors general of the University. A first cohort of 54 students was selected from the departments, was made by Mgr. the Grand Master of the Imperial University. Administratively, the University was entrusted to a grand master (Jean-Pierre Louis de Fontanes), appointed and dismissed by the Emperor, assisted by a treasurer and a Chancellor (John Chrysostom Villaret). The decree also provided for a University Council, composed of 30 members divided into 5 sections, and composed entirely of executives of the University. The decree established an academy within the jurisdiction of each Court of Appeal, headed an academy rector assisted by an academic board. The University enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy in relation to the other jurisdictions even if it was closely related to the Emperor. Although the text did not expressly grant it legal personality, it was considered a legal person, with its own budget. Measures were to be taken immediately by \\"means of execution, the department and the municipality of Paris are authorised to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic\\". All faculties were replaced by the University of France. After a century, people recognised that the new system was less favourable to study. The University of France was disbanded in 1896, when the universities regained a relative independence (but still within a centralised national system, with the Ministry of Education as the highest authority).Weisz, The emergence of modern universities in France, 1863-1914 (2014). After Napoleon In the first years of the Restoration, the full name of the University tended to lapse because of its imperial origin. The council of the University took the name from the Board of Education (1815-1820), then the Royal Education Council (1820-1822). If the title of Grand Master was removed, the president of the committee responsible was made the figure of Grand Master. The latter name was, moreover, restored in 1822. The creation of a Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction did not affect the University, but the functions of the Ministry of Public Instruction and the Grand Master were indistinguishable from 1828. During the years afterwards, in particular the July Monarchy, the University symbolised public education, centralised and judged by its critics as not Catholic enough (although it was not strictly secular), as opposed to private education, especially denominational. Supporters of freedom of education opposed the university. They got some satisfaction within the two royal regimes but got, during the Second Republic, two important changes in 1850. The Falloux Act, promulgated on March 15, grants a significant portion to the freedom of education (except for the top) and decentralised and weaken public education by creating an academy for every department: \\"This is not the University multiplied by 86, this is the University divided by 86\\". The act also change the name of the University Council to the Supreme Council of Public Instruction. As for the Finance Act of 1851, it operated the transfer of assets of the State University, which tended to suppress the university without official declaration. With the arrival of the Second Empire, the term reappeared to apply it before the link between the Napoleon III's Empire and its predecessor. Even so, the term is more often involved in the University of France (and not imperial). However, the Third Republic greatly contributes to the declining term, when the act of July 10, 1896 (known as the Louis Liard law) assigned legal personality to the \\"bodily faculties\\" made in each academy by the Act of April 28, 1893, giving them the name of universities. There was a university in each academy and the term of the \\"University of France\\", as a unified whole, made little sense. The term nevertheless remains, especially in decree No. 48-1108 of July 10, 1948, on the ranking of the state of civilians and military personnel.

It forms western part of Lesser Poland, though it shares some cultural and historical features with the neighbouring Upper Silesia. The region is sometimes referred to in English as Zaglembie or Zaglembia, especially in Jewish publications written in the English language. See also:  Geography  Zagłębie is a highly industrialised and densely populated region of southern Lesser Poland, bordering Silesia through the Brynica river (running between Sosnowiec and Katowice). Apart from the three main cultural and industrial centres of the area (Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec and Będzin), the region also includes a number of smaller cities. Among them are Czeladź, Wojkowice, Siewierz and Sławków, and also smaller villages: Psary, Ożarowice, Bobrowniki and Mierzęcice. Since the borders of the region were never clearly defined, other towns are also sometimes listed among the cities of Zagłębie. These are: Zawiercie, Poręba, Włodowice, Kroczyce, Ogrodzieniec, Łazy and Olkusz.  Name and district capital  The name Zagłębie Dąbrowskie was first used in ca. 1850, by Jozef Cieszkowski, a clerk employed at Western Coal District in Dąbrowa Górnicza. At that time, the town of Dąbrowa Górnicza was quickly growing, emerging as a main center of the region. The adjective \\"dabrowskie\\" comes from the name of the town. The capital of the region has never been officially established. Sosnowiec is the largest city of Zaglebie, but Czeladź is the oldest.  History  Defensive castle in Będzin from the Middle Ages Until the 19th century, Zagłębie shared the fate of the rest of the region of Lesser Poland, and belonged to Kraków Voivodeship, with the exception of the Duchy of Siewierz, which between 1177 and 1443 was under the rule of Silesian dukes. On 30 December 1443, the Duchy was incorporated back into Lesser Poland as Polish fief and a property of the bishops of Kraków. After the Partitions of Poland, in 1795 Zagłębie was briefly annexed to the Prussian province of New Silesia. In 1807 however, during the Napoleonic Wars and the Polish–Austrian War, it was liberated and became part of the Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna, along with the greater part of the Duchy, Zagłębie became part of the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland. Simultaneously, in both Upper Silesia and neighbouring Zagłębie, large deposits of coal were discovered. With the opening of the Warsaw–Vienna railway in 1848, the region became the most industrialised part of the Kingdom. Despite developing simultaneously with adjacent Silesia, the region remained outside of German influence and remained largely Polish, a fact that is still a source of a certain animosity between the Silesians and the Zagłębiacy, natives of Zagłębie. Zagłębie is sometimes called \\"Red\\", because of its Socialist or Communist traditions (it was one of main centers of the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–07)), while Silesia is more conservative and religious. After Poland regained her independence in 1918, Zagłębie became part of the Kielce Voivodeship, while the formerly German-held Upper Silesia became part of a separate Silesian Voivodeship. After World War II most of Zagłębie was attached to the Silesian Voivodeship, later Katowice Voivodeship and recently Silesian Voivodeship. On March 25, 1992, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sosnowiec was created. It is called sometimes the Diocese of Zagłębie.  Zagłębie dialect of the Polish language  Residents of the region spoke their own dialect, which now is largely extinct. It belonged to Lesser Poland group of dialects, with some Silesian and Russian additions (because Zagłębie in 1815–1915 was part of the Russian Empire). Several Polonized words of Russian origin were in common use, such as \\"skolko\\" (standard Polish: \\"ile\\", English: \\"How much\\"), or \\"konfiety\\" (standard Polish: \\"cukierki\\", English: \\"sweets\\").  Jews of Zagłębie  The memorial forest in memory of the Jews of Zagłębie, near the city of Modiin in Israel At the start of World War II, 100,000 Jews lived in the area of Zagłębie. On August 12, 1942 all the Jews of the region were gathered together and after a selection process, 12,500 of them were deemed unfit for work and were sent to Auschwitz for immediate extermination. The rest of the Jews were sent to slave labor camps throughout the Nazi empire. A forest was planted in Israel near the city of Modiin in memory of the Jews of Zagłębie. The memorial plaque reads: > Tens of Jewish communities thrived and prospered throughout the Zagłęmbie > region of south west Poland over the course of 700 years.

Operating from 1862 to 1865 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, its physicians and nurses rendered care to thousands of Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners. After its patient population spiked following the battles of Bull Run and Gettysburg, this hospital became the second-largest in the country with 34 wards and hundreds of tents containing 4,500 beds. Initially referred to as the West Philadelphia General Hospital, it was later renamed in honor of Richard Sherwood Satterlee,\\"Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania, March 24, 2011. a physician from Seneca County, New York, who was stationed with the United States Army at Fort Winnebago in Portage, Wisconsin, during the Black Hawk War, and then rose to prominence and was brevetted as a lieutenant colonel, colonel, and brigadier general during America's Civil War \\"for diligent care and attention in procuring proper army supplies, as Medical Purveyor, and for economy and fidelity in the disbursement of large sums of money.\\"\\"Surgeon R.S.

Isaac Israel Hayes, c. 1860–1875.Founded in 1862 by order of Surgeon-General William Alexander Hammond, the hospital was built in the sparsely developed neighborhood of West Philadelphia near the intersection of 42nd Street and Baltimore Avenue on grounds which ran north to 45th and Pine Streets. The initial 2,500-bed facility was built in just 40 days. Nursing duties at Satterlee were performed by members of the Daughters of Charity, who began their work before the facility was finished or fully equipped. The hospital's \\"chapel was so small,\\" according to historians at the Catholic Historical Research Center in Philadelphia, \\"that some sisters had to exit the room so others could enter and receive Holy Communion.\\" Eating separately from, and earlier than, the military officers who also worked at the hospital, they were given just four of the officers' utensils to share. Ultimately, more than 100 Daughters of Charity worked at the hospital, living in a convent on the grounds, with Sister Mary Gonzaga Grace as their superioress. The facility's commanding officer was Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes, a native of Chester County, Pennsylvania, and graduate of the Westtown School and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School who had achieved a measure of fame as an Arctic explorer with the Second Grinnell Expedition of 1853-55 and with his own 1860-61 expedition in search of the Open Polar Sea before joining the United States Army as a surgeon.Drabelle, Dennis. \\"Pointing the Way to the Pole,\\" in The Pennsylvania Gazette, November–December 2011. Philadelphia Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania. The hospital's chaplain was the pastor at St. Patrick's church located at 20th and Locust Streets, Father Peter McGrane, who heard confessions and offered mass daily, and also offered assistance with baptisms and burials. \\"Archbishop James Wood also visited Satterlee several times to confirm many adult converts,\\" the Catholic Historical Research Center historians wrote. In 1862, the hospital added military tents with beds to handle the influx of hundreds of soldiers wounded in the Second Battle of Bull Run. The hospital had become a \\"self-contained city\\" by 1863. After the Battle of Gettysburg in July of that year, \\"the greatest number of wounded were admitted to the hospital in a single month...swelling the hospital population to more than 6,000.\\" That August, hospital clerks recorded \\"the greatest number of deaths in any one month\\" — an average of more than one a day. Supply needs rose as well: in \\"just one year, patients consumed more than 800,000 pounds of bread, 16,000 pounds of butter and 334,000 quarts of milk.\\" By 1864, the hospital was surrounded by a 14-foot tall fence and included a barber shop, carpenter shop, clothing store, dispensary, three kitchens, laundry, library, post office, reading room, and a printing office that printed Satterlee's newspaper, The Hospital Register. Gettysburg Stone marking the former site of Satterlee General Hospital. Over the course of the hospital's operation, Satterlee's physicians and nurses treated some 50,000 sick and wounded people, losing only 260, a notable accomplishment considering the sanitary conditions and medical techniques of the day. Following the Confederate army's Surrender at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, the number of patients sent to Satterlee gradually began to decline, and the hospital was closed on August 3, 1865.Burch, Brian and Emily Stimpson.

By the time of Augustus, the meaning of these rituals had become obscure even to those who practiced them. For the May rites, a procession of pontiffs, Vestals, and praetors made its way around a circuit of 27 stations (sacella or sacraria), where at each they retrieved a figure fashioned into human form from rush, reed, and straw, resembling men tied hand and foot. After all the stations were visited, the procession, accompanied by the Flaminica Dialis in mourning guise, moved to the Pons Sublicius, the oldest known bridge in Rome, where the gathered figures were tossed into the Tiber River. Both the figures (effigies or simulacra) and the stations or shrines were called Argei, the etymology of which remains undetermined.Robert E.A. Palmer, The Archaic Community of the Romans (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 84. The continuation of these rites into the later historical period when they were no longer understood demonstrates how strongly traditionalist the Romans were in matters of religion.Ittai Gradel, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 11. Interpretations Before the ritual commenced, an effigy was placed in each of the 27 (or in some sources 24 or 30) shrines of the Argei (sacra Argeorum) throughout the Servian regions. The effigies were thought to absorb pollution within the area, and their subsequent sacrifice was a ritual purification of the city. The pontiffs and Vestals were the main celebrants. The exact route of the procession among the stations is unclear. According to Ovid, the ritual had been established as a sacrifice to the god Saturn as the result of a responsum from Jupiter Fatidicus, the oracle of Dodona.Ovid, Fasti 5.622-623; see English translation by A. S. Kline (2004). But the meaning of the ritual had already become obscure, and Ovid offers an antiquarian range of explanations.Ovid, Fasti 5.622-660. The responsum had prescribed human sacrifice, one man for each one of the gentes (families or clans) living near the banks of the Tiber. This early population was believed to have been of Greek origin, and hence Argei derived from Argivi (the Greek ethnonym \\"Argives\\"), specifically the companions of Evander and later those of Hercules who had decided to stay on and live there. This responsum predated the founding of Rome. One way to interpret the ritual of the Argei was that early inhabitants of what was to become Rome had practiced human sacrifice as prescribed; Ovid insists, however, that Hercules had put an end to it, and that human sacrifice was never a practice of the Romans themselves. Ovid puts another interpretation in the mouth of Tiber, the god who personified the river. Since these early inhabitants were of Greek origin, he said, they grew homesick in their old age and asked to be buried in the river as a kind of symbolic return to their homeland in death. While this last interpretation appears irreconcilable with the previous, it may be reminiscent of burial practices in water which are attested in many parts of the world among primitive peoples.Mircea Eliade, Le chamanisme et les techniques archaiques de l'exctase (Paris 1964). Dionysius of HalicarnassusDionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, i.19, 38. also explains the ritual in terms of human sacrifice, saying that Tiber was the recipient of these regular offerings. Alternative modern interpretations include a pre-Imperial rainmaking rite, or an annual re-enactment of the execution by drowning of 27 Greek war captives.

Mobile equipment to send news over a satellite link used by TVNZ news reporters. Prior to its development, \\"ad hoc\\" or \\"occasional use\\" satellite news feeds were transmitted either using proprietary encryption methods (e.g. RAS, or PowerVu), or without any encryption. Unencrypted satellite feeds allowed anyone with the correct equipment to view the program material. Proprietary encryption methods were determined by encoder manufacturers, and placed major compatibility limitations on the type of satellite receiver (IRD) that could be used for each feed. BISS was an attempt to create an \\"open platform\\" encryption system, which could be used across a range of manufacturers equipment. Fields for entering BISS-keys on an Ericsson RX8200 IRD There are mainly two different types of BISS encryption used: * BISS-1 transmissions are protected by a 12 digit hexadecimal \\"session key\\" that is agreed by the transmitting and receiving parties prior to transmission. The key is entered into both the encoder and decoder, this key then forms part of the encryption of the digital TV signal and any receiver with BISS-support with the correct key will decrypt the signal. * BISS-E (E for encrypted) is a variation where the decoder has stored one secret BISS-key entered by for example a rightsholder. This is unknown to the user of the decoder. The user is then sent a 16-digit hexadecimal code, which is entered as a \\"session key\\". This session key is then mathematically combined internally to calculate a BISS-1 key that can decrypt the signal. Only a decoder with the correct secret BISS-key will be able to decrypt a BISS-E feed. This gives rightsholder control as to exactly which decoder can be used to decrypt/decode a specific feed. Any BISS-E encrypted feed will have a corresponding BISS-1 key that will unlock it. BISS-E is amongst others used by EBU to protect UEFA Champions League and other high-profile satellite feeds.

Bolland worked for the Advertising Standards Authority and the Press Complaints Commission before serving as Deputy Private Secretary to Charles, Prince of Wales, from 1997 to 2002. During his time with Charles, Bolland was credited with rehabilitating the prince's public image and enhancing the public image of the relationship between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, who would become the prince's second wife. After leaving the Prince Charles, Bolland established a public relations and communications firm, Mark Bolland & Associates, and has held several roles in the charitable and third sector. Biography=Early life Bolland was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Arthur Bolland, who had emigrated from Middlesbrough in England, and his wife Joan. Before Bolland's birth his parents had had a daughter, Tracy, who had died aged six of a hole in the heart. Bolland was born a year after his sister's death. His parents later had a third child, Diana, and the family returned to England. Bolland was educated at the King's Manor School in Middlesbrough, and the University of York, where he received a BSc in chemistry. After university Bolland worked as a public affairs executive with Public Affairs International in Toronto before joining IBM's UK branch as a marketing executive where he worked from 1987 to 1988. Bolland then joined the Advertising Standards Authority and began a career in media regulation. Lord McGregor, then Chairman of the ASA, promoted Bolland to be Research Manager and Adviser to him and the Director-General from 1989 to 1991. Bolland then followed Lord McGregor to the newly created Press Complaints Commission (PCC), serving as his executive assistant and then being promoted to Director of the PCC from 1992 to 1996. McGregor's successor at the PCC, Lord Wakeham, recommended to Charles, Prince of Wales, that Bolland should work as his adviser, and Bolland's partner, Guy Black, who had worked previously for Wakeham, subsequently succeeded him as director of the PCC. Deputy Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales Bolland was appointed Assistant Private Secretary to Charles, Prince of Wales in August 1996, and in 1997 became Deputy Private Secretary. Bolland has been described as a 'key figure' in the rehabilitation of Charles following his negative public image after the death of his first wife, Diana, in 1997 and helping to create public acceptance for the relationship between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles which led to their marriage in 2005.Alan Hamilton. \\"The pariah Prince wins back the hearts of his public.\\", The Times, London, 24 October 1998, pg. 21. The popularity rating of Charles increased from a low of 20 per cent following the death of Diana to 75 per cent during Bolland's tenure. Bolland and the prince's Private Secretary, Stephen Lamport, helped devise a media strategy that enhanced the public image of Charles and Camilla's relationship. The pair orchestrated the media coverage of the prince's first photographed public appearance with Camilla at the Ritz Hotel in January 1999 (dubbed 'Operation Ritz'), and of Camilla's first meeting with the Queen in June 2000 at a private party at Highgrove House. A June 2000 article in The Times by Andrew Pierce said that the media coverage of the meeting between the Queen and Camilla had marked 'the culmination of three years work by Bolland and Lamport' who since the divorce of Charles and Diana had 'worked tirelessly ever since on the public rehabilitation of Prince Charles and Parker Bowles...In the past week Parker Bowles has lost the loaded word mistress. She is now referred to as companion or even partner'.Andrew Pierce. \\"How the mistress became a partner.\\", The Times, London, 9 June 2000. The first report of the Highgrove meeting was published in The News of the World, then edited by Rebekah Brooks, a close friend of Bolland. An October 1998 article in The Times called \\"The Prince's Circle\\" described Bolland as having been '...credited with \\"updating\\" the Prince's image' by encouraging Charles to meet the Spice Girls, Nelson Mandela, and Peter Mandelson but also said that he was blamed for the negative publicity that resulted from Penny Junor's biography of the prince, Charles: Victim or Villain?.\\"The Prince's Circle.\\", The Times, London, 31 October 1998 Bolland also helped the establishment of special media arrangements to safeguard the privacy of Charles's sons, princes William and Harry at school and university, and was reportedly nicknamed \\"Blackadder\\" by the young princes. As a result of allegations by George Smith, a former royal valet, Charles was forced to deny an allegation that had not previously been public knowledge. Bolland felt that the story had become public because of courtiers who resented the close links between himself and the PCC run by his partner, Guy Black. In a 2004 interview with Mary Riddell, Bolland said that \\"If you start throwing lawyers at some newspapers, they think you have something to hide. The story had been around for two or three years, and we (St James's Palace) had all said it was utterly ridiculous and that we would make any paper who published it look incredibly stupid. I think there was a reaction against what was seen to be too cosy a relationship between the Palace and the press's self-regulatory mechanism; ie, me and Guy. They thought that was the wrong way of doing things, and bringing the lawyers in was the right way. They got overly aggressive... and that's why it all came out into the public domain.\\" Lamport was replaced as the prince's Private Secretary by Michael Peat in 2002 and Bolland later felt that he should have left at the same time, but felt under pressure to stay. Bolland was also accused of leaking negative stories about British royal family members, with Sholto Byrnes writing in a 2005 article in The Independent that 'By making them look bad, it was said, he made his boss look good in comparison.' In the same article Bolland himself said that \\"The team that was there probably cared too much and got too emotional about it at times...We got in a sort of Prince of Wales bunker within the House of Windsor. But to an extent that reflected him.\\" In The News of the World in 2003 Bolland claimed that in a phone call Peat had asked him if Charles was bisexual, to which Bolland said that he was astonished at the question and had told him \\"...emphatically that the Prince was not gay or bisexual.\\" Bolland later said in a 2004 interview that \\"What I was saying was that it had all got out of hand, because too many people around the Palace were asking that question. Clearly it is a preposterous question to ask. I think I helped end the story, because it actually died the next day...I'm sure other people wouldn't share that interpretation. Had I been a bit naughty? Well, probably. In hindsight, it maybe wasn't the smartest thing to have done because it put me into the middle of it all. I should actually have stayed out.\\" His role was recognised by the PR industry in 2001 when he was awarded the prestigious PR Week \\"Professional of the Year Award\\". A two part television series on Bolland's work for Charles, Reinventing the Royals, was due to be broadcast on BBC 2 in January 2014 but was postponed. The programme was written and presented by Steve Hewlett and was made without cooperation or the involvement of the royal family. Post-royal work Bolland established the public relations and communications consultancy, Mark Bolland & Associates. Bolland has held numerous positions in the third sector, having joined the Journalists' Charity as its vice-president in 2007, and serving as a trustee of the Open Futures Trust from 2010 to 2014 and the Middlesbrough and Teesside Philanthropic Foundation from 2012 to 2014. Bolland has also served as a trustee of several high net worth family charitable foundations and trusts including the Helen Hamlyn Trust from 2008 to 2014, the David Ross Foundation from 2011 to present, and as director of the Bertarelli Foundation from 2013. Bolland wrote the \\"Restaurant Spy\\" column for ES, the lifestyle magazine of the London Evening Standard from 2006 to 2009, has contributed occasional articles for the Mail on Sunday, and book reviews for the British Journalism Review, and wrote a column for the News of the World under the byline of 'Blackadder'. He has also appeared on Newsnight Review. In June 2011 The Independent alleged that Bolland was closely linked to organised efforts to remove information from the English Wikipedia articles of the clients of his firm including Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby, David Ross, Maan Al-Sanea, and Bolland's partner, Guy Black. A single IP address in Clerkenwell, the location of Mark Bolland & Associates, had made several edits to the articles. In 2014, Bolland was named as one of London's most 1000 influential people by the Evening Standard. Bolland is a member of the Garrick Club. Personal life Bolland entered a civil partnership with his partner Guy Black in February 2006 at Islington Town Hall, in a ceremony witnessed by Murdoch MacLennan, the chief executive of the Telegraph Media Group, and Rebekah Brooks, then editor of The Sun. On 22 June 2015, the couple married, again at Islington Town Hall. The couple live in Clerkenwell. Black was the former Press Secretary to Michael Howard during Howard's period as leader of the Conservative Party, and presently serves as the executive director of the Telegraph Media Group. Black was created a life peer in 2010 as Baron Black of Brentwood, and sits as a Conservative member of the House of Lords.

The label was founded by Strachwitz in 1960 as a way for him to record and produce music by previously obscure \\"down-home blues\\" artists such as Lightnin' Hopkins, Snooks Eaglin, and Bill Gaither. Arhoolie still publishes blues and folk music, Tejano music including Lydia Mendoza, Los Alegres de Terán, Flaco Jiménez, regional Mexican music, cajun, zydeco, and bluegrass. History Chris Strachwitz immigrated with his family from Silesia in 1947, and became enamored with American regional music after seeing the film New Orleans. He eventually settled in the San Francisco bay area, and in 1960 he headed to Texas to record bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins, but it turned out that Hopkins was in Berkeley for a performance engagement. He met up with historian Mack McCormick, and together they traveled to Navasota, Texas where Strachwitz recorded Mance Lipscomb for what would become the first Arhoolie LP, Texas Sharecropper and Songster. The name \\"Arhoolie\\" was suggested by McCormick, deriving from a word for a field holler. Strachwitz also recorded \\"Black Ace\\" Turner, \\"Li'l Son\\" Jackson and \\"Whistling\\" Alex Moore on the same trip, and later in the year recorded Big Joe Williams and Mercy Dee Walton in California. He also began reissuing archive material, both of R&B; singers such as Big Joe Turner and Lowell Fulson who had recorded for the defunct Swingtime label, and old country and western recordings on his Old Timey label, started in 1962. Strachwitz continued traveling to make field recordings of blues musicians, notably Mississippi Fred McDowell - whom he first recorded in 1964 - Juke Boy Bonner, K. C. Douglas, and Clifton Chenier. From 1965, he also hosted a Sunday afternoon music program on Pacifica Radio's KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California, which ran until 1995. In 1966, his friend Ed Denson introduced him to a local band, Country Joe and the Fish, who were active in anti-Vietnam war protests at Berkeley. Strachwitz recorded the band singing \\"I Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die\\", and gained a share of the song's publishing rights. Eventually, royalties from the song - particularly its appearance in the Woodstock Festival movie and soundtrack album - helped subsidize the Arhoolie label, and enabled Strachwitz to buy a building in San Pablo Avenue, El Cerrito, California as the label's headquarters. Strachwitz also won royalties for Fred McDowell from the Rolling Stones' performance of his song \\"You Gotta Move\\" on their Sticky Fingers album. During the 1970s, Strachwitz continued to record blues musicians, including Big Joe Duskin, Charlie Musselwhite, Big Mama Thornton, Elizabeth Cotten, and Robben Ford, as well as Cajun and zydeco performers such as Clifton Chenier, Lawrence Ardoin and John Delafose. He also continued to secure the rights to release archive blues material such as that by Snooks Eaglin and Robert Pete Williams. In the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to develop Arhoolie as a distributor of smaller independent blues labels, and an importer of jazz and blues releases on European labels. Strachwitz increasingly focused attention on Mexican and, specifically, norteño music, which he had long admired, amassing what is believed to be the largest private collection of Mexican-American and Mexican music. He donated this collection, known as the Strachwitz Frontera Collection of Mexican and Mexican-American Music, to the nonprofit organization Arhoolie Foundation. The first norteño album on Arhoolie was Conjuntos Norteños, by Los Pinguinos del Norte, released in 1970, but one of his biggest successes came with Flaco Jiménez, whose album Ay Te Dejo en San Antonio won a Grammy Award in 1986. With cinematographer Les Blank, he also made two documentaries about the music in the mid 1970s, Chulas Fronteras and Del Mero Corazon. He discovered and released the first two albums of seminal klezmer revival band The Klezmorim. Another of Strachwitz's discoveries, and one of his biggest commercial successes, was Cajun musician Michael Doucet and his group BeauSoleil. Artists who have recorded for the Arhoolie label include Big Mama Thornton, Big Walter Horton, Dave Alexander, Nathan Beauregard, Juke Boy Bonner, Clifton Chenier, Elizabeth Cotten, Sue Draheim, Jesse Fuller, Earl Hooker, John Jackson, Mance Lipscomb, Guitar Slim, Robert Shaw, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Whistlin' Alex Moore, George 'Bongo Joe' Coleman, Charlie Musselwhite, Doctor Ross, Bukka White, Big Joe Williams, Silas Hogan, Mercy Dee Walton, Black Ace, The Campbell Brothers, BeauSoleil, Jerry Hahn, the Savoy Family Band, the Pine Leaf Boys, Los Cenzontles, The Klezmorim, Rose Maddox, Rebirth Brass Band, and HowellDevine. In 2014, filmmakers Maureen Gosling and Chris Simon released a documentary film about Arhoolie Records entitled This Ain't No Mouse Music, which is distributed by Argot Pictures.

Early life He was born Christian Alexander Maria, Graf Strachwitz von Groß-Zauche und Camminetz, in Gross Reichenau, Lower Silesia, then within Germany and now known as Bogaczów, Poland. His family were aristocratic farm owners, with some American antecedents; Strachwitz's mother's grandfather was US Senator Francis G. Newlands. In 1945, under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement after World War II, he and his family were among the millions of German-speaking people forcibly resettled to the west of the Oder-Neisse line which became the eastern boundary of Germany.Garner, Carla and Benjamin Brady. \\"Chris Strachwitz.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified May 06, 2015. Strachwitz's family settled temporarily with relatives in Braunschweig, in the British zone of Allied- occupied Germany, where he first heard swing music played on Armed Forces Radio. In 1947, the family emigrated to the United States, moving first to Reno, Nevada, and then to Santa Barbara, California. Strachwitz attended Cate School in nearby Carpinteria. He became interested in jazz after seeing the movie New Orleans, starring Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong, and began collecting jazz records. He stated in a 2010 interview: > The rhythms haunted me.... I'd hear all this stuff on the radio, and it just > knocked me over. I thought this was absolutely the most wonderful thing I > had ever heard. After graduating from Cate in 1951, he attended Pomona College in Claremont, and started visiting jazz clubs in Los Angeles as well as rhythm and blues shows featuring Lightnin' Hopkins, Howlin' Wolf and others. He began taping the radio broadcasts and live shows of his friend, jazz musician Frank Demond, before enrolling in 1952 at UC Berkeley, where he booked jazz and R&B; performers as entertainment at football games. He became a United States citizen, and was drafted into the US Army in 1954, being stationed in Salzburg, Austria, from where he continued to see touring jazz shows. After finishing his service he returned to Berkeley, completing his studies in engineering, mathematics and physics, and then taking a degree in political science and an advanced degree in secondary education in 1960. At the same time, he continued to develop his technical skills, learning from established producer Bob Geddins and through recording San Francisco street musician Jesse Fuller, jazz saxophonist Sonny Simmons and others. He also worked as a high school teacher in Los Gatos for three years from 1959. Arhoolie Records In summer 1959, he made a trip to Houston, Texas, intending to visit his hero, Lightnin' Hopkins. Although unable to record Hopkins at the time due to lack of money and equipment, he resolved to return to the area the following year. With the proceeds from trading in 78 rpm records, he bought new recording equipment, set up the Arhoolie label, and in 1960 returned to Texas where, with the assistance of \\"Mack\\" McCormick, he recorded Mance Lipscomb for the first time. Lipscomb's album, Texas Songster and Sharecropper, became Arhoolie's first release in November 1960, in an edition of 250 copies. The name \\"Arhoolie\\" was suggested by McCormick, deriving from a word for a field holler.

He also continued travelling to make field recordings of blues musicians, notably Mississippi Fred McDowell (whom he first recorded in 1964), Juke Boy Bonner, K. C. Douglas, and Clifton Chenier.

In 2013, Strachwitz saw HowellDevine performing live and signed them to Arhoolie for the two albums that followed. In 1998, Strachwitz became an early supporter of the independent documentary film, Genghis Blues, about the trip of San Francisco bay area blues man Paul Pena to The Republic of Tuva in Siberia. The film depicts the traditional art of khoomei, or throat singing, and Pena's unique way of blending it with blues music. The film garnered numerous honors including an Academy Award nomination. Awards and legacy In 1993, Strachwitz received a lifetime achievement award from the Blues Symposium for his role in preserving the blues, and in 1999 was inducted as a non-performing member of the Blues Hall of Fame. In 1995 he formed the Arhoolie Foundation \\"to document, preserve, present and disseminate authentic traditional and regional vernacular music.\\" The Foundation owns the Chris Strachwitz Frontera Collection, comprising about 44,000 commercially issued phonograph records of Mexican-American and Mexican vernacular material, issued between around 1906 and the 1990s, which are now in the process of being digitized. In 2009, the collection was opened to the public at the Chicano Studies Research Center of the University of California, Los Angeles.

Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga, Haut- Lomami and Lualaba provinces are the result of the dismemberment of the former Katanga province. Tanganyika was formed from the Tanganyika district whose town of Kalemie was elevated to capital city of the new province. The new province's territory corresponds to the historic Nord-Katanga province that existed in the early period of post-colonial Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1962 and 1966. History Tanganyika province was the scene of a rebellion by the Luba-Katanga people against the independent state of Katanga. In 1961, it was reconquered by the Katanga state, only to be taken back by the Kinshasa government later that year. From July 11, 1962, to December 28, 1966, this area was known as the province of Nord-Katanga, but the administration of the province was taken over in 1966 by the central government, and it was finally merged into the restored Katanga Province by the Mobutu government, where it was administered as the Tanganyika district. In 2015, Tanganyika was restored to full provincial status. In July 2006 that during the Second Congo War, Katanga province was divided by fighting between the Rally for Congolese Democracy – Goma (RCD-G) faction, supported by Rwanda, and the ex-government faction, supported by local Mai Mai troops.U.S. Embassy Kinshasa, 06KINSHASA1080 North Katanga: The Weakest Security Link In The Volatile East?, 6 July 2006 While the RCD-G and some Mai Mai militia have been subsumed into the Congolese army (FARDC), many Mai Mai elements remain outside of government control.

It is also commonly known as the small postman, the red passion flower butterfly, or the crimson-patched longwing. It was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. H. erato exhibits Müllerian mimicry with other Heliconius butterflies such as Heliconius melpomene in order to warn common predators against attacking, which contributes to its surprising longevity. It also has a unique mating ritual involving the transfer of anti-aphrodisiacs from males to females. Recent field work has confirmed the relative abundance of this butterfly.  Habitat and home range  H. erato is a neotropical species, found from southern Texas to northern Argentina and Paraguay, and resides on the edges of tropical rainforests. It is philopatric, having a particularly restricted home range. In areas of dense population in Trinidad, some home ranges are only separated by 30 yards, but H. erato rarely travels to neighboring home ranges.  Food resources  220x220px  Caterpillars  Larvae feed on the host plant, first consuming the terminal bud. After they have exhausted the resources of the plant they have hatched on, later instars may move to another plant.  Adults  H. erato is a pollen-feeding species, collecting from the Lantana camara flower. They do not spend much time or energy collecting nectar (only remaining for a few seconds). Instead, they collect pollen in a mass on the ventral side of their proboscis. They then agitate the pollen by coiling and uncoiling their proboscis in order to release its nutrients. H. erato is then able to extract nitrogenous compounds in a clear liquid, including amino acids like arginine, leucine, lysine, valine, proline, histidine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and tryptophan. Females typically carry larger loads of pollen than males as females require more amino acids for egg production.  Co-evolution between Heliconius erato and host plants  Previous studies have shown that host plants, such as Passiflora, have coevolved with Heliconius butterflies. Passiflora plants are usually found in low densities with even less plants in fruiting or flower conditions due to caterpillar feeding. To increase chances of survival and cross-pollination, Passiflora plants synthesize toxins in leaves to deter Heliconius. Passiflora species produce different toxins, leading to different preferences for oviposition among Heliconius species. This leads to a lower chance of herbivore damage for individual Passiflora species and thus helps protect Passiflora plants. Chemical composition of toxins in such plants have not been studied widely. Studies have identified cyanogenic glycosides and alkaloids as potential chemicals that drive distasteful reactions among Heliconius. Toxin variation among Passiflora is one of the reasons for host specificity among Heliconius butterflies. Studies have shown that H. erato species that feed on specific Passiflora species tend to spend more time on the host plant and are thus exposed to the toxins for a longer period. Accumulation of toxins such as cyanogenic glycosides leads to a low survival rate among H. erato larvae. Increasing exposure to parasitoids due to longer time spent on the host plant also contributes to the high mortality rate. One recent study showed that mortality increased among H. erato larvae which fed on cyanide-releasing Passiflora. Survived butterflies were capable of excreting higher levels of cyanides, suggesting a defense mechanism in H. erato. H. erato species with more mechanisms to detoxify and secrete ingested toxins are the result of genetic differences among H. erato subspecies. Toxin excretion, from previous studies, results in changes in wing pattern and body size. Consequences include decreased fecundity, egg size, and survival rate. Nectar excretion from Passiflora has also been studied as one factor which contributes to coevolution. Passiflora nectar is known to produce aggressive behaviors among ants, wasps, and egg parasitoids. Ehrlich and Gilbert have estimated that parasitoids are capable of destroying most Heliconius eggs under nectar influence. Therefore, host plants such as Passiflora are believed to have self-defense mechanisms that utilize predators against Heliconius butterflies.  Parental care  Female ovipositing  Oviposition  H. erato subspecies have innate, localized host plant preferences for oviposition. These predilections do not vary based on one's own larval host plant or with experimental conditioning. Adult females have been observed to oviposit on the meristem of their host species. Individual plant choice is based on internode length, terminal bud presence, shoot size, and leaf area, in order to confer greater larval survival advantage. In H. erato phyllis, plant choice is contingent upon terminal bud presence and condition. However, selection by quality generally depends on host plant abundance and availability.  Host plants  Host plants include a wide variety of passion flower (Passiflora) vines, including: * P. biflora * P. suberosa * P. misera (preferred by H. erato phyillis) * P. capsularis * P. elegans * P. actinia * P. granadilla ** menispermifoliae ** setaceae ** pedatae ** imbricatae ** incarnatae ** simplificoliae ** lobatae ** kermesinae ** tryphostemmatoides ** psilanthis ** psudomurucuja * P. plectostemma ** auriculata ** cieca ** xerogona  Social behavior  The red postman returns to a communal roost every night that contains members of the same species and of other heliconids. The roost is typically situated about 2–10 meters from the ground on twigs and tendrils and is occupied by a small group of butterflies. Adults who have just emerged from the pupa typically roost alone for a few days before roosting with others.  Life history = Life cycle  The red postman has been observed to live in the wild for at least 20 days. In captivity, they live for more than a month and have been recorded to live up to 186 days. This is significantly longer than other temperate and tropical butterflies, which live for a month at best in captivity. H. erato longevity can be explained by its benign climate and undoubted unpalatability, as well as the benefits from digesting pollen.Larva = Egg = The H. erato female lays one to four yellow eggs a day that average 1.5 mm in height and 0.9 mm in diameter. The eggs have a unique texture, with about 16 vertical and 11 horizontal ridges. Some plants mimic this in order to discourage females from ovipositing on them. = Larva = The caterpillar appearance is very discrete when young and has a small, dark prothoracic plate. As it matures, its appearance grows more colorful. Caterpillars of H. erato chestertonii have a unique dark stripe on their side. In its fifth instar, it has a white body with black and orange spots, black spikes, and a yellow head. = Pupa = Pupae reside on the stem of host plants. Heliconius pupae are usually camouflaged and have defensive spikes. Pupae may be light or dark. = Imago = Adult males have androconial scales on the subcostal region of their hindwings and on their median membrane. Adult wingspans range from about 6.7 to 8.0 cm. Adults have a variety of phenotypes, all with red coloration. These include: dennis-ray pattern (\\"dennis\\" refers to a red patch on the forewing; \\"ray\\" refers to red lines on the hindwing); red on the forewing with yellow on the hindwing; yellow on the forewing and red on the hindwing; and white or yellow on the hindwing and forewing. H. erato chestertonii is the only subspecies without any red markings, instead displaying blue.  Enemies  H. erato is preyed on by birds, lizards, monkeys, and mantids, but is relatively safe due to its unpalatability and protective coloration.  Protective coloration = Müllerian mimicry  H. erato is particularly distasteful to predators. Subspecies have evolved as Müllerian mimics, sharing aposematic patterns with other species in order to deter common predators. They typically co-mimic with other species of Heliconius, most often H. melpomene, which matches with at least 20 of the 27 subspecies. Subspecies have region-specific patterns that correspond to their regional mimics. H. erato chestertonii is unique as it displays blue on its wings while most other subspecies have red markings. It is the only subspecies that lacks a H. melpomene co-mimic: instead, its pattern corresponds with a subspecies of H. cydno, H. cydno gustavi. Variations from the geographical phenotype of subspecies are penalized by increased predation. In one study, researchers painted H. erato petiverana in Costa Rica to look like H. erato chestertonii from Colombia. These two subspecies successfully warn predators in their own regions with Müllerian patterns with H. melpomene rosina and H. cydno gustavi, respectively. However, the painted H. erato petiverana subjects suffered from increased predation: the H. erato chestertonii phenotype was found to be unfavorable in Costa Rica. This is because their markings did not match the Müllerian pattern of the area, so predators could not recognize their distastefulness.

An approximately 50-kb area in the intergenic region near the gene is shared by H. erato and other Heliconius, which contains cis-regulatory elements that control expression of optix. The clade containing Heliconius erato radiated before Heliconius melpomene, establishing the wing pattern diversity found in both species of butterfly. A genetic divide exists between the subspecies on either side of the Andes mountains, resulting in two distinct clades. The eastern clade is from Amazonia, southeastern Brazil, and Guiana, and consists of the subspecies dingus, emma, lativitta, phyllis, notabilis, favorinus, erato, hydara, and venustus. The western clade is from Central America and the Pacific slope of South America and consists of petiverana, hydara, venus, guarica, and cyrbia. This distinction is confirmed by sequence divergence: there is more divergence between the clades and less divergence within each clade. In addition, while there are similar haplotypes between the clades, they result in drastically different phenotypes - likely due to changes in genetic pathways for wing pattern during independent evolution. Mitochondrial DNA invariability also suggests recent radiation of these clades, probably within the last 200,000 years. These findings are consistent with the Pleistocene refugia hypothesis: in the late Pleistocene epoch, climate change reduced once widespread habitable forest areas, resulting in allopatric speciation.  Mating  \\"H. erato\\" mating Males scout out females during the day and often mate with females as they emerge from the chrysalis. Many males sit at female pupae waiting for them to emerge and are undisturbed by any commotion. Females mate with only one male at a time and can reproduce throughout life. All subspecies can potentially mate across subspecies, but interspecies offspring are not common. These offspring only survive well in extremely specific hybrid regions and are unsuccessful elsewhere because their unusual recombinant phenotype attracts more predators.  Pheromones  Adult males have androconial scales which disseminate pheromones to attract mates. Males transfer an anti- aphrodisiac to females during copulation, which repulses and repels other potential mates from the female. It smells similar to phenylcarbylamine, or witch hazel. It emanates from two external protrusions on the abdomen of the female, which are adjacent to yellow glands that are thought to store the pheromone. The pheromone is rarely detected in males as they store it internally. The odor on females can last for weeks, even months, and is advantageous as neither sex wastes time or risks injury in subsequent matings. H. erato chestertonii has an odor distinct from other subspecies. No other Lepidoptera exhibit this behavior.  Physiology = Vision  H. erato has compound eyes, meaning that each eye consists of many individual photoreceptor units. H. erato eyes are unique in that they have at least five different kinds of photoreceptors and are sexually dimorphic, despite having sexually monomorphic wing patterns. (Butterflies with sexually dimorphic eyes typically have sexually dimorphic wing patterns.) The males lack protein expression of one of the SW (short-wave) opsins, which are light-sensitive proteins found in the retina. The UV discrimination conferred by this missing protein may cause males to mistake female co-mimics of other species. While inefficient, this option may have evolved because it is less costly than producing and using the UV machinery. Females, on the other hand, use this ability discriminate H. erato males from other co-mimics because they eventually invest more into egg production and can only mate with a few males.  Origins  One study used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data sets to place the origins of H. erato at 2.8 million years ago. H. erato also shows clustering of AFLPs by geography revealing that H. erato originated in western South America.

Early life Elliott was born in Hagerstown, Maryland. His childhood home, the Elliot-Bester House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. He enlisted in the US Navy as a midshipman in April 1804 and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea during the Barbary Wars between 1805 and 1807, serving on board the USS Essex under Commodore James Barron. In June 1807, Elliott was on board USS Chesapeake when Commodore Barron was forced to allow a search of the ship by HMS Leopard. War of 1812 Elliott won promotion to lieutenant in April 1810 and was assigned to Lake Erie to oversee construction of the US naval squadron on Lake Erie upon the outbreak of the War of 1812. On 8 October 1812, he and Army Captain Nathan Towson captured the British brigs and , formerly the United States brig Adams, anchored near the British Fort Erie in the upper reaches of the Niagara River. Caledonia escaped to an American port with a load of furs and became the USS Caledonia. Detroit was swept down the Niagara River into range of the British guns. Elliott battled the shore emplacement until his ammunition ran out and then beached the ship on Squaw Island (today known as Unity Island) and fled to the American side of the river. British and American guns destroyed the beached ship. Elliott and Towson were later commended for this action by Congress. In February 1813, however, Elliott was replaced as commander of the Lake Erie squadron by Master Commandant Oliver H. Perry. Transferred to Lake Ontario, Elliott served under Commodore Isaac Chauncey as captain on board the flagship the , and took part in the Battle of York on 27 April 1813 and the Battle of Fort George on 27 May. He was promoted to master commandant in July and reassigned to the Lake Erie squadron, to serve as Commodore Perry's second-in-command. He felt Perry had insufficient combat experience, and was particularly critical of Perry's choice of Presque Isle for his shipyard. Battle of Lake Erie During the Battle of Lake Erie against a British squadron under Captain Robert Barclay on 10 September, Elliott commanded the brig . Perry commanded the Niagaras sister-ship, . In the center of the American line of battle, the Niagara was astern of the Caledonia which in turn was astern of the Lawrence. During the early stages of the battle, the Lawrence fought alone against several of the heaviest British ships while the Niagara was scarcely engaged. After the Lawrence was battered into a wreck, Perry took command of the Niagara while Elliott was dispatched by boat to urge the smaller American gunboats at the rear of the line of battle into closer action. The battle ended with the surrender of the entire British squadron. Elliott won distinction for his actions and official praise from Perry, and was given command of the Lake Erie squadron the next month. There was nevertheless controversy over his actions during the battle. Some (including Perry) suspected that he had deliberately held Niagara out of the battle in the beginning, and they would feud over this point to the end of their lives.

In addition to the medals, Elliott and Perry each received an equal share of the prize money ($7,140.00 apiece) for the capture of the British squadron at Lake Erie. In recognition of Perry's position as commodore of the squadron, Congress voted Perry an additional payment of $5,000.00, which became a source of consternation for Elliott. In 1818 Elliott was elected as an honorary member of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati. Conflict between Perry and Elliott Even before the medals were presented, Elliott and Perry became embroiled in a thirty-year-long controversy over their respective conduct and fault in the battle, extending even beyond Perry's death in 1819. Perry claimed that Elliott had failed to offer timely support; Elliott decried lack of communication and signals on Perry's part. In August 1818 Perry drew up a list of charges against Elliott but was, apparently, dissuaded by the Secretary of the Navy against formally filing them.Skaggs, David Curtis. Perry Triumphant (April 2009 Volume 23, Number 2) Naval History Magazine United States Naval Institute.National Park Service, Oliver Hazard Perry. Perry left his list of charges and specifications with his friend Commodore Stephen Decatur when he left on his diplomatic mission to Venezuela in 1819, during which he died. Elliott served as the second to Captain James Barron in the duel in which Barron killed Decatur in 1820. Decatur's widow published the charges made by Perry years later as she held Elliott to be at least partially responsible for her husband's death. Later career Elliott commanded the sloop USS Ontario during the Second Barbary War, and was promoted to Captain in 1818, serving on a naval commission selecting sites for navy yards, lighthouses, and other coastal fortifications, until 1822. In 1820, Elliott was second to Commodore James Barron when the latter fatally shot Stephen Decatur in a duel. He was transferred to the Brazil Squadron in 1825, served as captain of the USS Cyane for two years, and later commanded the West Indies Squadron from 1829 to 1832. Elliott was appointed commander of the Boston Navy Yard in 1833 and of the frigate USS Constitution and the Mediterranean Squadron from 3 March 1835 to 18 August 1838. During the Mediterranean assignment, he was charged with minor offenses by several of his junior officers, including using his official position for personal gain and transporting animals he had purchased aboard Constitution. Elliott was recalled to the United States in 1838. He was politically unpopular at the time (possibly stemming back to his performance during the Battle of Lake Erie and subsequent feud with Perry), and was convicted of these charges and suspended from duty for four years until the remaining charges were dismissed by President John Tyler in October 1843. Appointed commander of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in December 1844, Elliott remained there until his death on 10 December 1845. He is buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia. After being overgrown for many years, his grave was re- identified in 2012.

He was concerned in his works with free trade, Jewish emancipation and American independence. He became Dean of Gloucester. Life He was born at Laugharne, Carmarthenshire; his father inherited a small estate near Aberystwyth, and sent his son to Ruthin School, Denbighshire. Tucker obtained an exhibition at St John's College, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1736, M.A. in 1739, and DD in 1755. In 1737 he became curate of St. Stephen's Church in Bristol, and two years later rector of All Saints' Church in the same city. He was appointed to a minor canonry in the cathedral, and was noticed by Bishop Joseph Butler, to whom he was for a time domestic chaplain. On the death of Alexander Stopford Catcott in 1749 Tucker was appointed by the chancellor to the rectory of St. Stephen's. In 1754 Robert Nugent was elected for Bristol, supported by Tucker; Nugent's influence probably contributed to his preferment. He was appointed to the third prebendal stall at Bristol on 28 October 1756, and on 13 July 1758 as Dean of Gloucester. Tucker, as Dean of Gloucester, saw something of William Warburton, who became bishop in 1759, having previously been Dean of Bristol. They did not like each other, and, according to Tucker, the bishop said that the dean made a religion of his trade and a trade of his religion. (According to another version, the person said to make a trade of his religion was Samuel Squire, who succeeded Warburton as Dean of Bristol.) He became infirm, and in 1790 asked to resign his rectory at Bristol on condition that his curate might succeed to it. The chancellor refused to give the required promise, until, at Tucker's request, his petitioners signed a petition on behalf of the curate. Tucker then resigned, and the curate was appointed. Tucker died on 4 November 1799 and was buried in the south transept of Gloucester Cathedral, where a monument was erected to his memory. Works and views 18th century engraving of Josiah Tucker His first published work was an attack on Methodism. Tucker became conspicuous in the controversy which arose in 1771 as to the proposed abolition of clerical subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles. He defended the Church of England against Andrew Kippis, but said that some relaxation of the terms of subscription was desirable. At Bristol Tucker took an interest in matters of politics and trade. Recent research has shown how he was influenced by the meta-ethics and moral philosophy of Bishop Butler, which he transposed into Christian economic discourse at about mid-century.Peter Xavier Price, 'LIBERTY, POVERTY AND CHARITY IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF JOSIAH TUCKER AND JOSEPH BUTLER', Modern Intellectual History (2017), 1-30. doi:10.1017/S1479244317000518. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern- intellectual-history/article/liberty-poverty-and-charity-in-the-political- economy-of-josiah-tucker-and-joseph- butler/E3B56A0D455E3AD634E53901B95C3318#fndtn-information After some early tracts he first became generally known by pamphlets in favour of the measures for naturalising foreign Protestants and Jews, a view so unpopular that he was burnt in effigy at Bristol along with his pamphlets. In those Tucker was supporting Robert Nugent, who in 1753 introduced a bill in Parliament for the naturalisation of foreigners. He made his name as an economist with A Brief Essay on the Advantages and Disadvantages which Respectively Attend France and Great Britain, with Regard to Trade (1749). It was translated into French and may have influenced the later French physiocrats (economistes). Tucker had a reputation for his knowledge of trade, and in 1755 was asked by Thomas Hayter, then bishop of Norwich and royal preceptor, to draw up a treatise called Elements of Commerce and the Theory of Taxes for the instruction of the future king (George III of England). A fragment was privately printed, but it was never completed. He has been suggested as a source of some of Adam Smith's ideas, even if for a century after his death he was dismissed as a pamphleteer writing controversial ephemera on questions of passing interest.A revision in his assessment was in Walter Enerest Clark, Josiah Tucker, Economist: A Study in the History of Economics (New York: Columbia University Press) 1903. He opposed warfare on economic grounds. In 1763 Tucker published a tract against ‘going to war for the sake of trade,’ which was translated by Turgot, who had previously translated one of the naturalisation pamphlets, and The Elements of Commerce and Theory of Taxes (privately printed, 1755Only three copies are known to survive.),translated as Questions sur le commerce in 1753. He wrote in complimentary terms to Tucker some years later, and sent him a copy of the 'Réflexions sur la Formation des Richesses'. He mentions a visit of Tucker to Paris, but they were not personally acquainted. His assertion as early as 1749 that the American colonies would seek independence as soon as they no longer needed Britain has brought him to the attention of American historians. He consistently wrote in favour of American independence through the American Revolutionary War. He wrote pamphlets, including A Series of Answers to Certain Popular Objections Against Separating from the Rebellious Colonies (1776). Tucker argued with both Edmund Burke and John Wilkes over attitudes to Britain's American colonies and took a distinctive position on the American War of Independence. As early as 1766, he thought a separation inevitable. But he was also hostile to the Americans. He maintained in pamphlets that a separation from the colonies was desirable. He held that the supposed advantage of the colonial trade to the mother country was a delusion. On the other hand, he maintained that the colonies turned adrift would fall out with each other, and be glad to return to political union. The policy pleased nobody in England, and Tucker, though his views were approved in later years by many of the laisser-faire economists, was for a time treated as a Cassandra, a name under which he published in the newspapers. The most popular of his American tracts was Cui Bono? in the form of letters addressed to Jacques Necker (1781), arguing that the war was a mistake for all the nations concerned. In political theory he was an opponent of the social contract theory which held all the mainstream writers of his day. In 1781 he published A Treatise Concerning Civil Government, attacking John Locke's principles as tending to democracy, and supporting the British constitution. In 1785 he again applied his theories to the disputes about Irish trade with Great Britain. Tucker was an advocate for increase in British population, to the extent that he advocated a tax on bachelors; he welcomed immigrants and regretted the emigration to America. He embraced the free market, writing against monopoly in all its forms including the exclusive rights of overseas trading companies like the East India Company, decrying restrictive guild rules of apprenticeship, the Navigation Acts and other impediments to the rule of the unfettered marketplace. Family Tucker's first wife was the widow of Francis Woodward of Grimsbury, Gloucestershire, and he educated his stepson, Richard Woodward, who subsequently became dean of Clogher and bishop of Cloyne. In 1781 Tucker married his housekeeper, Mrs. Crowe. References * Josiah Tucker Index Notes ;Attribution Further reading * * Clark W.

He was one of the leading portrait painters in Antwerp and is best known for his sensitive portraits, in particular of children and families. He was also successful in other genres including history, religious and genre painting. He was a regular collaborator with Rubens. Life He was born in Hulst near Antwerp, now in the Dutch province of Zeeland. Little is known of his childhood. His father moved with his family to Antwerp in 1596.Vivien Gaston, A Powerful Appearance of Life: Cornelis de Vos’s Mother and child Cornelis and his younger brothers Paul and Jan (or Hans) studied under the little-known painter David Remeeus (1559–1626). In 1599 de Vos is mentioned as Remeeus' pupil while on 8 May 1604 he is referred to as the chief assistant of Remeeus.Cornelis de Vos at the Netherlands Institute for Art History On 29 April 1604, de Vos petitioned the Antwerp City Council for a pass that would allow him to travel. This was a necessary procedure for artists who wished to be trained abroad. It is not known whether the young artist actually left the city to study abroad. De Vos joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1608 at the age of 24.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 639–654 When he became a citizen of Antwerp in 1616 he listed his occupation as an art dealer.Katlijne Van der Stighelen and Arnout Balis. \\"Vos, de (i).\\" Grove Art Online.

The couple had 6 children.Matthias Depoorter, Cornelis de Vos at barokinvlaanderen His sister Margaretha married the prominent animal painter Frans Snyders. These marriages confirmed and solidified de Vos' role in Antwerp's artistic life. In 1619 de Vos served as the dean of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp. The same year he petitioned the Antwerp city council for permission to frequent the Saint- Germain market in Paris as an art dealer. In 1620 de Vos was elected high dean of the Guild of Saint Luke in recognition of his status in the city. Portrait of Abraham Grapheus De Vos developed a busy practice as a painter, particularly of portraits. In 1620 he painted the portrait of the painter Abraham Grapheus (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). He donated the work to the painters' chamber of the Guild of Saint Luke. De Vos received multiple commissions for family portraits from local patrons such as the wealthy merchant Joris Vekemans who ordered a portrait cycle of his family members in 1624. In 1627 he enjoyed royal patronage when 6 royal portraits were commissioned by respectively Philip IV of Spain, the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, Henri III of France, Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici. He also worked on commissions from religious institutions. In 1628 he painted his only known landscape, a View of Hulst, which he donated to his home town where it is still displayed in the city hall.Schilderij \\"Gezicht op Hulst\\" terug in Hulst During this period of busy activity as a painter de Vos continued to operate an art dealership. He also created works specifically for export, primarily to Spain. Cornelis de Vos was one of the artists working on the decorations for the Joyous Entry into Antwerp of the new governor of the Habsburg Netherlands Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand in 1635. Rubens was in overall charge of this project. De Vos made decorative paintings after designs by Rubens. One of the hewn-out images that crowned the triumphal arch on the Meir, above the Huidevettersstraat, has been preserved and is attributed to the studio of de Vos (Jupiter and Juno, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). In the period 1636-1638 Rubens' workshop received a large commission to make mythological decorations for the hunting pavilion Torre de la Parada of the Spanish king Philip IV near Madrid. For this project de Vos, together with a number of painters from Rubens' circle, painted decorations after oil sketches by Rubens. Portrait of a young woman De Vos died in Antwerp, where he was buried in the Cathedral of Our Lady. His pupils included Jan Cossiers, Alexander Daemps and Simon de Vos (to whom he was not related). Work=General Cornelis de Vos painted in various genres. He initially painted mainly portraits and mythological, biblical and history scenes. He also created in the late 1620s, some monumental genre paintings. He used the monogram CDVF. His early work shows a clear influence by Rubens in terms of subject matter, motifs and Carravagesque influences. His work is notable for a warm palette and refined rendering of fabrics and gleaming jewelry with an eye for detail.Marjorie E. Wieseman, Cornelis de Vos, in: Peter C. Sutton (ed.), 'The Age of Rubens', exhibition catalogue, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 1993, p. 374 Important features of his personal style were the lucid plasticity of painted flesh and the bright tactility of highlights. He used a fluid and transparent technique and applied fine brushstrokes. While in his later work from the thirties he painted with a looser, more painterly technique and was less precise in rendering the details as shown in the Portrait of a young woman (mid 1630s, Metropolitan Museum of Art), his overall technique remained soft and gentle.Magdalena Łanuszka, A Suggested New Attribution of Seventeenth-Century Flemish Portrait of a Lady in York Art Gallery to Jan Cossiers, Biuletyn Historii Sztuki 1/2017, pp. 87-107 Portraits Portrait of Susanna de Vos De Vos was most successful as a painter of individual and group portraits, a genre in which he developed his own style.Ford-Wille, Clare. \\"Vos, Cornelis de.\\" The Oxford Companion to Western Art. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 February 2015. After the departure of Antony van Dyck for England in 1621 and Rubens' absences from Antwerp on diplomatic and artistic missions, de Vos became the leading portraitist of the Antwerp haute-bourgeois and patrician society. His portraits show the influence of van Dyck. He placed his subjects set within restrained but rich interiors. He was able to achieve a sensitive portrayal of the characters of his sitters and the varied textures of their clothes through the use of an even, bright light as well as soft chiaroscuro effects. He only commenced painting full-length portraits after van Dyck's return to Antwerp in 1627. In these portraits the figure is typically placed in front of architecture and an open landscape. He was particularly skilled in painting group portraits as well as portraits of children. While de Vos' portraits exhibit a new fluency of painting style and spontaneity in the depiction of children, this was combined with a simplicity free from rhetoric that harked back to the earlier Flemish masters. De Vos' portraits are able to communicate a relaxed and warm human affection. In his depiction of children he was a master at expressing their assertive personalities and playful energy. This earned him the recognition of patrons commissioned numerous portraits of children or family portraits featuring children. Magdalena and Jan-Baptist de Vos He produced some striking and intimate portraits of his own children. In a Portrait of his daughter Susanna (1617, Städel) he painted his daughter Susanna in a very informal manner. At first sight the picture seems to be a genre painting rather than a portrait of a particular child. It is clear that the painting was intended for personal use in that he depicted his daughter in a very intimate setting munching sweets.Mirjam Neumeister, Changing Images of Childhood: The Children’s Portrait in Netherlandish Art and Its Influence, in: 'Images of Familial Intimacy in Eastern and Western Art', BRILL, 20 Feb 2014, p. 117 In the portrait of his two eldest children Magdalena and Jan-Baptist, de Vos portrays them not from a distance but brought forward close to the viewer's space. Magdalena looks back at the viewer over her shoulder and seems to invite the viewer in while Jan-Baptist leans forward with tilted head and is also staring at the viewer. He has his feet stretched out and the soles of his shoes are visible. In many of his portraits, de Vos included fruit as symbolic attributes for his sitters. In the portrait of his two eldest children Magdalena holds cherries in her right hand and a peach in her left hand. Peaches and cherries are symbols of youth as well as fertility. His family portraits emphasize the notion of family happiness, with marriage and the immediate family as the core values. As de Vos' patrons were mainly from the Antwerp bourgeoisie rather than the aristocracy, he was less pressured to magnify his sitters through rhetorical gestures and courtly graces as is commonly seen in van Dyck's portraits. He represents the relationships among the sitters through sensitive hand gestures often deployed in a complex counterpoint: giving, receiving, touching, reassuring. The achievements of his sitters are displayed through their lavish dress and the expensively decorated interiors while the sitters themselves exude solid, amiable and quiet confidence. History paintings The finding of Moses While Cornelis de Vos was one of Antwerp's leading portrait painters in the first half of the 17th century, he was also a sought-after painter of history pieces. In particular after circa 1635, de Vos, a successful art dealer, likely realized the growing demand for history paintings in the local and international market. From that date onwards he realized history paintings of a greater diversity in subject matter while his portrait production declined. De Vos' history paintings relied on compositions of Rubens as their initial inspiration. An example of his can be seen in The Finding of Moses (c. 1631–1635, auctioned by Christie's on 6 May 2008, Amsterdam, lot 82). This painting goes back on a lost painting by Rubens with the same composition and subject matter, which is only known through a copy in a private collection in Geneva.Cornelis de Vos, The Finding of Moses at Christie's From 1624 onwards, Cornelis de Vos abandoned his thickly produced brush strokes for a lighter painting style and placed landscapes in the background. This change likely happened under the influence of Rubens. Starting from circa 1630, his compositions became less relief-like and his figures were placed more realistically in the space. The landscape also gradually got more attention while facial expressions became more intensive and the architecture in the background more developed. These changes followed contemporary developments in the Baroque style. Genre paintings Players and courtesans under a tent Less well-known are the genre paintings of Cornelis de Vos. These resemble the Caravaggio-influenced compositions of his contemporaries and pupils like Jan Cossiers, Simon de Vos and Theodoor Rombouts. An example is The card game (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm), which depicts players at a card game, a theme which was very popular with the Flemish followers of Caravaggio. The composition is also known through an engraving made by Alexander Voet in the 1630s (Royal Collection), which clearly identifies Cornelis de Vos as the author of the original painting.Alexander Voet, The card Players at the Royal Trust Collection Another variation on the theme of players, Players and courtesans under a tent (Musée de Picardie), has been attributed to de Vos based on its similarity with the work in Stockholm. Previously it was attributed to the French follower of Caravaggio, Valentin de Boulogne.Jeu de cartes aux armées at the Musée de Picardie Another genre composition involving backgammon players referred to as The game of backgammon (c. 1630, Musée Boucher-de-Perthes) is attributed to Cornelis de Vos. Collaborations Allegory of Earth, a collaboration with Paul de Vos Cornelis de Vos often collaborated with fellow artists as was common in Antwerp at the time. He painted the staffage in still lifes by his brother-in-law Frans Snyders and in return his brother Paul and Frans Snyders painted the fruit, animals, silver plate and armour in his own work. Jan Wildens, another brother-in-law, assisted with the landscapes in many of his works. De Vos was a frequent collaborator of Rubens. Around 1617 he painted two panels, the Adoration of the shepherds and the Presentation in the Temple, that were part of a series of paintings on the theme of the \\"Mystery of the Rosary Cycle\\" in which other local painters, including Rubens (who oversaw the project), van Dyck, and Jacob Jordaens participated. De Vos' two paintings joined the 13 paintings made by these other painters in Antwerp's St. Paul's Church. Here they flanked Caravaggio's Madonna of the Rosary, which was placed in the church in 1620. While Caravaggio's masterwork was later stolen by the Austrian masters of the Southern Netherlands, de Vos' works are still in the St. Paul's Church.Sirjacobs, Raymond. Antwerpen Sint- Pauluskerk Rubens en de mysteries van de rozenkrans. Antwerp: Sint- Paulusvrienden, 2004 The triumph of Bacchus De Vos assisted Rubens with the large commissions of the Rubens workshop in the 1630s. He worked for Rubens on the Joyous Entry of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, a project for which he painted twelve royal portraits after Rubens' designs. Between 1636 and 1638 he, along with his brother Paul and many other Antwerp artists, assisted Rubens in decorating the Torre de la Parada, a hunting lodge of Philip IV of Spain near Madrid. Cornelis contributed four paintings on mythological themes to the series made for the Torre de la Parada: The triumph of Bacchus, The birth of Venus, Apollo and the Python and Daphne chased by Apollo. These works are now in the collection of the Prado Museum. They were based on designs by Rubens which have also been preserved. This makes it possible to compare the designs by Rubens with the works completed by Cornelis de Vos. In The triumph of Bacchus de Vos' brush stroke is less energetic and free than that displayed in the Rubens sketch. De Vos' treatment of the faces also differs in that they are less expressive and dramatic than in the sketch.Cornelis de Vos, El triunfo de Baco at the Prado Portrait of a lady with her daughter While de Vos' collaborations with Rubens on projects in the 1630s appear not to have influenced his style, they did influence his technique.

Naples, Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele III, MS I B 18 is a fragment of 5th century manuscript of the Old Testament written in uncials in the Sahidic dialect of the Coptic language. The manuscript has only 8 surviving folios and includes the text from Job 40:8 to Proverbs 3:19. On folio 4 verso there is a large pen drawing illustrating Job and his daughters. Job is pictured as a bearded man wearing a crown and short tunic. His daughters wear tunics with jewels and diadems. The iconography of Job is very different in this manuscript from that in later centuries. Here he is seen as a royal figure while in later portrayals he is seen as humbled and sitting on a dung heap. This miniature, although not executed by a skilled hand provides an important example of Coptic art in the period of transition from the Hellenistic tradition to a more linear, abstract style. The manuscript was part of a collection of Coptic manuscripts made by Cardinal Stefano Borgia (1731-1804) and was included in the Museo Borgiano in Velletri. In 1821 the manuscript was sold by Countess Adelaide Borgia to the Biblioteca Borbonica in Naples, which later became the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III. References * Crinelli, Lorenzo.

Polynomial factorization is one of the fundamental components of computer algebra systems. The first polynomial factorization algorithm was published by Theodor von Schubert in 1793.FT Schubert: De Inventione Divisorum Nova Acta Academiae Scientiarum Petropolitanae v.11, p. 172-182(1793) Leopold Kronecker rediscovered Schubert's algorithm in 1882 and extended it to multivariate polynomials and coefficients in an algebraic extension. But most of the knowledge on this topic is not older than circa 1965 and the first computer algebra systems: > When the long-known finite step algorithms were first put on computers, they > turned out to be highly inefficient. The fact that almost any uni- or > multivariate polynomial of degree up to 100 and with coefficients of a > moderate size (up to 100 bits) can be factored by modern algorithms in a few > minutes of computer time indicates how successfully this problem has been > attacked during the past fifteen years. (Erich Kaltofen, 1982) Nowadays, modern algorithms and computers can quickly factor univariate polynomials of degree more than 1000 having coefficients with thousands of digits.An example of degree 2401, taking 7.35 seconds, is found in Section 4 in: Hart, van Hoeij, Novocin: Practical Polynomial Factoring in Polynomial Time ISSAC'2011 Proceedings, p. 163-170 (2011). Formulation of the question Polynomial rings over the integers or over a field are unique factorization domains. This means that every element of these rings is a product of a constant and a product of irreducible polynomials (those that are not the product of two non-constant polynomials). Moreover, this decomposition is unique up to multiplication of the factors by invertible constants. Factorization depends on the base field. For example, the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every polynomial with complex coefficients has complex roots, implies that a polynomial with integer coefficients can be factored (with root-finding algorithms) into linear factors over the complex field C. Similarly, over the field of reals, the irreducible factors have degree at most two, while there are polynomials of any degree that are irreducible over the field of rationals Q. The question of polynomial factorization makes sense only for coefficients in a computable field whose every element may be represented in a computer and for which there are algorithms for the arithmetic operations. Fröhlich and Shepherson give examples of such fields for which no factorization algorithm can exist. The fields of coefficients for which factorization algorithms are known include prime fields (i.e., the field of rationals and prime modular arithmetic) and their finitely generated field extensions. Integer coefficients are also tractable. Kronecker's classical method is interesting only from a historical point of view; modern algorithms proceed by a succession of: * Square-free factorization * Factorization over finite fields and reductions: * From the multivariate case to the univariate case. * From coefficients in a purely transcendental extension to the multivariate case over the ground field (see below). * From coefficients in an algebraic extension to coefficients in the ground field (see below). * From rational coefficients to integer coefficients (see below). * From integer coefficients to coefficients in a prime field with p elements, for a well chosen p (see below). Primitive part–content factorization In this section, we show that factoring over Q (the rational numbers) and over Z (the integers) is essentially the same problem. The content of a polynomial p ∈ Z[X], denoted \\"cont(p)\\", is, up to its sign, the greatest common divisor of its coefficients. The primitive part of p is primpart(p)=p/cont(p), which is a primitive polynomial with integer coefficients. This defines a factorization of p into the product of an integer and a primitive polynomial. This factorization is unique up to the sign of the content. It is a usual convention to choose the sign of the content such that the leading coefficient of the primitive part is positive. For example, : -10x^2 + 5x + 5 = (-5) (2x^2 - x - 1) \\\\, is a factorization into content and primitive part. Every polynomial q with rational coefficients may be written :q = \\\\frac{p}{c}, where p ∈ Z[X] and c ∈ Z: it suffices to take for c a multiple of all denominators of the coefficients of q (for example their product) and p = cq. The content of q is defined as: :\\\\text{cont} (q) =\\\\frac{\\\\text{cont} (p)}{c}, and the primitive part of q is that of p. As for the polynomials with integer coefficients, this defines a factorization into a rational number and a primitive polynomial with integer coefficients. This factorization is also unique up to the choice of a sign. For example, : \\\\frac{x^5}{3} + \\\\frac{7x^2}{2} + 2x + 1 = \\\\frac{2x^5 + 21x^2 + 12x + 6}{6} is a factorization into content and primitive part. Gauss proved that the product of two primitive polynomials is also primitive (Gauss's lemma). This implies that a primitive polynomial is irreducible over the rationals if and only if it is irreducible over the integers. This implies also that the factorization over the rationals of a polynomial with rational coefficients is the same as the factorization over the integers of its primitive part. Similarly, the factorization over the integers of a polynomial with integer coefficients is the product of the factorization of its primitive part by the factorization of its content. In other words, an integer GCD computation reduces the factorization of a polynomial over the rationals to the factorization of a primitive polynomial with integer coefficients, and the factorization over the integers to the factorization of an integer and a primitive polynomial. Everything that precedes remains true if Z is replaced by a polynomial ring over a field F and Q is replaced by a field of rational functions over F in the same variables, with the only difference that \\"up to a sign\\" must be replaced by \\"up to the multiplication by an invertible constant in F\\". This reduces the factorization over a purely transcendental field extension of F to the factorization of multivariate polynomials over F. Square-free factorization If two or more factors of a polynomial are identical, then the polynomial is a multiple of the square of this factor. In the case of univariate polynomials, this results in multiple roots. In this case, then the multiple factor is also a factor of the polynomial's derivative (with respect to any of the variables, if several). In the case of univariate polynomials over the rationals (or more generally over a field of characteristic zero), Yun's algorithm exploits this to efficiently factorize the polynomial into square-free factors, that is, factors that are not a multiple of a square. To factorize the initial polynomial, it suffices to factorize each square-free factor. Square-free factorization is therefore the first step in most polynomial factorization algorithms. Yun's algorithm extends this to the multivariate case by considering a multivariate polynomial as a univariate polynomial over a polynomial ring. In the case of a polynomial over a finite field, Yun's algorithm applies only if the degree is smaller than the characteristic, because, otherwise, the derivative of a non-zero polynomial may be zero (over the field with p elements, the derivative of a polynomial in xp is always zero). Nevertheless, a succession of GCD computations, starting from the polynomial and its derivative, allows one to compute the square-free decomposition; see Polynomial factorization over finite fields#Square-free factorization. Classical methods This section describes textbook methods that can be convenient when computing by hand. These methods are not used for computer computations because they use integer factorization, which is currently slower than polynomial factorization. Obtaining linear factors All linear factors with rational coefficients can be found using the rational root test. If the polynomial to be factored is a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_1x + a_0, then all possible linear factors are of the form b_1x-b_0, where b_1 is an integer factor of a_n and b_0 is an integer factor of a_0. All possible combinations of integer factors can be tested for validity, and each valid one can be factored out using polynomial long division. If the original polynomial is the product of factors at least two of which are of degree 2 or higher, this technique only provides a partial factorization; otherwise the factorization is complete. In particular, if there is exactly one non-linear factor, it will be the polynomial left after all linear factors have been factorized out. In the case of a cubic polynomial, if the cubic is factorizable at all, the rational root test gives a complete factorization, either into a linear factor and an irreducible quadratic factor, or into three linear factors. Kronecker's method Since integer polynomials must factor into integer polynomial factors, and evaluating integer polynomials at integer values must produce integers, the integer values of a polynomial can be factored in only a finite number of ways, and produce only a finite number of possible polynomial factors. For example, consider :f(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 2. If this polynomial factors over Z, then at least one of its factors must be of degree two or less. We need three values to uniquely fit a second degree polynomial. We'll use f(0) = 2, f(1) = 6 and f(-1) = 2. If one of those values is 0, then we have found a root (and so a factor). If none are 0, then each one has a finite number of divisors. Now, 2 can only factor as :1×2, 2×1, (−1)×(−2), or (−2)×(−1). Therefore, if a second degree integer polynomial factor exists, it must take one of the values :1, 2, −1, or −2 at x=0, and likewise at x=-1. There are eight different ways to factor 6 (one for each divisor of 6), so there are :4×4×8 = 128 possible combinations, of which half can be discarded as the negatives of the other half, corresponding to 64 possible second degree integer polynomials that must be checked. These are the only possible integer polynomial factors of f(x). Testing them exhaustively reveals that :p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 constructed from p(0)=1, p(1)=3 and p(-1)=1, factors f(x). Dividing f by p gives the other factor q(x) = x^3 - x + 2, so that f = pq. Now one can test recursively to find factors of p and q. It turns out they both are irreducible over the integers, so that the irreducible factorization of f is Van der Waerden, Sections 5.4 and 5.6 :f(x) = p(x)q(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^3 - x + 2). Modern methods=Factoring over finite fieldsFactoring univariate polynomials over the integers If f(x) is a univariate polynomial over the integers, assumed to be content-free and square-free, one starts by computing a bound B such that any factor g(x) has coefficients of absolute value bounded by B. This way, if m is an integer larger than 2B, and if g(x) is known modulo m, then g(x) can be reconstructed from its image mod m. The Zassenhaus algorithm proceeds as follows. First, choose a prime number p such that the image of f(x) mod p remains square-free, and of the same degree as f(x). Then factor f(x) mod p. This produces integer polynomials f_1(x),...,f_r(x) whose product matches f(x) mod p. Next, apply Hensel lifting; this updates the f_i(x) in such a way that their product matches f(x) mod p^a, where a is chosen in such a way that p^a is larger than 2B. Modulo p^a, the polynomial f(x) has (up to units) 2^r factors: for each subset of {f_1(x),...,f_r(x)}, the product is a factor of f(x) mod p^a. However, a factor modulo p^a need not correspond to a so-called \\"true factor\\": a factor of f(x) in Z[x]. For each factor mod p^a, we can test if it corresponds to a \\"true\\" factor, and if so, find that \\"true\\" factor, provided that p^a exceeds 2B. This way, all irreducible \\"true\\" factors can be found by checking at most 2^r cases. This is reduced to 2^{r-1} cases by skipping complements. If f(x) is reducible, the number of cases is reduced further by removing those f_i(x) that appear in an already found \\"true\\" factor. Zassenhaus algorithm processes each case (each subset) quickly, however, in the worst case, it considers an exponential number of cases. The first polynomial time algorithm for factoring rational polynomials was discovered by Lenstra, Lenstra and Lovász and is an application of Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm, the \\"LLL algorithm\\". A simplified version of the LLL factorization algorithm is as follows: calculate a complex (or p-adic) root α of the polynomial f(x) to high precision, then use the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm to find an approximate linear relation between 1, α, α2, α3, ... with integer coefficients, which might be an exact linear relation and a polynomial factor of f(x). One can determine a bound for the precision that guarantees that this method produces either a factor, or an irreducibility proof. Although this method is polynomial time, it is not used in practice because the lattice has high dimension and huge entries, which makes the computation slow. The exponential complexity in the algorithm of Zassenhaus comes from a combinatorial problem: how to select the right subsets of f_1(x),...,f_r(x). State of the art factoring implementations work in a manner similar to Zassenhaus, except that the combinatorial problem is translated to a lattice problem that is then solved by LLL.M. van Hoeij: Factoring polynomials and the knapsack problem. Journal of Number Theory, 95, 167-189, (2002). In this approach, LLL is not used to compute coefficients of factors, instead, it is used to compute vectors with r entries in {0,1} that encode the subsets of f_1(x),...,f_r(x) that correspond to the irreducible \\"true\\" factors. Factoring over algebraic extensions (Trager's method) We can factor a polynomial p(x) \\\\in K[x] , where the field K is a finite extension of \\\\mathbb{Q}. First, using square-free factorization, we may suppose that the polynomial is square-free. Next we write L= K[x]/p(x) explicitly as an algebra over \\\\mathbb{Q}. We next pick a random element \\\\alpha \\\\in L. By the primitive element theorem, \\\\alpha generates L over \\\\mathbb{Q} with high probability. If this is the case, we can compute the minimal polynomial, q(y)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}[y] of \\\\alpha over \\\\mathbb{Q}. Factoring :q(y) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n} q_i(y) over \\\\mathbb{Q}[y], we determine that :L = \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\alpha] = \\\\mathbb{Q}[y]/q(y) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbb{Q}[y]/q_i(y) (notice that L is a reduced ring since p(x) is square-free), where \\\\alpha corresponds to the element (y,y,\\\\ldots,y). Note that this is the unique decomposition of L as a product of fields. Hence this decomposition is the same as :\\\\prod_{i=1}^m K[x]/p_i(x) where :p(x) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^m p_i(x) is the factorization of p(x) over K[x]. By writing x\\\\in L and generators of K as a polynomials in \\\\alpha, we can determine the embeddings of x and K into the components \\\\mathbb{Q}[y]/q_i(y)=K[x]/p_i(x). By finding the minimal polynomial of x in this ring, we have computed p_i(x), and thus factored p(x) over K.

As in the case of the Macanese pataca which is still in use today, the East Timor unit was based on the silver Mexican dollar coins which were prolific in the wider region in the 19th century. These Mexican dollar coins were in turn the lineal descendants of the Spanish pieces of eight which had been introduced to the region by the Portuguese through Portuguese Malacca, and by the Spanish through the Manila Galleon trade. History The pataca was first introduced in Portuguese Macau and Portuguese Timor in the year 1894, but only as a unit of account for the silver Mexican dollar coins that circulated widely in the region at that time. In 1894, Macau and Portuguese Timor constituted one single administrative entity, but in 1896 Portuguese Timor became autonomous from Macau. In those days there was no single currency in circulation in Macau and East Timor, and trade was dominated by the silver dollar coins, not only of Mexico, but also of China, as well as the British silver trade dollars that were minted for use in Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. In East Timor, the 2½ Gulden coin of the neighbouring Netherlands East Indies also corresponded to a silver dollar. In 1901 in Macau, it was decided to create a purely local currency, and the authorities granted the Banco Nacional Ultramarino exclusive rights to print legal tender banknotes. These pataca banknotes were launched in 1906 at a sterling value of 2s 4d (2 shillings and 4 pence) — the same as the new Straits dollar that was issued in that same year. As in the Straits Settlements, all foreign coinage was outlawed, with the intention that the new currencies should establish their own market values. The Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas, being accustomed to using silver for barter, and so the paper patacas always circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. These Macau banknotes also circulated in East Timor, but in 1912 they were supplemented by local Timor issues for the first time. While the pataca continued at a discount to the silver dollars that were used in silver standard countries such as China and Hong Kong, the Straits dollar was pegged to sterling in a gold exchange standard, so the two currencies then floated apart. In 1935, when China and Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard, the pataca was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a rate of 1 pataca = 5.5 escudos, making it equivalent to the British shilling (since £1 was then equivalent to 110 escudos) and putting it officially at a 3d sterling discount in relation to the Hong Kong unit, and at a 1s 4d discount in relation to the Straits dollar. In 1942, during the Second World War, the pataca was replaced by Japanese issues of the Netherlands Indies gulden at par. The gulden had been on the gold standard until the 1930s, and had risen in value against the pataca so that the pataca was now closer in value to 1 gulden rather than the 2½ gulden rate that had prevailed around 1900. When the pataca was reintroduced in 1945, it was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a rate of 5.5 escudos = 1 pataca (changed to 5 escudos = 1 pataca in 1949) and fractional coins denominated in avos (100 avos = 1 pataca) were issued for the first time. In 1951, minting of avo coins ceased, even though in 1952 a full set of pataca coinage, including coins denominated in avos and also a pataca coin, was issued in Macau. In 1958, the pataca was replaced by the escudo at the rate of 1 pataca = 5.6 escudos. In 1975, Portuguese Timor was invaded by Indonesia, and Indonesian currency was introduced. When this territory was established as an independent state in 2002, the US dollar was made the official currency. The US dollar was also descended from the Spanish pieces of eight but it broke parity with the silver dollars of south-east Asia and Latin America following the great international silver devaluation of 1873. Coins 10 Avos In 1945, bronze 10 avos, nickel- bronze 20 avos and silver 50 avos coins were introduced. The sizes of these coins matched the Portuguese 20 centavos and 1 and 2½ escudos. Coins were issued until 1951. Banknotes In 1912, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino introduced notes (dated 1910) in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 patacas. 25 patacas notes from Macao also circulated. In 1940, notes of 5, 10 and 50 avos were introduced. Some of these notes were overprints of Macanese notes, as were the 5, 25 and 100 patacas notes introduced in 1945. The same year, specific issues for Timor were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 25 patacas, followed by 20 avos in 1948.

Electoral system All 650 members of the UK Parliament are elected using the first-past-the-post voting system in single member constituencies across the whole of the United Kingdom, where each constituency has its own single representative. Elections All MP positions become simultaneously vacant for elections held on a five-year cycle. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets out that ordinary general elections are held on the first Thursday in May, every five years. However, with approval from Parliament, both the 2017 and 2019 general elections were held earlier than the schedule set by the Act. If a vacancy arises at another time, due to death or resignation, then a constituency vacancy may be filled by a by-election. Under the Representation of the People Act 1981 any MP sentenced to over a year in jail automatically vacates their seat. For certain types of lesser acts of wrongdoing the Recall of MPs Act 2015 mandates that a recall petition is opened; if signed by more than 10% of registered voters within the constituency the seat is vacated.  Eligibility  To be eligible to stand as an MP a person must be at least 18 years old and be a citizen of the UK, a Commonwealth nation, or Ireland. A person is not required to be registered to vote, nor are there any restrictions regarding where a candidate is resident. The House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 outlaws the holders of various positions from being MPs. These include civil servants, police officers, members of the armed forces, and judges. Members of the House of Lords are not permitted to hold Commons seats. Members of legislatures outside of the Commonwealth are excluded, with the exemption of the Irish legislature. Additionally, members of the Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament or the Northern Ireland Assembly are also ineligible for the Commons according to the Wales and Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts respectively, passed in 2014. People who are bankrupt cannot stand to be MPs. The Representation of the People Act 1981 excludes persons who are currently serving a prison sentence of a year or more. Title Members of Parliament are entitled to use the post nominal title MP. MPs are only referred to as \\"honorable\\" as a courtesy during debates in the House of Commons or if they are the child of a peer. Those who are members of the Privy Council use the form The Right Honourable (The Rt Hon. or Rt Hon.) Name MP. Responsibilities Theoretically, contemporary MPs are considered to have two duties, or three if they belong to a political party. Their primary responsibility is to act in the national interest. They must also act in the interests of their constituents where this does not override their primary responsibility. Finally, if they belong to a political party, they may act in the interests of that party, subordinate to the other two responsibilities.

It is usually woven with a plain weave, twill or herringbone structure. Colour effects in the yarn may be obtained by mixing dyed wool before it is spun. Tweeds are an icon of traditional Scottish and Irish clothing, being desirable for informal outerwear, due to the material being moisture-resistant and durable. Tweeds are made to withstand harsh climates and are commonly worn for outdoor activities such as shooting and hunting, in both Ireland and Scotland. In Ireland, tweed manufacturing is now most associated with County Donegal but originally covered the whole country . In Scotland, tweed manufacturing is most associated with the Isle of Harris in the Hebrides. Etymology The original name of the cloth was tweel, Scots for twill, the material being woven in a twilled rather than a plain pattern. A traditional story has the name coming about almost by chance. Around 1831, a London merchant received a letter from a Hawick firm, Wm. Watson & Sons, Dangerfield Mills about some \\"tweels\\". The merchant misinterpreted the handwriting, understanding it to be a trade-name taken from the River Tweed that flows through the Scottish Borders textile area. The goods were subsequently advertised as Tweed and the name has remained since. Associations Tweed making at a mill in Wales, 1940 Traditionally used for upper-class country clothing like shooting jackets, tweed became popular among the Edwardian middle classes who associated it with the leisurely pursuits of the elite. Due to their durability tweed Norfolk jackets and plus-fours were a popular choice for hunters, cyclists, golfers and early motorists, hence Kenneth Grahame's depiction of Mr. Toad in a Harris Tweed suit. Popular patterns include houndstooth,Dunbar, John Telfer (1984). The Costume of Scotland.

During the 2000s and 2010s, it was not uncommon for members of long-established British and American land- owning families to wear high quality heirloom tweed inherited from their grandparents, some of which pre-dated the Second World War. In modern times, cyclists may wear tweed when they ride vintage bicycles on a Tweed Run. This practice has its roots in the British young fogey and hipster subcultures of the late 2000s and early 2010s, whose adherents appreciate both vintage tweed, and bicycles. Bike in Tweed, Stockholm 2013 Musical instruments Some vintage Danemann upright pianos have a tweed cloth backing to protect the internal mechanism. Occasionally, Scottish bagpipes were covered in tweed as an alternative to tartan wool. The term \\"tweed\\" is used to describe coverings on instrument cables and vintage or retro guitar amplifiers, such as the Fender tweed and Fender Tweed Deluxe. Despite the common terminology, these coverings were cotton twill, and not actually tweed. Types of tweed * Harris Tweed: A handwoven tweed, defined in the Harris Tweed Act 1993 as cloth that is \\"Handwoven by the islanders at their homes in the Outer Hebrides, finished in the Outer Hebrides, and made from pure virgin wool dyed and spun in the Outer Hebrides\\". * Donegal tweed: A handwoven tweed manufactured in County Donegal, Ireland. Donegal has been producing tweed from local materials for centuries. Sheep thrive in the hills and bogs of Donegal, and indigenous plants such as blackberries, gorse (whins), and moss provide dyes. Donegal Tweed has been manufactured in County Donegal Ireland for several centuries, this ancient craft is still kept alive today but a number of handweavers in the Donegal countryside, the town of Ardara is known as the 'Home of Donegal Tweed'. A building known locally as 'The Mart' built around 1900 once housed 60 handweavers from the local area, one of those weavers was Joseph Mulhern who was a weaver in the early part of that century, his sons Peter and Dennis also became handweavers and worked in The Mart from an early age, Dennis later acquired the building and launched his own Donegal Tweed business called Triona Design that continues to make garments using Tweed. * Silk tweed: A fabric made of raw silk with flecks of colour typical of woollen tweed.

The Alexandria campus continued to operate as Alexandria Friends School from 2006-2012. There was on average around 55 students in the Silver Spring Upper School and 15 students in the middle school; the Virginia upper school once had as many as 43 students. Classes at the upper schools averaged about 9 students, and the middle school averaged about 6. Mission statement: \\"Thornton Friends School seeks to inspire and sustain the members of its educational community in their individual and collective search for Truth. Small by design, nurturing of individuals and community, and based on Quaker principles, Thornton Friends School seeks to empower each of its students to build on their innate inspiration, talent and spiritual centers to imagine and realize their vision.\\" History In 1972, Peter and Nancy Kline, both faculty members at Sandy Spring Friends School in Sandy Spring, MD approached their headmaster C. Thornton “Thorny” Brown, and asked permission to begin a separate program for students who either were not working out well at Sandy Spring, or who did not meet the school’s acceptance criteria. Their target student was the “bright underachiever,” and with Thorny’s blessing a separate program was started on the Sandy Spring campus. The Klines first worked out of the infirmary at Sandy Spring, then relocated to a farm house in Brookeville. From there they moved to the school’s Silver Spring location, sharing the building with another program run by Bill and Lynn Godwin. These programs were collectively known as the Interlocking Curriculum School, the highlights of which were the yearly production of Shakespearean plays and a bi-annual trip to England. The school struggled financially, and in 1983 Douglas Price was brought in to make recommendations as to how the school could become more viable. After Peter Kline resigned, Doug took over his classes, and in 1985 became head, succeeding interim head, Don Cassidy. During this time the school was renamed the Thornton Friends School, in honor of Thorny Brown, and the program changed to include five academic periods and the more conventional high school curriculum. Doug Price served as Head until 1998. During his tenure, he was able to put the school on a more sound financial footing while opening the middle school in 1993 and the Northern Virginia upper school in 1997. The middle school was conceived as a feeder school for the upper school, and was run for its first five years by Carl Dolan. Since Carl's untimely death on a bicycle marathon, the school had four leaders, the last, Marcy Seitel, took over as principal in the fall of 2005. The Northern Virginia campus opened as an upper school (grades 9-12) in Alexandria in response to the need for the whole school to grow as well as requests from the local Quaker meeting. Gail Miller was its first principal. Initially Doug Price was principal both of the Maryland upper school and school head, but in 1995 Michael DeHart, then dean of students, became the upper school principal while Doug concentrated on his school head responsibilities. Michael remained in that position for three years, taking over as head when Doug retired at the end of the 1997-1998 school year. Norman Maynard, the last Maryland upper school principal, took over from Michael in August, 1998, and served as the last head of Thornton Friends School in 2009. The Virginia upper school never quite grew to its targeted enrollment, and after a series of personnel changes, Thornton closed it at the end of the 2005-2006 academic year. That school reopened the following fall as the Alexandria Friends School, with students, faculty, and staff from the Thornton Virginia Campus. William Stewart, a teacher at the school, became head of the new school. Under Michael DeHart’s tenure, the Thornton Friends School’s first mission statement was drafted in 2002, signifying the start of an ongoing process to commit to describing and writing down many of the school’s values and processes.

Citing financial difficulties, Thornton closed at the end of the 2008-2009 school year, with both the Silver Spring Middle School and Upper School closing.

The work is generally considered to be the first printed book on the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Biography Maciej Stryjkowski was born around 1547 in Stryków, a town in the Rawa Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. He graduated from a local school in the town of Brzeziny, after which he joined the army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and served in the forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He served in a garrison in Vitebsk under Alexander Guagnini. Title page of Stryjkowski's Chronicle... He was a Pole, but spent most of his life in the Grand Duchy, initially as a soldier. Around 1573, at the age of roughly 25, he retired from active service and became a protégé of Merkelis Giedraitis, the bishop of Samogitia. Eventually, Stryjkowski became a Catholic priest and ended as a provost at the parish of Jurbarkas near the Lithuania–Prussia border. There he devoted his life to writing a monumental chronicle of the lands of Poland–Lithuania, eventually published in Königsberg (today Kaliningrad) in 1582. The book, published under the title of Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia, and all of Ruthenia of Kiev, Moscow, Novgorod...The full title of the book in contemporary Polish language was long Kronika Polska, Litewska, Żmódzka y wszystkiej Rusi Kijowskiey, Moskiewskiey, Siewierskiey(...) y rozmaite przypadki woienne y domowe, pruskich, mazowieckich, pomorskich y inszych krain Królestwu Polskiemu y Wielkiemu Xięstwu Litewskiemu przyległych(...) and included all of the lands of mediaeval Ruthenia listed separately, as well as a short explanation of sources used. Because of that, it is usually referred to by its opening names only. is a classic piece of literature written in the Polish language and detailed much of the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its parts from their legendary roots up to 1581. Some fragments of his work are written in the Lithuanian language. He also encouraged Lithuanian nobility to use the Lithuanian language. The chronicle was a successful compilation of earlier chronicles by Jan Długosz and Maciej Miechowita, but also includes Ruthenian chronicles, folk tales and legends. It instantly gained much fame among the szlachta and it is often argued that Stryjkowski was among the Polish–Lithuanian writers to shape the Lithuanian national identity, as his works were later copied by scores of writers and chroniclers in all parts of the region. Until the 19th century, the works of Stryjkowski were considered to be the basic sources of information on early period of history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was not until the advent of modern historiography that his chronicle started to be criticised and disputed, mainly due to his favour of the magnates, lack of distinction between legends and historic accounts and his theory on the Roman origin of the Lithuanian ruling families. In 1577, Stryjkowski also authored an epic poem On the beginnings of the famed nation of Lithuania (...),As in the case of his chronicle, the full title was O początkach, wywodach, dzielnościach, sprawach rycerskich i domowych sławnego narodu litewskiego, żemojdzkiego i ruskiego, przed tym nigdy od żadnego ani kuszone, ani opisane, z natchnienia Bożego a uprzejmie pilnego doświadczenia, which could be roughly translated as On the beginnings, accounts, virtues, marital and domestic affairs of the famed nations of Lithuania, Samogitia, Ruthenia; never before touched or described by anyone, put down out of God's inspiration and own experience. which however was not published until after Stryjkowski's death. He died around the year 1593, though the exact date and place remain unknown.

While the term is often employed for the removal of the liver from a liver transplant donor, this article will focus on partial resections of hepatic tissue and hepatoportoenterostomy. History The first hepatectomies were reported by Dr. Ichio Honjo (1913-1987) of (Kyoto University) in 1949, and Dr. Jean-Louis Lortat-Jacob (1908-1992) of France in 1952. In the latter case, the patient was a 58-year-old woman diagnosed with colorectal cancer which had metastasized to the liver. Indications Most hepatectomies are performed for the treatment of hepatic neoplasms, both benign or malignant. Benign neoplasms include hepatocellular adenoma, hepatic hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia. The most common malignant neoplasms (cancers) of the liver are metastases; those arising from colorectal cancer are among the most common, and the most amenable to surgical resection. The most common primary malignant tumour of the liver is the hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatectomy may also be the procedure of choice to treat intrahepatic gallstones or parasitic cysts of the liver. Partial hepatectomies are also performed to remove a portion of a liver from a live donor for transplantation. Technique A hepatectomy is considered a major surgery done under general anesthesia. Access is accomplished by laparotomy, typically by a bilateral subcostal (\\"chevron\\") incision, possibly with midline extension (Calne or \\"Mercedes-Benz\\" incision). An anterior approach, one of the most innovative, is made simpler by the liver hanging maneuver. Hepatectomies may be anatomic, i.e. the lines of resection match the limits of one or more functional segments of the liver as defined by the Couinaud classification (cf. liver#Functional anatomy); or they may be non-anatomic, irregular or \\"wedge\\" hepatectomies. Anatomic resections are generally preferred because of the smaller risk of bleeding and biliary fistula; however, non-anatomic resections can be performed safely as well in selected cases.International Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary Association (IHPBA) Terminology for Liver Resections The Pringle manoeuvre is usually performed during a hepatectomy to minimize blood loss - however this can lead to reperfusion injury in the liver due to Ischemia. Complications Bleeding is the most feared technical complication and may be grounds for urgent reoperation. Biliary fistula is also a possible complication, albeit one more amenable to nonsurgical management. Pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pleural effusion are commonplace, and dangerous in patients with underlying lung disease. Infection is relatively rare. Liver failure poses a significant hazard to patients with underlying hepatic disease; this is a major deterrent in the surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. It is also a problem, to a lesser degree, in patients with previous hepatectomies (e.g. repeat resections for reincident colorectal cancer metastases). Results Liver surgery is safe when performed by experienced surgeons with appropriate technological and institutional support. As with most major surgical procedures, there is a marked tendency towards optimal results at the hands of surgeons with high caseloads in selected centres (typically cancer centres and transplantation centres). For optimal results, combination treatment with systemic or regionally infused chemo or biological therapy should be considered. Prior to surgery, cytotoxic agents such as oxaliplatin given systemically for colorectal metastasis, or chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma can significantly decrease the size of the tumor bulk, allowing then for resections which would remove a segment or wedge portion of the liver only. These procedures can also be aided by application of liver clamp (Lin or Chu liver clamp; Pilling no.604113-61995) in order to minimize blood loss. Etymology The word \\"hepatectomy\\" is derived from Greek. In Greek liver is hepar and -ectomy comes from the Greek ektomē, \\"to remove.\\"  See also  * List of surgeries by type References External links  * Oncolex, the cancer encyclopedia, on liver cancer * Video showing laprascopic liver resection. * The Toronto Video Atlas of Liver, Pancreas and Transplant Surgery – Video of Extended Left Hepatectomy procedure * The Toronto Video Atlas of Liver, Pancreas and Transplant Surgery – Video of Standard Left Hepatectomy procedure * The Toronto Video Atlas of Liver, Pancreas and Transplant Surgery – Video of Standard Right Hepatectomy procedure * The Toronto Video Atlas of Liver, Pancreas and Transplant Surgery – Video of Laparoscopic Right Hepatectomy procedure Category:Surgical oncology Category:Hepatology Category:Accessory digestive gland surgery ","title":"Hepatectomy"},{"id":"3776513","text":"building hall towards the water A shiplift is a modern alternative for a slipway, a floating dry dock or a graving dry dock. A shiplift is used to dry dock and launch ships. It consists of a structural platform that is lifted and lowered exactly vertically, synchronously by a number of hoists. First, the platform is lowered underwater, then the ship is floated above the support, and finally the platform with support and ship is lifted and the ship is brought to the level of the quay. Design Nowadays, shiplift are most of the time supplied under rules of a classification authority. Lloyd's Register of Shipping is the authority with most experience in the certification or classification of shiplifts. Whereas \\"shiplift\\" is the word that is normally used, the term used by Lloyd's register is \\"Mechanical Lift Dock\\". It will be discerned between two different kinds of platform design, the articulated and the rigid.See: Lloyds Register, Code for lifting appliances in a marine environment, Chapter 5, par. 1.2.1 The articulated platform has hinged connections between the main and the longitudinal beams. A rigid platform, the beams are bolted or welded together. The Syncrolift® System was invented by Raymond Pearlson, who was later awarded the Sperry Award for the invention, development and worldwide implementation of a new system for lifting ships out of the water for repair and for launching new ship construction.http://www.sperryaward.org/Sperrybrochure2002.pdfSyncrolift. It is important to synchronize the winches. Modern systems use electrical control and drive systems for the winches. Old fashioned electrically driven shiplift systems needed so much starting current that they often could only be used in the weekend when other electrical equipment was not in use. The modern shiplifts however do not have this disadvantage; they can start the movement in any desired curve. The largest Shiplift in the USA is currently being built by Pearlson Shiplift Corporation for US Navy Vessels. https://www.workboat.com/press-releases/pearlson-shiplift-corporation-signs- contract-for-the-largest-shiplift-system-in-the-usa-with-fincanctieri- marinette-marine/ Transfer System Many shiplifts use a transfer system for ships so that the vessels can be transported from the water to a parking place where they can be painted or repaired. One shiplift can serve many parking places, while a dry docking installation can only dock one ship. Ship on a transfer system on a shiplift For large vessels the transfer system consists of a number of trolleys or cradles, supported by high capacity steel wheels. The wheels drive on heavy duty rails. The transport can be one directional, but in order to serve more parking places, two directional systems are used. These two directional systems make use of a traverser carriage or sometimes the wheels of the trolleys can be turned over 90 degrees. Above the wheels often hydraulic cylinders are located so that the ship can be transported upon a so-called \\"Fluid Bed\\". The cylinders are also used to lower the ships on a static support, so that the transfer system with the active elements can be recovered. The Bardex Longitudinal and Lateral Transfer System utilizes remote operated hydraulic, self powered Bogies (trolleys) with passive hydraulic suspension systems. Transfer of 12,000+ ton vesselshttp://www.aluminumship.com/shipbuilding/marine-bardex-hydranautics- shipyard-2248 to and from the Shiplift and across the shipyard is smooth as the suspension compensates for slight elevation changes. This suspension system also means that the shipyard and shiplift pier ‘civil works’ structural bearing design can be designed with lower peak loads. Pleasure Craft Smaller devices called \\"Boat lifts\\" are available that simply raise yachts, sailboats, or small watercraft above the water level at a dock for storage, for reduced maintenance cost and increased security. They can be operated by cables, by hydraulics, or by air flotation and some are \\"drive on\\" to segmented flexing supports. Even smaller, are devices sometimes called \\"Portable boat lifts\\" which are easily transported cranes that allow one person to separate a boat from a trailer by themselves.

It is in the Borough of Dacorum, Tring West and Rural Ward. It is located roughly 5 miles east of Aylesbury and 11 miles north-west of Hemel Hempstead. History The name of the village is likely to derive from 'Mershton', literally Marsh Farm, a reference to its propensity for flooding . By 1751 this had developed into the name Long Marcon . \\"Straggling crossroads place stuck in the dullish, well-watered flatlands north of Tring. The ruined, ivy-covered flint tower is all that remains of a deserted medieval church - a must for the modern-day follower of the Tour of Dr Syntax (Rowlandson). A new church, uninspired in itself, incorporates fragments of the old - chancel arch and windows - and also the Perpendicular aisle piers from Tring parish church. In the main street are plain cottages, a bit of timber-framing and weather-boarding in good harmony. Some thoughtless new development. \\"In 1751 the village pond was the scene of England's last witch-lynching, when Ruth Osborn, the 'witch', was captured and drowned. One of her tormentors ended up gibbeted at Gubblecote Cross (1/2 m. E.), close to the moated site of a deserted medieval village.\\" [From Hertfordshire (a Shell Guide),R. M. Healey, Faber & Faber, London, 1982] In 1751 it is claimed that elderly husband and wife John and Ruth Osborne were both lynched. However it is highly debatable whether this lynching actually happened in Long Marston and it is widely believed that it actually occurred in the village of Wilstone.Long Marston https://archive.is/20130628021924/http://www.longmarston.org/2009/01/the-last- witch-hunt/ Amenities Long Marston is also host to a primary school, Long Marston JMI. The school was built after the original school, built during the Victorian era, was bombed during World War Two. The current school, built in 1951, has gradually grown and extended with the village and its population. Due to transport links improving and more people owning cars, the number of services in Long Marston has slowly diminished. One public house remains, the Queens Head. Historically there were four. The White Hart and the Rose and Crown shut many years ago, but the Boot was a recent loss and quite a severe one for village life as the local shop and Post Office had been relocated there. Now the nearest stores are at Wilstone, Wingrave or Tring. Sport The village is home to Long Marston Cricket Club, one of the most affluent village cricket clubs in the Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire region. The club attracts players of all ages from across the two counties, with many junior teams as well three senior teams which play on Saturdays throughout the summer. There is also a Sunday team that play primarily at home.

Repaglinide is an oral medication used in addition to diet and exercise for blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of action of repaglinide involves promoting insulin release from β-islet cells of the pancreas; like other antidiabetic drugs, a main side effect concern is hypoglycemia. It is sold by Novo Nordisk under the name of Prandin in the United States, GlucoNorm in Canada, Surepost in Japan, Repaglinide in Egypt by EIPICO, and NovoNorm elsewhere. In Japan it is produced by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. Medical uses Repaglinide is an oral medication used in addition to diet and exercise for blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Contraindications Repaglinide is contraindicated in people with: # Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma # Type 1 diabetes # Co-administration with gemfibrozil # Known hypersensitivity to drug or inactive ingredients Adverse events Common adverse events include: Metabolic * Hypoglycemia (31%) Respiratory * Upper respiratory infection (16%) * Sinusitis (6%) * Rhinitis (3%) Gastrointestinal * Nausea (5%) * Diarrhea (5%) * Constipation (3%) * Vomiting (3%) Musculoskeletal * Arthralgia (6%) * Back Pain (5%) Other * Headache (11%) * Paresthesia (3%) Serious adverse events include: * Cardiac ischemia (2%) * Angina (1.8%) * Deaths due to cardiovascular events (0.5%) Special populations Pregnancy category C: safety in pregnant women has not been established. Data is limited, and there is only one case report that notes no complications with the use of repaglinide during pregnancy. Caution should be taken in people with liver disease and decreased kidney function when using this medication. Drug interactions Repaglinide is a major substrate of CYP3A4 and should not be administered concomitantly with gemfibrozil, clarithromycin or azole antifungals such as itraconazole or ketoconazole. Administration of both repaglinide and one or more of these drugs results in an increase in plasma concentration of repaglinide and may lead to hypoglycemia. Co-administration of repaglinide and clopidogrel (a CYP2C8 inhibitor) may lead to a significant decrease in blood glucose levels due to a drug-drug interaction. In fact, using these drugs together for even one day can cause repaglinide levels to increase over 5-fold...and may lead to significant hypoglycemia. Repaglinide should not be combined with sulfonylurea, because they have the same mechanism of action. Mechanism of action Repaglinide lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta islet cells of the pancreas. It achieves this by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels in the membrane of the beta cells. This depolarizes the beta cells, opening the cells' calcium channels, and the resulting calcium influx induces insulin secretion. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: repaglinide has a 56% bioavailability when absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability is reduced when taken with food; the maximum concentration decreases by 20%. Distribution: The protein binding of repalglinide to albumin is greater than 98%. Metabolism: repaglinide is primarily metabolized by the liver - specifically CYP450 2C8 and 3A4 - and to a lesser extent via glucuronidation. Metabolites of repaglinide are inactive and do not display glucose-lowering effects. Excretion: repaglinide is 90% excreted in the feces and 8% in the urine. 0.1% is cleared unchanged in the urine. Less than 2% is unchanged in the feces. History Precursor drugs to repaglinide were invented in late 1983 by scientists at Dr Karl Thomae GmbH, a German drug manufacturer located at Biberach an der Riß in southern Germany which was acquired by Boehringer Ingelheim in 1990. The drug that became repaglinide was later licensed by Boehringer to Novo Nordisk, which filed an Investigational New Drug application for the compound with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 1992. Novo Nordisk filed its New Drug Application (NDA) for Prandin in July 1997 and it was quickly approved, gaining FDA approval in December 1997. The drug was the first of the meglitinide class. It was branded Prandin because its quick onset and short duration of action concentrates its effect around meal time (the prandium was the Roman meal which is comparable to the modern lunch). Intellectual property After several attempts to file for U.S. patent protection, a filing was made in March 1990 which eventually became U.S. Patents 5,216,167 (June 1993), 5,312,924 (May 1994) and 6,143,769 (November 2000). After filing its NDA for repaglinide in 1997, Novo Nordisk applied for patent extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. This process, called patent term restoration, allows drug patents to be extended based on the time that a drug spent in clinical trials and in the approval process. Previously it had been decided by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the expiration date of U.S. Patents 5,216,167 and 5,312,924 would be 5 September 2006. In February 2001 Prandin's patent life was extended to 14 March 2009 in response to Novo Nordisk's patent term restoration application, with U.S. Patent 5,216,167 having been reissued as RE37035. Prior to the end of repaglinide's patent term, Novo Nordisk obtained a new patent, U.S. Patent 6,677,358 (January 2004), covering the combination therapy of repaglinide together with the generic anti-diabetic drug metformin. This new patent was due to expire June 2018. In January 2011, a federal court ruled Novo Nordisk's new patent invalid on the grounds of obviousness, and unenforceable on the grounds of inequitable conduct on the part of Novo Nordisk's patent attorneys.

Popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear; but waned within the decade. Specially designed trousers like low- rise jeans or hip-huggers and higher cut thongs led to greater exposure of the whale tail.Garchik, Leah (2004-08-23). \\"Daily Datebook\\". San Francisco Chronicle: F8. \\"A Hollister spy says the thong visible from the back of low- rise jeans is called a \\"whale tail.\\" The trend was also associated with the trend of sporting lower back tattoos. The word was selected by the American Dialect Society in January 2006 as the \\"most creative word\\" of 2005. History The rising popularity of low-rise jeans led to increased exposure of thong tops in the early 2000s. Britney Spears has been portrayed as a major contributor to the whale tail's popularity. Her whale tail display has been referred to in such creative literature books as Married to a Rock Star by Shemane Nugent, Thong on Fire by Noire, The Magical Breasts of Britney Spears by Ryan G. Van Cleave, and Off-Color by Janet McDonald. The Oregonian, a Portland, Oregon, newspaper, wrote in 2004 that an abundance of whale tails had become a distraction on the campus. Social commentator Ann C. Hall identified this campus trend as an \\"apparent intersection between everyday campus fashion and soft porn\\". The layered clothing trend of the early 2000s was partly led by the whale tail style that incorporates hip-hugger jeans, crop tops and high riding thongs popularized by celebrities. Rise Artists like Madonna (seen here at Seattle in 2012) Britney Spears made visible underwears and whale tails popular By the mid-2000s, whale tails became common to celebrities, providing opportunities to the paparazzi.Websites like the Whale tail World listed out their own version of top celebrity whale tails Whale tail display spawned a new accessory -- clip- on jewelry for the visible straps. Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian claimed that following pop stars in the hipster trousers gave rise to the \\"low-slung jeans, whale-tail G-string era\\". On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, \\"Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps riding high above their low-rise jeans.

Legal debates In 2004, Louisiana, USA State Representative Derrick Shepherd proposed a bill (HB1626), also known as the Baggy Pants Bill to Louisiana House of Representatives. The bill proposed that \\"it shall be unlawful for any person to appear in public wearing his pants below his waist and thereby exposing his skin or intimate clothing\\" and that violators would be subjected to three eight-hour days of community service and a fine of up to US$175. The measure died in the face of opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union. The bill was proposed again in 2008 and was rejected by a state Senate panel. In two Louisiana towns, Delcambre (a maximum penalty of US$615 fine or up to six months in prison) and Opelousas (a maximum penalty of US$500 fine or up to six months in prison), wearing low slung pants that reveal buttock cleavage or undergarments is considered a misdemeanor. Garments that reveal underpants were banned in four other Louisiana towns including Alexandria and Shreveport, where violators face fines of US$150 or 15 days in jail, as well as Hawkinsville, Georgia. In February 2005, the Senate Courts of Justice Committee of Virginia voted unanimously in a hastily convened meeting against a bill proposed by Delegate Algie T. Howell Jr. (Norfolk, Virginia) to impose a US$50 fine on any person who publicly and intentionally \\"wears and displays his below-waist undergarments, intended to cover a person's intimate parts, in a lewd or indecent manner\\" in a public place. The bill (HB1981), also known as the Droopy Drawers Bill, was earlier passed by Virginia House of Delegates by a 60-34 vote. Atlanta, Dallas, Baltimore, Charlotte, Yonkers, New York, Duncan, Oklahoma, Natchitoches, Louisiana, Stratford, Connecticut, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Trenton, New Jersey and Pleasantville, New Jersey, as well as three other Georgia towns, Rome, Brunswick and Plains have seen attempts to ban underwear peeking over the pants. School dress codes sometimes also banned some low-rising pants or visible underwear. Decline By the end of the decade whale tails suffered significant backlash. Jessica Kaminsky wrote in I Hate the Gym, a lifestyle commentary, \\"I hate when girls let their 'whale tails' creep out of their pants.\\" In 2007, religious writer Tamie Bixler Lung wrote, \\"There is something wrong when Christian guys and girls want to run around with their underwear hanging out the top of their pants, or their thong strap sticking out the back of their low-rise jeans.\\" The trend of wearing whale tail-revealing jeans started to dissipate somewhat in the mid 2000s when American clothing designers started shifting focus from low-slung jeans and exposed midriffs to high-waisted trousers and cardigans. Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion writer of The Guardian, claimed that the whale tail and the muffin top (the bulge of flesh hanging over the top of low-rider jeans), \\"twin crimes of modern fashion\\", had led to the decline in the popularity of hipster jeans. She quoted Louise Hunn, editor of the British edition of InStyle, as saying — \\"When a look goes too mainstream, people start wearing it badly. And then the really fashionable people run a mile\\". While the thong still represented 24% of the US$2.5 billion annual market in women's underwear, it stopped growing by end of 2004. Some vendors, including Victoria's Secret and DKNY, started selling thongs that do not result in whale tails. Adam Lippes, founder of the lingerie line ADAM, said, \\"Women got tired of it. And they got sick and tired of seeing string hanging out of the top of every celebrity's jeans.\\" Socio- cultural analysis Attributing whale tails to mainstreaming of the sexualization of young women, The Press Democrat termed the trend as \\"stripper chic\\". Post-modern thinker Yasmin Jiwani and co-writers described the trend in Girlhood: Redefining the Limits as an attempt to redefine girlhood while acknowledging the debate around it. The book termed the trend as the \\"slut\\" look popularized by Britney Spears. Some experts even dubbed visible whale tails as \\"thong feminism\\" for young girls. Other experts accused marketers of \\"outrageous selling of sex to children\\". One conjecture assumes that the style of exposed thong may have \\"bubbled-up\\" from the street level to the high streets, like the jeans and t-shirt look of James Dean. Another assumes the fad was initiated by glamor model Jordan in England and singers Mariah Carey and Spears in the United States. The phenomenon has been compared to the phenomenon of visible bra straps. Saying that \\"just as Madonna made bras a public garment in the 1980s, Ms. Lewinsky, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears transformed women's panties into a provocative garment intended for public display\\", the New York Times claimed that the thong, with straps worn high over the hips and exposed by fashionable low-rise jeans and \\"Juicy Couture\\" sweat pants, had become a public icon. Word of the year fluke, in whole or as one of the lobes. \\"Whale tail\\" was selected in January 2006 as the \\"most creative word\\" of 2005 by the American Dialect Society, a group of linguists, editors, and academics. It received 44 votes to muffin top 25, flee-ancée (a reference to runaway bride Jennifer Wilbanks) 15, and pinosaur (a very old Wollemi pine tree near Australia's Blue Mountains) 6. While discussing these new coinages, Sali Tagliamonte, associate professor of linguistics at the University of Toronto, observed that young women in North America were ahead of young men as influencers. The use of the word to indicate an underwear phenomenon has shown up in serious mainstream news media, sometimes in reference to the pop stars who made the fashion trend popular. Wayne Glowka, member of the Georgia College and State University faculty and head of the New Word Committee of the Dialect Society, said about the happening, \\"Language is just going on its merry way, creating many new words. It's time for men to win something.\\" Though the word is not included in major formal dictionaries, web- based user-generated dictionaries like Urban Dictionary, the Double-Tongued Dictionary and Wiktionary, have entries for the word. The book compilation of Urban Dictionary describes the whale tail as \\"the shape formed when a G-string rides up high over a woman's pants or skirt\\". The Dialect Society mentioned \\"longhorn\\" as an alternate term for the whale tail.

They bind to an ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells in a similar manner to sulfonylureas but have a weaker binding affinity and faster dissociation from the SUR1 binding site. This increases the concentration of intracellular potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive. This depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granula in the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro) insulin.  Drugs  Repaglinide Repaglinide (Prandin), gained FDA approval in 1997. Other drugs in this class include nateglinide (Starlix) and mitiglinide (Glufast).  Side effects  Side effects include weight gain and hypoglycemia. While the potential for hypoglycemia is less than for those on sulfonylureas, it is still a serious potential side effect that can be life-threatening.

Forced into exile by the communist authorities, he became a political refugee and resided in France as a stateless person. After 2000, Goma has expressed opinions on World War II, the Holocaust in Romania and the Jews, claims which have led to widespread allegations of antisemitism.  Biography = Early life  Goma was born to a Romanian family in Mana village, Orhei County, then in the Kingdom of Romania, now part of Moldova. In March 1944, the Goma family took refuge in Sibiu, Transylvania. In August 1944, finding themselves in danger of involuntary \\"repatriation\\" to the Soviet Union, they fled to the village of Buia, by the Târnava Mare River. From October to December 1944, the family hid in the forests around Buia. On January 13, 1945, they were captured by Romanian shepherds and turned over to the Gendarmerie in Sighişoara, where they were interned at the \\"Centrul de Repatriere\\" (\\"Repatriation Center\\"). There, Eufimie Goma forged documents for his family; however, Maria Goma's brother, who didn't have forged papers, was \\"repatriated to Siberia\\". In June 1945, taking advantage of the forged documents, they returned to Buia. Later on, Paul Goma would describe his family's refugee saga in the novels Arta refugii (\\"The Art of Refuge\\", a wordplay on the Romanian words for \\"refuge\\" and \\"taking flight\\"), Soldatul câinelui (\\"Dog's Soldier\\"), and Gardă inversă (\\"Reverse Guard\\"). Dissident in Romania In 1954, he was admitted to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bucharest.Deletant, p.236 In November 1956, he was part of the Bucharest student movement of 1956: during a seminar, he read out to other students parts of a novel he had written about a student who establishes a movement that is similar to the ones in Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Goma was arrested on the charge of attempting to organize a strike at the University of Bucharest and he was sentenced to two years in prison. He served his sentence at the prisons in Jilava and Gherla, and then was put under house arrest in Lăteşti (a former village of the Bordușani commune) until 1963. As a former political prisoner, he was not allowed to resume his studies and he had to work as a manual labourer until 1965 when a decree allowed former prisoners to study at the University. In September 1965, he was re-admitted as a first-year student at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bucharest. At the end of August 1968, Goma became a member of the Romanian Communist Party, in an act of solidarity with the Romanian position during the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia (Romania did not take part, indeed condemning the invasion). Several months later, Goma attempted to publish a novel, Ostinato (based on his experiences with the secret police), but it was not allowed by the censors after one of them claimed to recognize one character as Elena Ceaușescu. Nevertheless, he published the novel in translation in West Germany in 1971, as a result of which, Paul Goma was excluded from the Communist Party. During the summer of 1972, he was allowed to visit France, where he wrote Gherla, a novel based on his experiences in the Gherla Prison. This book was also denied publication in Romania but was published in France in 1976. Goma's 1977 letters In 1977, Goma wrote a public letter expressing solidarity with the Charter 77, but, finding few friends willing to sign it, he wrote another letter, addressed directly to Ceaușescu, in which he asked him to sign it, as the two of them (Goma and Ceaușescu) were the only Romanians not afraid of the Securitate. Following this, he wrote another letter (addressed to the 35 countries in the CSCE) in which he called for respect for human rights in Romania.Deletant, p.239 In February 1977, Ceaușescu made a speech in which he attacked the \\"traitors of the country\\", referring to the two letters Goma wrote. The following day, a police cordon was in front of his building, not allowing non-residents, to prevent people from signing Goma's letter. The authorities tried to convince Goma to emigrate, but he refused. As the police cordon got more relaxed, several more people signed the letter and they were arrested on exiting Goma's apartment. In March, he wrote an even tougher admonitory letter to Ceaușescu, urging him not to break the bond between the people and him, a bond that was created after Ceaușescu condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and attacked the Securitate whom Goma said were \\"traitors and enemies of Romania, who produce nothing and prevent those who produce from producing more\\".Deletant, p.240 In the meantime, Goma gained the support of two intellectuals: psychiatrist Ion Vianu and literary critic Ion Negoiţescu; in all, he had 75 signatures. Called by Cornel Burtică, the Secretary for Propaganda of the Central Committee, on March 12, Goma got the promise of being allowed to publish again, but he refused as he said that he wants not to be followed by the Securitate.Deletant, p.241 A week later, a former boxer, Horst Stumpf, broke into Goma's flat and attacked him; the attacks repeated the following days. As he was barricading himself with some friends in his apartment, he gave an interview to French TV station Antenne 2. Goma was arrested and excluded from the Writers' Union of Romania. Following his arrest, he was attacked in the Romanian media: in a Săptămîna article, Eugen Barbu called him \\"a nullity\\", in Luceafărul, Nicolae Dragoş said he was \\"rousing reactionary elements\\" and in Contemporanul, Vasile Băran, not mentioning Goma, claimed that \\"individuals calling themselves writers and journalists sully with the dirtiest of dirt our noble profession\\". An international appeal for his release was launched, among the signatories being Eugène Ionesco, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Miller and Edward Albee. Goma was released on 6 May 1977, four days before the anniversary of 100 years of Romanian independence, celebrations which Ceaușescu didn't want overshadowing by Goma's arrest. On November 20, 1977, Goma and his family left Romania and went into exile in France.Paul Goma, in Culoarea curcubeului '77. Cod 'Bǎrbosul', Polirom, 2005. Paul Goma, in Le Tremblement des Hommes: peut-on vivre en Roumanie aujourd'hui?, Éditions du Seuil, Paris, 1979. . Exile in France On 3 February 1981, Goma and Nicolae Penescu (former Interior Minister) received parcels in their post. Penescu opened his parcel to find a book and when he lifted its cover an explosion wounded him. Goma, who had received two death threats since his arrival in France, called the police. Both packages had been sent on instructions by Carlos the Jackal.John Follain, Jackal: The Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal, Arcade Publishing, 1998. . . In 1982, the Securitate planned to assassinate Goma. Matei Haiducu, the secret agent sent by the Securitate to carry out the plan, turned to French counter-intelligence (DST). With the help of the DST, Haiducu simulated an attempt on Goma's life, by poisoning his drink at a restaurant; the drink was then spilled by a French agent, pretending to be a \\"clumsy guest\\".\\"Rumanian Sting\\", in Time, September 13, 1982 Although Goma's numerous works (both fiction and non-fiction) were translated worldwide, his books, except the first one, were published in Romania only after the 1989 Revolution. He lived in Paris as a stateless political refugee, his Romanian citizenship having been revoked after 1978 by the communist government. Death On March 18, 2020, Paul Goma was hospitalized at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris after being infected with COVID-19 and died on March 25, 2020. He was 84.  Controversies  Some of Goma's post-2005 articles and essays have been criticized for their strong antisemitic nature.Gabriel Andreescu, in \\"Goma şi tema antisemitismului\\" , Ziua, February 17, 2005 In particular, in his \\"essay\\" Săptămâna Roșie [The Red Week], he tried to rewrite the Romanian history of the years 1940–1944, claiming that the Jews exaggerated the numbers of the victims of the Romanian holocaust, that communist Jews made things up and that Jews were not the victims, but the perpetrators of several of the heinous crimes of those times, using thus strategies common to holocaust denial.Paul Goma: Săptămâna roșie 28 iunie- 3 iulie 1940 sau Basarabia și evreii. Eseu. Chișinău: Museum 2003 (in Romanian) Goma rejects these criticismsPaul Goma, in \\"A fi \\"Antisemit\\", November 11, 2005 and claims that he has filed libel lawsuits against his accusers.Dan Culcer, in \\"Pledoarie pentru Goma\\", March 3, 2007 He asserted that his wife was Jewish and stated that similar arguments were used against him by the Securitate in the 1980s.Paul Goma, in \\"Jurnal 2006\\", 2006, pages 48, 191, 201. On January 30, 2007, Goma was awarded the \\"Citizen of Honor\\" distinction by the Municipal Council of Timișoara. In February 2007, the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania and the Israeli Embassy protested against the distinction, arguing that Paul Goma was the author of multiple antisemitic articles.Paul Goma, in , \\"Scrisoare către prietenii din Timișoara — şi din toată ţara\\", February 22, 2007 On April 5, 2006 he was invited to become a member of the Tismăneanu Commission,Paul Goma, in , \\"Despre Vladimir Tismăneanu – şi nu numai – în 11 puncte\\", June 22, 2006 a body charged with researching the crimes of the communist dictatorship in Romania. Nine days later he was dismissed by the Commission's president, Vladimir Tismăneanu, who explained the exclusion based on Goma's questioning the moral and scientific credibility of the president of the Commission, and disclosing of their private correspondence.Tismăneanu, in Armand Gosu, \\"N-am avut de-a face cu Securitatea\\", in 22, nr.849, June 2006 Literary contributions Goma's literary debut came in 1966 with a short story published in the review Luceafǎrul with which he collaborated as well as with Gazeta literarǎ, Viaţa românească and Ateneu. In 1968 he published his first volume of stories, Camera de alături (\\"The Room Next Door\\"). After Ostinato and its West German publication in 1971 came Uşa (\\"Die Tür\\" or \\"The Door\\") in 1972, also in Germany. After his forced emigration in 1977 and until his books could again be published in Romania after the 1989 revolution, all his books appeared in France and in French. (His novel Gherla had in fact been published in 1976 first in French by Gallimard of Paris before he left Romania.) There followed such novels as Dans le cercle (\\"Within the Circle\\", 1977); Garde inverse (\\"Reverse Guard\\", 1979); Le Tremblement des Hommes (\\"The Trembling of People\\", 1979); Chassée-croisé (\\"Intersection\\", 1983); Les Chiens de la mort (\\"The Dogs of Death\\", 1981), which details his prison experiences in Piteşti in the 1950s; and Bonifacia (1986). The autobiographical Le Calidor appeared in French in 1987 and was subsequently published in Romanian as Din Calidor: O copilărie basarabeană (\\"In Calidor: A Bessarabian Childhood\\", 1989, 1990; translated as My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest) in the Romanian émigré journal Dialog, edited by Ion Solacolu.Segel, Harold B. The Columbia Guide to the Literatures of Eastern Europe Since 1945, p. 189-90. Columbia University Press, 2003, . In its totality, Goma's literary work comprises a \\"persuasive and grimly fascinating exposure of totalitarian inhumanity\\"Segel, p. 190. from which, in his own case, even foreign exile was no guarantee of a safe haven. In such later novels as Bonifacia and My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest, the biographical element dominates as he focuses on his childhood and adolescence in Bessarabia. Several sets of diaries, all published in Romania in 1997 and 1998, shed light on Goma's later life and career: Alte Jurnale (\\"Other Journals\\"), which covers his stay in the United States in autumn 1978 but concentrates primarily on 1994–96; Jurnal I: Jurnal pe sărite (\\"Journal I: By Leaps and Bounds\\", 1997); Jurnal II: Jurnal de căldură mare (\\"Journal II: Journal of Great Heat\\", 1997), covering June and July 1989; Jurnal III: Jurnal de noapte lungă (\\"Journal of the Long Night\\", 1997), covering September to December 1993; and Jurnalul unui jurnal 1997 (\\"The Journal of a Journal, 1997\\"), focusing just on that year.

He was the Director of Rugby at Widnes Vikings of the Super League after being the club's head coach prior to promotion from the Championship. Cullen previously coached the Warrington Wolves as well as England. He also provides commentary for Sky Sports rugby league coverage. Playing career Paul Cullen joined Warrington in 1980 from local Amateur side Crosfields ARLFC , where he stayed for 17 years. He played mainly in the position at the club. Nicknamed \\"psycho\\", despite limited attacking flair, Cullen had an aggressive defence which made him a crowd favourite. County Cup Final appearances Paul Cullen played in Warrington's 16–0 victory over St. Helens in the 1982 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1982–83 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 23 October 1982, and played right-, i.e. number 3, in the 8–34 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1985–86 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 13 October 1985. John Player Special/Regal Trophy Final appearances Paul Cullen played right-, i.e. number 3, in Warrington's 4–18 defeat by Wigan in the 1986–87 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1986–87 season at Burnden Park, Bolton on Saturday 10 January 1987, played in the 12–2 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1990–91 Regal Trophy Final during the 1990–91 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 12 January 1991, and played left-, i.e. number 11, in the 10–40 defeat by Wigan in the 1994–95 Regal Trophy Final during the 1994–95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 28 January 1995. Coaching career After ending his playing career in 1996, Cullen moved into coaching. He had spells on the coaching staff at Warrington. He worked in both the under-21s and as assistant coach. In 2000 he moved to Cumbrian side Whitehaven He accepted his first Super League head coaching role at Warrington in August 2002, replacing David Plange. Cullen successfully steered Warrington away from relegation, by winning 2 games against Halifax and Castleford ending the season with a thumping 50–10 loss at Wakefield., and towards play-off football. It was this success which bought Cullen an extended rein at the helm due to the loyalty of the fans despite falling short of expectations with the playing roster he had. In 2006 he was appointed the Head Coach of England 'A' ahead of the Federation Shield tournament in the autumn. On 26 May 2008, following a run of poor form that culminated in a 36–28 to struggling Castleford, Cullen resigned from his position as Head Coach amid heavy pressure from fans and pundits. He was the longest-serving coach in the league at the time of his departure, having spent six years in charge of the Wires and guided them to a Challenge Cup semi-final and a play-off victory. His replacement at Warrington was James Lowes, who was later replaced by Tony Smith. Widnes unveiled Paul Cullen as Head Coach on a two-year deal on 9 March 2009. Speaking on his appointment he said \\"I'm really excited to be joining Widnes. The plan is simple, we need to get Widnes into Super League where we belong\\". In November 2010, he moved upstairs at the club to become Director of Rugby while Denis Betts took over his position as head coach.

On December 12, when the Greek offensive commanded by Konstantinos Sapountzakis was launched, he planned to retreat in an orderly fashion, but panic amongst the ranks led to the defeat of his division. In the defense line of Bizani he was severely wounded in the thigh, but continued to direct artillery fire whilst on a stretcher.Ayfer Özçelik, Ali Fuad Cepesoy, p. 7. On March 6, 1913, he and his forces surrendered following the instruction of Esad Pasha (Battle of Bizani).

After the Seventh Army was abolished, he transferred the headquarters of the XX Corps from Syria to Ereğli, then to Konya and to Ankara. War of Independence Ali Fuat Pasha organized the resistance in Western Turkey against the Greek invasion and thus actually started the National Independence War. He contributed to the resistance forces against the Greek army that had begun to occupy Western Anatolia. He signed Amasya Protocol and at the end of the Sivas Congress in 1920, he was appointed as the general commander of the National Forces by the Board of Representatives. The presence of him and his army in Ankara is the reason behind Atatürk's choice of this city as the center of Turkish War of Independence. The same year, he was elected as a deputy at the First Parliament. He was appointed ambassador to Moscow, Soviet Russia in 1921, as he had quarrels with İsmet İnönü, who was appointed by Atatürk as the Commander of the Western Front although İnönü had failed against Greek invasion at Kutahya-Altıntas in 1921. By personally negotiating with Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin in Moscow, he signed the Treaty of Moscow (1921), along the lines of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, as the representative of the Ankara government, which provided financial and military support from Russia to the Turkish Independence War, in exchange for ceding the right to Batum, then controlled by the Georgian Republic, to the Soviet government. After finishing his duty as an ambassador, he was elected as the second spokesman of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Political life Ali Fuat Cebesoy in the 1940s After the declaration of the Republic, he became a deputy. In this new era of his political career, he joined the founders of the opposition party, the Progressive Republican Party, and he was elected as the general secretary of the party in 1924. During the rebellion of Şeyh Sait, the Law on the Maintenance of Order was affected and the Progressive Republican Party was closed down. Ali Fuat Cebesoy was arrested with the accusations of participating in the attempt of assassination against Atatürk and was taken to İzmir. He was tried at the İzmir Independence Court and was acquitted in 1926. He retired with the title of general. He stayed away from politics for four years between 1927 and 1931. In 1931, he returned to politics and was elected as a deputy representing Konya. He served as the deputy for Konya and Eskişehir until 1950. He also served as Minister of Public Works from 1939 to 1943, Minister of Transportation (1943–1946) and as the president of the Parliament in 1948. He was an independent candidate of the Democratic Party from Eskişehir in the first democratic elections of the Turkish history held on May 14, 1950, and he was elected with a landslide. In the following years, he was elected as a deputy from İstanbul and served in the parliament for ten more years between 1950 and 1960. After the military coup on May 27, 1960, he was initially arrested by the junta with the rest of the Democratic Party MPs but later set free. After this experience he quit politics for good. In accordance with his will, he was buried to the backyard of a mosque near Geyve train station, where the first shots of the Turkish War of Independence were fired, when he died at the age of 86. However, his remains were moved to the Turkish State Cemetery in Ankara, after the military coup of 1980.

Drivers who consider themselves beginners may continue to display the sign, even after the period of a year. Like the orange and yellow \\"fukushi mark\\" or \\"koreisha mark\\" that denotes elderly drivers, the shoshinsha mark is designed to warn other drivers that the marked driver is not very skilled, either due to inexperience or old age. In Japan the shoshinsha mark is also used beyond the driving context to indicate beginner status. In Tochigi, for example, new mothers are issued a card with the mark on it to indicate their experience level to health and child care support staff. New employees of companies may also have the mark on their name badges until they become more experienced. In video games, it is associated with tutorials and new players. In the anime Sgt.

John II of Luxembourg was appointed governor of Arras in 1414, and conducted several raids into nearby Armagnac outposts. In April 1418, at the command of a Burgundian force, he relieved the besieged city of Senlis from the Armagnacs. After Paris was seized by the Burgundians in May of the same year, John II became governor of Paris, serving from 1418 to 1420. He took the side of the English during the Hundred Years' War, and carried out a number of chevauchées on behalf of the Regent Bedford. John II and his family were steadfast supporters of the English cause among the French nobility, and his brother Louis (1391–1443), the bishop of Thérouanne, became chancellor of France for the Duke of Bedford. In 1425, he seized the seigneurie of Guise, which he had disputed with René of Anjou. Guise, at that time the last Armagnac outpost in northern France, was of strategic importance grew due to its position between Burgundy and the Burgundian Netherlands. John II was a descendant of the Châtillon counts of Saint-Pol, who formerly held Guise, and his claim to it was recognized by the Duke of Bedford. Joined by an English force under sir Thomas Rempston, John II put the city under siege, and Guise, along with the fortress of Hirson, formally surrendered to him on 1 March 1425. Coat of Arms of John II of Luxembourg He joined Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, in the Siege of Compiègne in 1430. While the siege was ultimately unsuccessful, a soldier in his company (the Bastard of Vendôme) captured Joan of Arc, whom he sent to Beauvoir as a prisoner. Shortly thereafter, his aunt Jeanne of Luxembourg, who was then living with him, died and left him the County of Ligny. Under pressure from England and Burgundy, John ultimately sold Joan to the English for 10,000 livres, thus causing her death. The Count of Ligny continued campaigning in France for the next few years. He made a few incursions in the region around Laon, and from 1433, he campaigned in Picardy, capturing Haplincourt in that year and Saint-Valery in 1434. During the congress of Arras in 1435, Ligny was one those who urged Philip of Burgundy not to sign a peace treaty with the Armagnacs. Philip did so anyway and concluded the Treaty of Arras with Charles VII of France, which Ligny peremptorily refused to sign. This irritated Charles, who authorised his men to attack his lands. Ligny from then on was forced to deal with écorcheurs ravaging his lands. In 1436, La Hire pillaged Soissons, which belonged to Ligny's daughter-in-law, Jeanne of Bar. In early 1436, Ligny was asked by Duke Philip III to help reach a peace agreement with the English, through John's older brother Louis of Luxembourg. The English however were furious at Philip's betrayal and war broke out between the former allies. In late 1437, the Duke of Burgundy asked the Count of Ligny for help in raising levies for the Burgundian siege of English-held Le Crotoy. John refused, asserting that he never broke faith with his English allies and would not do so at that moment. Ligny died on 5 January 1441 at Guise, having never taken the oath to the treaty of Arras. At his death, he left his lands to his nephew Louis. His fiefs were instead confiscated by Charles VII, though they were later restored.

Biography He was most likely born in Gascony; he became the secretary of Henri II de Bourbon, prince de Condé (until c.1606), and then passed into the service of king Henry IV of France as \\"secrétaire de la chambre du roi\\". Nervèze had close ties to fellow writers Philippe Desportes, Jean Bertaut and Scévole de Saint-Marthe; he was called the king of orators (\\"le roy des orateurs\\") by François Maynard and, in a satirical poem, was called (with Nicolas des Escuteaux) the \\"mignon des dames\\". Nervèze was one of the most prolific writers of his generation and became for many an arbiter of linguistic style and taste. Nervèze is representative of a younger generation following on the literary developments of French novelists Nicolas de Montreux and Béroalde de Verville, and he is often associated - along with authors Nicolas des Escuteaux and François du Souhait - with the sentimental novels (or \\"amours\\") published during the reign of Henry IV. Nervèze wrote ten novels, of which one is a reworking of a story taken from Ariosto's Orlando furioso and one is a reworking of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered. Nervèze dedicated his novels to high-ranking members of the nobility around the king: Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully; Queen Marie de Médicis; the marquis de Rosny; the vicomte d'Aubeterre. Nervèze's first novels were published in 1598, but they were most likely written earlier and had perhaps circulated in manuscript form for years. His first \\"amours\\" are short works of tragic love that are close to the tragic tales of Italian Matteo Bandello; his later \\"Léandre\\" novels show the influence of chivalric adventure novels (like Amadis of Gaul). Most of Nervèze's novels proclaim their veracity and take place in the recent past during the civil wars in France, although the story of Palmelie and Lirisis takes place under François II of France and Charles IX of France, and the story of Lidior occurs around 1600 during the conflict between the Dutch provinces and the Spanish Netherlands. His collected novels were published several times in anthologized form, and the number of editions seems to indicate commercial success. Along with his novels, Nervèze wrote numerous works of moral philosophy, and his moral and religious philosophy is evident in most of his works, including the novels. His Catholicism is mixed with elements of stoicism and he idealized the chastity and purity of his characters (who frequently seek out retreat in convents to assuage their woes) and his novel Les amours de Polydore et de Virgin[i]e celebrates divine love as a cure for the ravages of earthly love. In the first decades of the 17th century, Nervèze, Des Escuteaux and their colleagues were seen by their detractors (such as Charles Sorel) as ridiculous purveyors of rhetorical and metaphorical excess, but their works represent an important stage in the development of the novel in France (leading to L'Astrée by Honoré d'Urfé and, later, to Madeleine de Scudéry and Madame de Lafayette), in the development of etiquette and a moralized sense of nobility (the conception of the \\"honnête homme\\") and in the evolution of the French language (prefiguring the \\"Précieuses\\").

Originally from Spain, this game evolves from Kiriki into a more social game. The object of the game is to force either the person preceding you or the person following you to drink. Play The players sit in a circle and the game proceeds clockwise. The first player throws the dice, with the cup or basket covering the dice so only he can see the score. He then tells the other players the score he wants them to think he has. The next person then decides whether they believe the first player or not. If they do, they are forced to call a higher score than the one they have accepted, upon rolling the dice. In other words, if the first player said 9, the subsequent player would be forced to say 9 or higher (calling a number equal to the prior player's guess is permissible), and so on. If a player does not believe the preceding player, the cup is lifted to show everyone the score. If the first player's score was what he claimed or higher, the person who lifted the cup drinks; if it was lower, the person who threw the dice drinks. After someone drinks, the score is reset. Combinations that are not doubles can score 4 to 11 points. Doubles are always higher than other combinations, with the exception of the Kinito, which is the combination of a 1 and a 2. Sometimes, the combination of 5 and 6 is also considered a Kinito. If a player rolls a Kinito, they reveal the dice themselves. A player who scores a Kinito can institute a rule (as in Twenty One, cancel an existing rule, or select another player by placing the basket on the head of the chosen player. That player then has three chances to roll a Kinito. If they fail, they drink. If they succeed, they select another player who repeats the process. This continues until someone fails to get a Kinito; that player then must drink the same number of drinks as there have been Kinitos.

(8 July 1868 – 17 June 1943) was an Irish scholar and priest, based in London, active in evangelisation and apologetics.  Early life  McNabb was born in Portaferry, County Down, Ireland, the tenth of eleven children. He was educated during his schooldays at the diocesan seminary of St. Malachy's College, Belfast. On 10 November 1885 he joined the novitiate of the English Dominicans at Woodchester in Gloucestershire, England and was ordained in 1891. After studies at the University of Louvain, where he obtained in 1894 the degree of Licentiate of Sacred Theology, he was sent to England where he served for the remainder of his life.  Career  Fr. McNabb was a member of the Dominican order for 58 years and served as professor of philosophy at Hawkesyard Priory, prior at Woodchester, parish priest at St. Dominic's Priory, and prior and librarian at Holy Cross Priory, Leicester, as well as in various other official capacities for his Dominican province. In 1913 he visited the United States, to preach and lecture in New York. McNabb was a frequent contributor to Blackfriars, the Dominican literary monthly published in Oxford. In 1919 Albert I of Belgium awarded McNabb with a medal of the Order of the Crown for his efforts on behalf of Belgium war relief. Between 1929 and 1934, he lectured on the Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas under the auspices of the University of London External Lectures scheme. Tens of thousands of people heard him preach in Hyde Park for the Catholic Evidence Guild, where he did not shy away from taking on all challengers—Protestants, atheists, and freethinkers—before vast crowds every Sunday, or heard him debate such luminaries as George Bernard Shaw in the city's theaters and conference halls on the burning social issues of the day. Fr. McNabb was described as a 13th-century monk living in 20th-century London, pursuing such tasks as reading the Old Testament (and taking notes on it) in Hebrew, reading the New Testament (and quoting from it) in Greek, and reading the works of St. Thomas Aquinas (and writing his reflections on them) in Latin. Throughout his life, Fr. McNabb had little to call his own, except his Bible, his breviary, and his copy of the Summa Theologica. Fr. Vincent McNabb's grave Fr. McNabb was among the early Catholic ecumenists, seeking in particular to promote reunion between the Catholic Church and the Anglicans. Towards the end of his life, he wrote, \\"God knows how much I have striven and prayed to mend the shattered unity of Christendom.\\" As a young priest, he came under the influence of the convert bishop of Clifton, William Robert Brownlow, who, after his reception into the Catholic Church by Newman, not only kept many Anglican friendships but made others among Nonconformists. Brownlow was the author of a work breathing a strong ecumenical spirit titled Catholics and Nonconformists: or Dialogues on Conversion (1898). McNabb regarded him as one of his \\"masters and heroes\\" and wrote his biography. While prior at Woodchester, McNabb was in correspondence with Anglicans on both sides of the Atlantic. He was host to his Cotswolds neighbour, the Rev. Spencer Jones, rector of Moreton-in-Marsh, leading Anglo-Catholic and author of England and the Holy See: An Essay Towards Reunion (1902). He also contributed to the early issues of The Lamp, a paper edited by Fr. Paul Wattson, who, after becoming a Catholic, was to promote the Unity Octave through it for almost half a century. McNabb's lifelong interest in ecumenism culminated in his book The Church and Reunion (1937), published six years before his death. McNabb sought also to promote a vision of social justice inspired by St. Thomas and by Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum, which called upon \\"every minister of holy religion... to bring to the struggle [for broad distribution of property] the full energy of his mind and all his powers of endurance\\", as well as to shore up both faith and reason against the threat of modernism.  Death  He died at St. Dominic's Parish, London and was buried in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London.  Quotes about Fr. McNabb  Works  *Bishop Brownlow (1830–1901).

This data catalogues the history of personnel in the military and their family for purposes of healthcare, retirement funding and other administrative needs. It has offices in Seaside, California and Alexandria, Virginia.  History  DMDC was established in 1974 as the Manpower Research and Data Analysis Center (MARDAC) and made a DoD tenant activity within the U.S. Navy. In 1976, it was made a Field Activity of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower & Reserve Affairs (OASD (M&RA;)) and renamed the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). One year later, DMDC was transferred to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for administrative support and in 1991 was designated a Defense Support Activity supported by DLA. While the name and the supporting activity have varied over the years, DMDC's primary function has always been to support the information management needs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness (OUSD (P&R;)) and its predecessors. DMDC was established at a time of great turbulence in the Department of Defense. The Vietnam War had just ended, active military forces and military personnel strengths were being reduced significantly, the Total Force Policy was being initiated, and the All-Volunteer Force era had just begun. To manage through this period, OASD (M&RA;) established DMDC to collect and maintain accurate, readily available manpower and personnel data. In October 2016, the Department of Defense launched an anonymous survey conducted by the DMDC to collect testimonies of sexual assault among the US military personnel. In January 2017, the Department of Defense allowed 16 million discharged veterans to shop online for discounted military exchange products (effective November 2017). The DMDC was put in charge of creating an application to verify veteran's identities online with the database of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. In November 2017, different government entities, including the DMDC, gave different numbers regarding the troops in Syria (from 503 to more than 2,000). As a result, in its April 2018 quarterly report, the Pentagon removed the troops numbers in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. The DMDC was supposedly «updating their policy for these reports» and committed to provide these numbers retroactively. The next month, the Pentagon declared there were more than 44,000 US troops around the globe that the DMDC could not track precisely. Following up on this issue, the United States Census Bureau declared that the accuracy of the 2020 census was at risk because deployed troops will be counted as residents of the stateside military installations where they're usually stationed (which will give a serious boost of residents in North Carolina, Kentucky, and other states with major military infrastructure). However, since the November 2017 data glitch, the DMDC cannot release anymore data on temporarily deployed service members, making it impossible for the US Census Bureau to apply this new statistics policy.  Description  The mission of DMDC can be summarized as follows: *Collect and maintain an archive of automated manpower, personnel, training, and other databases for the Department of Defense, *Support the information requirements of the OUSD (P&R;) and other members of the DoD manpower, personnel, and training communities with accurate, timely, and consistent data, *Operate DoD- wide personnel programs and conduct research and analysis as directed by the OUSD (P&R;).

Metrorail is an operator of commuter rail services in the major urban areas of South Africa. It is a division of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA), a state-owned enterprise which is responsible for most passenger rail services in South Africa. The Metrorail system consists of 471 stations, of track, and carries an average of 1.7 million passengers per weekday. Metrorail was formed as a business unit of Transnet and was transferred to the South African Rail Commuter Corporation (SARCC), the predecessor of PRASA. In the early 1990s Metrorail was placed under Spoornet, another business unit of Transnet but on 1 January 1997, Metrorail became an independent business within Transnet and the Metrorail regions were formed. In 2006 Metrorail was transferred back into the SARCC; in 2008 the SARCC became PRASA. Regions Because Metrorail operates services in several separate cities, for operational purposes it is subdivided into four regions. Map of Metrorail Gauteng Region ;Gauteng region Previously there were two regions: Witwatersrand in the south and Tshwane in the north. The southern area covers the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area (also known as the Witwatersrand). Trains run from Johannesburg and Germiston outwards to Springs, Pretoria, Soweto and Randfontein via Krugersdorp.Metrorail Regional Routes—Witwatersrand The northern part covers Pretoria and surrounding suburbs. Trains run from Pretoria station outwards to the various suburbs of the city, as well as southwards to Johannesburg via Kempton Park and Germiston stations (in the Witwatersrand region).Metrorail Regional Routes—Tshwane Map of Metrorail Durban Region ;Durban region This region covers Durban and the surrounding suburbs and towns. Trains run from Durban station outwards as far as Stanger on the north coast, Kelso on the south coast, and Cato Ridge inland.Metrorail Regional Routes—Durban Map of Metrorail Eastern Cape ;Eastern Cape region This region operates two separate lines in the Eastern Cape: one running from East London to Berlin, and one from Port Elizabeth to Uitenhage. Plans are in the pipeline to connect the service to Coega.Metrorail Regional Routes—Eastern Cape Map of Metrorail Western Cape ;Western Cape region This region covers the Cape Town metropolitan area and surrounding towns. Trains run from Cape Town railway station southwards to Simon's Town, southeastwards to Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, and eastwards through Bellville to Strand, Stellenbosch and Wellington; occasional services run to Malmesbury and Worcester.Metrorail Regional Routes—Western Cape and Route Map Track and equipment Metrorail trains, as with the rest of the South African rail network, run on track. Some routes run on track owned and operated by PRASA; other routes run on track operated by Transnet and also used for long-distance and freight trains. Most Metrorail services are operated by electric multiple unit train sets of the type 5M2A. Since 1999, these trains are being refurbished. Everything above the underframe is completely removed, and replaced by new, prefabricated wall and roof modules. In 2007 alone more than 300 coaches were refurbished.SARCC Annual Report 2006/07 The new trains are designated 10M3 (Cape Town), 10M4 (Gauteng) or 10M5 (Durban). The Metrorail services on the Eastern Cape are operated by four diesel trains, each consisting of ten coaches and a diesel locomotive.Eastern Cape Metrorail 2010 Operational Plan April 2008 280 train sets operate on the system, each able to carry up to 1,800 passengers.Metrorail Homepage In October 2013, Gibela was awarded a contract to build 600 X'Trapolis Mega EMU trainsets (3,600 cars), the first half of a multi-phase rolling stock renewal program that would see up to 1,200 new trainsets delivered by the 2030s. Safety concerns In recent years, much concern has been raised about the safety of passengers on Metrorail trains, both due to crime and accidents.IOL: Class action suit launched against MetrorailIOL: 'Train safety, efficiency vital for 2010' Serious incidents include murders and assaults on-board trains; several level crossing accidents,IOL: Train derailed after collision with trailerIOL: News for South Africa and the World and a crash in Soweto.IOL: Scores injured as trains crash in Soweto An organisation called the Rail Commuters Action Group instituted a lawsuit against Metrorail and the government to force them to invest more money in security.IOL: Commuters take rail terror battle to court The case reached the Constitutional Court, which declared that Metrorail has \\"an obligation to ensure that reasonable measures are taken to provide for the security of rail commuters\\".

His signature dish is black cod in miso. He has restaurants bearing his name in several countries. He has also played small parts in three major films. Biography Nobu was born in Saitama, Japan. When he was seven years old, his father died in a traffic crash, and he and his two older brothers were raised by his mother. Immediately following the death of his father, Nobu began to travel the world. Over the next decade, while being raised by his mother, Chef Nobu experienced many cultures and witnessed first hand the reaches of poverty and hunger. His experience influenced his efforts later in life to give back to communities through his business ventures. After graduating from high school, he worked at the restaurant Matsue Sushi in Shinjuku, Tokyo, for seven years and was invited by a regular customer, who was a Peruvian of Japanese descent, to open a Japanese restaurant in Peru. In 1973 at age 24, he moved to Lima, Peru and opened a restaurant with the same name of Matsue in partnership with his sponsor. Nobu was unable to find many of the ingredients he took for granted in Japan and had to improvise, and it was here that he developed his unique style of cuisine that incorporated Peruvian ingredients into Japanese dishes. He later moved to Alaska, and opened his own restaurant, but about two weeks after the grand opening there was an electrical fire and the restaurant burned down.Nobu's Matsuhisa Turns 30: An Oral History of the Sushi Restaurant Where Tom Cruise Couldn't Get In Michael O'Connell, The Hollywood Reporter, June 2, 2017 In 1977, he moved to Los Angeles and worked at Japanese restaurants \\"Mitsuwa\\" and \\"Oshou.\\" In 1987, he opened his own restaurant \\"Matsuhisa\\" on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. Acting Nobu has had small roles in three major films: in Casino (1995) alongside his business partner Robert De Niro, in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and in Memoirs of a Geisha (2005). Hotels there are twelve Nobu hotels in several countries, with six more planned. Criticism Nobu restaurants sell Atlantic bluefin tuna, an endangered species. As a result, from press and campaigning pressure, they offered to add a warning on their menu, but this was considered inadequate by conservationists to help the spiral of demand and market price that leads to overfishing.

A variety of Dutch, Spanish and Asian coins were in official and common usage. After the collapse of the VOC at the end of the 18th century, control of the islands reverted to the Dutch government, which issued silver 'Netherlands Indies' gulden and fractional silver and copper coins until Indonesian independence in 1945. History=Prior to European contact A number of forms of payment were found throughout the archipelago prior to European contact. Stamped gold and silver masa and kupang date from the 9th century, with later coins substantially debased, with 13th-century silver masa containing only copper, while gold coins were very light. It is possible that this reflected a move towards the use of lower value coins for every day transactions. The rise of the Majapahit empire from the 13th century saw the masa disappear from use, replaced with the 'picis', or copper Chinese cash in the 14th century, which had been produced in vast numbers in China, and were kept in strings of 100 or 1000 coins. 14th century documentation shows the cash coins in widespread use, which spread to nearby islands including Sumatra (although not the Islamic Aceh, which minted its own Arabic gold mas coins). Trade with China was banned by China for substantial portions of the next two centuries, and so lighter copies were made by local Chinese merchants (out of locally available lead or tin rather than the more desirable copper, which needed to come from China). In the Islamic Sultanate of Palembang, these coins eventually (from the 17th century) became the 'pitis', a holed coin with Arabic writing. 16th Century European trade with the Indies began in the 16th century, with the Spanish eight real coin, or Spanish Dollar, the predominant world trade coin, used in Portuguese expeditions to the East to bring valuable spices back to Europe. Chinese and other Asian traders were also using silver coins including the Indian Rupee and Eight Real. The low-valued picis had wildly fluctuating value, but were worth around 10,000 lead picis to the piece of eight around the turn of the 17th century. Due to lack of supply of the genuine Chinese copper picis, they were worth six times as much as the lead coin by this time. 17th Century—United East India Company take control Trade companies in two provinces of the Netherlands began trading expeditions to the Indies in the late 16th century, and were authorised to issue their own trade coins for use on these expeditions: the United Amsterdam Company in 1601 and the Middelburg Company in 1602. Each issued 8 Real coins, while the United Amsterdam Company also issued 4, 2, 1, and Real coins. The 1601 coin was the first trade dollar issued by any European power in the East, but the unfamiliar coins were rejected in favour of the well-known 8 Real coins produced by Spain and its possessions, which were accepted all over the world. The Spanish coins remained the preferred large silver (trade) coin in the Indies until the 19th century. In 1602, the United East India Company (VOC) was formed from six trading companies in the Netherlands, and granted a trade monopoly over the Indies. In 1619 the company established its capital at Jacatra, which it called Batavia. It gradually spread its influence over Java, and established control over Sumatra in 1667 by treaty. The company's directors, sitting in Amsterdam, adopted a unit of account system, based on a notional guilder, divided into 20 notional stuivers. This followed Dutch practice, and reflected the tendency for coins to get debased over time, and hence the nominal value of a given weight of silver to increase. The rijksdaalder, with 25.7 g actual silver weight, was declared the Dutch national coin in 1606, and valued at 47 stuivers, a rate increased to 48 stuivers in 1608. The stuiver and two stuiver coins had a slightly lower silver weight than implied by this conversion rate, reflecting their utility as small change. The weight of silver equal to one guilder unit was derived from the value in stuivers of the weight of the rijksdaalder coin. This accounting practice correctly reflected inflation over time. However the VOC's accounting guilder of 20 stuivers was fixed at the 1608 valuation of the 25.7g rijksdaalder at 48 stuiver. In practice, the rijksdaalder proved less desirable than the better-known Spanish 8 Real coin, and as the rijksdaalder contained more silver, they disappeared from circulation. As a result, the VOC shipped the Spanish coin in large quantities, and it was the standard large coin of the Indies, used in official transactions, and given the same 48 stuiver value as the rijksdaalder. Small change intended for local use did not need to be accepted outside the Indies, so Dutch silver 1 stuiver, 2 stuiver (dubbeltjes, known as 'uang'), and 6 stuiver (schillings) coins were imported. The less valuable lead picis cash coins continued to circulate. The materials for these were supplied by the Dutch. However they had no official exchange value. With 411 tons of lead supplied between 1633 and 1640, at least a billion coins were produced in that period alone (weighing only 0.7 g each, against the 3.5 g of copper in the original Chinese cash). Due to oversupply, their production then became unprofitable, but resumed later. These coins remained in demand until the mid-18th century, and production only ended in 1763. VOC officials discovered that large silver coins were being removed from circulation and exported, something they believed reflected a higher (by about 20%) price for silver in Asia. As a result, in 1640 the rijksdaalder (valued at 50 stuivers in the Netherlands) and the Spanish 8 Real were both increased in value to 60 stuiver coins, thereby making it unprofitable to exchange small change for large coins. In 1644 the VOC instructed a Chinese resident of Batavia named Conjok to mint copper coinage in denominations of a half and quarter stuiver to address the shortage of low denomination money. The VOC administrators in the Netherlands ordered this minting to cease after only five weeks, so not many coins were minted. The first VOC silver coins were issued in 1645 by Dutch goldsmith Jan Ferman along with Conjok, in denominations of 48, 24 and 12 stuivers, otherwise known as the Batavian Crown, Half and Quarter Crown. These were made from Japanese silver bars as an emergency measure to address the lack of large silver coins due to the locals selling the large Dutch silver coins to Chinese traders for a profit. The Crown weighed of a Dutch lion thaler, which was then worth 48 stuivers. Due to counterfeiting, the coins were withdrawn two years later, in 1647. These coins, the first to bear the VOC monogram, and the last until 1724, are now very scarce. The Directors of the VOC in Amsterdam disapproved of the increased valuation of the rijksdaalder and 8 Real coins, and it was ended in 1651. The Batavian administrators continued to argue for it, and in 1655 the 25% devaluation was restored. However Amsterdam ordered that the small coins be devalued by 25%, and large coins by 20% (in relation to the Netherlands, where the 8 Real was worth 50 stuivers). In the Indies the Dutch stuiver coin was thus worth 1.25 stuiver, and the rijksdaalder and Eight Real 60 stuiver. To subdivide the Indies stuiver, in 1658 an official issue of the lari known as Tangs—'fish hook' coins made of copper (based on money in use in South Asia)—was attempted. A tang was equal to a quarter 'Indies stuiver', with five equalling the Dutch stuiver coin. The tang were to be officially stamped to prevent clipping, but this was unsuccessful as the copper proved too hard to work. A revised order authorising production in pewter followed in 1660. As only one specimen is known to survive, it seems that this was not a successful issue. Batavian officials in 1658 restored the ratio of 60:1 between stuiver coin and the Eight Real coin, introducing the concept of 'light' and 'heavy' stuiver. The Eight Real was worth sixty 'heavy stuivers' and the stuiver coin one 'heavy stuiver', while in 'light' stuivers, things were valued 25% higher, so a stuiver coin was worth 1.25 'light' stuivers, and the rijksdaalder was worth 75 'light' stuivers. These concepts were essentially a misdirection of the Amsterdam administration designed to enable the Batavian officials to make private profits at the VOC's expense. VOC officials manipulated the system, paying 'light' money in Batavia and receiving heavy in Amsterdam, at the expense of the VOC. The system caused great confusion, but 'light' money was not abolished until 1742 locally, and in 1766 in the VOC accounts. With thirty 2-stuiver coins containing more silver than an 8 Real, the two-stuiver coins soon disappeared from circulation, for melting at a profit. In addition to the 8 Real, a number of other large coins were in use. These included the Dutch silver ducat (which replaced the rijksdaalder from 1659, and contained slightly less silver than the 8 Real, though it was valued the same), the Dutch lion thaler and cross thaler and the ducaton. Gold coinage included the Dutch gold ducat, as well as the Japanese koban gold plaque and ichi-bu gold coin—all of which were at various times in the late 17th century subject to countermarking, a measure designed to keep genuine, high-quality coins in use, but which were all ended as the countermarks could also be falsified. In the last decade of the 17th century, the Indian silver rupee was introduced to the Indies by the Dutch, who initially (from 1693) counterstamped the coins, and valued them at 30 stuivers, an excessive value given the silver weight of only 11.44 grams, and led to large numbers of rupees being imported. Other late 17th century countermarking efforts included a 1686 initiative to counterstamp imported ducatons (which were thereby given greater value), rijksdaalders and half ducatons. This measure ended in 1692. Another counterstamping measure was of the silver stuiver coins of Zeeland, which were counterstamped from 1687 for a number of years. 1724—introduction of the duit The VOC wished to introduce copper coinage, replacing the picis (the supply of which had been interrupted by the Japanese), and began to import Dutch duit in 1724 from the province of Holland. These were valued at 4 duit to the heavy stuiver (i.e. the Dutch stuiver coin), twice the value that they had in the Netherlands. This created an obvious arbitrage opportunity, and the coins were withdrawn in 1725. Although two of the Dutch provinces had granted their VOC Companies permission to mint coins in the name of Batavia in 1624, the Dutch Parliament withheld its assent to this, and no such VOC coinage was issued until 1726, when there were two different classes of duits: those circulating in the Netherlands, valued at stuiver, and those circulating in the Indies at stuiver. By declaring that only duits bearing the 'VOC' monogram would be legal tender in the Indies, the VOC could keep its (clearly highly profitable) monopoly on these coins, though the high value of duits relative to their intrinsic worth did mean that duit forgeries were common in the Indies. Holland and Zeeland issued the first VOC copper duit coins, bearing their respective arms, and those two provinces along with West Friesland also issued VOC ducatons (one ounce silver coins). The Dutch Parliament objected to the ducatons, arguing that the designs were unapproved, and threatened a fine of 1,000 ducatons per ducaton issued. The provinces backed down, and all specimens were melted down. A new design for VOC ducatons was then submitted and assent given, with the first VOC ducatons issued in 1728 by, and bearing the arms of, each of the six provinces that constituted the companies of the VOC. VOC ducatons were minted in many of the years between 1728 and 1751 by one or more of these six provinces. Several million coins were minted in total. Far more VOC duits were minted than that. As with the ducaton, they were modelled on the Dutch duits that were the first to be shipped to the Indies, but unlike the 1726 ducatons, they were not recalled, and thus the first VOC duits date from that year. Duits were issued by Utrecht (most years from 1742 to 1794), Holland (most years from 1726 to 1793), Gelderland (1731 and 1732, then most years from 1771 to 1794), Zeeland (most years from 1726 to 1794), and West Friesland (most years from 1729 to 1794). Each coin bore the crowned arms of the respective province on the obverse, and the VOC monogram, date and the respective mintmarks; minor changes were made to the design of the duits over the period of issue. Silver and gold presentation strikes exist. Half duit coins, featuring the same designs (except Utretcht's, which lacked the lion supporters on the Utrecht shield seen on the full duit) but with half the weight, were much less popular, and were minted only by Utrecht (between 1752 and 1770), Holland (1749 to 1754, and 1769–1770), Gelderland (1788 and 1789), Zeeland (1770–1772 and 1789), and West Friesland (1769 and 1770). No double duits were minted at all. Along with the imported duits, in 1764, 1765 and 1783, duits were produced under authority of the Company in Java, with one side inscribed 'DUYT JAVAS [date]', and the other the same text in Arabic. These coins lacked both VOC monogram and arms. The duit gradually became more popular over the 18th century. Ten million were sent to the Indies in the 1770s alone. They circulated alongside the picis for most of the 18th century, and by 1800 the duit had superseded the inconvenient picis in Java. During the second half of the 18th century, old clipped silver stuivers were valued at 4 duits, and new ones at 5 duits. Batavian MintGold Javan ducat= The Batavian mint opened in 1744, following a treaty with Pakubuwono II, first Susuhunan of Mataram, which for the first time gave the VOC the right to mint coinage. Between 1744 and 1808, however, total coin production was valued at only around 4 million gulden. The mint's first product was the Javan gold ducats or dirhams, produced 1744–1746, valued at four silver rupees, and made of 4.3 g of fine gold, with writing only in Arabic. Double ducats (also gold) were minted 1746–1748. Very few were issued. After 1748, minting of the Javan ducat ended, due to counterfeiting. From 1753, imported gold Dutch ducats began to be counterstamped in Batavia with the Arabic letters 'DJAWA', and valued at 6 gulden and 12 stuivers, against 6 gulden for unstamped coins—a measure designed to discourage private import/export of the coins. Counterstamping ended in 1761 when its counterfeiting was noticed. =Silver Javan rupee= Netherlands Indies silver Java rupee 1803. As the silver Indian rupee was a popular coin locally (reduced in value from 30 to 27 stuivers in 1735), a local version of it was issued in 1747, with Arabic text (reading 'Dirham [money] of the Dutch Company' and 'For the island Java the Great'), and only the date in Roman script, valued at 30 stuivers, identical in weight to the Surat rupee of the Mughal Empire. This continued only until in 1750, as it did not generate much profit. Subsequently, as with imported gold coinage, some imported rupees were counterstamped between 1753 and 1761, and given a 30 stuiver value. The Batavian mint once again struck the silver rupee from 1764 to 1767, valued at 30 stuivers, but in early 1768 production ceased as enough silver coinage had been produced. Production resumed from 1783 to early 1789, and again from 1795 until 1798. The counterstamping of European gold ducatons was not a successful venture, and accordingly in 1766 gold single, double, and quadruple rupees, of 4, 8, and 16 grams of 20 carat gold, were produced. They were struck from the same dies used to make contemporary silver rupees. But due to counterfeiting, the coins were withdrawn from circulation in 1768. The coins were also referred to as 'quarter', 'half', and 'whole' rupees, as 16 silver rupees were worth a 'whole' rupee, on the same way that 16 Silver Indian Rupees equated to 1 Gold Mohur. Whole and half gold rupees were issued in 1783–1785, in a few thousand of each denomination. Production of whole and half rupees resumed in 1796–1798. Although the VOC was nationalised in 1800, production of silver and gold rupees continued, and half gold rupees were issued 1800–1803 and 1807, with silver rupees issued 1800–1808, and half silver rupees also issued in 1805 and 1806. Paper money The VOC merged its deposit (De Bank Courant, established 1752) and lending banks (De Bank van Leening, established 1746) in 1752 as De Bank Courant en Bank van Leening, and began issuing paper money denominated in rijksdaalders, and earning % interest per month (reduced later to % and then to %). This bank paper became popular for its convenience. Due to a lack of silver in the Indies caused by the war between the Dutch and English, the VOC began to issue credit paper in 1782. This credit paper was used to underwrite the bank paper, but due to lack of coin, the paper money lost its value, falling 20% by 1789. The bank was finally closed down by the VOC on 7 April 1794 due to lack of enough capital to meet its obligations, with all notes due for exchange within 2 months. Silver VOC coinage Aside from the numerous varieties of VOC duit, the other major development of 18th-century Indies coinage occurred from 1786, when European powers started issuing colonial silver coinage in greater quantity, finally satisfying local demand (which led to fluctuating local values between large and small silver coins and between silver and copper). The denominations were 10 Stuiver ( Gulden), 1 Gulden and 3 Gulden. Dates range from 1786 to 1791. The Dutch ducaton was valued at 80 stuiver, the various Indian and local rupees at 30 stuiver, and the 8 Real at 64 stuiver. Copper bonk stuiver Starting from 1796, the mint in Batavia began to produce heavy 'copper bonk' (bonk being Dutch for 'large piece') coinage formed from long copper bars imported from Japan, stamped with the denomination and date were produced. The coins exhibited significant variation in weight, and were crudely made. Denominations were 1 and 2 stuivers, with a weight of approximately 23 and 46 grams respectively (equivalent to the weight of 4 and 8 individual duit). Unlike similar money produced for Ceylon, they lacked the VOC monogram. Stuiver coins The Batavian mint began in 1799 the production of 1 stuiver coinage, formed of the lead-bronze of melted cannons, and weighing about 12 g each. These are dated 1799 and 1800. Batavian Republic The VOC was nationalised by the Netherlands (the Batavian Republic) in 1800, and a Council for Eastern Possessions was established to administer it. It was determined that the Indies had a great shortage of copper coinage, and so the minting of duits resumed at four mints in the Netherlands. Three of these used old VOC designs with new dates (from 1802 to 1806), while the fourth, the designated central mint of the new Republic at Enkhuyzen, bore the inscription 'INDIA BATAV' where the VOC monogram had been, and with the arms of the Crowned States instead of the individual province's arms. These coins bore a value: 5 [ duit coins equals] G [gulden] on the half duit, and 5 [equals] G on the duit—the coins had been originally intended for use in the Cape of Good Hope, but due to the loss of that colony, where the duit was higher valued, they were sent to the Indies instead, at an initial value of 6 to the Gulden. These latter duits were issued dated 1802–1809. Silver coins of the Batavian East Indies, all dated 1802, were of , , , and 1 gulden—the stuiver now formed purely in copper. Aside from duit coins, the production of copper bonk stuiver continued under the Batavian Republic, but 1803 saw the weight of the stuiver reduced to 19 grams, thus devaluing the stuiver from gulden to gulden. Also 8 stuiver bonks were produced in 1803, as well as stuiver bonks in 1804 and 1805, the latter being withdrawn in 1805 as a result of its short copper content leading to counterfeiting by cutting up higher denominations. A private enterprise established in 1806 saw yet more VOC-branded duits in issue, these bearing the monogram on one side and the word JAVA and the date on the other. Kingdom of Holland With the Batavian Republic in the Netherlands having collapsed, the new administration of the Kingdom of Holland under the authority of Louis Napoleon, appointed Herman Willem Daendels as Governor-General. Daendels borrowed 736,00 rijksdaalders in the form of credit paper. These borrowings lacked backing with sufficient silver, and increased the money supply. The old De Bank Courant en Bank van Leening was reopened in 1809. Daendels appropriated the private Javan duit-issuing enterprise in 1808, gradually replacing the VOC mongram with the simple letters 'LN'. In the period 1808–1810 both forms of duit were minted, while 1811 duits only exist bearing the LN monogram. In addition to the duits, stuiver and stuiver pieces were minted locally in copper in 1810 and 1811, while many foreign coins were counterstamped LN. The only coins to be imported from Holland during this period were duit and duit coins of the 'INDIA BATAV' pattern. The counterstamps foreign coins are forgeries made in the beginning of the 1900s. British rule The Dutch administration, since 1810 led by Governor- General Jan Willem Janssens, was replaced following the British invasion of Java in 1811, and the appointment of Stamford Raffles as Governor-General. Raffles initially re-established the 8 Real (rather than the rijksdaalder) as the standard coin, recalling 8.5 million rijksdaalder of banknotes for silver. Spanish Dollar bankpaper was issued in 1812. Subsequently, the British minted silver rupees (of the same weight as previous issues, and still worth 30 stuivers or 120 duit) and half rupees, the latter seen as a convenient new denomination for payment, from 1811 to 1817 bearing Javanese and Arabic text and dates, as well as gold half mohurs (rupees) of 1813–1816, this activity continuing for a couple of years after return to Netherlands authority. After the introduction of the rupee, the British began issuing Javan rupee bank paper instead of Real A shortage of copper currency was found; copper duits were produced in 1811–1812 bearing the British East India Company's mark 'VEIC', 'JAVA', and the date. A lack of raw copper led to an experiment with melted cannon; this succeeded only in destroying the dies. A request by Raffles to Calcutta mint to produce 50 million duit could not be met, and so the British produced 50 million tin duits in 1813 and 1814, at roughly half the weight of the copper duits. These coins were not widely accepted and over a million were returned, and on the return to Dutch control, the Dutch refused to recognise the coins. A request for copper three and six stuiver coins could not be met due to the inadequacy of the mint machinery, and instead stuivers (1814 and 1815) and copper half stuivers (1811–1815) were produced. Dutch rule (restored) Dutch rule was restored in 1814–1816 as a result of the treaty between the Netherlands and Britain returning the former Dutch possessions. The first coins to be minted were at the Surabaya mint: duits (1814–1826) and half duits (1814–1822) of the 'INDIA BATAV' design. The half duits were updated to read ST (stuiver), minted 1822–1826, while ST coins were minted 1822–1826. As no double duit designs existed of modern design, that coin only appeared as ST, from 1818 to 1828. Starting from 1822, 'INDIA BATAV' was replaced with 'NEDERL INDIE' on all coins. One gulden from the first Dutch government issued paper money in the Netherlands Indies (1815). The Indies government in 1815 issued a series of credit paper, with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 300, 600 and 1000 gulden. De Bank Courant en Bank van Leening, which was woefully short of capital, was nationalized in 1817. The Dutch closed the bank in 1818, giving people six months to exchange their banknotes before they were declared worthless. There had long been a shortage of copper coinage in the Indies, and as a consequence Chinese and Japanese copper coins were in general circulation. French centime coins had been imported in 1811, but subsequently withdrawn; in 1818 to address the shortage, copper bonks were once again issued in , 1, and 2 stuiver denominations. Although 400,000 gulden-worth were produced, they had been severely debased at 15 g of copper to the stuiver, and they were eventually withdrawn in 1826. The Surabaya mint, closed in 1828, was reopened as a consequence of the high demand for coinage created by the Cultivation System. Duit and double duit coins, which had, on the initiative of the mint, the decimal denominations 1 C (cent) and 2 C, were minted 1833–1841; in total around one billion 1 cent and half a billion 2-cent coins were minted, which, alongside the minting of 1790-dated 'Utrecht' VOC duits (which were minted locally, as the VOC duits were popular with the population, using imported dies of the 18th century design but with different mintmarks) in 1827, 1834, 1835, 1840, 1841, 1842 and 1843. The only ever VOC double duits, also dated 1790, were minted 1840–1843. With demand finally satiated, in 1843 the Batavia and Surabaya mints were closed permanently, and all subsequent Indies coinage was imported. The first silver coinage minted for the colony were 99,000 gulden coins minted in Utrecht in 1821 (several million more were minted in 1839 and 1840). gulden and gulden coins were minted in 1826 and 1827 in numbers over a million, with the former also minted in 1840. Coinage was finally fully decimalised in 1854, with copper , 1 and 2 cents and silver , and gulden (although the 1821–1840 coinage continued to circulate). The new coinage bore Arabic script alongside Dutch language, which earlier Dutch-minted had not done. The gulden was only issued in 1854 and 1855, because it was too small to be convenient, but all other denominations continued to be issued until 1945, with copper changing to bronze from 1914, the addition of silver 1 and gulden coins in 1943 (in earlier years regular Dutch coins of , 1 and gulden had circulated alongside the Indies ones), and a copper-nickel 5-cent that was issued in 1913, 1921 and 1922. No coins in any denomination were minted between 1861 and 1881. The last coins are dated 1941–1945 and were minted in the USA while the Dutch were tied up in World War II and the Japanese were ruling the Indies. De Javasche Bank King William I of the Netherlands granted the right to create a bank in the Indies in 1826. The bank, known as \\"De Javasche Bank\\" (DJB), was opened in Batavia on 24 January 1828, with exclusive rights to operate for 10 years, until 31 December 1837. Authorised capital was 8000 shares of 500 gulden, to be sold in four tranches of 2000 shares each. Its first issue of bank paper was made on 11 March 1828, after the bank had received subscriptions in gold and silver for 2043 shares. The notes were in denominations of 25 up to 1000 gulden (the bank was not allowed to issue notes below 10 gulden), totalling 1.12 million gulden of issued paper. The bank opened branches in Semarang and Surabaya in 1829. Due to a lack of bullion reserves, towards the end of the expiry of the first rights, 'kopergeld', or copper money notes, were issued. These were redeemable on the basis of 'tegen honderd duiten de gulden'—or 100 duit to the gulden. recepis\\" issued . The bank's rights were renewed for a further ten years from 1838, with the second tranche of shares sold. Further copper notes were issued in 1842–1845. Due to a lack of silver coinage in circulation, a series of \\"recepis\\" for silver were issued for which the copper notes were exchanged at a rate of 6 copper gulden to 5 recepis gulden. The recepis were also exchangeable for other commercial paper, although not legal tender (only the bank's 1828 notes were legal tender). The banks rights were renewed again from 1848 to 1858, with no further capital acquired. On 8 May 1854, the government announced that Dutch currency (of 1847 and later) was legal tender in the Indies. The bank's rights were temporarily extended until 31 March 1860, and the silver recipes were deemed exchangeable with any valid payment instrument. De Javasche Bank-5 Gulden (1866) The bank's fourth exclusive rights were granted from 1860 to 1870, increasing the bank's capital to the full 4 million gulden, permitting the bank to open branches outside Java, and extending the range of bank paper issuable down to 10 gulden as well as allowing larger denominations. It was provided that the bank should guarantee two-thirds of the value of its banknotes with valid payment instruments. Thus the second series of bank notes was issued in 1861 in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 gulden, and the 1846 silver recipes were withdrawn. DJB opened branches in Padang (August 1864), Surakarta (November 1867), Makassar (December 1864), Cirebon (August 1866) and Pasuruan (November 1867). In 1864 a new design of banknotes was introduced, including new 5 gulden, 200 gulden and 300 gulden denominations. The bank's rights were once again renewed, from 1870 to 1881, and capital was increased to six million gulden. The Yogyakarta branch was opened in 1878. The bank's rights were extended 1881 to 1891, and it was reincorporated as a new company, with the same capital of six million gulden in 1881. The bank's rights were extended for 15 years from 1891 to 1906, at which point an office was opened (in 1891) in Amsterdam. New banknote designs were introduced from 1897 depicting JP Coen. The bank's rights were extended again from 1906 to 1921. Due to metal supply issues, the government was first authorised after World War 1 to issue treasury notes (denominations below 5 gulden, which were in the issue of the central bank), which it did in 1919. The same metal supply issue arose in 1940, during World War 2, with low value notes of , 1 and gulden. The series of Exclusive Rights were brought to an end in 1922, with De Javasche Bank Act, and the bank's capital was increased by 50% to 9 million gulden. The bank was prohibited from issuing notes of less than 5 gulden, and all banknote designs were to be officially published. A new series of banknotes was issued, recalling all old bank paper. The notes again depicted JP Coen. They ranged from 5 gulden to 1000 gulden, and were issued from 1925 to 1931. New notes showing wayang dancers began to be issued from 1934, in 5 and 10 gulden denominations, and from 1939 to 1939 in denominations from 5 to 1000 gulden, but due to the economic conditions of the time, few of the higher denominations were never issued. One Gulden, Japanese occupation currency, Dutch East Indies In 1942, the Japanese successfully invaded the Indies, bringing with their invasion fleet their own version of the gulden, in denominations of 1, 5 and 10 cents, , 1, 5 and 10 gulden. By 1944 they had decided that engendering a collective Asian nationalism would be the key to keeping control, and they replaced the Dutch-style gulden notes by the Netherlands Indies roepiah, an Indonesian-language version of the gulden. The Dutch government in exile ordered notes for issue on their return to Indonesia, and these were printed in the US in 1942, dated 1943. They began to be issued in the eastern islands of the archipelago (which the Dutch captured early on) from 1944 to 1945. Because of Dutch fears about damage to De Javasche Bank from the war, they were issued under the authority of the Dutch government instead, hence they were known as the 'NICA Gulden' (Netherlands Indies Civil Administration gulden). In Java and Sumatra, Indonesian nationalists were insurgent, and the Dutch were initially confined to only a few cities. In both islands the Japanese invasion money continued to circulate among both Indonesian and Dutch, until supplies ran out. The issue in 1946 of the first Indonesian rupiah by the provisional Republican government in Jakarta resulted in conflict between the rival currencies and administrations. The Dutch money was not tolerated by the Indonesian nationalists, who insisted on the use of only Indonesian money. After 1946 De Javasche Bank resumed note production, with 5, 10 and 25 gulden notes. These bore in Indonesian language the word \\"roepiah\\". The NICA gulden, on the other hand, bore the image of the Dutch Queen, and was far from sensitive to nationalist feeling. Further notes simply saying \\"Indonesia\\" were issued in 10 and 25 sen denominations in 1947. Between 1946 and 1948 the Dutch succeeded in expanding the area of land under their control, but international feeling was against them, so in November 1949, peace was brokered. One of the conditions was that \\"De Javasche Bank\\" remained as the central bank of the new nation of \\"Republik Indonesia Serikat\\" (United States of Indonesia). Thus the first internationally recognised currency of the new nation of Indonesia still bore the words \\"gulden\\", and \\"De Javasche Bank\\", reusing the 1946 (even retaining the date, 1946) De Javasche Bank notes, changing only the colour, and with additional denominations of 50, 100, 500 and 1000 gulden. Further De Javasche Bank notes, in a new design, were dated \\"1948\\", with , 1 and gulden denominations, and were also issued upon Indonesian independence, along with new 'Republik Indonesia Serikat' notes in 5 and 10 rupiah (not gulden) denominations. The feeling for \\"Indonesianization\\" was strong, and so De Javasche Bank was nationalized and renamed as \\"Bank Indonesia\\" over the period 1951 to 1953, and Bank Indonesia rupiah notes began to replace the gulden from 1953.

In 1976 at age 38, he was appointed president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Bendix Corporation. From 1988 to 1995, Agee was the chairman, president, and CEO of Morrison-Knudsen. Agee was a business consultant, venture capitalist, and chairman of a charitable foundation. He received six honorary doctorate degrees and sat on the boards of Fortune 500 corporations including Equitable Life and Dow Jones as well as Bendix and Morrison Knudsen. In 1979, Agee was featured in a Time magazine cover story titled \\"Faces of the Future\\", and was named Finance magazine's \\"Financial Man of the Year\\" in 1976. Early years Born as William McReynolds Agee in Boise, Idaho, he was the middle child (and only son) of Harold J. and Suzanne (McReynolds) Agee. Harold, the son of a Baptist minister, had varied careers: manufacturing executive, dairy farmer, and state legislator. Harold moved the family to a dairy farm in nearby Meridian in 1953, and Bill transferred to Meridian High at age 15. He quickly established himself as a bright and popular student with leadership skills. Agee was elected class president in that first year as a sophomore and again in his senior year. He was a multi- sport varsity athlete and was named one of the two most studious members of his class, which graduated in 1956. Education After graduation from Meridian High School in 1956, in Agee attended Stanford University for one year before dropping out. He enrolled in the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he joined the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, unusual for a married man. He earned an associate's degree while working 40 hours per week in Albertson's accounting department. Agee was elected senior class president and graduated with highest honors in 1960. During the summer of 1959, Agee, along with his parents, played the part of the Dixon family in the ephemeral film Last Clear Chance. Following graduation, Agee worked for the Title Insurance Company in Boise. He was promoted to controller and senior escrow officer at the age of 23. Agee enrolled in the Harvard Business School in 1961 and was awarded a Masters in Business Administration (MBA), with distinction, in 1963. He became a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in 1964 and joined the American and Idaho societies of CPAs. Boise Cascade Agee was hired by Boise Cascade Corporation at age 25. Starting as Executive Assistant to CEO Bob Hansberger, Agee was appointed Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in 1969 at age 31, and Senior Vice President in 1971. Boise Cascade's stock price rapidly rose to $77 in 1969, then fell to $15 in the fall of 1971. After nine years, he left Boise in late May 1972, and the stock price was around $14. Bendix Agee joined Bendix Corporation, an automobile industry related manufacturer located near Detroit, Michigan, in May 1972. He had been recruited for the post by Bendix's then-CEO, Michael Blumenthal. Agee became CFO and Executive Vice President, and held a seat on the Board of Directors. He was elected President of the company in December 1976 at the age of 38, and was elevated to CEO a few weeks later when Blumenthal left Bendix to become the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the new Carter Administration. Agee was recognized in Time magazine Time staff reporter.\\"Just Friends,\\" Time, February 8, 1982 for his strategy of bold, selective acquisitions aimed at transforming Bendix from a slow-growth manufacturing company in a mature industry, into a diversified high-tech corporation. Agee's strategy dramatically increased the stock value of Bendix during Agee's tenure despite a recession that afflicted two of its traditionally main businesses, automobile parts and machine tools. While competitors floundered in 1981, Bendix' profits increased 136% and its fiscal year revenues rose to $4.4 billion. Agee was an unorthodox executive for the 1970s, often dressing in business casual attire years before it was in vogue. He removed the traditional boardroom table, replacing it with large, comfortable chairs to improve communication.Time staff reporter.\\"Business: Bendix Abuzz,\\" Time, October 6, 1980. He abolished reserved parking for top executives, allowing the best parking spots to go to employees who arrived at the office the earliest. He was known for promoting young employees based upon merit rather than seniority. This practice caused a flurry of media interest in 1980 when he promoted 28-year-old Mary Cunningham, who had been his executive assistant, to the position of vice president for corporate communications and then VP for Strategic Planning.Mary Cunnningham Agee.

A nationally publicized account of an alleged office romance between Agee and Cunningham – which both denied – led to Cunningham's resignation in October 1980 when she felt she could no longer effectively do her job. Both Agee and Cunningham divorced their spouses and married in June 1982. Agee sought to expand Bendix by launching a takeover bid for rival Martin Marietta. On August 25, 1982, Bendix announced it had purchased 1.6 million shares of Martin Marietta for $40 million. Martin Marietta fought the hostile takeover by attempting to acquire Bendix, employing the Pac-Man defense, in which a company that is threatened with a takeover, attempts to turn the tables by acquiring its would-be buyer. At one point, Bendix owned a majority of Martin Marietta shares, while Martin Marietta, in turn owned a majority of Bendix shares. Neither Agee nor Marietta President Thomas Pownall would concede defeat, with Pownall refusing even to meet with Agee. When Marietta enlisted the help of a third company, United Technologies, Agee sought a partner to fend off the threatened takeover of Bendix. Agee eventually found Edward Hennessy of Allied Corp., who offered a way out of the stand-off: Allied would take possession of Marietta's shares of Bendix in exchange for the return of Bendix's Marietta holdings. In effect, Martin Marietta would remain an independent company while Bendix would become a subsidiary of Allied. Agee resigned from Bendix following the merger.Time staff reporter.\\"High Noon: Showdown Time for Bendix\\",Time, September 20, 1982. Morrison Knudsen From 1988 to 1995 Agee was Chairman, President and CEO of the construction company Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MK) in his hometown of Boise. He had served on MK's Board of Directors for several years, and was the Board's choice to step in as CEO and President. At that time, a hostile takeover attempt by Chicago businessman Edward Heil and record losses threatened the company's existence. Agee thwarted the takeover and returned the failing Morrison Knudsen to profitability within one year.Time staff reporter. \\"The Wreck of Morrison Knudsen\\", Time, April 3, 1995. By 1990, Agee had made the company highly profitable and it was debt-free. Agee employed a diversification strategy which changed the company from one which was primarily reliant on heavy construction to one which was involved in railroad remanufacturing, precious minerals, and the transit business. Agee formed MK Gold and MK Rail, and was appointed CEO of each. He moved out of company headquarters in Boise to run the enterprise from his home in Pebble Beach. MK had record profits between 1989 and 1991, much of which derived from operating revenue, accounting decisions (cooked books), and non-traditional sources of income such as investments. When the rail business disintegrated after the loss of several contracts, MK found itself unable to return to its core businesses. In February 1995, when MK announced a loss of $310 million for fiscal year 1994, the MK board voted to terminate Agee. A leak of an intended Agee resignation drew broad media attention which resulted in Agee resigning earlier than originally planned. Nearing bankruptcy in 1996, Morrison-Knudsen merged with Dennis Washington's Washington Construction Group in May, and later became Washington Group International, based at MK's headquarters in Boise. Business consultancy Agee was Chairman of Semper Charitable Foundation, the Semper family's charitable foundation, and chaired Semper Partners, a venture capital and consulting firm founded in partnership with his wife, Mary Cunningham Agee. An example of Agee's success in venture capital and consulting was the growth and sale of Mozzarella Fresca, a company that he helped develop into the largest fresh mozzarella manufacturer in the West with customers ranging from Whole Foods to Domino's Pizza.\\"Mozzarella Fresca Makes History\\" , dBusinessNews, April 6, 2010. Agee served on the Board of Directors of Fortune 500 firms including Dow Jones (1978–1993), the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (1974–1977), Morrison Knudsen (1974–1977 and 1981–1985) Equitable Life (1976–1985), ASARCO (1979–1981), and General Foods (1979–1983).Time staff reporter.Golden Goodbye, Time, February 21, 1983. Agee also served as a Director of Allied Corporation, MK Gold Company, MK Rail Corporation, LoJack Corporation and Key Bank Corp. Other directorships included the Committee for Economic Development, National Council for U.S. - China Trade, the Urban Institute, the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, the Detroit Renaissance Foundation, the United Foundation, the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and the Cranbrook Education Community. Death Agee died at age 79 from complications of respiratory failure caused by vascular degeneration, Alzheimer's Disease, and Scleroderma, a connective tissue disease, at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle on December 20, 2017. Awards and honors Agee received honorary doctorates from the University of Detroit (1980), Lawrence Institute of Technology (1980), Eastern Michigan University (1980), Bryant College, Cleary University, and Nathaniel Hawthorne College.

Since the cuticle of these animals is also the skeletal support of the body and is inelastic, it is shed during growth and a new covering of larger dimensions is formed. During this process, an arthropod becomes dormant for a period of time. Enzymes are secreted to digest the inner layers of the existing cuticle, detaching the animal from the outer cuticle. This allows the new cuticle to develop without being exposed to the environmental elements. After apolysis, ecdysis occurs.

Pelileo is the second largest city in Tungurahua Province behind neighboring Ambato and is famous for the production and sale of blue jeans. Many travelers pass through Pelileo on their way from Ambato to Baños. History Pelileo was founded by Antonio Clavijo in 1570 and was elevated to the status of county on July 22, 1860. On August 5, 1949, Pelileo was totally destroyed by an earthquake. Some 5,000 people died within the limits of the county. The only remaining structure still visible from the old city is a broken stone pillar, once part of Pelileo's magnificent main church. A new city was rebuilt in a nearby location. Currently it is therefore possible to visit both the Great Pelileo (Pelileo Grande), and the New Pelileo (Pelileo Nuevo). Economy Pelileo is also known as the Blue City, because of its booming jean industry, mainly located in the El Tambo parish. Another of the parishes of Pelileo is the world-famous Salasaca, home to a Native American tribe originally from Bolivia that came to the Ecuadorian Andes as mitimaes. The Huambalo parish is well known as the home of artisans of fine furniture. Pelileo is also known for the distillation of a local liquor called aguardiente.

Founded in 1916, the name \\"Mitropa\\" is an acronym of Mitteleuropa (German for Central Europe). The railway carriages displayed a distinct burgundy-red livery with the Mitropa logo. Since a 2002 reorganization, when the onboard catering branch was taken over by DB Fernverkehr, the company only provided stationary food services for rail and road customers. The remaining business was sold to Compass Group in 2004 and merged into the Select Service Partner (SSP) subsidiary in 2006. History The company was founded during World War I on 24 November 1916, as '. Its founders included different railway companies of the Central Powers, i.e. Germany and Austria-Hungary, who discontinued the service provided by the 'enemy'-owned Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL). From the establishment of business activities on 1 January 1917, Mitropa held the monopoly on cross-border dining and sleeping car services, including the Balkans Express from Berlin to Constantinople, introduced to replace the CIWL Orient Express trains. Bernina Express with Mitropa dining cars, 1928 After the war, CIWL was able to take over most routes in Central Europe, while Mitropa maintained most of its routes within Germany and Austria as well as routes to the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Switzerland. From 1928 the company ran diner cars on the Bernina and Rhaetian Railway lines as well as on the pullman coaches of the Rheingold luxury train competing with the CIWL Edelweiss service. Mitropa also catered Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft passenger ships and the Baltic ferry link from Sassnitz to Trelleborg. Mitropa sleeper with Betten frei (beds available) sign, 1932 In those times, Mitropa developed its burgundy-red corporate design, with a modern font and the distinctive 'M' logo styled by Karl Schulpig (1884–1948). From 1927, it also sponsored the Mitropa Cup, one of the first international football competitions for club sides. The company prospered between the wars and managed about 750 coaches by 1940, however, it never came close to the size of CIWL. While from 1933 the corporate management was brought into line in the course of the Nazi Gleichschaltung process, several employees on board were organised in a clandestine trade union movement and made use of their professional activity to smuggle secret messages and material across international borders. In March 1939 the company banned German Jews and Jews without nationality from using dining or sleeping cars. In World War II the company's business was seriously limited, while on the other hand Mitropa temporarily ran former CIWL services in territories controlled by the Wehrmacht, including a restaurant at Warsaw Main Station (Dworzec Główny) in occupied Poland. Dining car services discontinued in 1942 by order of State Secretary Albert Ganzenmüller, the last sleeping car connections were terminated in 1944. In the Cold War and the Division of Germany, Mitropa became the catering company for the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the national railway of East Germany. The Western section of Mitropa split off and named itself German Sleeper and Dining Car Company (Deutsche Schlafwagen- und Speisewagengesellschaft, DSG) to manage the sleeping and dining coaches on the Deutsche Bundesbahn railway lines in the Federal Republic. Mitropa sleeper in Dresden, 1972 Based at East Berlin, Mitropa AG was one of the very few stock companies that remained in existence during the Communist era in East Germany. Beside sleepers and dining cars, it ran restaurants at all major stations, on passenger ships, and on Baltic ferries. In 1961 the company took over the East German motorway service areas and opened its first motel in 1971. After German reunification in October 1990, both Mitropa and DSG continued to operate in their respective areas of Germany until 1 January 1994, when Reichsbahn and Bundesbahn were merged to form Deutsche Bahn AG. Mitropa and DSG were also re- merged under the Mitropa logo. This was one of the very few instances, and the most prominent, in which a West German company was \\"taken over\\" by an East German one, as Mitropa was the surviving entity after the merger. The new Mitropa continued catering to travellers on rail, road, and water and provided services at railway stations. As expenses could not be met, the on-board ship business on the Baltic ferries was sold to Scandlines in 1999/2000. On 1 July 2002, the traditional core business of railway catering and sleepers was handed over to DB Reise & Touristik AG, renamed DB Fernverkehr in 2003, a hundred-percent subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG. Sleeper-coaches on Deutsche Bahn trains were managed by City Night Line services. On 1 April 2004 the remainder of Mitropa AG was sold to the German branch of the Compass Group and transformed into a limited liability company (GmbH). It operated food services at railway stations and motorway service. Since 2006, Mitropa has operated under the name SSP Deutschland GmbH. Movies Wumag Mitropa diner in Sonneberg, 2009 In the movie Enemy at the Gates, Major Erwin König (Ed Harris) is shown in a plush Mitropa dining car en route to Stalingrad when he notices on the opposite track returning Mitropa couchette cars full of wounded soldiers. The movie Europa by Lars von Trier, set in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany in 1945, involves a company called Zentropa which runs dining and sleeping cars. The company is based on Mitropa, according to the director's commentary on the DVD. In the movie Goodbye Lenin the lead character, Alex Kerner (Daniel Brühl), instructs his sister's boyfriend Rainer (Alexander Beyer) to lie about his employment as a manager at Burger King and claim that he is a food purchaser for a Mitropa restaurant. In the seventh episode of the movie Seventeen Moments of Spring, the logos of the company are visible, when the General, Stierlitz's travel companion walks through the railway station. Other The opening of a Café Mitropa in West Berlin in 1979, then a popular venue for artists and bohèmiens, met with protest by the East German Mitropa AG who enforced the renaming as Café M. A \\"Friends of Mitropa\\" (Freunde der Mitropa) association for classic dining car restoration was founded on 28 November 1996.

Methodology Ang relies heavily on the use qualitative case studies to illustrate her research instead of using quantitative methods to analyse audiences as was popular. Her first book Watching Dallas relied on the letters of 42 Dutch viewers of the popular television soap Dallas. Ang writes of her analytical method for the letters; they \\"cannot be taken at face value, 'they should be read 'symptomatically': we must search for what is behind the explicitly written, for the presuppositions and accepted attitudes concealed within them. In other words the letters must be regarded as texts, as discourses people produce when they want to express or have to account for their own preference…\\"Ang, Ien 1985 Watching Dallas: Soap Opera and the Melodramatic Imagination, Menthuen, London. p. 11 Furthermore, Ang does not attempt to generalise or triangulate the cases study to apply it to other casesYin, Robert K. 2003, Case Study Research. 3rd edn.

Sage Publications, London, pp45-69 Ang pioneered this method whilst other practitioners were developing pseudo scientific models to apply to the social sciences, Louise Spence a fellow soap opera researcher, praises Ang's methodological style: “She had to redefine the position of the analyst and the language of analysis, challenging the once-dominant ideal of a detached observer using neutral language to describe ‘brute facts’, demystifying the idea of any strict separation of theory and data. Her effort reminds us that researchers are neither innocent nor omniscient”Spence, Louise 2005, Watching Daytime Soap Operas: The Power of Pleasure, Wesleyan University Press, Connecticut.

As the research was carried out in the Netherlands and the case study was the US soap opera Dallas the work also questions how an audience responds to an international export. Ang continues this line of research in her later book ‘’Living Room Wars: Rethinking Media Audience for a Postmodern World‘’ as she researches how national content is influenced by the introduction of international content and the effect this has on both national programming and broadcast stations.Ang, Ien 2006, Living Room Wars: Rethinking Media Audience for a Postmodern World, Routledge, London. The SBS Story This work was co- authored with Gay Hawkins and Lamia Dabboussy, the Australian Special Broadcasting Service cooperated extensively in the collaboration of this work.

The work is chiefly a compilation from former writers; and the preface contains the following summary of the contents of each book: > In the first book you will find every thing that relates to hygiene, and to > the preservation from, and correction of, distempers peculiar to the various > ages, seasons, temperaments, and so forth; also the powers and uses of the > different articles of food, as is set forth in the chapter of contents. In > the second is explained the whole doctrine of fevers, an account of certain > matters relating to them being premised, such as excrementitious discharges, > critical days, and other appearances, and concluding with certain symptoms > that are the concomitants of fever. The third book relates to topical > affections, beginning from the crown of the head, and descending down to the > nails of the feet. The fourth book treats of those complaints that are > external and exposed to view, and are not limited to one part of the body, > but affect various parts. Also, of intestinal worms and dracunculi. The > fifth treats of the wounds and bites of venomous animals; also of the > distemper called hydrophobia, and of persons bitten by dogs that are mad, > and by those that are not mad; and also of persons bitten by men. Afterwards > it treats of deleterious substances, and of the preservatives from them. In > the sixth book is contained every thing relating to surgery, both what > relates to the fleshy parts, such as the extraction of weapons, and to the > bones, which comprehends fractures and dislocations. In the seventh is > contained an account of the properties of all medicines, first of the > simple, then of the compound, particularly of those I had mentioned in the > preceding six books, and more especially the greater, and, as it were, > celebrated preparations; for I did not think it proper to treat of all these > articles promiscuously, lest it should occasion confusion, but so that any > person looking for one or more of the distinguished preparations might > easily find it. Towards the end are certain things connected with the > composition of medicines, and of those articles that may be substituted for > one another, the whole concluding with an account of weights and > measures.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology by William > Smith (1870), Volume 3, pages 152-3 Although Byzantine medicine drew largely on ancient Greek and Roman knowledge, however, his works also contained many new ideas as he was a teacher from Alexandria. For example, in several volumes Paul of Aegina talks about bone structure and fractures, as shown below: > The case of a broken thigh is analogous to that of the arm, but in > particular, a fractured thigh is mostly deranged forwards and outwards, for > the bone is naturally flattened on those sides. It is to be set by the > hands, with ligatures, and even cords applied, the one above and the other > below the fracture. When the fracture takes place at one end, if' at the > head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so > that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perinaeum, and > the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and > applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another > assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the > ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, > with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the > knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, > we arrange the fracture. Pieces of bone that irritate the parts, as has been > often said, are to be taken out from above; and the rest of' the treatment > we have already described in the section on the arm. The thigh gets > consolidated within fifty days. The manner of arranging it afterwards will > be described after delivering the treatment of the whole leg. ::On Fracture > and Contusion of The Thigh and The Nose The work became a standard text throughout the Arabic World for the next 800 or so years.

This area was once known as the Tosa area and the name of the dialect still reflects this older name. The dialect itself developed from the linguistic influence of immigrants to the Tosa area from other parts of Japan and is largely a combination of the Kansai dialect and Chugoku dialects. In particular the accent system used is that of old Kansai-ben. One of the distinctions between Tosa dialect and other Western Japanese dialects is the use of the verb suffixes -yuu and -chuu to show aspect. Grammatically, -yuu encapsulates the continuative and progressive aspects while -chuu separately encapsulates a repeated action or continuing state. In Standard Japanese both are represented by -te-iru. The respective past tense forms are -yotta and -chotta, while the negative forms are -yasen and -chasen. Other distinctive features of Tosa dialect include its clause-ending particles, such as kendo for disjunction, ga as a question marker and ki to denote reason.

Enriquillo's rebellion is the best known rebellion of the early Caribbean period. He is also considered a hero in the modern day Dominican Republic and Haiti for his resistance in favor of the indigenous peoples.Ida Altman, \\"The Revolt of Enriquillo and the Historiography of Early Spanish America,\\" The Americas vol. 63(4)2007, 587-614. Dominican friar Bartolome de Las Casas, who documented and rallied against Spanish abuse of the native peoples, wrote sympathetically of Enriquillo.Bartolome de Las Casas, Historia de las Indias (Mexico, Fondo de Cultura Economico, 1965, second edition, vol. III, p. 260. His father, his aunt Anacaona, and eighty other regional chieftains were killed by Nicolás de Ovando while attending supposed \\"peace talks\\" with the Spanish in Jaragua. During the talks, Spanish soldiers ambushed the chieftains, also known as caciques, set the meeting house on fire, and then proceeded to kill anyone who fled the flames (causing his father's death). Enriquillo, an orphan, was later raised in a Santo Domingo monastery and given the name of \\"Enrico\\" . One of his mentors was Bartolomé de Las Casas. De Las Casas was a Spanish Roman Catholic Priest focused on the rights of Native Americans. Statue of Enriquillo,Museum of the Dominican Man Life Good relations between Christopher Columbus and the indigenous Taíno of the large island Columbus called Hispaniola did not last more than a few days. The Taínos were forced into terrible conditions as laborers in gold mining operations, badly housed in the mountains, poorly fed, extremely overworked, and forced to live in close quarters with the Spaniards. Additionally, due to taking men away from the villages, the cycle of food production was disrupted, causing widespread malnutrition. This malnutrition further aided the Taínos' vulnerability to deadly new types of diseases introduced by the foreigners. After Columbus tortured and killed many in his quest for gold, he turned to slavery and sugar cane plantations as a way to profit from his voyages. Several revolts followed in the first half of the 16th century, the most famous began in 1519. Enriquillo, one of the few remaining caciques, or indigenous chiefs, started the revolt with a large number of Taínos from the mountain range of Bahoruco. The Tainos were able to continue the rebellion because of their better knowledge of the region. As the Spaniards were not able to control the rebellion, a treaty was signed granting to the Native population among others the right of Freedom and of Possession. It had little consequences, however, as by this time the Native population was rapidly declining due to European diseases. Enriquillo also had a wife, called Mencía, later with the noble title Doña due to Enriquillo's high standing and relations with the Spaniards. She was raped by a Spaniard named Valenzuela. When Enriquillo tried to take the issue to the Spanish courts, nothing could be done, since it was Doña Mencia's word against the Spaniard's word. This, according to some writers, was the tipping point for Enriquillo which led to his revolt in the Bahoruco mountains. Guarocuya Most historians agree (see Sued Badillo) that Enriquillo was the same person as the cacique Guarocuya which would mean that Enriquillo belonged to the highest house of the Jaragua cacicazgo. Guarocuya was the nephew of Anacaona, sister to the cacique of Jaragua Bohechío and his eventual successor once Bohechío was killed. Anacaona was married to Caonabo, who was the cacique of the neighboring Maguana kingdom. A minority of historians, however, claim that Guarocuya was captured and hanged, while Enriquillo succeeded in his revolt. Most historians believe both rebels were the same person, arguing that the tales of Guarocuya's demise are identical to the more verifiable accounts of the capture and execution of his aunt Anacaona and the stories have been conflated. It is also well documented that the character of Enriquillo was married to Mencía, the mestiza granddaughter of Anacaona. His name, Enriquillo, would come after his baptism as a Catholic. The name Enriquillo, \\"little Enrique,\\" was probably due to his age at the time of the baptism. Lago Enriquillo The salt water lake Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican province of Baoruco was named after him. Looking out over it is the Trono de Enriquillo, where he is said to have camped during the rebellion. In modern culture The highest rank of the Asociación de Scouts Dominicanos was formerly named after him.

The \\"occult\\" materials in the Manuscripts are a compendium of the classical magical theory and symbolism known in the Western world up until the middle of the 19th century, combined to create an encompassing model of the Western mystery tradition, and arranged into a syllabus of a graded course of instruction in magical symbolism. It was used as the structure for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Manuscripts Folio 13 of the Cipher MMS. The cipher used in the manuscripts, shown in a 1561 edition of Trithemius' Polygraphia. Another cipher known as \\"Theban\\" is given above it. The folios are drawn in black ink on cotton paper watermarked 1809. The text is plain English written from right to left in a simple substitution cryptogram. Numerals are substituted by Hebrew letters – Alef=1, Bet=2, etc. Crude drawings of diagrams, magical implements and tarot cards are interspersed in the text. One final page transcribes into French and Latin.Küntz (1996) The Ciphers contain the outlines of a series of graded rituals and the syllabus for a course of instruction in Qabalah and Hermetic magic, including Astrology, occult tarot, Geomancy and Alchemy. It also contains several diagrams and crude drawings of various ritual implements. The Cipher Manuscripts are the original source upon which the rituals and the knowledge lectures of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were based.Runyon (1997) The actual material itself described in the Manuscript is of known origins. Hermeticism, Alchemy, Qabalah, Astrology and Tarot were certainly not unknown to 19th century scholars of the Magical arts; the Cipher is a compendium of previously known Magical traditions. The basic structure of the rituals and the names of the Grades are similar to those of the Rosicrucian orders Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and the German 'Orden der Gold- und Rosenkreuzer'. Claimed discovery William Wynn Westcott, a London Deputy Coroner, member of the S.R.I.A. and one of the founders of the Golden Dawn, claimed to have received the manuscripts through Rev. A. F. A. Woodford, who was a colleague of noted Masonic scholar Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie.F. King, 1989, page 42 The papers were to have been secured by Westcott after Mackenzie’s death in 1886, among the belongings of Mackenzie's mentor, the late Frederick Hockley,Van Den Broek (1997) and by September 1887, they were decoded by Westcott. The Manuscripts also contained an address of an aged adept named Fräulein (Miss) Anna Sprengel in Germany. According to Westcott, he wrote to Sprengel inquiring about the contents of the papers.F. King, 1989, page 43 Sprengel responded, and after accepting the requests of Westcott and his partner and fellow Mason Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, issued them a Charter to operate a Lodge of the Order in England. Westcott's first Golden Dawn temple was the Isis-Urania Temple, styled \\"No. 3.\\" Temple No. 1 would have been Fräulein Sprengel's lodge, and No. 2 was supposedly an abortive attempt at a lodge by some unnamed persons in London (possibly a reference to Mackenzie and other S.R.I.A. members some years earlier).Howe (1978) According to Ronald Decker and Michael Dummett, the page of the Cipher Manuscripts mentioning Anna Sprengel was almost certainly not part of the original. They argue that Westcott invented Sprengel in order to give the Golden Dawn a more plausible connection to ancient esoteric wisdom. Controversy Considerable controversy surrounds the origins of the Cipher Manuscripts. Westcott claimed Sprengel was a German Adept of the 'Gold- und Rosenkreuzer' Order who wrote letters to Westcott and Mathers granting them permission to establish the Order in England. Mathers later claimed that only the letters were forgeries, but it seems unlikely that Westcott or Mathers wrote the Manuscripts themselves, as some believe.Waite (2005) There is considerable doubt among scholars that Westcott's story is accurate. In particular, the age and contents of the documents have been the subject of much controversy. In particular, the manuscript contains a reference to the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead which was not understood by scholars before the deciphering of the Rosetta stone in 1822, and not published in translation until 1842.Machen (1923) Possible sources A variety of theories exist as to the real source of the Cipher Manuscript. Some of the more common ones include: * Westcott and Mathers created the Manuscripts and letters themselves,Tyson (1981) and created the origin myth of \\"Rosicrucian Adepts\\" to give credibility to their new Order.Hopking (2001) * Mason and clergyman A.F.A. Woodford found the Cipher Manuscript in a secondhand bookstall on Wellington Road in London, and gave it to his friend Westcott to be decoded.McIntosh (1998) * The Sprengel letters were a forgery by Westcott, but the Manuscripts were written by Kenneth Mackenzie and/or other scholars of the S.R.I.A. (to which Westcott, Mathers and Woodman belonged as early as 1881). Fräulein Sprengel was a legend invented by Westcott to give lineage to the newly formed order. Westcott created the mythology of the Cipher Manuscripts origins, knowing that a more esoteric source would carry weight with occultists of the era.Cicero (2003) * There was no German order; the first Golden Dawn temple was a project of a secret group within the S.R.I.A. called the \\"Society of Eight\\". (By the time Westcott \\"discovered\\" the Manuscripts, all the members of the Society were deceased.) Fräulein Sprengel didn't really exist, but the Manuscript itself has true antiquarian origins, traceable to Johann Falk and passed through the hands of Francis Barrett, Eliphas Levi, and eventually to Mackenzie, Woodford and the S.R.I.A. (and the Society of Eight). * There really was a German Rosicrucian order, sometimes referred to as the \\"Gold und Rosenkreutz,\\" and it already had a branch in London, founded around 1810. Mackenzie was a member of this German order, into which he had been initiated by Count Apponyi of Hungary, and obtained the rituals described in the Cipher from them.Wilson (1947) * The rituals in the Manuscripts were written by Baron Edward Bulwer- Lytton, honorary patron of the S.R.I.A. and author of an occult novel called Zanoni - A Strange Story, or by Frederick Hockley, the famous Rosicrucian seer and transcriber of occult manuscripts, and thence passed to Mackenzie. * The Cipher Manuscript was legitimate, and the Golden Dawn is a valid offspring of an older Jewish order in Bavaria called Loge zur aufgehenden Morgenröthe, which translates to \\"Lodge of the Approaching Morning Light\\" or \\"Lodge of the Rising Dawn\\". This Order was founded to allow German Jews to conduct Masonic- style lodges since, at the time, Jews were banned from participation in Freemasonry.Prinke (1985) In any case, no evidence has ever proven the existence of Fräulein Sprengel or her Lodge. (By Westcott's account, the other members of the German order supposedly objected to Sprengel's chartering of the Isis-Urania Lodge, and all further communications were cut off after she died.)Gilbert (1998) The Isis-Urania Charter was written and signed only by Westcott, Mathers and William Robert Woodman. There are letters by Mackenzie that indicate the 'Society of Eight' existed, but nothing that describes what they actually taught or practised. The symbolism and philosophy contained in the Cipher Manuscripts are not very different from that of high-degree Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, and Mackenzie and the members of the S.R.I.A. were capable-enough esoteric scholars, with access to works on the Qabalah, Hermeticism, and Egyptology in Masonic libraries, to have combined it all into the form followed by the Golden Dawn. However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove any of the proposed origins of the Cipher Manuscripts. Questions about the authenticity of the Manuscripts and the authority of the Isis-Urania Charter contributed to the first great schism of the Golden Dawn Order in 1900. In 1901, with the dissensions in the Golden Dawn, the poet W. B. Yeats, a member of the Order, privately published a pamphlet titled Is the Order of R.R. et A. C. to Remain a Magical Order?Melton, (2001) The true origins of the Cipher Manuscripts remain a mystery to this day.

It replaced the West New Guinea gulden at par and was replaced by the Indonesian rupiah at the rate of 1 West Irian rupiah = 18.9 Indonesian rupiah. History The presence of the Dutch in Netherlands New Guinea had been a subject of disagreement ever since the treaty that negotiated the Dutch withdrawal from Indonesia in 1949. The Dutch were unwilling to cede to Indonesian control, preferring instead to establish a state of Papua. The Indonesians eventually broke off diplomatic relations with the Dutch, on 17 August 1960. Due to the Indonesians insurgency and confusion over the status of the province, the UN took control as West New Guinea under the authority of the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority on 1 October 1962. On 1 May 1963, UNTEA agreed that the province would be transferred to Indonesia, as Irian Barat (West Irian), a province of Indonesia. By Presidential decree of Sukarno, on the day of May 1, 1963, the existing Netherlands New Guinean gulden was to be withdrawn, replaced at par, with government-issued coinage, government 1 and 2½ rupiah notes, with larger denomination notes to be issued by Bank Indonesia (the same division between government (aka treasury notes) and bank notes as existed for the Indonesian rupiah). Since the West Irian rupiah was replacing the gulden, which was a much stronger currency than the Indonesian rupiah, the Indonesian currency was not valid tender in Irian, in order to preserve the value of the Irian currency. Hyperinflation in Indonesia (which due to the separate monetary policy and currency, did not afflict Irian, although inflation was certainly still present) had necessitated a 1000 to 1 devaluation of the national currency in December 1965. It was the intention of the Presidential decree of 13 December 1965 that the 'rupiah baru' (new rupiah) become the unified national currency of all of Indonesia, exchangeable for the Irian Barat rupiah at par. However, a subsequent decree of 15 September 1966 restored the validity of the Irian money, recalling the Indonesian rupiah from Indonesia. The Indonesian rupiah only finally became legal tender in Irian on 18 February 1971. The existing Irian Barat money was exchangeable from May 1971 at the rate of 1 Irian Barat rupiah to 18.9 Indonesian rupiah. Thus given the official exchange rate of 378 Indonesian rupiah to 1 US$ at the time, it can be seen that the Irian Barat rupiah was ultimately worth exactly US$0.05. The Netherlands New Guinea gulden, fixed at par to the Dutch guilder, was exchangeable at 3.62 to the US dollar at the time of original conversion in 1963. Relative to the dollar therefore the currency had lost 82% of its value in 8 years. The Irian Barat rupiah circulated alongside the Indonesian rupiah as legal tender, for a further two years, until 1 April 1973. Coins Coins were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 sen. All were minted in aluminium and dated 1962. Unlike those issued for Riau (see Riau rupiah), they bore no edge inscription. Banknotes Bank Indonesia notes were printed by Indonesian printer P.N. Pertejetakan Kebajoran dated \\"1960\\" with the overprint \\"Irian Barat\\" in denominations of 5, 10, and 100 rupiah bearing the image of President Sukarno. The government notes were dated \\"1961\\" with the \\"Irian Barat\\" overprint in 1 and 2½ rupiah denominations. Near-identical, but for the overprint, versions of all five notes had previously been issued for the Riau rupiah, while the same five notes (minus the overprint) were also circulated as Indonesian rupiah in 1965 (with the 1 and 2½ rupiah notes alone redated, to \\"1964\\").

The ethnic roots of the Tunjur people are unknown. According to their oral traditions and some scholars, they are Arabs who migrated from the Arabian peninsula to Central Sudan either by way of North Africa and Tunis or by way of Nubia. In fact, as Gustav Nachtigal observed they resemble in features and behaviour the Arabs.Nachtigal/Fisher, Sahara, II, 257/ III, 13. Other scholars suggest that they have non-Muslim Nilotic roots, that is from the River Nile region. They were a minority, but became the ruling class of Darfur and Wadai in the 13th century by peacefully taking over power from the Daju. In 16th century, they were overthrown by an Arab group that founded the Keira dynasty, and later merged with the Fur people. According to the local legends of the Fur people, Shau Dorshid, the last ruler of the Tunjur, was “driven out by his own people because he compelled his subjects to dig wells in the high rocky regions and to undertake the ardeous and useless task of levelling the Mail mountain peak, on the summit of which he wanted to establish his residence\\" Nachtigal/Fisher, Sahara, III, 361/IV, 276. His capital is said to have been the site of Ain Farah. About the middle of the 17th century, the Tunjur people were expelled from the Islamic Wadai empire by Abd-el-Kerim of the Maba people, and the Mabas controlled the slave supply caravans to the north. The Tunjur people then migrated west into their current location. Thereafter, they converted to Maliki fiqh of Sunni Islam. Society They are farmers and live closely associated with the Fur. Their own Tunjur language is now extinct, and they now speak Arabic, Fur or Beri language as their first language. Contemporary issues Like the Fur and the Zaghawa, since the start of the Darfur conflict in February 2003, many Tunjur have been affected. A number of Tunjur have taken part in the fight against the Sudanese government, under the banners of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM). They are estimated around 176,000 people.

Before the Severn Bridge opened in 1966, it provided service for road traffic crossing between the West Country and South Wales. The nearest fixed crossing was a round trip to Gloucester. The ferry ran from a pier at Old Passage near the village of Aust on the east bank of the Severn. It ran to a similar pier on the east of the Beachley peninsula. The car ferry, set up in 1926, only carried cars, pedestrians and motorcycles; goods vehicles were prohibited from accessing the ferry terminal. History There has been a passage across the Severn at this location since Roman Britain. It has been recorded the site of the Trajectus (throwing-across) where the Roman legions used to be ferried across the Severn.Wilson, John, Imperial Gazetteer, 1870-72 It was recorded in the 12th century when the de Clares, lords of Tidenham, granted quittance of the passage to the monks of Tintern. It was evidently much used in 1405 when great numbers of the English and Welsh were said to resort to the nearby chapel of St. Twrog. The manor of Tidenham retained rights over the passage, and received rents from the parishes of Aust and Beachley, until the 19th century. The journey, a distance of over a mile at a point where the tides run swiftly, was a dangerous one, and its reputation, the roughness of the water, and the smallness of the boats deterred travellers. Daniel Defoe visited the crossing from the Aust side in the 18th century, but did not trust the ferry to survive the bad weather, and elected to go via Gloucester instead. By that time, ferry crossings from New Passage, between Redwick near Pilning and Sudbrook on the Welsh side, rivalled the Aust passage, which became known as the Old Passage.  Steam ferries: 1827–1860  In 1825 a new era opened with the formation of the Old Passage Ferry Association, sponsored by the Duke of Beaufort, as Lord of Tidenham. The company built stone piers on both banks, and commissioned a steamboat which began to ply in 1827, with a second one five years later, although sailing boats also continued to be used. By virtue of these improvements the company achieved the transfer of most of the cross- Severn mail routes from the rival New Passage. However, the passage remained dangerous. The Beachley-Aust ferry was lost with all hands on 1 September 1839. The same thing happened on 12 March 1844; the master, James Whitchurch was the son of the captain lost in 1839.1844 ferry loss In 1863, the railway reached the downstream, New Passage shores on both sides of the river, and this became the standard route. The Old Passage, not connected to the railway, therefore lost much of its traffic. The advent of railways, in particular the opening of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1864, the Severn Railway Bridge in 1879 and then the Severn Tunnel in 1886, brought a sharp decrease in traffic. Both the steamboats were scrapped by 1860 and eventually the service was closed altogether. Car ferry: 1926–1966 The ferry service gained a new lease of life, however, with the growth of motor traffic, and a service was re-opened in 1926. Between 1931 and 1966, a ferry service was operated by Enoch Williams of the Old Passage Severn Ferry Company Ltd.Jordan, Severn Enterprise Initially, this was only able to transport passengers with bicycles and motorbikes, but, by 1934, the Severn Queen was launched as a car ferry. It was able to carry just 17 cars. Each car had to turn sharply off the ramp onto the ferry, then be turned on a manually operated turntable before being parked. The process was reversed for unloading.Car ferry The ferry timetable was affected by the huge tidal range on the Severn and it was unable to operate at low tide or at very high tides. There was also a reported engine breakdown where the ferry took two hours to repair whilst drifting all the time down the Bristol Channel with the outward tide, and after the engine was repaired it took hours to return to Aust. The last ferry crossing occurred on 8 September 1966, the day before the first Severn Bridge opened.

MV Severn Princess restoration The last remaining ferry boat, the Severn Princess which was launched in 1959, was found wrecked, abandoned and full of fertiliser in Ireland in 1999 by Dr. Richard Jones, the grandson of Enoch Williams. As Galway County Council had put a demolition order on the vessel, a small group of Chepstow residents formed the Severn Princess Restoration Group with an urgent remit to save the Severn Princess and return her to the town. The derelict vessel was purchased for a token one guinea and temporary repair work started to get the vessel to a state where it could be towed back to South Wales. The Severn Princess returned to Beachley in 2003 following a five-day tow. For some years the vessel rested alongside the Beachley slipway, but was eventually moved to the west bank of the River Wye in Chepstow, to sit beneath the railway bridge. After some years of delay, during which the condition of the vessel deteriorated further, restoration finally started in 2014. The first stage of the restoration was made possible with the pledge and realisation of support from Chepstow-based steel bridging and infrastructure manufacturer Mabey Bridge Ltd which, as part of its Bridging Time community support programme, donated time, equipment and paint to enable the stabilisation of the vessel and arrest further deterioration. Mabey Bridge apprentices along with other employees of the company removed the turntable, winch and wheel capstan from the ferry and relocated them to the Mabey Bridge manufacturing facility for refurbishment. The majority of spray guards were similarly removed and relocated. However, some have been left as a template for future rebuilding. Holes were also drilled in the lower hull to drain the ferry of rainwater and Mabey Bridge staff secured the cabins. The winch chain hull tears were sent to be plated. This first phase of restoration was completed Thursday 11 September 2014 and commemorated with a handover ceremony attended by the Mayor of Chepstow Cllr Ned Heywood, members of the Severn Princess Restoration Group, and management and apprentices from Mabey Bridge Ltd. The long term aim of the Severn Princess Restoration Group is to return the vessel to a state where it can sit as a permanent heritage display at the site. The group has begun the process of clearing the area under the Brunel (tubular) railway bridge to make the site more attractive to visitors and users of the Wales Coast Path, which runs through Chepstow.

This modification allows secondary reactions of this functional group that would otherwise not be possible. The concept was introduced by D. Seebach (hence the German word umpolung for reversed polarity) and E.J. Corey. Polarity analysis during retrosynthetic analysis tells a chemist when umpolung tactics are required to synthesize a target molecule. Introduction The vast majority of important organic molecules contain heteroatoms, which polarize carbon skeletons by virtue of their electronegativity. Therefore, in standard organic reactions, the majority of new bonds are formed between atoms of opposite polarity. This can be considered to be the \\"normal\\" mode of reactivity. One consequence of this natural polarization of molecules is that 1,3- and 1,5- heteroatom substituted carbon skeletons are extremely easy to synthesize (Aldol reaction, Claisen condensation, Michael reaction, Claisen rearrangement, Diels-Alder reaction), whereas 1,2-, 1,4-, and 1,6- heteroatom substitution patterns are more difficult to access via \\"normal\\" reactivity. It is therefore important to understand and develop methods to induce umpolung in organic reactions. Examples The simplest method of obtaining 1,2-, 1,4-, and 1,6- heteroatom substitution patterns is to start with them. Biochemical and industrial processes can provide inexpensive sources of chemicals that have normally inaccessible substitution patterns. For example, amino acids, oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, tartaric acid, and glucose are abundant and provide nonroutine substitution patterns. Cyanide-type umpolung The canonical umpolung reagent is the cyanide ion. The cyanide ion is unusual in that a carbon triply bonded to a nitrogen would be expected to have a (+) polarity due to the higher electronegativity of the nitrogen atom. Yet, the negative charge of the cyanide ion is localized on the carbon, giving it a (-) formal charge. This chemical ambivalence results in umpolung in many reactions where cyanide is involved. For example, cyanide is a key catalyst in the benzoin condensation, a classical example of polarity inversion. Mechanism of the benzoin condensation The net result of the benzoin reaction is that a bond has been formed between two carbons that are normally electrophiles. =N-heterocyclic carbenes= left N-heterocyclic carbenes, or NHCs, are similar to cyanide in reactivity. Like cyanide, NHCs have an unusual chemical ambivalence, which allows it to trigger umpolung in reactions where it is involved. The carbene has six electrons - two each in the carbon-nitrogen single bonds, two in its sp2-hybridized orbital, and an empty p-orbital. The sp2 lone pair acts as an electron donor, whereas the empty p-orbital is capable as acting as an electron acceptor. In this example, the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester 1 formally acts as a nucleophile, whereas normally it would be expected to be a Michael acceptor. Scheme 3. Umpolung of Michael Acceptors This carbene reacts with the α,β-unsaturated ester 1 at the β-position forming the intermediate enolate 2. Through tautomerization 2b can displace the terminal bromine atom to 3. An elimination reaction regenerates the carbene and releases the product 4. For comparison: in the Baylis-Hillman reaction the same electrophilic β-carbon atom is attacked by a reagent but resulting in the activation of the α-position of the enone as the nucleophile. =Thiamine pyrophosphate= The human body can employ cyanide-like umpolung reactivity without having to rely on the toxic cyanide ion. Thiamine (which itself is an N-heterocyclic carbene) pyrophosphate (TPP) serves a functionally identical role. The thiazolium ring in TPP is deprotonated within the hydrophobic core of the enzyme, resulting in a carbene which is capable of umpolung. Deprotonation of thiazole moiety in thiamine pyrophosphate results in ambivalent chemical reactivity Enzymes which use TPP as a cofactor can catalyze umpolung reactivity, such as the decarboxylation of pyruvate. Mechanism of pyruvate decarboxylation In the absence of TPP, the decarboxylation of pyruvate would result in the placement of a negative charge on the carbonyl carbon, which would run counter to the normal polarization of the carbon-oxygen double bond. 3-membered rings Opening of ethylene oxide with hydroxide 3-membered rings are strained moieties in organic chemistry. When a 3-membered ring contains a heteroatom, such as in an epoxide or in a bromonium intermediate, the three atoms in the ring become polarized. It is impossible to assign (+) and (-) polarities to a 3-membered ring without having two adjacent atoms with the same polarity. Therefore, whenever a polarized 3-membered ring is opened by a nucleophile, umpolung inevitably results . For example, the opening of ethylene oxide with hydroxide leads to ethylene glycol. Carbonyl umpolung / anion relay chemistry Dithiane chemistry is a classic example of polarity inversion. Ordinarily the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group is more electronegative than the carbon atom and therefore the carbonyl group reacts as an electrophile at carbon. This polarity can be reversed when the carbonyl group is converted into a dithiane or a thioacetal. In synthon terminology the ordinary carbonyl group is an acyl cation and the dithiane is a masked acyl anion. When the dithiane is derived from an aldehyde such as acetaldehyde the acyl proton can be abstracted by n-butyllithium in THF at low temperatures. The thus generated 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane reacts as a nucleophile in nucleophilic displacement with alkyl halides such as benzyl bromide, with other carbonyl compounds such as cyclohexanone or oxiranes such as phenyl-epoxyethane, shown below. After hydrolysis of the dithiane group the final reaction products are α-alkyl- ketones or α-hydroxy-ketones. A common reagent for dithiane hydrolysis is (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene. Scheme 1. Dithiane chemistry Dithiane chemistry opens the way to many new chemical transformations. One example is found in so-called anion relay chemistry in which a negative charge of an anionic functional group resulting from one organic reaction is transferred to a different location within the same carbon framework and available for secondary reaction. In this example of a multi-component reaction both formaldehyde (1) and isopropylaldehyde (8) are converted into dithianes 3 and 9 with 1,3-propanedithiol. Sulfide 3 is first silylated by reaction with tert- butyllithium and then trimethylsilyl chloride 4 and then the second acyl proton is removed and reacted with optically active (−)-epichlorohydrin 6 replacing chlorine. This compound serves as the substrate for reaction with the other dithiane 9 to the oxirane ring opening product 10. Under influence of the polar base HMPA, 10 rearranges in a 1,4-Brook rearrangement to the silyl ether 11 reactivating the formaldehyde dithiane group as an anion (hence the anion relay concept). This dithiane group reacts with oxirane 12 to the alcohol 13 and in the final step the sulfide groups are removed with (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene. Scheme 2. Anion relay chemistry, Ph stands for phenyl The anion relay chemistry tactic has been applied elegantly in the total synthesis of complex molecules of significant biological activity, such as spongistatin 2 and mandelalide A. Oxidative bond formation It is possible to form a bond between two carbons of (-) polarity by using an oxidant such as iodine. In this total synthesis of enterolactone, the 1,4- relationship of oxygen substituents is assembled by the oxidative homocoupling of a carboxylate enolate using iodine as the oxidant. Total synthesis of enterolactone Amine umpolung Ordinarily the nitrogen atom in the amine group is reacting as a nucleophile by way of its lone pair. This polarity can be reversed when a primary or secondary amine is substituted with a good leaving group (such as a halogen atom or an alkoxy group). The resulting N-substituted compound can behave as an electrophile at the nitrogen atom and react with a nucleophile as for example in the electrophilic amination of carbanions.

Byzantine medicine was notable for building upon the knowledge base developed by its Greco-Roman predecessors. In preserving medical practices from antiquity, Byzantine medicine influenced Islamic medicine as well as fostering the Western rebirth of medicine during the Renaissance. Byzantine physicians often compiled and standardized medical knowledge into textbooks. Their records tended to include both diagnostic explanations and technical drawings. The Medical Compendium in Seven Books, written by the leading physician Paul of Aegina, survived as a particularly thorough source of medical knowledge. This compendium, written in the late seventh century, remained in use as a standard textbook for the following 800 years. This tradition of compilation continued from around the tenth century into the twentieth through the genre of medical writings known as iatrosophia. Late antiquity ushered in a revolution in medical science, and historical records often mention civilian hospitals (although battlefield medicine and wartime triage were recorded well before Imperial Rome). Constantinople stood out as a center of medicine during the Middle Ages, which was aided by its crossroads location, wealth, and accumulated knowledge.  Background  Arguably, the first Byzantine physician was the author of the Vienna Dioscurides manuscript, created circa 515 AD for the daughter of Emperor Olybrius. Like most Byzantine physicians, this author drew his material from ancient authorities like Galen and Hippocrates, though Byzantine doctors expanded upon the knowledge preserved from Greek and Roman sources. Oribasius, arguably the most prolific Byzantine compiler of medical knowledge, frequently made note of standing medical assumptions that were proved incorrect. Several of his works, along with those of other Byzantine physicians, were translated into Latin, and eventually, during the Enlightenment and Age of Reason, into English and French. Another Byzantine treatise, that of the thirteenth century doctor Nicholas Myrepsos, remained the principal pharmaceutical code of the Parisian medical faculty until 1651, while the Byzantine tract of Demetrios Pepagomenos (thirteenth century) on gout was translated and published in Latin by the post-Byzantine humanist Marcus Musurus, in Venice in 1517. Therefore, it could be argued that previous misrepresentations about Byzantium being simply a 'carrier' of Ancient Medical knowledge to the Renaissance are wrong. It is known, for example, that the late twelfth-century Italian physician (Roger of Salerno) was influenced by the treatises of the Byzantine doctors Aëtius and Alexander of Tralles as well as Paul of Aegina. The last great Byzantine physician was John Actuarius, who lived in the early 14th Century in Constantinople. His works on urine laid much of the foundation for later study in urology. However, from the latter 12th Century to the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, there was very little further dissemination of medical knowledge, largely due to the turmoil the Empire was facing on both fronts, following its resurrection after the Latin Empire and the dwindling population of Constantinople due to plague and war. Nevertheless, Byzantine medicine is extremely important both in terms of new discoveries made in that period (at a time when Western Europe was in turmoil), the collection of ancient Greek and Roman knowledge, and its dissemination to both Renaissance Italy and the Islamic world.  Hospitals  The Byzantine Empire was one of the first empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had hospitals specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth. The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled the beginning of what we now know as modern hospitals. The first hospital was erected by Leontius of Antioch between the years 344 to 358 and was a place for strangers and migrants to find refuge. Around the same time, a deacon named Marathonius was in charge of hospitals and monasteries in Constantinople. His main objective was to improve urban aesthetics, illustrating hospitals as a main part of Byzantine cities. These early hospitals were designed for the poor. In fact, most hospitals throughout the Byzantine Empire were almost exclusively utilized by the poor. This may be due to descriptions of hospitals similar to \\"Gregory Nazianzen who called the hospital a stairway to heaven, implying that it aimed only to ease death for the chronically or terminally ill rather than promote recovery\\". There is debate between scholars as to why these institutions were started by the church. Whatever the case for these hospitals, they began to diffuse across the empire. Soon after, St. Basil of Caesarea developed a place for the sick in which provided refuge for the sick and homeless. Following the influx in hospitals during the mid to late fourth century, hospitals diffused across the empire. By the beginning of the fifth century hospitals had spread across the Mediterranean to Ostia, Rome and Hippo. However, these hospitals did not spark a proliferation of more hospitals in Byzantine Africa and Italy. Also in the fifth century, there is evidence of hospitals sprouting up in Byzantine Egypt and Syria. In Syria, the hospital described in The Life of Rabbula of Edessa documents providing clean clothes and sheets for its inhabitants. Additionally, Bishop Rabbula and the hospital in Edessa is known as the first hospital for the sick as well as the poor. After the sixth century, hospitals were not as rampantly created. Instead they were now a normal part of civic life. Evidence of construction of new hospitals originates from the Chronographia by Michael Psellos. In his book, he describes emperors Basil I, Romanos I Lekapenos, and Constantine IX building new hospitals, all of which were located in Constantinople. Outside of Constantinople, there is evidence of a hospital in Thessalonica that along with providing beds and shelter for its patients also distributed medicine to walk-in patients in the twelfth century. The 5th century Byzantine manuscript now known as the Vienna Dioscorides was still being used as a hospital textbook in Constantinople nearly a thousand years after it was created in that city; marginalia in the manuscript record that it was ordered to be rebound by a Greek nurse named Nathaniel in 1406.Mazal, Otto. \\"Der Wiener Dioscurides\\" vol. 1, p. 16 Throughout the Middle Ages the actual number of hospitals in the empire is difficult to track. Some experts estimate over 160 hospitals. These hospitals varied tremendously in size. The large hospitals, such as the one in Constantinople, was estimated to have over two-hundred beds. Yet most other hospitals from this time seem to only more likely have numbers of beds in the tens of people.  Practices  The medical practices of the Byzantine Empire originated from the Greek physician Hippocrates and Roman ethnic Greek Citizen Physician Galen. Evidence of the use of ancient Greek medicinal ideas is seen through Byzantine physician's reliance on humors to diagnose illness. Byzantine physicians followed the Hippocratic Theory that the body consisted of four humors, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These humors were connected to particular seasons, hot or cold and dry or moist. In order to identifying these humors Byzantine physicians relied heavily on Galen's works. Byzantine diagnostic techniques centered around physician's observations of patient's pulses and urine. Also, with certain diseases, physicians may have examined excrement, breathing rate, and speech production. In the field of pulses, physicians followed the teachings of Galen, identifying pulse according to size, strength, speed, frequency of a series, and hardness or softness. The Byzantine physician John Zacharias Aktouarios states that a physician needs an exceptionally sensitive hand and a clear mind. John Zacharias Aktouarios also had a large impact in the field of urology. In Byzantine diagnostics urine was used to identify different types of illness. John Zacharias Aktouarios created a vial that separated urine into eleven different sections. The section in which the sediments or different colors appeared in the vial correlated to a different body part. For instance, if there were clouds on top of the vial this was thought to represent infections of the head. After diagnosing the type of humor through pulse or urinary observations, physicians would then try to expunge the humor through by prescribing dietary changes, medicine, or bloodletting. Another way that people was treated was through surgery. Paul of Aegina was on the forefront of surgery. He describes the operation to fix a hernia writing, \\"After making the incision to the extent of three fingers' breadth transversely across the tumor to the groin, and removing the membranes and fat, and the peritoneum being exposed in the middle where it is raised up to a point, let the knob of the probe be applied by which the intestines will be pressed deep down. The prominence, then, of the peritoneum, formed on each side of the knob of the probe, are to be joined together by sutures, and then we extract the probe, neither cutting the peritoneum nor removing the testicle, nor anything else, but curing it with applications used for fresh wounds.\\" Other types of surgery occurred during this time and were described in Paul of Aegina's work, Epitome of Medicine. This work references over forty types of surgery and around fifteen surgical instruments. Additionally, there is evident of people being hired to keep the surgical instruments clean called \\"akonetes\\". This exhibits the attention to surgery that Byzantine hospitals had. In addition to surgery, pharmaceuticals were also a common way to cure sickness. Alexander of Tralles wrote of over six hundred drugs that he used to try and cure illnesses. His Twelve Books exemplify the use of medicine to treat all types of diseases, including what he described as \\"melancholy\\" which modern doctors would describe as depression. Some of these pharmaceuticals are still used today such as colchicine. Alexander of Tralles was one of the most important physicians of Byzantium and exemplified how medicine had a large impact on Byzantine life. The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s. One of the conjoined twins had already died, so surgeons attempted to separate the dead twin from the surviving twin. The result was partly successful as the remaining twin lived for three days after separation. The next case of separating conjoined twins was recorded in 1689 in Germany several centuries later.  Christianity  Christianity played a key role in the building and maintaining of hospitals. Many hospitals were built and maintained by bishops in their respective prefectures. Hospitals were usually built near or around churches, and great importance was laid on the idea of healing through salvation. When medicine failed, doctors would ask their patients to pray. This often involved icons of Cosmas and Damian, patron saints of medicine and doctors. Christianity also played a key role in propagating the idea of charity. Medicine was made, according to Oregon State University historian, Gary Ferngren (professor of ancient Greek and Rome history with a speciality in ancient medicine) \\"accessible to all and... simple\\". In the actual practice of medicine there is evidence of Christian influence. John Zacharias Aktouarios recommends the use of Holy Water mixed with a pellitory plant to act as a way to cure epilepsy.

Blue Security maintained these addresses in a hashed form in a Do Not Intrude Registry, and spammers could use free tools to clean their lists. The tool was discontinued in . Information Community members reported their spam to Blue Security, which analyzed it to make sure it met their guidelines, then reported sites sending illegal spam to the ISPs which hosted them (if they could be contacted and were willing to work with them), to other anti-spam groups and to law-enforcement authorities in an attempt to get the spammer to cease and desist. If these measures failed, Blue Security sent back a set of instructions to a Blue Frog client. The client software used these instructions to visit and leave complaints on the websites advertised by the spam messages. For each spam message a user received, their Blue Frog client would leave one generic complaint, including instructions on how to remove all Blue Security users from future mailings. Blue Security operated on the assumption that as the community grew, the flow of complaints from tens or hundreds of thousands of computers would apply enough pressure on spammers and their clients to convince them to stop spamming members of the Blue Security community. The Blue Frog software included a Firefox and Internet Explorer plugin allowing Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo! Mail e-mail users to report their spam automatically. Users could also report spam from desktop email applications such as Microsoft Office Outlook, Outlook Express and Mozilla Thunderbird. Users who downloaded the free Blue Frog software registered their e-mail addresses in the \\"Do Not Intrude\\" registry. Each user could protect ten addresses and one personal DNS domain name. Blue Frog was available as a free add-on within the Firetrust Mailwasher anti-spam filter. It was also compatible with SpamCop, a tool with different spam-fighting methods. Blue Security released all its software products (including Blue Frog) as open- source: the developer community could review, modify, or enhance them. Spammers' backlash A variation of the hoax messages. On May 1, 2006, Blue Frog members started to receive intimidating e-mail messages from sources claiming that the software was actually collecting personal details for identity theft, DDoS attacks, creating a spam database, and other such purposes. Blue Security has contested these claims.. One variant of the e-mailed message stated that spammers had found a way to extract addresses from the database for malicious purposes. Due to how the Blue Security software works, this is not possible; however, spammers can identify BlueFrog member e-mail addresses in lists they already possess. Blue Security provides spammers a free tool that allows them to \\"clean their lists\\". Extracting addresses directly from the program would be impossible as they are just hashes, but a spammer can run a list through the BlueSecurity filter and then compare the results with an unaltered list, and thus identify BlueSecurity users and target them. This method can only identify Blue Frog addresses already in the spammer's possession, and cannot give them access to as-yet- untargeted addresses. Controversy In May 2006, the Blue Security company was subject to a retaliatory DDoS attack initiated by spammers. As its servers folded under the load, Blue Security redirected its own DNS entries to point to the company weblog, which was announcing its difficulty. The company weblog was hosted at the blogs.com webportal, a subsidiary of Six Apart. This effectively redirected the attack to blogs.com and caused Six Apart's server farm to collapse, which in turn is said to have made some 2,000 other blogs unreachable for several hours. Individuals claiming to be members of the computer security establishment condemned the Blue Security company for the action it took while under DDoS attack. A representative of Renesys likened this action to pushing a burning couch from their house to a neighbor's. In its defense, Blue Security Inc. stated that it was not aware of the DDoS attack when it made the DNS change, claiming to have been \\"blackholed\\" (or isolated) in its Israeli network as a result of a social engineering hack, which was alleged to have been pulled off by one of the attackers against a high-tier ISP's tech support staff. This claim has been disputed by many writers such as Todd Underwood, writer of Renesys blog. Most sources, however, agree that regardless of whether Blue Security were \\"blackholed\\", they seem not to have been facing attack at the time they redirected their web address. Blue Security also claimed to have remained on amicable terms with Six Apart and pointed to the fact that the blog hosting company did not blame or even name them in the press release which explained the service outage.. In any event, the action was widely reported on IT security websites, possibly damaging Blue Security's reputation within that community. At the same time, the incident and its broad reporting in more general-interest media was considered by many to be a boon to the notoriety of Blue Security and the Blue Frog project. Security expert Brian Krebs gives a different reason for Blue Security's website being unavailable in his article for The Washington Post. He says that what happened was not that Blue Security was lying about being unable to receive HTTP requests (because their servers were down), saying they had been \\"black hole filtered\\" and maliciously re-directed traffic, but rather that they were actually unable to receive traffic due to an attack on their DNS servers. This makes it probable that they had essentially been telling the truth and that CEO Eran Reshef was simply misinformed as to why their users were unable to reach their site. =Accusations of being malware= Some users accused Blue Frog of being malware itself on Mozilla's chat forums, claiming that Blue Frog spammed signatures in Yahoo! and Gmail accounts, left active remnants all over the operating system after uninstalling, and hinted that the actual reason for Blue Frog's existence in accumulating a \\"do-not- spam\\" database was to harvest fresh addresses for spammers to deluge. Blue Frog shut down one week after the forum thread appeared. After Blue Security recast itself as Collactive, it would again be accused of spamming. Attackers identified Soon after the attack started, Blue Security CEO Eran Reshef claimed to have identified the attacker as PharmaMaster, and quoted him as writing \\"Blue found the right solution to stop spam, and I can't let this continue\\" in an ICQ conversation with Blue Security. Prime suspects for the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on Blue Security's servers have been identified in the ROKSO database as Christopher Brown, AKA Swank AKA \\"Dollar\\". and his partner Joshua Burch AKA \\"zMACk\\". Unidentified Australians and \\"some Russians\\" (Russian/Americans), notably Leo Kuvayev. and Alex Blood,. were also involved. The suspects were identified from a transcript of their postings. in the Special ham forum where both the spam attacks and DDoS attack were planned.  Shutdown of service  Blue Security ceased operation on May 16, 2006. The company announced it will look for non-spam related uses of its technology. The company's investors expressed full support for the company's decision to change its business plan. Many users have suggested continuing the project's goals in a decentralized manner (specifically using peer-to-peer technology, with the client distributed via BitTorrent or similar, thus making both the spam processing and client distribution elements harder for the spammers to attack). One such program was purportedly begun under the name Okopipi. though this now appears to have been abandoned. A number of users have recommended all users to uninstall the Blue Frog program, as it is no longer useful without the Blue Security servers active..  Complainterator  One of the former Blue Security members, Red Dwarf, wrote a program called Complainterator.. It runs on Windows and as an add-on to several popular email clients. It processes spam emails and produces email messages to be sent to sites hosting spamvertised products. The goal is to inform hosting sites in hopes that they will remove spam sites, thereby making it difficult for spammers to profit from spam activities.

It is one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon churches in England and one of only three complete Anglo-Saxon churches remaining in England, the others being St Lawrence's Church, Bradford-on-Avon and All Saints' Church, Brixworth. The church is a Grade I listed building. Architecture=Anglo-Saxon The church was founded about AD 670–675, when the area was part of the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. Much of the stone was taken from the nearby Roman fort at Vinovia (Binchester). On the gable of the south porch is a 7th or early 8th Century sundial, and on the north wall is a reused Roman stone with the markings \\"LEG VI\\" (Sixth Legion) set upside down. Above the sundial projects an Anglo-Saxon relief of an animal's head. Because Bede (circa AD 673–735) did not mention the church, some have argued that it was not built until after his death. However, he only named churches which were associated with events he recorded. The proportions of the nave are typically Anglo-Saxon: narrow and tall. The chancel is rectangular. The church is built of large roughly dressed, squared stones, with particularly large quoins, many of which are up to high and between and long. The early character of the building and its similarity to other early work in Northumbria are consistent with it having been built between AD 650 and 800. Internally the nave is long by wide. Its walls are thick and about high. The chancel is square. The chancel arch is wide and its apex is above the floor of the nave. The chancel arch, with traces of what may be Mediæval paint Internally the most notable feature is the tall, narrow chancel arch. The southern impost of the arch is reminiscent of those in a gateway of the Roman fort at Chesters on Hadrian's Wall. This strengthens the theory that stones used at Escomb were brought from Binchester. Many of the stones show Roman tooling, which is common in Anglo-Saxon churches. The chancel arch is of typical Roman form, tall with massive stone jambs, simple chamfered imposts and precisely-cut, radial voussoirs. It is unlike the non-radial voussoirs that the Anglo-Saxons typically made. Anglo-Saxon altar cross In the restoration of 1880 were found a number of delicately carved fragments of cross-shafts of the high quality commonly assigned to the Hexham school. They were found built into the gables, presumably during earlier restorations. Gothic and later Sundial on the 14th-century south porch At an unknown date the eaves were raised. The nave now has a crow-stepped gable at each end. Some simple Gothic windows were inserted in the 13th century and the south porch was built in the 14th century. In the 19th century more windows were inserted and a new door was installed in the porch. But the majority of the windows, small and set high in the walls, are original Anglo-Saxon work. The church is essentially little changed from when it was built. Neglect and restorations Until the 19th century Escomb was a dependent chapelry of Bishop Auckland. In 1848 a vicarage was built at the top of the hill and Rev. Henry Atkinson became Escomb's first resident vicar for centuries. The Anglo- Saxon church seated only 65 people, and in the 19th century Escomb's population outgrew it. In 1863 a new parish church, St John's, was completed next to the vicarage. Thereafter the Anglo-Saxon church quickly fell into disrepair. By 1867 it had lost part of its roof. It was restored in 1875–80 by RJ Johnson at a cost of between £500 and £550. In October 1880 Joseph Lightfoot, Bishop of Durham, came and preached at a service to mark the completion of the restoration. But the building had no heating or artificial light, and thereafter was used for only a few services a year, from June until August. By 1904 the roof was again in poor condition. In the 1920s the parish again raised money to restore the church, and on 1 June 1927 Handley Moule, Bishop of Durham presided at the Eucharist in the church to mark completion of the work. The first surviving record of a proposal to install electric lighting in the church dates from 1940. In 1944 it was proposed again, along with gas heating. But the Diocesan Advisory Committee objected and the Diocese of Durham did not grant a faculty for the work. Heating and lighting were discussed again in 1950, but not installed. In 1959 a new vicar, Rev. Henry Lee, was appointed to the parish. In 1960 the parish agreed to refurbish the building and Lee resumed summer services in it. The architect Sir Albert Richardson prepared plans and in 1962 both the parish and the diocese accepted them. 1960s altar in the chancel The plan was now for electric lighting and heating to be installed, along with a new altar and other furnishings. The cost of restoration and modernisation was estimated at £6,500. Historic Churches Preservation Trust donated £500 to the fund. In 1963 St John's church, completed only a century earlier, was inspected and found to need repairs estimated to cost £6,500. But church attendance had declined, so the Diocesan Pastoral Committee decided that restoring both of Escomb's churches was not justified. It decided that the Anglo-Saxon church should once again be the parish church, and St John's should be deconsecrated and demolished. Lee refused the proposal, but in 1964 he retired and the diocese suspended the living and the rural dean was made priest in charge. In 1967 restoration of the Anglo-Saxon church was begun, in December 1969 it reverted to being the parish church, and in 1971 St John's was demolished.

It was the first Daimler car to be based on a Jaguar platform, the first with a unit body, and the last to feature a Daimler engine after the company was bought from the Birmingham Small Arms Company by Jaguar Cars in 1960. The engine is the hemispherical head V8 designed by Edward Turner and first used in the Daimler SP250 sports car. Background and development Daimler had entered the medium-sized saloon market in 1932 with the Daimler Fifteen but left the market with the end of production of the Conquest in 1957. Attempts to re- enter the market with Turner's 2.5-litre V8 included development of the DN250 based on the Vauxhall Cresta PA's unibody, which was discontinued before Jaguar's purchase of Daimler, and the DP250 two-door saloon based on the SP250, which was discontinued by Jaguar after it bought Daimler. Despite claiming interest in expanding Daimler's markets, Jaguar had bought Daimler primarily to expand their production facilities and, apart from replacing the DK400B limousine with the Majestic Major-based DR450, Jaguar had done little to develop new Daimler models.Jaguar had, however, developed existing Daimler models, especially the SP250 sports car. Stratstone Ltd., Daimler dealers since their founding in 1921 as Stratton-Instone by former Daimler executives, pressed Jaguar to develop a medium-sized saloon to replace the Conquest, which Jaguar agreed to do in exchange for Stratstone dropping their Volkswagen franchise. Daimler's development of the 2.5-litre saloon was initially given few resources; the first prototype was based on an old Jaguar Mark 1 unibody that had been abandoned outside one of the factory buildings after having been modified for suspension experiments. Once the concept had been proven, a new prototype based on a Mark 2 body shell was built The Daimler V8 engine was more compact and lighter than the Jaguar XK6 engine used in the Mark 2, and weighed approximately less. Spring and damper settings were revised accordingly to suit the altered weight distribution. The engine sump had to be redesigned to fit between the Mark 2's front suspension units and around one of its crossmembers, new exhaust manifolds were designed to fit in the engine bay, the water pump and cooling fan were relocated, and different air filters were used. The cylinder head fasteners were changed from studs to set bolts to allow the heads to be removed while the engine was still in the car. The radiator fan was driven through a viscous coupling unit that slipped progressively with increased engine speed, which reduced noise from the fan. The Daimler's Borg-Warner Type 35 automatic transmission was smaller and lighter than the units used on the Mark 2 and had strong engine braking in each gear range. As a result of being built with the unit body of the Jaguar Mark 2, the 2.5-litre saloon became the first Daimler motor car without a separate frame.The Lanchester Sprite had been designed in the 1950s with a unit body, but did not reach series production and only thirteen were built. Daimler 2.5 V8 Fluted or \\"furrowed brow\\" grille on a 1967 2.5 V8 The Daimler 2.5 V8 (or 2½-litre V8) was a four-door saloon produced in Coventry, England by Daimler. Launched late in 1962.Jaguar's Clothing For A Daimler Top Speed Of 112 M.P.H. From our motoring correspondent. The Times, Monday, Oct 08, 1962; pg. 7; Issue 55516; col C It was essentially a rebadged Jaguar Mark 2 fitted with Daimler's 2.5-litre V8 engine and drive-train, a Daimler fluted grille and rear number plate surround, distinctive wheel trims, badges, and interior details including a split-bench front seat from the Jaguar Mark 1 and a black enamel steering wheel. Special interior and exterior colours were specified. Most cars were fitted with power-assisted steering but it was optional. Automatic transmission was standard; manual, with or without overdrive, became an option in 1967. The 2.5 V8 was the first Jaguar designed car to have the Daimler badge. A casual observer, though not its driver, might mistake it for a Jaguar Mark 2. The Daimler's stance on the road was noticeably different from a Mark 2. In April 1964 the Borg-Warner Type 35 automatic transmission was replaced by a D1/D2 type, also by Borg-Warner. Three years after its launch, a Daimler 2½-litre saloon with automatic transmission tested by Britain's Autocar magazine in May 1966 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 13.6 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of was achieved. The test car was priced in the UK at £1,647 including taxes: Rover's 3-litre with automatic transmission was retailing for £1,770. At the end of 1965, the final drive ratio had been changed from 4.55:1 to 4.27:1, addressing complaints that the car as launched in 1963 had needed to exceed its recommended rev limit in order to reach its top speed, with a corresponding penalty in fuel consumption and engine noise and wear. The testers found the car refined and well equipped with efficient, if rather heavy, brakes. The engine and transmission were felt to be well matched. The car was quiet and smooth but with poor low speed torque. A manual transmission, with or without an overdrive unit usable with the top gear, became available on British 2.5 V8 saloon in February 1967 and on export versions the following month. Cars optioned with the overdrive had the original 4.55:1 final drive ratio Daimler V8-250 V8-250 Produced from October 1967 to 1969, the V8-250 was a minor face-lift and re-naming of the 2.5 V8 saloon and differed in relatively small details: \\"slimline\\" bumpers and over-riders (shared with the Jaguar 240/340 relabelled at the same time), negative-earth electrical system, an alternator instead of a dynamo and twin air cleaners, one for each carburettor. Other new features included padding over the instrument panel, padded door cappings and ventilated leather upholstery, reclinable split-bench front seats and a heated rear window.Restyled Daimler on show. The Times, Thursday, Oct 05, 1967; pg. 4; Issue 57064 Power steering and overdrive were optional extras. Market placement Daimler 2.5 V8 (North America) Aside from the smoother and more powerful engine and a number of external markers the Daimler V8-250 was simply a more luxuriously finished Jaguar 240. The 250's place in the Jaguar range was always ill-defined. Whilst historically Daimler had been a genuine luxury and super-luxury brand the 250, though far better equipped than the base-model Jaguar 240, lacked some interior appointments found on the 340. The Daimler 250's engine, being a V8 (in its home market a prestige feature), producing —in between the outputs of the 2.4- and 3.4-litre six-cylinder engines. The V8-250 was a car with a high prestige badge sitting in the middle of its parent-company's range. End of production Jaguar replaced its range of saloons—the 240, the 340, the 420, and the 420G—with the XJ6 at the end of 1968. The company launched the XJ6-based Daimler Sovereign the following year to replace the Daimler saloons—the 240-based V8-250 and the 420-based Sovereign. Henceforth all new Daimlers would be re-badged Jaguars with no engineering links to the pre-1960 Daimlers.

In it, Mohr recounts, among other things, his battles with panic attacks, being intimidated by castmates Rob Schneider and Ellen Cleghorne, his conflicts with Al Franken, his admiration for deceased castmates Chris Farley and Phil Hartman, the admission that he stole material from actor/comedian Rick Shapiro, and being depressed about his lack of sketch appearances. Former SNL castmember Bobby Moynihan has said that it was one of his favorite SNL related books, calling it \\"a handbook on what NOT to do at SNL.\\"http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/02/26/snl_s_bobby_moynihan_discusses_working_w?page=2  Critical reception  Booklist called it \\"Good insider dish\\": \\"Mohr chronicles those years with the sly wit he's become known for, as well as nostalgia for both the time he had and the kid he was. That's not to say things went well. He barely got any sketches on air, his dressing room was once an elevator shaft, and he suffered panic attacks so severe he thought he would die on camera. But he also met some encouraging people (Mike McKeon) [sic] and was able to spend a little time hanging out with various luminaries (Eric Clapton), so even though he moans and whines about what he endured on the show, he ends up describing the experience as glorious.\\" Publishers Weekly, on the other hand, found \\"this stilted but honest memoir\\" to serve only \\"mostly superficial dish\\": \\"Few of his sketches aired, and aside from his impressions of Ricki Lake, Christopher Walken and Dick Vitale, he was rarely on camera. (When he was on air, he admits, he often couldn't keep a straight face.) Mohr treats readers to some affectionate, entertaining tales of the late Chris Farley, but his book is less a juicy inside story of the comedy institution than a tale of an immature young man's struggle with a high- stress, erratic workplace: 'The schedule for putting together Saturday Night Live was made back in the seventies when everyone was on coke.... Problem was, no one did coke [anymore] and we were expected to keep the same hours.'\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"Mohr is unafraid to come off as nervous and a little grating: the whole first season he's just the new guy nobody will look in the eye, whose ideas get shot down, who's always asking dumb questions and almost never gets on the air. Though tinged with bitterness (after two seasons, Mohr was basically known only for his Christopher Walken impersonation), this account is generous in its praise for people like Phil Hartman, Chris Farley, and Michael McKean. Profiles of other costars--like David Spade, who \\"was only on the show so he could sleep with models\\"—are just dishy enough to leave the reader wanting more. Despite stiff prose, an engagingly honest look at the crossroads of comedy and dysfunction.\\" Kliatt gave the Audiobook, read by Mohr, an A: \\"Mohr's experiences make one wonder how the show ever gets on the air. He dishes unflattering portraits of some of the cast and some guest hosts while speaking most fondly of Phil Hartman and Chris Farley. He does not shy from revealing his warts as well.

This sort of motion most commonly deals with discovery disputes, when a party who has propounded discovery to either the opposing party or a third party believes that the discovery responses are insufficient. The motion to compel is used to ask the court to order the non- complying party to produce the documentation or information requested, and/or to sanction the non-complying party for their failure to comply with the discovery requests. The United States court system is divided into three systems; federal, tribal, and state. The federal courts have their own rules which are stated in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The states, on the other hand, have their own codes of civil and criminal procedure. The federal and state rules are similar, but have occasional differences. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 37 Pursuant to FRCP 37, \\"On notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for an order compelling disclosure or discovery. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an effort to obtain it without court action.\\" According to rule 37, the moving party must give the appropriate notice to the responding party. This allows the other party the opportunity to answer the alleged inadequate responses. Thereafter, if the questions have not been adequately responded to, then the moving party may ask the court for a motion to compel. California requires that the moving party provides a statement in support of the motion to compel. This is known as a 3-1020 document which includes the question asked, the answer given, and a reason as to why the answer should be compelled. Failure to Participate in Framing a Discovery Plan. If a party or its attorney fails to participate in good faith in developing and submitting a proposed discovery plan as required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require that party or attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure. Under California state court rules For Interrogatories, there is no time limit for a motion to compel if the party upon which the interrogatories were propounded has failed to respond. However, if the responses are merely insufficient, the propounding party has a 45-day limit in which to submit the motion to compel. Additionally, the propounding party must \\"meet and confer\\" with the responding party prior to submitting the motion. Pursuant to California Rule of Court 3-1345 a motion to compel must include the following parts: (c) Contents of separate statement A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue. The separate statement must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full response. Material must not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference. The separate statement must include-for each discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for admission, deposition question, or inspection demand) to which a further response, answer, or production is requested-the following: #The text of the request, interrogatory, question, or inspection demand; #The text of each response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers; #A statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses, answers, or production as to each matter in dispute; #If necessary, the text of all definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each discovery request and the responses to it; #If the response to a particular discovery request is dependent on the response given to another discovery request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other discovery request, the other request and the response to it must be set forth; and #If the pleadings, other documents in the file, or other items of discovery are relevant to the motion, the party relying on them must summarize each relevant document.

Mascot and school colors With the announcement of the planned Port-Vue Liberty and Glassport merger; there was speculation as to which school's mascot and colors would be used for the new South Allegheny School District. Port Vue-Liberty had their royal blue and gold Bulldogs. Glassport had their red and black Gladiators. It is thought that the mascot was determined by the outcome of a football game between Port-Vue Liberty and Glassport in which the Glassport Gladiators won. The colors are thought to be determined in a similar way with the losing team's colors being chosen as South Allegheny's school colors. Glassport Memorial Stadium Glassport Memorial Stadium was officially opened to the public on October 16, 1950, and as of 2010 is still used by South Allegheny.

The body must be drawn before any other part; the head must be drawn before eyes or antennae Beetle is a British party game in which one draws a beetle in parts. The game may be played solely with pen, paper and a die or using a commercial game set, some of which contain custom scorepads and dice and others which contain pieces which snap together to make a beetle/bug. It is sometimes called Cootie or Bugs. The game is entirely based on random die rolls, with no skill involved.  Playing  The part drawn is decided by the roll of a die. The traditional rolls are: *6 is for the body, of which there is one. *5 is for the head, of which there is one. *4 is for the wings, of which there are two. *3 is for a leg, of which there are six. *2 is for an antenna, of which there are two. *1 is for an eye, of which there are two. The part corresponding to each roll of the die, however, may vary depending on the rules established by the players. It is necessary to roll the correct number for the body before any other part may be drawn. To the body, one may attach the head, legs or wings, but the head must precede the antenna and eyes.

The players are in groups of four with a communal die, and the first player to complete their beetle shouts out \\"Beetle!\\" stopping the play of all the groups. Then the winner of each particular group (the player with the most complete beetle in that group) will move around a circle of tables to the right (clockwise), and the loser (the player with the least complete beetle) to the left (anti-clockwise), or sit still. The ultimate winner is usually either the one who has drawn the most complete beetles, or the one who has drawn the most parts in total.

A modified version of the gun, the 76 mm tank gun M1941 ZiS-5 (76-мм танковая пушка обр. 1941 г. ЗиС-5), was used on KV-1 tanks during World War II. Nowadays, the two versions are often referred to just by their factory designations, as \\"F-34\\" and \\"ZiS-5\\", respectively. History The F-34 was designed before the start of World War II by P. Muraviev of Vasiliy Grabin's design bureau at Factory No. 92 in Gorky. The gun was superior to both contemporary 76.2 mm guns, Gorky's F-32 and the Leningrad Kirov Factory's L-11, but it was the latter that had already been approved for the new T-34 medium tank. The initial T-34 Model 1940 with L-11 was in production when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The F-34 was ready for production, but Marshal Grigory Kulik's high-handed interference with tank appropriation had made the relevant bureaucrats too frightened to approve the better gun. Grabin and the director of the Kharkov Locomotive Factory (KhPZ), the centre of T-34 production, conspired to produce the F-34 anyway, and began to install the gun on new tanks. The new T-34 Model 1941 tanks, which were issued mostly to company and platoon commanders, were immensely popular with their crews. Letters from tank units reached Stalin's State Defence Committee (GKO), which officially authorized production. Also, due to Kulik's meddling, the KV-1 heavy tank model 1940 had ended up mounting Grabin's older F-32 gun, making it more poorly armed than the T-34 medium tank. Chief Designer of Tanks Joseph Kotin convinced the GKO to allow the use of the F-34 gun on the KV-1 heavy tank Model 1941. The ZiS-5 was a version of the gun designed to better fit the KV-1's turret. In 1943, the thick armor of the new German Tiger and Panther tanks had rendered the F-34 gun obsolete, and experiments were conducted to find a replacement. The better-penetrating 57 mm ZiS-2 high velocity antitank gun was installed on some T-34/57 tanks, but the smaller-bored gun couldn't fire an adequate high explosive round for general use. A more heavily armoured T-34 prototype was built, the T-43, but it was still vulnerable to the Tiger's 88, and its mobility suffered too much from the weight of armour. In the end, the F-34 was replaced by the D-5T and ZiS-S-53 85 mm calibre guns on the T-34-85 tank, and by 122mm and 152 mm guns on the new IS-2 heavy tanks and in the Soviets' casemate-type, turretless tank destroyers. Some F-34 guns were also installed in Lend-Lease M4A2 Sherman tanks, known as the M4M.(Zaloga 1984:217)  Comparison of guns  Interior of T-34 Model 1941 turret, with F-34 gun visible.

Moray Place is the large octagonal street marked in red (numbered 3) First Church, located on Moray Place's southeastern quadrant Moray Place is an octagonal street which surrounds the city centre of Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand. The street is intersected by Stuart Street (to the east and west), Princes Street (to the south) and George Street (to the north). Like many streets in Dunedin, it is named for a street in the Scottish capital Edinburgh (Dùn Èideann itself is the Gaelic name of its Scottish sister city). Location and layout The northeastern quadrant between George Street and Lower Stuart Street is flat, but the other three quadrants slope considerably, especially the southeastern and northwestern quadrants. Many of Dunedin's major inner city buildings are located on Moray Place. These include Dunedin Municipal Chambers, Dunedin Public Library, and the grounds of St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral, which lie within the northwestern quadrant between Moray Place and the City Centre (The Octagon). The southwestern quadrant includes the former Dunedin Public Library building (the Carnegie Centre), the Fortune Theatre, and one of the city's main cinemas, the Rialto. This quadrant is regarded as part of the heart of Dunedin's art district, and contains several galleries, one of which is housed in the city's original synagogue. The southeastern quadrant is dominated by First Church, which sits atop the remnants of Bell Hill, the top of which was lowered to allow for First Church's construction. Atahapara, the home and private museum of Thomas Hocken, was located in this quadrant of Moray Place at the top of the steep, historic Burlington Street. The offices of Taylormade Media were also located in this quadrant until the early 2000s. The northeastern quadrant is part of Dunedin's central retail precinct. History The Fortune Theatre, on the corner of Moray Place and Upper Stuart Street. The centre of Dunedin was first laid out by surveyor Charles Kettle during the 1840s. An initial obstacle to the development of the city was Bell Hill, a large outcrop situated where the southeastern quadrant of Moray Place now lies. This effectively split the early settlement of Dunedin in two, and for the first few years of settlement, a cutting through the hill was the only land route between the parts of the town to the north and south. The hill was quarried during the 1850s, providing building material for many of the city's early buildings.Reed, A.H. (1956) The story of early Dunedin. Wellington: A.H. & A.W. Reed. Kettle's initial plan may have been for the entire area within Moray Place to be a public reserve. This did not come to pass, and it was only through Kettle's direct intervention that the central part of the Octagon itself was not built on. As it is, the buildings between Moray Place and The Octagon include many of Dunedin's most prominent structures, and - though it may not have been Kettle's original intention - the concentric octagons of Moray Place and The Octagon are now undeniably the city's centre.Knight, H., and Wales, N. (1988) Buildings of Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe Ltd. In 1897, a fire station was built on Moray Place, located between the Municipal Chambers and St Paul's Cathedral. It was located here for accessibility to the city, but was moved just 14 years later in 1911 because the new motor engines used on the trucks woke residents and caused complaints as they went through the town on callouts. A larger building was also needed to house new equipment.Little, J.S. (1948) A century of fires and fire brigades in Dunedin. Dunedin: Coulls and Somerville Wilkie Ltd. The original building has long since been demolished and a car park now exists on that site. Historic buildings Dunedin's former synagogue, until recently used as an art gallery. Several buildings in Moray Place have Category I or Category II Historic Place classification by Heritage New Zealand. Clockwise from Princes Street, these include the Savoy Restaurant building (I), St James Theatre building (I), former Dunedin Synagogue (I), Moray Terrace (II), former Congregational Church (II), Carnegie Centre (former Public Library) (II), Gainsborough House (II), Fortune Theatre (I), Stephens Inks building (II), Security Building (II), and First Church (I). In addition, Burlington Street, a short, steep street which leads off Moray Place next to First Church, and its environs are classified as a historic precinct, and both St. Paul's Cathedral and the Dunedin Municipal Chambers are Category I historic places with access off Moray Place.

Its mission was to strengthen United States national security by \\"formulating, advocating, negotiating, implementing and verifying effective arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policies, strategies, and agreements.\\" In so doing, ACDA ensured that arms control was fully integrated into the development and conduct of United States national security policy. ACDA also conducted, supported, and coordinated research for arms control and disarmament policy formulation, prepared for and managed U.S. participation in international arms control and disarmament negotiations, and prepared, operated, and directed U.S. participation in international arms control and disarmament systems. 1961 creation Scholars discussing issues of American defense posture and European security during a 1969 ACDA meeting at Lake Mohonk, New York The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established by the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, . The bill was drafted by presidential adviser John J. McCloy. Its predecessor was the U.S. Disarmament Administration, part of the U.S. Department of State (1960–61). Early mission Cover of a 1977 ACDA report on the history of arms control agreements In the 1970s emphasis of the agency was placed upon gaining an understanding of the strategic weapons capabilities of the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China. The electronic reconnaissance capability of the United States was expanded through federal agency research and private contract research, utilizing radio frequency as well as optical technologies. The theory of this mission was that a clearer understanding of other nations' strategic capabilities was an important initial step in prevention of nuclear war. 1997 reorganization In 1997, the Clinton administration announced the partial integration of ACDA with the State Department as part of the reinvention of the agencies which implement the nation’s foreign policy. The ACDA Director served as both the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs and a Senior Adviser to the President and the Secretary of State for Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament. He communicated with the President through the Secretary of State. In his capacity as senior advisor to the president, the Under Secretary attended and participated, at the direction of the president, in National Security Council (NSC) and subordinate meetings pertaining to arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament and had the right to communicate, through the Secretary of State, with the President and members of the NSC on arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament concerns. 1999 end As of April 1, 1999, ACDA was abolished and its functions merged into the Department of State. This was done pursuant to . In particular, ACDA's four Bureaus were merged with the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to form three new Bureaus: Political- Military Affairs, Bureau of Arms Control, and Bureau of Nonproliferation. The functions of the ACDA Director were replaced by the office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs and by the office of the Senior Advisor to the President and the Secretary of State for Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament. Additional reorganizations of the arms control function in those bureaus took place in subsequent years.

Milwaukee Talks: Denis Kitchen, onmilwaukee.com July 12, 2006] In addition to the Milwaukee artists like himself, Mitchell, Bruce Walthers, Don Glassford and Wendel Pugh, Kitchen began to publish works by such cartoonists as Howard Cruse, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Justin Green, Trina Robbins, and S. Clay Wilson, and he soon expanded his operations, launching Krupp Comic Works, a parent organization into which he placed ownership of Kitchen Sink Press and through which he also launched such diverse ventures as a record company and a commercial art studio. In 1980 he invited Cruse to edit Gay Comix, one of the first comics to feature the work of openly gay and lesbian cartoonists. In the 1980s through the early 1990s, Kitchen Sink Press would publish industry legends such as Will Eisner, Harvey Kurtzman, Al Capp, and award-winning alternative creators such as Mark Schultz, Monte Beauchamp, and Charles Burns. In 1993, Kitchen Sink Press merged with Kevin Eastman's Tundra Publishing and relocated to Northampton, Massachusetts. It would go on to publish works by Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, James O'Barr, Don Simpson, and Scott McCloud, winning numerous Eisner and Harvey Awards. Funding defenses Kitchen sketching in April 2016 Kitchen's founding of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund occurred in 1986, after comic store manager Michael Correa was charged with possession and sale of obscene material. Since two of the works cited in the case as obscene were published by Kitchen Sink Press, Kitchen felt some responsibility for Correa's predicament, and so he set about raising funds for the defense of Correa, who saw his conviction overturned on appeal. Kitchen used surplus funds to incorporate the fund as a non-profit charitable organization in 1990. Kitchen served as the fund's president from its inception until 2004, noting on his retirement from the board that \\"The challenges facing comics are different from when I founded the Fund … I think it's fitting that the generation directly facing these challenges … should be the ones standing up to them.\\"CBLDF archives Art agency and art book Kitchen Sink Press as a publisher went out of business in 1999, and Kitchen severed all ties with the company. Subsequent ventures have seen Kitchen establish himself as an art agent, handling the art sales of both Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman amongst others through his company Denis Kitchen Art Agency. He is a partner with Judith Hansen in Kitchen & Hansen Agency, LLC, which serves as a literary agency for Will Eisner's estate. Kitchen is also a partner in Kitchen, Lind & Associates which has served as agency and book packager for clients including The Estates of Harvey Kurtzman and Al Capp, Rebecca Guay, Howard Cruse, Eleanor Davis, Todd M.

High-speed rail is one of the safest modes of transportation; since service started in 1981, there have only been fatalities in high-speed operation in a 2015 derailment. Today TGV trains accumulate of the order of 50 billion passenger-kilometres per year on lignes à grande vitesse (high-speed lines) alone. 1.2 billion passengers have travelled on the TGV. TGV operations fall into two categories: operations on dedicated, TGV-only high-speed lines (LGVs), and operation in mixed traffic on lignes classiques, conventional lines. Indeed, of the total track length served by TGV trains only about 25% (by route kilometre) is high- speed. In understanding the incident summaries below, it is important to bear this distinction in mind. Most of the serious incidents have occurred on conventional lines, where TGV trains are exposed to the same external risks as any other train. High-speed operation was never a factor in any fatal incident in the history of the TGV until November 14, 2015 when a TGV testing on the new Paris-Strasbourg line derailed violently into a canal, killing eleven and injuring the surviving 42 passengers. Following the number of accidents at level crossings, an effort has been made to remove all level crossings on lignes classiques used by TGVs. The ligne classique from Tours to Bordeaux at the end of the LGV Atlantique has no level crossings as a result. Incident summaries The summaries below are not comprehensive. Most of the \\"major\\" incidents are described, but there have been others: On high-speed lines * Excessive speed * An aerodynamic fairing lost due to incorrect maintenance, that broke a window and injured a passenger * At least five strikes of animals on the track * At least two fires, one in a baggage compartment and the other in a power unit * At least two incidents in which a passenger door opened at speed * One instance of concrete placed on the track * One instance of an attempted terrorist bombing of the track  On lignes classiques  * A passenger killed trying to board a moving train * A conductor killed trying to board a moving train * A passenger injured on a platform by a broken shock absorber * A broken tripod (transmission component) * A collision due to operator error during a switching move * An arson attack on an empty parked trainset * Two instances of operator forgetting to set the parking brake, resulting in low-speed collisions with fixed objects. * There have been events where pedestrians on the tracks were hit and killed, both suicides and accidents. The list above together with the summaries below form a complete history of major TGV incidents up to 5 January 2001. Serious incidents=14 November 2015: Derailment at high speed into a canal. Train involved: High speed TGV. Service: testing new Paris-Strasbourg line not yet in passenger service. Location: Eckwersheim, on the LGV Est high-speed rail line Casualties: 11 dead, 42 injured. Cause initially reported as excessive speed. 15 July 2014: Collision with a TER train Trains involved: TGV Atlantique, Z 7300 (TER n°867285) Service: 8585, Tarbes to Paris, on the Pau-Bayonne line Location: Near Denguin Injuries: 40 (4 seriously) A regional express train (train express regional TER) crashed at 90 km/h (56 mph) into the rear-end of a TGV train which was moving at 30 km/h (19 mph) in the same direction ahead of it, due to a faulty signal. 11 October 2008: Low-speed Collision Trainset involved: 4536 (Thalys PBA) Service: Unknown, from Paris to Amsterdam Location: Switching yard near Gouda, Netherlands Injuries: None On 11 October 2008, the Thalys service from Paris to Amsterdam collided with a departing ICM trainset at the station of Gouda. No people were injured. 20 December 2007: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: Sud-Est, 46 Service: unknown, Paris to Geneva Location: level crossing near Tossiat (01) Injuries: 1 dead, 1 serious injury, 24 slight injuries Travelling at about , the train collided with a truck which had stopped on the crossing as it could not fit under the overhead wires. The train derailed and the front power car (23139) was severely damaged and later written off. The truck driver was killed, and on the train there were one seriously injured and 24 slightly injured. 30 January 2003: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: unknown Service: unknown, Dunkerque to Paris Location: level crossing in Esquelbecq (59) Injuries: 1, slight Travelling at , the train collided with a heavy goods vehicle stuck on the level crossing at Esquelbecq in northern France. The front power car was severely damaged, but only one bogie derailed. The train driver was slightly injured. 5 January 2001: Derailment Trainset involved: Atlantique, unknown Service: 8720, Brest - Paris Location: Ligne classique near Laval (Mayenne) Injuries: none. Following a winter storm, a mudslide covered the tracks. The engineer/driver of the 0649 TGV out of Brest, headed for Paris, saw the slide about 300 m ahead and was able to slow to before hitting the mud. A minor derailment of the power car ensued due to the emergency stop. 5 June 2000: High-speed derailment Trainset involved: Eurostar 3101/3102 Service: 9047, Paris - London Location: LGV Nord-Europe, near Croisilles ( south of Arras) Injuries: 14, slight Belgian trainset 3101-3102 was covering Eurostar 9047 (Paris to London), travelling northbound on track 1 of the LGV Nord high speed line at with 501 passengers on board. The engineer detected an anomalous vibration and reduced speed to , before resuming full speed a short time afterwards. At 1754 local time as the trainset passed near the village of Croisilles, south of Arras, at the level of the track switch for the branch line to Arras, a transmission assembly failed. A reaction link on the rear bogie of the leading power car became separated from the bogie frame, leading to catastrophic failure of the transmission assembly with parts falling onto the track. The failure and ensuing emergency stop caused the failed bogie 2 (numbered from the front), bogie 3 and bogie 23 on the trailing power car to leave the rails. The partly derailed train came to a stop safely 1500 m further, causing some damage to the track. 14 people including the British engineer were treated for light injuries or shock, and passengers resumed their trip to London on buses. Once again, as in the 1993 TGV derailment, the articulated trainset architecture was credited with maintaining stability and integrity of the train as it came to a stop. How closely disaster was averted is again debatable. The train remained mostly aligned on the trackbed, thanks to construction and low centre of gravity. 28 November 1998: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: Atlantique, unknown Service: unknown, Brest to Paris Location: level crossing 303, near Guipavas (29) Injuries: none On a day when rail workers were on strike, a double TGV trainset that had left Brest at 0854 struck a stranded semi-truck/lorry just 8 minutes into its journey near Guipavas. The 23‑year‑old driver of the truck jumped out of the way and escaped uninjured after losing his way and getting stuck on the crossing while attempting to turn around. Travelling at less than the TGV struck and destroyed the vehicle, throwing debris onto a waiting car whose occupant also escaped unharmed. The lead power unit sustained heavy damage. 9 May 1998: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: 4345 (Thalys PBKA) Service: train 9344, Amsterdam to Paris Location: near Hoeven, southern Netherlands Injuries: 1 dead, 6 slight injuries A truck attempted to cross the tracks at an unprotected level crossing when the train arrived. The truck driver was killed in the impact and the train's power unit and first two trailers derailed. The trainset was heavily damaged. Six passengers were injured and tracks and catenary were damaged in the incident. Trailers R1 and R2 had to be scrapped. The trainset was later repaired with the R1 and R2 trailers from TGV trainset 502, involved in the 25 September 1997 accident. 19 November 1997: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: Atlantique, unknown Service: Brest to Paris, unknown Location: D140 road at Neau, near Laval Injuries: 6, slight A tractor-trailer combination carrying a load of calcium carbonate became disabled on a level crossing. The driver was able to escape from the vehicle before the train hit it at , derailing one bogie and damaging tracks and catenary. 11 October 1997: Fire Trainset involved: 15 (or 45?) (Sud-Est) Service: train 644, Lyon to Paris Location: near Montchanin, LGV Sud-Est high speed line Injuries: none The train developed a fire in the engine compartment. An emergency stop was performed, and fire services began extinguishing the blaze a half hour later. The fire was confined to the leading power unit of the double trainset formation. The unit involved was a recently renovated Sud-Est set, although it is unknown if this was a factor. The 621 passengers were transferred to another trainset and experienced a five-hour delay. 25 September 1997: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: 502 (Réseau) Service: train 7119, Paris to Dunkerque Location: Bierne, south of Dunkerque Injuries: 7, slight An asphalt paving machine became stranded on a level crossing near Bergues. TGV 7119, running 80 minutes late because of a strike, hit the machine at . The leading power unit left the rails, spun around to the left, and came to rest on its side down the track embankment. The engineer suffered minor injuries, and the unit was destroyed. Four trailers derailed and two left the track bed. None of them rolled over thanks to the articulated design of the train; very few passengers were injured. Trainset 502 was withdrawn from service and stored. The trailing power unit serves as a spare, and trailers R1 and R2 may be used to repair Thalys 4345, involved in the May 1998 level crossing collision. 10 August 1995: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: 394 (Atlantique) Service: train 8737, Paris to Brest Location: Near Vitré, kilometre post 342, PN 172 level crossing with road D34 Injuries: 2, slight A tractor-trailer combination with farm equipment became stuck on the level crossing in a relatively tight, canted curve of the Paris- Brest line. The automatic crossing gates came down and the train, approaching at , hit the unoccupied vehicle. The train did not derail and came to a stop about after the impact following an emergency brake application. Damage was limited to the nose of trainset 394, as well as a catenary mast and level crossing gates. 21 December 1993: High-speed derailment Trainset involved: 511 (Réseau) Service: train 7150, Valenciennes to Paris Location: TGV Haute-Picardie station, kilometre post 110.5, LGV Nord (Paris- Lille) high speed line Injuries: 1, slight This was probably the most spectacular accident involving a TGV, and set a record for the world's fastest derailment. It occurred before the TGV Haute Picardie station was built, near the southern end of where the platforms are located today. After a period of heavy rains, a large sink hole opened under track 2 (southbound). Two trains had already passed this spot and detected no anomaly as late as 10 minutes before the accident. At 0706, TGV 7150 was bearing down at on a muddy hole and deep, bridged by a section of unsupported track. The engineer felt a slight bump and made a service brake application. The last four trailers and the rear power unit derailed, and the train came to a rocky stop over a distance of (somewhat less than it takes for a conventional emergency stop). It was fortunate that the train did not jackknife or leave the track bed; this is credited in part to the stiffness that the articulated design lends to the train. Only one passenger was injured, and another treated for shock. The sinkhole was traced to unstable terrain beneath the track bed, possibly caused by galleries and trenches from World War I. How closely a disaster was averted is a matter of debate; however, the trackbed has since been carefully inspected to prevent similar occurrences in the future. 14 December 1992: High-speed derailment Trainset involved: Sud-Est, unknown Service: train 920, Annecy to Paris Location: Mâcon-Loché TGV station, kilometre post 334, LGV Sud-Est high speed line Injuries: 27, slight The accident trainset had been involved in an emergency stop previously, which resulted in a significant wheel flat. At 0733, the flat spot caused one bogie of the trainset to derail as it passed through the Mâcon-Loché station at . Projections of ballast stones caused injuries to people standing on the station platform waiting for train 970. The train came to a stop safely. 23 September 1988: Level crossing accident Trainset involved: 70 (Sud-Est) Service: train 736, Grenoble to Paris Location: PN 74, Voiron Injuries: 2 dead, 60 injured A special road transport with a weight of 80 tons became stranded on level crossing 74. Train 736, rounding a curve toward the crossing, ploughed into it at . The large mass of the road vehicle made this crash much worse than it might otherwise have been; the engineer and one passenger died, and many more were injured when the first trailer was ripped open by debris. Only the leading power unit derailed. This wreck, the most violent to date, became a reference for the design and crash testing of safety features for the next generation of TGV, as embodied by today's Duplex trainsets. These newer trains have several deformable sections, at the front and rear of the power unit and at the front of the first trailer, to manage and absorb crash energy without damage to passenger compartments. Trainset 70 was never returned to service, and the trailing unit 23140 became a spare in the Sud-Est fleet. 31 December 1983: Terrorist bombing Trainset involved: Sud-Est, unknown Service: Marseille to Paris, Location: Near Tain-l'Hermitage, south of Lyon in the Rhône Valley Injuries: 2 people died in the bombing of the TGV. The bomb was placed in a luggage rack in a trailer vestibule. It exploded at about the same time as another bomb which was placed in a baggage locker in the Marseille St-Charles station. The toll from both bombs totalled 5 dead and 50 injured. Both bombs were the work of the infamous terrorist Carlos the Jackal.

It was coined in 1853 by Daniel Deniehy in what came to be known as the Bunyip Aristocracy speech which he delivered in the Victoria Theatre and on the soapbox at Circular Quay.  Context = Proposals  A committee, consisting of Charles Cowper, T. A. Murray, George Macleay, E. Deas Thomson, J.H. Plunkett, Douglas, W. Thurlow, James Macarthur, James Martin and W. C. Wentworth, appointed on the motion of Wentworth, held its first meeting in Sydney on 27 May 1853. Fifteen meetings were called. Half the members did not attend the meetings. The bill was reported on 28 July 1853.  Opposition  It was almost universally condemned by the people and a large public meeting was called to oppose it. In the advertisement convening the meeting were the following paragraphs: > Colonists ! Will you submit to be robbed of your rights? A committee of the > Legislative Council has framed a new Constitution for the colony, by which > it is proposed: #To create a colonial nobility with hereditary privileges. > #To construct an Upper House of Legislature in which the people will have no > voice. #To add eighteen new seats to the Lower House, only one of which is > to be allotted to Sydney while the other seventeen are to be allotted among > the country and squatting districts. #To squander the public revenue by > pensioning off the officers of the Government on their full salaries, thus > implanting in our institutions a principle of jobbery and corruption. #To > fix irrevocably on the people this oligarchy in the name of free > institutions so that no future Legislature can reform it even by absolute > majority. The Legislative Council has the hardihood to propose passing this > unconstitutional and anti-British measure with only a few days notice, and > before it can possibly be considered by the colonists at large. The meeting was addressed by Sir Henry Parkes and other Liberals, and the result of the agitation was that the most objectionable clause, to create an hereditary colonial peerage, was struck out.Heaton, J.H. 1984, The Bedside Book of Colonial Doings, previously published in 1879 as Australian Dictionary of Dates containing the History of Australasia from 1542 to May 1879, pp. 183–185.  Dan Deniehy's Bunyip aristocracy speech  In response to Wentworth's proposal to create a hereditary peerage in New South Wales, Deniehy's satirical comments included: \\"Here, we all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a bunyip aristocracy.\\" (The bunyip is an Ancestral Being of Aboriginal Dreaming.) Deniehy's ridicule caused the idea to be dropped. Among those singled out in his speech by Deniehy was James MacArthur (1798–1867), the son of John MacArthur, who had been nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1839 and was later (1859) elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (the lower house was only created in 1856): > Next came the native aristocrat James MacArthur, he would he supposed, > aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and > he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green, > and emblazoned on this field should be a rum kegThis is a reference to the > Rum Rebellion in which John Macarthur played a major role. of a New South > Wales order of chivalry.  Aftermath  The strong popular support for Deniehy's views caused the abandonment of the proposal to which he was responding. It probably also delayed the introduction of an Australian honours system. The Order of Australia was not introduced until 1975. Until that time Australians were awarded British honours.  Legacy  \\"Bunyip aristocracy\\" is now a pejorative term for those Australians who consider themselves to be aristocrats.  References  External links  * Ged Martin: Bunyip Aristocracy.

A related term is extended scene, the longer version of a scene that was shortened for the final version of the film. Often, extended scenes are included in collections of deleted scenes or are referred to as deleted scenes themselves, as is the case with, for instance, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Serenity. Reasons for removal Scenes are often removed from films at the request of a studio or network, or to reduce running time or to improve narrative flow. Requests for alteration The studio or network planning to air or distribute it may be uncomfortable with a certain scene. It may ask for it be altered, removed, or replaced. That is most common in the production of television series since networks and channels often must be mindful of how viewers, critics, or censors will react to programming. There may be a fear of losing ratings, being punished by fines or otherwise, or having trouble finding advertisers. * The 2002 Fox series Firefly's original pilot episode (\\"Serenity\\", parts 1 and 2) had such a change made, with the original, less action-packed scene being replaced in the final cut of the episode but featuring on the later DVD box set release of the series, as one of several bonus features.Joss Whedon, audio commentary in Firefly, The Complete Series (DVD box set), 21st Century Fox, 2003 * A scene in the pilot of 24 involved the destruction of a Boeing 747. Aired just a few months after the 9/11 attacks, the producers made some creative edits to cutout shots of the plane visibly exploding. Running time Concerns about running time may also cause scenes to be removed or shortened. In feature films, scenes may be cut to reduce the length of the film's theatrical cut. In television serials, however, running time becomes an even greater concern because of the strict timeslot limitations, especially on channels supported by advertisements, and there may be only 20 minutes of actual show per half-hour timeslot. Depending on the station and the particular format of the show, that may or may not include opening credits or closing credits; many ad-supported stations now \\"squish\\" the closing credits or force them into a split-screen to show more advertising. Most programs are in either a half-hour or a one-hour timeslot. That forces producers of television serials to break up the acts in a manner that will (hopefully) make the viewer want to continue watching after the ad break and to avoid exceeding the stricter running time limits. Disruption of narrative flow Though the quality of the initial and the final cuts of a film is subjective, a scene or version of a scene in a film may have an adverse effect on the film as a whole. It may slow the film down, provide unnecessary details or exposition, or even explain points that should be implied or said more subtly. It is common to remove such scenes at the editing level, but they may be released on the home video release, as a bonus feature. There are at least a few examples, including a number of the deleted scenes on the DVD release of the sequel film Serenity (in fact, the audio commentary on the DVD's deleted scenes collection quite often mentions the plot or the tension being disrupted or slowed by including a scene or too much expositional as the main reason for the scene's removal from the final theatrical cut. Another well known example is the cocoon sequence in the film Alien. The scene added a lot of information about the fate of several crew members and new information on the life cycle of the creature, but it was ultimately deleted, as it was thought to slow down and to disrupt the tension of the end of the film. Formats Deleted or extended scenes may be in any of several different formats. They may or may not feature finished special effects (especially in science fiction and fantasy films in which visual effects are more expensive), and the film quality may or may not be the same as in the rest of the film, but that may depend only on how much post-production editing was done. Additionally, deleted scenes of animated films may not be in the form of a fully animated scene but instead be included in the form of an animatic or a blooper form, as is the case with the deleted scenes on the DVD release of Pixar's Toy Story and Finding Nemo.Finding Nemo, DVD, Pixar, 2003 Parody The DVD release for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's feature film also featured not only a handful of regular deleted scenes but also two spoof \\"Really Deleted\\" scenes.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, DVD, Touchstone Pictures, 2005 YTVs ZAPX sometimes makes \\"deleted scenes\\" that are not genuine deleted scenes but random scenes of the movie with footage of the program's host, Simon, inserted into the clip, for that purpose. On the DVD for UHF, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic provides commentary of the deleted scenes and emphasizes that there are hours of film footage but that they were all removed for good reasons.

It was located on the Cooper's Hill estate, near Egham, Surrey. It functioned from 1872 until 1906, when its work was transferred to India. The college was colloquially referred to as Cooper's Hill and \\"I.C.E. College\\" (I.C.E. being an acronym for Indian Civil Engineering). History A Public Works Department was created in India in 1854, with responsibility for the construction of roads, canals and other civil engineering projects. It experienced difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified staff from the United Kingdom, and in 1868 a scheme was proposed for a dedicated training college in England. The chief advocate of this scheme, and effective founder of the college, was Sir George Tomkyns Chesney.Farrington 1976, pp. 135–6. The India Office bought the Cooper's Hill estate for £55,000 in 1870; and the college was formally opened on 5 August 1872, with Chesney as its first President.Farrington 1976, p. 136. The college educated about 50 students a year, who paid fees of £150 each. The curriculum included pure and applied mathematics, construction, architectural design, surveying, mechanical drawing, geometry, physics, geology, accounts, Hindustani, and the history and geography of India.Farrington 1976, p. 137. By the late 1870s the college was training more civil engineers than were required in India; but, rather than scaling down its activities, Chesney broadened them. From 1878, the college began to train candidates for the Indian Telegraph Department.Farrington 1976, pp. 137–8. From 1881, it began to train candidates for non-Indian services, such as the Royal Engineers, the Egyptian Government, and the Uganda Railway.Farrington 1976, pp. 138. In 1885, the first forestry school in England was established at Cooper's Hill, with William Schlich as the founding director. In the face of competition from new training facilities for engineers elsewhere (notably at the new \\"redbrick\\" universities), the college closed on 13October 1906.Farrington 1976, p. 138. Architecture The principal building at Cooper's Hill was a mansion house erected c. 1865 for the unprincipled company promoter, Baron Albert Grant, to a semi-Gothic design by F. & H. Francis. The conversion of the house for educational use, the design of the interiors, and the addition of a new south wing (including a chapel) were undertaken by the architect Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt. Rugby football team In its day, the college's rugby union team, referred to by its opponents as \\"Cooper's Hill\\", was one of the most prominent rugby clubs in England. In the 1870s, it produced a number of famous international players including Stephen Finney, Petley Price, W. C. Hutchinson, N. F. Macleod, and F. D. Fowler. By the 1890s, the team was deemed of medium strength, and a long way behind the form of its heyday. This was put down to boys leaving school earlier than they had previously, thus the team became composed of men who were physically smaller in stature and physique than their predecessors.Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) It boasted the following internationals who played for their countries whilst attending the college: *Stephen Finney (first capped 1872) *Henry Marsh (first capped 1873) *John Davidson (first capped 1873) *Josiah Edward Paul (first capped 1875) *W.

The company presented its first productions in 1975, and in the following four decades has become known and respected nationwide for the identification and presentation of the finest young artists, for the musical and dramatic integrity of its productions, and for the ingenuity and variety of its education and outreach programs. The company has an annual budget of $5 million with over 30 performances, reaching nearly 50,000 attendees each season. In March 1994, by unanimous vote of the Virginia General Assembly, Virginia Opera was named The Official Opera Company of the Commonwealth of Virginia in recognition of the organization's contribution to the Commonwealth, and to the world of opera. Virginia Opera currently presents four productions a year at four major Virginia venues: Norfolk's Harrison Opera House, Richmond's Carpenter Theatre at Richmond CenterStage, George Mason University's Center for the Arts in Fairfax, and the Sandler Center for the Performing Arts in Virginia Beach. Virginia Opera is the only opera company to perform a full season of operas in multiple mainstage venues and to reach more than 150,000 students and community members each year through its innovative Education and Outreach Program. Beginnings Organized in 1974 by founding chair Edythe C. Harrison, Virginia Opera was launched with two productions in the Norfolk Center Theater. Dr. David Farrar was the founding Stage Director and Director of Productions of the Virginia Opera. He was responsible for twelve years of innovation and vitality, during which the company experienced a period of tremendous growth. Dr. Farrar invited Peter Mark to the company and Mark was appointed Artistic Director, a position he held for over 35 years. He was named Artistic Director Emeritus in 2012. Russell P. Allen, appointed President and CEO in 2011, currently leads the company, returning to Virginia Opera after previously serving six years as General Manager from 1994-2000. The company's first three seasons were limited to Norfolk. Expansion to Richmond began in 1977 with the encouragement of then-Governor Mills Godwin and Mrs. T. Fleetwood (Anna) Garner, under whose leadership \\"The Richmond Friends of Opera\\" was formed to present Virginia Opera productions annually in Richmond. By 1983, the Richmond and Central Virginia Board of Virginia Opera was formed and a Richmond office was opened. In November 1992, the company presented its first mainstage performance at the Center for the Arts at George Mason University in Fairfax. This development was hailed as \\"one of the major local operatic events of the year\\" by The Washington Post, and deemed a special day in music history for the Washington, D.C. area by Opera News. Artists Some of the nation's most promising young singers have appeared on the company's stages and in concert. These have included Luciano Pavarotti, Beverly Sills, Renée Fleming, Diana Soviero, Lawrence Brownlee, Barbara Dever, Jeannine Altmeyer, Ashley Putnam, Cristina Nassif, Frederick Burchinal, John Aler, Rockwell Blake, Randy Locke, Jake Gardner, Sujung Kim, Frank Porretta, Grant Youngblood, Fabiana Bravo, Mary Elizabeth Williams, Nmon Ford, Jeniece Goldbourne, Randall Scarlata, and Thomas Rolf Truhitte. Attracting acclaimed directors from the theater and opera world, the company has given audiences the experience of seeing the work of Gian Carlo Menotti, Gordon Davidson, Greg Ganakas, Arvin Brown, Dorothy Danner, Lillian Groag and Sam Helfrich, among others, in new productions designed by the nation's top opera and theatre designers. Virginia Opera repertoire, 1974 to 2015 The first few seasons consisted of standard works such as La boheme, La traviata, Tosca, Lucia di Lammermoor and The Barber of Seville, all presented in the 1975 to 1976 period. Full Details, including full casts and production personnel of past seasons' productions are available on the company's website. Many standard works are still performed, but each season typically contains a variety of operatic styles from different eras. Added to these have been productions of American musicals such as Man of La Mancha (1987), West Side Story (1994), Carousel (1996) Oklahoma! (1997), Sweeney Todd (September/October 2014) as well as several comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan such as The Pirates of Penzance (1999), The Mikado (2001) and HMS Pinafore (November/December 2014). While many of productions have focused on the standard repertory of popular operas which are frequently performed by most companies, Virginia Opera is also noted for its innovative programming of rarer or new works. These are noted below. Works performed in the non-standard repertoire The company has produced notable world and American premieres of new works, including most recently American composer Ricky Ian Gordon's Rappahannock County, a Civil War song cycle co-commissioned by Virginia Opera, the Virginia Arts Festival, the Modlin Center of the University of Richmond, and the University of Texas at Austin. Rappahannock County premiered in Norfolk on April 12, 2011, the 150th anniversary of the firing upon Fort Sumter, South Carolina. Earlier world and American premieres included operas by Scottish-American composer Thea Musgrave, including Mary, Queen of Scots (1975—77),Mary, Queen of Scots: details of the opera on theamusgrave.comA Christmas Carol (1978—79),A Christmas Carol: details of the opera on theamusgrave.com Harriet, The Woman Called Moses (1984),Harriet, The Woman Called Moses: details of the opera on musicsalesclassical.com and Simon Bolivar (1992).Simon Bolivar: details of the opera on theamusgrave.com Amongst some of the more unusual operas performed over 40 years were the double bill of Mozart's The Impresario along with the popular Pagliacci in March/April 1977. The baroque era has been well represented by Handel's Giulio Cesare in early 1997, his Rodelinda in February 2000 and Agrippina in early 2007. Stagings of some bel canto classics not so often performed in the 1980s such as Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi in Spring 1981, Norma in October 1983 and again in January 1994, along with Donizetti's Anna Bolena in January 1989 reflect a broad approach to the repertoire. Amongst several of Wagner's operas, The Flying Dutchman entered the repertory in January/February 1996, while Die Walkure followed in the fall of 2002 and again in early 2011. Richard Strauss is represented by Ariadne auf Naxos in 2014, although it was given several times over the earlier years, and there have been several productions of Salome, the next appearing in January/February 2015. Elektra was given in early 2002. In addition to the Musgrave premieres, other 20th century American works have included Porgy and Bess several times beginning in 1980; Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors in December 1982 and his The Medium in early 1992; Andre Previn's 1998 A Streetcar Named Desire was seen in February/March 2013; Aaron Copland's The Tender Land appeared in early 1998; and Carlyle Floyd's Susannah was staged in November 2006.

They numbered approximately 1,000 and lived primarily along the Rappahannock River west of modern Fredericksburg and the Fall Line, and east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. They united with the Monacan, the Occaneechi, the Saponi and the Tutelo. They disappeared from the historical record after 1728. Etymology According to William W. Tooker, the name Manahoac is Algonquian for \\"they are very merry\\", but anthropologist John R. Swanton considers this dubious. History After thousands of years of different indigenous cultures in present-day Virginia, the Manahoac and other Piedmont tribes developed from the prehistoric Woodland cultures. Historically the Siouan tribes occupied more of the Piedmont area, and the Algonquian- speaking tribes inhabited the lowlands and Tidewater. In 1608 the English explorer John Smith met with a sizable group of Manahoac above the falls of the Rappahannock River. He recorded that they were living in at least seven villages to the west of where he had met them. He also noted that they were allied with the Monacan, but opposed to the Powhatan. (The historic Manahoac and Monacan tribes were both Siouan-speaking, which gave them some shared culture and was part of the reason they competed with the Algonquian-speaking tribes of the Powhatan Confederacy.) As the Beaver Wars upset the balance of power, some Manahoac settled in Virginia near the Powhatans. In 1656, these Manahoac fended off an attack by English and Pamunkey, resulting in the Battle of Bloody Run (1656). By the 1669 census, because of raids by enemy Iroquois tribes from the north (during the Beaver Wars) and probably infectious disease from European contact, the Manahoac were reduced to only fifty bowmen in their former area. Their surviving people apparently joined their Monacan allies to the south immediately afterward. John Lederer recorded the \\"Mahock\\" along the James River in 1670. In 1671 Lederer passed directly through their former territory and made no mention of any inhabitants. Around the same time, the Seneca nation of the Iroquois began to claim the land as their hunting grounds by right of conquest, though they did not occupy it.Fairfax Harrison, 1924, Landmarks of Old Prince William, p. 25, 33. In 1714, Lt. Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood recorded that the Stegaraki subtribe of the Manahoac was present at Fort Christanna in Brunswick County. The fort was created by Spotswood and sponsored by the College of William and Mary to convert natives to Christianity and teach them the English language. The other known Siouan tribes of Virginia were all represented by members at Fort Christanna. The anthropologist John Swanton believed that a group at Fort Christanna, called the Mepontsky, were perhaps the Ontponea subtribe of the Manahoac. The last mention of the Ontponea in historic records was in 1723. Scholars believe they joined with the Tutelo and Saponi and became absorbed into their tribes. In 1753, these two tribes were formally adopted in New York by their former enemies, the Iroquois, specifically the Cayuga nation. In 1870, there was a report of a \\"merry old man named Mosquito\\" living in Canada, who claimed to be \\"the last of the Manahoac\\" and the legal owner of much of northern Virginia. He still remembered how to speak the Siouan language.Harrison, p. 34. Culture Like the other Siouan tribes of Virginia's Piedmont region (i.e., the Monacan, Tutelo and Saponi), the Manahoac people lived in various independent villages. The Siouan tribes interacted in various ways, such as through trade, cultural celebrations, and also intermarriage. Manahoac villages were usually along the upper Rappahannock River where the soil was most fertile. They practiced a mixture of hunting and gathering as well as farming. Along the upper James River, where the closely related Monacan tribe was located, archeologists have found remnants of corn and squash in cooking pits. Also found along the James are the outlines of three oval houses at a site outside the town of Wingina in Nelson County, Virginia. Given the close relations of the Monacan and the Manahoac, scholars believe these aspects of their cultures were similar or identical. Many stone tools have been unearthed in areas which the Manahoac inhabited. They are usually made of the milky quartz common in the region. Their pottery was tempered with quartz and sand; it often featured fabric, net, or cord motifs as decoration. Archaeological evidence shows that an earthen mound burial culture existed in the Piedmont from 950 AD to the time of European contact. It spanned the so-called Late Woodland Period. These burial mounds, some of them reaching heights of at least , are believed to have been made by the ancestors of the Manahoac and other eastern Siouan groups. They are unique in that they contained hundreds to thousands of corpses. They are sometimes called \\"accretional mounds\\". The people added more soil to them as additional individuals were buried within. Most of the burial mounds have been either completely destroyed by plowing or significantly reduced in size by erosion and flooding. Organization The Manahoac are sometimes viewed as a confederacy of tribes, or as a single tribe composed of several subtribes. These include the following: * Hassinunga, who were at the headwaters of the Rappahannock River; * Manahoac proper, who, according to Thomas Jefferson, were present in Stafford and Spotsylvania counties; * Ontponea, who were located in Orange County; * Shackaconia, who were found in Spotsylvania County on the southern bank of the Rappahannock; *Stegaraki, who were in Orange County along the Rapidan River; * Tegninateo, who were located in Culpeper County at the head of the Rappahannock; and the * Whonkentia, who were present in Fauquier County near the head of the Rappahannock Colonists recorded the name of one village: Mahaskahod; it was most likely located near modern Fredericksburg. Language The language of the Manahoac is not known, although John Smith stated that they spoke a language different from that of the Monacan. Anthropologist James Mooney in 1894 suggested that the Manahoac spoke a Siouan language, based on his speculation that the town called Monasickapanough was related to Saponi. He also claimed that the town Monahassanugh was the same as the name Nahyssan, Hanohaskie (a variant spelling of a Saponi town), and Yesaⁿ (Yesaⁿ is the autonym of the Tutelo). His argument was based on the assumption that the initial syllable Mo-, Ma- was supposedly a Virginia Siouan morpheme meaning, \\"place, earth, country\\". More recently, Ives Goddard has pointed to problems with Mooney's claimed evidence and argued that it is more probable that these town names are from the Virginia Algonquian language, which was the language of John Smith's guides. Additionally one town appears to be from Algonquian pidgin. Because John Lederer stated that two of the tribes he listed spoke the same language, Mooney assumed Lederer's Managog was a misspelled Monahoac, and that Monahoac and Saponi must be the two tribes with a common language. The common language may, in fact, be Virginia Siouan, which was used as a lingua franca spoken by both Siouan and Iroquoian peoples. Thus, Mooney's interpretation is not supported by the primary sources. It may also be possible that the Manahoac were a group of peoples who spoke more than one language for trade reasons.

His paintings are best known for their brown monochrome palette. He was a close friend of the sculptor Rodin and his work influenced Picasso. Some see traces of Carrière's monochrome style in Picasso's Blue Period. Biography He was born at Gournay-sur-Marne (Seine-Saint-Denis). He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and later under Cabanel. During the Franco-Prussian War he passed some time as a prisoner in Dresden, where the art of Rubens made a lasting impression on him, as may be seen in the glowing colors of his early paintings. About 1890 he adopted the gray, misty-color scheme with contrasts of light and shadow, so characteristic of his art, but which no other artist has been able to imitate without affectation. His themes usually are scenes of his domestic life, and he repeatedly introduced the likeness of his wife in his paintings. The first of these, The Young Mother (1879), is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen. It was followed by, The Sick Child (Montargis), The First Communion (Toulon), and the highly praised 1887 portrait of the sculptor Louis-Henri Devillez.Louis-Henri Devillez in his Studio, by Eugène Carrière, 1887, tumblr.com Carrière was one of the leaders in the secessionist movement, which led to the founding of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts.

Ramree (locally pronounced Ram Bray) is situated on Ramree Island. Ramree is the capital of the township of the same name and former capital of the district of Ramree (until 1852 ). It is close to the east coast of the Ramree island , about 25 km north of the Tan River. The population of Ramree (Yanbye) Urban area is 9,581 as of 2014, while Ramree Township's population is 97,891. Etymology The name \\"Ramree\\" (ရမ်းဗြဲ) is derived from the former name of island: Rammar Wati (ရမ္မာဝတီ) which meant Pleasant Region (Rammar= Pleasant) (Wati = Region). The administrative town of Rammar Wati was called \\"Rammar Wati Pri Myo\\" and then acronymic way, town's name was shorten to Ram Pri Myo (ရမ်ပြည်မြို့) which was heard by Portuguese firstly landed Europeans to this town as Rama Ree or Rama Ri later it was noted as Ramri or Ramree. History During the existence of the kingdom of Arakan, it was the site of a Governor of the island and then it was also called Tan-Myo (name that subsequently subsisted Tan river locally). Under Burmese dominion it was conserved as the capital of a district, but called Yan-bai-myo or Yanbyemyo (abbreviated Yanbye) while the Arakans called it Ran- Breh-myo, abbreviated Ran-breh, from which its current name derives, Corruption of this word for Europeans. At the beginning of the 19th century it was a prosperous city with an intense trade with Bengal, Vasai and Tavoy ; but a few years later he suffered seriously during the rebellion of Khyin-Bran (Chinbryan, King Bering) since 1811, and the repressive measures of the Burmese; Khyin-Bran had many supporters in the city and after his defeat and death in 1815 a large number of inhabitants were assassinated or forced to flee the country. In the first Anglo-Burmese War the city was occupied without fighting for the forces of General MacBean, when it had already been evacuated by the Burmese; After the formal annexation of Arakan in 1826 at the end of the war, Ramree was declared a capital of the district of Ramree, until 1852 when the districts of An and Ramree were united and the capital of the new district passed to Kyaukpyu that from 1838 was An capital. The population in 1853 was estimated to have 9,000 inhabitants, three-fourths of Arakana, but the loss of capitalism made it lower in importance and in 1877 it appears with only 4,028 inhabitants; The census of 1881 was 3,461.

During World War II the Battle of Ramree Island was fought during January and February 1945, as part of the British 14th Army 1944/45 offensive on the Southern Front of the Burma Campaign.

However, the veracity of this story has been disputed and the facts suggest that, while a small number of Japanese soldiers were likely killed by crocodiles (the only verifiable mention is of 10-15 men killed by crocodiles while crossing Min Chaung creek near Ramree town), the vast majority likely died due to a variety of other reasons including dehydration, drowning, British gun-fire, dysentery, and perhaps even a small number to sharks as well (Platt et al. 1998).  Wildlife  Saltwater crocodiles were still common in the Ramree Island region up and into the 1960s, but the region no longer supports a viable population of crocodiles, likely due to hide-hunting, and by the early 1980s evidence suggested only scattered individuals remained.  Pipeline  Ramree Island is also the location of a gas pipeline system that transports oil and gas from the Indian Ocean coast to the province of Yunnan in China. From a deep water port on Kyaukphyu in Rakhine State and from Ramree Island, oil from the Middle East and gas from Myanmar's ocean coast is transported through the pipelines to China. The pipelines enable China to rely less on ocean-transported oil and gas through the treacherous Strait of Malacca and also cut two weeks off the transport time.

Berro, a 21-year-old citizen of Lebanon, is accused by Argentine, U.S. and Israeli officials of blowing up the headquarters of Argentina's Jewish community. Hezbollah describes the accusations as \\"categorically false\\". Berro grew up in Lebanon. According to his brothers, around 1989 he changed radically, leaving school and becoming interested in Hezbollah, where his brother Ali was an active member. His mother feared Berro would end up badly, and applied for a visa for him to go to Detroit -- to where some of the family had emigrated -- but the application was turned down because Berro was underage. He then traveled to Iran, where he presumably received training. Berro is suspected of having entered Argentina near Ciudad del Este -- a region known for smuggling, drugs, and other illegal activities -- where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina share a border, accompanied by a man named Ahmed Saad. The bombing, in which a van full of explosives opposite the AMIA building was detonated, was similar to the March 1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires, possibly also committed by Hezbollah. The attacks, it appears, occurred with the support of Iran, though the Iranian government repeatedly denied these charges. Two months after the attack, Berro was reported by radio stations in Lebanon to have been killed by the Israeli army, apparently an attempt to cover up his role in the attack in Argentina. After the bombing, Berro's wife received $300 a month from Hezbollah. In late 2005, Berro was identified as the bombing perpetrator after years of investigation and speculation into who committed the bombing. According to official Argentine government prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, Hussein's two US-based brothers had testified that he had joined the radical Shia militant group Hezbollah. \\"The brothers' testimony was substantial, rich in detail and showed that he was the one who was killed,\\" Nisman added. A U.S. House resolution in July 2004 declared Berro was the suicide bomber, but the identification was not declared positively until November 2005 after Berro's relatives in Detroit identified his photograph. Berro was also recognized with \\"80 percent certain[ty]\\" by eyewitness Nicolasa Romero, who saw the driver in the van near the AMIA building. Some Argentine journalists, however, have expressed reservations about these alleged findings; in an op-ed for La Nación, Jorge Urien Berri objected to those who \\"insist in taken hypotheses as proven when they not\\", and contested Berro's involvement in the incidents\\". Berro's two brothers also had denied this version in April 2005 before a US prosecutor, stating that Berro had died on September 9, 1994 during combat in Lebanon. No proper autopsies or DNA tests were done. The police dumped in a bin the head thought to be that of the bomber.Buenos Aires bomber 'identified', BBC News, November 10, 2005 Berro's brother, after apparently identifying Berro in a photograph, now denies that Berro had any role in the attack. \\"They changed the truth,\\" he said. \\"I gave them the photo [of Berro] at 17 years old, but when I saw photo in the news, I said, 'How are they publishing the photo that I gave them a few months back? They said in the news that I identified the photo, and it's not true. I gave them the photo of him at 17, but I don't know who is in the others.\\" In a May 2007 interview, James Cheek, Clinton's Ambassador to Argentina at the time of the bombing, told La Nación,http://www.thenation.com/article/bushs-iranargentina-terror- frame?page=0,2# \\"To my knowledge, there was never any real evidence [of Iranian responsibility]. They never came up with anything.\\" The hottest lead in the case, he recalled, was an Iranian defector named Manoucher Moatamer, who \\"supposedly had all this information.\\" But Moatamer turned out to be only a dissatisfied low-ranking official without the knowledge of government decision-making that he had claimed. \\"We finally decided that he wasn't credible,\\" Cheek recalled. Ron Goddard, then deputy chief of the US Mission in Buenos Aires, confirmed Cheek's account. He recalled that investigators found nothing linking Iran to the bombing. \\"The whole Iran thing seemed kind of flimsy,\\" Goddard said.

Libraries of polypeptides displayed on the surface of bacteria can be screened using flow cytometry or iterative selection procedures (biopanning). This protein engineering technique allows us to link the function of a protein with the gene that encodes it. Bacterial display can be used to find target proteins with desired properties and can be used to make affinity ligands which are cell-specific. This system can be used in many applications including the creation of novel vaccines, the identification of enzyme substrates and finding the affinity of a ligand for its target protein. Bacterial display is often coupled with magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) or fluorescence- activated cell sorting (FACS) techniques. Competing methods for protein evolution in vitro are phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, and mRNA display. Bacteriophage display is the most common type of display system used although bacterial display is becoming increasingly popular as technical challenges are overcome. Bacterial display combined with FACS also has the advantage that it is a real-time technique. History Cell display systems were first used in 1985, when peptides were genetically fused with proteins displayed on the M13 bacteriophage. Bacteriophage display is a commonly used cell display system, although it carries limitations in the size of proteins that can be displayed. Bacterial display was then introduced in 1986, allowing the surface display of larger proteins. Bacterial display systems were first introduced by Freudl et al. and Charbit et al. in 1986, when they used bacterial surface proteins OmpA and LamB to display peptides. Freudl et al. fused peptides with linkers with the ompA gene, causing the peptides to be expressed in the OmpA proteins. They showed that the proteins were now subject to cleavage by proteinase K. The non-OmpA peptides inserted were therefore a target of proteinase K. Insertion of the foreign peptides did not affect bacterial cell growth. Charbit et al. firstly defined the areas of the LamB protein that were \\"permissive\\" for foreign petide insertion (ie that did not lead to a complete loss of functionality of the protein). Then, they explored the versatility of the permissive sites (size limit, nature of the epitope,...) that were all located in surface-exposed loops of the trimeric outer membrane porin, aiming at developing multivalent live bacterial vaccines (12-15). This was the first evidence of using bacterial surface display techniques to express proteins on the surface of cells, without altering the function of the cell. Principle Peptides are very useful as therapeutic and diagnostic substances. Their use is getting more popular, and display systems offer a useful way to engineer peptides and optimise their binding capabilities. Cells express surface proteins which can be involved in a whole host of responses including recognition of other cells, interaction with other cells, and cell signalling. Many types of bacteria have cell surface proteins such as the enteropathogenic E. coli intimin protein which is involved in binding to host cells, or the OmpA protein of E. coli cells which is important in keeping the structure of the outer membrane. Many surface proteins are involved in bacterial cell attachment and invasion of the host cell. By using bacterial display, target proteins on the host cell can be identified. These surface proteins need to first be translocated across the bacterial cell membranes from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. Gram-negative bacteria have an additional periplasmic space, which Gram-positive bacteria lack, so they have a harder task of translocating proteins. The display of heterologous proteins on the bacterial cell surface normally requires the fusion of the protein with a surface protein, called a scaffold. Autotransporter System (Type V Secretion System) Scaffold Scaffolds are used to display the heterologous protein on the bacterial cell surface. There are various scaffolds which have been used such as outer membrane proteins, fimbriae/flagella proteins and CPX (circularly permuted OmpX). The CPX scaffold allows peptide fusion at both termini of the scaffold. OMPs are common scaffolds for bacterial display. Proteins can also be displayed on the bacterial cell surface through the use of autotransporters. Autotransporters form part of the type V secretion system. They usually have three domains: leader sequence at the N-terminal; central passenger domain; autotransporter domain at the C-terminal. The heterologous protein is inserted at the passenger domain. Another method of heterologous protein fusion is fusion with fimbriae/flagella, which are filamentous protrusions on the cell surface. There are many fimbriae on mainly Gram-negative bacteria, so displaying proteins on fimbriae is advantageous over some other surface proteins which are less numerous. A disadvantage of using fimbriae is that there is a relatively small insert size limit of 10-30 amino acids. Flow Cytometer Instrument Once the heterologous protein has been fused with the bacterial cell surface protein, it is exposed to either an enzyme, a cell (expressing a target protein) or an antibody (usually fluorescently tagged), depending on the application of the experiment. The sample is then passed through a beam of light during FACS, in a very narrow stream of fluid so that only one cell can pass at a time, and the fluorescence emitted is detected. Information on the size of the cell can be obtained by the scattering of light and if binding of the heterologous protein with the target protein/cell has occurred, there will be more fluorescence emitted. Applications Bacterial surface display can be used for a variety of applications. These include affinity-based screening, antibody epitope mapping, the identification of peptide substrates, the identification of cell-binding peptides and vaccine generation. Affinity- based Screening Screening is used to find the apparent affinities of heterologous proteins displayed on the bacterial cell surface for target proteins. This method is usually combined with FACS, and the addition of a non-fluorescent target protein competitor is beneficial to obtaining more accurate binding affinities. Adding a competitor reduces the chance of target proteins rebinding, which would render the binding affinity less accurate. Antibody Epitope Mapping Antibody epitope mapping is used to find the specificity of an antibody. The epitope (antibody binding site of antigens) is expressed on the bacterial cell surface by expressing a region of the gene encoding the antigen. Flow cytometry with fluorescently-labelled antibodies is used to detect the amount of antibody binding to epitope. Identification of Peptide Substrates This can be applied to find the best substrates for proteolytic enzymes. The substrate is displayed on the bacterial cell surface between an affinity ligand and the scaffold, and the kinetics of substrate proteolysis is measured using FACS. Identification of Cell-binding Peptides Bacterial display can be used to find peptides which bind to specific cells e.g. breast cancer cells or stem cells. Displayed proteins are fluorescently tagged with GFP, so binding interactions between peptides and target cells can be seen by flow cytometry. Control samples are required in order to measure fluorescence levels in the absence of displayed peptides. Samples are also required which don’t contain displayed peptides, but contain mammalian cells and bacterial cells (including the scaffold). Vaccine Delivery Vaccine delivery is a very common application of bacterial surface display. There are two types of live bacterial vaccines that can be made: # Normally pathogenic bacteria are weakened so they are no longer pathogenic. # Commensal or food-grade bacteria which are not pathogenic. Using bacterial surface display of antigens is a valuable alternative to conventional vaccine design for various reasons, one of them being that the proteins expressed on the bacterial cell surface can act favourably as an adjuvant. Conventional vaccines require the addition of adjuvants. Another advantage of generating vaccines using bacterial display systems is that the whole bacterial cell can be incorporated in the live vaccine Unlike bacteriophage display systems which are generally used in vaccine development to find unknown epitopes, bacterial display systems are used to express known epitopes and the cells act as a vaccine delivery system. Comparison with phage display Under similar conditions, selection of bacterial-displayed peptides to model protein streptavidin proved worse. References 12\\\\.

Since 2005, Semir Osmanagić, also known as Sam Osmanagić, a Bosnian American businessman now based in Houston, Texas, has claimed that these hills are the largest human-made ancient pyramids on Earth. His claims have been overwhelmingly refuted by scientists but he has proceeded to promote the area as a tourist attraction. Direct study of the site by geologists, archaeologists, and other scientists have demonstrated that the hills are natural formations known as flatirons, and that there is no evidence that they were shaped by human construction. The European Association of Archaeologists has condemned the so-called 'Bosnian pyramids' as a \\"cruel hoax;\\" along with various other scholars, they are also concerned about damage being done to genuine archaeological and paleontological sites: a medieval Bosnian castle, Roman fortifications, and some even more ancient remains.Declaration from the European Association of Archaeologists , 11 Dec 2006 Osmanagić initiated excavations in 2006 and has since reshaped one of the hills, making it look like a stepped pyramid.Woodard, C. (2007) \\"The Great Pyramids of…Bosnia?\\", Chronicle of Higher Education. vol. 53 no 30, pp. A12–A18. March 30, 2007.Pruitt, T. (2012a) \\"Performance, Participation and Pyramids: Addressing Meaning and Method Behind Alternative Archaeology in Visoko, Bosnia\\". in A. Simandiraki and E. Stefanou, eds., pp. 20–32, From Archaeology to Archaeologies: the 'Other' Past’., BAR International Series no. 2409. Archaeopress, Oxford, England. The academic community has called for the government to end funding of excavations and disruption of the site because of the damage to true archaeological resources. Many scholars have noted that the claims have been used for serious ideological, political and economic gains by various factions in Bosnia. Although Osmanagić's claims have been completely disproved by the scientific community, the Visoko area in recent years has attracted pseudoscience enthusiasts; the so-called Bosnian pyramids and the Ravne tunnels have been morphed into \\"New Age pilgrimage sites.\\" By June 2016, Osmanagić had completed an \\"archeological park\\" at one of the hills, where he attracts volunteers who are constructing botanical gardens; meditation sessions have been held at the site. It has been noted that tourist traffic has aided the economy of the city of Visoko, located near the front of the war that destroyed so much of the country in the late 20th century. As of 2017, Osmanagić continued to make alterations to the hills and add to his marketing about them. His work at the time was based on private funding. Osmanagić's claims The hills are located near the town of Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo. The town was Bosnia's capital during the Middle Ages, and ruins of a medieval fortress are located atop Visočica hill. Given the defensive strategic value of hilltop locations, other civilizations built facilities at this site: the fortress was built over an old observation post of the Roman Empire, which, in turn, had been constructed on top of the ruins of a further more ancient settlement. The hills are a type known as flatirons. Archaeological geologist Paul Heinrich of Louisiana State University has said that such formations are common throughout the world, for example, the so-called 'Russian Twin Pyramids' in Vladivostok, and there are many in the nearby region. In October 2005, Osmanagić and his supporters initiated a long-running media campaign to promote the pseudo-scientific belief that Visočica hill and the surrounding hills are an ancient pyramid complex. In an interview with Philip Coppens in Nexus (April–May 2006), Osmanagić suggested that they were most likely constructed by the Illyrians, who (according to Osmanagić) lived in the area from 12,000 BC to 500 BC. He has since argued that Visočica is an example of cultures building on top of other cultures. In 2017 Osmanagić was reported to have claimed that the structures date back 34,000 years. In addition, Osmanagić claims that tunnels around the hill complex, which have been named Ravne tunnels, are an ancient man-made underground network. They are claimed to be 2.4 miles (3.8 km) long. He claims to have found fossilised leaves in them dating back 34,000 years. Osmanagić supports a number of fringe claims, saying he discovered 'standing waves' at the top of the largest of the hills; waves which he asserts travel faster than light and prove the existence of a 'cosmic internet' that allows for intergalactic communication. He also promotes the idea of ancient astronauts, and believes that human beings are the product of genetic engineering. Osmanagić has given his own names to the hills. He has named the two largest hills as the 'Pyramid of the Sun' and the 'Pyramid of the Moon' (not to be confused with the genuine pyramids of the Sun and the Moon in Teotihuacan, Mexico). Other hills have been named by Osmanagić as the pyramids of 'Love,' 'the Earth,' and 'the Dragon.' Local authorities have funded his excavations, and authorized visits to the 'pyramids' by school children, with guides telling them the hills are part of their Bosnian heritage. The site has become a tourist destination. Osmanagić's methodology and alleged evidence According to Osmanagić, the dig in 2006 involved an international team of archaeologists from Australia, Austria, Ireland, United Kingdom and Slovenia.Australian in Bosnia pyramid riddle, Sydney Morning Herald, 20 January 2006 But, many archaeologists whom he named have stated they did not agree to participate and were never at the site.Mark Rose, \\"Bosnian 'Pyramids' Update\\", Archaeology Magazine Online, 14 June 2006 Osmanagić also claimed the support of an \\"Oxford archaeologist,\\" who was found to be an unqualified undergraduate. His foundation's website claimed support of a British Member of Parliament; the name given was not that of any sitting member.John Bohannon, \\"Researchers Helpless as Bosnian Pyramid Bandwagon Gathers Pace\\", Science, 22 December 2006, #314:1862 Osmanagić claims that the direction of the hills reveals alignment to support ancient human cosmology. According to Enver Buza, a surveyor from Sarajevo’s Geodetic Institute, the \\"Pyramid of the Sun\\" is perfectly oriented to the north. Osmanagić has said that the sides of the pyramid are oriented toward the cardinal points, and has claimed that this could not be produced by natural processes. Osmanagić's claims have also centred on alleged evidence concerning satellite photography, thermal analysis and radar detection. An article by Ian Traynor for The Guardian in 2006 reported that Osmanagić and his team alleged that their results from such research showed that the hills were not natural formations and that tunnels may exist inside the hills. According to Osmanagić, his excavations have produced evidence of blocks that he claims may be part of a man-made outer surface. Osmanagić claims that these blocks are made of a concrete poured on-site that was stronger than today's versions. Scholarly response Osmanagić's claims have been repeatedly condemned by qualified scientists and archaeologists. Seven leading European archaeologists issued a European Association of Archaeologists Declaration stating: :We, the undersigned professional archaeologists from all parts of Europe, wish to protest strongly at the continuing support by the Bosnian authorities for the so-called \\"pyramid\\" project being conducted on hills at and near Visoko. This scheme is a cruel hoax on an unsuspecting public and has no place in the world of genuine science. It is a waste of scarce resources that would be much better used in protecting the genuine archaeological heritage and is diverting attention from the pressing problems that are affecting professional archaeologists in Bosnia-Herzegovina on a daily basis. The Declaration was signed by Hermann Parzinger, President of German Archaeological Institute in Berlin; Willem Willems, Inspector General of Rijksinspectie Archeologie in The Hague; Jean-Paul Demoule, President of the Institut nationale de recherches archéologiques préventives (INRAP) in Paris; Romuald Schild, Director of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw; Vassil Nikolov, Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in Sofia; Anthony Harding, President of the European Association of Archaeologists; and Mike Heyworth, Director of the Council for British Archaeology in York. Osmanagić's assertions have been categorically refuted by a number of experts, who have accused him of promoting pseudo-scientific notions and damaging valuable archaeological sites with his excavations. Amar Karapuš, a curator at the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo, said, \\"When I first read about the pyramids I thought it was a very funny joke. I just couldn't believe that anyone in the world could believe this.\\" Garrett Fagan of Penn State University is quoted as saying, \\"They should not be allowed to destroy genuine sites in the pursuit of these delusions[...] It’s as if someone were given permission to bulldoze Stonehenge to find secret chambers of lost ancient wisdom underneath.\\"Nick Hawton, Indiana Jones of the Balkans and the mystery of a hidden pyramid, Times Online, 15 April 2006 Enver Imamović of the University of Sarajevo, a former director of the National Museum of Sarajevo, concerned that the excavations will damage historic sites such as the medieval royal capital Visoki, said that the excavations would \\"irreversibly destroy a national treasure\\".Lucian Harris, \\"Amateur to dig on site of medieval capital in search of Bosnia's own Valley of the Kings\\", The Art Newspaper, 15 April 2006 Excavations in the summer of 2008 by archaeologists who are not related to Osmanagić's Foundation uncovered medieval artifacts, which led to renewed calls for the government to cancel Osmanagić's digging permits. A former employee, Nadija Nukić, told a Bosnian newspaper that carvings on stones that Osmanagić characterizes as dating from ancient times were not present when the stones were first uncovered. They were later inscribed by Osmanagić's team. Osmanagić has denied this statement. Responses by archaeologists Curtis Runnels, an American expert on prehistoric Greece and the Balkans from Boston University, states that the inhabitants of the area, to whom Osmanagić credits the building of the 'pyramids', were a primitive people who were small in number and who \\"did not have the tools or skills to engage in the construction of monumental architecture.\\"Rose, Mark. \\"The Bosnia-Atlantis Connection\\". Archaeology Magazine Online. URL accessed 2006-04-29. Runnels has said that cultures able to build large structures of that type emerged in the region only around 2,500 years ago, but did not construct such earthworks. He has also pointed out that a pyramidal shape is resistant to certain forces; it is a surviving, common form produced by natural causes. After visiting Visočica hill, British professor Anthony Harding, president of the European Association of Archaeologists, wrote a letter to The Times (published 25 April 2006), referring to Osmanagić's theories as \\"wacky\\" and \\"absurd\\". He expressed concerns that the government of Bosnia had insufficient safeguards in place to protect the country's \\"rich heritage\\" from \\"looting and unmonitored or unauthorised development\\". (Full Article) Brian Stewart, assistant curator at the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology at the University of Michigan, said that \\"There were very worrying reports that he [Osmanagić] and his team have essentially sculpted the sides of these natural hills into something they think resembles pyramids, in the process stripping away sediment which contains layers of actual archaeology from mediaeval and earlier periods\\". In June 2006, archeologist Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, wrote a letter to Archaeology Magazine after his name became linked to the excavations.\\"Bosnian 'pyramid' created by nature, say European experts\\", AFP, Hurriyet Daily News, 12 June 2006. Osmanagić had allegedly said that Hawass had recommended Egyptian geologist Aly Abdullah Barakat to investigate the hills. Hawass denied all involvement, accusing Osmanagić of spreading falsehoods; in his letter he noted that Barakat had no archaeological knowledge or standing. He further noted that Osmanagić was totally wrong to claim that the Mayan civilization of Mesoamerica originated in Atlantis or the Pleiades constellation.Zahi Hawass, \\"Letter to Archaeology Magazine\\" (pdf), Archeology, June 2006 Responses from geology community conglomerate layers Visočica hill conglomerate layers The Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Foundation commissioned a geological team from the University of Tuzla to investigate Visočica. On 8 May 2006, members held a press conference in Tuzla to present the results of their research. The academics, from the Faculty of Mining and Geology and led by Sejfudin Vrabac, concluded that the hill is a natural geological formation, made of clastic sediments of layered composition and varying thickness, and that its shape is a consequence of endodynamical and exodynamical processes in the post-Miocene era. The 'pyramid' is composed of the same matter as mountains in the area; layers of conglomerate, clay and sandstone. According to Professor Vrabac, who specializes in paleogeology, there are dozens of similar morphological formations in the Sarajevo-Zenica mining basin alone. The geological team report on Visočica, based on the data collected in six drill holes at 3- to 17-metre depths, is supported by the Research and Teaching Council of the Faculty of Mining and Geology, as well as by the Association of Geologists of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2006, self-styled geologist from Egypt, Aly Abdullah Barakat, claiming to be an expert on pyramids, inspected some blocks at the hills and announced at first look that they were evidence of pyramids. In a geological report dated 3 November 2007, Barakat denied that nature produces pyramidal shapes and suggested that the main formation seen today may have been a natural hill shaped into a pyramid by human efforts. He described his own results as inconclusive.\\"At last, Dr. Barakat’s report\\", IRNA, 8 May 2006 The very same blocks were inspected by British archaeologist Anthony Harding shortly afterwards, who concluded they did not constitute evidence of pyramids.Aida Cerkez-Robinson \\"British Expert Nixes Bosnia Pyramid Claim\\", Washington Post, 9 June 2006 The 2006 dig uncovered fractured conglomerate and sandstone plates, which are naturally occurring. Following a visit to the site, American geologist Robert Schoch concluded that these were common natural geological formations of little interest. He accused the workers of carving the hillside to make impressions of stepped sides on the so-called 'Pyramid of the Moon', and drew attention to testimony by workers at the site that the alleged ancient inscriptions at the site were freshly made. , The New Archaeology Review vol 1.8, pp. 16–17, September 2006 Schoch's website documents the alleged damage being done by Osmanagić's digs, and accuses Osmanagić of \\"a deliberate smear campaign\\". Responses by sociologist Colin Woodard, writing for the Smithsonian Magazine in December 2009, has suggested that the 'Bosnian pyramid' phenomenon may be a societal reaction to the widespread destruction and horrors of the Bosnian War which ended in 1995. He notes that Bosnian leaders, including one prime minister and two presidents, and many Bosnian news outlets have welcomed the theory. It appears to flatter a large and receptive domestic audience with an idea that their homeland was once the seat of a great ancient civilization, and holds out a kind of promise of a bright economic future. Conversely, Woodard notes, those in Bosnia who have attempted to expose the project as a nationalist hoax \\"have been shouted down and called anti-Bosnian\\". Archaeologist Carl Fegan has similarly suggested that Osmanagić appeals to Bosnian nationalists at a time of continuing struggle with economic and social difficulties since the war. Thousands of people in the region were killed in the war, and \\"authorities estimate the Visoko region suffered about $200 million in damage with the destruction of infrastructure and factories.\\" With a current population of 11,000, the town of Visoko has many shop owners who are glad to have tourist traffic to help generate revenue in the local and regional economy. Some Bosnians who have volunteered to dig or otherwise work at the site are glad to have something positive to work for. Tourism Osmanagić claimed to have attracted 200,000 tourists in the first year of his operations at the site. In 2006 he was seeking funding from investors in Malaysia to construct an archeological park. He also intended to establish parks around other landmarks which he claims as ancient monuments and scientists say are natural features. Attendance has declined somewhat at the Bosnian hills since the early years, but souvenir sellers say they still depend on the steady business. Osmanagić has added events claimed to enhance the spiritual atmosphere at the site; for instance, meditation sessions are held in the so-called Ravne tunnels, which he claims to have discovered. In August 2016, Osmanagić claimed that 5,000 people had visited the archeological park since it opened in June of that year. In 2016 Osmanagić's foundation opened Ravne 2 park. The park is visited by tens of thousands of tourists on a yearly basis, but also by a large number of locals and visitors from the surrounding area. It is supported by the Visoko municipal government and Zenica-Doboj canton. The Visoko municipal council declared it as a park of significance.

He was a regular contributor to the Impressionistes et Symbolistes, and a founding committee member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1912, he was awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur for his contributions to French art.Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, Base Léonore, Archives Nationales, Culture.gouv.frVauxcelles, p.265-283 During the latter part of his career, he is remembered for his work overseeing set and costume design for the Théâtre des Arts and the Paris Opera. His works appear in many important national collections, including the Musée d'Orsay, the Hermitage Museum and the National Gallery of Art. A large collection of his theatrically related work is held at the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra National de Paris. Dethomas is also remembered for his close friendship with the artist Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, his brother in-law Ignacio Zuloaga and his association with Les Nabis and other important Post- Impressionist and Symbolist artists and writers. Dethomas died in 1929 at the age of 61, and was buried at the Passy Cemetery, Paris.Prade, p.131  Early life and formal education  Maxime Dethomas c.1895 Born in the Paris suburb of Garges-lès-Gonesse in 1867, Maxime Dethomas was the eldest of six children, including four half-siblings. His family came from a long line of painter- printers on one side, and lawyers on the other. His father, Jean-Albert Dethomas (1842–1891), was an important Parisian politician and lawyer. His mother, Laure-Elizabeth Antoinette Béchet, died at the age of 27 in 1874. His step mother, Marie Louise Thierrée, belonged to the affluent middle-class of Bordeaux.Milhou 1991; Taylor, p.78 Maxime Dethomas (centre) with his artist companions (c. 1890) During 1885, Dethomas first met Augustine Bulteau (1860-1922), matriarch of the Parisian arts community and one-time wife of prominent author and playwright, Jules Ricard (1848-1903). Bulteau would go on to become a pivotal figure in his life, helping him navigate a difficult relationship with his father, guiding his academic direction and encouraging his development as an artist. Each year, Dethomas would take extended breaks at Bulteau's estates in Léry and Venice - trips that would feature prominently in his art.Milhou 1991, 288-289 In 1887, Dethomas enrolled at the École des Arts Décoratifs at which he studied briefly, preferring instead to pass much of his time at the bookshop of the Revue Indépendante, a favourite haunt of young artists and writers run by Edouard Dujardin. It was here that he first met Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.Milhou 1991, p.51 It is an often repeated, yet erroneous claim that Dethomas' relationship with Toulouse- Lautrec was one of master and student - at least in the formal sense of the term - though their shared experiences and mutual respect for each other as artists was of undeniable consequence.Milhou 1991, p. 63 In an 1898 letter, Dethomas reflected on Toulouse-Lautrec's art: > The things I see by him always give me an intense desire to work. The things > of this boy, who, if he has no talent, certainly has a little genius, are > always for me a whiplash [coup de fouet]. It's as if I was shown the way > with a sudden invitation to advance. The master paintings do not give me > that, we are stupefied with admiration. We are blocked, discouraged, after > them we are let down, we are in prison.Milhou 1991, p.64 Maxime Dethomas (right) with Agustine Bulteau at Léry, Côte-d'Or (c.1890) Maxime Dethomas and unknown model at the Bulteau Estate (c.1900) Disgruntled with his experiences at the École des Arts Décoratifs, Dethomas began taking informal instruction at the private workshop of the young master, Henri Gervex. In 1888, Gervex began his tenure as instructor at l'Académie Libre on rue Verniquet - Dethomas applied and was accepted, continuing his formal education under Gervex. During this period, Dethomas became firm friends with fellow Gervex student and future brother-in-law, Ignacio Zuloaga. Through Dethomas, Zuloaga gained entrée into French artistic circles; reciprocally, Zuloaga introduced Dethomas to other Spanish expatriate artists, including the so-called Catalan Band: Santiago Rusiñol, Ramon Casas, and Miquel Utrillo.Milhou 1979; 1991 The final phase of Dethomas' formal education commenced from 1891 onwards, where he followed a more varied course at the Académie de La Palette, 104 Boulevard de Clichy, Montmartre, under Henri Gervex, Puvis de Chavannes and Eugène Carrière.Taylor, p.78; Milhou 1991, p.289 Carrière's tutelage played a significant role in the early development of Dethomas' art, and he would go on to be a close friend of both the artist and his family.Milhou 1991  Art  A self portrait captured by Maxime Dethomas in his Montmartre studio c.1895 Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Misia Natanson in Maxime Dethomas' studio c.1895Perruchot, 1960 La dame au miroir - Maxime Dethomas c.1895. Pastel (67 x 47cm). Pushkin Museum, Moscow. Acquired by Shchukin in 1903 from Durand Ruel. Maxime Dethomas with his Siamese cat (c.1900) Dethomas' early style owes most to the influence of Carrière and Degas, whilst later works tend more towards that of Toulouse-Lautrec, Anquetin and Forain.Wright, p.221 Dethomas claimed that his inspiration was guided by artists of earlier generations, particularly Goya, Delacroix and Manet, but his individuality of style ensured he would \\"not be influenced in his work by any methods or thoughts other than his own\\".Taylor, p.78Vauxcelles, p.265-283 In 1905, influential critic Louis Vauxcelles praised Dethomas as a \\"shrewd and penetrating observer\\" that captured his subjects \\"with a powerful sobriety\\".Vauxcelles 1905, p.1 He realised vigorous drawings, and some few oil paintings, showing portraits, cafe scenes, and urban landscapes of Italy and Spain. He primarily worked with broad strokes in conté, graphite, charcoal and pastel, often enhanced by watercolour and the masterful use of the spatter brush, with drizzles and sprays of gouache reminiscent of Lautrec lithographs.Vauxcelles, p.265-283 From the late 1890s, he drew inspiration from Japanese prints - said to have been introduced to him by Toulouse-Lautrec - and developed a bold xylographic style which lent itself to woodcut reproduction.Vauxcelles, p.265-283 Like many of his contemporaries, Dethomas explored various artistic mediums, including book illustrations, posters and print making. By 1895, he was designing programmes for Lugné-Poe's Théâtre de l'Œuvre and exhibition and advertising posters with print makers such as Edward Ancourt, Eugène Verneau and Auguste Clot. With his drawings engraved by Léon Pichon and Emile Gasperini, he illustrated close to thirty books by many prominent authors including Maurice Donnay and Octave Mirbeau.Milhou 1991 Dethomas engaged models from both within his social circle, as well as otherwise unremarkable characters from urban life, searching out peculiarities of appearance that betrayed the social facades of the fin de siècle.Vauxcelles, p.265-283 Having cut ties with his bourgeois pretensions during an 1891 move to Montmartre, Dethomas followed in the footsteps of his mentors, hungry to find authentic expression of the human condition amongst the daily struggles of the urban poor.Milhou 1991, p.65 \\"His characters are all scoundrels\\", joked Degas.Vauxcelles 1905, p.1 Two such 'scoundrels' would go on to lead remarkable lives, in no small part due to their association with Dethomas. Then artist's model Suzanne Desprès became romantically involved with Dethomas in June, 1894, and continued to feature prominently in his art for some years, later becoming a famous actress and wife of theater director Lugné-Poe.Milhou 1991, p.107-120 Prior to meeting Picasso in 1904, Fernande Olivier would also model for Dethomas with some regularity, her memoirs painting a vivid picture of her time in Dethomas' studio: Degas, an avid supporter of Dethomas, spoke highly of his work asserting \\"it has weight\\".Roger-Marx, 140 Described by Philippe Berthelot as \\"le meilleur fils de Degas\\", Dethomas nonetheless exhibited sparingly during the 1890s.Berthelot 1902, p.2 Contemporary accounts suggest a \\"supercilious modesty prevented him from over-exhibiting his work though no artists merchant forbade him\\". In a letter written by Lautrec in the summer of 1895 to Joseph Ricci, Lautrec refers to Dethomas as his dear friend and compliments him as a painter \\"who doesn’t talk about his paintings, something that is to be admired\\".Frey, p.411 Despite his early reluctance to exhibit, he participated in some of the most significant exhibitions of the 1890s. His first solo exhibition in 1900 marked a turning point in his willingness to accept notoriety, leading to considerable accolades and public recognition.Milhou 1991 Dethomas' art passed through the hands of many prominent art dealers including Jos HesselVauxcelles 1905, p.1, Galerie Durand-Ruel and Galerie Druet. Consequently, many of his works were acquired by influential collectors including Olivier Sainsère and Sergei Shchukin. Dethomas is also known to have had his works framed by the frame-maker Pierre Cluzel (1850–1894), and his successor, Louis Vivien. In 1912, Dethomas was awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur for his contributions to French art.Milhou 1991 File:Maxime Dethomas - La femme au parapluie (1896).jpgMaxime Dethomas: La femme au parapluie (1896).

Premiered November 25th, 1910. Dethomas was also responsible for set and costume design. From 1910 to 1913, Dethomas worked under Jacques Rouché during his tenure at the Théâtre des Arts. Upon assuming management of the theater, Rouché enlisted the talents of several artists who had contributed to his magazine, La Grande Revue, including Jacques Dresa, René Piot and Maxime Dethomas, none of which had previously worked for the stage.Garafola, p.86; Milhou 1991, p.164-171 As director of the services plastiques, Dethomas embarked on a career that would last for the remainder of his life. The Théâtre des Arts represented a major shift away from facile acting, shallow content and the painted-canvas drawing rooms of commercial theater that were the norm. The inaugural production, Le Carnaval des Enfants (1910), marked a major theatrical revolution by which Dethomas' settings accentuated line and colour, rather than a focus on painted detail and endless props. Against blue, ochre, grey and steel, black costumed characters created striking pictorial compositions in lighting effects that \\"varied like inflections in a conversation\\".Londre, p.498; Milhou 1991, p.175-217 Couperin (1911). In addition to this poster, Dethomas also created sets, costumes and a programme. The Théâtre des Arts went on to present nearly twenty plays, including Jacques Copeau's adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov (1911), and the stage production of La Tragédie de Salomé (1912), both a popular and critical success.Garafola, p.154; Taylor, p.88 Dethomas' reputation as a set and costume designer was such that by early 1912, he was commissioned by the British aristocracy to design a set and costumes for a London masked ball with some two thousand guests.Howard, p.92 Hired to direct and decorate at the Paris Opera in 1914, Rouché and Dethomas went on to offer fresh interpretation of old material and to make inroads into stale scenic convention.Londre, p.498 By 1917, Dethomas was also designing sets and costumes for the Comédie Française; the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in 1919; the Théâtre Femina and Le Trianon in 1920; and the Opéra-Comique in 1926 as it celebrated Manuel de Falla's 50th birthday. With a program consisting of La Vida Breve, El Amor Brujo, and Master Peter's Puppet Show, Falla's close friend Ignacio Zuloaga and Dethomas collaborated to create sets and marionettes.Agen, p.150,180; Carson, p.79; Milhou 1991 During his seventeen years in the theatre, Dethomas was artistic designer for over fifty plays, ballets and operas, featuring many of the era's most notable actors, dancers, singers, playwrights and composers, including Roussel, Stravinsky and Ravel.Milhou 1991, p.292-297 In his colour schemes Dethomas used visual analogy paired with the play-writer's thematic intent, \\"the progression of each scene following perfectly the progression of the drama\\".Taylor, p.88 Dethomas once wrote that above all else decor should be a good servant of the play and that a designer must get beyond a \\"painterly feel\\" to something more solid.Cheney, p.5, 92 Guillaume Apollinaire declared that Dethomas' influence on French Theatre had \\"transformed the art of scenery, costume design and staging.\\"Apollinaire, p.221 File:Theatre set design for Carnaval des Enfants at the Théatre des Arts (1910) by Maxime Dethomas.jpgSet design for Act I and Act III of Carnaval des Enfants, 1910.

Associations = Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (left) and Maxime Dethomas (centre) with unknown model in Lautrec's studio (c.1890) During 1887 Dethomas began frequenting the library-bookshop of the Revue Indépendante, a favorite haunt of young artists and writers, in which he first befriended Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.Milhou 1991, p.50-52) Their friendship blossomed – so much so, that Dethomas would go on to become Toulouse-Lautrec's \\"favourite companion\\" and \\"closest friend\\".Berthelot, p.2; Craven, p.280 Always drawn to physical eccentricity, Toulouse-Lautrec nicknamed the 6'6\\" Dethomas 'Gros n'abre' (roughly: Big Tree), for his imposing height and dead-pan face;Gold, p.53; Milhou 1991, p.52 puts his height at 6'1\\" - it's likely somewhere in between. Thadée Natanson described him as a gentle giant, polished and discreet – \\"He was so frightened of wearing anything that might draw attention to himself that even the black of his clothes seemed duller than that worn by others.\\"Perruchot, p.140 Dethomas' placidity, corpulence and extreme shyness - he always blushed when he had to raise his voice - endeared him to Toulouse-Lautrec.Lassaigne, p.119 Paul Leclercq claimed that Lautrec was fascinated by Dethomas' \\"ability to preserve an impassive appearance even in a place of amusement\\".Cooper, p.130 Whilst much has been made of the comical dynamic of their friendship, Tolouse- Lautrec also derived an element of utility from his companion. Calm and seemingly distant, Dethomas generally walked through life a discreet and unassuming character. However, when he accompanied Toulouse-Lautrec, their contrasting heights invariably attracted attention, the bowler hat of the little man barely reaching Maxime's elbow. Yet the jeers stopped at the quiet strength of Gros n'arbre. Contemporaries, like Gustave Coquiot, bear witness to this: \\"Lautrec loved Maxime Dethomas very much. This tall and strong fellow towered over him. With him, he felt under real protection. When together in the street, Lautrec never heard any ridicule. Dethomas, impassive and cold, always muzzled the crowd.\\"Frey 1991, p.71 Philippe Berthelot recalled that Toulouse-Lautrec playfully attributed his companion super-human strength and would loudly declare with mock seriousness that Dethomas \\"could have anyone's hide at his leisure!\\".Perruchot, p.140; Berthelot 1902, p.2 Maxime Dethomas, Thadée Natanson and H.T. Lautrec, Saint-Malo (1895-96) In the first days of 1891, Dethomas moved to an apartment at 8, Cité Pigalle, Montmartre - selected no-less for its proximity to the workshop of Eugène Carrière, than to that of his friends Toulouse-Lautrec and the photographer Paul Sescau.Milhou 1991, p.59-60 They lived but streets apart, often visiting the cafes, cabarets, shady bars and brothels of Montmartre, including the Moulin rouge and Le Chat Noir, or extended stays at the notorious closed-houses, the Rue de' Amboise or the Rue Joubert.Perruchot, p.173, 233; Frey 1991 By 1894, Tolouse-Lautrec and Dethomas were exhibiting together at le Barc de Boutteville.see: exhibition reviews, 1894 Misia Natanson, Thadée Natanson and H.T. Lautrec, Saint-Malo (1895-96) On the 16th February, 1895, an infamous soiree was held by the Natansons to celebrate the unveiling of new murals by Vuillard. Chosen from among his friends more for the comedic effect than for his bartending skill, Dethomas assisted Toulouse-Lautrec serving drinks, replete with absurd costumes and flourishes of theatrical drama. Together they served over two thousand cocktails to three hundred guests. The event was long remembered as one of the most debaucherous evenings of the fin-de-siècle.Perruchot, p.201 Such escapades played an essential role in the development and themes of both Dethomas' and Toulouse-Lautrec's art.Neret, p.133 Musée Toulouse-Lautrec, Albi Dethomas and Toulouse-Lautrec's adventures together were not limited to the streets of Paris. If Dethomas' close friend Gabrielle Dorziat is to be believed, during the month of October, 1894, Dethomas and Toulouse-Lautrec travelled to Spain together, stopping at Madrid, Cordoue and Seville.Milhou 1991, p.289; Taylor, p.78 In subsequent years their travels continued, visiting exhibitions, museums and mutual friends or exploring towns such as Granville, Arromanches and Dinard, at which Dethomas had made use of a summerhouse.Mack, p.318; Frey, p.411 During the summer of 1895, they journeyed to the coast of Normandy together.Cooper, p.130; Frey, p.411, 434 From photographs taken by Dethomas at Saint-Malo with the Natansons during one such trip, he later modelled two portraits of Toulouse-Lautrec, both of which are held at the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec.Frey, p.411 Panneaux pour la baraque de la Goulue by H.T. Lautrec (1895). Maxime Dethomas looks on from the right.Frey, p.410 Musée d'Orsay, Paris. From June 20 to July 5, 1897, Dethomas and Toulouse-Lautrec sailed Holland's canals on a barge, visiting Utrecht, the Frans Hals Museum at Haarlem and the island of Walcheren. The trip had been the suggestion of Maxime in a vain attempt at moderating Henri's increasing reliance on alcohol.Perruchot, p.235 Accounts differ, but the trip appears to have ended early at Toulouse-Lautrec's behest. Before long, he went into a furious rage and refused to go ashore; children were running behind the barge on the bank of the canal, taking them to be a performing giant-dwarf duo that would perform circus tricks for their delight.Berthelot, 1902; Cooper, p.130; Gauzi, p.27; Southbank, p.538; Hecht, p.5; Gold, p.53; Perruchot, p.235, 236 Débauche avec Dethomas (c. June, 1896) - H. T. Lautrec. Taken \\"from nature\\", Dethomas is pictured slyly reaching around an unidentified prostitute. A copy of this litho was given by the author to his friend. From Lautrec's hand, this dedication : \\"Au Gros n'arbre\\".Milhou 1991, p.74 During the mid-1890s, Lautrec featured Dethomas in his art with some frequency.Frey, p.411 On April 6, 1895, the former Moulin Rouge dancer Louise 'La Goulue' Weber commissioned two large canvases to adorn her travelling show's tent. Dethomas appears on the left- hand panel, looking down toward La Goulue.Frey, p.410 At around the same period, Toulouse-Lautrec declared \\"I will capture your immobility in places of pleasure\\", and over the course of one and a half years, he made numerous preparatory sketches of Dethomas intended for a single painting, each taking anywhere from five to fifteen minutes to create.Gale 1902; Berthelot 1902, p.2; Perruchot, p.226 Completed in 1896, the famous portrait of Maxime Dethomas at the Bal de l'Opera now hangs in the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.. Another portrait of his friend took the form of a risque lithograph entitled Debauche Avec Dethomas, and was later used on the cover of an exhibition catalogue of June, 1896.Perruchot, p.233 Finally, an 1896 lithograph entitled Anna Held et Baldy also features Dethomas, leering provocatively at the famous stage performer. Toulouse-Lautrec gifted an annotated proof copy of this lithograph to Dethomas.Hotel Drouot sale no. VIII, March 3, 1928, Lot 144. Anna Held et Baldy (1896) - H.T. Lautrec. Lautrec gifted an annotated proof copy of this lithograph to Dethomas. During the final years of Toulouse-Lautrec's descent into full-blown alcoholism, Dethomas would rarely leave his side, often escorting him to his Montmartre home at the end of long drinking sessions.Perruchot, p.231; Berthelot 1902, p.2 The two would spend many hours working and talking together at Henri's last Paris studio on avenue Frochot, sometimes sharing the same models, at all times Dethomas attempting to steer conversation away from the topic of alcohol.Milhou 1991, p.75 Henri's increasingly erratic behaviour was beginning to take its toll on both his family and friends. In a letter from December 8, 1898, Dethomas' discusses a lunch invitation he attended at Toulouse-Lautrec's home, at which Henri's mother was also present. Drama unfolded when conversation turned to Henri's troubles with a pair of naked mouthwash- drinking models - the lunch finally ending with Henri red-faced and shouting at his mother, declaring he could not stand life anymore, and that he will leave for Japan.Milhou 1991, p.75 Eight days later, Dethomas writes again of yet another event that fell victim to Henri's drunkenness, this time a dinner at Goupil's. Things began well, but before dessert had been served, Henri had passed out beneath the dining table, awaking at midnight with loud complaints about how low the ceiling was. \\"The poor boy is really in a pitiful state of health\\" Dethomas continued, \\"senility is approaching, death perhaps.\\"Milhou 1991, p. 75 It's unclear if Toulouse-Lautrec attended Dethomas' first solo exhibition during April of 1900, though accounts of the Paris Exposition held the same month describe Henri's health having deteriorated to such an extent that he asked Maxime to push him around the various exhibits in a wheel chair - a request to which he dutifully obliged.Frey, p.482 The following month, on the suggestion of friends, Toulouse-Lautrec departed Paris for the country. In April of 1901, upon hearing news of a stroke, Dethomas traveled to Bordeaux to see his friend. At the end of his stay, Henri recounted that he had taken Gros n'abre to the train station for his return to Paris, and given him a going- away present of two chameleons \\"who rolled their eyes terribly. We drank cafe au lait together at the station, and he's off like Saint-John the Baptist, the Forerunner, to announce my arrival.\\"Frey, p.488; Mack, p.358 When Dethomas learned of his friend's death, he wrote to his mentor Madame Bulteau, Friday, September 13, 1901: '''' Bulteau's reply of September 16 summed up very well the tone of the relationship between the two friends and the reason for the little man's deep attachment to his Gros n'abre: '  Jean de Tinan  In 1895 Dethomas formed what would become a brief but significant fiendship with the young writer, Jean de Tinan. The charismatic twenty-one year old was a new arrival in Paris, and was soon a daily participant in the circuit of bars, cafes and theatres that Dethomas and Lautrec would frequent. Tinan quickly become their \\"young cadet\\", Lautrec illustrating the cover of his novel L'Example de Ninon de Lenclos amoureuse, published in May, 1898. Dethomas introduced Tinan to Augustine Bulteau, and she “took charge” of the young writer, guiding him as she had Maxime years before. It was to her Venice estate that Tinan retreated during the final harrowing moths of his short life. A failing heart did not keep him from his work, though his final “sentimental little story” remained unfinished at the time of his death on November 18, 1898. Aimienne, ou le détournement de mineure, was published posthumously; Tinan’s final act was to dedicate the unfinished novel to Dethomas, as a “testimony of his deep affection.” As had Lautrec at the beginning of the year, Dethomas contributed lithographs to the publication which adorn the cover - his first such foray into the world of literature and a fitting tribute to his dear friend.Frey, p.440; Milhou 1991, p.77-83  Ignacio Zuloaga  Ignacio Zuloaga and his wife Valentine Dethomas (c. 1900). The couple married May 18, 1899. Arriving in Paris at the end of 1889 after a disappointing stay in Rome, the young Basque painter Ignacio Zuloaga first met Maxime Dethomas as a fellow student at the studio of Henri Gervex.Boone, p.179 They shared a deep admiration for Degas and Carrière, and would both later study under Carrière at the Académie de La Palette. More hungry for recognition and success than Dethomas, Zuloaga exhibited enthusiastically at the Salon des Artistes Français, the Barc de Boutteville, the Salon des Indépendants, and the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Fame, however, did not come quickly. Disappointed, he returned to Andalusia, where he intended to renew his inspiration and craft a new artistic vision - one which would appease the fickle tastes of the Paris art community. By rare chance, Zuloaga and Dethomas ran into each other in Seville, a meeting that proved fortuitous for Zuloaga. Since his return to Spain, he had battled disappointment and poverty, but knew that if he could return again to Paris, he would surely find success. San Telmo Museoa, Spain Dethomas' joy at finding his old Montmartre companion under such circumstances soon turned to sadness as Zuloaga explained his dire financial straits and his desperation to return to Paris to revive his artistic career. The seemingly intractable problems of a well-discouraged Ignacio were at once alleviated with a generous offer: \\"My workshop will be yours as much as it takes. Come to Paris. It's at 9 rue Duperré. Models, I'll find you. Home.\\"Milhou 1991, p.101 The difficulties thus managed by the goodwill of Maxime, Ignacio returned to Paris in 1894. Presented to Mrs. Marie-Louise Dethomas, mother of Maxime's half-sisters Valentine, Germaine and Alice, Zuloaga was asked to make a portrait of the eldest. This portrait of Valentine would perhaps mark the moment at which their romance was kindled. Countess Mathieu de Noailles: Ignacio Zuloaga (1913) Before the end of 1894, as he did for all his interesting friends, Maxime presented Zuloaga at the salon of Madame Augustine Bulteau. Her considerable reach within the arts community would smooth his path to recognition and ultimately lead to several commissions from her network of expatriate Spanish-speaking habitues, most notably, the 1913 portrait of the writer Anna de Noailles, which would stand as one of Zuloaga's most important works. On May 18, 1899, in Saint-Philippe- du-Roule, Ignacio Zuloaga, to whom success has just smiled at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, married Valentine Dethomas, with Eugène Carrière and Isaac Albéniz as witnesses. From a friendship born under the auspices of painting; re-invigorated by chance; and nourished by unbridled generosity; the family ties were thus consolidated between the two artists. For the next three decades the pair would stay firm friends.Milhou 1991, p.100-102  Pierre Louys  Marie-Louise Thierrée, step-mother of Maxime Dethomas (c. 1898) The author Pierre Louys was also a close companion of Dethomas and had collaborated with him on the first edition of Le Centaure in 1896. During August and September, 1898, Dethomas acted as a marriage broker of sorts, attempting to bring together his half-sister Germaine and Louys, a plot that was thwarted by Maxime's stepmother, Marie-Louise Thierrée.Neideraruer, p.71-73  Marcel Proust  Dethomas had a number of prominent writer- friends, one of which was Marcel Proust. Proust made a glowing mention of Dethomas' landscapes of Venice in The Sweet Cheat Gone and discussed the quality of his work after attending an exhibition held at Galerie Durand- Ruel.Carter, p.337 In a March, 1903 letter to Dethomas, Proust wrote that after having seen his exhibition, he received \\"a profound initiation to the understanding of nature and love of life.\\" He continued, \\"it seems that one has gotten from you new eyes to look at life and men and even down to those little windows on the Grand Canal that I would love to juxtapose with yours.\\"Bucknall, p.178  Exhibitions  Poster designed by Maxime Dethomas and printed by Auguste Clot for the thirteenth Impressionists and Symbolists exhibition at the Barc de Bouttville, opening December 26, 1896.

Whilst he had been visiting Venice each winter for several years, and accumulating a considerable portfolio of work in the process, the collaboration with Regnier for this project uniquely combined previously completed stand-alone coloured artworks, and a suite of black and white sketches in charcoal and conté explicitly intended for use 'in-text'.Milhou 1991, p.105-106 In conjunction with the release of the book, Dethomas held an exhibition of the book's artworks at the Galerie de l'Art Decoratif, which was both a popular and critical success.Milhou 1991, p.271 Dethomas' bold xylographic style lent itself well to the woodcut lithographic process, and the in-text illustrations in Esquisses Vénitiennes set a standard by which Dethomas' subsequent illustration projects would follow. Employing the skills of engravers such as Léon Pichon and Emile Gasperini, his black and white drawings found their way into sitting rooms and libraries around the world.

B. White, produced by Hanna- Barbera Productions and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film, like the book, is about a pig named Wilbur who befriends an intelligent spider named Charlotte who saves him from being slaughtered. The film was directed by Charles A. Nichols and Iwao Takamoto from a story by Earl Hamner Jr., and features the voices of Debbie Reynolds, Paul Lynde, and Henry Gibson, alongside narration by Rex Allen. Charlotte's Web also features a song score of music and lyrics written by the Sherman Brothers, who had previously written music for family films like Mary Poppins (1964), The Jungle Book (1967), and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968). Charlotte's Web premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on February 22, 1973, and was released on March 1 to moderate critical and commercial success. It was the first of only three Hanna-Barbera films not to be based upon one of their famous television cartoons, Heidi's Song (1982) and Once Upon a Forest (1993) being the other two. Plot Early one morning, Fern Arable prevents her father John from slaughtering a piglet as the runt of the litter. Deciding to let Fern deal with nurturing the piglet, John allows Fern to raise it as a pet. She nurtures it lovingly, naming it Wilbur. Six weeks later, Wilbur, due to being a spring pig, has matured, and John tells Fern that Wilbur has to be sold (his siblings were already sold). Fern sadly says good-bye to Wilbur as he is sold down the street to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman. At Homer's farm, a goose coaxes a sullen Wilbur to speak his first words. Although delighted at this new ability, Wilbur still yearns for companionship. He attempts to get the goose to play with him, but she declines on the condition that she has to hatch her eggs. Wilbur also tries asking a rat named Templeton to play with him, but Templeton's only interests are spying, hiding, and eating. Wilbur then wants to play with a lamb, but the lamb's father says sheep do not play with pigs because it is only a matter of time before they are slaughtered and turned into smoked bacon and ham. Horrified at this depressing discovery, Wilbur reduces himself to tears until a mysterious voice tells him to \\"chin up\\", and wait until morning to reveal herself to him. The following morning, she reveals herself to be a spider named Charlotte A. Cavatica, living on a web on a corner of Homer's barn overlooking Wilbur's pig pen. She tells him that she will come up with a plan guaranteed to spare his life. Later, the goose's goslings hatch. One of them, named Jeffrey, befriends Wilbur. Eventually, Charlotte reveals her plan to \\"play a trick on Zuckerman\\", and consoles Wilbur to sleep. The next morning, Homer's farmhand, Lurvy, sees the words, SOME PIG, spun within Charlotte's web. The incident attracts publicity among Homer's neighbors who deem the praise to be a miracle. The publicity eventually dies down, and Charlotte requests the barn animals to devise a new word to spin within her web. After several suggestions, the goose suggests the phrase, TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC!, though Charlotte decides to shorten it to one TERRIFIC. The incident becomes another media sensation, though Homer still desires to slaughter Wilbur. For the next message, Charlotte then employs Templeton to pull a word from a magazine clipping at the dump for inspiration, in which he returns the word RADIANT ripped from a soap box to spin within her web. Following this, Homer decides to enter Wilbur in the county fair for the summer. Charlotte reluctantly decides to accompany him, though Templeton at first has no interest in doing so until the goose tells him about all the food there. After one night there, Charlotte sends Templeton to the trash pile on another errand to gather another word for her next message, in which he returns with the word, HUMBLE. The next morning, Wilbur awakens to find Charlotte has spun an egg sac containing her unborn offspring, and the following afternoon, the word, HUMBLE, is spun. However, Fern's brother, Avery, discovers another pig named Uncle has won first place, though the county fair staff decides to hold a celebration in honor of Homer's miraculous pig, and rewards him $25 and a gold medal. He then announces that he will allow Wilbur to \\"live to a ripe old age\\". Exhausted from laying eggs and writing words, Charlotte tells Wilbur she will remain at the fair to die. Not willing to let her children be abandoned, Wilbur has Templeton retrieve her egg sac to take back to the farm, just before she dies. Once he returns to Homer's farm, he guards the egg sac until the winter. The next spring, Charlotte's 514 children are hatched, but leave the farm, causing Wilbur to become saddened to the point of wanting to run away. Just as he is about to do so, the ram points out that three of them did not fly away. Pleased at finding new friends, he names them Joy, Nellie, and Aranea, but as much as he loves them, they will never replace the memory of Charlotte. Voice cast * Henry Gibson as Wilbur, a pig who was almost killed due to being a runt. Over time, however, he grows so much that one would never have known he was once a runt. When he learns of his fate of being slaughtered, Wilbur instantly breaks down into tears, until Charlotte tells him that she will do whatever it takes to save him. Wilbur is a friendly pig, but also prone to anxiety. * Debbie Reynolds as Charlotte A. Cavatica, a spider who lives on a web in a corner of Homer's barn above Wilbur's pig pen. She is very loving and motherly, but sometimes grows frustrated at Wilbur's anxiety issues. At the end of the film, she dies after laying 514 eggs, but three of them decide to stay with Wilbur. * Paul Lynde as Templeton, a care-free, gluttonous and egotistical rat who lives at Homer's farm. He helps Charlotte get new ideas for her webs on the condition that he is promised food. At the end of the film, as well as the sequel, he has four bratty children of his own: Henrietta, Lester, Ralphie, and Junior. * Agnes Moorehead as the Goose, an unnamed goose who is the one that encourages Wilbur to speak for the first time. Her seven goslings later hatch, although there were actually eight eggs (one was rotten). In the sequel, she was named Gwen. * Don Messick as Jeffrey, a young, undersized gosling whom Wilbur befriends shortly after his birth. He initially lives, eats, and sleeps with Wilbur rather than his mother and siblings. At one point, Avery remarks that he sounds more like a pig than a gosling, which pleases Jeffrey. When Wilbur is loaded into a crate destined for the fair, Jeffrey casually walks in to join him, amusing the humans but they still remove and restrain him nevertheless. International VHS releases show a deleted scene in which Jeffrey is briefly seen riding with Avery in the back of the Arables' truck, until it stops so Avery can set him down in the middle of the road. Distressed at being separated from Wilbur, Jeffrey tries to catch up with the truck to no avail, leaving him heartbroken. His mother gently directs him to the pond to join his siblings. Despite his previous insistence that they be friends forever, Jeffrey does not reunite with Wilbur when the latter returns from the fair nor does he appear in the rest of the film. * Herb Vigran as Lurvy, Homer's farmhand who is the first to notice the messages in Charlotte's webs. * Pamelyn Ferdin as Fern Arable, John's daughter who convinces him to spare Wilbur's life. * Martha Scott as Mrs. Arable, Fern's mother who first tells her of what was going to happen to Wilbur. * Bob Holt as Homer Zuckerman, Mrs. Arable's brother and Fern's uncle. * John Stephenson as John Arable, Fern's father. He was about to \\"do away\\" with Wilbur until she intervened. * Danny Bonaduce as Avery Arable, Fern's older brother. * William B. White as Henry Fussy, a boy of about Fern's age, whom she soon starts spending time with while Wilbur is at the fair. * Dave Madden as the Ram, one of the first animals Wilbur meets at Homer's farm. He is the first to tell Wilbur that it is a pig's fate to be slaughtered and turned into smoked bacon and ham. Madden also voiced other characters in the film. * Joan Gerber as Edith Zuckerman, Homer's wife. She comes up with the idea of giving Wilbur a buttermilk bath. Gerber also voiced Mrs. Fussy, Henry's stern mother who never lets him have fun. * Rex Allen as the Narrator Notes Five members of the cast (Henry Gibson, Paul Lynde, Agnes Moorehead, Danny Bonaduce, and Dave Madden) had previously appeared on the ABC television sitcom Bewitched (1964-1972). Hanna-Barbera also animated the opening credits of the show. However, Bonaduce and Madden are better known for their roles on another ABC- TV sitcom, The Partridge Family (1970–1974), which was still in production when the film was made. Ferdin and Lynde also both appeared on The Paul Lynde Show, another ABC sitcom created to fill the contract of Bewitched. Bonaduce, Lynde, Gerber, Messick, and Stephenson had previously worked for Hanna-Barbera in their television shows: Lynde appeared in The Perils of Penelope Pitstop (uncredited), Bonaduce and Gerber were stars in Partridge Family 2200 A.D., and Stephenson and Messick were Hanna-Barbera regulars who regularly lent their voices to many of their shows. Production In 1967, animators John and Faith Hubley were interested to purchase the film rights of Charlotte's Web in hopes of producing a feature-length animated adaptation. E.B. White, who had liked the Hubleys, sold the film rights, but the Hubleys were unable to acquire financial backing and the project languished. In September 1970, the Los Angeles Times reported that White had sold the film rights to Charlotte's Web to Edgar Bronfman Sr.'s Sagittarius Productions who intended to produce a feature-length animated adaptation of the book. Director-producer Michael Campus was hired to supervise the project. Later, in November, Henry White, president of Sagittarius Pictures, and Campus approached director Gene Deitch to direct Charlotte's Web. Deitch agreed and personally met with E.B. White to discuss how the book should be adapted. As part of the contract deal with E.B. White, he would have the final approval of the character design and the casting of the spider character, Charlotte. However, Campus left the project to direct Z.P.G. (1972), and Deitch later learned he was forbidden to show his storyboards to E.B. White. Development on the film still continued at Deitch's animation studio in Prague with Czech painter Mirko Hanák producing artwork of the film before dying of leukemia in November 1971. However, Bronfman Sr. began to grow dissatisfied with the European-influenced conceptual artwork. By May 1971, Deitch shipped his storyboards in a package to Sagittarius Productions in New York City, whom notified that his package went unopened and would be returned to him. On June 3, 1971, Deitch, in a mailed letter to E.B. White, stated that Sagittarius had refused to look his storyboards following six months of work on the project. That same month, it was reported that Sagittarius Productions had signed a two-picture production deal with Hanna-Barbera Productions in which both films would be distributed by Paramount Pictures; one of the films being Charlotte's Web. Around that same time, Joe Barbera had visited White at his residence in Maine, in which the author highlighted parts of the book he did not want to change, and parts that were \\"subject to discussion.\\" Casting In January 1972, it was reported that Henry Gibson, Debbie Reynolds, and Tony Randall had signed on to provide the voices of Wilbur, Charlotte, and Templeton. Writing in his autobiography, Barbera wrote that Reynolds had called him and said that she was willing to join the project even without being paid. Although Randall had completed all of his voicework, co-director Iwao Takamoto wrote that \\"his readings just went flat, which surprised all of us. Tony's delivery was a bit too sophisticated and his singing was too operatic. He did not have enough of that raunchy feeling that the character required.\\" Barbera felt Randall had to be replaced, and approached Paul Lynde, who was voicing characters in The Perils of Penelope Pitstop and other Hanna-Barbera TV shows at the time, to do a reading. Lynde was officially cast in the following spring, which was followed by Agnes Moorehead, Rex Allen, Pamelyn Ferdin, and Martha Scott who had joined the cast. Release Charlotte's Web was originally slated to be released during the summer of 1972, but by September 1972, its release was pushed back to early 1973.

It was also released in West Germany on March 30, 1973, as well as August 11 in Sweden, August 25 in Japan, and September 4, 1981, in Australia. The film was first released on VHS in 1979, followed by three more re-releases in 1988, 1993, and 1996.

A second DVD release of the film was released in 2006. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times described the music and visuals as \\"exceedingly uninteresting,\\" but noted that the screenplay \\"has followed the original so closely that it's still possible to be moved by the story.\\" Variety called the film \\"heartwarming entertainment\\" with \\"imaginative and clever\\" animation. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four, writing that although \\"the animation style is television-quickie (bland, static backgrounds), White's story is so blessed nice it is doubtful that anyone or anything could ruin it.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"No one, I think, could ask for a more respectful treatment of a classic ... The grownups will miss some of the artful appeal the book has, but can settle gladly enough for a cheerful and enthusiastic piece of children's fare.\\"Champlin, Charles (April 11, 1973). \\"'Web' Spins Tale for Children, Adults\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1, 16. In a negative review for The Monthly Film Bulletin, Clyde Jeavons criticized the animation as \\"stiff, basic and two-dimensional\\" and the music as lacking \\"that instant catchiness which has always been a successful feature of Walt Disney's cartoon melodies. But the saddest thing of all is to see E. B. White's celebrated fantasy reduced to such plodding blandness in defiance of its rich potential.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that it has a 76% approval rating based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 6.6/10. The critical consensus reads; \\"That's some pig, with spirited vocal performances and a charmingly family-friendly adaptation of E.B. White's winsome story spun around him.\\" Among retrospective reviews, Craig Butler of All-Movie Guide criticized the animation and the musical score, but called it a faithful adaptation, noting that \\"no attempt has been made to soften the existential sadness at the story's core\\". Dan Jardine criticized the songs and the \\"Saturday morning cartoon quality\\" of the animation, but also says that Hamner \\"retains just enough of White’s elegant prose in the dialogue and narration to keep the film from being simply a painfully well-intended experiment.\\" Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com stated that the animation is sometimes \\"downright bad\\", but that White's classic fable needs little to make it come to life. TV Guide reviewed the film with generally positive remarks, stating that \\"The voices of Reynolds, Lynde, Gibson, and all the rest are perfectly cast, and the songs by the Sherman brothers are solid, although none of them became hits like those they wrote for such Disney movies as MARY POPPINS.\\" When it was reissued on DVD it was awarded an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award. E.B. White's reaction Despite assisting in helping keep parts of the story, White was still very displeased with the adaptation. According to Gene Deitch, White wrote in a 1977 letter, \\"We have never ceased to regret that your version of 'Charlotte's Web' never got made. The Hanna-Barbera version has never pleased either of us ... a travesty ...\\" White himself wrote of the film, \\"The story is interrupted every few minutes so that somebody can sing a jolly song. I don't care much for jolly songs. The Blue Hill Fair, which I tried to report faithfully in the book, has become a Disney World, with 76 trombones. But that's what you get for getting embroiled in Hollywood.\\" White had previously turned down Disney when they offered to make a film based on his book. According to the film's writer, Earl Hamner Jr., White's wife — who sometimes offered advice and suggestions to the filmmakers — would have preferred the music of Mozart in the film, rather than the music of the Sherman Brothers. Legacy The film has developed a devoted following over the following years due to television and VHS; in 1994 it surprised the marketplace by becoming one of the best-selling titles of the year, 21 years after its first premiere. No other non-Disney musical animated film has enjoyed such a comeback in popularity, prompting a direct-to-video sequel, Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure, which Paramount released in the US on March 18, 2003 (Universal released it internationally and, through Universal Cartoon Studios, also animated it), followed by a live-action film version (co-produced by Nickelodeon Movies) of the original story, which was released on December 15, 2006. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Animation Film Sequel A direct-to- video sequel titled Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure was released in 2003, co-produced by Nickelodeon and co-distributed by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. The sequel centers on Wilbur's relationship with a lonely lamb named Cardigan and also shows Charlotte's children as adolescents. Reviews for the sequel were generally unfavorable, with critics panning its animation and plot. Soundtrack # \\"There Must Be Something More\\" # \\"I Can Talk!\\" # \\"Chin Up!\\" # \\"We've Got Lots in Common\\" # \\"Deep in the Dark/Charlotte's Web\\" # \\"Mother Earth and Father Time\\" # \\"A Veritable Smorgasbord\\" # \\"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\\" \\"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\\" \\"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\\" is the title that saves Wilbur from being slaughtered in the story. It is the theme of the finale song in the film. It was written by the Sherman Brothers and arranged as a barbershop quartet by Irwin Kostal, in keeping with the time and place of the story. It was covered by the Brady Kids and was chosen for release on their first single taken from The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album by producer Jackie Mills. 2018 CD Release In March 2018 the Original Cast Soundtrack was released on CD by the Varèse Sarabande record label. This is the first time the soundtrack had enjoyed any re-release (digitally or otherwise) since its original pressing.

The film stars Barbara Steele and Peter Baldwin. Other titles for the film include The Spectre and Lo Spettro del Dr. Hichcock.Flavia Brizio-Skov, Popular Italian Cinema: Culture and Politics in a Postwar Society, IB Tauris 2011  Plot  In 1910 in Scotland, the ailing Doctor Hichcock (Elio Jotta), confined to his wheelchair, presides over seances in which his housekeeper, Catherine (Harriet Medin), acts as the medium. According to Hichcock's theory, shots of lethal poison followed shortly after by an antidote could cure his physical disability. The younger Doctor Livingstone (Peter Baldwin) stays with him in the house to regularly administer this dangerous treatment. Hichcock's wife Margaret (Barbara Steele) finds living with her husband increasingly unbearable. Possibly suspected by her husband, she is having an affair with Livingstone. She implores him to murder Hichcock, which he eventually does by injecting the poison but not administering the antidote. During the distribution of Hichcock's estate, Margaret and Livingstone learn Hichcock only recently changed his last will and testament. Margaret gets the house and its contents, but only a third share of her husband's bonds, shares, currency and jewels, which are kept in the doctor's safe. Upon Catherine telling them that the key to the safe containing the valuables was in the jacket buried with him, they secretly visit his vault, open his coffin and retrieve it, intending to take a larger share of the valuables. Livingstone opens the safe while Margaret is out of the room with Catherine. It is empty. Later, they hear Hichcock's voice calling to them and experience other poltergeist phenomena, including the appearance of the ghost-like Hichcock himself. One night, Catherine, apparently possessed by Hichcock, speaks in his voice and tells Margaret that his valuables are buried beneath his coffin. She returns to the vault to find a golden box. Upon opening it, she cuts herself. The box contains nothing but a skull. Catherine then insinuates that Livingstone took the valuables for himself when he opened the safe in Margaret's absence. Margaret finds jewels in his bag, much to Livingstone's surprise. Margaret slashes him to death with a razor and drags him into the cellar where she uses kerosene from a lamp to burn his body. Margaret is drawn to Hichcock's study by the ringing of his handbell, where she contemplates suicide by poison, pours it into a glass of gin, but does not drink it. She starts feeling ill and sits down when Hichcock appears, alive and no longer disabled. He tells her that he poisoned the box with a non-lethal dose of curare, which is now quickly paralyzing her. Hichcock shoots his accomplice Catherine dead and makes Margaret touch the gun to incriminate her. Finally, he toasts Margaret's ill health with the glass of gin she poured for herself, and drinks it. When he realizes it is poisoned, he begs Margaret for the antidote. She laughs and destroys the vial of antidote. Hichcock seals himself inside a secret room behind the bookshelf, locking himself in. The police arrive and arrest the laughing and paralyzed Margaret for Catherine's murder, carrying her out of the room. When Canon Owens, the parish priest, arrives and hears muffled noises from behind the library bookshelf, he addresses Hichcock's portrait with the words, \\"I told you, Doctor Hichcock, the devil is a very real person.\\" He then leaves the room. Production The Ghost was shot in Rome. It is a Gothic re-imagining of the film Les Diaboliques (1955). The Italian production crew are credited by aliases. The music score is credited to \\"Franck Wallace\\", whom Italian magazine Bianco e Nero and the Monthly Film Bulletin claim is a pseudonym for Franco Mannino. When Beat Records re- released the score, they found the tapes credited to Francesco De Masi who is not credited in the film. Riccardo Freda had directed Barbara Steele in the horror film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock the previous year. In that film Steele's character was also married to a Doctor Hichcock, but neither character had any connection with those in The Ghost. Release The Ghost was released in Italy on March 30, 1963, where it was distributed by Dino de Laurentiis. The film grossed a total of ₤175 million lira on its theatrical release. Freda said that the censors did not object to any of the film's content. The film was later released in the United Kingdom in February 1964John Hamilton, Beasts in the Cellar: The Exploitation Film Career of Tony Tenser, FAB Press 2005 and in the United States on February 18, 1965 in Dallas.  Critical reception  In a contemporary review, The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that \\"Pictorially the film is a knock-out\\" while the dubbed dialogue is \\"more inept than ever\\". The review concluded that The Ghost was \\"a splendid exercise in Grand Guignol\\" Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars complimenting the film's atmosphere, calling it a \\"Measured, moody horror, let down by routine plot\\".

It came out for PC in Japan in 2000 and was ported for DVD in 2001 and for PS2 in 2003. It was distributed in America as an AnimePlay DVD title in 2002. The story can take either a dark action/drama path or can turn into a romantic drama depending on the choice of the player. A remake for the Xbox 360 console was released in 2012 and ported on PC in 2013. Plot Phantom is an interactive (choose your own adventure) video game and its adaptations: a three-part OVA anime series, a 26-episode TV anime, and a three volume manga.  Video game  Phantom of Inferno details the life of a 15-year-old Japanese boy who is kidnapped after witnessing the killing of a reporter. The memories of his past life are erased, and he is given the choice to join 'Inferno' or die. After joining the organization he is given the name 'Zwei' (German for number 'two') and will study under 'Ein' (From the German word \\"Eins\\" for 'one'). Ein is also known as 'Phantom', the title given to the organization's top assassin. Inferno is said to be the 'United Nations of crime syndicates'. As Zwei makes his way through training and various missions, deceit and betrayal occur even within Inferno and slowly put Zwei in increasing danger. Along the way, Zwei meets a girl by the name of Cal Devens and, though he tries to protect her, she too is drawn into Inferno to become the assassin, Drei (German for 'three'). The game is divided into three chapters. The first chapter deals with Zwei being turned into a killer and has two main \\"routes\\" to follow, the Ein route and the Claudia route. No matter which route is chosen, the chapter ends with Scythe escaping and Ein presumably dead, unless one opts to escape back to Japan. The second chapter starts off one year after the events in the first chapter, and deals with Claudia's plan to bring the Godoh group into the organization, Scythe's revenge, and the introduction of a new character, Cal Devens. It contains the Cal route and the final Claudia route. A DVD version with added voice acting, but with removed sex scenes was released on October 26, 2001. A port to the PlayStation 2, based on the DVD version was released on May 22, 2003. Phantom Integration, an updated PC version with a new ending, but without voice acting, like the original PC release, was released on September 17, 2004. In 2010, Nitroplus announced the game will be remade for the Xbox 360 featuring the same scenario but based on the designs created for the anime series from Bee Train. Character designs from artists Minkao Shiba, Yoko Kikuchi, Tomoaki Kado, Yoshimitsu Yamashita, and Yoshiaki Tsubata were introduced into the 360 version. In addition to the design adaptations, the cast of the anime series also reprised their roles for the newer/updated version. It was originally planned for a Winter 2011 release, but was delayed due to unforeseen complications. The game was released on October 25, 2012 and ported on PC on August 30, 2013. =DVD version = The DVD version of the game was translated to English and distributed by Hirameki International on September 10, 2002. The game can be difficult to play on a PC, as many media players will not display the video and subtitles properly or at all. Two known media players that do work include VLC and PowerDVD. VLC will run with no problems, allowing the player to fast forward scenes with the slider bar, but the password system will give the player a blank screen if the player attempts to use it. PowerDVD will run fine as well, but sometimes it will not let the player to use the slider bar to fast forward scenes, which can make it more time-consuming to replay the game and obtain different endings. PowerDVD also has a working fast-forward option, however it can cause the game to freeze up and stop responding at certain scenes. The DVD version removed the save/load system from the PC version, replacing it with a password system to jump to selected points in the story. The CG gallery was also removed in porting, and there is no way to go back and re-read the text in previous scenes. The English subtitles suffer from various quality issues, such as a large amount of typo or grammar mistakes, liberal translations, and sometimes fail to show up at certain points in the story. One particular instance has the character Cal say \\"Thanks\\" in the English subtitles, at a time when Zwei is asking about her age.  OVA - Phantom: The Animation  The OVA series follows Zwei as he makes a trip to America, only to witness an assassination that leads to his memory loss and indoctrination into Inferno. Though not as heavily as in the game, we see Zwei's training before he goes with Ein to help with an assassination. While a different path is taken, deceit and betrayal rip apart Inferno and place Ein and Zwei on opposite sides, which eventually leads to a climactic battle between them at the end of the anime.  Anime series  Nitroplus and Kadokawa Shoten have adapted the story into an anime series produced by Bee Train under the direction of Koichi Mashimo, titled Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. Staff members include writer Yosuke Kuroda, who co- wrote and supervised the scripts from the staff writers Gen Urobuchi, Hideki Shirane, Noboru Kimura, Tatsuya Takahashi, and Yukihito Nonaka and designed by Bee Train artists Yoshimitsu Yamashita, Mutsumi Sasaki, Minako Shiba, Yoshiaki Tsubata, Tomoaki Kado, and Yoko Kikuchi. The series features music by Hikaru Nanase and theme songs by Kokia and Ali Project. The series went on air on April 2, 2009 and ended its run on September 24, 2009 on TV Tokyo. Subsequently, the show also airs on AT-X, TV Aichi, and TV Osaka. The anime series is now available for internet streaming by FUNimation Entertainment. The complete series was released in English on two DVD sets January 18, 2011. The series made its North American television debut on February 8, 2010 on the Funimation Channel. Characters * (Reiji Azuma 吾妻 玲二) : The title character of the story, Zwei was a perfectly ordinary tourist from Japan, before witnessing an Inferno assassination in America and being kidnapped. He was able to elude his pursuers long enough for them to realize he had a natural survival instinct that was perfect for an assassin. He had his memory erased through a combination of drugs and hypnotherapy, and thus became the second generation Phantom. The name Zwei is simply a code name to show he is the second experimental assassin created by Scythe Master. Through Claudia, one of the three top executives of Inferno, Zwei is able to learn his true identity as Reiji Azuma. When he returns to Japan, he goes back to using this name. When his killing intent shows, in the anime, his eyes turn green with orange in the center. :Game: :OVA: :Anime: * (Elen) : An assassin with such skill she was given the codename \\"Phantom\\", a designation given only to the best killer in Inferno. She was found by Scythe Master and was his first test subject to be given his assassin-processing treatment. She has no memories of her past and is incredibly apathetic. When she escapes to Japan, she changes her name to Elen and claims to be Reiji's twin sister Eren Azuma (吾妻 江蓮). A long and rigorous investigation by her and Reiji traces her history back to Ulan Bator, Mongolia, and though the trail ends there, Elen is able to find some peace in the area. In the OVA, she is shown to have an older brother, and it is suggested the village where she lived was massacred. Her name is erroneously spelled and sometimes pronounced as \\"Eren\\" in the anime. In the game, it is spelt and pronounced \\"Elen\\". :Game: :OVA: :Anime: *'''''' : A beautiful executive of Inferno who is quick to befriend and manipulate Zwei. Though she seems to have good intentions, she is quietly manipulating Inferno and its actions. This cunning and double sided nature is never shown in the OVA. :Game: :OVA: :Anime: *'''''' : Claudia's loyal childhood friend and bodyguard. :Game: :OVA: :Anime: * (Helmut von Giuseppe) : A scientist with sadistic delusions of grandeur. He is the creator of Ein, Zwei, Drei, and the members of the Zahlenschwestern. He is referred to as Master Scythe in the OVA dub. :Game: :OVA: :Anime: *'''''' : A brutal executive of Inferno, and leader of the Los Angeles gang, the \\"Bloodies\\". :OVA: :Anime: *'''''' : A quiet and calculating Colombian drug lord who other executives of Inferno are quick to obey. His family name is erroneously spelled \\"McGwire\\" in the OVA and the anime. :OVA: :Anime: * (藤枝 美緒) : A young girl who is unaware that her father is a boss in the yakuza. Reiji goes to her high school when he and Elen escape back to Japan. Mio soon finds herself developing feelings for him. :Game: :Anime: * (Cal Devens) : A young girl that tried to hire Zwei, thinking he was a killer for justice, by using money she had unknowingly stolen from Inferno. Zwei tries to hide her from Inferno but is unsuccessful and in a move to save her life asks that she becomes his assistant as he had been to Ein. After an attempt on his life, Zwei took her for dead and was forced to leave America to go into hiding. Cal believed that she had been left behind by Zwei and was manipulated by an exonerated Scythe, who turned her beliefs into full hatred for Zwei and trained her as his third assassin, Drei. Her clothing and situation-teenaged girl trying to hire an assassin to avenge her murdered sibling, beginning to fall in love with said assassin, and learning the art of killing herself-are very similar to those of the character Mathilda from the film Léon. In the anime she is a fan of old films. Her method of dueling, waiting until the music from the pocket-watch Reiji gave her has stopped, is a reference to For a Few Dollars More. :Game: :Anime: *'''''' : Six girls who all went through Scythe Master's finalized assassin creation process. They are nearly the same quality of killers as the first three, and took nowhere near as much time to train since the process to make them was based on all the original three's data. They all wear white carnival masks (similar to ones Zwei and Ein wear during one of their missions at one point) and are named: Vier, Fünf, Sechs, Sieben, Acht and Neun. \\"Zahlenschwestern\\" appropriately means \\"Number Sisters.\\"  Routes  Unlike standard visual novels where you usually focus on a single girl near the start and delve more into her story, the story is much more interleaved in Phantom of Inferno. The game is divided into 3 chapters, and each chapter has different routes which will affect the sequence of events, as well as vary the scenes and endings that you will get.  Chapter 1  Ein's route = To get on Ein's route, simply think about her on the first night, and call to her on the night of the final test. After returning from the body guard assignment, save Ein, do not let her go, and console her in the motel room. At the final confrontation at the compound, Reiji will attempt to shoot Scythe, but Ein jumps into the way, taking the bullet for him. Scythe then escapes. = Claudia's route = To get on Claudia's route, the player must learn to drive the F40 and sleep with Claudia during the body guard assignment. The player must also choose to save Ein, but instead, plan to return to Inferno. During the final confrontation at the compound, Reiji will be shot at by an unknown sniper and both will play a game of cat and mouse to try and discover each other's position. Seeing someone's shadow behind him, Reiji turns and fires, hitting Ein, who had not fired even though she had gotten the drop on Reiji. Scythe then shoots Reiji and is about to finish him off when Lizzie arrives and saves his life. Scythe still manages to escape however.  Chapter 2  The events in chapter 2 will be decided by whose route the player took in chapter 1, as well as whether you partially or completely finished them. Cal's path is necessary for several of the chapter 2 endings. = Cal's route = Cal's route is very strict because a single deviation will cause the game to treat it as if the player had never met Cal in the first place. Generally speaking, all the options in Cal's route will be \\"Cal or something else\\", and the player must pick the Cal-related option (such as going shopping with her). If the player turn her down once, or simply choose to not trust her at the beginning, then the story immediately assumes that you never met her in the first place, which, depending on the player’s decisions, may seem rather odd (Choosing not to go shopping with Cal for instance, completely removes her appearance from any further scenes, almost as if she went shopping but never came back). The exception is if the player chose not to accept Cal's confession, in which case she will still show up in the game afterwards. However the player will not be able to get the Southbound ending and will be relegated to a dead end where Ein shoots the player in the desert warehouse. If the player completed Claudia's path in chapter 1 and start on Cal's path in chapter 2, then the player will have to pick which path you wish to complete. The player will have the option to go to Claudia's house (which will put you on Claudia's route in chapter 2) or not (Cal's route). = Ein's Route = Getting to chapter three may be tricky, since it requires a specific set of circumstances. The player must have completed both Ein and Cal's paths, confirmed the sniper's identity, and discovered the identity of the attackers at the harbor. After the loft is bombed, The player must \\"Hide\\". After this the player will meet up with Ein at the warehouse and escape southwards. However, Cal is still alive and thinks that Reiji lied to her. She is then discovered by Scythe, who encourages this belief, and which will form one of the crucial plot points of chapter three.  Endings  According to the official PS2 game guidebook, the endings are as follows:  Chapter 1  The Endless Nightmare: Reiji successfully escapes back to Japan and resumes his normal, everyday life with his family. One day, he catches a glimpse of Ein amidst a crowd, apparently having survived and presumably sent to terminate him. However, Reiji isn't completely sure what he saw was real or just a figment of his imagination, for he now feels as if he is living in a dream and can't get rid of his fear that he will wake up to the \\"real world\\" where he is an assassin.  Chapter 2  The End of a Long Dream: To get this ending, the player must do Claudia's path in chapter 1 and 2, but not meet Cal, and then do not shoot Lizzie when she draws her gun. Reiji then goes to the warehouse in the desert and waits for Ein to find and kill him, which she does, lamenting his death and the scar in her heart. Southbound: To get this ending, the player must complete Ein's path in chapter 1 but not fully complete Cal's path in chapter 2, and must also identify the sniper and attackers at the harbor. Reiji goes to the warehouse in the desert and waits for Ein to kill him, but Ein asks Reiji to kill her instead, as Scythe has no more use for her and she sees no other purpose in her life. Neither is able to kill the other, and finally they vow to head south this time to start a new life together (having headed north on their failed attempt to run away from Inferno in chapter 1). This can be considered Ein's happy ending, and is more or less the same as the path to chapter 3, but since Reiji has no complete relationship with Cal, the two of them simply head south to start a new life together. Fugitives: This ending requires the player to follow the full Cal path in chapter 2 but NOT finish Ein's path in chapter 1 or Claudia's path in chapter 2. After the loft is bombed, the player must select to \\"Hide\\". After this Cal will arrive back from her shopping trip and Reiji vows to escape with her and start a new life together. Vengeful Spirits: This ending requires the player to follow the full Cal path in Chapter 2. After the loft is bombed, the player should select the option to \\"Kill everyone\\". Reiji goes berserk and storms Inferno HQ, killing over 20 men and McGuire in the process before dying of multiple wounds, as he believes Inferno has taken Cal away from him. However, Cal was not in the apartment during the explosion. She waits faithfully for him to return as he promised to, finally accusing him of lying to her after the third morning. At this point, the alternative option \\"Hide\\" simply causes Reiji to go hide at the warehouse in the desert and wait for Ein to kill him, which she does not do. Instead the two flee to Japan; progressing the game from Chapter 2 to Chapter 3. It is nearly identical to \\"The End of the Long Dream\\" ending. From Atop the Hill: There are two variations of this ending. Both require the player to finish Claudia's route in chapter 1 and 2 completely and finish off by selecting \\"Shoot Claudia\\" at the hangar. One version requires the player not to have met Cal or broken off the relationship early on, and the other requires the player to have gone as far with the Cal route as possible in addition to Claudia's route. Reiji remembers that he vowed to survive at all costs, and shoots Claudia at the hangar, bringing her body and the disk back to Inferno. Five years later, Inferno has united all the underworld kingpins in America and is poised to conquer the new century. Then all the kingpins are shot by Scythe's elite team, the Zahlen Schwestern, as part of Reiji's plan to take over Inferno and manipulate the criminal underground for himself. He was able to do this because the Zahlen Schwestern were created based on Ein's data, and as he once tried to communicate with Ein, he managed to communicate with the Zahlen Schwestern and get them to trust in him. Reiji then shoots Scythe. If you also did the Cal route, then Lizzie reports that Cal managed to assassinate McGuire in Colombia. Reiji gives her the title of Phantom, as she became his best assassin in the 5 years since the hangar incident. If the player did not meet Cal, then she is simply not mentioned. In both variations, Lizzie is disgusted with what Reiji has become, leaving the organization for the country to start a bar. Reiji finally visits Claudia's grave at a small cemetery on top of a lonely hill, looking down at the city below. If the player is playing the DVD version, the player will get the first part of the ending password here. The ending password unlocks several extras such as the various production trailers, TV commercials, nearly all of the FMV sequences, and the sound track. However, the English translated DVD version has the \\"Gun Gallery\\" locked out for unknown reasons. The gun gallery is used to showcase all the guns that are in the game. The Woman in the High Castle: Unlike \\"From Atop the Hill\\", this ending has only one version regardless of whether the player met Cal or not. Reiji chooses to accept fate and allow Claudia to shoot him, and helps her by pretending to try and shoot her. Reiji ends up dying in Claudia's arms, telling her that she needs to live and get back all the things stolen from her, and to take revenge on Inferno. One year later, Claudia has hooked up with the new No.2 man of the Gambino family, and is slowly manipulating both him and the family for her own purposes. However, she still keeps the .38 special cartridge from the bullet that she shot Reiji with, and can't seem to get rid of it or forget what she did that morning in the Hangar. As she stands at a window looking down at the city below her, she vows to become stronger or she will lose to someone like her previous, merciless self. This ending will give the player the first part of the ending password as well.  Chapter 3  Road of the Cerulean Sky: This can be considered Ein's \\"True Ending\\". To obtain this ending, do not fully complete Mio's path in chapter 3, and at the final choice, choose to go after Elen. Reiji will find her in the church, and after a tearful reunion they get married right there and then. Reiji insists on fighting Cal, and manages to get Elen to promise him to leave and wait for him, and that he would definitely return to her. Cal arrives at the appointed time, and takes out the pocket watch that Reiji bought for her 2 years ago from a street vendor while the two of them were preparing for the counter snipe operation. Setting it on the altar, she opens it, starting the music, and sets the stage for the duel. When the music stops, both go for their guns, but Reiji is faster and Cal suffers a fatal wound. In the end, as she lies dying in Reiji's arms, Cal forgives Reiji for everything. Shortly after, the Godoh group sends 19 men to assault the church. Reiji nearly runs out of ammo, but is saved by the sudden appearance of Elen, and they manage to escape. Scythe arrives after the sun has set with the Zahlen Schwestern and manages to get Shiga to back off and let him handle the situation. In the ensuing battle, Elen shoots Scythe, and all the members of the Zahlen Schwestern are killed. When the semester starts, Mio, who was rescued from the ruins by Shiga (who of course insisted it was a kidnapping motivated by money), can't help but feel it was a dream. Regardless, she resolves to live her life and meet the challenges of tomorrow. Meanwhile, Elen and Reiji start a long and arduous investigation into Scythe and Elen's past, trying to discover her identity. They eventually trace her back to a Hong Kong brothel that handled young girls, and then to Ulan Bator, Mongolia, where the trail runs cold. Eventually a young translator gives them the advice to go to the grasslands and look at the sky to find Ein's homeland. With no other options, they do that, and Elen discovers that this place really is her homeland, and she ends the investigation, stating that she is satisfied just to be here with Reiji. This ending will give the player the second part of the ending password. Cherry Blossom Avenue: This is Mio's only ending. Elen and Cal meet at the church to duel. Cal puts her pocket watch on the altar and says that once the music stops, they shoot. Reiji appears at the last moment in order to stop the fight, but girls ignore him and fight like in the \\"Dusty Desert Trail\\" ending. When Elen throws a survival knife at Cal (which she one doesn't notice), Reiji shoots a bullet to make Cal move and not be killed and once again tries to sort out things with her, but to no avail as Cal has no intentions of making peace. Shiga and 20 of Godoh's men arrive at the church and start shooting the three assassins. Cal kills her way out and Reiji persuades Elen to leave through the back door while he stays behind. When Reiji runs out of ammunition, Mio runs into the church and persuades him to use her as a hostage so that he could get away from the church alive. Shiga orders the men to stop shooting and Reiji and Mio safely get out and run to the school. Shiga and his men follow them, but meet Scythe Master and the Zahlen Schwestern who also want to enter the school and kill Reiji. Shiga refuses to retreat and the groups start fighting each other. Meanwhile, Reiji and Mio talk in the school about various subjects. Shiga soon finds them and says that he is the only survivor. Reiji persuades him to take Mio away while he stays behind to deal with Zahlen Schwestern. Mio at first refuses to flee, but accepts Reiji's explanation when he promises her to return to her once the fight is over. While they are fleeing, Mio and Shiga are almost killed by one of the assassins, but Reiji kills her from the window and the two are able to run to the parking lot. Scythe notices them and orders the assassins to eliminate them. Shiga notices that the car is sabotaged and will explode if the ignition is turned on. Shiga removes the bomb from his car and orders Mio to hide behind a wall while he risks his life to check if the car is safe. At this point one of the assassins shoots Shiga and he is severely wounded, but manages to kill the assassin and drive Mio away. When they get far away enough to be safe, Shiga dies from his wounds, unable to tell Mio to not trust Reiji. Cal watches Shiga and Mio from a distance, satisfied because her help isn't needed. Then Elen appears and points a gun at Cal saying that she considers her to be the greatest threat around. Meanwhile, Reiji manages to kill the remaining assassins, but finds himself weaponless in front of Scythe's gun. Scythe compliments Reiji and calls him his best assassin, one who unfortunately wasn't obedient enough. During their conversation, Scythe calls Ein and Drei failed experiments. At this moment, Cal sneaks up behind Scythe and kills him for insulting her. She then tells Reiji that she will let him live for now as she owes Mio but promises him to kill him and Ein in future. Reiji then visits Mio later and they spend a night together, talking about various subjects and even sleep together. The next morning, Reiji leaves her because they are from a different world. Later on, Reiji meets with Mio's grandfather, the head of the Godoh group, and tells him to end his life of criminal activity for Mio's sake. The Godoh head refuses, so Reiji coldly threatens to kill everyone affiliated with the group before leaving the head in shock. Later, Reiji and Elen watch Mio visiting Shiga's grave from afar at the cemetery, with Elen asking Reiji if he's really sure about taking on the Godoh for the sake of one girl and Reiji answers that he will stay here a bit longer. The final scene shows cherry blossom petals fall all around Mio as she declares to look towards the future with optimism. Dusty Desert Trails: This can be considered Cal's \\"True Ending\\". As with \\"Road of the Cerulean Sky\\", do not fully complete Mio's path and at the last choice, choose to go after Drei. In this ending, Reiji rescues Mio, and they part with no explanations as Reiji is still trying to prevent her from getting mixed up in the mess. Cal returns and finds Mio gone, and calls Reiji. Taunting her over the phone, Reiji arranges a duel at the church in one hour, with the intent to deliberately lose. As the music box stops and Cal is about to fire, Elen appears and forces Cal to dodge and miss. The two girls then have a duel which Elen is about to win, but Reiji jumps in front of Cal, blocking the knife with his back and fainting. Cal is stunned that Reiji would do something like this for her, and Elen explains that this is what he wished for. Godoh's men attack the church, and Elen convinces Cal to take Reiji and escape from the back while she holds them off. After the sun has set, Scythe shows up at the church with the Zahlen Schwestern and marvels at the mound of corpses. Meanwhile, Cal has hidden in the school with Reiji, and Cal has reverted to her happy personality before she became Drei. She demands that Reiji have sex with her, but just as they are about to start, three members of the Zahlen Schwestern launch a surprise attack and are taken out by Cal almost instantly. Cal then goes to try and draw out the other three, but one of them sweeps the building looking for Reiji and falls into his trap. Just as Reiji is about to go help Cal, he is shot by Scythe. Cal blows up the last two Zahlen Schwestern using the chemistry lab, but is forced to drop her guns as Scythe uses Reiji as a hostage. Scythe is about to shoot Cal, but is shot by Elen who suffered fatal wounds from the battle with Godoh's men, and she dies in Cal's arms. An unspecified amount of time later, Reiji and Cal have become well known free lance assassins known as \\"Phantom\\" and hitched a ride on a truck heading to a desert town \\"Santa Madelia\\", presumably somewhere in Mexico (as one of the gangsters there use the term \\"gringo\\"), their target being the gang boss of the town with the whole town there to protect him. They make plans to go on a holiday after this job, and think about how they will be together, always. This ending will give the player the last part of the ending password. *There is also an additional \\"bad\\" ending exclusively for Phantom Integration that can be found in Chapter 3. In order to acquire this ending, the player must have completely fulfilled Cal's path back in chapter 2 (choose to make love to her) and then choose to search for Ein in chapter 3. This will follow the \\"Road of the Cerulean Sky\\" ending until it reaches the duel between Reiji and Cal. Here, Reiji is unable to keep his promise to Elen and hesitates in shooting Cal, allowing her to win the duel. Cal stands there and wonders why Reiji didn't shoot. A moment later, she is interrupted by Scythe arriving in the church with the Zahlen Schwestern in tow. Scythe is pleasantly surprised at the outcome of the match and compliments Cal. However, she seems dissatisfied and impulsively betrays Scythe, causing a shootout between her and the Zahlen Schwestern. Time passes until nightfall and Cal is lying down wounded on a beach, presumably winning the battle at the church. Ein arrives at the scene a moment later, seeking revenge against Cal for killing Reiji. However, Cal makes no motion to defend herself and simply lies there, appearing regretful for the events that transpired. Elen in turn loses her motivation to carry out her vengeance and looks up sorrowfully at the night sky. Nothing they do now will bring Reiji back, and so both of them can do nothing more but lament their loss.

Grid-friendly devices can include major appliances found in homes, commercial building systems such as HVAC, and many industrial systems.  Frequency Response  Most electric systems use alternating current with a nominal frequency of 50 or 60 Hz (hertz) to deliver energy produced by electrical generators to the electricity consumers. When the amount of electric power produced by the generators exceeds the power used by the customers, the frequency of the electricity rises. Conversely, when the amount of electric power produced is less than what is consumed, the frequency drops. Therefore frequency is an accurate indicator of the system-wide (called global) balance between supply and demand. Without grid-friendly frequency response, the rate at which the frequency changes is dependent principally on the system's total inertia (which is not very controllable) and the aggregate response of the generators' control systems (which can only be controlled relatively slowly). In contrast, grid-friendly devices can act very quickly.Ning Lu; Hammerstrom, D.J.; , \\"Design Considerations for Frequency Responsive Grid Friendly Appliances,\\" Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition, 2005/2006 IEEE PES , vol., no., pp.647-652, 21–24 May 2006 A grid-friendly device can respond to changes in frequency by reducing or interrupting the demand for electric power (called load) when the frequency drops below a certain threshold, and/or increasing load when the frequency rises. Although a single grid-friendly device may be a very small load, the fraction of the total load that can be controlled by frequency at any time is usually sufficient to provide under- frequency protection to the system before more drastic measures like black- outs are required.Ning Lu; Hammerstrom, D.J.; , \\"Design Considerations for Frequency Responsive Grid Friendly Appliances,\\" Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition, 2005/2006 IEEE PES , vol., no., pp.647-652, 21–24 May 2006 The advantage of grid-friendly frequency response is that frequency is ubiquitous on an electric system. When a generator shuts down in one part of the system, all the loads everywhere in the system can simultaneously detect the change and respond instantly and appropriately without the need for a control system to detect the problem, a control center to make a decision, or a telecommunications network to deliver commands to millions of devices. This type of behavior changes frequency from a simple electrodynamic and control systems input to an emergent property. While there is still some controversy on the subject, it is believed that complex systems utilizing self-regulation through emergence are generally more resilient and flexible than are simpler top-down command and control systems.  Voltage Response  In contrast to frequency, voltage varies widely throughout electric systems, because it is the voltage difference between two devices that largely determines the direction and magnitude of the current (hence the power) that flows between them. Therefore voltage is a more local phenomenon, and grid- friendly devices that respond to voltage will support more local aspects of the electric delivery system.Voltage Level as Information Carrier in Smart Distribution Networks However, load types such as thermally protected induction motors and power electronics can respond poorly to significant voltage changes.Chen, Heng. \\"Cascaded stalling of induction motors in fault- induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR).\\" Univ. Wisconsin-Madison, ECE Depart.(2011).Kundu, Soumya, and Ian A. Hiskens. \\"Overvoltages due to synchronous tripping of plug-in electric-vehicle chargers following voltage dips.\\" IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery 29.3 (2014): 1147-1156. When a sufficient fraction of the power demand in a region is composed of such loads, their collective response can lead to fault-induced delayed voltage recovery behavior, which may have adverse effects on transmission system reliability and may require mitigation to avoid initiating system outages.  Price Response  While frequency and voltage respond to physical phenomena on the electric system, grid-friendly price response is designed to address economic phenomena. With the increasing application of electricity markets to manage the efficient distribution of electric power, more consumers are exposed to electricity prices that change over time, rather than fixed for months or years. In general, higher prices occur at times when the electric system is running short of supply. The purpose of grid-friendly price response is to promote demand response among electricity consumers. Demand response is one means of reducing the market power of electricity suppliers when production runs short. Grid-friendly response to price also allows consumers to reduce their energy costs by using less electricity when prices are high, and more electricity when prices are low.D. Hammerstrom et al. (2007). Pacific Northwest GridWise Testbed Demonstration Projects Part I. Olympic Peninsula Project. PNNL no. 17167, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington Demonstrated Results A demonstration of grid-friendly technology was conducted for the United States Department of Energy in 2006 and 2007 in the Northwest region of the United States. Participants included local utilities, residential and commercial customers, industrial loads belonging to municipalities, and a number of vendors and researchers. The grid-friendly technology demonstration showed that common residential appliances did automatically detect grid problems expressed as frequency deviations and reduced energy consumption at critical moments. The Olympic Peninsula demonstration showed that residential, commercial, and industrial loads did adjust their consumption patterns based on price signals emanating from a distribution-level market operated as a double action. Both of these projects showed how grid-friendly technologies can and do reduce pressure on the electric grid during time of peak demand.D. Hammerstrom et al. (2007).

Historically, when the Philippines was still a United States territory, the University of Santo Tomas (established in 1611) was considered the oldest university under the American flag. Presently in the United States, there is no official definition of what entitles an institution to be considered a university versus a college, and the common understanding of university has evolved over time. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica tells the story of the gradual emergence of U.S. \\"universities\\" thus: The issue is further confused by the fact that at time of founding of many of the institutions in question, the United States didn't exist as a sovereign nation. Moreover, questions of institutional continuity sometimes make it difficult to determine the true \\"age\\" of any institution. Furthermore, contesting of the status of first university should not be confused with the contesting of the status of oldest public university in the United States, which is a title claimed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (first operating), University of Georgia (first chartered), and the College of William & Mary (initially private).  Claimants and potential claimants  Several universities claim to be the first university in the United States: *Harvard University, founded in 1636, claims to be \\"the oldest institution of higher education in the United States\\". The claim of being \\"the first university\\" has been made on its behalf by others.For example, . An early official mention of Harvard as \\"the University\\" is found in the Massachusetts Constitution, first submitted on October 28, 1779, by James Bowdoin, Samuel Adams, and John Adams. *The University of Pennsylvania, established in 1740,The university officially uses 1740 as its founding date and has since 1899. The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin, (1705/1706–1790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition . Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd notes: \\"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\\" Princeton's library presents another, diplomatically phrased view. considers itself to be America's first university, a title it claims on its website and in other published materials. The university has published a book about being the first university in America, () and its website contains numerous instances of the phrase \\"America's First University\\".http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q;=site:www.upenn.edu+%22america's+first+university%22&ie;=UTF-8&oe;=UTF-8 *The College of William and Mary's website states, \\"The College of William and Mary was the first college to become a university (1779).\\"The Pennsylvania university closely followed in 1781 The College of William and Mary * Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876 and claims to be \\"America's first research university\\" (emphasis added).  Claims of being \\"the first university in the United States\\" = Institutional age  University of Pennsylvania does not claim to be the first college, but it does claim to be the first university in America. \\"In the Anglo-American model, a college, by definition, is a faculty whose subject specialization is in a single academic field. This is usually arts and sciences (often referred to as \\"liberal arts\\"), but may also be one of the professions: law, medicine, theology, etc. A university, by contrast, is the co-existence, under a single institutional umbrella, of more than one faculty. With the founding of the first medical school in America (in 1765; Columbia was second), Penn became America's first university. No other American institution of higher learning was named \\"University\\" before Penn.\\" Harvard University calls itself \\"the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States\\" and this claim is rarely challenged. It is possible to disagree what year should be taken as Harvard's \\"real\\" founding date (Harvard uses the earliest possible one, 1636, when the institution was chartered by the Massachusetts Bay Colony). However, Harvard has operated since 1650 under the same corporation, the \\"President and Fellows of Harvard College\\"; it thus has an unbroken institutional history dating back to the mid seventeenth century. William & Mary calls itself \\"America's second-oldest college\\", acknowledging Harvard's claim but adding that William & Mary itself is the nation's oldest college in its \\"antecedents,\\" the College of Henricopolis or University of Henrico established by the Virginia Company near Richmond, Virginia. This institution received a royal charter in 1618 and operated a school for several years before being destroyed with the town during the Indian Massacre of 1622, but it never offered college-level instruction. The following year, King James I dissolved the Virginia Company, converting the Colony of Virginia to a crown colony. William and Mary was founded under a new charter in 1693.  Official designation as a \\"university\\"  University of Pennsylvania = The founding date of the University of Pennsylvania is associated with more subjectivity and institutional debate than the more straightforward dates used by the eight other colonial era colleges. Harvard University uses as its founding date 1636, the year in which the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony formally voted to budget funds for the creation of a college in Newtowne, later called Cambridge. The seven remaining colonial era colleges consider their founding dates to be the year in which they were first granted charters and thus became legal corporations. Penn's claim as the first university in the United States is three-fold: the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America made Penn the first institution to offer both \\"undergraduate\\" and professional education; the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of \\"University\\"; and existing colleges were established as seminaries (although, as detailed in its own article, Penn adopted a traditional seminary curriculum as well). Harvard and Yale were officially affiliated with the Congregational Church. Although officially nonsectarian, Princeton was founded by Presbyterians. Similarly, though Penn was officially nonsectarian, it was established by a board composed of Church of England and Methodist members, with a curriculum consistent with those religions. The first charter for an institution of higher learning in Philadelphia was granted in 1755 to the College of Philadelphia, a new undertaking of the Academy of Philadelphia, which had previously taught only secondary students. In 1779, a charter was granted to a separate institution called the \\"University of the State of Pennsylvania\\" which in 1791 was merged with the College of Philadelphia and issued a new charter as the \\"University of Pennsylvania\\". Despite the three charter dates of 1755, 1779 and 1791, the university used for more than a century the founding date of 1749, the year in which founder Benjamin Franklin first convened a board of trustees to organize the new institution. In 1899, the university's board of trustees voted to change the founding date by nine years to 1740, the year in which a group of Philadelphia citizens established a trust for a charity school requested by traveling evangelist George Whitefield. A frame of a building was erected, but the citizens discovered that they lacked the funds to furnish the interior chapel or open the charity school. The unfinished edifice lay vacant for roughly a decade until Franklin's nascent Academy of Philadelphia was looking for space to begin operations and purchased the still unused building in 1750. The Academy of Philadelphia operated a charity school for a few years and this brief period was the basis for the trustees' claims of institutional continuity to the earlier date, as the Academy had assumed the trust of the charity school for local orphans planned but not begun by the original fundraisers of the building. Parenthetically, the University of Pennsylvania calls itself the fourth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, comparing the legal charter dates of Princeton University (1746) and Columbia University (1754) with the 1740 date in which the trust had been established and fundraising had begun for the building it would ultimately purchase in 1750. Perhaps not surprisingly, Princeton University and Columbia University do not follow the same train of thought in their own institutional histories. Princeton and Columbia consider themselves the fourth and fifth oldest institutions of higher learning in the country, respectively, comparing the three collegiate charter dates of 1746, 1754 and 1755. This seemingly minor difference of opinion assumes greater importance in the world of academia. Formal academic processions such as those at graduation ceremonies place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates, explaining why universities have sometimes used strained rationales to claim and defend dates as early as possible. The University of Pennsylvania changed its founding date in 1899, four years after elite universities in the United States agreed that academic processions would follow this age-based hierarchy. The revision in founding date was the result of a three-year campaign initiated by the university's \\"Alumni Register\\" magazine to make it older than Princeton for these processions. The argument used is that it is the common legal practice to date the founding of an institution from the date of founding for the oldest trust it administers. In this case, the oldest trust that the University of Pennsylvania administers was established in 1740. Historian Edward Potts Cheyney states that, \\"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers.\\" (The university still administers this trust in the funding of the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.) He also points out that Harvard's founding date is merely the year in which the Massachusetts General Court resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a \\"School or College\\". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746—the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known copy is extant. Though it is a common practice to use the dates of charter as the official date, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.Edward Potts Cheyney, \\"History of the University of Pennsylvania: 1740-1940\\", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1940. 45-52 In brief, in 1779 the College of Philadelphia was directed by provost William Smith.

Woonton's announcement on 15 November 2004 that he was forming a coalition with the rival Cook Islands Party with himself as Prime Minister.

Woonton responded by launching his own party, the Demo Tumu Party, on 1 December 2004. Initially the party consisted of 4 MPs: Woonton, Pare, then- education minister Jim Marurai and Democratic backbenchers Teenui Mapumai and Poko Simpson. The party maintained its coalition agreement with the Cook Islands Party and the support of independent MP Piho Rua, and Woonton remained Prime Minister. Woonton subsequently resigned his seat in order to fight a by- election, causing his government to be dissolved.

The tradition has been far rarer historically than primogeniture (sole inheritance by the first-born) or partible inheritance (division of the estate among the children). Advantages and disadvantages Ultimogeniture might be considered appropriate in circumstances where the youngest child had been assigned the role of \\"keeping the hearth\\", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children had had time and opportunity to succeed in the world and provide for themselves. In a variation on the system, elder children might have received a share of land and moveable property at a younger age, for example when marrying and founding their own family. Ultimogeniture might also be considered appropriate for the estates of elderly rulers and property-owners, whose children were likely to be mature adults. There are several disadvantages for realms and families that adopt ultimogeniture. One such drawback is the fact that elder siblings, especially the first born of the relevant gender, will be heavily incentivized to sidestep the tradition, even more so if primogeniture inheritance is a familiar concept. And since the elder siblings likely have more time and opportunities to gain power, wealth, experience, and influence prior to the inheritance—simply because they were born earlier—ultimogeniture traditions are more likely to be disregarded or even discarded. Coercion, assassination, fratricide, or even patricide can be committed, backed by all the advantage an elder sibling would have, such that ultimogeniture is sidestepped. To clarify, those who stand to gain by ignoring the stipulation under ultimogeniture are more likely to have the facility to do so, when compared to other succession laws. For example, under primogeniture tradition, the younger siblings will stand to gain if they can bypass said tradition, but the elder siblings still have the aforementioned advantages, so primogeniture traditions tend to persist. Usage examples * Many folkloric traditions around the world include important figures who were youngest siblings, although they are subject to various interpretations. Several important Biblical characters—including Isaac, Jacob, and David—are described as youngest sons or daughters, leading some scholars to propose a prehistoric practice of ultimogeniture among the Hebrews, although this form of inheritance is not espoused by the preserved text.. A footnote in Frazer says: \\"Compare Hesiod, Theog. 132 sqq. who agrees in describing Cronus as the youngest of the brood. As Zeus, who succeeded his father Cronus on the heavenly throne, was likewise the youngest of his family (Hesiod, Theog. 453 sqq.), we may conjecture that among the ancient Greeks or their ancestors inheritance was at one time regulated by the custom of ultimogeniture or the succession of the younger...\\" . In some early Greek myths, kingship was conferred by marriage to a tribal nymph, who was selected by ultimogeniture or success in a race. * In England, patrilineal ultimogeniture (i.e., inheritance by the youngest surviving male child) is known as \\"Borough English\\", after its former practice in various ancient English boroughs. It was only enforced against those who died intestate and frequently—though not universally—also included the principle of inheritance by the deceased's youngest brother when there was no son. Less often, the practice was extended to the youngest daughter, sister, aunt, etc. Its origin is much disputed, although the Normans—who generally practiced primogeniture—considered it to be a Saxon legacy. A 1327 court case found it to be the practice of the English burgh at Nottingham, although not of that town's \\"French\\" district.Yearbook of 22 Edward IV. fol. 32b. The tradition was also found across many rural areas of England where lands were held in tenure by socage. It also occurred in copyhold manors in Hampshire, Surrey, Middlesex, Suffolk, and Sussex, where manorial custom dictated the form of inheritance to be ultimogeniture. * In the German Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, land-holdings traditionally passed to the youngest son, who might then employ his older brothers as farm workers. * In India, matrilineal ultimogeniture is practiced by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, wherein inheritance is traditionally passed down to the youngest daughter. Although portions of the property are divided among siblings, the bulk of the share, including the \\"ancestral hearth\\", is bestowed on the youngest daughter (), who is also expected to take care of the aging parents, as well as any unmarried siblings. As a consequence, marriage to the youngest daughter is uxorilocal, as opposed to marriage to the other siblings, which is neolocal. * Among the Malabar Syrian Christian community of Kerala in southern India, a variant of ultimogeniture is practised, where the youngest son gets the ancestral house (tharavad) and adjoining property and is expected to take care of his elderly parents, while his elder brothers also get a share of the property though they live separately; the daughters are granted a bounteous dowry but traditionally do not receive inheritance of property. Only if there are no sons, the husband of the youngest daughter is formally embraced into the family as adopted son (dathu puthran) to fulfill the role of the youngest son. * In some southwestern areas of Japan, property was traditionally apportioned by a modified version of ultimogeniture known as masshi souzoku (). An estate was distributed equally among all sons or children, except that the youngest received a double share as a reward for caring for the elderly parents in their last years. Official surveys conducted during the early years of the Meiji era demonstrated that the most common family form throughout the country during the Edo period was characterized by stem structure, patrilineal descent, patrivirilocal residence and patrilineal primogeniture, but in some southwestern areas this combination of partible inheritance and ultimogeniture was sometimes employed. * Among Mongols, each son received part of the family herd as he married, with the elder sons receiving more than the younger ones, but the ancestral seat was inherited by the youngest along with his share of the herd. Likewise, each son inherited part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder sons receiving more than the younger ones, but further afield from the family tent. (Family units would often remain near enough for close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations.) Similarly, Genghis Khan's empire was divided among all four of his sons, but the Mongolian homeland was passed to his youngest, Tolui. * The Kachin of northern Burma and southern China traditionally instruct elder sons to move away upon maturity, leaving the youngest son to inherit the family property. *The Dai people of southern China pass their bamboo houses down to the youngest son of the family, requiring older children to move away and live independently from their parents. * The island of Bornholm explicitly recognized ultimogeniture in a statute dated to 1773.

Biography José Basílio da Gama was born in 1740, in the city of São José do Rio das Mortes (whose name was later changed to Tiradentes), in Minas Gerais, to Manuel da Costa Villas-Boas and Quitéria Inácia da Gama. The death of his father, when he was a young child, caused a hard situation in his life. During this period, a brigadier named Alpoim who served as his protector sent him to Rio de Janeiro, where he studied at Jesuit College, starting his novitiate for the Society of Jesus. With the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1759, Basílio went to Europe, where he travelled through many countries, such as Italy and Portugal, between 1760 and 1767. In Italy, he ingressed at the Roman Arcadia, where he adopted the pen name Termindo Sipílio. During the first months of 1767, he went to Rio de Janeiro, to the inauguration of the ship \\"Serpente\\" (mentioned in the third canto of his epic poem O Uraguai). In 1768, he returned to Portugal, in hopes of entering at the University of Coimbra, but was arrested and exiled in Portuguese Angola, due to suspicion of being a Jesuit sympathizer.

It is the oldest structure in the Tampa Bay area still used for its original purpose. The lighthouse Egmont Key Lighthouse at Egmont Key State Park When the first Egmont Key Light was built in 1848, it was the only lighthouse on the Gulf coast of Florida between Key West and St. Marks. In September 1848 a hurricane covered the island with six feet of water and damaged the new lighthouse. The keeper and his family rode out the storm in a small boat tied to a tree. When the keeper saw the damage to the lighthouse, he rowed off to Tampa and never returned. Another hurricane a few weeks later caused more damage, and beach erosion threatened to topple the tower. A hurricane in 1852 again threatened to topple the tower by undermining it. In 1857 work was begun rebuilding the tower. It apparently was moved inland at that time. The reconstruction was completed in 1858, and the lighthouse was placed back in service with a new third order Fresnel lens. The lens was removed by Confederates during the Civil War to frustrate the Union Navy efforts to blockade Tampa Bay but was restored after the war. In 1944 the lantern was removed from the lighthouse tower and replaced with an aerobeacon. The Coast Guard continued to man the lighthouse until 1990, when it became one of the last lighthouses in the United States to be automated. Beach erosion has again threatened the lighthouse, and sand was pumped into the beach in front of the tower in 2000. In 2001 the Coast Guard announced plans to deactivate the light, but as of July, 2016 has not done so. The Coast Guard has declared the lighthouse surplus property, and turned it over to the General Services Administration to be sold. The key Egmont Key as a whole has a rich history. The entire island is on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a National Wildlife Refuge and a state park. At the time the first lighthouse was being built in 1848, Colonel Robert E. Lee was making a survey of the southern coast, and recommended that defensive works be built on Egmont Key because of its strategic location. In the 1850s Egmont Key was used as a temporary holding area for Seminoles before they were shipped to the Indian Territory. Many of them perished while being held captive and are buried at the location. Early in the Civil War, Confederate blockade-runners used the island as a base. Union forces captured the island in July 1861 and used it as a base for attacks on Confederate ships and positions in the Tampa area. The Union also used the island as a military prison and a refuge for southern pro-Union sympathizers. A cemetery for Union and Confederate dead was opened on the island in 1864. The cemetery was closed in 1909 and the bodies were moved to military cemeteries at other locations. Fort Dade Egmont Key Lighthouse without lantern, U.S. Coast Guard Archive At the start of the Spanish–American War, Fort Dade (named for Major Francis L. Dade, who was killed in a battle in the Second Seminole War) was established on Egmont Key to protect Tampa Bay from a Spanish attack. It consisted of several coastal artillery batteries protecting the main ship channel into Tampa Bay, as well as a secondary channel to the south of the island. A hospital at Fort Dade was used to quarantine all American soldiers returning from Cuba for ten days. During World War I Fort Dade was used as a training center for National Guard Coast Artillery Units. The fort was deactivated in 1921. Egmont Key was put to military use again during World War II, as a harbor patrol station and an ammunition storage facility. Head keepers * Sherrod Edwards (1847–1850) * N.

The American children's television series has a long history in Japan, airing for three decades as a dubbed program, and recently restarting as a local co-production. Sesame Street's dubbed original (1971-2004, 2020-onwards) Sesame Street has been one of NHK's most successful children's programs and one of the first to be imported from overseas. Sesame Street first aired on November 8, 1971, but was taken off the network in the early 1980s. It resumed from 1988 until the end of March 2004, when production on a local adaptation was announced, which NHK refused to be involved in. While Sesame Street is primarily designed for preschool children, teenagers and adults watched the program as a guide to learning English (though much later on, a dubbed version was available). NHK also co-produced the 1988 PBS special, Big Bird in Japan. The original show aired on NHK until April 2004. After 16 years, \\"Elmo's Playdate\\" was aired on May 16, 2020. Sesame Street's Japanese co-production In November 2003, the brand's master license was acquired by Asatsu-DK Co., Ltd. and WE'VE Co., Ltd. Sesame Street Partners Japan was founded the following year. Along with the original partners, Japan Keizai Company, TV Tokyo Broadband, and Odyssey Communications were added to the \\"consortium.\\" The partnership initiated development of a new series, to focus on literacy and Japanese culture, with a curriculum developed by local educators. TV Tokyo commissioned a local co-production, that began airing weekly in October 2004. Besides basic literacy skills, this version of Sesame Street focuses on ethics, interacting with friends, and environmental issues. The series is in Japanese, except for regularly included English lesson segments. At the start of the show, four new Muppet characters were introduced: Teena, a kindful pinkish-purple monster who likes to sing and dance; Mojabo, a happy go lucky green and purple monster who likes to exercise; Pierre, a blue-and-yellow frog; and Arthur, a little yellow bird. In 2006, two new Muppets were added to the series—Grorie, a female orange Grover- like monster, and Meg, a Japanese girl. A few established Sesame Street characters appear in new segments, most notably Elmo, Big Bird, and Cookie Monster, who in the Japanese series has a propensity to laugh out loud and is used heavily to deal with emotional issues. While Sesame Workshop is generally on the forefront of cultural understanding when creating the co-productions, this is apparently not the case with the Japanese version. One script included a plot line where a child trips during a race at a school sports festival. Sesame Workshop insisted the other characters must help him up, something the local producers insisted was unrealistic in modern Japanese culture. An article in The Japan Times reported that the show was suffering from low ratings in its early months: \\"Viewers are complaining about the differences in the characters' voices compared with the NHK-aired version and about the exclusive use of Japanese.\\" Another scathing article, published in November 2004 in the Yomiuri Shinbun, was titled \\"A wrong turn on new Sesame Street\\": > \\"[The] new and not improved version of Sesame Street...opens with the cast > shouting: 'English, Everybody. It's Sesame Street,' but it was 20 minutes > later before we heard another English phrase.

Ke'lets is the Chukchi demon of death. Myth has it that he hunts men while accompanied by his dogs. Corrected Description: ' Ke'let refers to ogres or evil spirits who hunt men in Chukchi mythology. Some possess dogs as large as reindeer and others own fire-breathing reindeer. The Chukchi use the word Ke'le or Ke'let interchangeably when describing these monsters, but usually Ke'let seems to be plural and Ke'le is singular. Ke'lets does not seem to be a proper term for them but is an Anglicized version of Ke'let. There are both male and female Ke'let, all of whom enjoy eating human beings. Like ogres in other cultures, they are often outwitted by fast-thinking humans. Ke'let are sometimes referred to as Re'kkenit (singular form is Re'kken), a Chukchi word for evil spirits. In 1996 Carol Rose published SPIRITS, FAIRIES, LEPRECHAUNS, AND GOBLIINS-AN ENCYCLOPEDIA, which included an entry for Ke'lets. This work, while marvelous in its scope, is full of erroneous and poorly researched material, as is her subsequent volume, GIANTS, MONSTERS, AND DRAGONS. Too many people using the internet reference these works and thus the only entry for some creatures from folklore to be found on the web, such as Ke'lets, is the one Ms. Rose wrote down in her books. This is unfortunate as it causes the spread of misinformation. Ms. Rose made the mistake of identifying Ke'lets (incorrect grammar) as follows \\"A fearsome demon in the folk beliefs of the Chukchi people of Siberia. With his dogs he tracks down human hunters and travelers to kill them in the wilderness\\". As one can see, she has incorrectly labeled Ke'lets, an Anglicized version of Ke'let, as a unique creature and a male. Ke'let are neither unique (there are many of them) nor always male (females are as common as males). Incidentally, Carol Rose took the description for these creatures from an earlier work; GODS AND GODDESSES, DEVILS AND DEMONS BY MANFRED LURKER (1988); a book which also got the description wrong.

For 24 years (1991-2015) he was an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the Hubble Space Telescope. He has published more than 400 scientific articles on topics including cosmology, supernova explosions, black holes, extrasolar planets, and the emergence of life in the universe. His book on the irrational number phi, The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number (2002), won the Peano Prize and the International Pythagoras Prize for popular books on mathematics. Life and scientific career Livio was born in Bucharest in Romania, and lived with his grandparents when his mother and father were forced to flee the country for political reasons. He left Romania at age five with his grandparents, and the family settled in Israel. He served as a paramedic with the Israeli Defense Forces in the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the 1982 Lebanon War. Livio earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a Master of Science degree in theoretical particle physics at the Weizmann Institute, and a Ph.D. in theoretical astrophysics at Tel Aviv University. He was a professor of physics at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology from 1981 to 1991, before moving to the Space Telescope Science Institute. From 2000, Livio focused his research on supernova explosions and their use in determining the rate of expansion of the universe. He has also studied so-called dark energy, black holes, and the formation of planetary systems around young stars. He has contributed to hundreds of papers in peer- reviewed journals on astrophysics. In 2009, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Council elected him as a Fellow of the AAAS. Livio was cited for his \\"distinguished contributions to astrophysics through research on stars and galaxies and through communicating and interpreting science and mathematics to the public.\\" He is also cited in the American Men and Women of Science. Livio has been nominated three times by the USA Science and Engineering Festival as one of the \\"Nifty Fifty Speakers\\" to talk about his work and career to middle and high school students in 2010, 2011, and 2013. Other honors include: Carnegie Centenary Professor in 2003, Danz Distinguished Lecturer in 2006, Resnick Distinguished Lecturer in 2006, Iben Distinguished Lecturer in 2008, and Terzian Distinguished Lecturer in 2011. Livio and his wife Sofie, a microbiologist, have three children. Popular works Livio has popularized astronomy and mathematics through books, lectures, magazine articles, and radio and television appearances. He has appeared on TV and radio outlets including PBS, NPR, and CBS to discuss scientific and mathematical subjects. Livio's first book of popular science was The Accelerating Universe (2000), which described the theory that the universe was expanding at a faster and faster rate. He explored the possible causes and the theoretical implications of continuing expansion, especially its implications for beliefs about the \\"beauty\\" of the scientific laws that govern the cosmos. Livio's next book, The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi (2002), concerned patterns in nature and art. He traced the influence of the golden ratio through many centuries of art, architecture, music, and even stock market theories. The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved (2005) described how efforts to solve the quintic equation led to group theory and to the mathematics of symmetry. He emphasizes the crucial roles of Évariste Galois and Niels Henrik Abel in developing this branch of mathematics. The book contains biographical sketches of Galois, Abel, and several other mathematicians. Is God A Mathematician? (2009) discusses the ability of mathematics to describe and predict accurately the physical world. Livio also attempts to answer a question with which mathematicians and philosophers have struggled for centuries: Is mathematics ultimately invented or discovered? The book was selected by the Washington Post as one of the best books of 2009. Brilliant Blunders (2013) investigates serious mistakes by five notable figures in science: Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Linus Pauling, Fred Hoyle, and Albert Einstein. Why? What Makes Us Curious (2017) explores the nature of human curiosity, focusing on Leonardo da Vinci and Richard Feynman. Galileo and the Science Deniers (2020) takes a new look at the life and scientific achievements of Galileo Galilei, and places the quest for scientific truths in the context of science denial today.

Early life and career Born to a prominent military family in Hampton, Virginia, Barron was entered into the US Navy at age two on January 1, 1812 (presumably because his father, Commodore Samuel Barron (1765-1810), had commanded the nearby naval base). In 1820, Barron began serving as a midshipman. He rose through the ranks and was commissioned a lieutenant on March 3, 1827. He was promoted to commander on July 15, 1847 during the Mexican–American War. Commanding the from 1849 to 1853, Barron was made a captain in September 1855. He then was captain of the steam frigate , whose crew included George Dewey, from 1858 until 1859. He was appointed chief of the Bureau of Detail in 1860, and thus held considerable influence within the US Navy. Following Lincoln's inauguration the following year, he was suspected of attempting to gain control over the Department of the Navy. Civil War In April 1861, after Virginia announced its secession from the Union, Barron resigned from the U.S. Navy and, although his resignation was denied by the United States (later being listed by Navy Secretary Gideon Welles on April 22 as dismissed), he accepted a commission as Captain in the Virginia Navy and, as chief of the Office of Naval Detail and Equipment, later assisting in organizing a coastal defense of the Virginia and North Carolina coastlines. After Virginia's fleet was integrated with the Confederate Navy, Barron was issued a commission as commander and appointed chief of the Office of Orders and Details on June 10. Barron would remain in that post until July 20, when Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory agreed to Barron's request to be assigned as commander of coastal defences of Virginia and North Carolina, an important port for Pamlico Sound- based Confederate privateers. Arriving at his headquarters on Fort Hatteras on August 28, Barron commanded the defense of both the forts Hatteras and Clark against Union Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham during the Battle of Hatteras Inlet on August 28–29. Barron was captured following the surrender of the two fortresses. Held at Fort Columbus on Governors Island in New York harbor, then at Ft. Warren, Boston harbor, Barron was eventually released in a prisoner exchange the next year. In 1862 while imprisoned at Ft. Warren, Boston, Lt. William T. Glassell stated: \\"Generals Buckner and Tilghman were then rooming with me, and together with Commodore Barron...\\" In November 1862, Barron was briefly reassigned command of naval forces in Virginia before he was sent to Great Britain to take command of the two ironclad rams, CSS North Carolina and CSS Mississippi (also known as the 'Laird Rams'), that were being built under the direction of Commander James D. Bulloch for the Confederacy. After the ships were seized by British authorities the following year, Barron traveled to France, remaining in Paris as \\"Flag Officer\\" commanding Confederate States Naval Forces in Europe acting as a contact for Confederate naval officers as well as blockade runners and privateers until February 25, 1865 when he resigned his commission, returning to the United States shortly before the Confederacy's surrender a month later. Retiring to his home in Essex County, Virginia, Barron took up farm life until his death on February 26, 1888. References * McHenry, Robert. Webster's American Military Biographies.

Notable dishes include gazpacho, fried fish (often called pescaíto frito in the local vernacular), the jamones of Jabugo, Valle de los Pedroches and Trevélez, and the wines of Jerez, particularly sherry. Fried foods Puntillitas, battered and fried baby squid Frying in Andalucian cuisine is dominated by the use of olive oil that is produced in the provinces of Jaén, Córdoba, Seville, and Granada. Málaga, Almería, Cádiz and Huelva produce olive oil too, but in smaller amounts. The foods are dredged in flour a la Andaluza (meaning only flour, without egg or other ingredients, but may include flour from the chickpea especially for use in batters). They are then fried in a large quantity of hot olive oil. Fish and shellfish With five coastal provinces, the consumption of fish and shellfish is rather high: white shrimp from the Bay of Cádiz; prawns; murex; anchovies; baby squid; cuttlefish; \\"bocas de la Isla\\", a dish found in San Fernando that uses a local crab that can regenerate its claw; flounder; etc. Andalucian cuisine includes also some unusual seafood, like ortiguillas, sea anemones in batter. Desserts Pestiños de miel, a honey- coated sweet fritter Sugar was first introduced to Andalusia by the Moors around the 10th-century and cultivated in Granada. Andalucian desserts are heavily influenced by Arabic medieval Andalucian cuisine. Notable dishes include pestiños (a deep-fried pastry bathed in honey), alfajores, amarguillos (a form of almond macaroons) from Medina Sidonia, the polvorones (almond cookies of Estepa), lard bread, wine doughnuts, torrijas and calentitos. Wines and liquors The wines of Jerez (also known as sherry) are famous the world over, praised even by William Shakespeare. Other standouts are the manzanilla of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, the white wines of Cádiz, paxarete (a sherry derivative), wines of Condado in Huelva, wines of Montilla-Moriles in Córdoba, wines of Málaga, and la tintilla of Rota. The liquors of the region are also popular, included the anís made in Rute, and in Cazalla de la Sierra, and the rums from the Tropical Coast of Granada (Motril). Typical dishes Jamón, dry-cured pork ham Typical Andalucian dishes include pescaito frito (fried fish), gazpacho, Cordoban salmorejo, pringá, oxtail, jamón ibérico (Iberian ham), prepared olives, alboronía, poleá, anise, and various kinds of wine, including sherries (fino, manzanilla, oloroso, Pedro Ximénez, amontillado) which are undoubtedly the most exported and most widely available of all Spanish wines, as well as Málaga wine.

Philosopher, their second LP, was recorded and mixed between May and June 2004 at Big Blue Meenie Studios in Jersey City by Joe Pedulla and Arun Venkatesh (Overkill, All Out War) and mastered in July in New York City by Tom Hutten (Iggy Pop, Foo Fighters). This record was released in December 2004 by Trinity Records Hong Kong in Asia, Europe and North America; in March 2005 by Rawforce Records in South America except Argentina; by Furias / Orion Music in Argentina; and distributed by The Art Records in Mexico and Central America. Philosopher’s lyrics are based on part of the bibliographies of Gautama, Seneca, Rousseau, Heraclitus, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Lao Tzu. Musically, Requiem Aeternam’s style can be defined as 'Philosophic Metal', since it combines different philosophic ideologies with diverse music approaches. Later history During 2005, Requiem Aeternam was enlisted in the main metal festivals throughout the USA, including Milwaukee and Norwest Death Metal Fest among others, and participated in numerous metal compilations in Europe and North America. The release party for Philosopher occurred at CBGB's, in New York City, days before this legendary venue was shut down. In addition, the video clip of \\"Wisdom\\" was broadcast by various channels in North and Latin America. In February 2009, with the return of drummer Fabián Redondo, the band registered its third and most ambitious album to date Destiny-Man, recorded at Big 3 Records in St. Petersburg, Florida by Jim Beeman (Cheap Trick, Jefferson Airplane) and mixed at Morrisound Studios in Tampa, Florida by Tom Morris (Sepultura, Obituary). The compositions were inspired by 10 classical composers: Takemitsu, Beethoven, Mozart, Piazzolla, Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Gershwin, Chopin, Paganini and Villa-Lobos.

These routes connect a central or commercial district of a city or town with an Interstate bypass, and are signed with green shields resembling the Interstate Highway shield. The word BUSINESS is used instead of INTERSTATE, and, above the number, where the state name is sometimes included, the word LOOP or SPUR appears. A business loop has both ends as its \\"parent\\", while a business spur has a \\"dangling end\\", sometimes running from the end of the Interstate to the downtown area. As the main purpose of a Business Interstate is to serve a downtown area, it is typically routed on surface roads. Thus Business Interstates don’t have to meet Interstate Highway standards. AASHTO does, however, apply similar standards as to new U.S. Routes, requiring a new Business Interstate to meet certain design standards. Business Interstates are also sometimes routed onto freeways that were once designated as mainline Interstates themselves (such as the now-decommissioned Interstate 40 Business in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and the existing Interstate 80 Business in Sacramento, California). Business Interstates are most often posted in the western states, across the Great Plains and in Michigan. Eastern states generally did not designate business routes, as most of the Interstates paralleled the original U.S. routes instead of directly replacing them. With the exception of mountainous areas, this left most of the U.S. highways in place, or as co-signed routes with the parent Interstate, while the former routes were redesignated as local or frontage roads. In contrast, construction of the Interstate system in the western states often directly overlaid the old U.S. highway, leaving the former road impassable or as a disconnected route. Exceptions were at cities and towns, where the freeway would shift onto a bypass around them. This often left extant segments of old U.S. Highways in place, with a business route designation applied to them as a motorist aid to and from a business district of collection of motorists services. Like auxiliary Interstate Highways, business Interstates can be repeated from state to state along their route. However, unlike auxiliary Interstate Highways, business Interstates can also be repeated in several locations within the same state. { border=\\"0\\" class=\\"toccolours\\" ! :  I-5 I-205 I-8 I-10 I-15 I-16 I-20 I-24 I-25 I-26 I-27 I-29 I-229 I-30 I-35 I-40 I-44 I-45 I-55 I-59 I-64 I-65 I-66 I-69 I-70 I-71 I-72 I-74 I-75 I-375 I-76(W) I-376 I-77 I-78 I-79 I-80 I-81 I-82 I-83 I-84(E) I-84(W) I-85 I-385 I-585 I-86 I-87 I-89 I-90 I-94 I-95 I-495 I-96 I-196 I-496 I-696 } List Defunct routes are listed in italics.

It was designed to complement the Javelin anti-tank missile. The Predator had a longer range and was more powerful than the AT4 that it was designed to replace, but had a shorter range than the Javelin. The missile system received the FGM-172 designation from the Department of Defense in 2006. Prior to that it was known as the SRAW MK 40 MOD 0. Features The Predator was a fire- and-forget weapon utilizing a system called predicted line of sight (PLOS). In this system the operator tracks the target for a short time (at least 2 seconds and no more than 12) prior to launch. This data is then combined with known missile flight performance to predict a flightpath that will intercept the target's course, and program the missile's autopilot system. An inertial guidance unit was incorporated into the autopilot to compensate for crosswind and other factors encountered in flight. The original FGM-172A was an overfly top attack (OTA) type and used a downward-facing dual laser and magnetic sensor to detect the target and trigger the detonation of the warhead. The laser sensor would locate the positions of the leading and trailing edges of the tank, and the magnetic sensor would provide confirmation of the position of the tank. Once a target was detected, the FGM-172A would fire an explosively formed penetrator downwards into the weak armor of the turret roof. The missile does not \\"lock on\\" to a specific target, rather, the FGM-172A would attack the first potential target it encountered during its flight. TM 10687A OR/C notes that operators must avoid firing the weapon over destroyed vehicles for this reason. The FGM-172B altered the flight control systems for a direct interception rather than an overfly course, and featured a dual-mode impact fuze with an automatic time delay if the missile struck a soft target. The Kestrel variant featured an additional unguided direct-fire mode. Variants The missile was produced in two variants, each with a separate weapons payload. The FGM-172A featured a downward-firing top attack warhead activated by a dual sensor fuse, intended for use as an anti-armor weapon. The FGM-172B featured a multi-purpose blast-fragmentation warhead, intended for use as an assault weapon. Also known as the FGM-172B SRAW-MPV. History The SRAW (Short-Range Assault Weapon) program was begun by the U.S. Marine Corps in 1987 as a replacement for existing unguided M72 LAW and AT4 anti-armor rockets. A demonstration/validation phase was conducted by several companies between February 1990 and mid-1993, with the first test firings occurring in 1991. In July 1994, the Predator design of Loral (now Lockheed Martin) was selected for the EMD (Engineering and Manufacturing Development) phase. EMD Phase I was completed in March 1998, followed by Phase II; 230 missiles were produced during EMD. In February 2002, the Marine Corps signed a contract with Lockheed Martin for the low-rate initial production (LRIP) of 330 Predator systems, with a second LRIP contract for 400 systems signed in January 2003. In October 2003, the Marine Corps announced a decision to cancel further procurement of the system following completion of low-rate production. The system successfully completed first article and lot 1 testing at the Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake, California in December 2003. In June 2004, Lockheed Martin received a contract to refit all 700 remaining SRAW rounds to the FGM-172B SRAW-MPV (Multi-Purpose Variant) configuration with a new multi-purpose blast-fragmentation warhead, converting the system from an anti-armor to a direct-fire urban assault weapon effective against buildings and bunkers, which better fulfilled the needs of the Marines in response to requirements identified during Operation Iraqi Freedom; delivery of the first 400 rounds was completed in May 2005. As of 2005, all the FGM-172A missiles supplied previously to the USMC had been retrofitted with the FGM-172B multi- purpose blast warhead to replace the top attack anti-armor warhead. The Kestrel was a derivative of the Predator for the British Army's Next- generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW). In 2000, the UK Ministry of Defence carried out trials of 13 Kestrels. In May 2002, the Saab Bofors Dynamics MBT- LAW was chosen for the UK NLAW requirement. In 2003, the U.S. Army decided not to adopt a version of the Predator as its MPIM/SRAW (Multipurpose Individual Munition – Short Range Assault Weapon) candidate.John Antal \\"Packing a Punch: America's Man-Portable Antitank Weapons\\" page 88 Military Technology 3/2010, Monch Publishing Former operators * United States Marine Corps ReferencesExternal links * Lockheed Martin video on firing of Predator * Multi-Purpose Individual Munition - Forecast International Category:Anti-tank missiles of the United States Category:United States Marine Corps equipment ","title":"FGM-172 SRAW"},{"id":"3777962","text":"The Chattahoochee Valley Railway was a shortline railroad linking a number of textile mills between West Point, Georgia and McGinty, Alabama for a total distance of .

History Originally the line was constructed by the Chattahoochee Valley Railroad on July 2, 1895 from Langdale to Lanett, and was extended to Riverview by 1897. In 1900, the railroad was reorganized to become the Chattahoochee Valley Railway. Further expansion included new tracks south to Jester in 1899 and north to Standing Rock, Alabama by 1908. By extending tracks further to Bleecker in 1916 the railroad totaled and connected to the Atlanta, Birmingham and Coast Railroad, the West Point Route, and the Central of Georgia. In 1932 part of the railroad was abandoned from Standing Rock to West Point and passenger service ended that same year. In the 1960s, a dam was constructed north of West Point, and the CHV built a short spur line to reach the construction site for delivery of materials. When construction of the dam was completed in 1973 the spur was abandoned. Around the same time, the railroad abandoned the line from Riverview to Bleecker. The railroad shut down completely on September 23, 1992, with tracks removed the following year. By the time of the abandonment the railroad numbered less than .

The Kaimai Ranges are seen behind the memorial New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441 (NZ441) was a scheduled flight of the New Zealand National Airways Corporation from Whenuapai, Auckland to Tauranga. On 3 July 1963 at approximately 9:09 am NZST the flight, a Douglas DC-3 Skyliner, flew into a vertical rock face in the Kaimai Ranges near Mount Ngatamahinerua, at an altitude of 2460 feet (750 m). Twenty-three people were on board. Twenty-two were killed instantly; there is evidence that one person survived the impact but died shortly afterward. Three extra passengers were supposed to be on the flight, but changed their plans at the last minute. According to Civil Aviation Authority investigators, a downdraft carried the aircraft below the level of the crests of the range, where under the very poor weather conditions prevailing at the time, the aircraft encountered an area of extreme turbulence from which it was impossible for the crew to recover altitude. On the day of the crash, another plane was caught in strong downdrafts in the Kaimai Ranges but managed to recover. Furthermore, the crew was probably unaware of the true position of the aircraft and initiated a premature descent. However, it must be appreciated that the crew decided to descend only to the level officially designated as the minimum safe altitude in the area of the descent. Following this accident, the Civil Aviation Authority made the decision to classify the Kaimai Ranges as mountainous terrain, which raised the minimum safe altitude for the area by 1000 feet (305 m). Due to the remoteness of the crash, the wreckage was not recovered but secured on site by the New Zealand Army in 1964. This is similar to New Zealand's other major air disaster, Air New Zealand Flight 901, which remains on the slopes of Mount Erebus in Antarctica where it crashed.

The attacking forces, led by Auda ibu Tayi and advised by T. E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"), were victorious over the Ottoman Empire defenders. Thomas Edward Lawrence – a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia Background Gilbert Clayton had already told Lawrence, \\"The move to Aqaba on the part of Feisal is not at present desirable...\\" This was due to the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence being superseded by the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Lawrence however, decided to go his own way, without orders. Lawrence called it a private venture, void of British support, since \\"Feisal provided money, camels, stores and explosives.\\" The 600-mile desert journey was led by Sherif Nasir, while Lawrence was accompanied by Nesib el-Bekri and Auda Abu Tayi, leader of the northern Howeitat tribe of Bedouin. Total strength on 9 May 1917, when they embarked, was 45 Howeitat and Ageyl camel men. Aqaba was surrounded by mountains north and east, and connected to the interior by Wadi Itm. The long and narrow gorge could be used by the Ottomans to bottle up any British invasion by sea, though it did not stop the Royal Navy from bombarding the site. By 1917, the Ottoman garrison had grown to 300 – mainly Ottoman-Arab gendarmerie – up from 100 in 1914. According to Neil Faulkner, \\"The British high command had long been anxious about Aqaba.\\" The British feared that an Ottoman Aqaba would threaten Archibald Murray's flank, or Ottoman raids could develop into the Sinai, or that it could be used as a base for German submarines in the Red Sea. According to T.E. Lawrence, \\"The Arabs needed Akaba: firstly, to extend their front, which was their tactical principle; and, secondly, to link up with the British.\\" Lawrence also says, \\"I was working out with Auda abu Tayi a march to the Howeitat in their spring pastures of the Syrian desert. From them we might raise a mobile camel force, and rush Akaba from the eastward without guns or machine-guns. The eastern was the unguarded side, the line of least resistance, the easiest for us.\\" Battle and campaign= Prelude  Newcombe and Lawrence contrived to deceive the Turkish army that their objective was an attack on Damascus and Aleppo, drawing attention away from their real goal of Aqaba. The expedition started moving towards Aqaba in May. They lost three men to attacks by snakes in the Wadi Sirhan region, while Nuri Shaalan was paid 6,000 pounds sterling in gold for the use of Wadi Sirhan as a base. While in Bair, Lawrence and Auda decided to attack the rail line in the area of Daraa, to convince the Turks the main Arab force was at Azrak in Sirhan. Finding no suitable targets that far north, Lawrence and Zaal ended up attacking the Atwi station south of Amman, before returning to Bair. Aba al Lasan and Aqaba Three Howeitat clans on Nagb el Shtar, the Dhumaniyeh, the Darausha, and the Dhiabat, aided the effort to secure the pass of Aba el Lissan, along the Maan–Aqaba road. The Dhumaniyeh attacked the Fuweilah blockhouse at the pass while the Arab force under Auda and Lawrence attacked the Ghadir el Haj garrison along the rail line south of Maan, destroying ten bridges. However, the Dhumaniyeh were unable to keep control of the pass when a Turkish relief battalion under Niaz Bey arrived, occupying Aba el Lissan. Auda personally led a charge of 50 horsemen against the Turkish troops on 2 July, while 400 camelmen under Nasir and Lawrence charged into their flank. The result was 300 Turkish casualties and only 160 prisoners, while the Arabs lost two dead. Lawrence was nearly killed in the action after he accidentally shot his camel in the head with his pistol. Auda was hit by six bullets, which destroyed his field glasses, holster, and scabbard; but left him unharmed. Discussing surrender terms, 5 July Three more Turkish posts lay ahead on the way to Aqaba: Guweira, Kethera, and Khadra. Guweira was captured by Sheikh ibn Jad by the time Auda and Lawrence arrived, and the 120 soldiers in that Turkish garrison had become prisoners. Kethira was taken on the night of 4 July, aided by a lunar eclipse. Khadra, at the mouth of the Itm, and its 300-man garrison surrendered on the 6th. Four miles onward, Aqaba and the sea now lay open. Aftermath Arab fighters in Aqaba on 28 February 1918. Autochrome colour photograph. The Arab force had swelled to 2,000 Howeitat by the end of the engagement, and they had taken 700 prisoners, including 42 officers. Auda established an advance post at Guweira with 600 of his clan, which they held for the next month and a half, enough time for the gain of Aqaba to be consolidated, even though the Ottomans were able to retake Abu al- Lissan and Fuweilah. Arab outposts were also established at Nabathean Petra, Delagha, and Batra, along the Maan highlands. Lawrence, accompanied by eight others, traveled 160 miles across the Sinai Peninsula via the Mitla Pass to Suez, in 49 hours. At Ismailia Station, Lawrence convinced Burmester and Admiral Wemyss to send HMIS Dufferin to Aqaba with food, bringing back the prisoners on the return trip. Lawrence then took a train to Cairo. In Cairo, Lawrence reported to Clayton and then Allenby, from whom Lawrence requested arms, supplies, an immediate 16,000 pounds in gold to pay debts incurred, and a further 200,000 sovereigns to support his plans to threaten communications with Jerusalem. Allenby promised Lawrence to do what he could, and subsequently told Robertson, \\"...even the partial success of Captain Lawrence's scheme would seriously disorganise Turkish railway communications south of Aleppo, while its complete success would destroy effectively his only main artery of communication...\\" Aqaba became a major Royal Navy depot, supplying and transporting Feisal's forces upon his arrival on 23 August, as HMS Euryalus and then HMS Humber guarded the port. A landing strip was built at Kuntilla; and by August 4 the Royal Flying Corps was bombing Maan, Abu al- Lissan, and Fuweilah, supplementing continued attacks by Auda on the Hejaz railway. According to Lawrence, \\"In the next four months our experts from Akaba destroyed seventeen locomotives. Traveling became an uncertain terror for the enemy.\\" Popular culture The campaign and battle was depicted in the film Lawrence of Arabia, albeit with some creative liberties taken.

Life Sousa Caldas was born in 1762, to Portuguese merchant Luís Pereira de Sousa and Ana Maria de Sousa. Since he was a small boy, he had a vocation for Letters, and, with only 8 years old, he was sent to Lisbon, to live under the care of an uncle. With 16 years old, he ingressed in the University of Coimbra, where he learnt Mathematics and Canon law. In 1781, he was arrested by the Inquisition because of his ideals, influenced by the Enlightenment. Transferred to the convent of Rilhafoles, he was catechized for six months. After the catechism, he became a fully different person, discovering his sacerdotal vocation. However, he did not abandoned his philosophical and satirical poetry, writing the poem Ode ao Homem Natural in 1784. It is attributed to him the satire O Reino da Estupidez. After graduating in the Canon law course in 1789, he travelled to France and Genoa. In Genoa, he wrote the ode A Criação and abandoned the satirical poetry. In 1801, he returns to Rio de Janeiro in order to visit his mother, settling permanently in the town. During his final years in Rio, he wrote many letters for his friends, but only five of them exist today. He died in 1814.

Until 2015 she was MS Wind Perfection, an accommodation ship owned and operated by C-bed. She was built in 1982 as MS Olau Britannia by Weser Seebeckswerft in Bremerhaven for Olau Line, who used her on Sheerness—Vlissingen service. In 1990 she was sold to Fred. Olsen Lines and renamed MS Bayard for services between Norway and Denmark. In 1991 Fred. Olsen Lines was sold to Color Line and the Bayard passed under their ownership under the name MS Christian IV. In 2008, she was sold to Stella Lines and renamed MS Julia for service between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. This was a failure and after just two months the Julia was laid up. In 2009, she was sold to Fastnet Line and entered service on their Swansea—Cork route in 2010, retaining her earlier name. History=1982–1990: Olau Line 22 September 1985 near Sheerness The Olau Britannia was delivered as the younger sister of MS Olau Hollandia on May 5, 1982. Two days later she was christened by Princess Margaret in Sheerness and placed on the route Sheerness—Vlissingen. In August 1984 the ship collided with the freighter MS Mont Louis in the English channel. Olau Line ordered larger replacements for the Olau Hollandia and Olau Britannia in the late 1980s (which were also named Olau Hollandia and Olau Britannia). In preparation for delivery of its replacement, the first Olau Britannia was sold to Nordström & Thulin, Sweden on October 4, 1989, to be delivered in 1990. However, already on October 11 Nordström & Thulin resold the ship to Fred. Olsen & Co.. Christian IV in Kristiansand. 1990–2008: Fred. Olsen Lines and Color Line In May 1990 the ship was delivered to her new owners and renamed MS Bayard. After a refit at Blohm & Voss, Hamburg, Germany, the Bayard was set in on Kristiansand—Hirtshals route in June 1990. For the winter season she was transferred to Oslo—Hirtshals service. Fred. Olsen sold its Scandinavian ferry operations to Color Line in December 1990, and in January 1991 the Bayard was renamed MS Christian IV. The ship was kept on the Oslo — Hirtshals service until April 1994, when she returned to the Kristiansand — Hirtshals route. In March 1995 the ship temporarily sailed on the Moss—Kiel route, after which she reverted to her older route. The ship was refitted in 1999 at Fredericia Værft in Denmark, with additional restaurants and better conference facilities. She was refitted again in 2005, this time at Remontowa, Gdańsk, Poland. In March 2008 she was replaced by the new on the Kristiansand—Hirsthals route, and laid up at Sandefjord. Between 2008-04-10 and 2008-06-15 the Christian IV sailed on the Larvik—Hirsthals route, replacing – that had been sold to the Mediterranean Shipping Company – until the delivery of the new MS Superspeed 2. 2008: Stella Lines MS Julia in Helsinki in August 2008 On 2008-05-20 the Christian IV was sold by Color Line to Stella Naves Russia (Stella Lines), a subsidiary of the Finnish freight shipping and stevedoring operator Stella Company Group, for €13 million. The ship was delivered to her new owners in July 2008, and subsequently renamed Julia. On 2008-08-01 she entered service on Stella Lines' Helsinki—St. Petersburg route. Passenger numbers on the Julia were low due to the bureaucracy related to applying a visa in order to travel between Finland and Russia. Additionally due to restrictions imposed by the Port of Helsinki the Julia could not carry any freight on the service. On 2008-09-20 the Russian State Duma approved a law change allowing passengers arriving by scheduled ferry services to visit Russia for up to 72 hours without a visa. Despite this legislation change the Helsinki—St. Petersburg service of the Julia was terminated due slower than expected growth of the passenger numbers, failure to acquire additional funding due to the economic crisis of 2008 and larger than expected harbour expenses in St. Petersburg. On 9 October 2008 Stella Lines CEO Kari Juvas stated that the company would make the decisions about the future of the Julia within the next few days. According to Juvas the alternatives are selling the ship or utilizing the ship on a service between Kotka, Finland and Sillamäe, Estonia. Juvas had stated that Stella was interested in operating a ship on the Kotka—Sillamäe route already in July 2007. The Russia-based companies Morskoi Voksal and Inflot, along with the City of St. Petersburg planned on acquiring the share majority of Stella Lines and providing funding for recommencing service on the Helsinki—St. Petersburg route with the Julia. However, on 3 November 2008 it was reported that the City of St. Petersburg had withdrawn from the purchase. On the same date Kim Sjöblom of Stella Lines stated the company are looking for other funders allowing the service to be restarted. These attempts failed and Stella Lines was declared bankrupt on 6 November 2008, with the ownership of the Julia passing to Stella's creditors Aktia Savings Bank. Reportedly several companies have expressed an interest in buying the Julia, but none have been able to raise the capital needed to buy her. On 17 February 2009 it was reported that one of the potential buyers for the Julia is Irish shipowner Frank Allen, who had acquired a loan from a Finnish bank to purchase the ship for use on a service between Cork and Swansea under the brand of B&I; Line, which would be re-established for this service. A public auction to sell the Julia was held on 26 February 2009, but no bids were made. In a second auction held on 12 March 2009 B&I; Line made the highest bid of €6 million, but confusion surrounded the initial undertaking of €1.5 million to secure the ship and she remained unsold. No further auction was held, instead the bankrupt's estate negotiated directly with potential buyers. In addition to B&I; Line, Greek Halkidon Shipping Corporation and two unnamed Finnish companies were reported to have shown interest in the ship.  2012–2015: C-Bed – Wind Perfection  From 2012 the ship was an accommodation ship owned and operated by C-bedhttp://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/cork-ferry-embarks-on-new-life-as- floating-hotel-188891.html and used at West of Duddon Sands Wind Farm and nearby Walney Wind Farm. She was sold in December 2015.  2015– : Moby Line – Moby Zazà  MS Moby Zazà in 2017 Following bankruptcy of former operator, SNCM, Moby Line bought the ferry to operate their new France to Corsica service, together with MV Moby Corse. She started in June 2016, but suffered an electrical fire, whilst at Nice, in August 2016.

The train ran from Monday 6 September 1971 until Sunday 8 June 1979. It replaced the Night Limited express passenger trains which provided a faster service than the ordinary express trains, by stopping at only six intermediate stations en route and not hauling a postal traffic as previous trains had. Designed as a \\"hotel on wheels\\", the service was ultimately unsuccessful and attempts to re-use the rolling stock were thwarted by the presence of asbestos in the carriages. NZR eventually sold the carriages to the Eastern and Oriental Express, where they remain in use. Introduction The train was NZRs attempt to compete with the introduction of jet aircraft for business traffic between Auckland and Wellington. It was intended to improve the Railway's staff morale and image, and the concept was based on a shorter version of New South Wales Government Railways Southern Aurora, with its 75-foot, 20-berth sleeping cars introduced in 1962, providing Pullman-style luxury equal to the last United States trains, the Broadway Limited, the Chief, the Crescent and the Panama Limited. Planning for the new Auckland to Wellington overnight express began in 1963, and the concept of the train, as 31 stainless steel cars (two trainsets each night) of five \\"twinette\\" cars, five single-berth sleepers (16 beds per car), a licensed buffet car and a power car, never changed. The public announcement of plans for the new train was made in December 1965The Dominion 20-12-65 Extensive study was made of other early 1960s Australian overnight trains, particularly the Queensland Rail Sunlander, the Victorian Railways/South Australian Railways Overland, and similar designs in the United States, such as the final Santa Fe Railroad 'High-Level' and Burlington Railroad carriages. New Zealand built carriages were estimated by NZR Chief Mechanical Engineer, J. Black in 1958, to cost NZ£25,000 pounds for a second-class carriage and £35,000 for a first-class carriage.NZR CME. Lightweight Rollingstock 8 June 1960. File 65/327 NZ National Archives By 1960, NZR had concluded that stainless steel carriages, which reduced maintenance costs, including avoiding the need to paint were preferable, even though this was at a cost premium of 12–20%. That meant in 1970 a per-carriage cost of $100,000+ for Japanese or Australian stainless steel construction, with $60,000 to $70,000 for conventional Italian or Swedish-built first-class carriages. In 1941 NZR built 31-seat first-class carriages at a cost of £7,140 and second-class, 56-seat carriages at a cost of £5,920 per carriage.NZR CME 22/12/64 In 1967 the new train was promoted by Minister of Railways, J.B. Gordon, on the grounds that it would deliver a clear return on its purchase cost and operation. Most equivalent overseas passenger rail services ceased that year and following the US Postal Service ending its use of almost all North American rail passenger services for first class mail in September 1967—Santa Fe applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to withdraw 33 out of 39 of the long-distance express passenger trains they ran.G. Glischinski. Santa Fe Railway. Voyageur Press & MBI publishing (2008) p154 That is, all but the Los Angeles-Chicago Super Chief and its Frisco connection, the Texas Chief (Chicago-Houston), its Dallas connection, and two Los Angeles-San Diego locals. Nevertheless, approval for NZR to release tenders for the new train was made on 19 November 1968. The order for the train was placed with mid-1969 with Hitachi and Nippon Sharyo. The Silver Star carriages were distinctive in New Zealand. Rather than being painted in the traditional red, carriages were made of unpainted stainless steel. Original planning for the train envisaged the sleeping cars as the basis of new-standard NZR passenger stock with future passenger trains of six carriages and van, seven stainless steel units of 30 tons each (210 tons) hauled by a DA class locomotive. However, planning for this replacement for the limited express became more ambitious in the early 1960s, moving away from 25-ton, 55-foot stainless steel cars of the type used on the Queensland Rail Sunlander to sleeping cars with a 9 ft 9 in loading gauge. As a result, the usual Silver Star consisted of 35-ton cars would weigh 410 tons and contribute to NZR's requirement for DX class locomotive to haul them as well as express freight trains on the NIMT. This required a large track side work project on the NIMT and on the Silver Star's alternative route via the Stratford–Okahukura Line, to accommodate greater width cars.  Withdrawal  The Silver Star service broke new ground in New Zealand by providing a full onboard crew of car stewards (sourced from the inter-island rail ferry service) who doubled as dining car staff at meal times. A great deal of study had been made of on train meal provision, particularly of German and British Rail. The high wage and other industrial demands of the ferry stewards were one of the reasons the service failed, however, the product was effectively ten years too late. Travel by National Airways Corporation Boeing 737 between Auckland and Wellington took just over one hour; the Silver Star, by contrast, taking around 12 hours and 30 minutes, thus the business market was lost. Due to the freeze on rail fares and charges imposed by the Kirk Labour Government, which effectively meant the price from Wellington to Auckland was held at $18 from late 1971 to early 1976, use of the train was high in 1974-75 and 1975-76. In the late 1970s, the usual overnight patronage was only about 65 on most runs and only half the carriage stock was used for most of the year except during a few airline strikes. In March 1979, the General Manager of NZR, Trevor Hayward, in his booklet Time for Change noted that the average subsidy per passenger on the Silver Star was $20.00, then a substantial amount of money. The service was withdrawn not long after on Sunday 10 June 1979.  Rolling Stock and motive power  The 31 cars were manufactured by Hitachi and Nippon Sharyo and hauled by diesel-electric locomotives (initially two DA class, and later one DX class) for a six-night-per-week service. All passengers were accommodated in sleeping cars, with 12 of these cars being designated \\"Twinette\\" (8 x two-berth cabins incorporating separate bathrooms/showers for each cabin) and 12 being \\"Roomette\\" cars (16 x single- berth cabins with toilet and basin facilities). Passengers could purchase dinner, breakfast and other refreshments during the night, including alcoholic beverages and souvenirs in the buffet car, of which three were built, with 42 alcove-style tables. Four power and baggage vans completed the fleet. The cars were long and wide. Bogies All 31 cars ran on bogies of a newer design, classed X28250 by NZR, which offered a superior quality ride through inertial dampers and better suspension, and bore a resemblance to the Kinki-Sharyo- manufactured bogies, classed X27250 by NZR, under steam and postal vans built by Kinki. The bogies built especially for the Northerner trains four years later and the FM-class guards vans two to six years after that, and classed X28280, were heavily modelled on those under the Silver Star. Replacement New Zealand Railways at the time also ran another overnight train service, (the Night Express) which stopped at more than twice the number of stations than the Silver Star did, which had much older rolling stock, and which had no onboard buffet service. It did have cheaper fares and three classes of accommodation. By refurbishing this train in 1975, to become the Northerner, many rail passengers had the option to pay around 33% less for a large reclining seat or 15% less for a 2-berth sleeper cabin without shower or toilet, than pay for a Silver Star cabin. The Railways Department attempted to replace the Northerner and Silver Star with a refurbished version which would be a 50% seating and 50% sleeper train. This plan would include the redeployment of eight 30-seat cars from the Northerner fleet to the Wellington-Napier Endeavour service, and relocation of the three 32-seat and three 36-seat Endeavour cars onto the Christchurch-Picton route. These plans, however, came to nothing after the Silver Star stock was withdrawn from service and blue asbestos insulation was found inside the coaches. The union workforce refused to work with the dangerous material, and the cars lay parked in sidings for over ten years while their future was debated. In 1982, Minister of Railways, George Gair, facing a cost of $7 million for the asbestos removal and modernisation of the carriages, as well as rail losses and demand for other new rail equipment, commissioned Boston consultants, Booz Allen & Hamilton, to review NZR and in particular to investigate the most economical way of providing rail passenger options. The Ministry of Transport refused to accept NZR estimate that the rebuilt Silver Star would exceed the Northerner's patronage by 60% and operate profitablyT. Hayward, CME, NZR to G. Gair Minister of Railways, 1 July 1983. National Archives The Railways then suggested that higher utilisation of the rebuilt Silver Star cars would be achieved by using them on both night and day services on the NIMT allowing Silver Fern railcars, to be redeployed on other routes. In 1985 Minister of Railways, Richard Prebble delayed a decision, and—with the full expected cost of removing the blue asbestos and reconstructing the train having reached $20million—cancelled the conversion in line with the Booz Allen Report, which found modern railcar train-sets vastly more economical than small locomotive- hauled trains. By 1986, the NZR general manager considered the conversion of the Silver Star into a seating-only train as an uneconomical way of renewing the Northerner or Endeavour trains. In December 1987, the Silver Star cars were hauled from Wellington to Auckland, where private tourist firm Pacific Trailways intended to convert 27 of them into a luxury tourist train that would travel around both the North and South Islands for NZ$1,000 per passenger. Nothing eventuated and all the cars languished in Auckland for two more years. In 1990, the 31-car fleet was purchased by the British luxury travel company, Orient-Express Trains & Cruises (an off-shoot of Orient- Express Hotels) and taken to A & G Price, of Thames, for regauging from New Zealand's gauge to gauge for Thai and Malaysian railway lines. 24 cars (19 sleepers, three buffet cars and two power vans) went to Singapore where an extensive internal rebuild and fit-out, as well as exterior painting and badging, was undertaken by the new owners at their (then) newly-constructed maintenance depot on KTMB land in Singapore's Keppel Road rail yards. A 25th car also went to Singapore, and was stored unrefurbished for some years, but was scrapped when E&O; moved its engineering workshop from Singapore to Johor. Since then the refurbished consist has operated a regular 5-star luxury cruise-train service between Singapore (now the Woodlands customs terminal on the island's northern coast) and Bangkok as the Eastern & Oriental Express. Six cars subsequently remained (still owned by Orient-Express) at A & G Price in Thames; two Twinettes, two Roomettes, and two power vans. They had had their interiors stripped, asbestos removed, and were no longer on bogies, and put up for sale from December 2012 until 2016. All six were sold to individual buyers.

While there, he frequented the Museo del Prado, where he made and sold copies of works by the Old Masters. Afterward, influenced by his friend, the sculptor Paco Durrio, he went to Paris where he mingled with other Spanish artists of his generation, such as Ignacio Zuloaga and Santiago Rusiñol, with whom he shared an apartment on Île Saint-Louis. He held his first exhibition in 1897. During his stay there, his work increasingly began to display elements of Impressionism, although they continued to be based on classical Spanish styles. Upon returning to Spain, he spent some time in Segovia, where he shared a studio with Zuloaga, in the workshop of his uncle, the ceramicist Daniel Zuloaga. Eventually, he married and settled in Elgeta Gipuzkoa.Brief biography from the Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia. Later, he and Zuloaga collaborated on murals at the casino in Bermeo (destroyed by a flood in 1983). From 1924 to 1925, he visited the United States and Cuba, where he held several showings. During his final years, he concentrated on portraits, including a posthumous one of Karl Marx on the fiftieth anniversary of his death. Uranga died in San Sebastián, aged 73.

During the 1960s, he worked mostly as a visual artist, associated with the international Fluxus-movement. As a television writer, director, and actor he is responsible for some of the most notable and controversial shows on Dutch televisions from the 1960s to the 1990s, creating a number of lasting characters and enriching the language with terms and expressions first coined in his shows. In addition, he voiced the characters of Ernie and Kermit the Frog on the Dutch version of Sesame Street. For his shows, he has written over three hundred songs, and his reputation has changed from being Dutch television's \\"enfant terrible\\" to an acknowledged master in a variety of genres. Biography=Early career: visual arts Schippers, born in Groningen, grew up in Bussum and studied at the Kunstnijverheidsschool (later the Gerrit Rietveld Academie) in Amsterdam but did not graduate. He began a career as a visual artist in the early 1960s, influenced by dada and artists as Marcel Duchamp and Kurt Schwitters, participating in a number of Fluxus events, such as a section for the television program Signalement in 1963, in which he poured a bottle of lemonade in the North Sea. Willem Sandberg invited him and Ger van Elk to exhibit in Museum Fodor; among other things, they covered one floor with broken glass and one with kitchen salt. With Willem de Ridder and others he manufactured paper installations on the VARA television show Signalement that was ridiculed in the press in December 1963, and published a full-page enumeration of types of meat balls in 1965 in Vrij Nederland, already displaying his love for absurdist humor and language games that marked his later career. His first stint in television gained him notoriety along with the rest of the crew of the VPRO television show Hoepla (1967) when actress Phil Bloom became the first woman to appear nude on television. That show was quickly canceled, and Schippers returned to visual arts. Throughout the 1960s Schippers' work was popular with the director of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Willem Sandberg, who bought many of his drawings and collages. Sandberg's successor, , did invite Schippers for a solo show, but did not consider him a serious enough artist. A notable work was the Pindakaasvloer (\\"Peanut butter platform\\"), a floor covered with peanut butter. The concept dated from 1962, but it was first realized in 1969 in Loenersloot. The work was redone in 1997 in the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, and again in a gallery in 2010. Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam bought the concept in 2010 and installed it in 2011; at least three visitors accidentally walked onto the 4 by 12-meter floor, and Schippers fielded more than 500 video questions on the blog Pindakaaspost. Radio and television Schippers returned to VPRO television in 1971, writing De Fred Haché Show, with The Hague comedian Harry Touw as the character Fred Haché, directed by Schippers and Ruud van Hemert, Gied Jaspars, and Wim van der Linden. His girlfriend Ellen Jens produced the show, and worked with Schippers throughout his television career. Subsequently, he wrote Barend is weer bezig (which ran for five episodes) for the Hachéshows character Barend Servet (played by IJf Blokker). The two shows were closely related (Schippers also designed the sets for both), and featured absurdist comedy which included the kinds of low-brow content not allowed to be seen or heard on Dutch television— dog poop, nudity, profanity. Controversy arose over a skit in which Barend Servet interviewed Juliana of the Netherlands (played by \\"Ria\\"); the queen drank sherry and cleaned Brussel sprouts to pretend to feel close to the Dutch people, before throwing them in the trash or donating them to a children's home. The show led to questions being asked in parliament about the depiction of her majesty, and the VPRO was censured by the minister of culture, narrowly escaping having its broadcasting hours cut. For another character from the two shows, Sjef van Oekel (played by Dolf Brouwers), Schippers wrote Van Oekel's Discohoek (1974). It was a breakthrough for Brouwers (already 61 at the time), a former tour guide and hairdresser who had always aspired to becoming a star. Brouwers scored a few minor hits with songs from the show, and later became the main character in a series of comics by Theo van den Boogaard. Brouwers was also the lead in the 1978 television show Het is weer zo laat!, in which he played Waldo van Dungen, a part-time waiter in a night club who becomes its owner after a rich woman (Gé Braadslee, played by Mimi Kok) falls in love with him and buys the club for him. The show also included characters that would return in later shows, such as Boy Bensdorp (Rob van Houten) and Jan Vos (Clous van Mechelen). The night club, \\"Waldolala\\", provided Schippers the opportunity for more chaotic scenes, controversial nudity, and double entendres. In the 1980s, Schippers wrote, directed, and acted in the VPRO shows De lachende scheerkwast, Opzoek naar Yolanda, and We zijn weer thuis. From 1984 to 1991 he had a radio show, Ronflonflon met Jacques Plafond. By the 1990s his early shows were collected by museums as video art, he had been awarded many times, winning the Lira award for television drama, and had graduated from being the \\"enfant terrible\\" of Dutch television to \\"an appreciated master in various genres\\". Many of the word jokes and catch phrases from his television and radio shows have found their way into the Dutch language—examples cited are \\"Jammer maar helaas\\" (\\"Pity, but unfortunate\\", Jacques Plafond), \\"Reeds!\\" (\\"Already!\\", Sjef van Oekel), \\"Pollens!\\" (untranslatable, Plafond), \\"Peu nerveu\\" (verbatim from French, \\"a bit nervous\\", Plafond), \\"Verdomd interessant, maar gaat u verder\\" (\\"that's damn interesting, but please continue\\", Plafond). Of all Dutch artists, in terms of contributions to the language he is only preceded by Marten Toonder, Kees van Kooten, and Wim de Bie, according to the book Verdomd Interessant, Maar Gaat U Verder: De Taal van Wim T. Schippers (2000). In addition, he estimates having written over three hundred songs for his television shows. Plays Schippers made three television plays for the VPRO, ' (1976), Sans rancune (1987), and De bruine jurk (1988). In 1986 he drew international attention as theater director with Going to the Dogs, a 46-minute play that premiered in the Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam and featured six Alsatian dogs reading newspapers, watching TV, barking at the screen when they saw another dog on it, and occasionally relieving themselves. The drama on stage continued the absurdity of his television work, but the real play, according to Schippers, was the audience watching dogs on a stage. Since Going to the Dogs he has periodically returned to the stage, with Wuivend graan (2007) (nominated for the Toneel Publieksprijs, an audience award), Wat nu weer (2009), and most recently Het laatste nippertje (2011). Voice work Schippers has voice-acted Ernie, Kermit the Frog, Guy Smiley, and Count Von Count on Sesamstraat, the Dutch co- production of Sesame Street, ever since its first season in 1976. With Paul Haenen, who does the voice of Bert, he wrote and recorded a slew of Bert and Ernie albums. He is also the voice of Happy in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the Dutch dub from 1984. Visual arts After de Wilde, director of the Stedelijk Museum, turned Schippers down, he returned only intermittently to the visual arts. He had an exposition of prints in the Stedelijk in 1970, accompanied by a rather puzzling text in the program, after which the relationship between him and the museum remained strained. Notable (and monumental) art projects of his include Torentje van Drienerlo (1979), in which the top of a tower rises above an artificial lake, suggesting the rest is underwater, and the \\"marriage room\\" in the Amsterdam Stopera (1988). Schippers' art work is praised for its sense of humor; when a dozen journalists stood pensively around the peanut butter platform, Schippers cried out, \\"Isn't this fantastic! We're all watching peanut butter!\\" For his combined achievements in painting and writing, he was awarded the Jacobus van Looy prize in 2005.

It is located in The Lakes, an unincorporated community in Murray County a few miles north-northwest of Currie. The name Shetek is derived from \\"pelican\\" in the Ojibwe language. Since large lakes are rare in southwestern Minnesota and for some distance over the borders into Iowa and South Dakota, Lake Shetek is a significant regional draw for water recreation. Lake Shetek State Park lies on its eastern shore. Geography Lake Shetek covers to a maximum depth of just . This modest depth is wholly typical for the Prairie Pothole Region. The shoreline totals , about 85% of which is in private development. The watershed-to-lake ratio is 23:1, with much of that watershed under cultivation. Lake Shetek is by far the largest of Murray County's hundred or so lakes. The next largest is currently Lake Sarah just to the northwest. Great Oasis Lake at was once second-largest but was drained in the early 20th century for farmland. It is the headwaters of the West Fork of the Des Moines River, considered the river's main fork. Lake Shetek contains three main islands: Valhalla, Keeley, and Loon Islands. Causeways connect the first two to the western shore, and another connects the third to the eastern shore. Shetek also connects to Bloody Lake Fremont Lake and Armstrong Slough. Geology Lake Shetek and the surrounding landscape of wetlands and rolling hills are the result of glaciation. The lake lies on the Altamont Moraine, a terminal moraine marking the farthest extent of an ice lobe during the Wisconsin glaciation. This most- recent glaciation deposited a very thick blanket of till over the area. Lake Shetek began forming as the climate started to warm 15,000 years ago. Water from the melting glaciers carved channels into the moraine. Where one channel—now occupied by Beaver Creek—intersected the channel now occupied by the Des Moines River, a buildup of sediment and slumping banks partially dammed the outflow, creating a large, shallow lake. Flora and fauna Lake Shetek has long harbored a robust population of rough fish, native but economically undesirable. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources commenced fish stocking in 1987, introducing game fish such as walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, crappie, sunfish, and black bass. Aquatic vegetation is sparse, which is typical for lakes in the region. Due to its shallowness, the entire basin constitutes the littoral zone, which harbors common invertebrates like snails and insect larvae. Five common species of waterfowl all breed on Lake Shetek: the American coot, gadwall, mallard, northern shoveler, and ruddy duck. White pelicans, the lake's namesake, are often seen during migration. History The earliest humans around Lake Shetek were likely following the bison that came there to drink. Archaeologists identify the first permanent inhabitants as members of the Great Oasis culture. French explorer Joseph Nicollet camped beside the lake for three days in 1838. He noted that the region's Dakota people called the lake Rabechy, meaning \\"place where pelicans nest.\\" However his journals and maps opted for the Ojibwe language equivalent, which was already in use by voyageurs. Pioneers established a small settlement along the east shore of Lake Shetek in the late 1850s. However the Dakota War of 1862 broke out and 15 settlers were killed and a dozen taken captive at Slaughter Slough. Euro- American settlement was dampened for a while, but within a decade Archibald and Neil Currie built a flour mill and a general store near the lake's outlet, from which grew the town of Currie. One of the WPA-built causeways Two summer resorts opened on Lake Shetek in the early 20th century, Tepeeotah on the east shore and Valhalla Pavilion on Valhalla Island. Two excursion boats carried visitors around the lake. To protect fishing and recreation interests, locals prompted the state Game and Fish Department to stabilize the water level with a dam in the mid-1920s. This initial tourist economy peaked in the Roaring Twenties and subsided with Valhalla Pavilion burning down in 1928 and the onset of the Great Depression. To combat unemployment during the Depression, the federal government authorized several job creation programs to conduct public work projects. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) arrived in 1934 with an ambitious plan to build a road system across Lake Shetek and a state park on the wooded eastern shore. From their camp on Keeley Island the WPA men built five causeways running from island to island. However the program was disbanded in 1940 with the sixth and final causeway incomplete. The Tepeeotah Resort closed in the 1960s just as housing subdivisions burgeoned around the shore of Lake Shetek. Although the shoreline was greatly developed, better runoff management practices throughout the watershed improved Shetek's water quality. A portion of the Casey Jones State Trail was constructed in the 1990s between the lake and nearby Currie. Issues As a shallow lake with a fairly high watershed-to-basin ratio, Lake Shetek can be strongly affected by environmental issues. Maintaining the water level has been a local concern for decades. The lake was dammed in the 1920s, then raised another in the 1930s. Additional improvements were made to the dam in 1966 and 1995. Siltation from human activities has been slowly filling in the lake. In 1973 Shetek's deepest point was documented at whereas today it is only . Surface runoff from farms and lawns threatens to carry in excessive nutrients that can cause algal blooms. Moreover the shallow lake freezes solid every seven years on average. This leads to significant winter fishkill, and since rough fish like carp rebound faster than desirable game fish, it has been a struggle to maintain the sport fishery.

Seurat and the Science of Painting. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1964. By requiring the viewer to combine the colors optically instead of physically mixing pigments, Divisionists believed they were achieving the maximum luminosity scientifically possible. Georges Seurat founded the style around 1884 as chromoluminarism, drawing from his understanding of the scientific theories of Michel Eugène Chevreul, Ogden Rood and Charles Blanc, among others. Divisionism developed along with another style, Pointillism, which is defined specifically by the use of dots of paint and does not necessarily focus on the separation of colors.Ratliff, Floyd. Paul Signac and Color in Neo- Impressionism. New York: Rockefeller UP, 1992. . Theoretical foundations and development Divisionism developed in nineteenth-century painting as artists discovered scientific theories of vision that encouraged a departure from the tenets of Impressionism, which at that point had been well-developed. The scientific theories and rules of color contrast that would guide composition for Divisionists placed the movement of Neo-Impressionism in contrast with Impressionism, which is characterized by the use of instinct and intuition. Scientists or artists whose theories of light or color had some impact on the development of Divisionism include Charles Henry, Charles Blanc, David Pierre Giottino Humbert de Superville, David Sutter, Michel Eugène Chevreul, Ogden Rood and Hermann von Helmholtz. Beginnings with Georges Seurat=Paul Signac and other artists Divisionism, along with the Neo-Impressionism movement as a whole, found its beginnings in Georges Seurat's masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Seurat had received classical training at the École des Beaux-Arts, and, as such, his initial works reflected the Barbizon style. In 1883, Seurat and some of his colleagues began exploring ways to express as much light as possible on the canvasSutter, Jean. The Neo Impressionists. Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1970. . By 1884, with the exhibition of his first major work, Bathing at Asnières, as well as croquetons of the island of La Grande Jatte, his style began taking form with an awareness of Impressionism, but it was not until he finished La Grande Jatte in 1886 that he established his theory of chromoluminarism. In fact, La Grande Jatte was not initially painted in the Divisionist style, but he reworked the painting in the winter of 1885-86, enhancing its optical properties in accordance with his interpretation of scientific theories of color and lightSmith, Paul. Seurat, Georges. Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online Color theory Charles Blanc's Grammaire des arts du dessin introduced Seurat to the theories of color and vision that would inspire chromoluminarism. Blanc's work, drawing from the theories of Michel Eugène Chevreul and Eugène Delacroix, stated that optical mixing would produce more vibrant and pure colors than the traditional process of mixing pigments. Mixing pigments physically is a subtractive process with cyan, magenta, and yellow being the primary colors. On the other hand, if colored light is mixed together, an additive mixture results, a process in which the primary colors are red, green and blue. The optical mixture which characterized Divisionism — the process of mixing color by juxtaposing pigments — is different from either additive or subtractive mixture, although combining colors in optical mixture functions the same way as additive mixture, i.e. the primary colors are the same. In reality, Seurat's paintings did not actually achieve true optical mixing; for him, the theory was more useful for causing vibrations of color to the viewer, where contrasting colors placed near each other would intensify the relationship between the colors while preserving their singular separate identity. In Divisionist color theory, artists interpreted the scientific literature through making light operate in one of the following contexts: ;Local color: As the dominant element of the painting, local color refers to the true color of subjects, e.g. green grass or blue sky. ;Direct sunlight: As appropriate, yellow-orange colors representing the sun's action would be interspersed with the natural colors to emulate the effect of direct sunlight. ;Shadow: If lighting is only indirect, various other colors, such as blues, reds and purples, can be used to simulate the darkness and shadows. ;Reflected light: An object which is adjacent to another in a painting could cast reflected colors onto it. ;Contrast: To take advantage of Chevreul's theory of simultaneous contrast, contrasting colors might be placed in close proximity. Seurat's theories intrigued many of his contemporaries, as other artists seeking a reaction against Impressionism joined the Neo-Impressionist movement. Paul Signac, in particular, became one of the main proponents of divisionist theory, especially after Seurat's death in 1891. In fact, Signac's book, D’Eugène Delacroix au Néo-Impressionnisme, published in 1899, coined the term Divisionism and became widely recognized as the manifesto of Neo- Impressionism. Divisionism in France and Northern Europe In addition to Signac, other French artists, largely through associations in the Société des Artistes Indépendants, adopted some Divisionist techniques, including Camille and Lucien Pissarro, Albert Dubois-Pillet, Charles Angrand, Maximilien Luce, Henri-Edmond Cross and Hippolyte Petitjean. Additionally, through Paul Signac's advocacy of Divisionism, an influence can be seen in some of the works of Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay and Pablo Picasso.Rapetti Rodolphe Signac, Paul Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online In 1907 Metzinger and Delaunay were singled out by the critic Louis Vauxcelles as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.Ruhrberg, Karl. \\"Seurat and the Neo- Impressionists\\". Art of the 20th Century, Vol. 2. Cologne: Taschen, 1998. . Both artists had develop a new sub-style that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Piet Mondrian, Jan Sluijters and Leo Gestel, in the Netherlands, developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The Futurists later (1909–1916) would adapt the style, in part influenced by Gino Severini's Parisian experience (from 1907), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.Robert Herbert, Neo- Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968 Divisionism in Italy The influence of Seurat and Signac on some Italian painters became evident in the First Triennale in 1891 in Milan. Spearheaded by Grubicy de Dragon, and codified later by Gaetano Previati in his Principi scientifici del divisionismo of 1906, a number of painters mainly in Northern Italy experimented to various degrees with these techniques. Pellizza da Volpedo applied the technique to social (and political) subjects; in this he was joined by Morbelli and Longoni. Among Pellizza's Divisionist works were Speranze deluse (1894) and Il sole nascente (1904).Il Sole Nascente is found at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome. It was, however, in the subject of landscapes that divisionism found strong advocates, including Giovanni Segantini, Gaetano Previati, Angelo Morbelli and Matteo Olivero. Further adherents in painting genre subjects were Plinio Nomellini, Rubaldo Merello, Giuseppe Cominetti, Camillo Innocenti, Enrico Lionne, and Arturo Noci. Divisionism was also in important influence in the work of Futurists Gino Severini (Souvenirs de Voyage, 1911); Giacomo Balla (Arc Lamp, 1909);Arc Lamp is found in Museum of Modern Art, New York Carlo Carrà (Leaving the scene, 1910); and Umberto Boccioni (The City Rises, 1910).The City Rises is also found in the MoMADerived from paragraph in Associazione Pellizza da Volpedo , which cites Enciclopedia dell'arte, Milano (Garzanti) 2002, and also see Voci del Divisionismo italiano in Bollettino Anisa, N. 12 Anno XIX, n. 1, May 2000. Criticism and controversy Divisionism quickly received both negative and positive attention from art critics, who generally either embraced or condemned the incorporation of scientific theories in the Neo- Impressionist techniques. For example, Joris-Karl Huysmans spoke negatively of Seurat's paintings, saying \\"Strip his figures of the colored fleas that cover them, underneath there is nothing, no thought, no soul, nothing\\".Rewald, John. Seurat: a biography. New York: H.N. Abrams, 1990. . Leaders of Impressionism, such as Monet and Renoir, refused to exhibit with Seurat, and even Camille Pissarro, who initially supported Divisionism, later spoke negatively of the technique. While most divisionists did not receive much critical approval, some critics were loyal to the movement, including notably Félix Fénéon, Arsène Alexandre and Antoine de la Rochefoucauld. Scientific misconceptions Although Divisionist artists strongly believed their style was founded in scientific principles, some people believe that there is evidence that Divisionists misinterpreted some basic elements of optical theory.Lee, Alan. \\"Seurat and Science.\\" Art History 10 (June 1987): 203-24. For example, one of these misconceptions can be seen in the general belief that the Divisionist method of painting allowed for greater luminosity than previous techniques. Additive luminosity is only applicable in the case of colored light, not juxtaposed pigments; in reality, the luminosity of two pigments next to each other is just the average of their individual luminosities. Furthermore, it is not possible to create a color using optical mixture which could not also be created by physical mixture. Logical inconsistencies can also be found with the Divisionist exclusion of darker colors and their interpretation of simultaneous contrast.

The incumbent local exchange carrier for the 204 and 431 area codes is Bell MTS. In 2009 the Canadian Numbering Administrator forecast that area code 204 would be exhausted within a few years, even though there are only 1.2 million people in the entire province. While an area code provides a maximum of 7.8 million numbers, Canada uses an allocation scheme which allots all 10,000 numbers of an entire central office prefix to competitive local exchange carriers even for the smallest hamlets, rather than implementing methods of number pooling. Once a number is allocated to a rate centre, it is not possible to reassign it elsewhere, even when a rate centre has more than enough numbers to service it. This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers. As in most of Canada, the number allocation problem was exacerbated by the proliferation of cell phones, particularly in and around Winnipeg. In July 2010, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved a province-wide overlay with area code 431, for implementation in November 2012. On July 30, 2012, 10-digit dialing became mandatory throughout the province. Although this had the effect of allocating 15.6 million numbers to a province of just over 1.2 million people, MTS and other carriers in the province preferred this method to a geographical split that would have seen one part of the province retain 204 and another part receive 431 as a new area code. The province's telephone companies wanted to spare Manitobans, particularly in rural areas, the expense and burden of changing telephone numbers.

His chief function was to catch mice, in which role he was the successor to Peta. In life he had been referred to as \\"the best mouser in Britain\\", as befitted his role.  History and career  Wilberforce was still a kitten when he was adopted from the Hounslow branch of the RSPCA in 1973. This was while Edward Heath was Prime Minister. He was appointed the Office Manager's cat, with a living allowance for his care. The black-and-white cat turned out to be a very good mouser. The policeman on security duty at the front door of Number 10 had instructions to ring the bell for Wilberforce whenever he wanted to come indoors. According to Bernard Ingham, the former press secretary to Margaret Thatcher, Wilberforce was a normal cat for whom Thatcher once bought \\"a tin of sardines in a Moscow supermarket\\". On the BBC coverage of the 1983 general election, presenter Esther Rantzen was allowed to hold Wilberforce and introduce him to viewers. Wilberforce retired in 1986, after 13 years of loyal service. He went to live with a retired caretaker from No. 10 in the country. He died in his sleep on 19 May 1988.

Founded in 1981, it presents an annual season of three to four fully staged productions. Its primary performance venue is the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. History The company was founded in 1981 (with its first performances in 1983) by husband and wife team Nathaniel Merrill and Louise Sherman, who came to Denver from long careers at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. They had hoped that opera would flourish in Denver, but there was no suitable venue, and performances were given in the in-the-round Boettcher Hall, a part of in the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and used primarily as a concert hall. In spite of the location, many international opera stars appeared in Denver. These included Plácido Domingo, Catherine Malfitano, James McCracken, and Pilar Lorengar in the first season. Following seasons have seen Justino Diaz, Eva Marton, Cornell MacNeil, James Morris, Sherrill Milnes, and Samuel Ramey appear in Opera Colorado productions. James Robinson was appointed Artistic Director of the company in 2000. Robinson's work has been seen at many opera houses including New York City Opera, Santa Fe Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Los Angeles Opera, and Opera Ireland. Peter Russell joined Opera Colorado in 2001 as the new President and General Director after leading the Lindemann Young Artist Program at the Metropolitan Opera and serving as the Director of the Wolf Trap Opera Company. With his appointment, Robinson went about re- configuring the hall to provide a three-quarter thrust stage which also required the use of microphones. As Russell noted: \\"if you tried to sing in that big cavern of a space without amplification, the voices would simply go nowhere\\".Chris Shull, \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", Opera Now, London, January/February 2006. However, beginning in September 2005, Opera Colorado moved its performances to the new Ellie Caulkins Opera House. The move to a house more suitable for the presentation of opera led to increases in the donor base and subscribers. It also allowed Opera Colorado to work with other companies on co-productions in ways which were not possible before. As Russell noted, the effect of the new opera house \\"changed the complexion of this opera company in a way that is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience\\". In August 2007, Russell and Robinson announced their resignations from Opera Colorado, and Greg Carpenter was named the new General Director. Prior to joining Opera Colorado, Carpenter worked as the Manager of Development with the National Symphony Orchestra at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. During the 2007-2008 season, the company celebrated its 25th anniversary. The season opened in November with a gala celebration featuring a performance by Patti Lupone followed by performances of Verdi's La traviata, Donizetti's Don Pasquale, and a concert performance of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman starring James Morris. The season concluded with Adams' Nixon in China. In 2009, Opera Colorado was awarded the Downtown Denver Partnership Award, \\"for 25 years of contributing to the vibrancy and diversity of Downtown Denver's performing arts environment.\\"Denver Business Journal, \\"Winners named in 2009 Downtown Denver Partnership awards\\", 27 April 2009 In the same year, the Bonfils-Stanton Foundation announced that Carpenter would receive a 2009 Livingston Fellowship. The Livingston Fellowships, each providing up to $25,000, are intended to give promising leaders in the nonprofit sector the opportunity for advanced study, research, and professional development.Bonfils-Stanton Foundation, The Livingston Fellowship Program 2009 Opera Colorado's 2009-2010 Season opened on 7 November 2009 with a new co- production of Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. This first production of Hoffmann by Opera Colorado in 25 years starred Julian Gavin in the title role with soprano Pamela Armstrong as Olympia, Antonia, Giulietta and Stella, and Gaetan Laperriere as the four villains. The sets and costumes, designed by Andre Barbe, were created in cooperation with Opera Theatre of St. Louis and Boston Lyric Opera. Education and outreach In addition to performances in the theatre, education and outreach performances have been given in countless schools, community centers, assisted living facilities in the Denver metro. Since 2002, Opera Colorado's education programs have grown dramatically. By 2009 Opera Colorado was serving over 43,000 students and adults throughout the state annually. Programs serving students include touring school programs such as Richard Wargo's The Music Shop and Charles Gounod's Romeo and Juliet as well as residency programs, in-school workshops, masterclasses and field trips to the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. For adults, Opera Colorado provides opportunities to meet the artists in their productions, pre-opera lectures and broadcast programs created in cooperation with Colorado Public Radio (broadcast on 88.1 FM KVOD).

They overlay the existing area codes, 604 and 250, simultaneously, requiring ten-digit dialling throughout the province. The area codes also serve the United States community of Hyder, Alaska, which sits along the Canada–United States border near the town of Stewart. History Area code 604 had served as British Columbia's sole area code for 53 years before 250 was created as the area code for Vancouver Island and the Interior in 1997, with 604 cut back to serve Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. This was intended as a long-term solution; however, within four years, 604 was on the brink of exhaustion once again due to Canada's number allocation system. Every competitive local exchange carrier is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers—corresponding to a single prefix—for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even in the smallest hamlets. While most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers, a number cannot be allocated elsewhere once assigned to a rate centre and carrier. This results in thousands of wasted numbers. While numbers tended to be used up fairly quickly in the immediate Vancouver area due to its rapid growth, the number allocation problem was particularly severe in the Lower Mainland, which is home to most of the province's landlines and cell phones. To solve this problem, area code 778 was created on November 3, 2001, as a concentrated overlay for the two largest regional districts in the Lower Mainland, Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley Regional District. The rest of the Lower Mainland continued to use only 604.NANP Planning Letter PL-246 Nonetheless, the implementation of 778 made 10-digit dialing mandatory across the Lower Mainland. In early 2007, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) faced the prospect that 250 would exhaust in early 2008. Relief proposals included: * a geographic split that would have seen the Interior retain 250, with Vancouver Island switching to a new area code * expanding 778 to the 250 territory * concentrated overlays covering part of the 250 territory Ultimately, the CRTC concluded that there was not enough time to implement a split before 250 was due to exhaust. Additionally, the major telecom providers in the 250 territory contended that an overlay would be far easier to implement than a split. Telus and other carriers wanted to spare their Vancouver Island customers the expense and burden of changing their numbers for the second time in a decade.Telecom Decision 2007-38 Accordingly, the CRTC announced on June 7, 2007, that 778 would become an overlay for the entire province effective July 4, 2007.New dialing to come in British Columbia Overlays have become the preferred method of relief in Canada, as they are an easy workaround for the number allocation problem; no area codes have been split in the country since 1999. As of June 23, 2008, ten-digit dialling became mandatory across British Columbia; attempting to use seven digits would trigger an intercept message reminding callers of the new rule. After September 12, 2008, seven-digit dialling ceased to function.Ten-digit dialing coming to all of B.C. This was intended as a long-term solution, but within four years 604, 250 and 778 were close to exhaustion once again.

It consists largely of close-knit terraces, the majority of which date from the first two decades of the 20th century. In the early 1960s, a large number of very small terraced houses were demolished to make way for flats and maisonettes which were built between Garden Street, Penleys Grove/Townend Street and Lowther Street; this area has a residents' association. The Groves area contains a mixture of privately owned and rented properties, and council housing, and contains a number of students from York St John University. Lowther Street is the main area for local shopping, with an Indian restaurant and takeaway, Chinese takeaway, a small supermarket and a shop specialising in Polish food. In Penleys Grove Street there is a grocery shop. Lowther Street has historically been a busy route for traffic during rush hour, however in 2020 traffic has been re-routed away from Lowther Street through an 18 month experimental low traffic trial run by York Council based on feedback from residents of the Groves who desire \\"better air quality,\\" \\"less and slower traffic\\" and \\"the chance to build on the existing sense of community.\\" The Groves includes Park Grove Primary School, the Young Groves centre, Door 84, and St Thomas' Church.

Jail is the seventh album by American comedian Richard Pryor, allegedly recorded live at P.J.'s in West Hollywood, California. Album's release and Pryor’s authorization Although this album was not released until 1976 it was probably made during Pryor’s \\"transitional period\\"—i.e. after he walked off the stage at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas but before he recorded the 1974 LP, That Nigger's Crazy. This is suggested both by the tone and content of the material as well as by the information available about this recording in the Goldmine Comedy Record Price Guide. Sonically this album is uniformly consistent. There are no significant changes in the character of Pryor’s voice, the level of the volume, or the general sounds of the audience. On several different tracks there are problems with noises and distortion from the microphone which are all acoustically similar to each other. All of this suggests that the master tapes for this album were recorded during one set of performances with the same recording set up, the same engineer, and the same troublesome microphone. It is not, like some of Pryor’s unauthorized albums on Laff Records, made up of sonically inconsistent tracks obviously recorded at different performances and different points during his career. Two of the tracks on this album are taken from one of Pryor’s previously released albums. Tracks #1 and #7, \\"Arrested\\" and \\"Black Jack,\\" on this album are the same as Tracks #8 and #14, \\"Cops/Line Up\\" and \\"Black Jack,\\" on the Craps (After Hours) album. Since Craps is known to have been recorded at The Redd Foxx Club in Hollywood this calls into question the assertion of this album’s own notes which state that it was recorded at P.J.’s in Los Angeles. Many of these tracks appear later on the 2005 compilation album Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974) which does include detailed notes. According to the notes on Evolution/Revolution, the tracks on this album which also appear on Craps were recorded at The Redd Foxx Club in January 1971. Those notes from Evolution/Revolution, however, do not include any information concerning the dates or venues for the other tracks which appear on both Evolution/Revolution and L.A. Jail. The usually reliable Goldmine Comedy Record Price Guide also claims that Pryor authorized the release of this album on Tiger Lily Records. As most sources such as Robert Plante claim, however, the releases on Tiger Lily were usually unauthorized--Tiger Lily being, in fact, a tax scam operated by Morris Levy, the Mafia connected head of Roulette Records. The fact that several of these tracks are copies of tracks which appeared on an album that Pryor had previously released also supports the notion that this album was not authorized. Connections to Evolution/Revolution As stated earlier, in 2005, many of these tracks appeared on Pryor’s compilation album Evolution/Revolution. They are: S1,T1 – \\"Arrested\\" – which appears on E/R as #30 – \\"The Line Up\\" S1,T6 – \\"Bathrooms\\" – which appears on E/R as #16 – \\"Movie Stars In The Bathroom\\" S2,T1 – \\"Black Jack\\" – which appears on E/R as #36 – \\"Blackjack\\" S2,T2 \\"Groovy Feelings\\" – which appears on E/R as #12 – \\"I Feel\\" S2,T4 \\"Chow Line\\" – which appears on E/R as #13 – \\"Jail\\" Connection to other Pryor material Several of these tracks can also be connected with material Pryor will use on other albums. \\"Farting Smells\\" includes material that is very similar to the tracks \\"Fartin’\\" from Craps (After Hours) and \\"Farting\\" from Richard Pryor. \\"Funky People\\" is incredibly similar to \\"Smells\\" from Richard Pryor. \\"2001\\" is an almost verbatim recreation of a scene from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey which Pryor will again recreate at the end of the track \\"Acid\\" from Bicentennial Nigger. This track may also help date this recording since Pryor claims that his reason for recreating this scene was because he had just seen the movie and he couldn’t stop thinking about it. Assuming he saw the film during its original release, that would date this performance to the spring or summer of 1968.

It is a competitive game that involves kicking a ball through an opening into a net. The use of hands is not allowed. Invented in the Han dynasty, it is recognized by FIFA as the earliest form of football for which there is evidence, being first mentioned as an exercise in a Chinese military work from the 3rd–2nd century BC. It was also played in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. History One Hundred Children in the Long Spring (長春百子圖), a painting by Chinese artist Su Hanchen (蘇漢臣, active AD 1130–1160s), Song Dynasty The first mention of cuju in a historical text is in the Warring States era Zhan Guo Ce, in the section describing the state of Qi. It is also described in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian (under Su Qin's biography), written during the Han Dynasty.Riordan (1999), 32. A competitive form of cuju was used as fitness training for military cavaliers, while other forms were played for entertainment in wealthy cities like Linzi. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), the popularity of cuju spread from the army to the royal courts and upper classes. It is said that the Han emperor Wu Di enjoyed the sport. At the same time, cuju games were standardized and rules were established. Cuju matches were often held inside the imperial palace. A type of court called ju chang was built especially for cuju matches, which had six crescent-shaped goal posts at each end. The sport was improved during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). First of all, the feather-stuffed ball was replaced by an air-filled ball with a two-layered hull. Also, two different types of goal posts emerged: One was made by setting up posts with a net between them and the other consisted of just one goal post in the middle of the field. The Tang Dynasty capital of Chang'an was filled with cuju fields, in the backyards of large mansions, and some were even established in the grounds of the palaces.Benn, 172. Soldiers who belonged to the imperial army and Gold Bird Guard often formed cuju teams for the delight of the emperor and his court. The level of female cuju teams also improved. Records indicate that once a 17-year-old girl beat a team of army soldiers. Cuju even became popular amongst the scholars and intellectuals, and if a courtier lacked skill in the game, he could pardon himself by acting as a scorekeeper. Cuju flourished during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) due to social and economic development, extending its popularity to every class in society. At that time, professional cuju players were popular, and the sport began to take on a commercial edge. Professional cuju players fell into two groups: One was trained by and performed for the royal court (unearthed copper mirrors and brush pots from the Song often depict professional performances) and the other consisted of civilians who made a living as cuju players. During this period only one goal post was set up in the center of the field. File:Bronze mirror depicting kickball.jpgBronze mirror dating to the Song Dynasty.

Gameplay Historically, there were two main styles of cuju: zhuqiu () and baida (). Zhuqiu was commonly performed at court feasts celebrating the emperor's birthday or during diplomatic events. A competitive cuju match of this type normally consisted of two teams with 12–16 players on each side. Baida became dominant during the Song Dynasty, a style that attached much importance to developing personal skills. Scoring goals became obsolete when using this method with the playing field enclosed using thread and players taking turns to kick the ball within these set limits. The number of fouls made by the players decided the winner. For example, if the ball was not passed far enough to reach other team members, points were deducted. If the ball was kicked too far out, a large deduction from the score would result. Kicking the ball too low or turning at the wrong moment all led to fewer points. Players could touch the ball with any part of the body except their hands, whilst the number of players ranged anywhere from two to ten. In the end, the player with the highest score won. Cuju began to decline during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) due to neglect, and the 2,000-year-old sport slowly faded away. Cuju clubs In the 10th century, a cuju league, Qi Yun She (齊雲社) (or Yuan She), was developed in large Chinese cities. Local members were either cuju lovers or professional performers. Non-professional players had to formally appoint a professional as their teacher and pay a fee before becoming members. This process ensured an income for the professionals, unlike cuju of the Tang Dynasty. Qi Yun She organised annual national championships known as Shan Yue Zheng Sai (山岳正賽). In popular culture * The Hong Kong TVB series A Change of Destiny featured at least one episode based on the cuju competition. Bagua concepts were also used to jinx the opposing team. However, it followed more of the modern football rules than the ancient rules of the game. * John Woo's epic film Red Cliff features a cuju competition with Cao Cao and others observing from the sideline.

They were developed in 1988 by Chen, under the Kuomintang administration of Lee Teng-hui. They indicate events which, if occurred, would cause the DPP to immediately advocate for independence for Taiwan. They are: *If the Kuomintang unilaterally holds talks with the Chinese Communists; *If the Kuomintang sold out the interests of the people of Taiwan; *If the Chinese communists annexed Taiwan; *If the Kuomintang did not implement true constitutional democracy. Effect on Taiwan independence movement As the second largest political party in Taiwan, the DPP is the most prominent pro-independence force on the island (the Kuomintang's position is historically that of Chinese reunification under a republican government, though it has become ambivalent). As an illegal opposition party in its early years, DPP's push for Taiwan independence was a main focus of its contrast to the ruling party; since its legitimacy and coming to power as an established party, it has tempered its push for independence. Former president Lee and estranged politician James Soong and their followers broke ranks with the Kuomintang shortly after the coming to power of the DPP, having positioned themselves as supporters of Taiwan independence.

Instead of pressing the weight up slowly, in proper form, a spotter generally aids in the concentric, or lifting, portion of the repetition while the lifter slowly performs the eccentric phase for 3–6 seconds. Negative reps are used to improve both muscular strength and power in subjects, this is commonly known as hypertrophy training. Due to its mechanical properties, this form of training can be used for both healthy individuals and individuals who are in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that negative repetitions or \\"eccentric phase training\\" combines a high amount of force on the muscle with a lower energy cost than normal concentric training, which requires 4–5 times the amount of energy. This justifies why this type of training is more beneficial and less of a risk to subjects rehabilitating or with a limited exercise capacity.  History  Eccentric training is often associated with the terms \\"muscles soreness\\" and \\"muscle damage\\". In 1902, Theodore Hough discovered and developed the term DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), after he found that exercises containing negative repetitions caused athletes to have sore muscles. Hough believed this was causing a rupture within the muscle; when he looked further into the subject, he found that when performing eccentric exercise that exhibited soreness, the muscle \\"quickly adapts and becomes accustomed to the increase in applied stress\\". The result of this was that the muscles' soreness not only decreased, but the muscular damage did too.  Health benefits for the elderly  It has been proven that eccentric resistance training improves the functional mobility of older adults. Studies have shown that eccentric training of the lower body, in particular the knee extensors, are essential in preventing falls in older adults and helping them maintain their independence. A study conducted focusing on eccentric training for the age group 65–87 years of age showed that, over 12 weeks, they had strengthened their knee extensors by up to 26%. With this evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that negative repetitions can help improve the health of older adults.  Treatment of Tendinopathy  Studies have shown that eccentric training may be successful in the treatment of certain tendonitis. Studies have shown that the use of eccentric training for twelve weeks may be an alternative to therapy for people suffering from Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee). Eccentric training has also been proven successful in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendonitis, using a twelve-week eccentric calf muscle program various studies have shown the ability for people to return to normal pre-tendonitis levels. The reasoning behind the benefits of eccentric training for tendinopathy is still unclear.

According to the Kodansha Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japan, ubasute \\"is the subject of legend, but… does not seem ever to have been a common custom\\".. Folklore Ubasute has left its mark on Japanese folklore, where it forms the basis of many legends, poems, and koans. In one Buddhist allegory, a son carries his mother up a mountain on his back. During the journey, she stretches out her arms, catching the twigs and scattering them in their wake, so that her son will be able to find the way home. A poem commemorates the story: In popular culture * The practice is discussed in some detail in Radiolab episode #305 Mortality. Ubasute sometimes appears as a metaphor for contemporary Japan's treatment of the elderly, who are noted for above-average suicide rates.Suicide 'epidemic' among Japan's elderly BBC News * The practice of ubasute is explored at length in the Japanese novel The Ballad of Narayama (1956) by Shichirō Fukazawa. The novel was the basis for three films: Keisuke Kinoshita's The Ballad of Narayama (1958), Korean director Kim Ki-young's Goryeojang (1963), and Shohei Imamura's The Ballad of Narayama, which won the Palme d'Or in 1983. * The Old Law, a 17th-century tragicomedy written by Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and Philip Massinger and Anthony Trollope's 1882 dystopian novel, The Fixed Period also explore the concept of 'Ubasute' in a Western context. * The characters of Christopher Buckley's 2007 novel Boomsday introduce the concept of 'Ubasute' as a political ploy to stave off the insolvency of social security as more and more of the aging US population reaches retirement age, angering the Religious Right and Baby Boomers. * The concept of 'Ubasute' forms the basis of the storyline for the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Half a Life\\". * The musical Pacific Overtures contains a reference to Ubasute. During the song 'Four Black Dragons', as a city is being evacuated for fear of an American naval force, a panicked merchant is willing to abandon his aged mother during the evacuation, but the merchant is reminded that his son could do the same when the merchant is just as old. The merchant reluctantly picks up his mother and carries her on his back. * Episode 19 of Folktales from Japan depicts this tale. * The Decemberists song \\"I Don't Mind\\" has a depiction of ubasute – \\"So here's you with your mom on your back, going into the woods...\\" Places Ubasute Mountain Ubasute Mountain * is the common name of , a mountain () in Chikuma, Nagano, Japan.冠着山 長野県の山 信州山学ガイド] Hoffman * Obasute Station, Chikuma, Nagano Prefecture, Japan * According to folklore, the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji was once one of such sites, where its reputation as a suicide site might have originated.

Early life and career  Osborne was the eldest son of Sidney Francis Godolphin Osborne and of Margaret Dulcibella, née Hammersley. Through his father, he was the great-great-grandson of Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, Foreign Secretary between 1783 and 1791. He was educated at Haileybury College, before joining HM Diplomatic Service. In about 1919 or 1920, Osborne met Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the future Queen Elizabeth, with whom he maintained a life-long friendship and correspondence. He later described her as \\"the past love of his life\\". Osborne was posted to Portugal (Counsellor, 1928–1929) and Italy (Counsellor, 1929–1931). He then served as British Minister at Washington, the deputy head of the British mission to the United States. from 1931 to 1935. Minister to the Holy See Osborne was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Holy See 1936–1947.The London Gazette, 22 May 1936 His appointment came on the heels of Cardinal Secretary of State Pacelli's (future Pope Pius XII) complaints of the short tenure of British Ministers to the Vatican; in fact, Osborne himself waited six months after his appointment before arriving in Rome.Chadwick, 1988, p. 3. When Italy declared war on the United Kingdom in 1940, Osborne, accredited to the Holy See but living in Italian territory, moved inside the Vatican according to arrangements made under the Lateran Treaty. With a few exceptions, Osborne would be immured inside the Vatican until the liberation of Rome in 1944, working under difficult conditions. Using the code name \\"Mount\\", he was one of the group, which he supported with his own money, led by Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty and a French diplomat François de Vial who helped conceal some 4,000 escapees, whether Jews or Allied soldiers, from the Nazis: 3,925 survived the war. Their story was portrayed in the 1983 film The Scarlet and the Black, starring Gregory Peck. He also played a key part in a plot in 1940, which involved the Pope and certain German generals, to overthrow Hitler.Owen Chadwick's Britain and the Vatican During the Second World War, (1988, Cambridge University Paperback Library), p. 86 et seq. Major Sam Derry, in his book The Rome Escape Line, described meeting Sir D'Arcy in the Vatican in 1943: > Unruffled poise... Seldom have I met any man in whom I had such immediate > confidence. He welcomed us warmly, yet I found it impossible to behave with > anything but strict formality. Apart from the restraining influence of my > clothing [he was disguised as a monsignor] I was almost overwhelmed by an > atmosphere of old-world English courtliness and grace which I had thought > belonged only to the country-house parties of long ago. Sir D'Arcy was spry, > trim, a young sixty, but he had spent years enough in the diplomatic service > to develop an astonishing aptitude for creating around himself an aura of > all that was most civilized in English life. I felt as though I had returned > home after long travels, to find that royalty had come to dinner, and I had > to be on my best behaviour.Sam Derry (1960), The Rome Escape Line, New York: > Norton, (accessed 1 November 2017), p. 43. Following this dinner Sir D'Arcy offered Derry the command of the escape organisation.Tony Narroway, \\"Samuel Ironmonger Derry: Freemason and master escapee\\", Freemasonry Today website, 6 March 2015, accessed 1 November 2017. Post-war Protestant Cemetery, Rome, grave of the 12th Duke of Leeds After the war, Osborne retired from the Diplomatic Service and settled in Italy, living at the Palazzo Sacchetti, 66 Via Giulia, Rome. With the future Pope Paul VI, whom he had befriended during the war, he co-founded an industrial school for the poor boys of Rome. He was visited by The Queen and The Queen Mother on several occasions. His financial situation remained precarious, and in 1962 a group of friends, including The Queen Mother, arranged a sum of money for his relief. Osborne succeeded his second cousin once removed as the Duke of Leeds on 26 July 1963. He died just a year later on 20 March 1964, at the age of seventy-nine, at which point the dukedom and all of its subsidiary titles became extinct.John Julius Norwich, A Christmas Cracker 2017, n.p., n.d., , p. [2]. Pope Paul VI, who had sent his personal chamberlain to visit Osborne's residence daily during his final illness, expressed his condolences, as did Cardinal Cicognani, the papal Secretary of State. The Duke of Leeds was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome on 24 March 1964. Sir Peter Scarlett, British Minister to the Holy See, represented the Queen at the funeral, and the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir John Ward, represented the Queen Mother.  Honours  Osborne was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1930, and promoted to Knight Commander (KCMG) in the 1943 Birthday Honours, receiving the knighthood on his only trip to the United Kingdom during the Second World War, which required special Italian permission. He was also a Knight of Grace of the Order of Saint John (KStJ) and Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KCSG). Legacy Osborne kept an extensive diary, portions of which were used by Owen Chadwick as the basis of his 1980 Ford Lectures and his 1988 book, Britain and the Vatican during the Second World War. Chadwick's quotations from Osborne's diary included: \\"I reached the grave conclusion during the Mass that I am nothing but a pencilled marginal note in the Book of Life. I am not in the main text at all.\\"Owen Chadwick, Britain and the Vatican during the Second World War, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 128. Accessed 1 November 2017.

It was released on the Blue Rock label (4014) in May 1965 with \\"Sir Mack Rice\\" as the artist.Singles reviews Spotlights. Billboard Mar 27, 1965 page 65 The song uses an AAB layout with a 24-bar structure. It gained greater popularity when Wilson Pickett covered it the following year on a single, a version that was also released on the 1966 album, The Wicked Pickett. Also in 1966, John Lee Hooker recorded an entirely different song with a similar title — \\"Mustang Sally & GTO\\". History Rice was visiting singer Della Reese, who was considering buying a new Lincoln Continental for her drummer and band leader Calvin Shields for his birthday. Rice and other band members were teasing Shields about the pending gift, and Shields replied that he did not want a Lincoln; he wanted a Ford Mustang. Rice had never heard of the Mustang, which had just come out, but he teased Shields about wanting a smaller car. He decided there might be a song in the situation, changing it to be about a woman who doesn't want to do anything but ride around in her new car. Rice called the early version \\"Mustang Mama\\", but changed the title after Aretha Franklin suggested \\"Mustang Sally\\" because he used the name Sally in the chorus. Rice got part of the chorus from the children's game song (recorded by various artists) \\"Little Sally Walker,\\" versions of which include the lyrics \\"Ride Sally ride, wipe your weepin' eyes\\", with variations. His variation goes, \\"All you wanna do is ride around, Sally/Ride, Sally, ride/One of these early mornings/You're gonna be wipin' your weepin' eyes.\\" In the liner notes for The Rascals Anthology, Felix Cavaliere states that The Young Rascals recorded \\"Mustang Sally\\" and \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\" before Pickett and that Atlantic Records \\"copped those two songs from them and gave them to Pickett\\" to record. When Cavaliere does his flashback concerts, he also recounts how Rice thanked him for having been the B-side of the Young Rascals' hit, \\"Good Lovin'\\", explaining that the royalties were paid by records sold — thus, the B-side writer was paid for an equal number of sales as the A-side. Popular versions Rice's version made it to #15 on the U.S. R&B; charts in 1965. Pickett's version climbed to #6 on the R&B; charts and #23 on the Pop charts in 1966, #4 in Canada on the (RPM) charts, and #28Wilson Pickett - \\"Mustang Sally\\" at UK Singles Chart Stats.

It stars Jun Ji-hyun, Jang Hyuk, and was directed by Kwak Jae-yong. The film held its premiere in Hong Kong, attended by Jang and Jun, on 28 May 2004, being the first Korean film to do so. It was released on June 3, 2004 by CJ Entertainment and ran at 123 minutes. Plot The film stars Jun Ji-hyun as Officer Yeo Kyung-jin, an ambitious young female police officer serving on the Seoul police department. One day while chasing a purse snatcher, she accidentally captures Go Myung-woo (played by Jang Hyuk), a physics teacher at an all-girls school, who was actually trying to catch the thief. Later, Myung-woo discovers the stolen purse, but just as he picks it up, Kyung-jin spots him and tries to arrest him again. Kyung-jin is then given the job of escorting Myung-woo through a dangerous district, only to be distracted when she tries to break up a meeting between Russian Mafia and Korean gangsters. With Myung-woo handcuffed to her, Kyung-jin almost single- handedly brings down the two rival gangs (although she is helped when she accidentally causes the groups to start shooting at each other). The first half of the film, told from Myung-woo's point of view, details the couple's growing attraction and love for each other, which climaxes with a trip to the countryside where Myung-woo tells Kyung-jin that if he were ever to die, he wanted to come back to earth as the wind. Soon after, he is almost killed in a freak automobile accident, but Kyung-jin saves his life. The film takes a turn into the fantasy genre in its second half after Myung-woo is accidentally shot and killed by another officer (although the situation is such that Kyung-jin thinks that it was her shot that killed him) as Kyung-jin chases after a criminal. Kyung-jin falls into a suicidal depression over his death and attempts to kill herself several times, almost succeeding when she throws herself off a building, only to be saved when a giant balloon floats under her. Soon after, she experiences visitations from Myung-woo, who appears as the wind, sending her messages and, at one point, he even appears in her dreams in order to give her the will to live after she is nearly shot to death by a criminal. Ultimately the film follows a similar path set out by the American film Ghost with Myung-woo and Kyung-jin communicating and sharing one final gesture of love before he moves on to the afterlife. Myung-woo said that he will whisper, when she hears him whisper in the wind, she will meet someone with a soul like him. Myung-woo told Kyung-jin that he will always be beside her inside a book with a photo left by Myung-woo in the restaurant before he rushed to meet Kyung-jin who was chasing the insane criminal. In the first half of the film, Myung-woo told that his only memory of high school was his high school trip. The book and the photo is found and returned to Kyung-jin in the police station. The photo showed that on Myung-woo's trip, Kyung-jin was nearby. This proved Myung-woo's \\"I'm always beside you\\" was true to Kyung-jin. Kyung-jin rushed out to locate the finder of the book, ultimately ending up in the train station, where she is saved by Cha Tae-hyun's character (credited as The Guy). Myung-woo whispered that The Guy is the one with the soul like him. Kyung-jin whispers that \\"he is always beside her.\\" Cast * Jun Ji-hyun as Officer Yeo Kyung-jin * Jang Hyuk as Go Myung-woo * Kim Jung-tae as Kim Young- ho * Kim Su-ro as hostage taker * Lee Ki-woo as Prince * Im Ye-jin as female cop of police substation * Kim Chang-wan as chief of police substation * Jung Ho-bin as criminal Shin Chang-soo * Jung Dae-hoon as runaway boy 1 * Jeon Jae- hyung as runaway boy 2 * Oh Jung-se as police corporal Jo / prince * Jeon Sung-ae as police deputy * Kim So-yeon as female student * Woo Ki-hong as gangster * Son Young-soon as old woman * Kim Kwang-kyu as undercover cop / prince 3 * Lee Sang-hoon as Detective Min * Seo Dong-won as Moon-ho * Kim Jin- soo as high school student * Min Young as hostage * Lee Jung-hoon as doctor * Kim Jong-min * Cha Tae-hyun as man on train platform (cameo) Connections to My Sassy Girl Windstruck shares the same leading actress and director as an earlier popular South Korean film, My Sassy Girl. As a result, Windstruck contains several subtle references to the previous film. It is also worth noting that throughout both movies Jun Ji-hyun's characters have an overall cheerful and sassy personality but soon revealing sadness and emotion. Jun Ji- hyun also plays the piano in both movies, where a photo of Jun Ji-hyun from My Sassy Girl is visible on Kyung-jin's piano. When Kyung-jin is chasing Sin Chang-su she tells a random citizen to act as a steppingstone to climb over the wall, just like when she accidentally steps on a runaway soldier (played by the same actor) when she and Tae-hyun visited the amusement park during her birthday. In the start of My Sassy Girl she is distraught over a boyfriend that died (though the reason was never disclosed) before meeting Cha Tae-hyun, and in Windstruck her boyfriend (Myung-woo) died due to hunting Sin Chang-su. The explains why the final scene of Windstruck in which Kyung-jin is saved by new soul mate (played by Cha Tae-hyun, the male lead from My Sassy Girl) on a train platform, is very similar to the beginning of My Sassy Girl, essentially setting up Windstruck as a spiritual prequel to My Sassy Girl.

He learned taxidermy and specimen preparation from his uncle, an Abbot. He went in a high school in Udine and studied medicine in Padua, where he reorganized the zoological collections. In 1832 he reorganized the invertebrate collection at the Imperial Natural History Museum in Vienna and in 1840 he became Fellow of the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, an academy whose aim is “to increase, promulgate, and safeguard the sciences, literature and the arts”. Nardo wrote hundreds of scientific publications ranging from medicine and social sciences, philology, technology, physics, but mostly on Venetian and Adriatic zoology. In marine biology, Nardo wrote on algae, marine invertebrates, fishes and sea turtles. A vast collection of his manuscripts and his personal library is preserved in the Natural History Museum of Venice. According to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), Nardo is the naming authority for 144 marine taxa.

Bekobod received city status in 1945. Until 1964, the city was known as Begovat.  Geography  Bekabad lies along both banks of the Syr Darya River near Uzbekistan's border with Tajikistan. There are mountains to the northeast and southeast of the city. By road it is south of Tashkent.  Climate  Bekabad has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa) with continental influences. It has cold winters and hot summers. The average June–July temperature is . Sometimes the average June–July temperature reaches . The mean temperature in January is .  Demographics  In 2009, Bekabad had a population of 101,292. Representatives of many ethnic groups can be found in the city. Uzbeks are the largest ethnic group.  Economy  Bekabad remains an important industrial city in independent Uzbekistan. It is home to a large steel mill and a cement factory. There is also a brick factory, a meat-packing plant, a cotton plant, and many small and medium enterprises. The Farkhad Dam and Farkhad Hydroelectric Plant lie just upstream from the city.  Education  Bekabad is home to a medical institute and a vocational school. There are also 17 secondary schools, two music schools, and one sports school in the city.

Due to the defect in the respiratory chain, 'petite' yeast are unable to grow on media containing only non-fermentable carbon sources (such as glycerol or ethanol) and form small colonies when grown in the presence of fermentable carbon sources (such as glucose). The petite phenotype can be caused by the absence of, or mutations in, mitochondrial DNA (termed \\"cytoplasmic Petites\\"), or by mutations in nuclear-encoded genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. A neutral petite produces all wild type progeny when crossed with wild type. petite mutations can be induced using a variety of mutagens, including DNA intercalating agents, as well as chemicals that can interfere with DNA synthesis in growing cells. Mutagens that create Petites are implicated in increased rates of degenerative diseases and in the aging process.  Overview  A mutation that produces small (petite\\" > petite) anaerobic-like colonies had shown first in Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and described by Boris Ephrussi and his co-workers in 1949 in Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The cells of petite colonies were smaller than those of wild-type colonies, but the term “petite” refers only to colony size and not the individual cell size.  History  Over 50 years ago, in a lab in France, Ephrussi, et al. discovered a non-Mendelian inherited factor that is essential to respiration in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae without this factor, known as the ρ-factor, is described by the development of small colonies when compared to the wild-type yeast. These smaller colonies were dubbed petite colonies. These petite mutants were observed to be spontaneously produced naturally at a rate of 0.1%-1.0% every generation. They also found that treatment of wild-type S. cerevisiae with DNA-intercalating agents would more rapidly produce this mutation. Schatz identified a region of the yeast’s nuclear DNA that was associated with the mitochondria in 1964. Later, it was discovered that mutants without the ρ-factor had no mitochondrial DNA (called ρ0 isolates), or that they possessed a difference in density or amount of the mitochondrial DNA (called ρ− isolates). The use of electron microscopy to view the DNA in the mitochondrial matrix helped to verify the actuality of the mitochondrial genome. S. cerevisiae has since become a useful model for aging. It has been shown that as yeast ages, it loses functional mitochondrial DNA, which leads to replicative senescence, or the inability to further replicate. It has been suggested that there is a link between mitochondrial DNA loss and replicative life span (RLS), or the number of times a cell can reproduce before it dies, as it has been found that an increase in RLS is established with the same changes in the genome that enhance the propagation of cells that do not contain mitochondrial DNA. Genetic screens for replicative life span associated genes and pathways could be made easier and quicker by selecting genetic suppressors of the petite negative mutants.  Causes  The petite is characterized by a deficiency in cytochromes (a, a3 + b) and a lack of respiratory enzymes which engage in respiration in mitochondria. Due to the error in the respiratory chain pathway, 'petite' yeast is incapable of growing on media containing only non-fermentable carbon sources (such as glycerol or ethanol) and forming small colonies when grown in the presence of fermentable carbon sources (such as glucose). The absence of mitochondria can cause the petite phenotype, or by deletion mutations in mitochondrial DNA (termed \\"cytoplasmic Petites\\") which is a deletion mutation, or by mutations in nuclear-encoded genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation.  Experiment  Petite mutants can be generated in the laboratory by using high-efficiency treatments such as acriflavine, ethidium bromide, and other intercalating agents. Their mechanisms work to break down and cause the eventual loss of mitochondrial DNA: if the treatment time increases, the amount of mitochondrial DNA will decrease. After prolonged treatment, petites containing no detectable mitochondrial DNA were obtained. It is useful approach to illustrate the function of mitochondrial DNA in yeast growth.  Petite mutation inheritance  The inheritance pattern of genes existing in the cell organelles such as mitochondria which named cytoplasmic inheritance differs from nuclear genes pattern. Petite mutants show extranuclear inheritance.The inheritance pattern varying with the type of petite involved.  Petite mutation inheritance types  Petite mutants show extranuclear inheritance.The inheritance pattern varying with the type of petite involved. Segregational petites (pet–): mutants are created by nuclear mutations and exhibit Mendelian 1:1 segregation. Neutral petites (rho–N): Neutral petite when crossed to wild-type, all offspring are wild-type. It has inherited normal mitochondrial DNA from wild-type parent, which is replicated in the offspring. Suppressive petites (rho–S): crosses between petite and wild-type, all offspring are petite, showing \\"dominant\\" behavior to suppress wild-type mitochondrial function. Most petite mutants of S. cerevisiae are of a suppressive type, and they differ from neutral petite by affecting the wild- type, although both are a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial genome of yeast will be the first eukaryotic genome to be understood in terms of both structure and function and this should smooth the way to understand the evolution of organelle genomes and its relationship with nuclear genomes.It is evident that Ephrussi’s work not only opened the field of extrachromosomal genetics, but also provide a fantastic incentive for the investigations which followed up to this day. Though S. cerevisiae has been extensively studied in this and other areas, it is difficult to say if the molecular mechanisms of this process in the mitochondrial DNA are conserved across other yeast species. Other yeast species, such as Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces castellii, and Candida albicans have all shown to produce petite negative mutants. Potentially, these yeasts have a different inheritance system in place for their mitochondrial genome than S. cerevisiae does. The frequency at which S. castellii spontaneously produces petites is similar to that of S. cerevisiae, with the mitochondrial DNA of those petites being highly altered via deletion and rearrangement. Suppressive petites of S. cerevisiae are the most commonly observed spontaneously created mutants, whereas in S. castellii, the most commonly observed spontaneous mutant is the neutral petite, further leading to speculation that the transference of this mutation differs between species.

Founded in 1839, it is the city's oldest cultural institution. Its building on Collins Street in the East End Theatre District sits opposite the Regent Theatre, and currently consists of a main theatre, a smaller studio theatre, a restaurant and a subscription library. It has also served as a mechanics' institute, an art exhibition space, and a cinema. The building was added to the National Trust's Register of Historic Buildings in 1981 and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. History=Early history The first President was Captain William Lonsdale, the first Patron was the Superintendent of Port Phillip, Charles La Trobe and the first books were donated by Vice-President Henry Fyshe Gisborne. Originally called the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute, it was renamed in 1846 to the Melbourne Mechanics' Institution and School of Arts. The building at 188 Collins Street was completed in 1842. The Melbourne City Council met in the building until 1852 when the Melbourne Town Hall was built. The Institution changed its name to the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1872. At that time, as now, a focal point was the library. In 1877, membership was 1,681 and in 1879 there were 30,000 visits to the library. In 1880 it was reported 'that the floor of the large hall was the only one in Melbourne expressly constructed for dancing'. The front of the building was rebuilt in 1885 and 1886. Theatre and cinema In October 1896, the first movie was shown in Australia in the Athenaeum Hall. The Hall became a regular venue for screening films and the premiere of The Story of the Kelly Gang by the Tait brothers, the world's first dramatic feature film, was at the Athenaeum in 1906. The theatre in its present form, a proscenium arch theatre with 880 seats on three levels, was created in 1924, designed by Henry Eli White. It was the first venue in Australia to screen talking pictures, presenting The Jazz Singer in February 1929. From the 1920s to the early 1970s, the theatre was mainly used as a cinema. The Melbourne Theatre Company (MTC) leased the theatre from 1976 to 1985 when the lease was taken over by various entrepreneurs who formed AT Management in 1997. The upstairs studio theatre (\\"Ath 2\\"), created from the former art gallery by the MTC, has been used as a theatre space and the venue for The Last Laugh Comedy Club after it moved from North Melbourne. Art gallery The Athenaeum housed a small museum in its early days and then an art gallery. The gallery hosted the first exhibition of Frederick McCubbin's The Pioneer in 1904, and in 1918, the Australian tonalists staged their first group exhibition there. 'Jock' Frater held his first solo show there in 1923, marking his break from the Tonalists. The gallery also showed paintings by Rupert Bunny, Hans Heysen, Albert Namatjira, Tom Roberts, John Rowell, Ernest Buckmaster, Constance Stokes and Arthur Streeton, before closing in 1971. The gallery also hosted talks by the Melbourne Society of Women Painters, including one in 1935 at which Mary Cecil Allen spoke. Subscription library Membership of the Athenaeum's subscription library peaked at 7,579 in 1950, after the State Library of Victoria ceased lending of its books in 1939. Membership reduced over the subsequent decades to 1,600 by the mid-1980s, and 750 by the late 2000s. Membership is now increasing. Today Today, the Athenaeum Theatre is used for theatre, comedy and music performances, including as a principal venue for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and Melbourne Opera. The Wheeler Centre for Books, Writing and Ideas presents discussions and talks at the theatre. The Hillsong Church also uses the theatre for its Sunday services. The subscription library has a 30,000-strong collection and hosts regular events, talks, book clubs and a screen club.

The organisation has 2,500 employees at some 30 locations, generating annual sales of around €661 million. Its services include renting exhibition grounds, trade fair construction and marketing, personnel and food services. Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, the company is owned by the City of Frankfurt (60 percent) and the State of Hesse (40 percent). The Board of Management of Messe Frankfurt consists of Wolfgang Marzin (Chairman), Detlef Braun, and Uwe Behm. Frankfurt has been known for its trade fairs for over 800 years. In the Middle Ages, merchants and businessmen met at the \\"Römer\\", a medieval building in the heart of the city that served as a market place; from 1909 onwards, they met on the grounds of the Festhalle Frankfurt, to the north of Frankfurt Central Station. The first Frankfurt trade fair to be documented in writing dates back to 11 July 1240, when the Frankfurt Autumn Trade Fair was called into being by Emperor Frederick II, who decreed that merchants travelling to the fair were under his protection. Some ninety years later, on 25 April 1330, the Frankfurt Spring Fair also received its privilege from Emperor Louis IV. And from this time onwards, trade fairs were held in Frankfurt twice a year, in spring and autumn, forming the basic structure for Messe Frankfurt's modern consumer goods fairs.  Frankfurt Trade Fair = Location and size  Located at the heart of financial and business centre Frankfurt, the exhibition grounds are among the largest and most modern worldwide with of hall area and more than of free space at its disposal. As well as excellent international transport connections by air, rail and road, the exhibition venue enjoys excellent public transport connections: The S-Bahn suburban train station \\"Messe\\" stops in the centre of the exhibition grounds, the U-Bahn underground train station and the Strassenbahn tram station are located directly at the City Entrance/Festhalle.  Architecture  With their unique designs, architects such as Helmut Jahn, Oswald M. Ungers and Nicolas Grimshaw gave Messe Frankfurt's exhibition grounds an unmistakable look that dovetails with Frankfurt's modern cityscape. With the Congress Center and Kap Europa, the company operates two congress centres as well.

It deals primarily with the reign of Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, covers the conquest of Babylon by the Persian king Cyrus the Great, and ends with the start of the reign of Cyrus's son Cambyses, spanning a period from 556 BC to some time after 539 BC. It provides a rare contemporary account of Cyrus's rise to power and is the main source of information on this period;Oppenheim, A.L. \\"The Babylonian Evidence of Achaemenian Rule in Mesopotamia\\". In Gershevitch, Ilya (ed), The Cambridge History of Iran: Vol. 2 : The Median and Achaemenian periods, p. 535. Cambridge University Press, 1993. Amélie Kuhrt describes it as \\"the most reliable and sober [ancient] account of the fall of Babylon.\\"Kuhrt, Amélie. \\"Babylonia from Cyrus to Xerxes\\", in The Cambridge Ancient History: Persia, Greece, and the Western Mediterranean, C. 525-479 B.C, pp. 112-138. Cambridge University Press, 1988. The chronicle is thought to have been copied by a scribe during the Seleucid period (4th-1st century BC) but the original text was probably written during the late 6th or early 5th century BC.Clyde E. Fant, Mitchell G. Reddish, Lost Treasures of the Bible: Understanding the Bible Through Archaeological Artifacts in World Museums, p. 228. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008. Similarities with the Nabonassar to Shamash-shum- ukin Chronicle, another of the Babylonian Chronicles, suggest that the same scribe may have been responsible for both chronicles. If so, it may date to the reign of Darius I of Persia (c. 549 BC–486 BC).  Description of the tablet  The Nabonidus Chronicle is preserved on a single clay tablet now kept at the British Museum in London. Like the other Babylonian Chronicles, it lists in an annalistic (year-by-year) fashion the key events of each year, such as the accession and deaths of kings, major military events, and notable religious occurrences. It follows a standard pattern of reporting only events of immediate relevance to Babylonia, making it of somewhat limited utility as a source for a wider history of the region. The tablet itself is fairly large, measuring 140 mm wide by 140 mm long, but is significantly damaged with its bottom and most of the left-hand side missing. The text was composed in two columns on each side, originally consisting of some 300-400 lines. What remains is extremely fragmentary; little more than 75 lines of text are still legible. The missing portions consist of most of the first and fourth columns, along with the bottom of the second and the top of the third. There appears to have been a colophon at the bottom of the tablet, but it too is largely missing.Grayson, Albert Kirk. Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, p. 21. J.J. Augustin, 1975 Although the writing is of a good standard, the copying was decidedly imperfect and the scribe made a number of errors that are visible in the text.Smith, Sidney. Babylonian Historical Texts Relating to the Capture and Downfall of Babylon, p. 98. Taylor & Francis, 1975 (reprint). The tablet was acquired by the British Museum in 1879 from the antiquities dealers Spartali & Co. Its original place of discovery is unknown, though it has been presumed that it came from the ruins of Babylon. It possibly represents part of an official collection of annals in the possession of the Achaemenid governors of Babylon.Prince, John Dyneley. A Critical Commentary on the Book of Daniel: Designed Especially for Students of the English Bible, p. 219. J. C. Hinrichs, 1899 The text, known at the time as \\"the Annals of Nabonidus\\", was first discussed in print by Sir Henry Rawlinson in the Athenaeum magazine of 14 February 1880, with the first English transliteration and translation being published two years later by Professor T. G. Pinches in the Transactions of the Society for Biblical Archaeology (1882). It has since been translated by a number of scholars, notably Sidney Smith, A. Leo Oppenheim,Oppenheim, A. Leo.Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament. Princeton, 1950. Albert Kirk Grayson, Jean-Jacques Glassner,Glassner, Jean-Jacques. Mesopotamian Chronicles. Society of Biblical Literature, 2004. and Amélie Kuhrt.Kuhrt, Amelie. The Persian Empire: A Corpus of Sources of the Achaemenid Period. London: Routledge, 2007.  The text  The text of the chronicle begins presumably with the accession of Nabonidus in 556 BC, though the start of the text is so poorly preserved that none of this portion is legible. It mentions campaigns by Nabonidus against a place named Hume and unnamed localities in \\"the West\\" (Arabia?). Cyrus's pillaging of Ecbatana, the capital of Astyages, is recorded in the sixth year of the reign of Nabonidus. The chronicle goes on to describe in several entries the self-imposed exile of Nabonidus in the Arabian oasis of Tema (mentioned as Teiman in Hebrew in the Dead Sea Scrolls fragment 4Q242 known as the Testimony of Nebonidus dated to 150 BC)In the book \\"Dead Sea Scrolls Today\\" Teiman TYMN mentioned in Dead Sea Scrolls' fragment 4Q242 known as the testimony of Nabonidu Jewish Literature of the Second Temple Period and the disruption that this caused to the Akitu (New Year) festival for a period of ten years. The king spent ten years in Arabia and left Babylonia administered by his son, Bel-shar-usur (Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament). The eighth year is purposefully left blank; apparently the scribe did not have any significant events to record for that year. Another campaign by Cyrus is recorded in the ninth year, possibly representing his attack on Lydia and capture of Sardis. Much of the rest of the text is fragmentary. A possible reference to fighting and Persia appears in what is presumably the entry for the sixteenth year. A long surviving section describes the events of Nabonidus's seventeenth and final year as king, when Cyrus invaded and conquered Babylonia. The celebration of the Akitu festival is recorded, indicating Nabonidus's return to Babylon. The chronicle provides no information on why Cyrus chose to invade Babylonia at that time but records that the gods of various cities \\"entered Babylon\\", apparently referring to an in-gathering of cultic statues in advance of the Persian invasion – perhaps a measure taken by Nabonidus to prevent the Persians capturing the divine idols. It provides a terse description of the Battle of Opis, in which the Persians decisively defeated Nabonidus's army, massacred the retreating Babylonians and took a great haul of loot. The Persian army went on to capture the cities of Sippar and Babylon itself without further conflict.Briant, Pierre. From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire, p. 41. Eisenbrauns, 2006. Cyrus is reported to have been received with joy by the city's inhabitants and appointed local governors. The gods that had previously been brought to Babylon were returned to their home cities on the orders of Cyrus. The legible portion of the text ends with a lengthy period of mourning for the lately deceased king's wife (presumably meaning the wife of Cyrus, as Nabonidus was no longer king by this timeBrosius, Maria. Women in Ancient Persia, 559-331 BC, pp. 26-27. Oxford University Press, 1998. ) and a mention of Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. Only a few scattered words are legible in the remainder of the tablet.Grayson, A.K. Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, pp. 21-22, 104-111. Eisenbrauns, 2000.  Analysis  The Nabonidus Chronicle appears to have been composed by the (Babylonian) priests of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon. It has been characterised as \\"a piece of propaganda at Cyrus's service\\" Wiesehöfer, Josef (trans. Azodi, Azizeh). Ancient Persia: From 550 BC to 650 AD, p. 49. I.B.Tauris, 2001. and as possibly \\"the result of the propaganda of the priesthood of Marduk to vilify Nabonidus\\".Bidmead, Julye. The Akitu Festival: Religious Continuity And Royal Legitimation In Mesopotamia, p. 132-137. Gorgias Press LLC, 2004. Julye Bidmead attributes the priests' hostility to Nabonidus's unsuccessful attempts to introduce the worship of the moon god Sîn. In particular, the chronicle repeatedly asserts that the Akitu festival could not be held because of Nabonidus's absence. This is dubious, as others could have participated in the celebration in Nabonidus's place. The chronicle is seen as part of a series of pro-Persian documents, including the Cyrus cylinder and Verse Account of Nabonidus, that attack Nabonidus for alleged religious infidelity and contrast his actions with those of Cyrus and Cambyses.. However Amélie Kuhrt describes it as \\"the most reliable and sober ancient account of the fall of Babylon.\\"Kuhrt, Amélie. \\"Babylonia from Cyrus to Xerxes\\", in The Cambridge Ancient History: Persia, Greece, and the Western Mediterranean, C. 525-479 B.C, pp. 112-138.

Since 1981 it has been part of the collection of the Tate Gallery in London. The painting is interpreted as symbolic of the turbulent relationship between the artist and his father, as an amateur painter and staunch Catholic. In the painting, Ernst replaces the classic image of the Virgin Mary holding the crucified body of Jesus (pietà) with his father as Mary and the artist himself as Jesus. The expressions on both faces are blank as though in a state of sleepwalking. In the background drawn on a wall is a man with a bandaged head ascending a flight of stairs. A profile on the work in the British newspaper The Guardian indicates the figure could represent either Sigmund Freud or the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who suffered a head wound during World War I. Pietà or Revolution by Night is an example of the early period of the surrealist movement. Its title reflects the revolutionary sentiments of the movement, and in particular of its founder, André Breton. This image is notable for its combination of heavily textured surfaces and sharp, hand-drawn outlines.

The rotor–stator interaction is a predominant part of the noise emission. Presented are an introduction to these interaction theories, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction. Noise emission of a rotor–stator mechanism A rotor wake induces on the downstream stator blades a fluctuating vane loading, which is directly linked to the noise emission. Consider a B blades rotor (at a rotation speed of \\\\Omega) and a V blades stator, in a unique rotor–stator configuration. The source frequencies are multiples of B \\\\Omega, that is to say mB \\\\Omega. For the moment there is no access to the source levels F_{m}. The noise frequencies are also mB \\\\Omega, not depending on the number of blades of the stator. Nevertheless, this number V has a predominant role in the noise levels (P_{m}) and directivity, as it will be discussed later. Example For an airplane air- conditioning ventilator, reasonable data are : B=13 and \\\\Omega = 12000 rnd/min The blade passing frequency is 2600 Hz, so it is only necessary to include the first two multiples (2600 Hz and 5200 Hz), because of the human ear high- sensibility limit. The frequencies m=1 and m=2 must be studied. Optimization of the number of blades As the source levels can't be easily modified, it is necessary to focus on the interaction between those levels and the noise levels . The transfer function {{P_m } \\\\over {F_m }} contains the following part : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{s = - \\\\infty }^{s = + \\\\infty } {e^{ - J_{mB - sV} } (mBM) Where M is the Mach number and J_{mB - sV} the Bessel function of mB–sV order. The influence of the transfer function may be minimized by reducing the value of the Bessel function. To do so, the argument must be smaller than the order of the Bessel function. Back to the example : For m=1, with a Mach number M=0.3, the argument of the Bessel function is about 4. Avoiding mB-sV less than 4 is required. If V=10, then 13-1x10=3, so there will be a noisy mode. If V=19, the minimum of mB-sV is 6, and the noise emission will be limited. Remark : The case that is to be strictly avoided is when mB-sV can be nul, which causes the order of the Bessel function to be 0. As a consequence, care must be taken regarding B and V as prime numbers. Determination of source levels The minimization of the transfer function {{F_m } \\\\over {P_m }} is a great step in the process of reducing the noise emission. Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, it is necessary to predict the source levels F_{m}. This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significant values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, no consideration are taken for the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV. The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory, which will not be explicated here. Directivity All this study was made for a privileged direction : the axis of the rotor–stator. All the results are acceptable when the noise reduction is ought to be in this direction. In the case where the noise to reduce is perpendicular to the axis, the results are very different, as those figures shown : For B=13 and V=13, which is the worst case, the sound level is very high on the axis (for \\\\theta = 0) For B=13 and V=19, the sound level is very low on the axis but high perpendicularly to the axis (for \\\\theta = Pi/2) File:Acoustics 1319.jpg External links * Category:Aerodynamics ","title":"Rotor–stator interaction"},{"id":"3778795","text":"Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds is the debut EP by the Swedish melodic death metal band Amon Amarth, released in April 1996 by Pulverised Records.

The incumbent local exchange carrier in 306 and 639 is SaskTel. The main area code, 306, is one of the original 86 area codes that were assigned in 1947 in the contiguous United States and the then-nine-province extent of Canada. Saskatchewan's second area code, 639, was introduced in 2012, and is an overlay of 306. By the mid-2000s, 306 was on the brink of exhaustion due to Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. All competitive local exchange carriers in Canada are allocated exclusive access to at least one three-digit prefix – comprising 10,000 numbers each – for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even for the smallest hamlets. While each competing carrier does not necessarily need that many numbers in a particular market, unused numbers are unavailable for use elsewhere once assigned to a particular carrier and rate centre. Since number pooling is not used as a relief measure in Canada, this resulted in thousands of wasted numbers. The number shortage was exacerbated by the proliferation of cell phones and other mobile devices requiring unique telephone numbers, particularly in Regina and Saskatoon. In 2011, the Canadian Radio and Television Commission allocated a second area code to Saskatchewan, 639. Unlike what was previously done in jurisdictions such as neighbouring Alberta, it was decided to implement the new area code as an overlay rather than a split. While this had the effect of allocating 15.8 million numbers to a province of just over a million people, SaskTel and other carriers wanted to spare existing subscribers, particularly in rural areas, the burden and expense of changing their numbers. Overlays have become the preferred method of area code relief in Canada; no area codes have been split in the country since 1999. Ten-digit dialing began in 2012, and became mandatory throughout the province in May 2013.

The first season of Muppet Babies did so well in the ratings, that CBS decided to expand the series from a half-hour to an hour, pairing Muppet Babies with Little Muppet Monsters. They called the hour-long package Muppets, Babies and Monsters. Plot The show was anchored by three young Muppet monsters: Tug (performed by Richard Hunt), Molly (performed by Camille Bonora), and Boo (performed by David Rudman). The three have started their own basement show following an incident where Scooter has them put in the basement after Molly and Boo played water polo in the living room. They are joined by Nicky Napoleon (performed by James Kroupa) and his Emperor Penguins as their music act. Production Storyboard director Scott Shaw discussed the show in MuppetZine issue #3 (Winter 1993). \\"The concept of this second half-hour was neither simple nor particularly well-developed,\\" he said. \\"A trio of new (live-action) Muppet Monster Kids, working from the basement of the adult Muppets' home, create their own television station which broadcasts only to the TV sets in the house upstairs. Their 'shows' were such regular segments as \\"Pigs in Space: The Animated Series\\", \\"Kermit the Frog, Private Eye\\", \\"Muppet Sport Shorts\\" with Animal, \\"Gonzo's Freaky Facts and Oddball Achievements,\\" and \\"Fozzie's Comedy Corner\\", among others. Although thirteen episodes were produced (most of which were incomplete at the time of cancellation), only three of them ever aired. According to Muppet performer Kathryn Mullen, and the Henson Company archives, Marvel Productions failed to deliver the full season's animated segments in time for airing. CBS responded by rerunning episodes of Muppet Babies to fill the second half hour until Marvel finished the series' animated segments. Due to high ratings from the Muppet Babies reruns, the network decided not to pick up the remaining episodes of Little Muppet Monsters. The three completed episodes never appeared on television after their initial air dates. Plans to officially re-release the three episodes have not been made. Despite its quick cancellation, the theme song to Little Muppet Monsters lived on; the instrumental version of the song became the closing theme for Muppet Babies and remained so until the show ended in 1991. In 1991, segments of the animated \\"Pigs in Space\\" and \\"Kermit the Frog, Private Eye\\" from the second episode of Little Muppet Monsters titled \\"Space Cowboys\\" were re-shown in the final episode of Muppet Babies titled \\"Eight Flags Over the Nursery\\".

It was an offshoot of the militant suffragettes after the Pankhursts decide to rule without democratic support from their members. History The group was founded in 1907 by seventy-seven members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) including Teresa Billington-Greig, Charlotte Despard, Alice Schofield, Edith How-Martyn and Margaret Nevinson. They disagreed with Christabel Pankhurst's announcement that the WSPU's annual conference was cancelled and that future decisions would be taken by a committee which she would appoint. The League opposed violence in favour of non-violent forms of protest such as the non-payment of taxes, refusing to complete census forms and organising demonstrations, including members chaining themselves to objects in the Houses of Parliament. It grew to over 4,000 members and published The Vote newspaper weekly from 1909–1933.The Publishers Weekly 1909 – Volume 76 – Page 1922 \\"A New woman suffrage weekly paper has just appeared in London, entitled The Vote.\\" Sarah Benett was the League's Treasurer until her resignation in 1910. Dr Elizabeth Knight was a source of funds for the Women's Freedom League. She took over as Treasurer from Constance Tite in 1912 where she improved the WFL's financial situation. Before she was appointed, the league had had serious financial problems and on occasions had had to appeal to its members for loans. Knight introduced new fund raising schemes for the league although finances were improved by large donations by an \\"anonymous\\" person. It is suspected that this person was Knight.http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2516/1/DX178742.pdf 4 July 1930 issue of The Vote In 1912, Nina Boyle became head of the WFL's political and militant department.R M Douglas, Feminist freikorps: the British voluntary women police, 1914–1940 ; Praeger, 1999 p. 10 She published many articles in the WFL's newspaper, The Vote. Boyle started a campaign for women to become Special Constables. This campaign coincided with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and the call for volunteers for the war effort which Boyle wished to see taken up by women as well as men.The Times, 15 August 1914 p. 9 When the request was officially refused, Boyle, together with Margaret Damer Dawson, a wealthy philanthropist and herself a campaigner for women's rights, established the first voluntary women's police force-the Women Police Volunteers (WPV). The League continued their pacifism during the First World War, supporting the Women's Peace Council. On the outbreak of war, they had suspended their campaigns and undertook voluntary work In the 1918 general election, Despard, How-Martyn and Emily Frost Phipps stood unsuccessfully in London constituencies as independent women's rights anti-war candidates. They celebrated the achievement of suffrage and refocussed the WFL's activities on equality, including equal pay and equality of morality. The group declined in membership, but continued under the leadership of Marian Reeves to organise annual birthday parties for Despard, and maintain the Minerva Club in Brunswick Square. After Reeves' died in 1961, the organisation voted to dissolve itself. The Vote and growth in the Women's Freedom League  After the creation of the Women's Freedom League in 1907, it grew rapidly throughout Great Britain. The league consisted of sixty branches and had nearly four thousand members. The league established its own newspaper called The Vote. Members of the League who were writers led to the production of the newspaper. The Vote became the primary means of communication with the public, informing readers of campaigns, protests, and events. The newspaper helped to spread ideas concerning the First World War, allowing for the Women's Freedom League to advocate against the war. Members of the League refused to become involved in campaigning efforts led by the British Army. Members were upset when their women’s suffrage campaign came to a halt while the war was in progress.  Protests and events  The League's main objective was to criticise, oppose and reform the government. The League held protests that advocated pacifism during the First World War. Not only did the League oppose the war, but they also used peaceful forms of protest only such as refusing to complete census forms and not paying taxes. For example, in 1908 and 1909 the members chained themselves to various objects in Parliament in order to protest against the Government. On 28 October 1908, three members of the Women's Freedom League, Muriel Matters, Violet Tillard, and Helen Fox, released a banner at the House of Commons. The women also chained themselves to the grille above a window. Law enforcement had to remove the grille while they were still attached until they could file off the locks that held them connected to the window. This protest became known as the Grille Incident. Anna Munro advertising the Scottish Women's Freedom League Two members of the League, Alice Chapin and Alison Neilans, attacked polling stations during the 1909 Bermondsey by- election, smashing bottles containing corrosive liquid over ballot boxes in an attempt to destroy votes. A presiding officer, George Thornley, was blinded in one eye in one of these attacks, and a Liberal agent suffered a severe burn to the neck. The count was delayed while ballot papers were carefully examined, 83 ballot papers were damaged but legible but two ballot papers became undecipherable.The Times, 29 October 1909 Later they were sentenced to three months each in Holloway Prison. The \\"Brown Women\\" were named after the brown coats that the walkers wore. Agnes Brown (coincidentally), Isabel Cowe and four others set off from Edinburgh to walk to London. They had white scarfs and green hats and as they travelled they gathered signatures for a petition for women's rights.Eleanor Gordon, ‘Brown, Agnes Henderson (1866–1943)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 accessed 23 May 2017 The hikers had to walk fifteen miles and attend a meeting each day and in this way they took five weeks to get to London.

His images documented the ethnography of various American classes and cultures. Life Russell Lee, Farm Security Administration photographer FSA photographers (from left) John Vachon, Arthur Rothstein and Russell Lee with Roy Stryker The son of Burton Lee and wife Adeline Werner, Lee grew up in Ottawa, Illinois, and went to the Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana for high school. He earned a degree in chemical engineering from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He gave up a position as a chemist to become a painter. Originally he used photography as a precursor to his painting, but soon became interested in photography for its own sake, recording the people and places around him. Among his earliest subjects were Pennsylvanian bootleg mining and the Father Divine cult. In the fall of 1936, during the Great Depression, Lee was hired for the federally sponsored Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographic documentation project of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. He joined a team assembled under Roy Stryker, along with Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein and Walker Evans. Stryker provided direction and bureaucratic protection to the group, leaving the photographers free to compile what in 1973 was described as \\"the greatest documentary collection which has ever been assembled.\\" Lee created some of the iconic images produced by the FSA, including photographic studies of San Augustine, Texas in 1939, and Pie Town, New Mexico in 1940. Over the spring and summer of 1942, Lee was one of several government photographers to document the eviction of Japanese Americans from the West Coast, producing over 600 images of families waiting to be removed and their later life in various detention facilities. After the FSA was defunded in 1943, Lee served in the Air Transport Command (ATC), during which he took photographs of all the airfield approaches used by the ATC to supply the Armed Forces in World War II. He worked for the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) in 1946 and 1947, helping the agency compile a medical survey in the communities involved in mining bituminous coal. He created over 4,000 photographs of miners and their working conditions in coal mines. In 1946, Lee completed a series of photos focused on a Pentecostal Church of God in a Kentucky coal camp. While completing the DOI work, Lee also continued to work under Stryker, producing public relations photographs for Standard Oil of New Jersey. In 1947 Lee moved to Austin, Texas and continued photography. In 1965 he became the first instructor of photography at the University of Texas.

The 403 area code was one of the original 89 area codes assigned in 1947 in the contiguous United States and the then nine-province extent of Canada. It originally encompassed the whole province of Alberta, the Yukon and the western half of the Northwest Territories. It was the second-largest numbering plan area in the North American Numbering Plan, spanning more than one-ninth of the circumference of the planet from the 49th parallel north to the North Pole. On October 3, 1997, 403 was cut back to Alberta, when the territories were split off as their own separate area code, 867. Within only a year, 403 was back to the brink of exhaustion due to Canada's number allocation system. Every local exchange carrier is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers–corresponding to a single three- digit prefix–for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even for the smallest hamlets. While most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers, it is not possible to move a number from one rate centre to another. This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers, and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers–especially in Calgary and Edmonton–only exacerbated this. On January 25, 1999, the northern two-thirds of Alberta, including Edmonton, was split into the new area code 780. Generally, everything from Red Deer, Lacombe and Ponoka southward stayed in 403. Permissive dialing of 403 continued across the province until May 18, 1999. This was intended as a long-term solution, but within a decade 403 was close to exhaustion once again. To solve the problem, it was decided to implement area code 587 as a province-wide overlay. Optional provincewide 10-digit dialing began on June 23, 2008, and became mandatory on September 12, 2008. On September 20, 2008, Telus Mobility began assigning 587 numbers to new customers in Calgary and Edmonton. The incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) in 403 is Telus; prior to 1997, the larger 403 included EdTel (Edmonton Telephones, now part of Telus) and Northwestel as incumbent LECs. Prior to 1990, Telus was known as Alberta Government Telephones, and was a department of the provincial government.http://www.abheritage.ca/telephone/era/agt.html Communities included 976 calls require dialling 1 before any AB area code. *Calgary (403)-200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 225 226 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 303 305 312 313 319 333 338 351 354 355 365 366 367 369 370 371 374 375 383 384 385 386 387 389 390 397 398 399 400 401 402 404 407 408 410 428 437 440 441 444 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 481 483 487 500 503 508 509 510 512 513 514 515 516 517 519 520 521 523 530 531 532 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 547 554 560 561 567 568 569 570 571 585 589 590 592 604 605 606 607 608 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 629 630 640 645 648 650 651 656 660 661 662 663 667 668 669 670 671 680 681 685 686 689 690 691 692 693 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 705 708 710 714 716 717 718 719 720 723 724 726 727 730 731 735 736 744 747 750 764 765 766 767 769 770 771 774 775 776 777 781 796 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 813 815 816 817 818 819 826 827 828 829 830 831 835 836 837 850 852 860 861 862 863 869 870 873 874 875 879 880 888 889 890 891 899 906 909 910 918 919 920 921 922 923 926 927 931 943 944 955 956 966 968 969 970 971 973 974 975 978 984 987 988 990 991 992 993 997 998 999 *Acme (403)-546 *Airdrie (403)-316 420 768 912 945 948 960 980 *Banff (403)-431 497 760 762 763 778 951 985 996 *Beiseker (403)-947 *Black Diamond (403)-933 *Blackfalds (403)-600 885 *Brooks (403)-362 363 376 409 427 501 633 793 794 925 *Canmore (403)-493 609 621 675 678 679 688 707 812 953 961 *Cardston (403)-653 659 *Carstairs (403)-337 940 *Castor (403)-882 *Cereal (403)-326 *Claresholm (403)-468 489 490 625 682 706 *Coaldale (403)-345 405 *Cochrane (403)-709 840 851 855 907 932 981 *Cremona (403)-637 *Crossfield (403)-941 946 *Crowsnest Pass (403)-372 459 562 563 564 582 583 623 *Didsbury (403)-335 439 518 *Drumheller (403)-321 334 436 494 820 821 823 856 *East Coulee (403)-822 *Eckville (403)-746 *High River (403)-336 422 469 498 601 602 603 649 652 841 908 *Innisfail (403)-227 *Irricana (403)-935 *Irvine (403)-834 *Kananaskis Improvement District (403)-591 *Lacombe (403)-782 786 789 *Lake Louise (403)-434 522 *Langdon (403)-936 954 *Leslieville (403)-729 *Lethbridge (403)-308 315 317 320 327 328 329 330 331 332 353 359 360 380 381 382 388 393 394 524 593 634 635 694 715 795 849 892 894 915 929 942 *Longview (403)-558 *Medicine Hat (403)-458 487 488 502 504 525 526 527 528 529 548 580 581 594 712 866 878 905 926 928 952 957 977 979 *Morley (403)-881 *Okotoks (403)-306 842 917 938 939 982 995 *Olds (403)-415 438 507 556 559 586 672 791 994 *Pincher Creek (403)-339 432 484 624 627 632 683 *Ponoka (403)-704 783 785 790 913 963 *Red Deer (403)-302 304 307 309 314 318 340 341 342 343 346 347 348 349 350 352 356 357 358 373 391 392 396 406 505 506 550 588 596 597 598 713 754 755 848 872 877 896 967 986 *Rocky Mountain House (403)-322 418 429 844 845 846 847 871 895 *Stettler (403)-323 430 740 741 742 743 916 *Strathmore (403)-324 325 361 480 499 814 901 902 934 962 983 *Sylvan Lake (403)-858 864 887 *Taber (403)-223 416 *Three Hills (403)-443 *Turner Valley (403)-933 Relief Planning The projected exhaust date for Area Code 403 was March 2009.

Simon Kovar was born Simon Kovarski in Vilnius, Lithuania, then a part of Russia, in 1890. He took up the bassoon at age 20 after originally studying the violin. Kovar came to the United States in June 1922, settling in New York City where he took the position of second bassoonist with the New York Philharmonic. He was highly regarded as a teacher and was head of the bassoon faculty at the Juilliard School of Music for 28 years. Kovar also taught at Teachers College at Columbia University, the Music Academy of the West, and the Curtis Institute of Music, the Manhattan School of Music, Mannes College of Music, and the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. His students ranged from top orchestra bassoonists, including Sol Schoenbach and Bernard Garfield to jazz musicians, including saxophonists Stan Getz and Ray Pizzi. His 24 Daily Studies for Bassoon, written in the late 1950s, are considered first-rate practice exercises for the bassoon. In the 1950s, Kovar moved to Encino, California where he continued teaching almost until the time of his death in 1970 from complications related to emphysema. He was survived by his wife Rose Kovar and two daughters, Eleanor Imber, also a professional bassoonist, and Leah Herzberg.

The code was established in 1999; prior to this date the entire province was served by the 403 area code. Although Alberta would have likely needed another area code in any event due to its rapid growth in the second half of the 20th century, the 1999 split was hastened by Canada's number allocation system. Every local exchange carrier is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers, each block corresponding to a single prefix, for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even for the smallest hamlets.

The governments of Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania were members of NEMMCO; and each nominated a director to the NEMMCO board. NEMMCO was a company under Corporations law. It operated on a break-even basis by recovering the costs of operating the NEM and running the organisation by levying fees against market participants. The fees were complex, and comprised both fixed and variable components that took into account the type of participant and their share of trade in the market. The structure of fees payable to NEMMCO was determined periodically, while the actual fee levels were set annually. NEMMCO managed the market and power system from two control centres in different states. Both centres operated around the clock, and were equipped with identical communication and information technology systems. The entire NEM, or individual regions within it, could be operated from either or both centres. This arrangement was a means of ensuring continuous supply despite the risks that natural disasters or other events presented, and provided NEMMCO with the flexibility to respond quickly to dramatic changes in the market or the power system.

History The name Agualva-Cacém belonged to a civil parish that encompassed of the municipality of Sintra. On 12 July 2001, that parish was elevated to the status of city and divided into four civil parishes (24 July 2001).

Geography Agualva-Cacém is divided into four civil parishes, which fall within a territorial extent within the Greater Lisbon subregion, an area of mostly residential suburbs. With the Reorganização Administrativa do Território das Freguesias (Administrative Reorganization of the Territory of Parishes) - Law Nº. 11-A/2013, 21st of January, 2013, the four parishes were merged in two unions of parishes: União das Freguesias de Agualva e Mira- Sintra and União das Freguesias do Cacém e S.

This includes both New Age and modern Western interpretations of traditional Hindu and Buddhist tantra. Some of its proponents refer to ancient and traditional texts and principles,Yoga Spandakarika: The Sacred Texts at the Origins of Tantra, Daniel Odier (2004)The Yoga of Delight, Wonder, and Astonishment, A Translation of the Vijnaya-bhairava, Jaideva Singh, Motilal Banarsidass Publisher (1991) and many others use tantra as a catch-all phrase for \\"sacred sexuality\\", and may incorporate unorthodox practices. In addition, not all of the elements of Indian tantric practices are used in neotantra, in particular the reliance on a guru. As interest in Tantra has grown in the West, its perception has deviated from the Tantric traditions. It was seen as a \\"cult of ecstasy\\", combining sexuality and spirituality to change Western attitudes towards sex. Hence for many modern readers tantra is now synonymous with \\"spiritual sex\\" or \\"sacred sexuality,\\" a belief that sex should be recognized as a sacred act capable of elevating its participants to a higher spiritual plane. Tantric sexuality As tantric practice became known in western culture, which has escalated since the 1960s, it has become identified with its sexual methods in the West. Practitioners Sir John George Woodroffe, also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon, was a British Orientalist whose work helped to unleash in the West a deep and wide interest in Hindu philosophy and Yogic practices. Alongside his judicial duties he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy and was especially interested in Hindu Tantra. He translated some twenty original Sanskrit texts and published and lectured prolifically on Indian philosophy and a wide range of Yoga and Solo Tantra topics.T.M.P. Mahadevan, foreword to; Arthur Avalon, Garland of Letters, Ganesh and Company Madras, 6th ed. 1974 p iii. Woodroffe's The Serpent Power – The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga, is a source for many modern Western adaptations of Kundalini yoga practice. It is a philosophically sophisticated commentary on, and translation of, the Satcakra-nirupana (\\"Description of and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centres\\") of Purnananda (dated around AD 1550) and the Paduka-Pancaka (\\"Five-fold Footstool of the Guru\\"). The term \\"Serpent Power\\" refers to the kundalini, an energy said to be released within an individual by meditation techniques.Sir John Woodroffe. The Serets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga. Dover Publications NY 1974. p 313 Pierre Bernard was a pioneering American yogi, scholar, occultist, philosopher, mystic, and businessman. He claimed to have traveled to Kashmir and Bengal before founding the Tantrik Order of America in 1905.Stirling 2006, pg. 7 He eventually expanded to a chain of tantric clinics in places such as Cleveland, Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City. Bernard is widely credited with being the first American to introduce the philosophy and practices of yoga and tantra to the American people. He also played a critical role in establishing a greatly exaggerated association of tantra with the use of sex for mystical purposes in the American mindset. Many teachers of this version of tantra believe that sex and sexual experiences are sacred acts, which are capable of elevating their participants to a higher spiritual plane.Sacred Orgasms, Kenneth Ray Stubbs (1992) They often talk about raising Kundalini energy,Kundalini: Evolution and Enlightenment, Edited by John White, Paragon House (1979), Page 27-47Tantric Yoga: The Royal Path to Raising Kundalini Power, Gavin and Yvonne Frost, Samuel Weiser Publishing (1989) worshipping the divine feminine and the divine masculine, activating the chakras.Jewel in the Lotus: The Sexual Path to Higher Consciousness, Sunyata Saraswati and Bodhi Avinasha, Kriya Jyoti Tantra Society (1987), Pages 77-90 Guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, later known as Osho, used his version of tantra in combination with breathing techniques, bio-energy, yoga, and massage in some of the groups at his ashram. He is the author of many books on meditation, taoism, buddhism, and mysticism, and at least six on tantra. One of them is Tantra, The Supreme Understanding, in which he unpacks the verses of the \\"Song of Mahamudra\\", by Tilopa. In addition out of his discourses on the Vigyan Bhiarav (or Vijnaya- bhairava), the 112 practices for enlightenment resulted in the much longer The Book of Secrets.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (1998) His students continue to develop his concepts. One of Osho's students, Margot Anand, founded a school called \\"Skydancing\\" tantra. She is the author of dozens of books including the Art of Everyday Ecstasy, and the Art of Sexual Magic. Studying with tantric teachers of different lineages since the 90's, Marion Ellyard co founded the Taste of Love Tantra School and Australia's biggest tantra festival the 'Taste of Love Festival'. \\"Tantra, a profound spiritual and physiological system of teaching and healing, which came to the West around 40 years ago for the first time, now also enjoys cutting edge psychology and somatic therapy processes that ultimately lead to the same place of healing,\\" Marion says. In 1997 Deborah Anapol convened a national Celebration of Eros, \\"a Conference on Sacred Sexuality, bringing together for the first time, teachers from Tantric, Taoist, Sufi, Buddhist, Jewish, Pagan, Hindu, Shinto, Wiccan, Occult, Native American, and Afro-Caribbean traditions.\\" Criticisms Georg Feuerstein, a German Indologist who also trained in tantra, writes in the epilogue of his book Tantra: Path of Ecstasy: > \\"Many are attracted to Neo-Tantrism because it promises sexual excitement or > fulfillment while clothing purely genital impulses or neurotic emotional > needs in an aura of spirituality. If we knew more about the history of > Tantra in India, we would no doubt find a comparable situation for every > generation.\\" He goes on to say, \\"Today translations of several major Tantras > are readily available in book form... This gives would-be Tantrics the > opportunity to concoct their own idiosyncratic ceremonies and philosophies, > which they can then promote as Tantra.\\"Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy, Georg > Feuerstein, Shambala Press (1998), Page 271 Responding to criticism of modern Western Tantra, Geoffrey Samuel, a historian of Indian and Tibetan Tantra writes: According to author and critic of religion and politics Hugh Urban: Urban says he does not consider this \\"wrong\\" or \\"false\\", but \\"simply a different interpretation for a specific historical situation.\\" See also * Chuluaqui-Quodoushka * Edging (sexual practice) * Erotic massage * One Taste (Orgasmic Meditation, slow sex movement) * Sex and eroticism in the Tantra * Sex magic * Venus Butterfly References=NotesCitations * Anand, Margot (1996) The Art of Sexual Magic.

Born in Port Elizabeth, Bisset was the fifth son of James Bisset, engineer and former Mayor of Wynberg, and Emily, née Jarvis, daughter of Hercules Jarvis (MLC, MLA) former Mayor of Cape Town.Beyes, C.J. (1981) The Dictionary of South African Biography, vol. 4, Butterworth & Co., Durban. Cricket career Educated at Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Bisset soon gained a reputation as a batsman and a wicket keeper who could stand up to the fastest bowlers,Martin-Jenkins, C. (1996) World Cricketers: A Biographical Dictionary, Oxford: Oxford University Press. . and made his first class cricket debut for Western Province on 18 April 1895 against Transvaal at Durban, scoring 0 and five not out. Despite this setback, Bisset was a regular member of the Western Province side, scoring an unbeaten 124 against Transvaal in 1897, leading to his announcement as captain of the Western Province side for the Currie Cup final that year. He scored 5 and 63*, enough to secure his position as South African captain against the touring English side in 1898-99. Aged 22, Bisset remained Test cricket's youngest ever captain until Ian Craig captained Australia in 1957.CricInfo Records / Test matches / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) / Youngest captains. Playing as a wicket- keeper batsman, Bisset scored 35 and 21* and took a catch and a stumping. Bisset also captained the Second Test of the series but, due to the vagaries of turn of the century international cricket it would be another 11 years before Bisset played his third and final Test. Bisset studied law and, following graduation, was admitted to the Cape Bar in 1899 and practised in the Cape before serving in the South African War.Rosenthal, E. (1978) Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Juta & Company Ltd: Cape Town. Following his war service, In 1901, Bisset led the South African team to England in the face of fierce criticism that the tour was taking place during the war. Bisset starred on the tour, which did not include a Test, including 184 against Derbyshire, his highest first-class score. Returning to South Africa, Bisset continued to play cricket when his burgeoning legal career allowed. Bisset was recalled for the Fifth Test between South Africa and England at Cape Town in 1909-10, where he kept wicket and batted in the middle order. Following the match, Bisset retired to concentrate on his legal career. In all, Bisset played 40 first-class matches, scoring 1441 runs at 23.62 with two centuries, taking five wickets at 24.40 and taking 51 catches and 13 stumpings. Political career In 1914, Bisset was elected to the House of Assembly as a South African Party representative for South Peninsula, holding his seat until his retirement from politics in 1924.The Times \\"Obituary – Sir Murray Bisset\\", The Times, 26 October 1931, p 19. While in parliament, Bisset unsuccessfully introduced a Private Members Bill in 1921 whereby a widow was lawfully entitled to marry her deceased husband's brother. Following his retirement from politics, Bisset moved to Southern Rhodesia, where he was appointed a senior judge in 1925 and served as Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia from 1927 until his death. Knighted in 1928, Bisset had served as acting Governor of Southern Rhodesia in 1928 and was serving as governor again in 1931 while the Governor Cecil Hunter-Rodwell was in England, when he died in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. He was survived by his wife, Gladys, whom he married in 1905, and one son. Bisset's brothers Edgar and Arthur Bisset, and brother-in- law Archibald Difford also played first-class cricket in South Africa.Cricket Archive Murray Bisset.

History The monastery, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, was founded in 1011 by Saint Gunther, a Benedictine monk of Niederaltaich Abbey, as the first settlement in the central Bavarian Forest. In 1029 Emperor Conrad II endowed the monastery with land. It was made a priory of Niederaltaich in 1040, when Saint Gunther moved on to Gutwasser (the present Dobra Voda) in Bohemia. In 1488 (?) the Hussites burnt the monastery down. In 1703 it was pillaged by Hungarian regiments, but restored in 1708 by Niederaltaich Abbey. The monastery was dissolved in 1803 as a result of the secularisation of Bavaria, and its estates were auctioned off.

An example would be a gridiron football player throwing long passes with an empty backfield on first down in the fourth quarter of a game in which his team was already leading by a large margin. Stat padding is also noticeable in online computer games. A group of players might perform a series of actions which generally require little skill in order to raise a player's statistics. For example, in first person shooters, two or more players might join different teams and constantly kill one another, usually followed by a heal, revive, or respawn. Actions such as these are usually done on password- protected or empty game servers. An example of this in the popular online computer game Battlefield 2 would be when three players collude, one as a medic, another from the other team as a killer, and another person from the medic's team, called the \\"dummy\\", to be the victim. The killer shoots the dummy, and the medic then heals or revives his teammate. The killer shoots the dummy again and the process continues. It is also possible to stat pad by completing objectives or performing actions in an empty server, or by co- operating with a player on another team. While co-operating with players on another team may pad stats, this is widely considered a form of cheating.

Waite was educated at Leeds Parish Church Middle Class School and at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1888 he was appointed sub-curator of the Leeds Museum and three years later was made curator. On 7 April 1892 Waite married Rose Edith Green at St. Matthew's parish church, Leeds. In 1893 Waite became zoologist at the Australian Museum, Sydney, he was the Fish Curator there from 1893 to 1906. Waite accompanied Charles Hedley of the Australian Museum on the 1896 Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society under Professor William Sollas and Professor Edgeworth David. Following the expedition to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu) Waite published an account of The mammals, reptiles, and fishes of Funafuti. In the scientific discipline of herpetology he described several new species of reptiles.The Reptile Database. www.reptile- database.org. In 1898 Waite published Popular Account of Australian Snakes. He was with the trawling expedition conducted by the H.M.C.S Thetis and wrote the report on the fish, and he also reported on the fish trawled by the Western Australian government. He was involved in several expeditions to sub- Anatarctic islands - including the 1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition, New Guinea, and the Australian interior. By the time Waite's employment ended at the Australian Museum, the collection contained 18,000 specimens. He was later the Curator of the Canterbury Museum in New Zealand for eight years, before accepting the Directorship at the South Australian Museum in March 1914. Waite was the first Australian ichthyologist to use detailed illustrations in his papers. During his career, he published around 140 papers, more than half were on fish. His major contribution to Australian ichthyology was The Fishes of South Australia (1923). In 1926 Waite spent time studying European and American museums; while in New York City he arranged the Australian section of a museum there. He had contracted malaria while in New Guinea, and suffered from poor health from that time. Waite died on 19 January 1928 from enteric fever while at Hobart attending a meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. He was survived by a widow and a son. Although of a retiring disposition, Waite was a man of great versatility. He was a linguist and musician, could draw and paint in water- colour, was an expert modeller, had some knowledge of mechanics, and was a capable photographer. Most of these things were useful in his work as curator of a museum, and as such his reputation stood very high. As a scientist his most important work was on the vertebrates. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society from an early age, and at the time of his death was a vice-president of the Royal Society of South Australia. He contributed over 200 papers to various scientific publications. A species of Australian blind snake, Ramphotyphlops waitii, is named in his honour.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Association with John Burt During his trial, Griffin's lead defense attorney, Robert Kerrigan, argued that John Burt \\"brainwashed\\" Griffin and drove him to commit murder. At the time, Burt was the Northwest Florida regional director of the national pro-life group Rescue America. Burt was a retired U.S. Marine and former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claims to have \\"abandoned the group's racist doctrine when he became a born-again Christian\\") and a self-professed \\"spiritual adviser\\" to a group of activists who bombed three abortion clinics in 1984.

Tiger Lily Records (United States) The United States version of Tiger Lily Records was a record label that was run by Roulette Records founder Morris Levy. Purportedly it was a tax scam created by Levy and was never intended to make a profit. Tiger Lily's primary modus operandi was to acquire demo tapes from artists or studios and then release them without the artists consent and sometimes without even the artist's knowledge. Other albums released by Tiger Lily have been identified as bootlegs of albums released in the early 1970s by Artie Ripp's Family Productions and two cases of performers who were actually signed to Tiger Lily Records have been identified. The most prominent artists known to have a record released by Tiger Lily were Richard Pryor, whose album L.A. Jail was released by Tiger Lily, and Rod Stewart, who had a live recording of him in performance at the 1973 Reading and Leeds Festivals released by Tiger Lily in 1976 under the title Reading Festival Featuring Rod Stewart. The album credited to Stewart was really a collection of various artists from the Reading Festival, with Rod Stewart and the Faces only appearing on one track. The album Stonewall, credited to a band of the same name, has sold for as much as $14,100. Along with Guinness Records, Tiger Lily was one of the major tax scam labels of the 1970s with around 70 albums being released. The types of albums released by Tiger Lily fell into several broad categories: * Single band/artist albums based on unpublished material. (e.g., \\"Glenn Faria\\", \\"Stonewall\\") * Compilation albums based on unpublished material disguised as the debut album of a single band. (e.g., \\"Made From Plate\\") * Bootleg re- issues of albums previously published on obscure labels. (e.g., \\"Sleepy Hollow\\") * Bootleg albums based on live recordings. (e.g., \\"L.A Jail\\", \\"Reading Festival Featuring Rod Stewart\\") * Material recorded by bands/artists signed to Tiger Lily Records. (e.g., \\"Airborne\\", \\"Pressed For Time\\") Tiger Lily Records (Canada) The Tiger Lily Records name is now held by a reputable Canadian company. They have been in operation since approximately 1998. Their brand encompasses Tiger Lily Records, Tiger Lily Records Canada and Tiger Lily Music.

Most modern anatomists define 17 of these muscles, although some additional muscles may sometimes be considered. These are often divided into four groups according to their orientation around the hip joint: the gluteal group; the lateral rotator group; the adductor group; and the iliopsoas group. Structure The muscles of the hip consist of four main groups Gluteal group The gluteal muscles include the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. They cover the lateral surface of the ilium. The gluteus maximus, which forms most of the muscle of the buttocks, originates primarily on the ilium and sacrum and inserts on the gluteal tuberosity of the femur as well as the iliotibial tract, a tract of strong fibrous tissue that runs along the lateral thigh to the tibia and fibula. The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus originate anterior to the gluteus maximus on the ilium and both insert on the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae shares its origin with the gluteus maximus at the ilium and also shares the insertion at the iliotibial tract. Adductor group The adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus, pectineus, and gracilis make up the adductor group. The adductors all originate on the pubis and insert on the medial, posterior surface of the femur, with the exception of the gracilis which inserts just below the medial condyle of the tibia. Iliopsoas group The iliacus and psoas major comprise the iliopsoas group. The psoas major is a large muscle that runs from the bodies and disc of the L1 to L5 vertebrae, joins with the iliacus via its tendon, and connects to the lesser trochanter of the femur. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa of the ilium. Together these muscles are commonly referred to as the \\"iliopsoas\\". Lateral rotator group This group consists of the externus and internus obturators, the piriformis, the superior and inferior gemelli, and the quadratus femoris. These six originate at or below the acetabulum of the ilium and insert on or near the greater trochanter of the femur. Other hip muscles Additional muscles, such as the rectus femoris and the sartorius, can cause some movement in the hip joint. However these muscles primarily move the knee, and not generally classified as muscles of the hip. The hamstring muscles, which originate mostly from the ischial tuberosity inserting on the tibia/fibula, have a large moment assisting with hip extension. Function Movements of the hip occur because multiple muscles activate at once. Most muscles are also responsible for more than one type of movement. Movements of the hip are described in anatomical terminology using anatomical terms of motion. The movement that brings the thighs close to the abdomen is called \\"flexion\\". When the legs open, such as in the lotus posture of yoga, this is called \\"lateral rotation\\", with the opposite movement called \\"medial rotation\\". Hip abduction occurs when the femur moves outward to the side, as in taking the thighs apart. Hip adduction occurs when the femur moves back to the midline. Many muscles contribute to these movements: * The psoas is the primary hip flexor, assisted by the iliacus. The pectineus, the adductors longus, brevis, and magnus, as well as the tensor fasciae latae are also involved in flexion. * The gluteus maximus is the main hip extensor, but the inferior portion of the adductor magnus also plays a role. * The adductor group is responsible for hip adduction. * Medial rotation is performed by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus, as well as the tensor fasciae latae and assisted by the adductors brevis and longus and the superior portion of the adductor magnus. * Each muscle of the lateral rotator group causes lateral rotation of the thigh. These muscles are aided by the gluteus maximus and the inferior portion of the adductor magnus. Hip muscles also play a role in maintaining the standing posture. These muscles work in an integrated system with muscles of the shoulder, neck, core, lower leg, and supporting muscles of the spine, to provide the ability to stand with good posture. These muscles include the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus which abduct the thigh, prevent swaying of hips, stabilize pelvic region while keeping hips level, and shift an individual’s weight in order to adjust body placement to increase one's overall body stability.

A lower-order batsman, medium-pace bowler and a safe pair of hands in the field, Robert Graham played first-class cricket from 1898 to 1901. He made his debut for Western Province against Transvaal in the Currie Cup final of 1897–98 but did nothing of note in the victory that gave his side their fourth domestic title. However, he took 5 for 54 in his next match playing for Cape Colony against Lord Hawke's touring side of 1898–99 and was subsequently selected for the First Test. He took two wickets for 60 runs in the match and held two catches as England won by 32 runs. He then took 6 wickets for 97 runs, again for a Cape Colony XI against the tourists, which secured his place for the Second Test, in which he took one wicket for 67 and scored only two runs, a victim of Albert Trott in both innings. After two seasons out of the first-class game Graham was invited to tour England with South Africa in 1901. On the trip he recorded his highest first-class score, 63 not out against Leicestershire, and took five wickets in an innings three times. These came in both innings of the match against Derbyshire – 6 for 84 and 5 for 47, thereby also giving him his only haul of ten wickets in a match – and the match against Worcestershire, 8 for 90. He played no further first-class cricket after the tour. No obituary appeared in Wisden for Graham after his death in 1946. He was the brother of J.M. Graham (Transvaal), the nephew of D.K.

It is endemic to Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.Clarke 1997, p. 123. Nepenthes rajah grows exclusively on serpentine substrates, particularly in areas of seeping ground water where the soil is loose and permanently moist. The species has an altitudinal range of a.s.l. and is thus considered a highland or sub-alpine plant. Due to its localised distribution, N. rajah is classified as an endangered species by the IUCN and listed on CITES Appendix I. The species was collected by Hugh Low on Mount Kinabalu in 1858, and described the next year by Joseph Dalton Hooker, who named it after James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. Hooker called it \\"one of the most striking vegetable productions hither-to discovered\\".Hooker 1859. Since being introduced into cultivation in 1881, Nepenthes rajah has always been a much sought-after species. For a long time, the plant was seldom seen in private collections due to its rarity, price, and specialised growing requirements. However, recent advances in tissue culture technology have resulted in prices falling dramatically, and N. rajah is now relatively widespread in cultivation. Nepenthes rajah is most famous for the giant urn-shaped traps it produces, which can grow up to 41 cm highHamilton, G. 2011. The Sabah Society. and 20 cm wide.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. These are capable of holding 3.5 litres of water and in excess of 2.5 litres of digestive fluid, making them probably the largest in the genus by volume. Another morphological feature of N. rajah is the peltate leaf attachment of the lamina and tendril, which is present in only a few other species. Nepenthes rajah traps vertebrates and even small mammals, with drowned rats having been observed in the pitcher-shaped traps.Phillipps 1988, p. 55. It is one of only three Nepenthes species documented as having caught mammalian prey in the wild, the others being N. rafflesiana and N. attenboroughii. N. rajah is also known to occasionally trap small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals and certainly do not represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the staple prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Although Nepenthes rajah is most famous for trapping and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host to a large number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah. Another key feature of N. rajah is the relative ease with which it is able to hybridise in the wild. Hybrids between it and all other Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu have been recorded. However, due to the slow-growing nature of N. rajah, few hybrids involving the species have been artificially produced yet. Etymology James Brooke Joseph Dalton Hooker described Nepenthes rajah in 1859, naming it in honour of Sir James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak.Kurata 1976, p. 61. In the past, the Latin name was written as Nepenthes Rajah,Masters 1881.Reginald 1883.Hemsley 1905.Danser 1928, 38. since it derives from a proper noun. However, this capitalisation is considered incorrect today. 'Rajah Brooke's Pitcher Plant'Phillipps & Lamb 1996, p. 129. is an accurate, but seldom-used common name. N. rajah is also sometimes called the 'Giant Malaysian Pitcher Plant'Gibson 1983. or simply 'Giant Pitcher Plant', although the binomial name remains by far the most popular way of referring to this species. The specific epithet rajah means \\"King\\" in Malay and this, coupled with the impressive size of its pitchers, has meant that N. rajah is often referred to as the \\"King of Nepenthes\\".Steiner 2002, p. 94. Plant characteristics Mature plants bearing both lower and upper pitchers The characteristic peltate leaf attachment of N. rajah Nepenthes rajah, like virtually all species in the genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30 mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m.Clarke 1997, pp. 10, 120. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age. Leaves Leaves are produced at regular intervals along the stem. They are connected to the stem by sheathed structures known as petioles. A long, narrow tendril emanates from the end of each leaf. At the tip of the tendril is a small bud which, when physiologically activated, develops into a functioning trap. Hence, the pitchers are modified leaves and not specialised flowers as is often believed. The green structure most similar to a normal leaf is specifically known as the lamina or leaf blade. The leaves of N. rajah are very distinctive and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is more pronounced in N. rajah than in any other Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is not unique to these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5 cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50 cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to lanceolate- shaped, ≤80 cm long and ≤15 cm wide. A typical terrestrial pitcher Pitchers All Nepenthes pitchers share several basic characteristics. Traps consist of the main pitcher cup, which is covered by an operculum or lid that prevents rainwater from entering the pitcher and displacing or diluting its contents. A reflexed ring of hardened tissue, known as the peristome, surrounds the entrance to the pitcher (only the aerial pitchers of N. inermis lack a peristome). A pair of fringed wings run down the front of lower traps and these presumably serve to guide terrestrial insects into the pitchers' mouth. Accordingly, the wings are greatly reduced or completely lacking in aerial pitchers, for which flying insects constitute the majority of prey items. Nepenthes rajah, like most species in the genus, produces two distinct types of traps. \\"Lower\\" or \\"terrestrial\\" pitchers are the most common. These are very large, richly coloured, and ovoid in shape. In lower pitchers, the tendril attachment occurs at the front of the pitcher cup relative to the peristome and wings. Exceptional specimens may be more than 40 cm in length and hold 3.5 litres of water and in excess of 2.5 litres of digestive fluid, although most do not exceed 200 ml.Clarke 2001b, p. 7. The 41 cm pitcher found on The Sabah Society's March 2011 trip to Mesilau The largest recorded pitcher of N. rajah, measuring 41 cm, was found on March 26, 2011, during a trip to Mesilau organised by The Sabah Society. The trap was discovered next to a steep sidepath of the Mesilau nature trail and was measured by Alex Lamb, son of Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb, who were also on the trip. It was collected for preservation at Mesilau Headquarters. Another trap measuring 40 cm was spotted on the same day. The previous record for a N. rajah pitcher was 38 cm. The lower pitchers of N. rajah are probably the largest in the genus by volume, rivaled only by those of N. merrilliana, N. truncata and the giant form of N. rafflesiana. These traps rest on the ground and are often reclined, leaning against surrounding objects for support. They are usually red to purple on the outside, whilst the inside surfaces are lime green to purple. This contrasts with all other parts of the plant, which are yellow-green. The lower pitchers of N. rajah are unmistakable and for this reason it is easy to distinguish it from all other Bornean Nepenthes species.Clarke 2001b, p. 26. A rare aerial pitcher Mature plants may also produce \\"upper\\" or \\"aerial\\" pitchers, which are much smaller, funnel-shaped, and usually more colourful than the lowers. The tendril attachment in upper pitchers is normally present at the rear of the pitcher cup. True upper pitchers are seldom seen, as the stems of N. rajah rarely attain lengths greater than a few metres before dying off and being replaced by off-shoots from the main rootstock.Clarke & Kruger 2005. Upper and lower pitchers differ significantly in morphology, as they are specialised for attracting and capturing different prey. Pitchers that do not fall directly into either category are simply known as \\"intermediate\\" pitchers. The peristome of N. rajah has a highly distinctive scalloped edge and is greatly expanded, forming an attractive red lip around the trap's mouth. A series of raised protrusions, known as ribs, intersect the peristome, ending in short, sharp teeth that line its inner margin. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 80% of its total cross-sectional surface length in this species.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90–102. Two fringed wings run from the tendril attachment to the lower edge of the peristome. The huge, vaulted lid of N. rajah, the largest in the genus, is another distinguishing characteristic of this species. It is ovate to oblong in shape and has a distinct keel running down the middle, with two prominent lateral veins. Schmid-Hollinger, R. N.d. Kannendeckel (lid). bio-schmidhol.ch. The spur at the back of the lid is approximately 20 mm long and unbranched.Clarke 1997, p. 122. Nepenthes rajah is noted for having very large nectar-secreting glands covering its pitchers. These are quite different from those of any other Nepenthes and are easily recognisable. The inner surface of the pitcher, in particular, is wholly glandular, with 300 to 800 glands/cm². Flowers A flowering plant of N. rajah Nepenthes rajah seems to flower at any time of the year. Flowers are produced in large numbers on inflorescences that arise from the apex of the main stem. N. rajah produces a very large inflorescence that can be 80 cm, and sometimes even 120 cm tall. The individual flowers of N. rajah are produced on partial peduncles (twin stalks) and so the inflorescence is called a raceme (as opposed to a panicle for multi-flowered bunches). The flowers are reported to give off a strong sugary smell and are brownish-yellow in colour. Sepals are elliptic to oblong and ≤8 mm long. Like all Nepenthes species, N. rajah is dioecious, which means that individual plants produce flowers of a single sex. Fruits are orange-brown and 10 to 20 mm long (see image). A study of 300 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (J.H.Adam 2443, collected at an altitude of 1930–2320 m) found the mean pollen diameter to be 34.7 μm (SE = 0.3; CV = 7.0%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1–7. Other characteristics The root system of N. rajah is notably extensive, although it is relatively shallow as in most Nepenthes species. All parts of the plant are covered in long, white hairs when young, but mature plants are virtually glabrous (lacking hair). This covering of hair is known as the indumentum. The colour of herbarium specimens is dark-brown in varying hues (see image). Little variation has been observed within natural populations of Nepenthes rajah and, consequently, no forms or varieties have been described. Furthermore, N. rajah has no true nomenclatural synonyms,Clarke 1997, p. 120. unlike many other Nepenthes species, which exhibit greater variability. Carnivory Drowned lizard found in a freshly opened pitcher. The animal was pulled out of the digestive zone for the photograph. Nepenthes rajah is a carnivorous plant of the pitfall trap variety. It is famous for occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah. In 2011, the discovery of a drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N. rajah pitcher was reported. Nepenthes rajah is also known to occasionally trap other small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals, or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher, and certainly do not represent the norm.Clarke 1997, p. 33. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Other arthropods, such as centipedes, also fall prey to N. rajah. Nepenthes rafflesiana is one of the few other Nepenthes species reliably documented as having caught mammalian prey in its natural habitat. In Brunei, frogs, geckos and skinks have been found in the pitchers of this species.Moran 1991. The remains of mice have also been reported.\\"I once found a perfect mouse skeleton in a pitcher of N. rafflesiana\\" -- Ch'ien Lee On September 29, 2006, at the Jardin botanique de Lyon in France, a cultivated N. truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse.[Anonymous] 2006. Rattus baluensis feeding on nectar from a pitcher of N. rajah Mutualism with mammals Nepenthes rajah has evolved a mutualistic relationship with mountain treeshrews (Tupaia montana) in order to collect their droppings. The inside of the reflexed lid exudes a sweet nectar. The distance from the pitcher mouth to the exudate is the same as the average body length of the mountain treeshrew. These proportions also hold true for N. lowii and N. macrophylla. As it feeds, the treeshrew defecates, apparently as a method of marking its feeding territory. It is thought that in exchange for providing nectar, the faeces provide N. rajah with the majority of the nitrogen it requires.Chin, L., J.A. Moran & C. Clarke 2010.

David Attenborough's life lessons. BBC Nature Features, November 15, 2012. In N. lowii, N. macrophylla and N. rajah, the colour of the lower lid surface corresponds to visual sensitivity maxima of the mountain treeshrew in the green and blue wavebands, making the lid underside stand out against adjacent parts of the pitcher.Moran, J.A., C. Clarke, M. Greenwood & L. Chin 2012. Tuning of color contrast signals to visual sensitivity maxima of tree shrews by three Bornean highland Nepenthes species. Plant Signaling & Behavior 7(10): 1267–1270. Of the three species, N. rajah shows the tightest 'fit', particularly in the green waveband. In 2011, it was reported that N. rajah has a similar mutualistic relationship with the summit rat (Rattus baluensis).Wells, K., M.B. Lakim, S. Schulz & M. Ayasse 2011. Pitchers of Nepenthes rajah collect faecal droppings from both diurnal and nocturnal small mammals and emit fruity odour. Journal of Tropical Ecology 27(4): 347–353. Greenwood, M., C. Clarke, C.C. Lee, A. Gunsalam & R.H. Clarke 2011. A unique resource mutualism between the giant Bornean pitcher plant, Nepenthes rajah, and members of a small mammal community. PLoS ONE 6(6): e21114. Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers during daylight hours, the summit rat is primarily active at night; this may be an example of resource partitioning. Daily scat deposition rates were found to be similar for both mammalian species. Other interactions with animals=Pitcher infauna Culex rajah (left) and Toxorhynchites rajah (right) Although Nepenthes are most famous for trapping and digesting animals, their pitchers also play host to a large number of other organisms (known as infauna). These include fly and midge larvae, spiders (most notably the crab spider Misumenops nepenthicola), mites, ants, and even a species of crab, Geosesarma malayanum. The most common and conspicuous predators found in pitchers are mosquito larvae, which consume large numbers of other larvae during their development. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts.Beaver 1979, pp. 1–10. The complex relationships between these various organisms are not yet fully understood. The question of whether infaunal animals \\"steal\\" food from their hosts, or whether they are involved in a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association has yet to be investigated experimentally and is the source of considerable debate. Clarke suggests that mutualism is a \\"likely situation\\", whereby \\"the infauna receives domicile, protection and food from the plant, while in return, the infauna helps to break down the prey, increase the rate of digestion and keep bacterial numbers low\\".Clarke 1997, pp. 42–43. Species specific As the size and shape of Nepenthes pitchers vary greatly between species, but little within a given taxon, it is not surprising that many infaunal organisms are specially adapted to life in only the traps of particular species. N. rajah is no exception, and in fact has two mosquito taxa named after it. Culex (Culiciomyia) rajah and Toxorhynchites (Toxorhynchites) rajah were described by Masuhisa Tsukamoto in 1989, based on larvae collected in pitchers of N. rajah on Mount Kinabalu three years earlier.Tsukamoto 1989, p. 216. The two species were found to live in association with larvae of Culex (Lophoceraomyia) jenseni, Uranotaenia (Pseudoficalbia) moultoni and an undescribed taxon, Tripteroides (Rachionotomyia) sp. No. 2. Concerning C. rajah, Tsukamoto noted that the \\"body surface of most larvae are covered in Vorticella-like protozoa\\".Tsukamoto 1989, p. 220. At present, nothing is known of this species with regards to its adult biology, habitat, or medical importance as a vector of diseases. The same is true for T. rajah; nothing is known of its biology except that adults are not haematophagous. Damage caused by pests Another species, Culex shebbearei, has also been recorded as an infaunal organism of N. rajah in the past. The original 1931 record by F. W. EdwardsEdwards 1931, pp. 25–28. is based on a collection by H. M. Pendlebury in 1929 from a plant growing on Mount Kinabalu. However, Tsukamoto notes that in light of new information on these species, \\"it seems more likely to conclude that the species [C. rajah] is a new species which has been misidentitied as C. shebbearei for a long time, rather than to think that both C. shebbearei and C. rajah n. sp. are living in pitchers of Nepenthes rajah on Mt. Kinabalu\\". Pests Not all interactions between Nepenthes and fauna are beneficial to the plant. Nepenthes rajah is sometimes attacked by insects which feed on its leaves and damage substantial portions of the lamina. Also, monkeys and tarsiers are known to occasionally rip pitchers open to feed on their contents.Burbidge 1880. History and popularity Hugh Low Due to its size, unusual morphology and striking colouration, N. rajah has always been a very popular and highly sought-after insectivorous plant. However, despite its popularity amongst pitcher plant enthusiasts, N. rajah remains a little-known species outside the field of carnivorous plants. Due to its specialised growing requirements, it is not a suitable candidate for a houseplant and, as such, is only cultivated by a relatively small number of hobbyists and professional growers worldwide. This being the case, N. rajah is nonetheless probably the most famous of all pitcher plants. Its reputation for producing some of the most magnificent pitchers in the genus dates back to the late 19th century.Masters, M.T. 1872. The cultivated species of Nepenthes. The Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette 1872(16): 540–542. Nepenthes rajah was first collected by Hugh Low on Mount Kinabalu in 1858. It was described the following year by Joseph Dalton Hooker, who named it after James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The description was published in The Transactions of the Linnean Society of London: > Nepenthes Rajah, H. f. (Frutex, 4-pedalis, Low). Foliis maximis 2-pedalibus, > oblongo-lanceolatis petiolo costaque crassissimis, ascidiis giganteis (cum > operculo l-2-pedalibus) ampullaceis ore contracto, stipite folio peltatim > affixo, annulo maximo lato everso crebre lamellato, operculo amplissimo > ovato-cordato, ascidium totum æquante.—(Tab.

One of the earliest known illustrations of N. rajah, published in Life in the Forests of the Far East in 1862. Spenser St. John wrote the following account of his encounter with N. rajah on Mount Kinabalu in Life in the Forests of the Far East published in 1862:St. John 1862, pp. 324, 334. > Another steep climb of 800 feet brought us to the Marei Parei spur, to the > spot where the ground was covered with the magnificent pitcher-plants, of > which we had come in search.

Illustration of the first N. rajah plant to be cultivated in Europe, published in The Garden, 1882. Nepenthes rajah was first collected for the Veitch Nurseries by Frederick William Burbidge in 1878, during his second trip to Borneo.Phillipps & Lamb 1996, p. 20. Shortly after being introduced into cultivation in 1881, N. rajah proved very popular among wealthy Victorian horticulturalists and became a much sought-after species. A note in The Gardeners' Chronicle of 1881 mentions the Veitch plant as follows: \\"N. rajah at present is only a young Rajah, what it will become was lately illustrated in our columns...\\".[Anonymous] 1881. A year later, young N. rajah plants were displayed at the Royal Horticultural Society's annual show for the first time.Phillipps & Lamb 1996, p. 22. The specimen exhibited at the show by the Veitch Nurseries, the first of this species to be cultivated in Europe, won a first class certificate.Phillipps & Lamb 1996, p. 21. In Veitch's catalogue for 1889, N. rajah was priced at £2.2s per plant.Phillipps & Lamb 1996, p. 18. During this time, interest in Nepenthes had reached its peak. The Garden reported that Nepenthes were being propagated by the thousands to keep up with European demand. However, dwindling interest in Nepenthes at the turn of the century saw the demise of the Veitch Nurseries and consequently the loss of several species and hybrids in cultivation, including N. northiana and N. rajah. By 1905, the final N. rajah specimens from the Veitch nurseries were gone, as the cultural requirements of the plants proved too difficult to reproduce. The last surviving N. rajah in cultivation at this time was located at the National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin in Ireland, however this soon perished also. It would be many years before N. rajah was reintroduced into cultivation. Recent popularity A memorial stained glass window in St Leonard's Church, Sheepstor, Devon, England, dedicated to those from Sarawak who died in World War II. It depicts a pair of pitcher plants, which the church guide describes as \\"a typical native pitcher plant - Naperthes Rajah\\", although they appear to be N. edwardsiana In recent years there has been renewed interest in Nepenthes worldwide. Much of the plants' current popularity can probably be attributed to Shigeo Kurata, whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (1976), which featured the best colour photography of Nepenthes to date, did much to bring attention to these unusual plants. Not surprisingly, N. rajah is a relatively well known plant in Malaysia, especially its native Sabah. The species is often used to promote Sabah, and specifically Kinabalu National Park, as a tourist destination, and features prominently on postcards from the region. Nepenthes rajah has appeared on the covers of several popular Nepenthes publications, including Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (Kurata, 1976) and Nepenthes of Borneo (Clarke, 1997), both published in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. On April 6, 1996, Malaysia issued a series of four postage stamps depicting some of its more famous Nepenthes species. Two 30¢ stamps, featuring N. macfarlanei and N. sanguinea, as well as two 50¢ stamps, depicting N. lowii and N. rajah, were released.Ellis 2000. The N. rajah stamp has been assigned a unique identification number in two popular stamp numbering systems: Scott #580 and Yvert #600. Curiously, the peltate leaf attachment that is so characteristic of this species is not shown. Nepenthes rajah was featured in the first episode of Kingdom of Plants 3D, a natural history documentary series presented by David Attenborough.Kingdom of Plants: Episode 1 - Life in the Wet Zone.

Note: it is now known that N. maxima is absent from Borneo. } Nepenthes rajah is not generally considered to be closely related to any other species, due to its unusual pitcher and leaf morphology. However, several attempts have been made to deduce natural groupings within the genus Nepenthes, which have grouped N. rajah with other species thought to share certain traits with it. The Nepenthes were first split up in 1873, when Hooker published his monograph on the genus, titled \\"Nepenthaceae\\". Hooker distinguished N. pervillei from all other taxa based on its seeds, which lack the appendages typical of most Nepenthes. He placed it in the monotypic subgenus Anourosperma. All other species were subsumed in the second subgenus, Eunepenthes. A second attempt to establish a natural subdivision within the genus was made in 1895 by Günther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau in \\"Die Gattung Nepenthes\\".Beck, G. 1895. Beck kept the two subgenera created by Hooker, but divided Eunepenthes into three subgroups: Retiferae, Apruinosae and Pruinosae. Nepenthes rajah formed part of the Apruinosae (Latin: pl. of apruinosa: not frosted). Nepenthes taxonomy was once again revised in 1908 by John Muirhead Macfarlane in his own monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\".Macfarlane 1908, pp. 1–91. Oddly, Macfarlane did not name the groups he distinguished. His revision is not generally considered to be a natural division of the genus. In 1928, B. H. Danser published his seminal monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", in which he divided Nepenthes into six clades, based on observations of herbarium material.Clarke 2001a, pp. 81–82. The clades were: the Vulgatae, Montanae, Nobiles, Regiae, Insignes and Urceolatae. Danser placed N. rajah in the Regiae (Latin: pl. of rēgia: royal). The Regiae clade as proposed by Danser is shown in the adjacent table. Most of the species in this clade are large plants with petiolate leaves, an indumentum of coarse reddish-brown hairs, raceme-like inflorescence, and funnel-shaped (infundibulate) upper pitchers. All bear a characteristic appendage on the lower surface of the lid near the apex. With the exception of N. lowii, the Regiae all have a mostly flattened or expanded peristome. The majority of species comprising Regiae are endemic to Borneo. Based on current understanding of the genus, Regiae appears to reflect the relationships of its members quite well, although the same cannot be said for the other clades.Clarke 2001a, p. 82. Despite this, Danser's classification was undoubtedly a great improvement on previous attempts. The taxonomical work of Danser (1928) was revised by Hermann Harms in 1936. Harms divided Nepenthes into three subgenera: Anurosperma Hooker.f. (1873), Eunepenthes Hooker.f. (1873) and Mesonepenthes Harms (1936) (Latin: meso: middle; \\"middle\\" Nepenthes). The Nepenthes species found in the subgenera Anurosperma and Mesonepenthes differ from those in the Vulgatae, where Danser had placed them. Harms included N. rajah in the subgenus Eunepenthes together with the great majority of other Nepenthes; Anurosperma was a monotypic subgenus, while Mesonepenthes contained only three species. He also created an additional clade, the Distillatoriae (after N. distillatoria). In his 1976 book, Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu, Shigeo Kurata presented detailed photographs of lid nectar glands and the digestive glands of the trap interior. He divided the latter into the \\"lower\\", \\"upper\\" and \\"middle\\" parts. { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; width: 450px; border: 1px #bbbbbb solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 85%;\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=limegreen  colspan=\\"10\\"  Distribution of phenolic compounds and leucoanthocyanins in N. × alisaputrana, N. burbidgeae and N. rajah - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=lightgreen  Taxon 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  Specimen - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. × alisaputrana+++3+3++++3++J2442 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff in vitro+++3+3++++++ - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. burbidgeae3+++3+3+-+--J2484 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. rajah--+±++++3++J2443 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=lightgreen  colspan=\\"10\\"  Key: 1: Phenolic acid, 2: Ellagic acid, 3: Quercetin, 4: Kaempferol, 5: Luteolin, 6: 'Unknown Flavonoid 1', 7: 'Unknown Flavonoid 3', 8: Cyanidin ±: very weak spot, +: weak spot, ++: strong spot, 3+: very strong spot, -: absent, J = Jumaat Source: } Biochemical analysis More recently, biochemical analysis has been used as a means to determine cladistical relationships between Nepenthes species. In 1975, David E. Fairbrothers et al.Fairbrothers, Mabry, Scogin & Turner 1975. first suggested a link between chemical properties and certain morphological groupings, based on the theory that morphologically similar plants produce chemical constituents with similar therapeutic effects. In 2002, phytochemical screening and analytical chromatography were used to study the presence of phenolic compounds and leucoanthocyanins in several naturally occurring hybrids and their putative parental species (including N. rajah) from Sabah and Sarawak. The research was based on leaf material from nine dry herbarium specimens. Eight spots containing phenolic acids, flavonols, flavones, leucoanthocyanins and 'unknown flavonoid' 1 and 3 were identified from chromatographic profiles. The distributions of these in the hybrid N. × alisaputrana and its putative parental species N. rajah and N. burbidgeae are shown in the adjacent table. A specimen of N. × alisaputrana grown from tissue culture (in vitro) was also tested. Phenolic and ellagic acids were undetected in N. rajah, while concentrations of kaempferol were found to be very weak. Chromatographic patterns of the N. × alisaputrana samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species. Myricetin was found to be absent from all studied taxa. This agrees with the findings of previous authors (R. M. Som in 1988; M. Jay and P. Lebreton in 1972)Som 1988.Jay & Lebreton 1972, pp. 607–613. and suggests that the absence of a widely distributed compound like myricetin among the Nepenthes examined might provide \\"additional diagnostic information for these six species\\". Several proteins and nucleotides of N. rajah have been either partially or completely sequenced. These are as follows: * translocated tRNA-Lys (trnK) pseudogene (DQ007139)Meimberg et al. 2006 * trnK gene & maturase K (matK) gene (AF315879)Meimberg et al. 2001 * trnK gene & maturase K (matK) gene (AF315880) * maturase K (AAK56010) * maturase K (AAK56011) Related species In 1998, a striking new species of Nepenthes was discovered in the Philippines by Andreas Wistuba. Temporarily dubbed N. sp. Palawan 1, it bears a close resemblance to N. rajah in terms of pitcher and leaf morphology. In 2007, the species was described by Wistuba and Joachim Nerz as N. mantalingajanensis.Nerz & Wistuba 2007. Ecology=Kinabalu Mount Kinabalu, Borneo Nepenthes rajah has a very localised distribution, being restricted to Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon, both located in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.Clarke 1997, p. 123. Mount Kinabalu is a massive granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic batholith. At 4095.2 m, it is by far the tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area's rarest species can be found here. Ultramafic outcrops (yellow) in Kinabalu National Park (green) Substrate Nepenthes rajah seems to grow exclusively on serpentine soils containing high concentrations of nickel and chromium, which are toxic to many plant species. Its tolerance of these, therefore, means that it can grow in an ecological niche where it faces less competition for space and nutrients.Adlassnig, Peroutka, Lambers & Lichtscheidl 2005. The root systems of N. × alisaputranaClarke 2001b. and N. villosaKaul 1982. are also known to be resistant to the heavy metals present in serpentine substrates. These soils are also rich in magnesium and are slightly alkaline as a result. They often form a relatively thin layer over a base of ultramafic rock and are thus known as ultramafic soils. Ultramafic soils are thought to cover approximately 16% of Kinabalu National Park. These soils have high levels of endemicity in many taxonomic groups, not least the Nepenthes. Four species in the genus, including N. rajah, can only be found within the boundaries of the park. Temperature and humidity readings taken along the \\"Nepenthes rajah Nature Trail\\" (~2000 m a.s.l.) at around 10 am during an overcast sky Nepenthes rajah usually grows in open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, particularly in areas of seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges. Climate Nepenthes rajah has an altitudinal distribution of 1500–2650 m a.s.l. and is thus considered an (ultra) highland or Upper Montane plant. In the upper limit of its range, night-time temperatures may approach freezing and day-time maxima rarely exceed 25 ℃.Clarke 1997, p. 2. Due to the night-time temperature drop, relative air humidity increases significantly, rising from 65–75% to over 95%. Vegetation at this height is very stunted and slow-growing due to the extreme environmental conditions that prevail. Plants are often subjected to fierce winds and driving rain, as well as exposure to intense direct sunlight. The relatively open vegetation of the upper montane forest also experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity compared with lower altitudes. These changes are largely governed by the extent of cloud cover. In the absence of clouds, temperatures rise rapidly, humidity drops, and light levels may be very high. When cloud cover returns, temperatures and light levels fall, while humidity levels increase.Clarke 1997, p. 29. Average annual precipitation in this region is around 3000 mm. Conservation status=Endangered species Distribution within Kinabalu National Park Nepenthes rajah is classified as Endangered (EN – B1+2e) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is also listed on Schedule I, Part II of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment (WCE) 1997Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and CITES Appendix I, which prohibits international trade in plants collected from the wild. However, due to its popularity among collectors, many plants have been removed from the wild illegally,Creek, M. 1990. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 19(3–4): 109–112. even though the species' distribution lies entirely within the bounds of Kinabalu Park. This led to some populations being severely depleted by over-collection in the 1970s and eventually resulted in the species' inclusion in CITES Appendix I in 1981.Clarke 2001b, p. 29. Together with N. khasiana, it is one of only two species in the genus to feature on this list; all other Nepenthes species are covered by Appendix II. This being the case, however, the short-term future of N. rajah seems to be relatively secure and it would perhaps be more accurately classified as Vulnerable (VU) or, taking into account protected populations in National Parks, Lower Risk conservation dependent (LR (cd)).Clarke 1997, pp. 170–172. This agrees with the conservation status of N. rajah according to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC), under which it is also considered Vulnerable. Furthermore, the species was originally treated as Vulnerable (V) by the IUCN prior to the introduction of the 1994 threat categories. Although N. rajah has a restricted distribution and is often quoted as a plant in peril,Simpson 1991. it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape making it difficult to illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official should be able to identify it. The recent advent of artificial tissue culture, or more specifically in vitro, technology in Europe and the United States has meant that plants can be produced in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices (~US$20–$30 in the case of N. rajah). In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.Clarke 1997, p. 172. Rob Cantley, a prominent conservationist and artificial propagator of Nepenthes plants, assesses the current status of plants in the wild as follows: > This species grows in at least 2 distinct sub-populations, both of which are > well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations > grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without > permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature > individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due > to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised > collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in > recent years as a result of the availability of inexpensive clones from > tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this > species from the wild is negligible. This being the case, however, it appears that the genetic variability of cultivated N. rajah plants is very small, as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants are thought to belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England. However, illegal collection is not the only threat facing plants in the wild. The El Niño climatic phenomenon of 1997/98 had a catastrophic effect on the Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu.Clarke 2001a, p. 236. The dry period that followed severely depleted some natural populations. Forest fires broke out in 9 locations in Kinabalu Park, covering a total area of 25 square kilometres and generating large amounts of smog. During the El Niño period, many plants were temporarily transferred to the park nursery to save at least some individuals. These were later replanted in the \\"Nepenthes Garden\\" in Mesilau (see below). In spite of this, N. rajah was one of the less affected species and relatively few plants perished as a result. Since then, Ansow Gunsalam has established a nursery close to the Mesilau Lodge at the base of Kinabalu Park to protect the endangered species of that area, including N. rajah. Plant on display at the Kinabalu \\"Mountain Garden\\" Restricted distribution The newly opened Mesilau Nature Resort, which lies near the golf course behind the village of Kundasang, is now the only place where regular visitors can hope to see this species in its natural habitat.Clarke 2001b, p. 38. Here, several dozen N. rajah plants grow near the top of a steep landslide. Both young and mature plants are present, some with sizable pitchers that may occasionally exceed 40 cm in height (see image). Daily guided tours are organised to the \\"Nepenthes Garden\\" where these plants are located. The \\"Nepenthes rajah Nature Trail\\" is subject to a fee and operates daily from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm. Almost all other natural populations of this species occur in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park, which are off-limits to tourists. Visitors to the park can also see N. rajah on display in the nursery adjoining the \\"Mountain Garden\\" at Kinabalu Park Headquarters.Malouf 1995, p. 68. Other known localities of wild N. rajah populations include the Marai Parai plateau, Mesilau East River near Mesilau Cave, the Upper Kolopis River, and the eastern slope of Mount Tambuyukon.Kurata 1976, p. 64–65. On Pig Hill, N. rajah grows at 1950–2320 mAdam, J.H., C.C. Wilcock & M.D. Swaine 1992. Journal of Tropical Forest Science 5(1): 13–25. and is sympatric with N. burbidgeae, N. tentaculata, and the natural hybrid N. × alisaputrana.Thong, J. 2006. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Journal 82: 6–12. Natural hybrids N. rajah × N. tentaculata N. rajah × N. stenophylla Nepenthes rajah is known to hybridise with several other species with which it is sympatric. It seems to flower at any time of year and for this reason it hybridises relatively easily. Charles Clarke also notes that \\"N. rajah, more than any other species, appears to have been successful in having its pollen transported over considerable distances. Consequently, a number of putative N. rajah hybrids exist without the parent plant growing nearby\\". However, it appears that the limit as to how far pollen can be transported is approximately 10 km.Clarke 1997, p. 143. Hybrids between N. rajah and all other Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu have been recorded.A rare find: N. rajah nat. hybrid. Flora Nepenthaceae. Due to the slow-growing nature of N. rajah, few hybrids involving it have been artificially produced yet.[Anonymous] 2012. Nepenthes Growers Newsletter 1(2): 2. At present, the following natural hybrids are known: * N. burbidgeae × N. rajah [=N. × alisaputrana J.H.Adam & Wilcock (1992)] * N. edwardsiana × N. rajah * N. fusca × N. rajah * N. lowii × N. rajah * N. macrovulgaris × N. rajah * N. rajah × N. stenophylla * N. rajah × N. tentaculata * N. rajah × N. villosa [=N. × kinabaluensis Sh.Kurata (1976) nom.nud.] The \\"Mountain Garden\\" of Kinabalu National Park contains a number of well-grown Nepenthes, including the rare hybrid N. rajah × N. stenophylla. This plant has leaves resembling those of N. stenophylla, but the lid and wings are typical of N. rajah. The peristome is strongly influenced by N. stenophylla and bristles are present at the border of the lid, a unique characteristic of this hybrid.Steiner 2002, p. 124. It occurs at an altitude of 1500–2600 m. A single example of N. lowii × N. rajah grows along the Mesilau nature trail.Thong, J. 2006. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Journal 81: 12–17. Two hybrids of N. rajah have been formally described and given specific names: N. × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis. Both are listed on CITES Appendix II and the latter is also considered Endangered (EN (D)) under current IUCN criteria.Arx, Schlauer & Groves 2001, p. 44. Nepenthes × alisaputrana Nepenthes × alisaputrana Nepenthes × alisaputrana (originally published as \\"Nepenthes × alisaputraiana\\")Adam & Wilcock 1992. is named in honour of Datuk Lamri Ali, Director of Sabah Parks. It is only known from a few remote localities within Kinabalu National Park where is grows in stunted, open vegetation over serpentine soils at around 2000 m above sea level, often amongst populations of N. burbidgeae. This plant is notable for combining the best characters of both parent species, not least the size of its pitchers, which rival those of N. rajah in volume (≤35 cm high, ≤20 cm wide).Clarke 2001b, p. 10. The other hybrids involving N. rajah do not exhibit such impressive proportions. The pitchers of N. × alisaputrana can be distinguished from those of N. burbidgeae by a broader peristome, larger lid and simply by their sheer size. The hybrid differs from its other parent, N. rajah, by its lid structure, indumentum of short, brown hairs, narrower and more cylindrical peristome, and pitcher colour, which is usually yellow-green with red or brown flecking. For this reason, Phillipps and Lamb (1996) gave it the common name Leopard pitcher- plant, though this is rarely used. The peristome is green to dark red and striped with purple bands. Leaves are often slightly peltate. The plant climbs well and aerial pitchers are frequently produced. N. × alisaputrana more closely resembles N. rajah than N. burbidgeae, but it is difficult to confuse this plant with either. However, this mistake has previously been made on at least one occasion; a pitcher illustrated in Insect Eating Plants & How To Grow Them (Slack, 1986) as being N. rajah was in fact N. burbidgeae × N. rajah.Clarke 1997, p. 157.Slack 1986. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis Nepenthes × kinabaluensis Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is another impressive plant. The pitchers get large also, but do not compare to those of N. rajah or N. × alisaputrana. It is a well-known natural hybrid of what many consider to be the two most spectacular Nepenthes species of Borneo: N. rajah and N. villosa. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is only found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species are occur sympatrically.Clarke 1997, pp. 165–167. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a southeast ridge, which lies on the west side of the Upper Kolopis River.Kurata 1976, p. 65. The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between Layang-Layang and the helipad, where it grows at about 2900 m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030 m.Steiner 2002, p. 112. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. This hybrid can be distinguished from N. rajah by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and are clue as to the hybrid's parentage (N. villosa has highly developed peristome ribs). The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of N. rajah), the lid orbiculate or reniformed and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1–2 cm below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah.Clarke 2001b, p. 19. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. In all respects N. × kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was labelled as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World (Cheers, 1992).Cheers 1992. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis was first collected near Kambarangoh by Lilian Gibbs in 1910 and later mentioned by Macfarlane as \\"Nepenthes sp.\\" in 1914.Kurata 1976, p. 64. Although Macfarlane did not formally name the plant, he noted that \\"[a]ll available morphological details suggest that this is a hybrid between N. villosa and N. rajah\\".Macfarlane 1914, p. 127. The name N. × kinabaluensis was first published in Shigeo Kurata's 1976 book, Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu, but was a nomen nudum at the time as it lacked an adequate description and information on the type specimen. The name was subsequently published validly by Kurata in 1984.Kurata, S. 1984. Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society 35: 65. Hybrid or species? Lower pitchers of N. × kinabaluensis Nepenthes × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis are often fertile and thus may breed among themselves. Clive A. Stace writes that we may speak of \\"stabilised hybrids when they have developed a distributional, morphological or genetic set of characters which is no longer strictly related to that of its parents, ... if the hybrid has become an independent, recognisable, self-producing unit, it is de facto a separate species\\".Stace 1980. Nepenthes hurrelliana and N. murudensis are two examples of species that have a putative hybrid origin. Nepenthes × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis are sufficiently stabilised that a species status has been discussed. Indeed, N. kinabaluensis was described as a species by Adam & Wilcock in 1996. Due to their dioecious nature, a hybrid involving a pair of Nepenthes species can represent one of two possible crosses, depending on which species was the female and which was the male. When the cross is known, the female (or pod) parent is usually referred to first, followed by the male (or pollen) parent. This is an important distinction, as the hybrid will usually display different morphological features according to the type of cross; the pod parent is thought to be dominant in most cases and hybrid offspring usually resemble it more than the pollen parent. Most wild plants of N. × kinabaluensis, for example, show a greater affinity to N. rajah than N. villosa and are thus thought to represent the cross N. rajah × N. villosa. However, specimens have been found that seem to be more similar to N. villosa, suggesting that they might be the reverse cross (see ). The same is true for other hybrids involving N. rajah. Cultivation Nepenthes rajah has always been considered to be one of the more difficult Nepenthes species to cultivate. However, in recent years, it has become apparent that the plant may not be deserving of its reputation. Cultivated N. rajah plant with large lower pitcher Environmental factors Nepenthes rajah is a montane species or \\"highlander\\", growing at altitudes ranging from 1500 to 2650 m. As such, it requires warm days, with temperatures ranging (ideally) from approximately 25 to 30 ℃,On the Cultivation of Nepenthes rajah and cool nights, with temperatures of about 10 to 15 ℃. The temperatures themselves are not vital (when kept within reasonable limits), but rather the temperature drop itself; N. rajah needs considerably cooler nights, with a drop of 10 ℃ or more being preferable. Failure to observe this requirement will almost certainly doom the plant in the long term or, at best, limit it to being a small, unimpressive specimen. In addition, like all Nepenthes, this plant needs a fairly humid environment to grow well. Values in the region of 75% R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in conjunction with a humidistat. Cultivated N. rajah plant In its natural habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, where it is exposed to direct sunlight – it therefore needs to be provided with a significant amount of light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000 watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12 hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator. Potting and watering Pure long-fibre Sphagnum moss is an excellent potting medium, though combinations involving any of the following – peat, perlite, vermiculite, sand, lava rock, pumice, Osmunda fibre, orchid bark and horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant. It has been noted that N. rajah produces a very extensive root system (for a Nepenthes) and, for this reason, it is recommended that a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system. This also eliminates the need for frequent re-potting, which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant. Purified water should be used for watering purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100 p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal.D'Amato 1998, p. 7. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants should not be allowed to sit in water, as this may lead to root rot. Cultivated N. rajah pitcher Feeding and fertilising Nepenthes rajah is a carnivorous plant and, as such, supplements nutrients gained from the soil with captured prey (especially insects) to alleviate deficiencies in important elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Just as in nature, a cultivated plant's 'diet' may include insects and other prey items, although this is not necessary for successful cultivation. Crickets are recommended for their size and low cost. These can be purchased online or at specialist pet stores. They can simply be dropped into the pitchers by hand or placed inside using metal tongs or similar, whether dead or alive. From trials carried out by a commercial Nepenthes nursery, it appears that micronutrient solutions have \\"a beneficial effect on plants of improved leaf colouration, with no deleterious effects\\" as far as can be seen. However, more research is required to verify these results. Actual fertilisers (containing NPK) were, on the other hand, found to \\"cause damage to plants, promote pathogens and have no observable benefits\\". Hence, the use of chemical fertilisers is usually not advised. Nepenthes rajah is a slow growing Nepenthes. Under optimal conditions, N. rajah can reach flowering size within 10 years of seed germination. Common misconceptions N. rajah growing near a small waterfall Nepenthes rajah has been a well known and highly sought after species for over a century and, as a result, there are many stories woven around this plant. One such example is the famous legend that N. rajah grows exclusively in the spray zones of waterfalls, on ultramafic soils. Although the latter is true, N. rajah is certainly not found solely in the spray zones of waterfalls and this statement seems to have little basis in fact. It is likely this misconception was popularised by Shigeo Kurata's 1976 book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu, in which he states that \\"N. rajah is rather fond of wet places like swamps or the surroundings of a waterfall\\". This being the case, certain N. rajah plants do in fact grow in the vicinity of waterfalls (as noted by H. Steiner, 2002) \\"providing quite a humid microclimate\\", which may indeed be the source of this particular misconception. Another myth surrounding this species is that it occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted for a very long time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species.D'Amato 1998, XV. It is interesting to note that one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.

The series consists of 20 comic albums, as well as a number of shorter stories published in various magazines. In 2006 a short animated 3D movie was made. Since 2016 two books by new authors have been published, containing collections of short stories focusing mainly on secondary characters from Kajko and Kokosz series (Breakbone, Miluś, Knavenknights etc.). The first long Kajko and Kokosz story in almost 30 years \\"Królewska Konna\\" (\\"The Royal Mounties\\") was released in spring 2019 written by Maciej Kur (who did most of the previews short stories) and drawn by Sławomir Kiełbus, with colors by Piotr Bednarczyk. The plot was based on an unused idea by Christa himself, taken from his notes. The book met with massive positive reactions from the fans.https://kzet.pl/2019/05/kajko-i- kokosz-nowe-przygody-krolewska-konna-recenzja.html Plot Main characters in the series include castellan Mirmił, hypochondriac ruler of the village of Mirmiłowo, where Kajko and Kokosz serve as warriors; Lubawa, dominating wife of Mirmił; small dragon Miluś; benevolent witch Jaga; her husband, the good robber Breakbone (Lamignat) and the antagonists of the series: military knight order of Knaveknights (Zbójcerze), based on the Teutonic Knights, led by Hegemon, with his second in command, Hitler-like Corporal and Schweik-like Loser (Oferma ). The stories are written in a tongue-in-cheek manner and contain light satirical elements, usually puns concerning the reality of living in Communist-ruled Poland with characters sometimes mentioning labour unions, bureaucracy, commodity shortages, and similar themes. The characters * Kayko (Kajko) – A small but clever, brave and very resourceful warrior. He has a kind nature and always stands for justice. He lives with his best friend Kokosz. * Kokosh (Kokosz) – Best friend of Kajko. Almost the complete opposite of Kajko, he is large, fat and bald, and usually is shown to represent the worst habits – he always goes with his gut, appears to be self- centered and sometimes either aggressive or cowardly. He is however incredibly strong. In the first book, Kokosz is shown to believe that he is as strong as his shadow is long (depending on the time at that moment). * Mirmił – The castellan of Mirmiłowo, the village where Kajko and Kokosz live. He is a small man with a large red moustache. While good hearted, he occasionally appears to be pompous and melancholic – as a running gag, Mirmił often openly considers committing suicide whenever a problem appears to be unsolvable. * Lubawa – Mirmił's large and somehow more assertive wife. She often appears to be in control of her husband. * Jaga (known as Zielacha in Złoty puchar) — a good witch and also Kokosz's aunt, originally an ugly old hag who makes herself young-looking again through magic. Her name is a reference to Baba Jaga a witch from Polish fairy tales and folklore. She has a talking pet raven named \\"Gdaś\\". * Łamignat (Breakbone) – Jaga's husband. As a good natured and softhearted bandit who robs the rich and gives to the poor, some may believe this is a reference to Robin Hood, whereas Łamignat is in fact a parody of Robin Hood's Polish counterpart named Juraj Jánošík. He is incredibly strong, much stronger than Kokosz, and has a gigantic club which only he can lift. Łamignat's strength sometimes drives Kokosz furious with envy, yet they are still friends. Due to Łamignat's shy nature, Jaga encourages him by giving him a flute and telling him it will make Łamignat stronger whenever he plays it (the flute is in fact normal but gives a placebo effect to Łamignat, making him more confident). Łamignat's catch-phrase is \\"Lelum Polelum\\". * Miluś – A dragon that Kajko and Kokosz found (at first as an egg) and adopted in the book \\"Zamach na Milusia\\". Miluś appears to be afraid of small animals (mice for example) and only eats vegetables. In his second appearance in \\"Skarby Mirmiła\\" Miluś grew bigger and developed wings – he however could only fly if he could start and land on water – and in \\"Cudowny lek\\" Miluś met a female dragon and left Kajko and Kokosz to live in the land of dragons (which was actually a good thing, as there were many dragon hunters attempting to hunt him down). After that, Miluś appeared in some short stories (all collected in a special comic book \\"Urodziny Milusia\\") – all set before the events in \\"Cudowny lek\\". * Woj Wit (Wit the Warrior) – Kajko and Kokosz first meet Wit on their adventures in the second book \\"Szranki I konkury\\" and during their adventures in \\"Na wczasach\\". After the second one, however, Wit ends up living in Mirmiłowo and did not get to play an important part (apart from some background cameo appearances) until the very last book \\"Mirmił w Opałach\\". In the first book Wit is a romantic, adventure-seeking knight who only spoke in rhyme (he however lost the tendency to do so in the middle of the story as he got broken hearted). In his second appearance in \\"Na wczasach\\" Wit is shown as more of a Don Quixote figure, always looking for a challenge to a duel and often singing romantic songs (unlike his first appearance). In his third main appearance Wit was back to talking in rhyme and had become interested in science which led him to inventing exploding powder causing much more mayhem in the village. In his first two appearances Wit has a clever horse who was always trying to keep his master out of trouble. * The Knaveknights (Zbójcerze) – a group of evil knights wanting to take over Mirmiłowo loosely based on the Teutonic Knights. They are led by a powerful warrior Cruel Hegemon who is the main villain of the series. His right-hand man, a Hitler- like Kapral (Corporal) often appears to attempt to rebel. One more notable \\"Zbójcerz\\" is Oferma (Loser) who appears to be based on Schweik and while being the \\"idiot of the group\\" is often chosen for special missions. Reception The series was largely popular in Poland and has been reprinted several times. It was also the basis of several computer games, with the first one published in 1994. In the 2010s several albums were translated into other languages including Kashubian and Silesian, as well as a dialect used by highlanders from Podhale, as well as an English edition of two of the albums, Flying School and The big Tournament, translated by Michael Kandel. and French a translation by Pascale Peeters in 2018.[Artilcle about French books na- plasterki.blogspot.com/2018/03/kaiko-et-kokoche-en-vacances-i-nie-tylko.html] Asterix controversy For years fans accused the series of plagiarism, referencing its similarities to the series Asterix and vice versa. The titles share a similar art style, character designs and archetypes, and even employ similar jokes. While the main characters had debuted in Kajtek and Koko years before Asterix's first publication, the characters' incarnations as Slavic warriors Kajko and Kokosz post-dated Asterix's success (Kajtek and Koko plotline featured characters as modern-day sailors or space explorers). For years Christa maintained that the similarities were a coincidence, while Albert Uderzo (the Asterix creator) never addressed the matter. Some have described as significant the fact that the last \\"Kajko and Kokosz\\" book was published the same year as the first Polish translation of an Asterix book appeared. Albums in the series By Janusz Christa: * Złoty puchar (\\"The Golden Chalice\\") (3 parts) - also known as Złote prosię (\\"The Golden Pig\\") * Szranki i konkury (3 parts) (\\"The Tournaments\\") * Woje Mirmiła (3 parts) (\\"Mirmił's Warriors\\"); the 2nd part of a 2-part edition originally published as Rozprawa z Dajmiechem * Szkoła latania (\\"Flying School\\"); translated to Silesian as Szkoła furganio, and as Flying School in English. * Wielki turniej (\\"The Great Tournament\\"); translated to Goral dialect as Ogromniasto gońba, into English as \\"The Big Tournament\\" and into Ukraine as \\"Великий турнір\\". * Na wczasach (\\"On Holidays\\"); translated to Kashubian as Na latowisku and in French as \\"Kaïko et Kokoche en vacances\\". * Zamach na Milusia (\\"The Attempt on Miluś\\") * Skarby Mirmiła (\\"The Treasures of Mirmił) translated into Esperanto as \\"Kajko kaj Kokoŝo – Trezoroj de Mirmilo\\". * Cudowny lek (\\"The Miraculous Cure\\") * Festiwal czarownic (\\"The Witch Festival\\") translated to Goral dialect as \\"Posiady guślorek\\". * Dzień Śmiechały (\\"The Day of Laughter\\") * W krainie borostworów (\\"The Land of Forestlings\\") * Mirmił w opałach (\\"Mirmił in Trouble\\") * Urodziny Milusia (\\"The Birthday of Miluś\\") - this book is a set of short stories some set before events in \\"Cudowny lek\\". By other authors since: * Obłęd Hegemona (\\"Insanity of Hegemon\\") * Łamignat Straszliwy (\\"Breakbone the Terrible\\") * Królewska Konna (\\"The Royal Mounties\\") Video games The first version of the debut title (Kajko i Kokosz) appeared on Amiga computers; a short time later a PC version was released, published under the title Kajko i Kokosz w krainie borostworów. The author of the Kajko and Kokosz comics, Janusz Christa, took part in the creation of the first game, creating storyboards. In mid-2000s, two simple platform games (Szkoła Latania and Cudowny Lek) were published, aimed at kids, and in 2012, a new adventure game was released, composed of three stand-alone titles (Rozprawa z Hodonem, Podstęp Kaprala, and Mirmiłowo Wielkie) later combined into a complete edition (Twierdza Czarnoksiężnika). The following video games have been published: * Kajko i Kokosz w Krainie Borostworów (Amiga 1994, PC DOS 1995, PC Windows 1998) * Kajko i Kokosz: Szkoła Latania (2005) * Kajko i Kokosz 2: Cudowny Lek (2006) * Kajko i Kokosz: Rozprawa z Hodonem (2012) * Kajko i Kokosz: Podstęp Kaprala (2012) * Kajko i Kokosz: Mirmiłowo Wielkie (2012) * Kajko i Kokosz: Twierdza Czarnoksiężnika (2012) In 2019 the bandit Breakbone was added to the indie Go All Out video game.

Labelflash (sometimes written LabelFlash) is a technology which allows users to burn custom designs or images onto proprietary DVD media first announced in October 2005 as a collaboration between Yamaha and Fujifilm. While Yamaha developed the optical drives, Fujifilm manufactured the proprietary Labelflash optical discs.\\"YAMAHA, FUJIFILM DEVELOP LASER TECHNOLOGY TO ILLUSTRATE DVD.\\" AsiaPulse News, 20 Oct. 2005. General OneFile. Accessed 12 Nov. 2018. NEC manufactured the first Labelflash compatible drive, the ND4551, which was released in December 2005. Burning Labelflash media is supported by Nero Burning ROM version 7 and newer.7.0.2.8 Yamaha partnered with Toshiba and Gateway to provide Labelflash as a feature in computers made by those companies. Production of Labelflash media was halted on December 22, 2016. Labelflash was officially discontinued in 2017.  Technical details  In Labelflash, the standard recording head of an optical drive is repurposed to burn images onto a layer of dye made for this purpose on the top of proprietary Labelflash optical media. The dye is 0.6mm below the surface so as to protect it from the elements. The resolution is adjustable between 300 and 1800 dpi (dots per inch). Up to 256 monochromatic shades can be used in the image.\\"Integrator Trade Only - Hardware - DVD rewriter - NEC ND4551. Fast DVD rewriter with built-in label writer.

The labeling process takes 7 minutes at the lowest resolution and a half hour at the highest. Labelflash is backwards compatible with Yamaha's earlier DiscT@2 technology—this allows Labelflash-compatible optical drives to engrave onto the data side of discs as well. According to Yamaha, a new iteration of Labelflash which supported four color printing was in the works—however, as Labelflash support was discontinued in 2017, this never came to fruition.  Reception  The technology is often compared with Hewlett-Packard's LightScribe, released one year earlier. After its release, Labelflash was not available in the United States until 2007,\\"Fujifilm Rolls Out Labelflash DVD Media to U.S. Market\\" Wireless News, 13 June 2007. General OneFile. Accessed 12 Nov. 2018. giving HP a three year head start in the US market. Furthermore, worldwide, proprietary Labelflash optical media costed double that of comparable LightScribe media, at US$2.40 per disc, which Tom's Hardware called an \\"exorbitant\\" price that made printing \\"painful\\" as test prints were not worth doing. Commenting on the price, Engadget's Marc Perton said he'd \\"stick with [his] Sharpie for now.\\" Reviewers, such as Gordon Laing for Personal Computer World, also noted that when compared to LightScribe, Labelflash images looked more \\"unnatural\\" and less \\"vibrant\\".

A profile in 2010 by Australian author and Herald columnist Malcolm Knox said that Gonski is \\"a quiet man, in some ways invisible, and cleaves to the shadows. If he were to draw a self- portrait, Gonski would get more use out of an eraser than a pencil.\\" Early life and education Gonski was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and his family migrated to Australia in 1961 in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre. Gonski's father, Alexander, was a neurosurgeon of Polish background and a founding member of the New South Wales Golf Club at La Perouse. His mother is Helene Blume. In a 2010 interview, Gonski recalls that one of his earliest recollections was his mother buying a lithograph by Australian artist, Charles Blackman; commenting that \\"there's no doubt that my love for Australian art came from her.\\" Gonski is Jewish.http://www.smh.com.au/business/david-gonski-- the-man-behind-the- power-20120313-1uxw3.htmlhttp://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend- australian-magazine/david-gonski-the-centre-for-social-impact-and-the-art-of- giving-back/news-story/e82eedaf9dbfd8a69d1e70f2c161a63d He attended Sydney Grammar School and the University of New South Wales, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1976 and a Bachelor of Laws degree (with the University Medal) in 1977.

Gonski Reports In April 2010, Gonski was commissioned by Julia Gillard, then Minister for Education in the Rudd Government, to be chairman of a committee to make recommendations regarding funding of education in Australia. The findings and recommendations of the committee were presented to the government in November 2011, whereafter deliberations were entered into by the federal and state governments to consider its content. The committee's report is known as the Gonski Report. Subsequently, the proposed reforms (an increase in funding) became known as \\"Gonski\\" and supporters urged governments to \\"Give a Gonski\\". The report was removed from the website by the incoming government after the 2013 federal election and is preserved by Australia's Pandora Archive. In 2017, Gonski chaired an independent panel, the Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools, commissioned to examine evidence and make recommendations on how school funding should be used to improve school performance and student outcomes.

Underway 16 November, the ship cruised along the northern coast of South America until returning to Pensacola, Florida, 25 January 1844. She began a second cruise on 5 February, visiting Havana, Cuba, before proceeding north to Hampton Roads 8 March for repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard. As tensions escalated in the Gulf of Mexico, The USS Lawrence, Captain Samuel Mercer commanding, sailed south to join the Home Squadron on 14 June. She spent the next year cruising along the Gulf Coast, providing security to American shipping in the region and helping suppress piracy. After war broke out following a clash of arms in Texas on 25 April 1846, Lawrence cruised on a blockade station off the Mexican coast, remaining there until 17 June. In the interim, the brig landed sailors to help protect Point Isabel on 31 April. Lawrence's usefulness was limited by a deep draught that limited her to deeper water, as well as limited cargo space, and the brig was ordered to New York City, arriving there via Pensacola on 3 September. The brig decommissioned at New York on 12 September 1846 and was sold at Boston, Massachusetts later in the year.

Fairweather was born in Rothesay, New Brunswick, the son of J.H.A.L. Fairweather and Agnes C. McKeen. Fairweather was educated at Rothesay Collegiate. He served in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II from 1941 to 1945, retiring with the rank of lieutenant commander. He then obtained a Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of New Brunswick in 1949 and went on to earn his doctorate at Osgoode Hall. He was called to the bar in 1949 and entered the practice of law in Saint John. In 1958, he was named Queen's Counsel. In 1946, he married Nancy Elizabeth Broughall. They had two sons, Michael and Hugh, and a daughter, Wendy. From 1952 to 1962, he represented King's County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and from 1958 to 1960 he was the Attorney General. In 1962, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative candidate for the New Brunswick riding of Royal. He was re-elected in 1963, 1965, 1968, 1972, and 1974. From 1977 to 1987, he was appointed the first chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. From 1989 to 1992, he was founding chairman of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. He was an official observer of elections in Zimbabwe, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Malaysia and headed the Canadian delegation at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on three occasions. He received honorary doctoral degrees from several universities, the Outstanding Achievement Award of the Public Service in 1990, the 1997 Tarnopolsky Award for fostering human rights, the 1999 Canadian Red Cross (New Brunswick Branch) Humanitarian of the Year Award, and the 2002 New Brunswick Pioneer of Human Rights Award. In 1978, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \\"for notable services to his country\\". In 2005, he was awarded the Order of New Brunswick. His cousin Elsie Wayne was also a member of the House of Commons and served as acting leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party during 1998. A well-known Red Tory, he fought for abortion rights and bilingualism and against capital punishment. In June 1977 an amendment put forward by Gordon Fairweather to add sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act was defeated in committee: only Fairweather and Stuart Leggatt (NDP, who had introduced a similar amendment) voted in favour. When the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was being drafted, he urged addition to the Charter of protections based on physical handicap, marital status, and sexual orientation. In the 2004 election campaign, after the merger of the PC Party with the Canadian Alliance, he admitted he was struggling with the new party's social conservatism. \\"I'm a Red Tory and I'm anxious to see that the party is broadly based. The centre is where anyone who expects to form a government should be,\\" said Fairweather. \\"I don't like seeing issues that have been long settled by the Supreme Court or the Constitution or time, being hauled out of the barn.\\" Fairweather died on December 24, 2008 at the age of 85.

It is the second longest cave in Tennessee and makes the list of longest caves in the United States and in the world. History The main entrance was discovered by Aaron Higgenbotham in 1810 while he was surveying the nearby Chickamauga Trail on Cardwell Mountain in what is now Warren County. According to legend, Higgenbotham was the first man to enter the cave and it was named Higgenbotham Cave in his honor. Another smaller cave, also located on Cardwell Mountain, was also discovered about this time and was named Henshaw Cave. Although not nearly as big as Higgenbotham Cave, Henshaw Cave proved to be a source of saltpeter (the main ingredient of gunpowder) and was operated as a saltpeter mine during perhaps both the War of 1812 and the Civil War. Higgenbotham Cave became a favorite spot for local adventurers during the 19th century and groups would ride out to the entrance in hay wagons and make the strenuous trip to a point in the cave now known as the Ten Acre Room. In the days of the hay wagon parties, it was called the Big Room. Here, many visitors left their names and the date candled on the ceiling. In the early 1940s, members of the National Speleological Society (NSS) began to explore Higgenbotham Cave. Within a decade, they had greatly increased the known extent of the cave. In 1953 a connection was discovered between Henshaw Cave and Higgenbotham Cave. This connection was named the Meatgrinder because of its small size and shape. Soon afterwards, some of these explorers leased the cave from its owner, Mr. Andy Powell, and developed it into a commercial cave. The cave opened under the name Cumberland Caverns on July 4, 1956 and has been open to the public since that time.Matthews, Larry E. [1989] 2005 Cumberland Caverns A portion of the Trail of Tears passes through Cumberland Caverns property. A walking trail is open to the public. Commerce The Cumberland Caverns company offers year-round commercial tours of the cave, claiming it is the largest show cave in Tennessee. Tours include a daytime walking tour, spelunking tours, overnight tours, and educational field trips. Weddings, banquets, and birthday parties are also hosted. Before reaching the cave, tourists pass through a gift shop that sells tour tickets, souvenirs, and novelty items. Cumberland Caverns Live Cumberland Caverns was formerly home to Bluegrass Underground, a monthly music event that took place in the cave's Volcano Room. The event has become a nationally syndicated program airing on PBS.\\"PBS Arts Gallery.\\" PBS. Accessed 28/12/2012. Now, the Volcano Room is home to Cumberland Caverns Live and hosts a variety of concerts and live music, including acts like Sister Hazel, Kip Moore, and Deer Tick (band). Geology Cumberland Caverns formed in Mississippian Monteagle limestone on the western escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. The cave is home to stalagmites, stalactites, helictites, flowstone, cave pearls, botryoidal coral, gypsum flowers, needles, and pure white gypsum snow, as well as a variety of cave life. Formations of interest within the cavern include: * the \\"Volcano Room,\\" where many of the cave's commercial events are hosted. * \\"Monument Pillar,\\" a large flowstone formation. * \\"Crystal Palace,\\" which contains crystals and gypsum flowers. * three spelunking tunnels known as \\"the Devil's Backbone\\" due to their winding spine-like walkways. * the \\"Lemon Squeezer,\\" so named because its widest point is only . * \\"Bubblegum Alley,\\" a passageway similar in size to the Lemon Squeezer but with damper ground that makes it sticky. * \\"the Hall of the Mountain King,\\" whose dimensions of long by wide by tall make it one of the largest cave rooms in eastern North America.

Biography He was born in Hanover Township, New Jersey on January 5, 1818 to John Cook (1786-?) and Sarah Munn (1786-?). He married Mary Halsey Thomas (1821-?) on March 23, 1846. He served as the principal of The Albany Academy in Albany, New York from 1850 to 1852. He came to Rutgers in 1853 and was appointed professor of chemistry. His teaching duties also included mathematics and theology. Among his first research projects was the chemical analysis of marl. This research led him to determine better places to mine marl, which led to his appointment as the assistant state geologist. He published a geological survey of New Jersey to replace the one made in 1840. In 1864 he was appointed as the state geologist of New Jersey. He had become a vice president of Rutgers College and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He died on September 22, 1889 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Under the coaching of Albert Trott, Tancred developed into one of the best cricketers in the country, making his first-class debut on 7 March 1898 for Abe Bailey's Transvaal XI against Natal, scoring 57 and 4*. Tancred was second in the first-class batting averages for the 1897/98 season. Tancred made his Test debut for South Africa at Johannesburg in the first Test of the 1898/99 series against England. Opening the batting, Tancred scored 18 and seven and was dropped for the second Test. Tancred worked as secretary of the Pretoria Club until the commencement of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899, after which he enlisted in the South African Light Horse, serving as a lieutenant during the relief of Ladysmith, and was mentioned in despatches. Following the war, Tancred gained work as a customs clearing agent and was keen to return to the South African side but, while playing for Transvaal against the touring 1902 Australian side, scored one and 0 and was left out of the ensuing Test series. Tancred still harboured hopes of making the 1904 touring side to England but when he was only listed as a reserve, he supposedly lapsed into depression. Following an evening playing billiards with friends at a club in Johannesburg, Tancred borrowed a revolver and returned to the hotel in Roodepoort where he was staying. There, Tancred apparently shot himself in the head three times and was found unconscious by his brother Bernard, who had rushed to the hotel upon hearing of the revolver in Vincent’s possession. Tancred died four hours later. A bachelor, he left no heirs. Tancred’s brother Louis, a member of the South African touring team to England, heard of Vincent’s death and temporarily withdrew from the team before returning to the side to post some large scores in Vincent’s memory.

Infectious Records became part of Marshall's Mushroom Records UK (now A&E; Records) operation in the mid-1990s. Korda was also responsible for signing Muse, Paul Oakenfold and Perfecto Records to his Mushroom imprint. The first band signed to the label was PWEI, who had followed Marshall from RCA records where they had released a number of albums such as This Is The Day, This Is The Hour, This Is This!. With the sell-off of Mushroom Records' UK operations to the Warner Music Group, the role of Infectious within the A&E; operations was decreased, with most acts being labeled under Warner's main brands such as Atlantic Records. Even so, the record label was used again by the multinational group for newly signed \\"developing\\" indie acts such as The Subways, who feature under a joint City Pavement/Infectious brand name. Relaunch In January 2009 it was announced that Korda Marshall would be relaunching Infectious Records as Infectious Music Ltd. With financial support coming from theatre and sports entrepreneur Michael Watt, Marshall also brought Michael Gudinski onto the board of directors of the company. Hiring former Infectious Records executives Pat Carr of Remote Control Records and Mirelle Davis of Wind Up Bird as consultants to oversee General Management and International Marketing respectively for the new company, he has engaged Robert Horsfall and Mike Skeet’s teams at Sound Advice to handle the company’s legal and financial affairs.[1] The first signing to the newly relaunched label was Melbourne band The Temper Trap, who are also signed to Gudinski's Australian label Liberation.

The case saw the trial of a number of Indian nationalists of the Anushilan Samiti in Calcutta, under charges of \\"Waging war against the Government\\" of the British Raj. The trial was held at Alipore Sessions Court, Calcutta, between May 1908 and May 1909. The trial followed in the wake of the attempt on the life of Presidency Magistrate Douglas Kingsford in Muzaffarpur by Bengali nationalists Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki in April 1908, which was recognised by the Bengal police as linked to attacks against the Raj in the preceding years, including attempts to derail the train carrying Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser in December 1907. Among the famous accused were Aurobindo Ghosh, his brother Barin Ghosh as well as 38 other Bengali nationalists of the Anushilan Samiti. Most of the accused were arrested from Barin Ghosh's Garden house in 36 Murarirupukur Road, in the Manicktolla suburb of Calcutta. They were held in the Presidency Jail in Alipore before the trial, where Narendranath Goswami, approver and crown-witness, was shot dead by two fellow accused Kanailal Dutta and Satyendranath Bose within the jail premises. Goswami's murder led to collapse of the case against Aurobindo. However, his brother Barin and a number of others were convicted of the charges and faced varying jail terms from life- imprisonment to shorter jail terms. Aurobindo Ghosh retired from active nationalist politics after serving a prison sentence awarded in the trial, beginning his journey into spirituality and philosophy that he described as having started with revelations that occurred to him during his incarceration. He later moved to Pondicherry, establishing an Ashram. For Anushilan Samiti, the incarceration of many of its prominent leaders led to a decline in the influence and activity of the Manicktolla branch, and its activities were overtaken by what emerged to be called the Jugantar branch under the leadership of Bagha Jatin. Background=Anushilan samiti File:Young India; an interpretation and a history of the nationalist movement from within (1916) (14802200463).jpgAurobindo Ghosh File:Barindra Kumar Ghosh 01.jpgBarindra Kumar Ghosh Political consciousness and opposition to British raj in Bengal had grown steadily over the last decades of the 1800s. By 1902, Calcutta had three secret societies working toward the violent overthrow of British rule in India. These included the Anushilan Samity, founded by a Calcutta student named Satish Chandra Basu with the patronage of the Calcutta barrister Pramatha Mitra, another led by a Bengalee lady by the name of Sarala Devi, and a third one founded by Aurobindo Ghosh. Ghosh was one of the strongest proponents of militant nationalism at the time. The militant nationalists thought of more direct and violent ways of ending British rule in India ... The chief apostle of militant nationalism in Bengal was Aurobindo Ghose. In 1902, there were three secret societies in Calcutta - Anushilan Samiti, founded by Pramatha Mitra, a barrister of the High Court of Calcutta; a society sponsored by Aurobindo Ghosh and a society started by Sarala Devi. Having forsaken a potential career in the Indian Civil Service, Ghosh had returned to India and taken up an academic post under the patronage of the Maharaja of Baroda. Here he came to develop a close relationship with Indian Maratha nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and through him the nationalist network in Maharashtra. Inspired by the histories of Italian and Irish nationalism, Aurobindo began preparing the grounds and network for an Indian nationalist revolution, in which he found support in Tilak. Aurobindo sought for source of military training to prepare for a revolution in future. His younger brother Barin joined Aurobindo in Baroda. Baroda offered Barin to obtain training in military strategies and armed conflicts. In 1903, Aurobindo Ghosh sent his younger brother Barindra Kumar Ghosh to Calcutta to rally the nascent organisation. By 1905, the controversial 1905 partition of Bengal had a widespread political impact: it stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in the Bhadralok community in Bengal, and helped Anushilan acquire a support base among of educated, politically conscious and disaffected young in local youth societies throughout Bengal. The works of Aurobindo and his brother Barin Ghosh allowed Anushilan Samity to spread through Bengal. Anushilan began a program of slowly building a support base, preparing slowly and steadily for a nationalist uprising, on the lines of the Italian Carbonari. Aurobindo returned to Bengal in 1906, and with the assistance of Subodh Mallik and Bipin Chandra Pal, founded in 1907 the radical Bengali nationalist publication of Jugantar and its English counterpart Bande Mataram. After a slow start, the journal gradually grew to acquire a mass appeal in Bengal through its radicalist approach and message of revolutionary programmes. Aurobindo, active in nationalist politics in the Congress, increasingly became the prominent voice of radical nationalists including Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Pal who advocated break-away from Britain and justified violent revolution as a means to this end. Nationalist writings and publications by Aurobindo and his brother Barin included Bande Mataram, Jugantar had a widespread impact among the youth of Bengal. By 1907 it was selling 7,000 copies which later rose to 20,000. Its message, aimed at elite politically conscious readers was essentially critique and defiance of British rule in India, and justification of political violence. \\"[Sanyal translates from Jugantar:] \\"In a country where the ruling power relies on brute force to oppress its subjects, it is impossible to bring about Revolution or a change in rulers through moral strength. In such a situation, subjects too must rely on brute force.\\" ... The Jugantar challenged the legitimacy of British rule ... [its] position thus amounted to a fundamental critique of the British government ... By 1907 the paper was selling 7000 copies, a figure that went up to 20,000 soon after. The Jugantar ideology was basically addressed to an elite audience that was young, literate and politically radicalized.\\" The publication inspired a proportion of the young men who joined Anushilan Samiti cited the influence of Jugantar in their decisions. In 1907, Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo faced prosecution for the message emanating from Bande Mataram, with Pal being convicted. Meanwhile, Jugantar was also subject to close scrutiny. 32 Muraripukur Garden House Muraripukur garden house, in the Manicktolla suburbs of Calcutta. This served as the headquarters of Barin Ghosh and his associates. By 1907, Barin Ghosh had begun gathering around groups of young men attracted to the Jugantar message. This was at a time that the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti under Pulin Das was becoming active in seeking to target British administrative officers and interests as targets. Police searches and surveillance of Jugantar became routine, and the younger Ghosh cut his ties with the paper. A close group of approximately a dozen young men gathered around Barin, some of whom lived in his garden house in 36 Muraripukur lane, in the Manicktolla suburb of Calcutta. The house was intended by Barin to be organised along the lines of an ashram or hermitage along the lines of Aurobindo's message in Bhawani mandir, away from the public eye, where revolutionaries could live in strict discipline and prepare for a future revolution. Barin's group had been experimenting with production of explosives from 1906. In 1907, they were joined by Ullaskar Dutt, a self-taught chemist from the Howrah suburb of Calcutta who was attracted to the Jugantar message. The group had targeted the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal since 1906. In autumn 1906 Charu Chandra Dutt and Prafulla Chaki had made a failed attempt to assassinate the governor at Darjeeling. With Dutta's expertise, the plans were revisited. By October that year, Dutta was in a position to manufacture a bomb powerful enough to blow up a train. With dynamite obtained by Barin's group, Dutt produced a bomb with a detonator of his own manufacturing. The intended target was the train carrying the lieutenant governor of Bengal, Andrew Fraser. Through November 1907, two attempts were made to target the train carrying the lieutenant governor, which were unsuccessful. However, the group was at last successful on 5 December when Bibhutibhushan sarkar and Prafulla Chaki successfully detonated Dutt's bomb under the Governor's train at Narayangarh, near Midnapore. The Governor escaped unhurt, but security was tightened around him in the investigation that followed. In January 1908, Dutt successfully produced a more powerful picric acid bomb that was tested in Deoghar. Accidentally, a young revolutionary of Rangpur, Prafulla Kumar Chakraborty, died that time. However, by this time Bengal police had infiltrated the Medinapore branch of the Samiti through an infiltrator, who was able to pass on information on the Manisktolla ashram, which he obtained from Satyendranth Bose. This included the names of Barin Ghosh and Aurobindo, and both were soon the subject of surveillance by Calcutta police. However, the Government desisted from acting against Ghosh's group, fearful they would melt away to regroup in secret. Muzaffarpur bombings and aftermath=The plot of killing Kingsford In 1907, Barin Ghosh arranged to send Hem Chandra Kanungo (Hem Chandra Das), one of his associates, to Paris to learn the art of bomb-making from Nicholas Safranski, a Russian revolutionary in exile in the French Capital. Returning to Bengal, Hem began working with Barin Ghosh again. With Fraser alerted, a new target was selected in Douglas Kingsford. Kingsford was the Chief Magistrate of the Presidency court of Alipore, and had overseen the trials of Bhupendranath Dutta and other editors of Jugantar, sentencing them to rigorous imprisonment. \\"Bhupendranath Dutt, the editor, and proprietor of the Jugantar was arrested in July 1907 and charged under section 124 A ... Bhupendranath was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment ... The Jugantar's stance was typically defiant ... The paper did nothing to tone down the rhetoric in its future editions.\\" Jugantar itself responded with defiant editorials. The defiance of Jugantar saw it face five more prosecutions that left it in financial ruins by 1908. These prosecutions brought the paper more publicity, and helped disseminate the Samiti's ideology of revolutionary nationalism. Shukla Sanyal notes in 2014 that revolutionary terrorism as an ideology began to win support amongst a significant populace in Bengal, tacitly even if not overt. \\"This attitude cost the paper dearly. It suffered five more prosecutions that, by July 1908, brought about its financial ruin … The trials brought the paper a great deal of publicity and helped greatly in the dissemination of the revolutionary ideology ... testimony to the fanatical loyalty that the paper inspired in its readers and the deep impression that the Jugantar writings made on them ... revolutionary terrorism as an ideology began to win if not overt, then at least the tacit, support of Bengalis.\\" Kingsford also earned notoriety among nationalists when he ordered the whipping of a young Bengali boy by the name of Sushil Sen for participating in the protests that followed the Jugantar trial. The first attempt to kill Kingsford was in the form of a book bomb that Hem constructed. An empty tin of Cadbury's cocoa was packed with a pound of picric acid and three detonators. This was packed into a hollowed section of Herbert Broom's Commentaries on the Common Law and delivered wrapped in brown paper to Kingsford's house by a young revolutionary named Paresh Mallick. Kingsford placed the unopened package in his shelf to examine it later. By March 1908, fearful of the judge's safety, he was promoted to District Judge and transferred by the government to Muzaffarpur in northern part of Bihar. With him went his furniture, library and the book bomb made by Hem Chandra. Khudiram Bose, who threw the bomb at Muzaffarpur, held under guard some time after his arrest. The attempt and the failure Anushilan, under Barin, persisted in their attempts to kill Kingsford. In April, a two-man reconnaissance team visited Muzaffarpur, which included Prafulla Chaki. On their return, Hem provided the bomb that was to be used, composed of 6 ounces of dynamite, a detonator, and a black powder fuse. Prafulla returned to Muzaffarpur with a new man, Khudiram Bose. However, the outlines of these plans to attempt to take Kingsford's life had also become known to Calcutta police, and commissioner Frederick Loch Halliday had passed on the alert to the Muzaffarpur superintendent of police. Kingsford was thus alerted by the superintendent, but had ignored the warnings. Four men were assigned to guard the magistrate's house. On the evening of 29 April Bose and Chaki were in place to execute their plans. Pretending to be schoolboys, they surveyed the Muzaffarpur park, opposite The British club frequented by Kingsford. They were noticed by a constable. The next day they returned and, being noticed by the same constable, they scurried away. The duo moved away, then doubled back, hiding in a tree with the bomb. Kingsford was playing bridge that night at the club with his wife and the wife and daughter of a local barrister, Pringle Kennedy. Finishing the last game at 8:30 in the evening, the group broke up to head home. Kingsford and his wife were in a carriage identical to and immediately behind that carrying the Kennedys. As the first carriage passed the tree hiding Chaki and Bose, Bose ran up to the carriage and threw his bomb through the carriage window. Both the occupants were fatally wounded. Escaping in the ensuing confusion, Bose and Chaki broke up and left the town separately. Bose walked through the night, reaching a small town called Waini, from where he intended to take the train back to Calcutta. Unfamiliar with the place, he came under the scrutiny of two constables and was caught while attempting to escape. Chaki, in the meantime, was able to take a different train, but came under the suspicion of an off-duty policeman named Nandalal Bannerjee. Bannerjee telegraphed Calcutta, and upon receiving instructions to detain Chaki, attempted to arrest. Chaki attempted to escape from the platform fighting his way through with his revolver and, down to his last bullet, shot himself in the mouth. Arrest File:Aurobindo jail picture.JPGAurobindo on the day of his arrest on May 1, 1908 News of the bombings reached Calcutta on 1 May 1908, and suspicion was immediately on Aurobindo and Barin. Fraser, the Governor of Bengal, contemplated arrest and deportation of the Samiti leadership of the Ghosh brothers, Abhinash Bhattacharya, Hemchandra Das and Satyendranath Bosu. Fraser feared that the evidence may not be sufficient to obtain conviction in a formal trial. By the time Fraser had wired the Government of India however, Halliday, unaware of Fraser's actions, begun the process of charging Aurobindo and the Manicktolla group. By 7'o clock in the evening, warrants had been obtained to search eight places in Calcutta and the Manicktolla suburbs, and an operation was put in motion which involved all of Calcutta's police superintendents, nearly twelve inspectors, and more than a hundred constables. A news of the killings broke in the evening newspapers in Calcutta. Barin and his group, warned by Aurobindo, began hiding away arms, ammunition, and bombs in various stages of preparation at the house in Muraripukur lane that served as the headquarters. The place also contained a substantial amount of incriminating papers which the group attempted to burn. On 2 May 1908, police arrested an initial 33 suspects. Aurobindo, Sailen Bose and Abhinash Bhattacharya were arrested from Ghosh's Grey Street office where the trio were staying and his writings and letters were confiscated by the police. They were taken to the police headquarters at Lal Bazar at midday, and then held at the detective headquarters at Royd Street overnight, before being produced in front of Commissioner Halliday the following morning. Meanwhile, seven additional police teams raided properties linked to the Ghosh brothers in North Calcutta, including the residences in Scott Street and in Harrison Road. A search in this second place uncovered large amounts of explosives, bombs, and chemicals left behind by Ullaskar Dutta. Meanwhile, Barin and fourteen others were arrested in a raid at the Maniktala garden premises where they had been staying the night before. A search of the premises led to the discovery large amounts of arms and ammunitions the group had attempted to hide away, while a large amount of incriminating documents and papers that the group had not managed to burn were also seized. Statement by Barin Ghosh Fearing that the entire Samiti organisation stood at jeopardy, Barin offered to make a confessional statement taking responsibility for the conspiracy and the materiel. Convinced that they would be awarded the death penalty in any case, Barin was joined in written statements by Ullashkar Dutt, Indubhushan Roy and Bibhutibhushan Sarkar who implicated themselves taking entire responsibility with written statements, later confirmed orally in front of a magistrate. Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others The trial room, Alipore Sessions Court, Calcutta in 1997. The Maniktala gardens under the jurisdiction of the Alipore suburb of Calcutta. On 5 May 1908, Aurobindo and others were produced in front of the chief presidency magistrate's court, where they were allowed access to lawyers for the first time. From here the case was transferred to the Alipore chief magistrate's court, and the accused were held at Alipore jail, with Aurobindo held in solitary confinement. Initial hearings On 18 May, the accused were formally charged in the first hearing of Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others. The charges included \\"organising to wage war against the government\\" and charging each individual accused with \\"waging war against the King\\". The prosecution was headed by Eardley Norton, a leading barrister of the then presidency of Madras. The hearing was assigned to the court of additional district magistrate, Leonard Birley, ICS. Birley started hearing evidence from the 222 witnesses even before formal charges had been pressed. Nearly 2000 material and documentary exhibits formed the evidence. In total, ultimately 49 stood accused. They were held separately from other prisoners. In the middle of June, the accused were transferred to a three- roomed wing at Alipore Jail, from where they were later moved to Ward 23 of Alipore jail. The hearings against the accused had continued through May with intermittent recesses. However, despite a considerable body of evidence against most of the accused, very little evidence existed against Aurobindo himself. The structure of Anushilan Samiti prevented the higher echelons of the organisation from becoming familiar to the junior ranks, and Aurobindo's involvement in the organisation and its activities were hard to pinpoint, except for a few letters and correspondences confiscated at Barin's Manicktolla garden house. These included letters Barin had written in 1907, initialled \\"A.G.\\" proclaiming the time for distributing \\"sweets\\" across India, an euphemism for bombs of which the technology Hem Chandra had learnt in Paris. On the other hand, much of the aim of the prosecution was to gain conviction against Aurobindo, who was seen as the most dangerous individual driving the Samiti against the Raj. Murder of Naren Goswami Unable to identify stronger material evidence, the prosecution began an effort to obtain witnesses who may be able to implicate Aurobindo. Their target became a young Anushilanite by the name of Naren Goswami. Goswami belonged to the family of a landowner in Bengal, of a wealthy background and social standing. He had been arrested at Maniktala with Barin and others on the initial raid. On 22 June, Prosecutor Norton announced to the court that Narendranath Goswami had turned \\"King's witness\\", or prosecution witness, in return for a pardon. By the middle of August, Birley had heard evidence against the accused. He twice rejected the defence's requests to cross-examine Goswami, using discretionary powers granted to him by the government of Bengal. On 19, 31 August prisoners were committed to stand trial at Alipore Sessions Court for waging war against the King. On the evidence against Aurobindo, Birley concluded that letters and correspondences from members of the group --- particularly one letter from Barin where he had referred to \\"distributing sweets\\" across India --- indicated prima facie involvement on Aurobindo's part. Kanailal Dutt (2nd from right) and Satyen Basu (4th from right), under arrest after assassinating Naren Goswami. Interned with his fellow conspirators, Barin Ghosh had carefully planned to stage a jail-break. Careful plans were made to overpower guards with acid, bombs and with arms smuggled into the jail with the help of Samiti members and of family members. By the last week of August, Barin was able to obtain two revolvers, a R.I.C. 0.45 calibre and an Osborne 0.38 calibre revolver. However, the accused soon realised that Goswami knew more than anticipated, and his evidence may implicate many accused including the Ghosh Brothers. A decision was taken by Hem Chandra Das to silence Naren. On 29 August, Kanailal Dutt feigned abdominal colic and gained admission to the Jail hospital, from where he sent word to Naren of wishing to turn approver, along with Satyendranath Bosu. Naren, believing the ruse, walked into the Hospital ward to meet the duo with the jail overseer. Armed with the two revolvers smuggled in at Barin's request, Sen and Dutta chased Goswami down the jail corridors. The overseer accompanying Goswami, Warden Higgins, attempted to overpower Dutt but was shot through the wrist. Another overseer named Lynton tried to overpower Bose, but the latter broke free. Both Bose and Dutt shot Goswami multiple times, hitting his hip and piercing his spine, wounding him fatally. Bose and Dutta, firing nine shots in total into Goswami's lifeless body, gave themselves up once they realised Goswami was dead. Dutta later pleaded guilty, was convicted and hanged. Bose was initially declared not guilty by jury, but the verdict was returned to the high court which returned a guilty verdict and awarded him the death sentence. Alipore sessions court On 19 October 1908, the hearing for the trial began at the court of Charles Poten Beachroft who served as the additional sessions judge of the District 24 Paraganas. Beechcroft and Aurobindo had previously entered the Indian Civil Service Examinations in England in the same year, where Aurobindo had ranked ahead of Beechcroft. The defence team was composed of 15 lawyers, barristers and pleaders. Aurobindo was initially represented by Byomkesh Chakravarty, a leading Calcutta barrister. In addition to the 1500 documents and material evidence, defence team entered further 54 items. However, Chakravarty was successfully able to challenge Norton's attempts to enter Goswami's testimony as evidence, and able to obtain Beachcroft's ruling that Birley broke the law in refusing to allow defence to cross-examine Goswami. The trial continued for a year (1908-1909). In all, 206 witnesses were called, around 400 documents were filed with the court, and more than 5000 exhibits were produced including bombs, revolvers, and acids. However, Chakravarty soon pulled out of Ghosh's defence team, as the funds failed to meet his fees. On the desperate appeal of Ghosh's uncle Krishna Kumar Mitra, the defence was taken over by Chittaranjan Das, then still a junior barrister. Early in the trial, Barin and his fellow detainees from the Manicktolla ashram withdrew their confessions. Despite this, the scope lay to use their evidences against themselves. However, the prosecution's efforts to link Aurobindo to the group and to implicate him as the leader of the conspiracy began to unravel. With assassination of Naren Goswami, precious little remained to link Aurobindo to the works of Barin's group other than his published views in Bande Mataram and Jugantar. Das successfully argued that Aurobindo's thoughts and writings on independence were consistent with philosophical thoughts on liberty and freedom held by the English intelligentsia. On material evidences, Das alleged outright fabrication of documents by the police where these linked Aurobindo to the conspiracy. Significantly, as the hearings proceeded through 1908 into 1909, the government of Bengal came to fear that Anushilan Samiti would mount a rescue mission to break out the undertrials. A noted rise in militant actions and assassinations linked to Anushilan Samiti in wider Bengal began to be reported, reaching the premises of the Alipore court as the hearings drew to a close. In November 1908, two assassinations were attempted in Calcutta two days apart, one targeting Chief of Police Andrew Fraser and the second where Nandalal Bannerjee --- the police officer who had arrested Prafulla Chaki --- was gunned down, both in public. That same month, a police informant was killed and mutilated in Dacca. A shaken Bengal government arrested and deported a number of Anushilan leaders, including Raja Subodh Mallik, Aurobindo's uncle Krishna Kumar Mitra, and Bande Mataram editor Shyamsunder Chakravarty to Rangoon. In response, in March 1909, Anushilan assassinated public prosecutor Ashutosh Biswas when he was gunned down by Charu Bose in the very steps of the Alipore High court where the hearings were beginning to draw to a close. The final arguments for prosecution and defence began amidst tight security at the end of March, 1909. Das, closing his argument for defense, famously stated: The verdict File:Barindra Kumar Ghosh 01.jpgBarindra Kumar Ghosh, sentenced to death, later converted to transportation to Cellular Jail, Andamans Beechcroft delivered his verdicts on 6 May 1909, amidst tight security in Calcutta to prevent outbreak of nationalist violence. Observing the popular supports following the executions of Kshudiram Bose, Kanailal Dutta and Satyen Bose, the day of the verdict was kept closely guarded. Additional security measures were put in place, with a reserve force of European officers held ready in case of an outbreak of violence and disorder in the streets of Calcutta. Sessions Judge Charles Porten Beachcroft delivered his verdicts on 6 May 1909, amidst tight security in Calcutta. Regarding Sri Aurobindo, he said: In his verdict, Barin Ghosh and Ullaskar Dutt were found guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging (later commuted to life imprisonment). Thirteen others, Upendra Nath Banerjee, Bibhuti Bhusan Sarkar, Hrishikesh Kanjilal, Birendra Sen, Sudhir Sarkar, Indra Nundy, Abinash Bhattacharjee, Soilendra Bose, Hem Chunder Das, Indu Bhusan Roy, Poresh Mullick, Sishir Ghosh, Nirapado Roy were sentenced to transportation for life and forfeiture of all property. Three others, Poresh Mullick, Sishir Ghosh, Nirapado Roy were sentenced to ten years incarceration along with forfeiture of property. A further three Asoke Nundy, Balkrishna Kane, Susil Sen were sentenced to seven years jail terms. Seventeen, including Aurobindo, were found not guilty. One defendant, Kristo Jibon Sanyal, was sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment. Two of the 17 acquitted, Dharaninath Gupta & Nagendranath Gupta, were already undergoing a 7-year sentence for conviction in the Harrison Road case, so they were not released. Probash Chunder Dey was re-arrested on a sedition charge under Section 124A, in connection with the publication of the book \\"Desh Acharjya\\". The verdict on Aurobindo was passed last. Beechcroft highlighted the lack of concrete evidence linking Aurobindo to the conspiracy in the lack of crown-witness Naren Goswami. The verdict was disappointing to the Government of India, who had hoped to obtain a conviction against Aurobindo. Further fears were raised that those acquitted may have already received instructions from Hem on constructing the bombs. Aurobindo further was seen as the most dangerous adversary to the Raj whilst he remained free. Consulted on the prospects of a successful appeal against the verdict on Aurobindo, the advocate general of Bombay the chance of obtaining a conviction \\"fair\\", but was unable to provide more reassuring prospects. In August 1909, the government took the decision not to launch an appeal. Of the two sentenced to death by hanging (but released in 1920), Ullaskar Dutt, a young man of 22, described his occupation as a cow keeper. Barindra Kumar Ghosh, younger brother of Aurobindo Ghosh, was a key player in the Alipore trial. It was in their house that the revolutionaries carried out their activities. Barindra had been born in England and came to India at the age of one. According to British Indian law, he was asked whether he preferred being tried as a British citizen. Barin, as a patriot, refused. Those two were sentenced to death, with the sentence later commuted to life imprisonment in the Cellular Jail in Andamans, where they remained until a general amnesty, in 1920. Popular perception The trial was considered sensational at the time, and generated an enormous amount of interest in both the British and Indian press. In India, journals such as The Empire ran editorials calling for harsh punishments for the undertrials. The Times published a number of reports, reflecting on Aurobindo's career, Aurobindo's monologues and essays, published in Karmayogin, Jugantar, and other publications. Impact In the aftermath of the trial, the power of native Indian press in promoting nationalist messages were severely curtailed, with the Indian Press act of 1910 allowing provincial governments to demand punitive deposits from journals deemed hostile to the Raj. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who had close ties with Aurobindo, was arrested and charged with sedition, subsequently found guilty despite publicly dissociating himself from the Muzzafarpur bombings. In the aftermath of these events, moderates in the Indian National Congress came to be a more prominent force within the organisation, and developed a closer working relationship with the Raj. The Minto-Morley reforms were passed in 1910. Historians like Peter Heehs argue that although these had been planned as early as 1906, the popular impact of the trials hastened, or were perceived to hasten, the passage. In the view of the larger population, the actions of Aurobindo and his group took credit for this. Aftermath Aurobindo Ghosh was acquitted of the charges (among 17 acquitted) and came out of the affair with a new outlook on life and spirituality (see final conversion). He recused himself from active politics, ultimately settling to his ashram in Pondicherry. Barin was interred till 1920, and after being released from jail he worked as a journalist, including The Statesman. He died in 1959. Aurobindo retired from active politics after he was acquitted. Aurobihdo’s retirement from active politics after his acquittal ... This was followed by a 1909 Dhaka conspiracy case, which brought 44 members of the Dhaka Anushilan to trial. In the aftermath of the Manicktala conspiracy, the western Anushilan Samiti found a more-prominent leader in Bagha Jatin and emerged as the Jugantar. Jatin revitalised links between the central organisation in Calcutta and its branches in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, establishing hideouts in the Sunderbans for members who had gone underground.M.N. Roy's Memoirs p3 The group slowly reorganised, aided by Amarendra Chatterjee, Naren Bhattacharya and other younger leaders. Some of its younger members, including Taraknath Das, left India. Between 1909 and 1914, the group continued its campaign against the interests, making a number of attempts on the lives of Raj officials with variable successes. In a concerted attempt of revenge, Ashutosh Biswas, an advocate of Calcutta High Court in charge of the prosecution of the Gossain murder case, was shot dead within Calcutta High Court in 1909. In 1910, Shamsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Bengal Police responsible for investigating the Alipore Bomb case, was shot dead on the steps of Calcutta High Court. Naren Bannerjee, the police officer who arrested Kshudiram Bose, was murdered in 1910. These assassinations led up to the uncovering of Jatin's network, precipitating the Howrah-Sibpur Conspiracy case. Undeterred, the Samiti's networks continued the attempts on political violence and assassinations, using its base in Chandernagore. The most notable was the attempt on the life of Viceroy of India in 1912 in a conspiracy headed by Rash Behari Bose. However, the most serious threat organised by the Samiti arose in 1914 when, with the clouds of war gathering in Europe in 1914, the Samiti began liaising with revolutionary groups abroad and with Imperial Germany to overthrow the British Raj with a Pan-Indian Mutiny.

La Cañada Flintridge, 435 F. 3d 993 (9th Cir. 2006), was a case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that determined whether a city could, consistent with California and Federal law, deny a telecommunications company a permit to construct and to install a wireless antenna based on aesthetic considerations.  Background  In October 2001, the city of La Cañada Flintridge enacted Ordinance 324, that described four criteria that applicants must satisfy in order to receive a Public Right-of-Way Above Ground Construction permit: # The proposed above- ground structure does not obstruct access for pedestrians, nor block view [sic] of vehicles, pedestrians or bicyclists. # The proposed above-ground structure is compatible with existing above-ground structures along the public right-of-way, and does not result in an over-concentration of above-ground structures along the public right-of-way. # The proposed above-ground structure preserves the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood, and minimizes public views of the above-ground structure. # The proposed above-ground structure does not result in a negative aesthetic impact on the public right-of-way or the surrounding neighborhood. Sprint applied for 5 permits not long after the city enacted the ordinance and was granted two, denied two, and withdrew one. The contested permits involved one for a wireless facility along Figueroa St. in December 2001, and another along Descanso Dr. in July 2002 that Sprint intended to construct. Following a series of appeals through the city's Public Works and Traffic Commission, Sprint plead its case to the city council which subsequently denied the permits on the following grounds: # The facilities \\"will significantly damage the existing character of the neighborhood and result in a negative aesthetic impact on the right-of-way\\" # \\"The proposed Project will change the character of the neighborhood and will result in a negative aesthetic impact on the public right-of-way\\" # \\"The antennas will negatively impact the residence's views and the character of the neighborhood.\\" # The antennas are \\"unsightly.\\" Subsequently, Sprint sued the city in United States District Court where a summary judgment was ruled in favor of the city.  The Decision  The court rejected La Cañada's view that aesthetic reasons are substantial evidence to support a denial of permit. The court rejected this reasoning, citing the California Public Utility Code § 7901 only granted local authority the right to control how roads \\"are accessed,\\" not how they look. In addition, the city also argued that the Telecom Act (47 United States Code § 332(c)(7)(A)) because it provided that: > [E]xcept as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this Chapter shall limit > or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality > thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and > modification of personal wireless service facilities. However, the court interpreted this to mean simply that local laws must be respected. As such, \\"if the local law itself is invalid—for example, because it conflicts with state law—then subsection (c)(7)(A) will not save it. If the Telecom Act intended to grant such authority to local laws—even those that are preempted by state laws—it might have preserved the authority of \\"State and local government[s],\\" rather than the disjunctive.\\"  External links  *Opinion of the Court Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases Category:2006 in United States case law ","title":"Sprint PCS, L.P. v.

The 807 Area Code was created in early 1962 when this region of Ontario split from area code 705. The main reason for the split was not the exhaustion of 705, but rather for routing efficiency for calls from Western Canada to northwestern Ontario; such routing efficiency can now be achieved using the highly-computerized digital exchanges that did not exist in the 1960s. Major communities served by the 807 area code include Thunder Bay, Kenora, Dryden, Fort Frances, Rainy River, Marathon, and Greenstone. The area is split between the Central and Eastern time zones. The incumbent local exchange carriers in 807 are Tbaytel, Bell Canada and Bell Aliant's Dryden Municipal Telephone Service. 807 is one of the least populated area codes in Canada. It is less than 40% used, and CNAC estimates that it will not be exhausted for many decades. In the early 21st century, as 705 neared exhaustion, CNAC briefly considered \\"erasing\\" the 807-705 boundary and turning 807 into an overlay for all of Ontario north and west of the Golden Horseshoe. However, because of the potential for confusion, this solution was ultimately not implemented. As a result, 807 is the only area code in Ontario without an overlay, and hence the only one still with 7-digit dialling. Other such Canadian area codes are 506, 709 and 867.http://www.cnac.ca/npa_codes/relief/705/documents/NPA_705_PD_20_July_2009.doc Although Northwestern Ontario should not need an additional area code any time soon, it is still possible that 10-digit dialing may be implemented in the area in the near future.

She is the chairman emeritus of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Early life and background Wilsey was born Diane Dow Buchanan. Her father, Wiley T. Buchanan, Jr., was the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg and Austria, as well as the White House Chief of Protocol under Dwight Eisenhower. Her privileged childhood featured summers at the family estate Beaulieu House in Newport, Rhode Island, and in the south of France. When she made her social debut in 1961, as a Connecticut College student, Town & Country Magazine featured her on its cover. Personal life She married shipping magnate and art collector John Traina in 1965 and had two sons, Todd and Trevor Traina. Her father was opposed to his daughter's marriage. In 1980, she divorced Traina. In 1980, she married dairy millionaire Al Wilsey, who had recently divorced his third wife, Patricia Montandon. She and Wilsey were fixtures on the social axes of San Francisco and Napa Valley, where they maintained a country house. Al Wilsey died in 2002 at age 82. She remains a prominent figure in the artistic and cultural spheres of San Francisco. In 2005, she raised $190 million to rebuild the earthquake-damaged De Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, one of the largest collective gifts ever made to an American museum. She has raised millions for local causes like the renovation of Grace Cathedral, as well as the establishment of numerous trusts for organizations such as the San Francisco Ballet and the San Francisco Opera. Controversy Wilsey is featured prominently in her stepson Sean Wilsey's memoir Oh the Glory of it All, in which the author described her as his \\"evil stepmother\\", and contended that she married Al Wilsey because of his wealth. In March 2013, Wilsey was accused of creating turmoil among the staff at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, following the death of its longtime director, John Buchanan. She was accused of allegedly using her affluence and influence as board president to fire many long-term curators, using museum personnel to tend to her personal collection, and forcing a show of her son's photos. In July 2016, it was reported that Wilsey was stepping down from her position as lifetime board president \\"after the museums paid a $2 million settlement to a former high-ranking executive who said Wilsey had her ousted for revealing alleged misspending of museum money.\\" However, as of May 2019 she was still listed on the FAMSF website as President and Chair of the museums' governing boards.

The storm took its name from the resulting collapse of the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington, D.C. shortly after 9 p.m. on January 28 which killed 98 people and injured 133. Setup for the event An Arctic airmass was in place across the northeast United States; Washington, D.C. had been below freezing since the afternoon of January 23. The front that spawned the cyclone was almost completely dry until after it crossed the Gulf of Mexico, making this storm unique among large southeast snowstorms. Despite the slow start, a low formed and deepened rapidly off the Georgia coast as the cold front reached the Gulf Stream on January 27. Heavy snow quickly developed from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania as the low drifted north to the Outer Banks of North Carolina on the 28th. A strong high pressure to the north helped to cut the system off from the jet stream. As a result, the cyclone took three days to move up the East Coast of the United States which was double the normal time used by forecasters of that era to move storm systems up the coast. Snow reached Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. by noon on January 28, and continued into the morning of January 29. Temperatures remained in the 20s Fahrenheit (-5 °C) through much of the event. Impact Deep snow drifts near the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. An estimated 22,400 square miles (58,000 km²) of the northeast United States were affected by 20 inches (51 cm) of snow from this cyclone, which was over one- fifth of the total area that received over 4 in (10 cm) of snow. Snowfall was quite heavy in Maryland and Virginia. Richmond, Virginia recorded . Baltimore was paralyzed as it received the most snowfall within 24 hours since 1872. Parts of North Carolina also received over one foot of snow.  Impact in Washington, D.C.  The measured snow depth at the main observing site in Washington, D.C. reached 28 in (71 cm) while an observer in Rock Creek Park a few miles to the north measured 33 in (84 cm) with 3.02 in (76.7 mm) of liquid equivalent. Railroad lines between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. were covered by at least 36 in (91 cm) of snow, with drifts as high as 16 ft (4.9 m). This snowstorm is the biggest in the history of Washington, D.C. since official record keeping began in 1885 (although it is dwarfed by the of snow in the Washington–Jefferson Storm of January 1772). Among other disruptions, Congress adjourned as a result of the storm. Theater roof collapse Interior of the Knickerbocker Theatre after the collapse of the roof as a result of the weight of snow from the storm. The Knickerbocker Theatre was the largest and newest movie house in Washington, D.C., built in 1917 and owned by Harry M. Crandall. The roof was flat, which allowed the snow to collect on it. During the movie's (Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford) intermission, the heavy, wet snow split the roof down the middle, bringing down the balcony as well as a portion of the brick wall. Dozens were buried. The disaster ranks as one of the worst in Washington, D.C. history. Congressman Andrew Jackson Barchfeld was among those killed in the theater. The theater's architect, Reginald Wyckliffe Geare, and owner, Harry M. Crandall, later killed themselves.

The steel-string model was introduced in 1987 and was discontinued in 2006. Chet Atkins CE was the original nylon string version of 1982 and possibly the first of its kind. Design The SST was a design that combined Gibson's acoustic and electric guitar technology. The SST had a solid spruce or cedar top and a mahogany body. Unlike most acoustic- electrics, the SST had no resonating chamber or soundhole. The acoustic sound came from a bridge mounted transducer with an active pre-amp. The SST had controls for volume as well as boost and cut for both treble and bass signals. The SST was offered in five finishes: natural, ebony, white, burgundy and cherry sunburst. It had mother of pearl inlays on the fretboard, headstock, and bridge and features gold plated hardware. Later models had star inlays and a Les Paul style headstock. It also sports Chet Atkins's signature above the fretboard. Popular use The SST quickly became popular among rock and country players because high volume levels could be reached without any feedback, whereas most traditional acoustic electrics will emit moderate to high levels of feedback when they come near amplifiers, speakers or microphones.

Early life Shalders was born in Kimberley, where his parents, John and Emily Shalders, owned the Halfway House inn from 1884 to 1925. He attended Kimberley Boys' High School. Cricket career He was a stroke-playing opening batsman whose impetuosity often led to his dismissal in the twenties or thirties.Christopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers, Rigby, Adelaide, 1983, p. 312. His highest Test score was 42 in his second Test, when South Africa took a first-innings lead of 65 over Australia only to lose by 159 runs. He made a valuable 38 when South Africa beat England by one wicket in the 1905-06 series. He toured England with the South African team in 1901, 1904 and 1907, playing 58 of his 88 first-class matches in England and scoring his two first-class centuries. In 1901 he was the South Africans' second-highest run-scorer, with 782 runs at an average of 30.07, with a top score of 103 against Somerset. In 1907 he scored 105 against Hampshire. His highest first-class score in South Africa was 93, the highest score of the match, in an innings victory for Transvaal over Natal in 1903-04. He was also a fine fieldsman and useful bowler. Life outside cricket He was a member of the Kimberley Town Guard during the Siege of Kimberley (October 1899 to February 1900) and was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal and the Kimberley Star. He also served in World War I.\\"Cricket and Rugby Players and the War\\", The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 21 November 1914, p. 342. He was married to Myra Shalders.

The company was also particularly active in Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other European countries. Through its part-owned Belgian subsidiary SPE it was also involved in nuclear power generation. The company conducted a merger of equals with fellow utility company Suez on 22 July 2008 to form GDF Suez. Its head office was located in the 17th arrondissement of Paris.  History  The head office, rue Philibert Delorme, Paris 17th arr. Gaz de France was created with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) in 1946 by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. With part-privatisation EDF and Gaz de France latterly became two totally separate entities, with each controlling a distribution subsidiary responsible for running its distribution system. For Gaz de France, this was the Gaz de France Distributor. Together, these two distributors managed a joint department, “EDF Gaz de France Distribution” formerly called “EDF GDF Services, which was responsible for field-based activities (meter reading, activating connections, engineering work, etc.). In January 2008 EDF Gaz de France Distribution was split into two entities: ErDF (Électricité réseau distribution France), 100% owned by EDF, and GrDF (Gaz réseau distribution France), wholly owned by Gaz de France (and now by GDF Suez). The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the State of France. The government continued to hold an approximate 80% stake in the company until the 2008 merger with Suez. The French state now holds approximately 35.7% of GDF Suez. Merger with Suez On 25 February 2006 French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of Suez and GDF, which would make the world's largest liquefied natural gas company. Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. The merger was overseen by R N Rothschild & Sons Investment Bank. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France. The French state would hold more than 35% of shares of the merged company, GDF Suez. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, he subsequently accepted the government proposal. This plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left, which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions. In retaliation, the opposition submitted 137,449 amendments to the plan. Under normal parliamentary procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years. The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used. Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 2 September 2007 the boards of directors of Gaz de France and Suez approved the new framework for the planned merger between the companies. The newly created company, GDF Suez, came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility and a group of €74 billion of revenues.

Common variations are ''''' (\\"not for us, but for everyone\\") and '''''. It means that people should contribute to the general greater good of humanity, apart from their own interests.  Origin  The motto is derived from a sentence in Cicero's most influential philosophical work, his treatise On Duties (Latin: De Officiis). In full, Cicero writes, \\"'\\" (\\"Not for us alone are we born; our country, our friends, have a share in us\\"; De Officiis, 1:22). The sentence, as Cicero himself says, is a literal translation of a sentiment from Plato's Epistle to Archytas.Ps.-Plato, Epistle 9.358a In the context of the passage, the sentence means that \\"humans have been created for the sake of others of their kind, indeed, to benefit each other as much as possible\\". Cicero associates this concept with the Stoic ideal of cosmopolitanism, according to which all men have a natural kinship with all other men and need to \\"contribute to the general good by an interchange of acts of kindness (officia), by giving and receiving.\\"De officiis 1.22, transl. Walter Miller, 1913  Usage by organizations  The motto is used by numerous organizations, including the United States Army 1st Maintenance Company and schools including Massanutten Academy, Pennthorpe School, Lower Canada College, University College, Durham, University of Victoria's St. Joseph School of Nursing, Washburn University, Willamette University , Swarthmore College (Class of 1918's motto) , and Camp Kanawana, a YMCA camp north of Montreal, Quebec. It is the motto of the Baron Haden-Guest and appears in the Baron's coat of arms. The motto was also incorporated into the coat of arms for Frank Seiberling and appears over the entrance to Stan Hywet, their Akron, Ohio mansion built in the early 1900s. This motto was also part of the crest of the family of George Fosberry, soldier and arms designer.

The area code was created in 1955 in a split of numbering plan area (NPA) 902. History The Maritimes provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island) were designated as a single numbering plan area (NPA) in 1947, when the North American Numbering Plan was inaugurated in Canada and the United States, receiving area code 902. After the addition of Newfoundland in 1949, New Brunswick and Newfoundland were split off in 1955 with area code 506. This configuration existed only until 1962, when Newfoundland was assigned area code 709, leaving New Brunswick as a distinct numbering plan area, with area code 506. Since this persists until today without any overlay code, seven-digit dialing is still possible in New Brunswick, along with numbering plan areas 709, 807, and 867 in Canada. Area code 506 was expected to face numbering exhaustion in 2020, and was to be overlaid with area code 428, beginning November 21, 2020, with permissive ten-digit dialing to start in May 2020. However, the projected exhaust date was delayed to April 2023 and the implementation date has therefore been postponed to April 23, 2022. The incumbent local exchange carrier for area code 506 is Bell Aliant, which was produced from a merger that included NBTel.

Goals, composition, methods  The group's efforts are directed towards knocking down oil production in the Niger-Delta region and claims to expose exploitation and oppression of the people of the Niger-Delta and devastation of the natural environment as a result of public-private partnerships between the Federal Government of Nigeria and corporations involved in the production of oil in the Niger Delta. Its composition includes members of the Ijaw who accuse the government and overseas oil firms with promoting massive economic inequalities, fraud, and environmental degradation. MEND’s methods include kidnap-for-ransom of oil workers, staging armed assaults on production sites, pipeline destruction, murder of Nigerian police officers, and draining off of oil and sell it to the black market. MEND's other goals include localizing control of Nigeria's oil and securing reparations from the federal government for pollution caused by the oil industry. In an interview with one of the group's leaders, who used the alias Major-General Godswill Tamuno, the BBC reported that MEND was fighting for \\"total control\\" of the Niger-Delta's oil wealth, saying local people had not gained from the riches under the ground and the region's creeks and swamps.\\"Nigeria's shadowy oil rebels. BBC News Online. April 20, 2006. MEND has been linked to attacks on petroleum operations in Nigeria as part of the conflict in the Niger Delta, engaging in actions including sabotage, theft, property destruction, guerrilla warfare, and kidnapping. In a January 2006 email, MEND warned the oil industry -- > \\"It must be clear that the Nigerian government cannot protect your workers > or assets. Leave our land while you can or die in it.... Our aim is to > totally destroy the capacity of the Nigerian government to export oil.\\" Additionally MEND called upon then President, Olusegun Obasanjo, to free two jailed Ijaw leaders — Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who was in jail at the time on charges of treason, and Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a former governor of Bayelsa State convicted of corruption. Obasanjo's successor, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua authorised the release of Dokubo-Asari and Alamieyeseigha in 2007.International Crisis Group (December 5, 2007). Nigeria - Ending the unrest in the Niger Delta . Africa Report No. 135.  Recent tactics  MEND's attacks involve substantially more sophisticated tactics than those of previous militant groups in the Niger Delta. MEND's recent tactics include: *Swarm-based maneuvers, where guerrillas use speed boats in the Niger Delta's swamps to quickly attack targets in succession. Multiple, highly maneuverable units have kept the government and Shell's defensive systems off-balance in defending their sprawling networks; *Radically-improved firepower and combat training which allow guerrillas to overpower a combination of Shell's Western- trained private military guards and elite Nigerian units in several engagements; *Effective use of system disruption, in this method, targets have been systematically and accurately selected to completely shut down production and delay and/or halt repairs and make effective use of Shell's hostages to coerce both the government and the multinational. The militant group has repeatedly bombed pipelines, triggering an international increase in the cost of oil. Origins and context For the roughly fifty years since Nigeria declared independence from British colonial rule, oil has been produced in Nigeria. Throughout this period, corporate politics has intersected with successive dictatorships. Under these dictatorships the Nigerian government has signed laws that appropriated oil resources and placed these under the control of multinational oil companies, such as Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell. From the point of view of MEND, and its supporters, the people of the Niger Delta have suffered an unprecedented degradation of their environment due to unchecked pollution produced by the oil industry. As a result of this policy of dispossessing people from their lands in favor of foreign oil interests, within a single generation, many now have no ability to fish or farm. People living in the Niger Delta have found themselves in a situation where their government and the international oil companies own all the oil under their feet, the revenues of which are rarely seen by the people who are suffering from the consequences of oil extraction. Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, has said of the situation: > The oil companies can't pretend they don't know what's happening all around > them. The Nigerian government obviously has the primary responsibility to > stop human rights abuse. But the oil companies are directly benefiting from > these crude attempts to suppress dissent, and that means they have a duty to > try and stop it. Eghare W.O. Ojhogar, chief of the Ugborodo community, said: \\"It is like paradise and hell. They have everything. We have nothing... If we protest, they send soldiers.\\" Over the last twenty years various political movements and activists have emerged in opposition to the perceived injustices perpetrated upon the people of the Niger Delta by the government and the oil companies. These were usually nonviolent; Ken Saro-Wiwa was the most famous activist. Saro-Wiwa was an Ogoni poet-turned-activist who was executed by the Nigerian government in 1995 on what many believe to be deliberately false charges with the aim of silencing his vocal opposition to the oil interests in Nigeria. In Saro-Wiwa's footsteps came others who, having seen the government's reaction to nonviolent activism, advocated violence as resistance to what they regarded as the enslavement of their people. Militants in the delta enjoy widespread support among the region's approximately 20 million people, most of whom live in poverty despite the enormous wealth generated in the oil-rich region.http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=13121 With this background, a series of meetings In November 2005 between representatives from the Federation of Niger Delta Ijaw Communities (FNDIC), the Niger Delta Peoples Volunteer Force (NDPVF), along with fighters from Cult groups such as Klansmen Konfraternity (KK) and Greenlanders led to the emergence of a new group called MEND. An agreement was also made to start using militant force to attack oil installations. Following a string of Boko Haram bombings in Nigeria in the 2010s, and many attacks against Christian targets, MEND threatened to bomb mosques and assassinate Muslim clerics. MEND spokesman Jomo Gbomo said a campaign will start on 31 May \\"to save Christianity in Nigeria from annihilation. The bombings of mosques, haj camps, Islamic institutions, large congregations in Islamic events and assassinations of clerics that propagate doctrines of hate will form the core mission of this crusade.\\" However, Operation Barbarossa would be called off if Christian organisations and the Henry Okah intervene; it further called on Boko Haram to stop attacking Christians and churches. It then announced a suspension of the plans after calls from religious groups and prominent citizens such as Henry Okah. Constituency and organization MEND is closely connected with Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force, a rebel group with similar aims. MEND reportedly seeks \\"a union of all relevant militant groups in the Niger Delta.\\" However, the identity of MEND is somewhat obscure since its leaders like to remain faceless and its cause has been taken up by completely unrelated groups inspired by the original MEND, one of which is claiming responsibility for some of the violence that has occurred. However, the original members of MEND (recognized as MEND by the United States government and Chevron security), have claimed that impostors are causing some of the violence that is now occurring. MEND's evolving approach to conducting warfare has been described as \\"open source\\", so called because it is analogous to the decentralized communal development process now prevalent in the software industry, making it extremely quick to innovate and move new technologies and tactics rapidly from cell to cell without the direction of a vulnerable leadership hierarchy. Former United States Air Force \\"counter-terrorism\\" officer, technology analyst, and software entrepreneur, John Robb, in a Wired Magazine interview about the emergence of \\"open source guerrillas\\", alleged that MEND \\"doesn’t even field its own guerillas. They hire their experts and fighters mostly from criminal gangs and tribal warrior cults to do their operations.\\" Timeline of activities=2006 Nine officials for the Italian petrol company Eni SpA were killed when armed members of MEND attacked Eni SpA's security forces in Port Harcourt.

Area code 902 designates one of the 86 original numbering plan areas (NPAs) established in the North American Numbering Plan in October 1947. The number plan area 902 originally consisted of three Maritime provinces, with Newfoundland added shortly after it joined Canada in 1949. New Brunswick, along with Newfoundland, was assigned area code 506 in 1955. Newfoundland (now Newfoundland and Labrador) subsequently received a distinct area code, 709, in early 1962. Area code 782 is an overlay area code for the same numbering plan area, introduced in August 2014, to relieve number exhaustion of 902. The incumbent local exchange carrier in the 902/782 area is Bell Aliant, which was produced from a merger that included Island Telecom Inc. (formerly Island Telephone, but both were informally shortened to Island Tel), Maritime Telephone and Telegraph (MT&T;), New Brunswick Tel (NBTel) and NewTel Communications (NewTel).  Coverage area  The number plan area 902/782 is unusual in that it spans two entire provinces, much like area code 867 is shared by the three Canadian territories: Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. This practice is unique to Canada, although was practiced also in the Caribbean.  Overlay  Canada still uses an inefficient scheme for allocating telephone numbers in which every competing carrier is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers–corresponding to a single three- digit prefix–in every rate centre in which it offers new service and every local interconnect region in which it intends to port existing numbers. While most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers, number pooling is not used as a relief measure; it is not possible to reallocate a number once it has been assigned to a carrier and rate centre. Additionally, the rate centres are typically not amalgamated when the corresponding municipalities disappear. As a result, it is not uncommon for a town like Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (6,761 people, as of 2011) to be allocated 150,000 numbers on various carriers. While only 1.06 million people reside in numbering plan area 902, which provides 7.8 million possible seven-digit telephone numbers, the area code was projected to be exhausted by 2015. The exhaustion may have been staved off had it been possible to reallocate numbers from the provinces' smaller rate centres to Halifax, Sydney and Charlottetown. In October 2012, the relief area code 782 was announced, which overlays the entire 902 area. Ten-digit dialing was mandatory in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island as of November 30, 2014. The decision to implement a bi-provincial overlay may have been unusual, but was made to spare residents in rural areas of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island the burden of having to change numbers. As a result, the 782 area code was introduced on August 23, 2014. A recorded message reminding callers that 10-digit dialling would become mandatory on November 30 was activated on August 23. Exchanges in 782 were made available to telephone service providers on May 30, 2014, with numbers being assigned to customers once 10-digit dialing was activated.

Cricket career A solid right-handed batsman who usually batted in the middle order,Christopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers, Rigby, Adelaide, 1983, p. 290. Maitland Hathorn played first-class cricket for Transvaal from 1897-98 to 1906-07, but most of his first-class matches came on his three tours of England with South Africa in 1901, 1904 and 1907. In the match against Cambridge University in 1901, the South Africans batted first and were 114 for 3 when Hathorn went to the wicket. At the end of the first day he was 203 not out, and the South Africans had scored 519 for 7. Playing \\"the most attractive cricket imaginable\\", he went on to make 239 in five hours. Largely thanks to this innings he topped the South African first-class aggregates and averages on the tour (on which no Tests were played), with 827 runs at an average of 35.95. Hathorn played his first Test in the 1902-03 series against Australia, the first Tests between the two teams. In the drawn First Test he made 45 and 31, but was less effective in the Second and Third, which South Africa lost, although he top-scored in the first innings of the Third Test with 19 of South Africa's total of 85. He was again successful when South Africa toured England in 1904. He scored 1167 runs at an average of 37.64, just behind Louis Tancred in the aggregates. He made three centuries, and in the important match against an England XI at Lord's he contributed 59 and 69 to the South Africans' victory. It was the last time South Africa toured England without playing Tests. In the Test series against England in 1905-06, which South Africa won four to one, Hathorn played in all five matches but achieved little except in the Third Test, when he scored the first century of the series on either side, 102 off 170 balls, and South Africa won by 243 runs. It was South Africa's fourth Test century; the first three had been scored by Jimmy Sinclair.Wisden 1963, pp. 262–63, 272. He was not successful in 1907, South Africa's first Test tour of England, although he played in all three Tests, scoring only 46 runs. Notwithstanding his sporting success, Hathorn did not enjoy robust health. Despite having been seriously ill, he was selected for the tour of Australia in 1910-11, but his illness restricted him to three matches in five months. He retired from cricket straight after the tour. Personal life Hathorn married Ruth Loesius in about 1912. She died of pneumonia in 1915. He died in 1920 aged just 42.

Function The Australia Council (the Council) is the Australian Government's principal arts funding and advisory body. The Council is the national advocate for the arts and its purpose is to champion and invest in Australian arts. This national leadership role is achieved by supporting and building Australia's arts ecology by fostering excellence in the arts and increasing national and international engagement with Australian arts.  History  Australia Council was formed in 1967 by Prime Minister Harold Holt as a body for the public funding of the arts and was given statutory authority in March 1975 by the Australia Council Act. The Council's predecessor, the Australian Council for the Arts was established in 1968 by Prime Minister John Gorton as a division of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Council then incorporated other government projects, such as the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board. It operates in co-ordination with the various state government agencies. The Council's operations were independently reviewed in 2012, and the Australia Council Act 2013 (the Act) commenced on 1 July 2013. Funding cuts (2014-2016) In early 2014 federal Arts Minister George Brandis and Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull told artists at the Sydney Biennale that they were ungrateful and selfish to protest about the role of Transfield in the Nauru immigration detention centre. In December 2014, Brandis withdrew a large portion of literature funding from Australia Council.The Conversation, 16 October 2016, Arts training is an essential part of an innovative nationInDaily, 24 October 2016, No minister, creative arts are not a \\"lifestyle choice\\" In May 2015, Brandis cut $26 million a year for four years from Australia Council arts funding, a third of its arts funding, receiving significant criticism from the arts community. The money was reallocated to a new program, the National Program for Excellence in the Arts (NPEA). NPEA in turn was criticised by many artists and arts organisations for lacking the \\"arms-length\\" funding principles that had applied to the relationship between the government and Australia Council since its inception in the 1970s. These principles have traditionally had bipartisan support. Brandis was criticised previously for giving Melbourne classical music record label Melba Recordings a $275,000 grant outside of the usual funding and peer-assessment processes. Brandis's changes to funding arrangements, including the quarantining of the amount received by Australia's 28 major performing arts companies, were widely seen to disadvantage the small-to-medium arts sector and independent artists. Following Malcolm Turnbull's successful spill of the leadership of the Liberal party in September 2015, Brandis was replaced as arts minister by Mitch Fifield.Sydney Morning Herald, 20 September 2015, Cabinet reshuffle: artists call on new arts minister Mitch Fifield to 'undo the damage' done by George Brandis In November Fifield gave back $8 million a year for four years to Australia Council, changed the NPEA to the Catalyst Fund, and stressed it would have a focus on smaller arts projects. The arts community was not impressed by the changes.Sydney Morning Herald, 20 November 2015, Rebranding Brandis arts fund Catalyst won't kill off National Program for Excellence in the ArtsABC News, 20 February 2016, Australia Council budget cuts blindsided peak arts body's executive, documents show As a result of the reduced funding, Australia Council cancelled project funding rounds for small groups and individuals in 2015 and then cut funding to over 60 arts organisations across the country in May 2016. Small arts organisations such as the Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia (CACSA), Leigh Warren & Dancers and many others were affected, forcing them to contract, merge or make drastic changes to their programs. Other arts-related funding cuts In addition, Education Minister Simon Birmingham indicated in 2016 that the government was considering cutting funding to students who wished to undertake creative arts training, saying that he believed that training in the creative arts was a \\"lifestyle\\" choice which could not lead to a satisfactory career or economic outcome, and that he intended to cut loan support for students undertaking such courses. He would be cutting loans for over 50 arts training programs, including programs in ceramics, photography, dance, acting, animation, design, circus, music, film, fashion and journalism. In October 2016, the education cuts were announced. Of 70 creative arts courses previously eligible for funding, only 13 were now going to be Controversy=Self-insemination grant In May 2020 the Australia Council awarded a $25,000 grant to performance artist Casey Jenkins for a piece titled Immaculate, which \\"would feature a live stream of Jenkins – who hopes to fall pregnant – self- inseminating with donated sperm, while discussing their past experiences with conception\\". Following adverse media coverage, the council suspended the funding hours before the first \\"performance\\" on 19 August, and formally rescinded the grant on 21 September. The council stated that the withdrawal of the grant was not due to negative media coverage, but instead followed legal advice about the organisation's liabilities if pregnancy resulted. Jenkins subsequently said that the council had \\"grossly and insultingly mischaracterised my artwork\\". Writing for Guardian Australia, Ben Eltham said that the council's actions might have a chilling effect on performance art in Australia. Awards , the Australia Council Awards include eight categories for achievement in various types of arts. The Awards were established in or before 1981, and are awarded in early March of each year. Australia Council Fellowships, worth , \\"support creative activity and career development for mid-career and established artists\\". Past fellowship holders include: Hetti Perkins (2018), Lisa Maza (2017), Vicki Couzens (2016), Brenda L Croft (2015) and Reko Rennie (2015). They are awarded in the areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts; community arts and cultural development; dance; emerging and experimental arts; literature; music; theatre; and visual arts. First Nations Arts Awards The annual First Nations Arts Awards ( previously National Indigenous Arts Awards or NIAA), include two categories: *The Dreaming Award, established in 2012, \\"to support an inspirational young artist aged 18-26 years to create a major body of work through mentoring and partnerships\\". Nakkiah Lui won the inaugural award. *The Red Ochre Award, established in 1993, a lifetime award for outstanding lifetime achievement in the arts, is awarded annually to both a male and female recipient. The awards ceremony is held event is held on 27 May each year, on the anniversary of the 1967 referendum. At the event, Indigenous Australians who have been awarded Fellowships (in 2018–2019, Vernon Ah Kee for visual art, and Ali Cobby Eckermann, for literature), and First Nations artists who received Australia Council Awards earlier in the year are also celebrated.

History While the first telephone system was installed in Newfoundland in 1885, domestic long-distance calls within the Dominion of Newfoundland could only be placed on a limited basis in 1921. The first long-distance call from Newfoundland to Canada was made on January 10, 1939, using a shortwave radio link operated by the Canadian Marconi Company in Montréal; shortwave radio also carried calls from St. John's to London, England. After confederation with Canada, the first cross-province long- distance call, St. John's to Port aux Basques, was placed in 1949. At the time of the completion of planning for the original NANP area codes in 1947, no provisions were made to include Newfoundland in the continental numbering plan which later became the North American Numbering Plan. The Newfoundland telephone system was entirely manual and dial telephones came to St. John's in 1948; confederation with the Dominion of Canada was enacted in 1949. Canada's Atlantic provinces, The Maritimes, received the area code 902, which remains in use throughout Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. New Brunswick and Newfoundland were split from 902 to area code 506 in 1955. In 1962, Labrador was split off and combined with Newfoundland to form a new numbering plan area with its own area code 709.http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/areacodes/history.area.splits.2-96 Canadian direct distance dial locations came on-line gradually during the next several years, beginning with the largest cities Toronto and Montreal, in 1958. The area codes served mostly for operator routing purposes until customer dialing of long-distance calls became commonplace in the 1960s. The incumbent local exchange carrier for area code 709 is Bell Aliant, owned by Bell Canada, which was formed in 1999 as a result of a merger that included NewTel Communications (previously Newfoundland Telephone). There had been as many as nine companies in Newfoundland and Labrador up to 1951; NewTel acquired the last independent company in 1988. Area code 709 is expected to be exhausted by 2024, at which point Newfoundland and Labrador will receive an overlay area code and ten-digit dialing will become necessary in the province. Area code 879 has been reserved as the second code for the purpose of this overlay, although the relief has been deferred indefinitely. For now, this and the three other Canadian area codes, 506, 807. and 867 still have not been overlaid, and use seven-digit dialling.

It is soluble white powder administered orally in combination with other antiviral drugs. The drug prevents protease from functioning normally. Consequently, HIV viruses cannot reproduce, causing a decrease in the viral load. Commercially sold indinavir is indinavir anhydrous, which is indinavir with an additional amine in the hydroxyethylene backbone. This enhances its solubility and oral bioavailability, making it easier for users to intake. It was synthetically produced for the purpose of inhibiting the protease in the HIV virus. Currently, it is not recommended for use in HIV/AIDS treatment due to its side effects. Furthermore, it is controversial for many reasons starting from its development to its usage. It was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in 1996.  Medical uses  Indinavir does not cure HIV/AIDS, but it can extend the length of a person's life for several years by slowing the progression of the disease. The type that is widely used and created by Merck is indinavir sulfate. The pills are created from sulfate salts and are sold in dosages of 100, 200, 333, and 400 mg of indinavir. It is normally used as one of the three drugs in a triple-combination therapy for the HIV virus. Commercially available capsules should be stored at 15 - 30 °C. It should be kept in a tight container so that it is kept away from moisture. Therefore, it is advised that users should keep the pills in the manufacturer- provided bottle and do not remove the desiccant. HIV-1 protease in complex with indinavir. PDB entry Indinavir wears off quickly after dosing. Unboosted indinavir requires a very precise dosing of 400 mg every eight hours to thwart HIV from forming drug-resistant mutations, including resistances to other protease inhibitors. Boosted indinavir requires two 400-mg indinavir capsules with 1 to 2 100-mg ritonavir capsules twice a day. In both cases, the drugs must be taken with plenty of water one or two hours after a meal. It is recommended that users drink at least 1.5 liters a day when intaking the drug. Drug users must significantly increase their water intake due to indinavir's low solubility that can cause it to crystallize. There are restrictions on what sorts of food may be eaten concurrently with the unboosted indinavir treatment. Furthermore, it is no longer recommended to use in the United States for initial treatments due to pill burden and risk of kidney stones.  Viral resistance  Many people were skeptical of being too hopeful with indinavir due to previous events that occurred with AZT. Viral resistance to the drug leads to the drug becoming useless since the virus evolves to have cells that are able to resist the protease inhibitor. In order to avoid this as much as possible, it is important for users to consistently take the exact amount of the drug at the allocated times. This fear of viral resistance caused a lot of users to be wary of the drug. Side effects The most common side effects of indinavir include: * Gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) * General malaise and fatigue * Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis (the formation of kidney stones), which sometimes may lead to more severe condition including kidney failure * Metabolic alterations including hyperlipidemia (cholesterol or triglyceride elevations) and hyperglycemia * Alterations in body shape (lipodystrophy), colloquially known as \\"Crix belly\\" * Increased levels of Bilirubin, causing skin and white parts of the eyes to turn yellow * Inhibits urinary nitrous oxide production and may inhibit nitric oxide production. * Renal abnormalities, sterile leukocyturia, and reduced creatinine clearance. * Impairs endothelial function in healthy HIV-negative men and may accelerate atherosclerotic disease.  Chemical properties  Structure of protease and indinavir Indinavir is a white crystalline powder. It is very soluble in water and methanol. Each capsule contains sulfate salt in addition to anhydrous lactose and magnesium stearate. The capsule shell is made of gelatin and titanium dioxide. Its melting point or its temperature of decomposition is 150 - 153 °C at which it starts to emit toxic vapors such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The drug fits inside the protease, stopping it from functioning normally. As a result, structural proteins, resulting from polypeptide products of gag and gag-pol genes, that are necessary for the HIV virions cannot form. Eventually, the viral load decreases because of the lack of reproduction. History The official start to its development started in December 1986 when Merck's president, Edward Scolnick, announced that they would start a comprehensive AIDS research program. They started a laboratory dedicated to AIDS research in West Point, Pennsylvania and placed Emilio Emini in charge of the laboratory. A couple months later on January, 1987, a team of researchers consisting of Emilio Emini, Joel Huff, and Irving Sigal, kickstarted their studies by basing their project off of earlier research on the protease enzyme, renin. They were the ones who started the process of research and development into protease inhibitors and its relation to the virus. Over a year later, in July 1988, Nancy Kohl, Emilio Emini, et al., published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Science about the idea of inhibiting the protease. On February, 1989, Manuela Navia, Paula Fitzgerald, et al., published a paper that showed the three-dimensional structure of HIV's protease enzyme. Other researchers claim that this study helped determine the future trajectory of the development of the inhibitor. After much research, in March, 1990, researchers under Reider received a patent to synthesize part of L-689, 502 compound. These were similar to existing inhibitors. However, it failed safety assessments because of its toxicity. Seeing that the research on their drug was heading in the direction of eventually getting it on the market, Merck made decided to formulate a community advisory board composed of AIDS activists who would help with the development effort of the drug in March 1991. Later on, Merck faced serious backlash from community members who though did not like the pricing and distribution of the drug. In January 1992, researchers synthesized indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), which was assigned compound number L-735,524. They started to test L-735,524 on animals a couple months later and found that it was safe for animals. Consequently, the company decided that it was safe to start human trials on September of the same year. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indinavir on March, 1996, making it the eighth antiretroviral drug approved. It was first given its blessing by the FDA on March 1 then approved merely 42 days after the company filed the drug to the FDA. A major reason for this fast approval was the presentation Merck gave to the committee with results from Study 035 (see below). The fact that they had fast approval ran into trouble with groups like Treatment Action Group who thought that accelerated drug approval was not beneficial for people infected with HIV/AIDS. From then on, indinavir used with dual NRTIs set a new standard for treatment of HIV/AIDS. Protease inhibitors changed the nature of AIDS from a terminal illness to a somewhat manageable one. It significantly increased life expectancies and decreased noticeable symptoms from infectious diseases that were the result of a weakened immune system from the virus. Currently, it is being replaced by newer drugs that are more convenient to take, less likely to promote virus resistance, and less toxic, such as darunavir or atazanavir.  Clinical trials  In January 1996, Merck & Co. proved that indinavir was a clinically efficient drug based on data from human trials. They were able to show that indinavir, when used with two other anti-HIV drugs, could significantly reduce the HIV viral load.  Study 035  The study's goal was to show the different effects of different antiviral treatments. 97 patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: indinavir monotherapy, AZT and lamivudine, or all three agents. Eligible patients were those who received AZT for at least 6 months and have CD4 cell counts between 50 and 400, viral loads of at least 200,000 copies/mL, and had no prior antiretroviral therapy with protease inhibitor or lamivudine. The results of the study showed that the most effective treatment was the three drug treatment. After 24 weeks of treatment, 24 patients of the 28 patients who were treated with the three drugs were able to have viral load levels have less than 500 copies/ml. 12 out of 28 patients under indinavir monotherapy reached 500 copies/ml, and none of the thirty patients in AZT and lamivudine group got below 500 copies.  ACTG 320  This study took a look at clinical efficiency of the different treatments. Patients had to have CD4 cell counts less than 200 and at least 3 months of AZT therapy before the trials. 1156 patients with a mean of 87 CD4 cell counts and mean viral load of 100,000 copies/ml were randomized to one of the two groups: AZT plus lamivudine or AZT plus lamivudine plus indinavir. Just like Study 035, patients couldn't be in the study if they had prior protease inhibitor treatment or lamivudine for more than one week. The end point of the study was death or development of opportunistic infections. After 38 weeks, 6% of the people in the three-drug group died while 11% of the people died in the two-drug group. There were higher CD4 cell counts and less viral load in patients assigned to the three-drug group, proving that a three- drug treatment is more efficient than a two-drug one.  Controversy = Supply  Merck did not have enough time to prepare enough drugs to distribute for all those who were infected. 650,000 to 900,000 people were infected with the virus, and Merck could only provide drugs for about 25,000 to 30,000 people. Furthermore, the drug has to be taken consistently or else users face dangers, meaning that the company has to take into account refills for users who take the drugs. This situation of limited supply caused a lot of activists to be angry at the fact that they were selling in such limited quantities.  Distribution  Because of its limited supply, Merck decided to adopt a single distributor system in which they would send indinavir to only one pharmaceutical retail company. They sold it to Stadtalnder's Pharmacy and limited quantities to Veteran Administration's hospitals and some managed- care organizations. This caused prices to be raised and limited the number of people who could have access to this possibly life-saving drug.  Price  Indinavir cost about $12 for a daily dose, which is 24% less than Invirase and 33% less than Norvir. Because the company used a single distributor system to sell their drugs, the retail price was marked up 37% by the pharmacy that sold it. In response to this hefty price, Merck stated that it cost a lot to research and develop the drug, and they did not have enough supplies to sell it through a normal distributor system. Activists protested against this price because it made it harder for people to have access to the drug.

She was named for Commodore Thomas Truxtun, and was an active participant in the Mexican–American War.  The ship  Truxtun was laid down in late December 1841 at Portsmouth, Virginia, by the Norfolk Navy Yard, launched on 16 April 1842; and commissioned on 18 February 1843, Lieutenant George P. Upshur in command.  Prewar history  On 16 June, Truxtun stood out of Hampton Roads for her first cruise. The brig reached Gibraltar on 9 July, received a visit from the American consul on the 16th, and sailed on the 18th to continue her cruise. On 26 July, she hove into sight of Majorca and, the following day, dropped anchor in Port Mahon. She remained there until 28 August when she resumed her cruise. During the ensuing month, the brig proceeded to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and visited several Aegean ports before putting into Constantinople on 29 September. There, she conducted several missions for the American chargé d'affaires before departing the Levant late in October. Sailing via Port Mahon again, Truxtun left the Mediterranean in mid-November and headed for Norfolk, Virginia where she arrived on 28 December. In mid- January 1844 she moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was decommissioned on 6 February. On 13 June 1844, Truxtun was placed back in commission, Commander Henry Bruce in command. Two weeks later, she sailed down the Delaware River and passed between the capes into the Atlantic. After visiting Funchal, Madeira, the warship joined the African patrol. She took up station off Tenerife in the Canary Islands to begin duty suppressing the slave trade. For 16 months, Truxtun patrolled off the Atlantic bulge of the African continent. During that time, she visited Monrovia, Liberia; and Sierra Leone as well as the islands of Maio, St. Jago, and St. Vincent. She also took at least one prize, a schooner which was outfitted and taken into the United States Navy as Spitfire. On 30 October 1845, the brig weighed anchor at Monrovia, and she headed west toward the United States. On 23 November, she arrived at the Gosport Navy Yard where she was decommissioned once again on 28 November 1845.  Mexican–American War service  In mid-May 1846, war broke out between the United States and Mexico. Truxtun was recommissioned at Norfolk on 8 June under the command of Lt. Edward Weston Carpender. On the 15th, she passed El Morro castle and anchored in Havana harbor, Cuba. For the next six weeks, the brig operated off the coast of Cuba. On 2 August, the warship cleared Havana and, on the 9th, joined the blockading American fleet just off the Mexican coast at Sacrificios Island. On the 12th, Lt. Carpender received orders instructing him to relieve sloop of war John Adams on station off Tampico. Early in the evening on 14 August, the brig was heading north in a gale about 100 miles from her destination. She turned in towards land in order to be able to provision ashore the following morning. That maneuver brought her dangerously close to Tuxpan Reef, and she soon ran hard aground. The gale continued to blow and drove her harder upon the reef. Still, her officers and crew tried to free her and declined a Mexican offer to surrender. On the morning of the 15th, she dispatched one of her cutters to the anchorage at Anton Lizardo to seek help. Though stuck fast on the reef, the little warship refused to strike her colors and prosecuted the blockade to the best of her ability. On the 16th, she sighted a sail on the horizon. With the gale still churning the sea, Truxtun dispatched a cutter to investigate the stranger. The boarding party discovered that she was Mexican and promptly seized her. They sailed the prize toward Truxtun in an effort to help the stricken warship but could not get close enough to assist her. Lt. Carpender finally determined that further effort to save his ship would be fruitless. He sent some supplies to the men on board the captured Mexican and ordered them to Anton Lizardo with the prize and with a message indicating his intention to surrender to the Mexicans. After putting the Mexican crew ashore at Tuxpan, the prize headed for Anton Lizardo. En route, she encountered a schooner. A long sea chase ensued; but, late in the evening of the 18th, Truxtun's prize claimed one of her own. With a prize crew of four on board the new captive, the two small ships set off for the American anchorage. Though they became separated in the night, both prizes reached their destination—the first, on the 22nd; and the second, a day later. Meanwhile, St. Mary's had entered Anton Lizardo after having previously picked up the cutter and crew Truxtun had dispatched for help on the 15th. In response to the information given him by St. Mary's, Commodore David Conner, the commander of the Home Squadron, ordered Princeton and Falmouth to Truxtun's aid. Princeton hove into sight of the grounded brig early in the afternoon of the 20th and sent a landing party ashore under a flag of truce. The landing party learned that Lt. Carpender and the remainder of his crew had surrendered three days earlier. The following day, Princeton sent a boarding party to Truxtun; but they did not succeed in getting on board until 22 August. Finding that the Mexicans had already taken most of what was salvageable, they took the rest and set fire to the ship. She burned to the waterline and was subsequently struck from the Navy list.

He was the son of the Revd C. Taberer and was born at a mission station in Keiskammahoek, Cape Province. Career Taberer attended St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, from January 1883 to June 1892. He played in St. Andrew's cricket XI and rugby XV. At Keble College, Oxford, he attained a B.A. (Hon) in Theology. Henry was the brother of Bill Taberer, international rugby player. Taberer represented Oxford University in 1891 and 1892 but did not gain a ‘Blue’, which is awarded to those selected for the annual intervarsity match against Cambridge at Lord’s. The South African Review remarked that ‘favouritism of the grossest kind robbed [Taberer] forever of the great, trebly great, honour of a triple blue’.He also appeared for Essex in 1892 and 1893, before the county achieved first-class status. He appeared for Oxford against Cambridge in both athletics (long jump) and rugby union. Taberer had an intermittent cricket career in South Africa, appearing for Natal, Transvaal and Rhodesia. On his one Test appearance he captained the side, but he scored only two runs and took just one wicket, that of Victor Trumper. The match was his last first-class cricket appearance. He was later prominent in South African cricket administration. Career in colonial administration Taberer was born on a mission station and was a fluent speaker of the languages used by the local population: he claimed to speak them more fluently than he did English. He was able to use this talent effectively when he became manager of the South African government's Native Labour Bureau and adviser to the Native Recruiting Corporation for the Chamber of Mines at a time of increasing industrial unrest. It has been suggested that because of Taberer’s role “it was no surprise, therefore, that the NRC also sponsored the new Native Recruitment Cup played for by provincial African cricket teams, once the earlier ‘Barnato’ competition, which had included cricketers of all ethnic groups, had folded.” Taberer was the Secretary for Zululand in 1894, an acting magistrate in Eshowe, Zululand in 1895. From April 1896 to 1900 he was Controller of Cattle in Southern Rhodesia from April 1896 to 1900; He was also the Chief Native Commissioner in Mashonaland in 1895. He was a captain in the Umtali Volunteer regiment and served through the Mashonaland rebellion (1896–97), he was twice mentioned in despatches. He died at Colesberg, Cape Province in 1932.

Born into a cricketing family in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, Tancred attended St Aidan's College, Grahamstown where, along with his brothers Bernard and Vincent, he began to show cricketing prowess. He made his first-class debut for Transvaal against Western Province on 24 March 1897, scoring 40 and 15. The next season, Tancred starred in the Currie Cup, scoring 120 against Natal and averaging 36.12 for the season, placing him second in the batting averages. His flourishing cricketing career was waylaid by the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War. Tancred served as a trooper with the Western Province Mounted Rifles and awarded the Queen's Medal for bravery. While still serving in the war, Tancred was named in South Africa's touring team to England in 1901 and, after being excused from active service, Tancred joined his team mates on the boat to England. In England he played 16 first-class matches, scoring 591 runs at 21 but failed to play a Test. Tancred eventually made his Test debut against Australia on 11 October 1902 at Johannesburg, scoring 97 and 24. His 97 was the highest score by a South African on Test debut until Andrew Hudson’s 163 against the West Indies in 1992. Following the series against Australia, Tancred was chosen in the 1904 South African touring side to England. While there he heard of the suicide of his brother Vincent, who had reportedly been depressed over his non-selection in the team. Tancred went into seclusion for a few days before returning to the South African side to post some large scores late in the tour, including 250 against Scotland. During the 1904/05 South African season, Tancred became the first player to score 1000 runs in Currie Cup cricket and cemented himself as one of the leading players in the country. The next season, in the First Test at Old Wanderers at Johannesburg, he was a member of the first South African team to defeat England in a Test. In 1907 he was ill, missed the Currie Cup and initially ruled himself out of that year's tour of England but, as one of South Africa's top batsmen, he was selected anyway. He made a pair in his only Test of the tour. In 1912 Tancred played in the Triangular Tournament between England, Australia and South Africa, including three matches as captain in the absence of the injured Frank Mitchell. Tancred averaged only 20.29 during the tour and South Africa lost all three matches he captained. He played his final Test the next season, against England at Johannesburg, making 13 and 20 and finishing with 530 Test runs at an average of 21.20. A dour opening batsman throughout most of his career, Wisden wrote “a feature of his batting is a peculiar crouch … (which is) … anything but graceful” and that Tancred was not a good bowler and “only an average field.” While playing cricket, Tancred worked as the secretary for a range of sporting and social clubs, while anticipating a lucrative post-cricket job as promised by the wealthy businessmen who financed South African cricket in the early years of the twentieth century. This job did not eventuate and Tancred became despondent, more so in 1913 when he was forced to petition for insolvency after endorsing the promissory notes of a fellow cricketer, Frank Dickenson, who promptly disappeared. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Tancred enlisted in the Natal Light Horse but was discharged as being unfit for active service in 1915. His marriage to Mary Chawick later that year produced two children and following a few post War matches Tancred retired from first-class cricket in 1920. It is believed that Tancred became depressed as he struggled to live life out of the limelight that surrounded his cricketing career. His disillusionment was such that Tancred strongly advised his son Louis Jnr not to embark on a career in sport. Louis Jnr instead joined the Royal Air Force and, while working as a flight instructor, was killed aged 34 in a plane crash at the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire. Tancred died in Parktown, Transvaal.

As a former specialist in Celtic studies at the Sorbonne, he researched pre-Christian and medieval culture and spirituality. He published numerous books about Celtic civilization, particularly the place of women in Celtic culture, and Arthurian literature. Works His many works deal with subjects as varied as summations of various myths, their relationships with subjects like the Templars, the Cathars and the Rennes le Château mystery, Atlantis, the megalith building civilisations, Druidism and the biography of Saint Columba. *The Celts: Uncovering the Mythic and Historic Origins of Western Culture () *Montségur and the Mystery of the Cathars () *Women of the Celts (1972) *The Druids: Celtic Priests of Nature () *Cathedral of the Black Madonna: The Druids and the Mysteries of Chartres *King of the Celts: Arthurian Legends and Celtic Tradition *Merlin: Priest of Nature *The Epics of Celtic Ireland: Ancient Tales of Mystery and Magic *The Great Goddess: Reverence Of The Divine Feminine From The Paleolithic To The Present *The Church of Mary Magdalene: The Sacred Feminine and the Treasure of Rennes-le-Chateau Controversy While Markale presents himself as widely read on the subjects about which he writes, the value of his work is controversial. His 'creative' use of scholarship and his tendency to make great leaps in reasoning cause scholars following more normative and conservative methods to balk and his interest in subjects that his critics consider questionable, including various branches of the occult, have gained him at least as many detractors as admirers. Another source of controversy is his use of Carl Jung's concept of \\"collective unconscious\\" as an explanatory device, since the vast majority of psychologists outside Jungian depth psychology do not accept the concept. His already weakened reputation was further tarnished in 1989, when he became involved in a plagiarism case after he published under his own name a serious and well-documented guide to the oddities and antiquities of Brittany, the text of which had already been published, twenty years before by a different writer, through the very same publisher. The Breton scholar Christian-Joseph Guyonvarc'h dismissed Markale as follows; \\"Mr Jean Bertrand, a.k.a. Jean Markale, styles himself as a professor of classical literature. He never says where he teaches; but [...] he cannot properly accentuate Greek, knows nothing of Latin [...] he doesn't know how many cases there are in Irish declension (sometimes he says two, at other times three) [...] Jean Markale very complacently quotes his own works in his later publications and, every time an Irish text is mentioned, he refers the reader to his 'Celtic Epics' as though that book included actual translations or constituted the most basic and essential reference on the matter.

Relatively few examples were ever built. Of the three built in the US, two remain, the Ashfork-Bainbridge Steel Dam, built in 1898 in the Arizona desert to supply locomotive water to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF), and the Redridge Steel Dam, built 1901, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to supply water to stamp mills. The third, the Hauser Lake Dam in Montana, was finished in 1907 but failed in 1908. Steel dams were found uneconomical after World War I as the steel prices raised many times compared to cement prices though they are equally sound like other dam building materials. Their economics are highly favourable in 21st century due to lower total onsite labour costs, lower cost for bulk material transportation, availability of more construction time in a year, and flexibility in construction plan complying statuary requirements, etc. Principles of operation  Downstream side of Redridge Steel Dam Steel dams use a series of footings anchored in the earth. These footings hold struts which in turn hold up a series of deck girders which in turn hold steel plates. It is these plates that the water comes in contact with. The girders and plates are angled in the downstream direction so that part of the weight of the water acts with a downward force on the struts and footings, holding them in place. If the plates were vertical, as in a steel cofferdam, all the force would be horizontal and much more massive struts and anchors would be required to counteract the horizontal force and bending moment. Direct strutted Cross section of a steel dam with direct struts In the direct strutted version, shown in the illustration at left, all the struts are parallel. There is thus no tensile force in the plate girders. Cantilever strutted Cross section of a steel dam with cantilever struts In the cantilever strutted version, shown in the illustration at left, the top strut (or struts, depending on design) can be fashioned into a cantilever truss. By all going to the same footing, the upper part of the deck girders are thus in tension and the moment of the cantilever section is offset by the moment of the water impinging on that section. Scalloping In both types of construction, it is typical for the plates to have a scalloped appearance, as can be seen in the Redridge Steel Dam illustration, above. It is to allow free expansion/contraction of the steel plates as the water or ambient temperature changes. Design tradeoffs There are two design trade-offs, the girder plate angle and the strut angle. Increasing the girder/plate angle towards the horizontal, the normal component of the force will increase towards vertical; this means that footings do not need to resist as much horizontal force, but requires more steel for a given upstream head. Increasing the strut angle towards vertical reduces the horizontal moment on the footings, reducing the risk of sliding. Spillways and pipes Steel dams may or may not have a spillway. The Ashfork-Bainbridge did not have one but was designed to allow water to pour directly over the crest, while the Redridge had both a spillway and a water pipe to supply water to downstream stamp mills. Advantages and disadvantages Steel Dam proponents claimed some advantages: *Steel fabrication techniques, even at the turn of the 19th century, allowed for faster and cheaper construction than masonry *The structure is statically determinate allowing precise calculations of load and member strength needed *Since steel is more flexible than concrete, they are more resistant to catastrophic failure due to ground settling *Frost does not affect them the way it does concrete or masonry *Non-catastrophic leaks can be addressed by welding There were also some known disadvantages: *Constructing good footings is key to a successful dam as they must bear weight, not settle too much and resist horizontal travel. *The long term strength of the dam is not known. The two examples in the US still standing are not currently under significant water load *The lightness of the structure means it is more vulnerable to wear due to water vibrations than more massive dams *Maintenance needs are higher, rust and corrosion must be addressed *Stresses can be quite concentrated, which could cause stress cracking as a failure mode. *As with other dams, undermining is a possible failure mode (this is believed to be why the Hauser Lake dam failed.)

In contrast, conventional electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes monitor this activity from outside the skull. ECoG may be performed either in the operating room during surgery (intraoperative ECoG) or outside of surgery (extraoperative ECoG). Because a craniotomy (a surgical incision into the skull) is required to implant the electrode grid, ECoG is an invasive procedure.  History  ECoG was pioneered in the early 1950s by Wilder Penfield and Herbert Jasper, neurosurgeons at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The two developed ECoG as part of their groundbreaking Montreal procedure, a surgical protocol used to treat patients with severe epilepsy. The cortical potentials recorded by ECoG were used to identify epileptogenic zones – regions of the cortex that generate epileptic seizures. These zones would then be surgically removed from the cortex during resectioning, thus destroying the brain tissue where epileptic seizures had originated. Penfield and Jasper also used electrical stimulation during ECoG recordings in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery under local anesthesia. This procedure was used to explore the functional anatomy of the brain, mapping speech areas and identifying the somatosensory and somatomotor cortex areas to be excluded from surgical removal. A doctor named Robert Galbraith Heath was also an early researcher of the brain at the Tulane University School of Medicine.  Electrophysiological basis  ECoG signals are composed of synchronized postsynaptic potentials (local field potentials), recorded directly from the exposed surface of the cortex. The potentials occur primarily in cortical pyramidal cells, and thus must be conducted through several layers of the cerebral cortex, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pia mater, and arachnoid mater before reaching subdural recording electrodes placed just below the dura mater (outer cranial membrane). However, to reach the scalp electrodes of a conventional electroencephalogram (EEG), electrical signals must also be conducted through the skull, where potentials rapidly attenuate due to the low conductivity of bone. For this reason, the spatial resolution of ECoG is much higher than EEG, a critical imaging advantage for presurgical planning. ECoG offers a temporal resolution of approximately 5 ms and a spatial resolution of 1 cm. Using depth electrodes, the local field potential gives a measure of a neural population in a sphere with a radius of 0.5–3 mm around the tip of the electrode. With a sufficiently high sampling rate (more than about 10 kHz), depth electrodes can also measure action potentials. In which case the spatial resolution is down to individual neurons, and the field of view of an individual electrode is approximately 0.05-0.35 mm.  Procedure  The ECoG recording is performed from electrodes placed on the exposed cortex. In order to access the cortex, a surgeon must first perform a craniotomy, removing a part of the skull to expose the brain surface. This procedure may be performed either under general anesthesia or under local anesthesia if patient interaction is required for functional cortical mapping. Electrodes are then surgically implanted on the surface of the cortex, with placement guided by the results of preoperative EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Electrodes may either be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural). ECoG electrode arrays typically consist of sixteen sterile, disposable stainless steel, carbon tip, platinum, Platinum-iridium alloy or gold ball electrodes, each mounted on a ball and socket joint for ease in positioning. These electrodes are attached to an overlying frame in a “crown” or “halo” configuration. Subdural strip and grid electrodes are also widely used in various dimensions, having anywhere from 4 to 256 electrode contacts. The grids are transparent, flexible, and numbered at each electrode contact. Standard spacing between grid electrodes is 1 cm; individual electrodes are typically 5 mm in diameter. The electrodes sit lightly on the cortical surface, and are designed with enough flexibility to ensure that normal movements of the brain do not cause injury. A key advantage of strip and grid electrode arrays is that they may be slid underneath the dura mater into cortical regions not exposed by the craniotomy. Strip electrodes and crown arrays may be used in any combination desired. Depth electrodes may also be used to record activity from deeper structures such as the hippocampus.  DCES  Direct cortical electrical stimulation (DCES), also known as cortical stimulation mapping, is frequently performed in concurrence with ECoG recording for functional mapping of the cortex and identification of critical cortical structures. When using a crown configuration, a handheld wand bipolar stimulator may be used at any location along the electrode array. However, when using a subdural strip, stimulation must be applied between pairs of adjacent electrodes due to the nonconductive material connecting the electrodes on the grid. Electrical stimulating currents applied to the cortex are relatively low, between 2 and 4 mA for somatosensory stimulation, and near 15 mA for cognitive stimulation. The stimulation frequency is usually 60 Hz in North America and 50 Hz in Europe, and any charge density more than 150 μC/cm2 causes tissue damage.\\"Electrical Stimulation Mapping of the Brain: Basic Principles and Emerging Alternatives\\" Authors Anthony L. Ritaccio, Peter Brunner, and Gerwin Schalk. Publisher Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology Volume 35, Number 2. Date March 2018. \\"frequency\\" on page 6 of 12, \\"damage\\" on page 3 of 12 The functions most commonly mapped through DCES are primary motor, primary sensory, and language. The patient must be alert and interactive for mapping procedures, though patient involvement varies with each mapping procedure. Language mapping may involve naming, reading aloud, repetition, and oral comprehension; somatosensory mapping requires that the patient describe sensations experienced across the face and extremities as the surgeon stimulates different cortical regions.  Clinical applications  Since its development in the 1950s, ECoG has been used to localize epileptogenic zones during presurgical planning, map out cortical functions, and to predict the success of epileptic surgical resectioning. ECoG offers several advantages over alternative diagnostic modalities: * Flexible placement of recording and stimulating electrodes * Can be performed at any stage before, during, and after a surgery * Allows for direct electrical stimulation of the brain, identifying critical regions of the cortex to be avoided during surgery * Greater precision and sensitivity than an EEG scalp recording - spatial resolution is higher and signal-to-noise ratio is superior due to closer proximity to neural activity Limitations of ECoG include: * Limited sampling time – seizures (ictal events) may not be recorded during the ECoG recording period * Limited field of view – electrode placement is limited by the area of exposed cortex and surgery time, sampling errors may occur * Recording is subject to the influence of anesthetics, narcotic analgesics, and the surgery itself  Intractable epilepsy  Epilepsy is currently ranked as the third most commonly diagnosed neurological disorder, afflicting approximately 2.5 million people in the United States alone. Epileptic seizures are chronic and unrelated to any immediately treatable causes, such as toxins or infectious diseases, and may vary widely based on etiology, clinical symptoms, and site of origin within the brain. For patients with intractable epilepsy – epilepsy that is unresponsive to anticonvulsants – surgical treatment may be a viable treatment option. ;Extraoperative ECoG Before a patient can be identified as a candidate for resectioning surgery, MRI must be performed to demonstrate the presence of a structural lesion within the cortex, supported by EEG evidence of epileptogenic tissue. Once a lesion has been identified, ECoG may be performed to determine the location and extent of the lesion and surrounding irritative region. The scalp EEG, while a valuable diagnostic tool, lacks the precision necessary to localize the epileptogenic region. ECoG is considered to be the gold standard for assessing neuronal activity in patients with epilepsy, and is widely used for presurgical planning to guide surgical resection of the lesion and epileptogenic zone. The success of the surgery depends on accurate localization and removal of the epileptogenic zone. ECoG data is assessed with regard to ictal spike activity – “diffuse fast wave activity” recorded during a seizure – and interictal epileptiform activity (IEA), brief bursts of neuronal activity recorded between epileptic events. ECoG is also performed following the resectioning surgery to detect any remaining epileptiform activity, and to determine the success of the surgery. Residual spikes on the ECoG, unaltered by the resection, indicate poor seizure control, and incomplete neutralization of the epileptogenic cortical zone. Additional surgery may be necessary to completely eradicate seizure activity. Extraoperative ECoG is also used to localize functionally-important areas (also known as eloquent cortex) to be preserved during epilepsy surgery. Motor, sensory, cognitive tasks during extraoperative ECoG are reported to increase the amplitude of high-frequency activity at 70–110 Hz in areas involved in execution of given tasks. Task-related high-frequency activity can animate ‘when’ and ‘where’ cerebral cortex is activated and inhibited in a 4D manner with a temporal resolution of 10 milliseconds or below and a spatial resolution of 10 mm or below. ;Intraoperative ECoG The objective of the resectioning surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue without causing unacceptable neurological consequences. In addition to identifying and localizing the extent of epileptogenic zones, ECoG used in conjunction with DCES is also a valuable tool for functional cortical mapping. It is vital to precisely localize critical brain structures, identifying which regions the surgeon must spare during resectioning (the “eloquent cortex”) in order to preserve sensory processing, motor coordination, and speech. Functional mapping requires that the patient be able to interact with the surgeon, and thus is performed under local rather than general anesthesia. Electrical stimulation using cortical and acute depth electrodes is used to probe distinct regions of the cortex in order to identify centers of speech, somatosensory integration, and somatomotor processing. During the resectioning surgery, intraoperative ECoG may also be performed to monitor the epileptic activity of the tissue and ensure that the entire epileptogenic zone is resectioned. Although the use of extraoperative and intraoperative ECoG in resectioning surgery has been an accepted clinical practice for several decades, recent studies have shown that the usefulness of this technique may vary based on the type of epilepsy a patient exhibits. Kuruvilla and Flink reported that while intraoperative ECoG plays a critical role in tailored temporal lobectomies, in multiple subpial transections (MST), and in the removal of malformations of cortical development (MCDs), it has been found impractical in standard resection of medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). A study performed by Wennberg, Quesney, and Rasmussen demonstrated the presurgical significance of ECoG in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) cases. Research applications ECoG has recently emerged as a promising recording technique for use in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). BCIs are direct neural interfaces that provide control of prosthetic, electronic, or communication devices via direct use of the individual’s brain signals. Brain signals may be recorded either invasively, with recording devices implanted directly into the cortex, or noninvasively, using EEG scalp electrodes. ECoG serves to provide a partially invasive compromise between the two modalities – while ECoG does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier like invasive recording devices, it features a higher spatial resolution and higher signal-to-noise ratio than EEG. ECoG has gained attention recently for decoding imagined speech or music, which could lead to \\"literal\\" BCIs in which users simply imagine words, sentences, or music that the BCI can directly interpret. In addition to clinical applications to localize functional regions to support neurosurgery, real-time functional brain mapping with ECoG has gained attention to support research into fundamental questions in neuroscience. For example, a 2017 study explored regions within face and color processing areas and found that these subregions made highly specific contributions to different aspects of vision. Another study found that high-frequency activity from 70–200 Hz reflected processes associated with both transient and sustained decision-making. Other work based on ECoG presented a new approach to interpreting brain activity, suggesting that both power and phase jointly influence instantaneous voltage potential, which directly regulates cortical excitability. Like the work toward decoding imagined speech and music, these research directions involving real-time functional brain mapping also have implications for clinical practice, including both neurosurgery and BCI systems. The system that was used in most of these real-time functional mapping publications, has been used for both research and clinical applications. Recent advances in ECoG technology The electrocorticogram is still considered to be the \\"gold standard\\" for defining epileptogenic zones; however, this procedure is risky and highly invasive. Recent studies have explored the development of a noninvasive cortical imaging technique for presurgical planning that may provide similar information and resolution of the invasive ECoG. In one novel approach, Lei Ding et al. seek to integrate the information provided by a structural MRI and scalp EEG to provide a noninvasive alternative to ECoG. This study investigated a high- resolution subspace source localization approach, FINE (first principle vectors) to image the locations and estimate the extents of current sources from the scalp EEG. A thresholding technique was applied to the resulting tomography of subspace correlation values in order to identify epileptogenic sources. This method was tested in three pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, with encouraging clinical results. Each patient was evaluated using structural MRI, long-term video EEG monitoring with scalp electrodes, and subsequently with subdural electrodes. The ECoG data were then recorded from implanted subdural electrode grids placed directly on the surface of the cortex. MRI and computed tomography images were also obtained for each subject. The epileptogenic zones identified from preoperative EEG data were validated by observations from postoperative ECoG data in all three patients. These preliminary results suggest that it is possible to direct surgical planning and locate epileptogenic zones noninvasively using the described imaging and integrating methods. EEG findings were further validated by the surgical outcomes of all three patients. After surgical resectioning, two patients are seizure-free and the third has experienced a significant reduction in seizures. Due to its clinical success, FINE offers a promising alternative to preoperative ECoG, providing information about both the location and extent of epileptogenic sources through a noninvasive imaging procedure.

It was previously known as Allegany Community College (or ACC).  History  Allegany College of Maryland began operations in 1961 as \\"Allegany Community College\\" in an old public school facility (the segregationist era all-black Carver Community School) that had been closed in 1959 by the Allegany County Board of Education following the integration of public schools in 1955. The College opened with an enrollment of 122 students from Allegany County under the direction of ACM’s first president, Dr. Robert S. Zimmer. In 1969, the College moved to a new campus consisting of seven buildings on a 316-acre (1.3 km²) tract in suburban Cumberland that was partially funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Enrollment reached the 1000 mark in credit programs during the first year on the new campus and community service and continuing education courses and programs began. Since that time, the campus has expanded to include 15 buildings, which provide modern facilities for both credit and non-credit students. The College opened two Pennsylvania campuses in 1989 (Somerset County Campus in Somerset, Pennsylvania) and 1990 (Bedford County Campus in Everett, Pennsylvania). It expanded its Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts programs into the Gateway Center located in downtown Cumberland in 2002. The College now serves over 3,700 credit students and over 15,000 continuing education registrations. Over 1,000 of these credit students are served at the Pennsylvania campuses. On January 17, 2017 it was announced that the Somerset location will close following the Spring 2017 semester.  Programs  Allegany College bell tower The College offers over 53 associate degrees, 23 certificates, and 21 letters of recognition.  Athletics  The College's men's baseball and basketball teams have been consistently ranked in the top 20 of their respective National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Divisions. The baseball team participated in the NJCAA national tournaments nine times, including a four- year run from 1994-1997. The men's basketball team has participated twelve times in the NJCAA national tournament in 1995-96 (finished 2nd), 1997–98, 2000–01 (finished 2nd), 2001–02, 2003–04 and 2007–08.  Governance and accreditation  The Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) oversees and coordinates higher education in the State of Maryland including academic and financial policies at the College. An eight-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the Governor of the State of Maryland, governs the College. The College also has an advisory board for each of its two Pennsylvania Campuses—the Bedford County Campus Advisory Committee (Bedford County, Pennsylvania) and the Somerset County Campus Advisory Committee (Somerset County, Pennsylvania). The college is a member of the Maryland Association of Community Colleges (MACC) and is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The College is also accredited and approved for operation by MHEC. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has granted certification to Allegany College of Maryland campuses in Bedford and Somerset counties and to the academic programs they offer.

Cox is the only surviving musician to have regularly played with Hendrix: first with the experimental group that backed Hendrix at Woodstock (informally referred to as \\"Gypsy Sun and Rainbows\\"), followed by the trio with drummer Buddy Miles that recorded the live Band of Gypsys album, and, lastly, The Cry of Love Tour trio with Mitch Mitchell back on drums. Cox continues to perform dates with the Band of Gypsys Experience and the Experience Hendrix Tour. In addition to Hendrix, he has either been a member of the house or touring band or recorded sessions for Sam Cooke, Slim Harpo, Joe Simon, Charlie Daniels, John McLaughlin, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Lou Rawls, Etta James, Jackie Wilson and Little Richard. Early years Born in Wheeling, West Virginia, Billy Cox was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended Schenley High School. Cox met Jimi Hendrix when they were serving in the Army at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in 1961. While using the bathroom at Service Club No. 1 during a sudden rainstorm, he heard guitar playing inside. Impressed with what he heard, he introduced himself, told Hendrix he played bass, and they were jamming soon after. They became, and remained, fast friends. They left the military around the same time and they played clubs around Clarksville, Tennessee, finally moving to Nashville. They formed a group called the King Kasuals. They played at Nashville clubs, mostly the Del Morocco, and occasional outlying gigs in the southeast, once as far north as Indianapolis playing what was called the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\". Cox and Hendrix also played in the backing band for Marion James around this time. Hendrix eventually left Nashville, playing all over the U.S. in the backing groups of several famous artists (most notably Little Richard and the Isley Brothers) until he was \\"discovered\\" by Chas Chandler in New York City's Greenwich Village. Chandler took Hendrix to England, but before Hendrix left, he called Cox and asked him to join him. As Cox \\"only had three strings on [his] bass\\" and no money to travel to New York, he simply thanked Hendrix and wished him well. During this period, Cox played bass on such pioneering R&B; television shows as Nashville's \\"Night Train\\" and \\"The!!!! Beat\\" from Dallas, Texas, working closely with Hoss Allen and John Richbourg of WLAC Radio. With Jimi Hendrix In 1969, several months before bassist Noel Redding left the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix called his old friend Cox, who joined him in New York as his studio bassist. Following the break-up of the Experience, Cox performed with Hendrix's experimental group, informally called Gypsy Sun and Rainbows. This group played at Woodstock and two low-key New York gigs. Hendrix then formed another short-lived group with Cox and Buddy Miles, that recorded Band of Gypsys, the live album that he owed former manager Ed Chalpin as part of a legal settlement. Following their demise, Cox recorded and toured with Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell for The Cry of Love Tour, when promoters sometimes billed them as the \\"Jimi Hendrix Experience\\". Cox contributed most of the bass parts on the first group of posthumously released Hendrix albums, including The Cry of Love (1971), Rainbow Bridge (1971), War Heroes (1972), and Loose Ends (1974). Most of the tracks from these albums were consolidated as First Rays of the New Rising Sun (1997), which is the most complete attempt to present Hendrix's fourth studio album (see Hendrix's posthumous discography and videography for a complete list). Additionally, Cox appears on many live albums and films from the Cry of Love Tour. After Hendrix's death=1970s–1980s In 1971, Cox released his album Nitro Function with Char Vinnedge (from Luv'd Ones) and Robert Tarrant. Cox played with others, including the Charlie Daniels Band, as well as session work and live dates. Throughout the '70s and '80s, Cox would continue to be a part of Jimi's music as posthumous releases continued to pour out. 1990s In 1995, Cox along with Mitchell, Redding and Miles began participating in Hendrix tributes and tours. In 1999, Cox appeared on the late Bruce Cameron's album, Midnight Daydream, that included other Hendrix alumni Mitchell and Miles along with Jack Bruce and others. Cox has also performed some dates along with Mitchell and guitarist Gary Serkin with a Hendrix-tribute outfit called the Gypsy Sun Experience. Cox worked on First Rays of the New Rising Sun, Hendrix's fourth studio album, which was cut off by Hendrix's death. Cox has also been known to guest speak at University level music seminars. In this capacity he has been helpful to the aspiring musicians by spending time with them in discussion and demonstration sessions. This spirit of sharing and helping other musicians is similar to his former bandleader Hendrix's vision of providing musicians with a no-pressure (including cost breaks if needed) recording environment in the now legendary Electric Lady studios located in Greenwich Village. 2000s In 2004, Miles reunited yet again with Cox of the Band of Gypsys to re-record songs from the original live album of 1970 with guitarists Eric Gales, Kenny Olsen, Sheldon Reynolds, Andy Aledort and Gary Serkin. The album, titled The Band Of Gypsys Return, was released in 2006. Cox currently plays with the Experience Hendrix, a semi-regular touring Hendrix tribute band featuring top guitarists and former Hendrix collaborators. Cox's solo album Last Gypsy Standing was released in 2009. In 2009, he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. 2010s Today, Billy Cox owns a video production company. He has produced numerous blues and a myriad of gospel shows. He co-authored the books Jimi Hendrix Sessions and Ultimate Hendrix with John McDermott and Eddie Kramer. Cox has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including these: In 2009 he was inducted into The Musicians Hall of Fame; he received the Founders Award in 2010, given by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. In 2011, Cox was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall Of Fame. He released Old School Blue Blues in 2011, and continues to tour with \\"The Experience Hendrix Tour\\" each year and his own Band of Gypsys Experience. He released the single \\"Run\\" featuring the androgynous singer and songwriter Marlon Alarm in November 2011, and his latest release, Unfiltered, came out in late 2014. On June 23, 2019, Cox was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame along with his band mates, Hendrix and Miles for their groundbreaking work as the Band of Gypsys. Cox was on hand to accept the award in Detroit, Michigan, and performed with guitarist Dani Robinson and drummer Richie Monica.

Life and career Thornton was born in Skipton, Yorkshire, England. He was educated at Skipton Grammar School, and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine. Thornton occasionally played for Yorkshire and Middlesex before going to South Africa when the South African Wars broke out. Thornton was one of the first to volunteer, and was appointed head of the Government Hospital in Pretoria. Thornton spent nine years in South Africa and, during his stay, he played cricket for Transvaal, and for South Africa at the Old Wanderers, Johannesburg. This was in the first Test match that Australia played in South Africa in October 1902, when the Australian side, led by Joe Darling, were on their way home from their tour of England. A left-handed batsman and bowler, Thornton peaked in 1895 when for Middlesex he averaged 31.00 with the bat, and took 23 wickets. He triumphed with the ball against Gloucestershire at Lord's. The fifth bowler used, he bowled W. G. Grace, who had scored 169, and in the last innings of the match took all five wickets that fell, finishing with a match return of nine wickets for 72. In the corresponding fixture the next season, Thornton recorded his highest first- class score of 161, as Middlesex won by an innings and 77 runs. However, in that match, he was not used as a bowler.
