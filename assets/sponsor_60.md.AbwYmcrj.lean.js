The locality is mountainous being part of the Great Dividing Range. There are numerous named peaks. The ridge of the Great Dividing Range passes through the west of the locality. This creates a watershed. Creeks which rise in the north-east of the locality flow north (Gunnawarra) and contribute eventually to the Herbert River which flows into the Hinchinbrook Channel at Macknade/Lucinda in the Shire of Hinchinbrook. Creeks which rise in the south-west are tributaries of the Burdekin which flows into the Coral Sea at Rita Island in the Shire of Burdekin. Meanwhile the north-west of the locality contributes to the Mitchell River and the south-west to the Gilbert River, both of which flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria at Kowanyama (Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama) and Howitt/Yagoonga (Shire of Carpentaria) respectively.

Following World War II, the committee received its ultimate title and began organizing public demonstrations of Japanese American loyalty. These demonstrations included war bond rallies, blood drives, and art exhibitions. A number of its members also volunteered for the Foreign Language Division of the Office of War Information as translators or writers. JACD originally had a mixed Issei-Nisei membership and limited its activities to New York City. However, by the mid-1940s, the JACD had transformed itself into a mass Nisei-based organization that urged political action nationwide. By the end of 1944, all Issei board members were asked to resign.After Camp: Portraits in Midcentury Japanese American Life and Politics By Greg Robinson Page 183-190 Despite the organization's apparent focus, its information discussed a variety of topics.

It is south-west of Innisfail. Geography Cardstone is a long thin locality following the valley of the Tully River. The northern part of the locality is mostly bushland, but the southern part is farming land. Cardstone village was built near the Tully River to accommodate workers and families of the Kareeya Hydro Power Station. The village and was less than in area. Cardstone was mostly surrounded by the rainforest of the Tully Gorge National Park which forms part of the World Heritage-listed Wet Tropics of Queensland. History Construction of the Kareeya Hydro Power Station on the Tully River commenced in 1952 and the power station commenced operation in 1957. The staff and families were provided accommodation in a small village called Cardstone located about downstream from the plant. The power station was instigated jointly by the Cardwell Shire Council and the Johnstone Shire Council and the name Cardstone is an amalgamation of those two names. Although it was desired to have a post office in Cardstone in 1954, no local person could be found to carry out the duties. Cardstone Post Office did not open until 11 January 1955. It closed in 1990 when the village closed. Cardstone State School opened on 18 February 1957. From 1959 to 1967 it was downgraded to a Provisional School and was closed on 14 December 1990 when the village closed. During Cyclone Winifred in late January 1986, rainfall of was measured at Cardstone along the Tully River In about 1990, the power station became fully automated and could be operated from Townsville, making many of the Cardstone operating staff redundant. As only a small number of maintenance workers would be required to visit the station, it was decided to close down the village and relocate the maintenance workers to Tully. As the area was in the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage site, the village's buildings, then comprising 29 homes, a single men's barracks, a school and a post office, were sold for relocation. All evidence of the village was bulldozed and the site was replanted with local native species so that it would revert to its natural state. Mature coconut palms and pine trees grown at the village were chopped down during the environmental rehabilitation as they were not local species. There had been a proposal that the village be retained and used as tourist accommodation, but the Cardwell Shire Council opposed the idea believing it would not be cost-effective.

The design differed significantly from previous Voisin designs in eliminating the forward-mounted elevator. Design and development The Type Bordeaux was a two-bay equal span pusher configuration biplane powered by a Gnome Omega 7 cylinder rotary engine driving an aluminium bladed Voisin propeller mounted at the rear of the uncovered wooden nacelle. The tail surfaces, carried on four wire-braced steel booms, consisted of a horizontal stabiliser and elevator mounted between the upper pair of booms with a single centrally mounted rudder beneath it. The structure made extensive use of steel tubing and the flying surfaces were covered with \\"Continental\\" brand rubberised fabric. Lateral control was effected by large D-shaped ailerons mounted on the upper wing: these were controlled by foot pedals. The rudder and elevator were activated by a control wheel which was turned to control the rudder and moved forwards and backwards to control the elevator. It had a tricycle undercarriage consisting of a pair of mainwheels mounted on sprung steel struts below the wing and a nosewheel below the front of the nacelle, although the aircraft at rest rested on the two mainwheels and skids mounted at the rear of the lower pair of tailbooms. The type became famous after a flight between Paris and Bordeaux made in September 1910 by Juan Bielovucic, who intended to compete in an aviation meet being held in Bordeaux and flew there from Paris in order to save the expense of sending the aircraft by rail. The flight was made in four stages (Paris‚ÄìOrl√©ans, Orl√©ans‚ÄìCh√¢tellerault, Ch√¢tellerault‚ÄìAngoul√™me and Angoul√™me‚ÄìBordeaux) spread over three days, in a total flying time of 6 hrs. 15 mins. This set a new record for cross-country flight, and Bielovucic was given a medal by the Bordeaux Departmental Assembly. The design was later refined to become the two-seat 1911 Voisin Type de Tourism.

The spelling Miriwinni has also been used historically, but Mirriwinni is the official spelling from 8 October 2010. In the , Mirriwinni had a population of 447 people.  Geography  Town of Mirriwinni on the Bruce Highway, 2018 The town is south of the centre of the locality. The Russell River forms the eastern and south-eastern boundary, while Babinda Creek forms part of the northern boundary. The foothills of Mount Bartle Frere form the western boundary. Most of the land in the locality is flat low-lying land (approx 10 metres above sea level) and is used for farming, predominantly growing sugarcane. However, in the western edge of the locality, the land rises to up to 150 metres above sea level heading towards the peaks of Mount Bartle Frere in the adjacent locality of Wooroonooran. The Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway line traverse the locality from south to west, both passing through the town, but there is no railway station in the locality. There is however a network of sugarcane tramways that supports the local cane farmers. History Homestead among the cane fields, 2018 The town takes its name from the railway station name, first used by the Queensland Railways Department on 18 February 1915, reportedly an Aboriginal word meaning mountain rock. Miriwinni Provisional School opened on 16 October 1916 and became Miriwinni State School on 1 March 1918. On 9 July 2012, it was renamed Mirriwinni State School.

He holds several patents in the field of desktop publishingPeter Karow as speaker at the University of Macedonia Press and is known for his work on computer fonts. He contributed with several books and patents to the development of operating systems for computers. He is recognized as the inventor of outline computer fonts. \\\\- Peter Karow 2013 at the presentation of the 3rd. Dr.Peter Karow award to Dr. Donald E. Knuth\\\\- River Valley TV, Dr. Peter Karow, Type & Design 2009  Career  Born in Stargard, Pomerania, after graduating from high school in 1960 in Sch√∂ningen near Braunschweig, he enrolled at the University of Hamburg to study physics. He married in 1969 and has two children. After receiving his PhD in 1971, he co-founded the company URW Software & Type GmbH in Hamburg. In 1975, his Ikarus (typography software) was introduced to members of Association Typographique Internationale in Warsaw. Afterwards, Ikarus was used all over the world for the digitization of fonts. Between 1975 and 1995, URW digitized a large amount of fonts for companies such as IBM, Siemens, Microsoft, Apple Inc., Adobe, Linotype, Monotype, Rudolf Hell and numerous Japanese companies.  Contributions = Digitization of outlines for typefaces (1972) with Ikarus  Ikarus outlines Digitizer 1972 Printouts of single characters in a height of approximately 10 cm were digitized on a digitizer tablet of Aristo along their outlines, marking various points of support (beginning, corner, tangent and curve) with an accuracy of 1/100 mm. This invention together with a newly developed structure for storing and encoding single characters inside a font made characters, but also any other graphical signs freely scalable for the computer and available for other mathematical operations. ‚Äì Method and apparatus for automatic digitizing of contour lines, patent of DR.-ING. RUDOLF HELL GmbH  Calculation of the first typeface variations (1973)  Computer calculated variations 1973 After the output for plotters was programmed successfully - to make possible comparing digital output and original -, more software was developed to calculate first variations of fonts, for example italic, outlined and shaded typefaces.  Interpolation of typefaces (1973)  Interpolation of typefaces automatic correction of electronic slanting Software that enables to calculate interpolations and extrapolations between one light and one bold font version was than added and made it possible to create fonts such as ultra-light, semi-bold and extra bold variations. This invention drastically reduced time and effort for font manufacturers to create these intermediate fonts and was frequently used, particularly in Japan.  Text embroidery (1975)  In 1975, Peter Karow invented a software program for the company Gunold in Stockstadt, Germany, that made automatic stitching of embroidered text possible worldwide for the first time.  Calculation of bitmap fonts (rasterizing 1975)  calculation of bitmap fonts Distortions through random rasterization Controlled and optimal rasterization In order to display characters by means of electronic devices such as electronic typesetters, dot matrix or laser printers and particularly computer monitors, a fast calculation of bitmaps in any size (resolution) is crucial. In 1965, Dr. Rudolf Hell invented the Digiset, the first electronic typesetter. In 1970, Xerox put into operation the first small laser printer, and three years later the first PC was developed with a graphical user interface that used a bitmap memory for the creation of the video signal.  Character hinting (1975)  Peter Karow realized very quickly that - in the case of coarse resolutions -the mere calculation of bitmaps led to images of letters that appeared distorted through random rasterization. In order to prevent these effects, he invented additional information for letter characteristics such as vertical and horizontal linear or curved strokes or serifs and their classification with regard to upper and lower case letters. This facilitated the creation of improved bitmaps that could then be used as bitmap fonts for dot matrix and laser printers or electronic typesetters. In 1985, based on this concept, John Warnock and Bill Caxton from Adobe developed ‚ÄúHinting on the Fly‚Äù for PostScript fonts. This enabled the use of generally available fonts on any computer, printer and typesetter. In 1988, Peter Karow worked as an advisor for Apple Inc. during the development of hinting for TrueType fonts. In 1992, this method of font storage was adopted by Microsoft. Five years later both font storage technologies were combined as OpenType.  Character pair kerning (1981)  From 1981 to 1991, together with Margret Albrecht from Hamburg, Peter Karow devoted himself to the automation of kerning, i.e. the calculation of kerning values for the improvement of typesetting. These values had previously been determined empirically by font designers. ‚Äì Optical justification of text, patent of Adobe Systems Inc. thumbuprightLeft with / right without kerning [http://www.google.st/patents/CA2210266A1] ‚Äì Pointsize-variable character spacing, patent of Adobe Systems Inc.  Character grayscaling (1981)  thumbuprightLeft without / right with grayscaling [http://www.google.st/patents/US5579030] ‚Äì Method and apparatus for display of text on screens, patent of Adobe Systems Inc. Initially, the graphical user interfaces on monitors were black and white, and consequently the display of small type sizes was very poor due to jagged edges. Peter Karow tried to find an inexpensive solution to enhance the display by means of using grayscale instead of just black and white, but this solution did not immediately gain acceptance. As late as 1995, Adobe took his advice and then used grayscale in its Adobe Acrobat program for the display of texts on monitors. Today, all characters displayed on screens use grayscale for smoothing the edges.  Signus system (1983)  In 1983, the Ikarus Program evolved into the Signus System, a system that makes it possible to cut text, logos and other signs into self-adhesive foil for outdoor advertising. Today, this signage technology is referred to as \\"computer writing\\". thumbuprightWriting with the Signus system [http://www.google.st/patents/DE3375613D1] ‚Äì Method and device to check the sentence quality of printed matter, in particular for newspapers, patent of DR.-ING. RUDOLF HELL GmbH  Optical scaling of fonts (1991)  thumbuprightIndividual scaling per point size [http://www.google.st/patents/US5577170] ‚Äì Generation of typefaces on high resolution output devices, patent of Adobe Systems Inc. Hot metal typesetting in earlier times used the so-called optical scaling, when fonts were cut bolder and wider with decreasing point size. With analogue calculations Peter Karow made it possible to automatically adjust the fonts to certain point sizes. Nowadays, however, this technique is not often used.  Element separation of Kanji characters (1992)  The Japanese company Fujitsu hired Peter Karow and J√ºrgen Willrodt from Hamburg to develop a method that would automatically break down Kanji characters into single elements. This method made it possible to store the Kanji font using only 20% of the previously needed storage space without any loss of quality after reassembling the elements. ‚Äì Digitization of Kanji-Fonts, patent of URW Software & Type GmbH  Paragraph justification (1992)  Chapter justification with the Hz program In 1992, Peter Karow developed the Hz-program,Hermann Zapf: About micro-typography and the Hz-programm in RIDT‚Äô94, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, 1994, the automation of the paragraph justification, together with the well-known typographer Hermann Zapf and Margret Albrecht. The optimization of the paragraph justification was implemented using an algorithm developed by Donald Knuth ‚Äì Donald Knuth honored with Peter Karow Award along with automated kerning and optical scaling. In 1995, the underlying ideas and algorithms were passed along to the company Adobe, which incorporated them into their program InDesign.:de:Hz-Programm ‚Äì hz-program together with Hermann Zapf ‚Äì Generation of multitype fonts on high resolution output devices, patent of URW Software & Type GmbH  Chapter justification (1995)  Analogous to the development of the paragraph justification, Peter Karow and Margret Albrecht started working on an automated chapter justification. They succeeded in having each chapter of a book always start on a right page (recto) and end on a left page (verso) while avoiding widow lines and orphan lines. In 1996, a patent application was filed for this method at the company of Adobe, which has yet to be used in any typesetting program.  AdCyclopedia (1999)  On behalf of the company AdVision digital GmbH in Hamburg, Peter Karow developed the AdCyclopedia, a database for current and historic ads in newspapers, magazines, TV, internet, billboards, movies and emails. In 1999, the GWA headquarters (German Association of Communication Agencies) entered into a cooperation with the company AdVision digital GmbH in order to provide its members and their customers with an effective competitor monitoring tool on the internet. Today, the AdCyclopedia is extended to monitor spendings for advertising (budgets) per product, brand, company, country, and period.

There are two flatter valleys formed by Woopen Creek in the southern part of locality and Vorris Creek in the northern part of the locality. Although the land is predominantly freehold, only the flatter valleys are developed for use for agriculture while the more mountainous areas remain undeveloped. The principal agricultural use is growing sugarcane and bananas. Although the Bruce Highway does not pass through the locality, Mount Mirinjo () in the Francis Range is in the southernmost part of locality, close to the boundary with Ngatjan. It is above sea level compared with approximately above sea level at the nothernmost part of the locality.  History  By 1940, residents of Woopen Creek had agitated for some years to have a school in their district. In November 1941 tenders were called to erect the school. However, the school was not built at this time, probably because the fear of a Japanese invasion in 1942 resulted in the closure of schools in coastal areas and reserving all construction materials exclusively for military purposes. In March 1951 residents made another attempt to establish a school at Woopen Creek. In 1951 the Queensland Government decided relocate the school building from Nerada State School (which closed in 1945) to establish Woopen Creek State School. The school opened on 4 February 1952. It closed on 8 December 1967. In 2005 the Broken Nose Vanilla farm was established, an example of a wider trend of diversifying the agriculture of the Cairns region. In the , Woopen Creek had a population of 141 people.  Education  There are no schools in Woopen Creek.

After attending Cloudcroft High School, Herrell earned a legal secretary diploma from the ITT Technical Institute School of Business in Boise, Idaho.  Career  Since graduating from the ITT Technical Institute, Herrell has worked as a realtor in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  New Mexico House of Representatives  In 2010, Herrell challenged incumbent District 51 Republican Representative Gloria Vaughn in the June 1, 2010, Republican primary. Herrell won with 846 votes (54.2%) against Vaughn, and went on to win the November 2, 2010, general election with 3,077 votes (62.9%) against Democratic nominee Susan Medina. In 2012, Herrell was unopposed in both the June 5, 2012, Republican primary, which she won with 2,128 votes, and the November 6, 2012, general election, which she won with 7,750 votes.  2018 U.S. House election  In 2018, Herrell was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives, and was defeated in a close race by political newcomer and Democratic attorney Xochitl Torres Small. The results were close on election night, with Herrell in the lead at the end of the night and some New Mexico media organization projecting that Herrell would win. The next day, more ballots were counted which narrowed Herrell's lead, and media organizations rescinded their initial projections. The counting of absentee ballots ultimately established Small as the winner. Without offering evidence, Herrell alleged possible election fraud before ultimately conceding the race. A 2018 Associated Press review of Herrell's campaign finance disclosure records found that Herrell had failed to disclose that her real estate company earned $440,000 in contracts with two state agencies over a five year period. Herrell said that she had submitted all required paperwork and that the allegations against her represented \\"an attack on my moral character\\" orchestrated by one of her opponents in the Republican congressional primary. =General election results 2020 U.S. House election  Herrell is a candidate for the 2nd congressional district in the 2020 elections.

Macaire has held a number of senior posts in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and prior to his Iran posting he was the Director of Political Risk in BG Group plc.  Career  Rob Macaire joined the Ministry of Defence in 1987, and worked on a number of issues including procurement policy and supporting Special Forces, before transferring to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1990. His first diplomatic posting was in Bucharest, Romania from 1991 to 1995. He returned to the UK to work on the Middle East, following which he was posted to Washington, as First Secretary Middle East and Counter Terrorism, from 1998‚Äì2002. This included dealing with the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2002 Macaire returned to London to head the Counter Terrorism Policy Department in the Foreign Office in the immediate post 9/11 period. He served as Political Counsellor in New Delhi, India from 2004 to 2006, during which time he led a team responding to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in Phuket, Thailand. He returned to London as Director of Consular Services, responsible for all support to UK nationals abroad, including crisis response. In 2008 he was appointed British High Commissioner to Nairobi, Kenya, where he served until 2011. In Nairobi, he was involved among other things with Kenyans‚Äô efforts to fight corruption in their country, support for Kenya's new constitution in 2010, and was responsible for UK dealings with Somalia, including kidnap and hijack cases. Macaire has also worked as Director of Political Risk in BG Group plc. On 14 March 2018 the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced Rob Macaire as the new envoy to Tehran, replacing Nicholas Hopton. Arrest in Iran Macaire was arrested on 11 January 2020 during protests in Tehran about the shooting down of Flight 752 to Ukraine, but released shortly afterwards. In reaction, the FCO described his arrest as \\"a flagrant violation of international law\\", and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested that Iran was engaged in a \\"march to pariah status\\". Macaire maintained he did not attend a protest, but a vigil for victims of the plane crash and noted that \\"arresting diplomats is of course illegal\\". Iranian judges called on the government to expel Macaire by declaring him persona non grata as placards and cutouts of him were burnt in the capital Tehran. This is not thought to be a formal declaration and so does not have any legal standing.  Personal life  Macaire was educated at Cranleigh School and won an Exhibition to St Edmund Hall, Oxford (MA Modern History). In 1996, he married Alice (n√©e Mackenzie). While they were stationed in Kenya, Alice founded and chaired the initiative which resulted in the transformation of the Karura Forest. They have two daughters.

An unregistered employment agency told them they could earn money by working on Sinan County's salt farms. Instead, they were sold to a farmer who owned a salt evaporation pond for a million won. Kim was trafficked in 2012, and Chae was trafficked in 2008. They were forced to work unpaid on a salt evaporation pond in Sineuido, Sinan County. Kim and Chae were forced to work for 14 hours a day; if they did not work well, they were beaten with an iron bar or a wooden club. Kim attempted to escape the island three times, but all his attempts failed. After his third attempt, Kim was threatened with death should he try again. Soon after, Kim sent a letter to his mother. His mother called the police in Seoul. After that, Kim and Chae were rescued by Seoul police on 6 February 2014. The owner and the unregistered employment agency were arrested by Seoul police.Korean News While Kim was reunited with his mother, Chae was not able to live with his family, so he entered a facility for handicapped people. Most residents living in the islands and cities had helped the abusers to find the victims running away before this matter became an issue in South Korea. The residents included police officers who the victims were desperate to get assistance from.https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1004744063 After the rescue, Jeonnam Mokpo Police Station, Mokpo Branch of Gwangju Ministry of Labor of The Republic of Korea, and Sinan county investigated 140 salt farm workers at Sineuido (Ïã†ÏùòÎèÑ), Jeungdo (Ï¶ùÎèÑ), and Bigeumdo (ÎπÑÍ∏àÎèÑ). The investigators searched all salt farms in Sinan county. The investigation found 18 workers who had not been paid among 140 salt farm workers, two of whom were handicapped. One worker had not been paid for ten years although he should have been paid at least 120,000,000 won.ÏûÑÍ∏à Î™ª Î∞õÏùÄ 'ÏóºÏ†ÑÎÖ∏Ïòà' 18Î™Ö‚Ä¶ÏµúÏû• 10ÎÖÑÍ∞Ñ Ïö©ÎèàÎßå There are more victims, and most involved in trafficking were sentenced to be jailed for few years with a stay of execution in spite of the common sense that they were supposed to be jailed more than few years without suspended sentence.https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1004744063  Response = Domestic  Investigations by Korean authorities and independent journalists in 2013 and 2014 discovered around 163 salt farm employees, most of them mentally or physically disabled, who were being held and worked under slave-like conditions.

It is particularly strong in Germany where it goes under the name Freik√∂rperkultur. It refers to a lifestyle based on personal, family and/or social nudism. Naturism grew out of the German Lebensreform movement and the Wandervogel youth movement of 1896, and has been adopted in many neighbouring European countries and was taken by the German diaspora to North America and other continents. In 1974, the International Naturist Federation (INF) defined naturism as: ::Naturism is a lifestyle in harmony with nature, expressed through personal and social nudity, and characterised by self-respect of people with different opinions and of the environment. History Nude beach on the Unterbacher See, near D√ºsseldorf, Germany In late 19th century Germany, the idea of taking off clothes in order to liberate oneself was revolutionary. German naturism was part of the Lebensreform movement and the Wandervogel youth movement of 1896, from Steglitz, Berlin which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the Natural Healing Movement were using heliotherapy, treating diseases such as TB, rheumatism and scrofula with exposure to sunlight. At the start of the twentieth century the German naturism movement looked to Scandinavia as a model. The term Nacktkultur refers to a network of over 200 private clubs in Germany which promote nudism as a way of connecting the individual to nature. The term was coined in 1902 by Heinrich Pudor, who published a 3-volume treatise in 1906 connecting nudism, vegetarianism and social reform. However, its roots might go back as far as the 1870s. Its major promoters were Adolf Koch and Hans Suren. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932. The German naturism movement was careful to de-eroticise the naked body, which was not regarded as sexually provocative in itself. Instead it was believed that civilisation had taught us to look upon nudity as sexual. The naturist movement became well established in Germany from the 1920s onwards, more so than in any other country. It was portrayed as health giving and also gained prominence for its Utopian ideals. It became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to a breaking down of society and classlessness. It became associated with pacificism. In 1926, Adolf Koch established a school of nudism encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, as part of a programme of \\"sexual hygiene\\". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity. The naturism movement in Germany also saw nudity as serving the objectives of \\"racial hygiene\\" and eugenics. During the National Socialist Gleichschaltung era, naturism both benefited from official recognition and sponsorship for its health benefits, and was persecuted as officials argued over the concept of Nacktkultur. In March 1933, Prussian Minister of the Interior Hermann G√∂ring passed laws limiting mixed sex nudism, as a reaction to what he regarded as the increasing immorality of the Weimar state. In January 1934, Reichmeister for the Interior, Wilhelm Frick passed edicts restricting naturism due to fears that it was a breeding ground for Marxists and homosexuals. Reichmeister Frick's ban lasted one month. Within a year nudism was being practised with full state support again. However, prohibition did not mean the end of nudism and supporters including even SS leaders. The rules were eventually softened in July 1942. Nevertheless, all naturism clubs had to register with Kraft durch Freude, which meant excluding Jews and Communists. Also, they had to keep all activities well out in the countryside so there would be virtually no chance of being seen by others. Young East German women at a naturist beach in 1988. After the war, East Germans were free to practice nudism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive by the government). Nudists became a large element in German Left Wing Politics. The Proletarische Freik√∂rperkulturbewegung subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60 000 members. The popularity of naturism In East Germany was also partly due to the fact that religion played less of a role in that society. After German reunification, objections to naturism at the Baltic Sea beaches on the German-Polish border were raised among Poland‚Äôs predominantly Catholic population. In the West Germany, and today, united Germany there are many clubs, parks and beaches open to naturists. Since reunification, however, nudity has become less common in the former eastern zone. Vacationing in Mediterranean France at the large Cap d'Agde resort also became popular for Germans when it opened in the late 1960s, and Germans are typically the most commonly seen foreigners at nude beaches all around Europe. Facilities There are 147 naturist/FKK clubs in Germany, with a further 14 affiliated clubs in K√§rnten, Austria, along with a plethora of official beaches, and FKK zones in city parks. For instance, the Englischer Garten in Munich has two large areas on the banks of the Eisbach, between the city centre and the university.

During Tamar's reign, the family, with the title of eristavi (\\"duke\\"), held sway over the fief of Argueti in western Georgia, which purportedly passed on to them from the Kakhaberidze.

He was also a renowned barber, who counted many famous musicians amongst his friends, colleagues, and customers.  Life and career  Walton was born in Lombardy, Mississippi but grew up near Parchman Farm. He attended barber college in Memphis, Tennessee, and subsequently opened a barber shop in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Walton was known as the \\"blues barber\\" because his \\"Big Six barber shop\\" was a center of musical activity in Clarksdale. It was located first at 304 Fourth Street, and since 1989 at 317 Issaquena Avenue, which was previously the site of W.C. Handy's house. Walton was proficient on the harmonica, the guitar, and the razor strop, which he played by striking it rhythmically with his razor. Walton was recorded in his barber shop by Paul Oliver in 1960. He later recorded an album, Shake 'Em On Down, released by Bluesville Records in the early 1960s. In 1960, by chance, Robert Curtis Smith met Paul Oliver and Chris Strachwitz in Walton's barber shop. This led to Smith recording, The Blues of Robert Curtis Smith: Clarksdale Blues (1963). Walton played in the Kings of Rhythm with Ike Turner, but stayed in Clarksdale working as a barber when Turner took the group national. Many musicians and other notable people patronized Walton's barber shop to play music with him or in homage, including Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson II, and Allen Ginsberg. Walton was also a local NAACP leader during the civil rights movement in the early 1960s, resulting in the bombing of his barbershop. He makes appearances in Bill Ferris's 1975 documentary about the Delta blues, Give My Poor Heart Ease and in Robert Mugge's documentary film Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads. Walton died in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 10, 2000, at the age of 80.  Legacy  Walton was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail.

Bartley Kives, January 29, 2013  Writings = Novels  Mosionier's novel, In Search of April Raintree, was published in 1983. The story of April and Cheryl Raintree, two M√©tis sisters growing up in foster homes in Manitoba, Canada, and chronicling their lives from childhood into adulthood, was based on the traumatic experiences from Mosionier's own life, including sexual violence, the suicide of two of her sisters, and the search for her M√©tis identity. A revised edition of In Search of April Raintree, was published in 1984 entitled April Raintree. April Raintree (1984) is an expurgated version of the original, intended for young readers. Much of the original language in In Search of April Raintree (1983) i.e. profanity and graphic descriptions of sexual violence, including rape, was censored. Mosionier's second novel, published in 2000, is titled In a Shadow of Evil. It is set in the Canadian Rockies, and follows the life of a young girl going through family trauma and foster care. The novel was inspired by Mosionier's molestation by a priest at age three.  Children's stories  Mosionier's first children's book Spirit of the White Bison (1985) is told from the perspective of a young white bison. It portrays a distinct part of Canadian history, the fall of bison herds and the European settlers. Mosionier's story Christopher's Folly (1996) tells of a young man who is forced to understand his foolishness in a dream in order to earn respect for animals, and the world around him. It teaches children to respect their surroundings. Her next book, Unusual Friendships: A little black Cat and a Little White Rat (2002) the story of an unusual friendship between a black cat and a white rat, refers to different M√©tis relationships. It symbolizes the difficulties that M√©tis persons experience through not being purebred. The white rat attempts to teach others the jig and together the cat and the rat stick together to get respect for who they are. The story was created with a rhyme pattern.  Memoir  In 2009 Mosionier wrote Come Walk With Me: A Memoir, which depicts all of her life events and she shares emotional details of the experiences that she has faced.\\"\\"Come Walk With Me\\" shows author's determination\\". Kahnawake News.\\"Buy It or Skip It? Come Walk With Me\\". National Post. Becky Guthrie  April 6, 2010 The book has received a number of positive reviews.\\"The year in Manitoba books\\".

Design and development The Ka 3 and its predecessor the Ka 1 were mostly sold as kits for home assembly. Apart from their fuselages the two types are very close in appearance, simplicity, weight and performance. They share a round tipped high wing with constant chord and no sweep, mounted with 2.5¬∞ of dihedral and braced with a single lift strut on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing at about one third span. Plain, constant-chord ailerons reach almost from the tips to about mid span and upper wing spoilers are placed at mid chord, inboard of the ailerons. Both have 37¬∞ butterfly tails with straight leading edges and round tips and trailing edges. The Ka 1 has a ply-covered, rounded wooden-framed fuselage but that of the Ka 3 is more angular, steel tube-framed, fabric covered and slightly longer. Both have a simple, deep, sprung landing skid reaching from the nose to under the trailing edge of the wing, assisted by a tail bumper. Their cockpits are under the wing leading edge, into which the clear canopy extends. The Ka 1 first flew in 1951 and ten were built; the Ka 3 followed in 1954 with fifteen eventually completed.

Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people were left in the dark for days, possibly even up to 2 weeks without power. Delta Air Lines canceled over 2,000 flights, and it was reported by 8:00 p.m. Thursday, February 13, that as many as 6,500 flights originating in or destined for the United States had been canceled. On that day 70 percent of flights were cancelled at airports in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Charlotte. As of February 14, 22 people had died from the storm. Approximately 1.2 million homes and businesses lost power as the storm moved from the South through the Northeast. By the evening of Thursday, February 13, about 550,000 customers remained in the dark, mostly in South Carolina and Georgia. Meteorological history On February 11, a quick-moving area of low pressure moved across the Southeast, bringing rain and snow to areas like Atlanta, interacting with some of the cold air to the north of it. It then quickly moved offshore by roughly 3 p.m.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/11/2014&selmap;=2014021112&maptype;=radsfcus_exp This part of the storm was only the beginning of a crippling 2-day streak of winter nightmares across the South. Accumulations from this half of the winter storm ranged anywhere from of snow and a glaze of icing across the South. Later on February 11, another area of low pressure formed on the extreme southern edge of the Gulf Coast, near the TX‚ÄìLA border. Drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, it was able to fire up a small area of showers and thunderstorms near the coastline. As it tracked eastward, it began to interact with the cold air above it, producing an area of ice and snow on its backside as it moved to the east. On February 12, the swath of ice exploded in size as the conditions for freezing rain began to come together. Areas from eastern Alabama, including Atlanta in Georgia to the Southeast coast and South Carolina were included in this swath of icy precipitation. Meanwhile, to the south, near the Gulf Coast, heavy showers and thunderstorms were consisted in a streak of rain stretching up to southern parts of Georgia. As the low moved east, it then dissipated as a new area of low pressure developed off the South Carolina coast late on February 12, and that began to strengthen as it tracked to the north, placing the Northeast in the fire zone for the winter storm.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/13/2014&selmap;=2014021306&maptype;=satsfcnps Early on February 13, more snow began to develop on the northern side of the storm as the precipitation shield approached the New York metropolitan area in colder air. Heavy bands of snow set up as the system began its transition into a nor'easter, with some of these bands containing snowfall rates of up to per hour. At the same time, warmer air was beginning to funnel into the storm system, and as a result the rain/snow line slowly creeped up the state of New Jersey as the warm air began to further intrude into the winter storm. By 10 a.m, most of the precipitation had moved north of New York City, and began to reach into areas like Boston. Even though the area of low pressure, which had now deepened to http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/13/2014&selmap;=2014021321&maptype;=satsfcnps late on February 13, was offshore of the East Coast, little to no precipitation was falling as a result of dry air to funnel its way into the storm. Most of the snow totals in this areas ranged anywhere from , as a result. The system then continued to depart from the East Coast, before finally dissipating on February 24 near Europe.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20140224.gif Impact=Texas to Alabama Four people died in traffic accidents in Texas due to ice, and in Round Rock on February 11, a single accident resulting from ice on a bridge affected 20 vehicles. Mississippi had two deaths attributed to the weather. Several tractor-trailers jackknifed on Interstate 65 in northeast Alabama. Georgia Atlanta during the winter storm After being caught unprepared by another storm two weeks earlier, officials in metro Atlanta were much better prepared for this storm, having put down so much sand and gravel that by the weekend residents were asking for street sweeping to clean up the dust and potentially windshield-cracking stones it left behind. Most businesses and all schools were closed, and few people were on the roads. Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency, which he did not do two weeks earlier. The forecast was for freezing rain comparable to the January 2000 ice storms, which caused 500,000 to lose power and resulted in $35 million in damage, while areas of further-north Georgia received unusually heavy snows. Precipitation started as light rain late on the 10th, with significant snow by the following morning while still above freezing, turning back to light rain before ending by mid-day. More light rain began after midnight, changing to snow as temperatures fell, then to sleet, freezing rain, back to sleet again before another significant snow by the morning of the 13th. Areas north of the city generally got mostly snow and sleet, while a large swath from the south metro area eastward got the heaviest ice accumulations, though a dry slot at mid-day proved to be much more of a factor in limiting accumulations than had previously been forecast. The worst damages occurred in east Georgia, where over 80% of Augusta was left in the dark, and the Augusta National Golf Club was left littered with branches and other damaged landscaping just a few weeks before the Masters Tournament, in addition to a leaking water tower. The historic Eisenhower Tree, located on the 17th hole of the golf course, suffered irreversible damage and had to be removed. The storm damaged $65 million worth of timber. Further concerning residents was a magnitude 4.1 earthquake two days later, followed by a 3.2 aftershock two days later, at which time most power had been restored, after the storm. Several people were injured in sledding accidents. One being taken to a hospital near Holly Springs was in an ambulance that was hit by a skidding car, which then hit a Georgia National Guard vehicle that was escorting the ambulance. The GNG vehicle then took the young child the rest of the way to get medical attention for the original injuries (none were incurred by anyone during the accident). One woman died of hypothermia without heat in her home. The Oconee County Sheriff's Office jokingly canceled Valentine's Day, while many florists were late for deliveries to customers after their own incoming flower shipments were delayed. By late February 16, only a few hundred were still without power in east Georgia. Carolinas In parts of North Carolina, the forecast ice storm, which would follow snow, was expected to be the worst since December 2002. Around 6-12 inches of snow was dropped in some areas, along with accumulating ice. Governor Pat McCrory, declaring a state of emergency, warned people to be prepared. Early on February 12, 6,500 Duke Energy Progress customers in the Wilmington area had lost power. Winston-Salem had of snow, the most in 15 years, but areas to the north and west had over twice that. Three people died in North Carolina. Two of those died in car accidents, one in Chatham County and one in Moore County. The other died from a falling branch in Pender County. 100,000 lost power in the state. On February 13, President Barack Obama declared South Carolina a disaster area after a petition from Governor Nikki Haley, making the state eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency aid. Two and a half years, or 11 percent, of the state's timber was lost. The $360 million in damage was the worst for a storm since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. 15 percent of the damaged timber was salvaged, with 10 percent of value recovered. Mid Atlantic An MTA Supervisor boards a snow thrower on an elevated subway line in Brooklyn on February 13. Baltimore had of snow, and parts of Washington, D.C. recorded 15 inches, with nearby areas in Maryland reporting or more, resulting in the shutdown of the federal government and the capital's two airports. The event set a record in the Philadelphia region, where of snow fell, as it marked the fourth snowstorm resulting in of snow or greater in one winter. New York City recorded . On the morning of February 14, up to 100 vehicles were involved in multiple accidents on the eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Willow Grove and Bensalem from icy conditions. One accident involved about 75 vehicles, while another incident further east involved about 30 vehicles. There were a total of 30 injuries. Damage The fishing pier in Ocean City, Maryland, which had seen extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy, was damaged again in the storm. Strong waves and wind snapped seven pilings at the end of the pier. The heavy snow from the storm contributed to roof collapses in several states. The roof caved in at a BP gas station in Roanoke, Virginia, and at a Shell gas station in Richmond, Virginia. Following a partial collapse, 100 people had to be evacuated from the studios of NBC Lancaster, Pennsylvania affiliate WGAL, and the station was unable to transmit live for an undetermined length of time. The roof and walls of a ShopRite supermarket in New Milford, New Jersey, collapsed under the weight of several feet of snow. Also in New Jersey, an elementary school in Wallington, a department store in Woodland Park, and a sports complex in Waldwick, were among at least a dozen buildings across Bergen and Passaic counties that partially collapsed on February 14. No major injuries were reported in any of the incidents. Southeastern states were also struck with structural damages. The historic Craigie House in Atlanta collapsed except for its front fa√ßade, and the roof of a marina collapsed onto boats at Lake Lanier.

(March 12, 1906 ‚Äì March 27, 1998) was an American- born Catholic missionary and bishop. As a member of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (Maryknoll), he was assigned to missions in China, Peru, and Chile. He served as the Superior General of Maryknoll from 1956-1966. Early life and education John Comber was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts to Thomas F. and Nora (Higgins) Comber. He was educated at St. Mary‚Äôs Grade School in Lawrence and St. John‚Äôs Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts. He studied at Boston College for two years after which he entered Maryknoll Seminary in Ossining, New York. Comber earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He was ordained a priest on February 1, 1931. Priesthood After his ordination Comber spent eleven years in the Maryknoll Mission at Fushun, China. He learned to speak and write Mandarin fluently. After the outbreak of World War II Comber and his two sisters, Sr. Rita Clare, M.M., and Sr. Francis Helena, S.N.D. who were also missionaries in Japanese controlled territories, were interned by the Japanese military. They were among the second exchange of nationals repatriated to the United States in December 1943. After a period of recuperation, Comber was assigned to teach Mission Sociology at Maryknoll Seminary in January 1944 and five months later he became the school's rector. During his time as rector, 416 Maryknollers were ordained priests. In 1953 he was assigned to the mission field in Peru, where he learned Spanish. The following year he was appointed Group Superior for the new Maryknoll Mission in Chile. Comber was chosen as a delegate to the Fourth General Chapter of Maryknoll. On August 6, 1956 he was elected as the Fourth Superior General of the Society. During his ten years in office, Maryknoll experienced a period of rapid growth. They realized their largest number of members and mission commitments. While remaining as Superior General, Pope John XXIII appointed him as the Titular Bishop of Foratiana on January 23, 1959. Episcopacy John Comber was consecrated a bishop on April 9, 1959 in Queen of Apostles Chapel at Maryknoll Seminary by Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops Raymond Lane, M.M., Comber's predecessor as Superior General, and Martin McNamara of Joliet in Illinois. Comber attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. After the Council he was appointed as a member of the Post-Conciliar Commission on Missions. After his term as Superior General he served as an Auxiliary Bishop in the Archdiocese of New York. Cardinal Spellman appointed him the pastor of the Church of the Transfiguration in Lower Manhattan in 1967. He retired after two years and moved to the Maryknoll Development House on East 39th Street. Later that year he moved to St. Agnes Rectory in Midtown Manhattan. He served as auxiliary bishop until his resignation was accepted by Pope Paul VI on January 12, 1976. Later life and death As his health declined Comber moved to the St. Teresa Residence in Ossining where he remained until his death. He died on March 27, 1998 at the age of 92. His funeral Mass was celebrated in the Queen of Apostles Chapel on April 1, 1998 by New York Auxiliary Bishop Patrick Sheridan. He was buried in the Maryknoll Center Cemetery.

The association was officially registered in April 2011 and calls itself the \\"Russian-speaking group of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender people and their friends in Germany\\". The name plays on the words queer, art, and quarter. The association was first founded in 2009, when several activists organized the so-called \\"Rainbow Flashmob\\" on May 17 where, in honor of the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, thousands of colorful balloons were released into the sky.  Activities  Quarteera and the Russian speaking LGBT community in Germany are protesting at the CSD in Berlin against anti-gay laws in Russia, 2012 Quarteera's truck CSD in Berlin 2012  Educational activities  One of the goals of the association is to work with Russian LGBT migrants, helping them with their Coming Out to their parents and families who are often thought to be more homophobic than the rest of German society. Future plans of the association include creating of a professional consulting service, including professional psychological and legal support. From 18th to 28 December 2011, in co-operation with the St. Petersburg's association \\"Exit\\", the Russian LGBT network and the \\"Gender-L\\" association in Saxon Switzerland, Quarteera organized and led an educational workshop on the topic of homosexuality and tolerance at a winter camp for Russian youth. In December 2012 Quarteera, having received funding from the Hirschfeld Eddy Foundation, published a brochure in German about the situation of the human rights of LGBT people in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. In cooperation with the Quarteera Berlin Museum of Homosexuality prepared an exhibition in the summer of 2013, which was devoted to the situation of homosexuals in the Soviet Union and Russia.  Educational activities and organization of demonstrations  Quarteera has repeatedly organized various demonstrations and rallies in support of LGBT rights in Russia, together with German LGBT organizations. In June 2011, the organization participated in a rally in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin. The rally was also attended by activists of the Union of Gays and Lesbians in Germany, as well as the Bundestag deputy from the Green Party Volker Beck. In February 2012, Quarteera once again was one of the organizers of the protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin against a ban on the promotion of homosexuality in St. Petersburg. The protest was supported by activists from the Russian \\"Rainbow Association\\", the International Film Festival \\"Side by Side\\", the International Hirschfeld Eddy Foundation and the Union of Gays and Lesbians in Germany. The rally was also attended by German politicians, such as member of the Bundestag, Marieluise Beck. On June 23, 2012 at the Christopher Street Day Parade, Russian Quarteera opened the Berlin Pride, which attracted about 700,000 people. Based on the artists‚Äô Pierre et Gilles work, posters illustrating Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev were designed for the Pride. The posters were featured in the majority of Russian media materials about pride. Russian First Channel also interviewed the organizers of Quarteera at Berlin Pride. One of the members of the organization was invited to participate in a talk show. In November 2013 an activist of Quarteera, Ivan Kilber, broke through to the podium with his hands smeared with red paint and a rainbow flag, saying ‚ÄúMizulina has the blood of young homosexuals and transgender people who were killed or committed suicide on her hands\\" during Yelena Mizulina‚Äôs speech at the conference \\"For the future of the family\\" in Leipzig, organized by right-wing magazine Compact. In January 2014 Quarteera participated as a guest at a parliamentary meeting in the European Parliament at a meeting devoted to discussion of issues related to human rights in Russia. On February 1, 2014 the Red City Hall hosted an international conference in Berlin ‚ÄúGold For Equal Rights‚Äù, where one of the co-organizers was Quarteera. The conference was devoted to the situation of LGBT people in Russia. It was also attended by many Russian LGBT activists. Every year, the organization holds \\"Rainbow Flashmobs\\" in German cities ‚Äì launching helium balloons into the air on the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia. In July 2012 one of the founders of Quarteera, activist Ivan Kilber, was awarded the Hamburg Gay Pride prize for the invention of the \\"Rainbow Flashmob\\" in 2009, which was then held in more than 30 Russian cities, and has today turned into an international action.  Assistance in obtaining political asylum  Among other things, Quarteera wishes to help people obtain refugee status in Germany because of discrimination based on sexual orientation. In particular, Quarteera helps them to find a lawyer and prepare for an interview. In September 2013, with the support of Quarteera 26-year-old gay Pavel from Novosibirsk was granted political asylum in Germany. This was the first case of a homosexual obtaining Russian political asylum in Germany. According to Quarteera, after the adoption of the law banning promotion of homosexuality requests for assistance in seeking political asylum in Germany are received on a daily basis. As of November 2013 the organization has assisted only two people, 12 more cases were under consideration. However, Quarteera dissuades Russian LGBT from seeking asylum in Germany and ask them to consider other emigration options due to the fact that refugee status in Germany is very difficult to obtain.

Managed by the Argonne National Laboratory, AVTCs represent a unique coalition of government, industry and academic partners who join forces to execute North America's premier collegiate automotive engineering competitions. AVTCs provide a challenging, real-world training ground for North America's future engineers and automotive leaders and accelerate the development and demonstration of technologies of interest to the DOE and the automotive industry. Early years History of competitions = 1988-1990 Methanol Marathon  The Methanol Marathon (1988-1990) was an alternative fuels competition for college and university students in the U.S. and Canada. General Motors Corporation provided 1988 Chevrolet Corsicas which were converted to operate on an M85 fuel (85% methanol and 15% hydrocarbons).Competition organizers went on to further challenge the student teams by establishing more stringent and controlled tests of their 1988 Chevrolet Corsicas in 1989. An important addition to the Methanol Marathon was the inclusion of a gasoline-powered control vehicle that provided a baseline from which to judge the effectiveness of the conversions.  1990-1993 Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) Challenge  The Natural Gas Vehicle Challenge (1990-1993) was conducted annually which gave teams the opportunity to go back to the drawing board twice to improve the vehicle in areas believed to be lacking. In 1993, twenty-two colleges and universities from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, including five new entries, converted a GMC 2500 Sierra truck to run on dedicated natural gas. The teams underwent rigorous testing of emissions, fuel economy, performance, driveability, as well as judging by industry experts. In 1991, only three teams earned points in the emissions event whereas in 1993 eleven teams met or exceeded the current federal emissions standards. Seven teams did better than CARB TLEV emissions standards, and three teams met the CARB ULEV standards. The University of Texas - El Paso vehicle (a first year entry) tested less than 1/2 of the ULEV standard. The average EPA combined fuel economy (from both the city and hwy. tests) went from 12.7 mpg in 1991 to 13.6 mpg in 1992 to 14.82 mpg in 1993; a steady, and impressive progression.  1992-1995 Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Challenge  The Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Challenge (1992-1995), was an intercollegiate competition created by the U.S. DOE and SAE. The HEV Challenge began in 1993 with 18 Ford Escort Wagons and 12 Ground-Up vehicles; twelve Saturn SL2 sedans were added in 1994, and twelve Neons were added in the 1995 HEV Challenge. The HEV Challenge consisted of events in which vehicle designs and overall dynamic performance were evaluated. The events included acceleration, handling, range, emissions, fuel economy, consumer acceptability, engineering design review, and technical reports. All three HEV Challenges represented the most ambitious and difficult engineering research competitions to date. Although they showed that HEV technology is still developing, these competitions set performance benchmarks and established testing procedures that will affect the engineering community far after the last event was completed.  1995-1997 Propane Vehicle Challenge  The Propane Vehicle Challenge (1995-1997) began with conventional 1996 Chrysler minivan platforms, twelve college teams developed dedicated propane vehicles, while maintaining the performance that consumers expected from gasoline vehicles. The winning entries met the range goal of at least 250 miles with no problem, and the University of Texas-El Paso entry achieved an incredible estimated range of 716 miles upon refueling. 17 colleges and universities participated in the 1997 PVC with some teams using the 1996 Chrysler minivans or Dodge Dakota pickup trucks. For the first time, an award was given for the best component to the University of Texas at El Paso for the development of fuel-distribution spiders. This is a novel fuel-rail design that ensures equal distribution (temperature and pressure) of liquid-phase LPG to each fuel injector.  1995-1999 FutureCar Challenge  The FutureCar Challenge (1995-1999), adopted the goals of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), especially the 3X improvement in fuel economy. USCAR partners, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors, donated a mix of mid-sized sedans to the schools including Intrepids, Luminas, and Taurus‚Äô. Fuel used by the teams included reformulated gasoline, diesel and fischer-trophsch diesel, ethanol, compressed natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, hydrogen, dimethyl ether, and electricity. A wide range of events were held to test the vehicles‚Äô performance and the teams‚Äô ability to communicate their design choices and rationale. Performance improved over time with better batteries, control strategies, and experience.  1997-2000 Ethanol Vehicle Challenge  The Ethanol Vehicle Challenge (1997-2000) was developed to demonstrate the potential of ethanol to significantly lower emissions, improve performance, increase fuel efficiency, and improve cold starting of vehicles. During the two years of the competition the platform changed ‚Äì from a 5-passenger sedan (Chevrolet Malibu) to a full-size truck (Chevrolet Silverado) ‚Äì to reflect consumer demands for larger vehicles and more power. The venues changed ‚Äì from GM‚Äôs Milford Proving Ground in Michigan to a 7-day tour through Ontario, Canada. Events were added (off road, hill climb, trailer tow) or made more challenging (lower cold start temperature. By 2000, the winning vehicle in the emissions event (University of Illinois at Chicago) met the CARB ULEV standard ‚Äì one of the toughest in the world.  1999-2001 FutureTruck  FutureTruck (1999-2001) was designed to develop alternative propulsion systems and fuels that demonstrate increased energy efficiency and reduced emissions while continuing to meet customer expectations for performance and comfort. The U.S. Department of Energy teamed up with other sponsors to challenge more than 200 of the best and brightest students from 15 universities in the United States and Canada to re-engineer full-size SUVs to meet the needs of the future, producing green, efficient transportation that has the performance, utility, and affordability that customers expect. Working with General Motors during first two years of the competition, teams modified Chevrolet Suburbans by using cutting-edge technologies, such as fuel cells and other advanced propulsion systems, space-age materials, and alternative fuels including biodiesel and ethanol (E-85). Teams were also encouraged to develop technologies that reduce total cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. FutureTruck included an event that measures upstream fuel-cycle emissions (pollution resulting from producing and delivering a fuel) and dynamometer emissions measurements.  2002-2004 FutureTruck  FutureTruck (2002-2004) was designed to develop alternative propulsion systems and fuels that demonstrate increased energy efficiency and reduced emissions while continuing to meet customer expectations for performance and comfort. The U.S. Department of Energy teamed up with other sponsors to challenge more than 200 of the best and brightest students from 15 universities in the United States and Canada to re-engineer full-size SUVs to meet the needs of the future, producing green, efficient transportation that has the performance, utility, and affordability that customers expect. Working with Ford during the last three years of the competition, teams modified Ford Explorers by using cutting-edge technologies, such as fuel cells and other advanced propulsion systems, space-age materials, and alternative fuels including biodiesel and ethanol (E-85). Teams were also encouraged to develop technologies that reduce total cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. FutureTruck included an event that measures upstream fuel- cycle emissions (pollution resulting from producing and delivering a fuel) and dynamometer emissions measurements.  (2004-2008) Challenge X  Challenge X: Crossover to Sustainable Mobility (2004-2008) was a unique four-year engineering competition that provided the opportunity for students across North America to develop advanced propulsion technology solutions that increased energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of light-duty vehicles. To address the issues surrounding personal mobility (like vehicle fuel economy and emissions), General Motors Corporation (GM), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and other government and industry leaders joined to create the advanced vehicle technology competition. This four-year competition managed by Argonne National Laboratory challenged 17 university engineering teams to redesign a Chevrolet Equinox SUV to minimize energy consumption, emissions, and greenhouse gases while maintaining or exceeding the vehicle‚Äôs utility, safety, and performance.  2008- EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge  Established by the U.S. Department of Energy and General Motors, and managed by Argonne National Lab, EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge was a three- year (2008-2011) series that challenged 16 universities to redesign a Saturn Vue in order to reduce its environmental impact.  EcoCAR 2: Plugging In to the Future  Spanning three years from 2011-2014, EcoCAR 2: Plugging In to the Future challenged 15 universities to reduce the environmental impact of the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu. This competition was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and General Motors, and managed by Argonne National Lab.  EcoCAR 3  EcoCAR 3 is the current installment of AVTCs, spanning from 2014 to 2018, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and General Motors, and managed by Argonne National Lab.

He was known for his devotional songs and poems, and also his wit and satire. Biography Born at Itamati in present Nayagarh district of Odisha, he studied Sanskrit grammar from Bidyadhar Mohapatra of Mandhatapur. There is a story about his being the humorist poet in Odiya language. It is said that once given a mantra by a yogi (saint) he meditated upon Lord Hayagriba (one of the incarnations of lord Vishnu according to Hindu mythology)for His blessing. When the Lord appeared before him and asked him to express his wish, he to the God's utmost pleasure told how He cleans His nose as He is occupied with different aayudhas (weapons and other armaments) in all his hands, to which the God could not prevent Himself laughing, and blessed him to be a humorist poet from that day and he can write poems instantly without any imagination and thinking at any place, not only restricted to study rooms as poets usually do to write poems. It is also said that as he used the bamboo mat usually left by a dead person's family members at samshan (cremation ground) while chanting the Hayagriba mantra, for that reason (chanting of Hayagriba mantra sitting on bamboo seat is prohibited in tantra shastra, and thus results with negative effects‚Äîpoverty) he was poor throughout the life even though he was the dewan (administrative officer) of the king of Nayagarh. He composed invocations and prayers for Lord Jagannath, the deity of Jagannath Temple at Puri. His noted works include two longer poems in ornate riti-kal style, Raghab Bilasa and Prabandha Purnachandra. Jadumani was a great opponent of Brahmins (one of the four casts among Hindus) for their monopoly in Hindu rituals and misguiding the public in the name of dharma (religion). To teach Brahmins a lesson, he once invited a group of vedanti Brahmins on one of the anniversary of his late father and applauded them with lavish meals. After the bhojan (eating of meals), he told them that his late father had always a wish to see to have chadoos (a lining on the forehead with a hot rod of any kind by lightly touching) on the foreheads of Brahmins, and thus applied with a gold stick the chadoos on the Brahmins and the Brahmins could not deny that due to fear of raj danda (punishment by king's men)as he was the dewan of the then king. Since all the Brahmins on that occasion were very much ardent in vedant philosophy, it hurt them so much that on the same day at noon on the bank of Kusumi river, the 108 Brahmins chanted the bramha gayatri (principal gayatri mantra) with tears rolling from their eyes due to that great insult. All of a sudden a great lightning appeared on the cloud and burst upon Jadumani's only son Bhartuhari and he died on the moment. Jadumani later repented on that event of insulting Brahmins and went to Puri to see lord Jagannath and sang a song named Jagannath janana (a devotional poem on Jagannath). His satirist-humorous poems known as Jadumani Rahasya and anecdotes of his wit and practical jokes are also popular. Though he does not have a complete work to his credit as a humorist, some 100 short and witty compositions have remained in circulation and part of oral folklore, they were collected as Jadumani Rahasya, and later in Jadumani granthavali (Collected works) in 1965. He was a contemporary of kabi surya Baladev Rath. Once when he was in Puri at lord Jagannath temple while offering his prayer for his son's death, he met Baldev Rath who was also singing the sarpa janana (a song comparing Jagannath with a sanke)after his son's death. Both great poets of Odisha knew each other from the caliber of each one's song (the depth and meaning of the song which are very high). It is said that he once asked a question to Baldeva Rath who had first asked a question to Jadumani through letter before their meeting at Puri. Jadumani easily answered the question put by Kabisurya but the latter could not provide the former's. For readers fond of riti kabya (classic poetry‚Äîornamented with word mastery), below is that very question asked by Utkal Ghanta Jadumani Mohapatra. The answer to the above question is abira (or fagu in Odiya or color used in Holi). The meaning justifies as follows: abira's vibrant color defeats the color of the sun (Answer 1), 'abira' means who is not bira (or warrior) he can sell his weapon to earn a living (Answer 2), 'abira' = abi (goat in Odiya)+ ra (possessive)meaning that goat always fears to go near to water (Answer 3), and 'abira' = (a (vishnu)+bi (pakshi or [bird])+ ra (possessive)) which means Garuda the vahana of Lord Vishnu who never fears snakes (Answer 4). This single question raised as a poem shows the versatility of Jadumani's word mastery and the depth and breadth of his poetry. He died in 1868.

Its objective is to evaluate new Alzheimer's disease gene candidates for effects on Alzheimer‚Äôs pathology and related biological pathways. Phase I of the AGP focused on identifying all genes that contribute significant risk for Alzheimer's disease, thereby identifying more targets for the development of therapeutic interventions. Phase I was completed in 2008, with the identification of the novel Alzheimer‚Äôs genes ADAM10, ATXN1, and CD33. Phase II of the AGP entails the functional analysis of these genes. Phase III of the AGP focuses on the processing and sequencing of the complete genomes, then identifying all DNA variants in the genome that directly influence risk of Alzheimer's disease. From there, all of the biologically relevant genomes that may cause Alzheimer‚Äôs can be identified and targeted for the development of therapeutic treatments. The Alzheimer‚Äôs Genome Project was the largest single disease scan of all time and was considered one of the top ten medical breakthroughs in the world in 2008 by Time Magazine.

The half-hour-long show premiered in April 2014 on HBO. Last Week Tonight shares some similarities with Comedy Central's The Daily Show (where Oliver was previously featured as a correspondent and fill-in host), as it takes a satirical look at news, politics and current events, but on a weekly basis. Oliver has stated that he has \\"full creative freedom, including free rein to criticize corporations\\". His initial contract with HBO was for two years with an option for extension. In September 2020, HBO announced that the show had been renewed for three additional seasons of 30 episodes each, keeping the show on the air through 2023. The show's seventh season premiered on February 16, 2020. Production Oliver described his preparations for the show to an interviewer for The Wire: \\"... I basically have to watch everything. The only thing I kind of watch for pleasure is Fareed Zakaria's show on Sundays ... That and 60 Minutes I watch for pleasure, or maybe Frontline ... I have a TV on in my office all the time and I'll generally flick around on that from CNN, Fox, MSNBC, Bloomberg, CNBC, Al Jazeera ... I'm watching with a certain thing in mind and that is how to see a story told badly.\\" He said to another interviewer that he is concerned about dealing with old news: > If something happens on a Monday, realistically all the meat is going to be > picked off that bone by the time it gets to us ‚Äî there's probably barely a > point in doing it ... I think we'll be attracted to some extent by stories > that are off the grid ... Our show may end up skewing more international in > terms of stories. Tim Carvell, executive producer of Last Week Tonight, explained in an interview how the cast and crew deal with a half hour of Oliver speaking without any commercial breaks. Carvell also revealed that HBO gave them freedom in choosing guests for the show, advising them not to feel obligated to feature celebrities. When asked by an interviewer about \\"correspondents\\" such as those featured on The Daily Show, Oliver replied, \\"we're not going to be a parody news show, so no people pretending to be journalists.\\" During the fifth episode of season 7, Oliver stated that the studio and the show's offices were shut down after employees tested positive for COVID-19 and that the show would go on temporary hiatus. The show returned on March 29, filmed from Oliver's home, to cover the coronavirus and the response to it. Format The format is similar to The Daily Show, with Oliver sitting at a desk in front of a backdrop of a skyline containing buildings from around the world, often relating to the current topic. Unlike The Daily Show, Oliver tends to explore one concept in depth but retains the appearance of commercial breaks to intercut larger topics with smaller segments that are not necessarily related to the topic at hand. The show is taped in front of a studio audience, and HBO offers a limited number of free tickets to attend each week's Last Week Tonight taping. Filming takes place on Sunday at 7pm.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/watch-america-john-oliver-is- officially-a-us-citizen-now-1273984 As of March 15, 2020, the show is being filmed with no live audience at Oliver's home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show's theme starts off every episode containing images relating to it or the world at large with satirical captions written in dog Latin. Each episode covers a small handful of shorter segments, and then one main segment. While the short segments almost always relate to recent news, the episode's main segment usually covers in length and detail a political issue, even if that issue did not have news media attention during the preceding week. On occasion, the short segments are omitted and the main segment takes up the entirety of the episode. Oliver injects humor into his presentation, including satirical analogies, and allusions to popular culture and celebrities. The show includes a panel in the upper-left corner that frequently displays a photo or graphic for that accompanies subject at hand, which aids in the humor. A full-screen graphic will show and play a video clip (such as excerpts from news show or documentaries) when Oliver is citing it. He often coins hashtags related to his segment for use in social media, some of which go viral. A recurring element of the show is Oliver's use of mascots. The mascots used in the show include Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat, Hoots the NSA Owl, Taryn the Tinder Chicken, and the Last Week Tonight puppets. Oliver told Vulture in February 2019, \\"I mean, the truth of the mascots is that we have a gigantic room filled with spectacular mascot costumes now. [Executive producer] Tim Carvell and I ‚Äî I think we‚Äôve always seen the show as our attempt to make The Muppet Show and failing to do so. But occasionally, just occasionally, you get the kind of Muppet Show adoration in the ludicrous mascots.\\" The typical structure of the show is to open with a recap of a few of the week's news stories, segue into a video compilation, and then move on to Oliver's main segment. Some of the episodes will follow up the main segment with another video compilation or news story. Oliver's speech is broken up with video compilations of recent news clips, or recurring segments, into which Oliver segues with the slogan, \\"And now, this.\\" Oliver has also ended some segments with mock trailers for fictional TV shows or commercials that satirize the subject of his speech.  Celebrity guests The show frequently features one or more celebrity guests in its segments to help Oliver better get his point on the week's topic across. Guests have featured in many different capacities including giving monologues directly to camera, being interviewed by Oliver, playing musical numbers, participating in comedic skits with or without Oliver, or starring in fictitious parody PSAs. On the show, guests are sometimes seen in the Last Week Tonight studio itself doing their part during the show's main taping, while at other times they are seen in video clips that were pre-recorded at a different location and later included in the show. Oliver often interviews personalities who were directly involved in or impacted by the issues being discussed in the show to get their first-hand experiences and viewpoints on the issue. Some of the famous personalities Oliver has interviewed include Edward Snowden, the 14th Dalai Lama, Professor Anita Hill, Stephen Hawking, and Monica Lewinsky. Changes because of the COVID-19 pandemic On , Last Week Tonight began airing shows from what John Oliver describes as a \\"blank white void full of sad facts\\". The show is being produced largely via virtual communication, and the show is filmed without a live audience, away from his usual studio. EpisodesYouTube channel Last Week Tonight has a YouTube channel where videos are intermittently (depending on series) added after a show has aired. Most of the videos are of the main segment from each episode. Some extended clips are also available on the show's YouTube channel, as are \\"Web Exclusives\\" that are produced solely for the channel, such as a July 2016 video in which Oliver responded to negative comments left on the channel itself. The show's production has also created content specifically for fan use. For the March 19, 2017, episode, which reported on Bolivia's growing coalition of workers clad in zebra suits to educate civilians about traffic laws, the show's production recorded 23 minutes of a person in a zebra costume dancing and gesticulating before a green screen so that viewers could edit it into other videos for humorous effect. A similar video called \\"Real Animals, Fake Paws\\" for use in reenacting U.S. Supreme Court cases was released after the October 19, 2014, episode where dogs were used instead of justices to make listening to oral court cases more amusing to the general public and to increase interest in the subject. By April 2015, the channel had attained over a million subscribers. That number had risen to 3.6 million by July 2016, and over 5 million by May 2017. , the channel had over 8 million subscribers and more than 2.5 billion views.\\"Last Week Tonight\\" videos . YouTube. Retrieved April 3, 2017.  Social media  Last Week Tonight has a Facebook page with over 2.6 million likes, a Twitter account with over 3 million followers, and an Instagram account with more than 550,000 followers . Oliver often makes use of joke hashtags to facilitate the viral spread of his videos on Twitter and Facebook, as with the hashtag #NotMyChristian, which he used in 2014 to complain about the casting of actor Jamie Dornan in the feature film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey. The hashtag became a recurring punchline on the show, mentioned in both serious stories and casual segues. Reception John Oliver, host of Last Week Tonight Oliver's debut show garnered 1.11 million viewers. The number of viewers online, through websites such as YouTube showing extended clips of different segments, have steadily climbed into multiple millions. The show's YouTube channel also features Web Exclusives which are occasionally posted when the main show is taking a week off. Across the TV airings, DVR, on-demand and HBO Go, Last Week Tonight averaged 4.1 million weekly viewers in its first season. Last Week Tonight has received widespread critical acclaim. Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post named Oliver's program as 2014's best television show, writing \\"the year's most surprising contribution to television is a show that bucked conventional formats, left us buzzing and paved the way for a burgeoning dynasty. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver is 2014's crowning achievement.\\" Hank Stuever of The Washington Post compared Oliver's program with The Daily Show several times in his review of Oliver's debut: > Another scathing, stick-it-to-'em critique of American mass media and > politics shellacked in satire and delivered by a funny if almost off- > puttingly incredulous man with a British accent ... Exactly like The Daily > Show, the goal is to make elected and appointed officials, as well as just > about any corporate enterprise, look foolish and inept while slyly culling > together television news clips that make the media look equally inept at > covering such evident truths. James Poniewozik of Time similarly compared Last Week with The Daily Show, but also wrote that the \\"full half-hour gives Oliver the room to do more,\\" and praised Oliver's \\"sharper tone and his globalist, English-outsider perspective,\\" as well as his \\"genuine passion over his subjects.\\" Poniewozik wrote that Oliver's debut was \\"a funny, confident start.\\" The Entertainment Weekly review began by ringing the same changes: \\"The fear with Last Week Tonight is that it's The Daily Show except once a week ‚Äî a staggered timeline that would rob the basic news-punning format of its intrinsic topical punch ... The first episode of his HBO series didn't stray far from the [Jon] Stewart mothership, stylistically ...\\" However, the reviewer, Darren Franich, liked that Oliver has \\"a half-hour of television that is simultaneously tighter and more ambitious, that the extra production time leads to sharper gags but also the ability to present more context\\" and thought that the debut had \\"plenty of funny throwaway lines.\\" Franich appreciated Oliver's coverage of the 2014 Indian election, which the American press was largely ignoring, and, like Poniewozik, praised Oliver's \\"passion.\\" Franich concluded that Last Week Tonight \\"suggested the sharpest possible version of its inspiration\\" and that it \\"should feel like an experiment\\" but \\"felt almost fully formed.\\" David Haglund of Slate was ambivalent, writing that the show is \\"obviously a work in progress\\" and that one segment \\"felt like misplaced overkill,\\" but also that it is \\"good use of a weekly show, and it was funny to boot.\\" Gawker's Jordan Sargent claimed Last Week Tonight was \\"the new Daily Show,\\" while simultaneously criticizing the Daily Show for abandoning those \\"who have moved on from caring about Fox [News] and Republicans.\\" A number of commentators from mainstream media outlets, including The New York Times, The Huffington Post, Time, and Associated Press, have described Oliver's style of reporting as journalism or even investigative journalism. Oliver himself disagrees, stating that \\"it's not journalism, it's comedy‚Äîit's comedy first, and it's comedy second.\\" Awards and nominations=Reaction and influence A June 2014 segment about net neutrality in the United States was thought to spur over 45,000 comments on the Federal Communications Commission's electronic filing page about a net neutrality proposal that, if implemented, would have priority \\"lanes\\" for certain internet traffic. The FCC also received an extra 300,000 comments in an email inbox designated specifically for the proposal. It was thought that Oliver's segment had a major role in the FCC's ultimate reversal of stance on that proposal, with the FCC instead implementing net- neutrality rules that prohibited priority \\"lanes\\". A sequel in 2017 inspired over 150,000 comments on a subsequent proposal to scrap the new net neutrality rules. A segment on the then Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott received widespread attention in Australia across the mainstream media and was trending on social media. According to a document obtained by Vice, the military government of Thailand listed Oliver as \\"undermining the royal institution\\" for calling Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn a \\"buffoon\\" and an \\"idiot.\\" The show also made international headlines following Oliver's interview with Edward Snowden, which included a graphic, in-depth conversation about the amount of power the United States government has at its disposal in terms of intelligence, both domestic and foreign. Oliver also confronted Snowden about the lack of knowledge of the American people about his work and why they may be hesitant to analyze it for themselves rather than accept preconceived notions of him being a whistleblower. Notably, he tried to help Snowden in creating public awareness for the fundamentality of the surveillance problem in putting forward the question \\"Can they see my dick?\\" In a segment about public defenders and how some offices are extremely underfunded, the New Orleans Public Defense office's crowdfunding efforts to improve their conditions were featured. In the days following the episode's broadcast, thousands of dollars were donated to the office by the show's fans, helping them raise their goal four days after the show aired. For a segment in the October 18, 2015, broadcast, Oliver put on a comically grand demonstration with Canadian actor Mike Myers to urge Canadian voters to vote against Stephen Harper in the next day's Canadian federal election. As part of this gesture, Oliver displayed $5000 in cash in anticipation of being charged for the crime of being a foreigner attempting to induce Canadian citizens to change their vote as per section 331 of the Canada Elections Act. However, the agency responsible for overseeing federal elections in Canada, Elections Canada, explained the next day that prosecution of Oliver would not be necessary since inducement in the Act is defined as offering something material to voters. Per Elections Canada, Oliver did not try to influence the Canadian electorate, since the money shown was only for the anticipated fine, but merely expressed his opinion as a bystander, which is lawful. During the June 17, 2018 episode, Oliver spoke at length about Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, in part criticizing his censorship of Chinese media, his dictatorship and consolidation of power. Both \\"John Oliver\\" and \\"Last Week Tonight\\" were blocked from Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo immediately following the segment. The HBO website and content from the network were also blocked, although Last Week Tonight had already been excluded from HBO Asia. The promotion for Season 3 highlighted four derogatory quotes either the show or Oliver himself received: \\"Comedian fool\\" (former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, responding to a segment on the 2015 FIFA corruption case), \\"Makes people dumb\\" (an article The Wall Street Journal wrote about the show), \\"Very boring\\" (Donald Trump's assessment of the show), and \\"More unpleasant than a diuretic\\" (what President of Ecuador Rafael Correa said \\"gringo talk shows\\" were like, after being featured in a segment).  The John Oliver Effect  On several occasions, show segments on major societal issues, such as the \\"Chickens\\" or \\"Bail\\" segments, were soon followed by real-world change and action on said issues by the public, policymakers and/or other institutions. Several media outlets, noticing this pattern, suggested that attention from the show had instigated these changes, going so far as to dub the phenomenon the \\"John Oliver Effect\\". One of the most commonly cited examples of this is Oliver's first Net Neutrality segment which allegedly led to more than 45,000 comments being sent to the FCC, crashing the website set up to receive comments in the process. Oliver himself does not believe the effect to be real and has openly ridiculed the idea on the show, even calling the term \\"completely meaningless\\". Tobacco \\"Tobacco\\" is a segment about the tobacco industry, which aired on February 15, 2015, as part of the second episode of the second season. During the eighteen-minute segment, Oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices. He also introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International, the makers of Marlboro brand of cigarettes. The anthropomorphic diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to Togo and displaying billboards in Uruguay, and by encouraging use of the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter following the broadcast. The segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The mascot later made an appearance at a protest organized by the \\"Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids\\" in New York City in May 2015. Philip Morris International issued a response to the segment, stating that it included \\"many mischaracterizations\\" of the company.  Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies  In the Mandatory Minimums segment that aired on July 25, 2015, John Oliver talked about the controversial history of presidential pardoning, claiming that Abraham Lincoln once pardoned a man convicted of bestiality because he was intoxicated at the time; the man in question being John Wilkes Booth. He then confessed the statement was not true and for the first time mentioned a book compiling his favorite history lies. A couple of weeks later, he published a web-exclusive video based on that reference, expanding the content for a book called \\"Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies\\", to be released in the following spring. At the end of the mini- segment, however, he confesses again that the entire book was also a lie. In what seems a continuation of the lie saga, the book surprisingly appeared on Amazon UK in October 2018. The book description reads as follows: > There is absolutely nothing more fun than lying confidently about history. > Lying is incredibly fun. In fact, the only thing that feels better than > lying to someone is lying to someone, then regaining their trust, and then > lying to them again. This book, for example, was promised to be released in > April 2016. But that was a lie. The plan was always October 2018. Because, > you know, now is a time in history when lying openly gets you elected to > office. > In this book, you will find plenty of plausible but completely unverifiable > nonsense. Almost like watching Fox News but with a better sense of humour. > Hopefully, it will teach you much about nothing other than the true joy of > lying to people. Honestly, there has never been a better moment in history > to be a liar. We have reached a point where truths have become lies and lies > are now the truth. So learn from the greatest and get inspired by the best > lies in history. > *NB: Most profits from this book are going to finance railway infrastructure > under the English Channel. Contains strong language. Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption In August 2015, after delivering his \\"Televangelists\\" segment, Oliver hired a professional tax lawyer to set up a church called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption as a legal entity. He did this partly as a way to demonstrate how \\"disturbingly easy\\" it is, in terms of paperwork, to set up a tax-exempt religious organization as viewed by the Internal Revenue Service. As Oliver explained, the requirements needed to be defined as a \\"church\\" are quite broad. Since regulatory guidelines require an established location for a church, Oliver chose his studio location in New York City as its official location, although he registered the nonprofit organization in the state of Texas. Oliver's \\"megachurch\\" had a toll-free phone number which allowed callers to donate to the church, and said that any money collected would be redistributed to the charitable relief organization Doctors Without Borders. Oliver announced the formation of his church on the episode of the show that aired on August 16, 2015. Matt Wilstein, writing for Mediaite, saw Oliver's stunt as being along the same lines as comedian Stephen Colbert's setting up of a 501(c)(4) organization‚ÄîColbert Super PAC‚Äîas a way to \\"test the absurd limits of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision\\"; Oliver's megachurch, in contrast, is a way to test whether the IRS might view his \\"megachurch\\" as a tax-exempt organization. Steve Thorngate, writing in The Christian Century, suggested that the question of the religious exemption from taxation was more difficult and nuanced than Oliver portrayed, and not a simple matter of government regulation, describing Oliver's pivot to IRS policy as \\"unhelpful.\\" However, Thorngate agreed that Oliver's exposure and criticism of \\"manipulative sleazeballs\\" who \\"fleece the faithful\\" is \\"spot- on.\\" Leonardo Blair, writing for Christian Post, described Oliver's segment as a \\"brutal takedown\\" of televangelists and churches which preach \\"the prosperity gospel,\\" a message that dupes people into thinking that cash donations will solve medical or financial problems, while in fact the donations go to the personal aggrandizement of televangelists who buy expensive jets or large mansions. A week later, on the following episode, Oliver devoted a short segment to the donations the church had received, which included money from around the world. Oliver said he had received \\"thousands of envelopes with thousands of dollars\\" from donors. Displayed were several US Post Office containers full of mail. Oliver told viewers that the more money they sent in, the more \\"blessings\\" would be returned to them, adding that \\"that is still something I'm ‚Äî amazingly ‚Äî legally allowed to say.\\" Oliver announced that the Church would be shutting down during his show on September 13, 2015. All monetary donations have been forwarded to Doctors Without Borders.  Donald Trump  \\"Donald Trump\\" is a segment discussing American businessman Donald Trump. It aired on February 28, 2016, as part of the third episode of the third season. During the 22-minute segment, Oliver discusses Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and his long career in business. He also reveals that the Trump family name was changed at one point from the ancestral name 'Drumpf'. Although the changing of names was once a common practice among many non-English immigrants to the United States, the segment popularized the term \\"Donald Drumpf\\" and started a campaign urging viewers to \\"Make Donald Drumpf Again,\\" a play on Trump's own campaign slogan, \\"Make America Great Again.\\" It is the most popular segment the show has ever done. The segment garnered more than 85 million views on Facebook and YouTube combined which, an HBO spokesman has said, \\"is a record for any piece of HBO content.\\" Throughout the 2016 presidential election and following Trump's inauguration, Oliver made additional segments regarding Trump. Debt buyers \\"Debt Buyers\\" is a segment discussing the business and questionable practice of debt buyers. It aired on June 5, 2016, as part of the fourteenth episode of the third season. Oliver announced he had purchased nearly $15 million in medical debt that belonged to 9,000 debtors. He did this through a company he had created, called \\"Central Asset Recovery Professionals Inc.\\" (CARP), which he described as being \\"for the bottom-feeding fish.\\" Oliver stated that it was \\"pretty clear by now [that] debt buying is a grimy business, and badly needs more oversight\\" and went to point out that starting such a business was \\"disturbingly easy.\\" It cost him $50 to register the business in Mississippi, while it cost less than $60,000 to purchase almost $15 million in bad debt, medical debt from Texas. Oliver forgave the debt in its entirety, and claimed that it was the largest single giveaway in the American television history, eclipsing that of General Motors on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2004 where it gifted cars to Winfrey's studio audience, worth an estimated $8 million in total. Writing for Slate, Jordan Weissmann disputed the $15 million figure: \\"[Oliver] says CARP paid around $60,000 ... for its paper, which was 'out-of- statute'‚Äîmeaning the debts were so old that creditors technically couldn't even sue over them anymore. That suggests the seller thought the debts were worth no more than, well, $60,000.\\" The episode was highlighted in the academic journal Religions. The show partnered with RIP Medical Debt, Inc. to abolish the debt.  Coal mining and Bob Murray  On June 18, 2017, Last Week Tonights main segment was about coal mining and Bob Murray. In his segment, Oliver talked about how the safety condition inside the coal mines specifically the 2007 Crandall Canyon Mine collapse, which killed six miners, in which Oliver criticized Murray for claiming the collapse was caused by an earthquake, despite all evidence demonstrating otherwise. The show ended with a costumed squirrel named \\"Mr. Nutterbutter\\" presenting Murray with a voided check for \\"3 acorns and 18 cents\\" in response to Murray's company presenting its employees with low sums of money as bonuses, and how the employees retaliate by voiding the checks, and in reference to a claim that stated that Murray supposedly got the idea to start his company from a talking squirrel. On June 22, Bob Murray presented a lawsuit against Oliver, HBO, and Time Warner for defamation. HBO believed Last Week Tonight had done nothing wrong, with a First Amendment lawyer describing the lawsuit as \\"frivolous.\\" In February 2018, a West Virginia judge stated that he planned to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Murray as unfounded. After Murray's appeal to the West Virginia Supreme Court was delayed due to impeachment of its judges, Murray offered to drop the charges and HBO accepted. On November 10, 2019, Oliver discussed the case in a segment about SLAPP suits, revealing that the suit cost HBO $200,000 in legal costs and tripled the show's libel insurance fees. Oliver acknowledged that, despite the segment being vetted, the content would likely lead to another lawsuit, and that he would stand behind his team if it were to happen. The segment ended with a five-minute, Times Square-set musical number featuring crude and ludicrous fictional anecdotes about Murray. The musical number, entitled \\"Eat Shit, Bob\\", was later nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2020. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo On March 18, 2018, Oliver announced the publication of a children's book, A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, which parodies a book that Mike Pence's family wrote about their family rabbit, Marlon Bundo. Oliver used his book as a platform to criticize Pence's positions on LGBT issues, as it featured a rabbit in a same-sex relationship. The book became the number-one book and e-book on Amazon the next day, and the top-selling audiobook on Audible. Russell Crowe's jockstrap Russell Crowe's jockstrap became a notable piece of memorabilia when it was purchased by the Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and then donated to a Blockbuster Video shop. The jockstrap reappeared in a skit in the final episode of the 2018 season of the show. Robocalls The March 10, 2019, episode dealt primarily with robocalls, and how the problem had mushroomed in recent years since being increasingly deregulated under FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. To prove the point of how easy it was for any company to begin flooding anyone with robocalls, Oliver had one of his IT techs develop a system in which all of the FCC chairs would, at regular intervals on their personal phone numbers, receive a robocall followed immediately by bagpipe music. Oliver freely admitted his astonishment at just how easy this was to accomplish; the IT technician tasked with setting the system up told him they needed only 15 minutes to complete the project, doing so on a minimal budget. And per the very FCC regulations currently in place, Oliver quickly scrolled a section of fine print on screen at a random time during the segment, in which his office address was randomly embedded, and each FCC chair was required to send him an official letter to that address, notifying him in writing that they wished to have him cease all robocalls forthwith. Oliver was also flabbergasted at discovering that while tens of millions of dollars in fines were levied against companies for violating robocall regulations, only a few thousand dollars have ever been collected, effectively giving the companies free rein to continue robocalling unabated. Guinness World Records The main story of the August 11, 2019 episode was Turkmenistan and its autocratic leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. The last portion of the segment centered around Berdimuhamedow's obsession with Guinness World Records, with the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat being home to the most buildings with white marble cladding, the largest indoor Ferris wheel, and the largest statue of a horse's head, among others. Oliver found that Guinness World Records received sums of money ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 from companies and authoritarian nations to set records for publicity. He ended the show with a 600 square foot marble cake adorned with a picture of Berdimuhamedow falling from a horse; he had requested a Guinness adjudicator to certify it as the world's largest marble cake, a record previously set by Betty Crocker in Saudi Arabia in 2017. Guinness refused, stating that because their brand was \\"aligned with kids and families\\", they would not send an adjudicator; Oliver mockingly commented that he didn't \\"run a brutal enough dictatorship to meet Guinness World Records' high ethical standards\\". Oliver claimed that Guinness offered to certify it after the fact only if he signed an agreement not to criticize their practices on the show, which Oliver dismissed as \\"ridiculous\\". Guinness called Oliver's allegations \\"false and unfair\\", claiming that they did not send an adjudicator because they felt the cake was specifically for the purpose of mocking a record holder, stating it was their policy \\"not to partake in any activities which may belittle their achievements or subject them to ridicule\\". Narendra Modi John Oliver extensively satirized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a broadcast which went online on February 23, 2020 calling him a temporary symbol of hate. This was during a visit of US President Donald Trump to India, and in an organized rally which unexpectedly coincided with large-scale violence in Delhi, the country's capital. In this episode, Oliver likened Modi's BJP party's political beliefs to Adolf Hitler's, by noting that this party's founders, in 1925, had admired Hitler for his methods to ensure ‚Äúthe purity of the race‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúwhich is just not a chill thing to admire Hitler - and that, there is one and only one thing that it‚Äôs OK to admire Hitler for, and it‚Äôs the fact that he killed Hitler.\\" Oliver also lampooned Trump's choice of words to describe Modi as \\"the father of India\\", suggesting that there is a certain Gandhi that already holds that exact title. The brunt of his attacks, however, were aimed at Modi's \\"increasingly controversial reputation and widespread protests against his government's citizenship measures.\\" In his attempt to explain the political climate in India under BJP which condones widespread violence against Muslims, Oliver mentions how Modi's party-appointed head of Uttar Pradesh, the largest BJP-ruled state of India, said at a recent rally: ‚ÄúIf they kill one Hindu then we will also kill 100 of them (Muslims).\\" He further adds that Modi's party has also edited religious pluralism out of history textbooks, and introduced primary school textbooks teaching Indian supremacy, and that the image is \\"nauseating\\" and that for perhaps the first time in Modi's whole career, his actions are creating a massive and sustained backlash. Oliver concludes this segment by saying that when Trump says Modi is bringing India together, ‚Äúwith any luck, the thing that unites them may actually end up being their complete disgust over what he is trying to do‚Äù, since India, home of the ‚Äúsymbol of love‚Äù Taj Mahal, ‚Äúfrankly deserves much more than this temporary symbol of hate‚Äù. Disney+ Hotstar, an Indian streaming service who holds rights to HBO programming in the country, refused to stream the episode, leading to criticism by local viewers (including Hotstar's apps being review bombed with 1-star reviews). Oliver addressed the censorship in the March 8, 2020 episode, also noting that since the acquisition of Hotstar by The Walt Disney Company (which occurred as part of its acquisition of 21st Century Fox), Hotstar had begun to censor jokes regarding Disney characters from the program, such as his \\"factually- accurate\\" claim that Donald Duck had a corkscrew penis. Danbury, Connecticut John Oliver satirized the town of Danbury, Connecticut on a broadcast that aired on by making fun of the general quaintness of the town, starting a feud with the town that would last a few weeks, involving the Mayor of Danbury, a YouTube show called \\"Danbury Hat Tricks\\", and other various content creators in Danbury. The mayor of Danbury, in response, revealed that they would rename their sewer plant, which makes up more than 80% of their $127 million budget, the \\"John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant\\", because, as he stated, \\"It's full of crap, just like you [John Oliver]\\". The mayor reneged on this statement later in the week, claiming it was a joke, but after John Oliver offered $55,000 to local charities on a broadcast that aired on in exchange for the sewage plant actually being named after him, Danbury accepted the offer.

He was an early friend of Polish-French composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. In his youth Woyciechowski was a fellow student of Chopin at the Warsaw Lyceum, and boarded with the Chopin family. He went on to study law at Warsaw University. Chopin dedicated to him his Op. 2 Variations on \\"L√† ci darem la mano\\". In 1830 Chopin visited Woyciechowski at his estate in Poturzyn, which he had inherited from his mother.Woyciechowski (a) Woyciechowski acted as a confidant during Chopin's passion for the singer Konstancja G≈Çadkowska.Zamoyski (2010), pp. 55-6.

An urban legend, myth, or tale is a modern genre of folklore. It often consists of fictional stories associated with the macabre, superstitions, cryptids, creepypasta, and other fear generating narrative elements. Urban legends are often rooted in local history and popular culture. 0‚Äì9 * 999 phone charging myth is an urban legend which claims that calling the police and fire services, then hanging up, charges mobile phone batteries. A‚ÄìF * Aerial water bomber picking up scuba diver: about a water bomber, or a helicopter with a dangling water bucket, scooping up a scuba diver and dumping him or her on a wildfire site. Urban legend debunking site Snopes.com reports there are no proven cases of this happening in reality. The Discovery Channel show Mythbusters also disproved the myth. * The Ankle slicing car thief or The man under the car is an urban legend that tells of a driver that keeps hearing noises under their car when they are driving. When they step out of the car to investigate, their ankles get sliced open with a knife. And when they are rolling around on the ground in pain, a car thief emerges from underneath the car and steals it. * Baby Train is an urban legend which claims that a small town had an unusually high birth rate because a train would pass through the town at 5:00 am and blow its whistle, waking up all the residents. Since it was too late to go back to sleep and too early to get up, couples would have sex. This resulted in the mini-baby boom. * Black-eyed children (or black-eyed kids) are an urban legend of supposed paranormal creatures that resemble children between the ages of 6 and 16, with pale skin and black eyes, who are reportedly seen hitchhiking or panhandling, or are encountered on doorsteps of residential homes. Tales of black-eyed children have appeared in pop culture since the late 1990s. * Black Volga refers to a black Volga limousine that was allegedly used to abduct people, especially children. * The Blue star tattoo legend refers to a modern legend that LSD tabs are being distributed as lick-and-stick temporary tattoos to children. * Bloody Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called multiple times. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly \\"witnessed\\" in group participation games. * Bunny Man is an urban legend that probably originated from two incidents in Fairfax County, Virginia, in 1970, but has been spread throughout the Washington D.C. area. There are many variations to the legend, but most involve a man wearing a rabbit costume (\\"bunny suit\\") who attacks people with an axe. * Castilian lisp ‚Äì An urban legend claiming that the prevalence of the sound in Spanish can be traced back to a Spanish king who spoke with a lisp, and whose pronunciation spread by prestige borrowing to the rest of the population. This myth has been discredited by scholars for lack of evidence. * The chupacabra (, from chupar \\"to suck\\" and cabra \\"goat\\", literally \\"goat sucker\\") is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas, with the first sightings reported in Puerto Rico. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats. * Cow tipping purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. * Creepypastas are horror- related legends or images that have been copy-pasted around the Internet. These Internet entries are often brief, user-generated, paranormal stories intended to scare readers. They include gruesome tales of murder, suicide, and otherworldly occurrences. People often (falsely) believe them to be true. * The Curse of the Bambino was a superstition evolving from the failure of the Boston Red Sox baseball team to win the World Series in the 86-year period from 1918 to 2004. While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner. G‚ÄìL * Hanako-san is a Japanese urban legend of the spirit of a young girl who haunts school bathrooms, and can be described as a y≈çkai or a y≈´rei. To summon her, individuals must enter a girls' bathroom (usually on the third floor of a school), knock three times on the third stall, and ask if Hanako-san is present. * Hippo Eats Dwarf. An internet-spread urban legend about a circus performer being accidentally swallowed by a hippopotamus. * The Hook, also called Hookman, is a classic example of an urban legend. Originating in post-war America, it recounts a story of a murderer with a hook prosthesis in place of a hand. * JATO Rocket Car started as a Darwin Award winner where a driver strapped a pair of Jet Assisted Take Off (JATO) units to the rear of his car and ended up smashing into the side of a hill in Arizona. No police agency in Arizona took a report of this type of accident. The Arizona Department of Public Safety even issued a press release on their website debunking the report. This myth was also tested on the Discovery Channel show Mythbusters multiple times. * Killer in the backseat (also known as High Beams) is a common car-crime urban legend well known mostly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a strange car or truck. The mysterious pursuer flashes his high beams, tailgates her, and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a murderer, rapist, or escaped mental patient) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, after which he ducked down. *Killswitch is a fictional video game. According to the legend, this game can only be played once - If your character dies or you manage to complete the game, the game will delete itself and will leave no trace. It has also been cited as the primary inspiration behind the creepypasta Ben Drowned. *Kuchisake-onna (Âè£Ë£Ç„ÅëÂ•≥, \\"Slit-Mouthed Woman\\") is a Japanese urban legend about the malevolent spirit, or onry≈ç, of a mutilated woman. She is said to partially cover her face with a mask or object and reportedly carries a sharp tool of some kind, such as a knife or a large pair of scissors. *The Licked Hand, also known as Doggy Lick or Humans Can Lick Too, is an urban legend popular among teenagers. The story describes a killer who secretly spends the night under a girl's bed, licking her hand when offered, which she takes to be her dog. M‚ÄìS * Madam Koi Koi is an urban legend in Nigeria about a dead teacher who haunt's boarding schools * Melody is dead is an urban legend claiming that Spanish singer Melody died in a plane accident. * Men in black is an urban legend and conspiracy theory claiming that men dressed in black suits who claim to be government agents who harass or threaten UFO witnesses or victims of alleged Alien Abductions to keep them quiet about what they have seen.Clark, Jerome (1996). The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 3: High Strangeness, UFO's from 1960 through 1979. Omnigraphics. 317‚Äì18. * Nale Ba is a popular folk legend which features prominently in areas across Karnataka, India. \\"Naale Baa\\" (‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤≥‡≥Ü ‡≤¨‡≤æ in Kannada) has been found written on walls of small towns and villages for years now.

In a racing which lasted from July 2003 until October 2006 he competed in five countries and won six of his fifteen races. He was unbeaten in two races as a two-year-old including the Killavullan Stakes and won the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on his first appearance of 2004. After being placed in both the 2000 Guineas and the Irish 2,000 Guineas he recorded his most important success when defeating The Derby winner North Light in the Irish Derby. As a four-year-old he defeated a strong field to win the Tattersalls Gold Cup, but did not win again in Europe. He was campaigned internationally in 2006, winning the Jim Murray Memorial Handicap in California. At the end of his racing career he was retired to become a breeding stallion in Australia. Background Grey Swallow is a grey horse bred in Ireland by Marguerite Weld, the mother of the trainer Dermot Weld. He is probably the best horse sired by the multiple Group One winner Daylami, from whom he inherited his colour. His dam, Style of Life won two minor races as a three-year-old in 1988, and was a sister of the Ballycorus Stakes winner Seasonal Pickup. She produced at least six other winners. In September 2002, the yearling was consigned by the Pipers Hill Stud to the Tattersalls Houghton Sale at Newmarket and was bought for 150,000 guineas by the bloodstock agents McKeever St Lawrence. He entered the ownership of Rochelle Quinn and was sent into training with Dermot Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare. Racing career=2003: two-year-old season Grey Swallow made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Galway Racecourse on 28 July 2003. He took the lead entering the straight and drew away from the opposition to win by ten lengths in \\"impressive\\" style. The colt was off the course for three months before starting 4/9 favourite for the Group Three Killavullan Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. He took the lead one and a half furlongs from the finish and accelerated clear of his three rivals, winning by eight lengths. 2004: three-year-old season Grey Swallow's second season began on 18 April when he started the 4/9 favourite for the 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown. He took the lead inside the final furlong, but was unable to pull away from his rivals, winning by a head from Meath, an Aidan O'Brien-trained colt to whom he was conceding five pounds. On his next appearance, the colt was sent overseas for the first time when he was one of fourteen runners for the British Classic 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. He started slowly and was never able to reach the leaders and finished fourth behind Haafhd, Snow Ridge and the John Oxx-trained Azamour. Three weeks after his run in England, Grey Swallow started second favourite behind Azamour for the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh Racecourse but the two Irish colts were beaten into third and second places respectively by the British-trained outsider Bachelor Duke. On 27 June, Grey Swallow was moved up in distance for the Budweiser Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh. The race attracted North Light, Rule of Law, Let the Lion Roar and Percussionist, the colts who had finished first, second, third and fourth in The Derby earlier in the month and Grey Swallow started the 10/1 fourth choice in a field of ten runners. The grey colt raced behind the leaders before moving up to third place behind North Light and Rule of Law with a quarter mile left to run. He overtook North Light just inside the final furlong and stayed on to defeat the English Derby winner by half a length, with the 150/1 outsider Tycoon taking third place. After the race Smullen said \\"I knew he had the speed to beat them if he stayed the trip and that's how I rode him. When we started to make our challenge I knew that we would be able to outspeed them. I'm more happy for him than I am for me\\". Dermot Weld said: \\"This was a very good Derby and an extra special win as he was bred by my mother, who also owns part of him\\". After a break of two and a half months, Grey Swallow returned for the Irish Champion Stakes over one a and a quarter miles at Leopardstown on 11 September in which he was matched for the first time against older horses. He started the 9/2 second favourite in a field which included Doyen, Rakti, Azamour and Powerscourt. He reached third place in the straight, but made no impression in the closing stages, finishing fourth of the eight runners behind Azamour. For his final appearance of the season, Grey Swallow was sent to France to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse, with his owners paying a supplementary fee of ‚Ç¨60,000 as the colt had not been among the original entries. He started second favourite behind North Light, but weakened quickly in the straight and finished eighteenth of the nineteen runners behind Bago. 2005: four-year-old season In 2005, Grey Swallow raced in the colours of Murry Rose Bloodstock. He made his debut in the Group 1 Tattersalls Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at the Curragh on 22 May and started third choice in the betting behind Bago and Azamour. Smullen, riding on his 28th birthday, settled the grey in fourth place before moving steadily forward in the straight to take the lead one and a half furlongs from the finish. In the closing stages he held off the late challenge of Bago to win by three quarters of a length, with Ace beating Azamour for third place. Dermot weld described the winner as \\"brave and tough as well as being talented. He did get a bit tired towards the finish but that was understandable\\". After a break of two months, Grey Swallow contested Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, which was run that year at Newbury Racecourse. Starting the 100/30 second favourite, but after making a forward move with a half a mile to run, he faded in the closing stages and finished seventh of the twelve runners behind Azamour. The horse's next race was the Irish Champion Stakes in September, in which he faced a field which included Azamour, Motivator, Oratorio and Alexander Goldrun. He reached third place in the straight but was unable to maintain his challenged and finished sixth behind Oratorio, beaten almost seven lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the year he was sent to Canada for the Pattison Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racecourse. He finished third behind Relaxed Gesture, but was demoted after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards found that Smullen had struck the fourth-placed finisher Electrocutionist with his whip in the straight. 2006: five-year-old season In the early summer of 2006, Grey Swallow was sent to North America for two races in which he was owned by Vega FZE and ridden by Alex Solis. On 13 May, carrying top weight of 121 pounds, he started 3/5 favourite for the Grade II Jim Murray Memorial Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Solis sent the horse into the lead early in the straight and he drew away to win by five lengths from Brecon Beacon. Daily Racing Form reported that his performance had \\"raised the bar for turf horses in America\\". Four weeks later, Grey Swallow started third favourite in a seven-runner field for the Grade I Manhattan Handicap at Belmont Park. He was restrained by Solis in the early stages and was still three and a lengths off the pace entering the last quarter mile. He produced a strong late run on the outside, but finished third, beaten a head and a neck by Cacique and Relaxed Gesture. Grey Swallow was then bought by Peter Rowsthorn for a sum of between A$4m and A$6m and was sent to compete in Australia where he was trained by Dale Sutton. He made no impact on his only start for his new connections, finishing last of the twelve runners behind Fields of Omagh in the Cox Plate on 28 October. Assessment and honours In the 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Grey Swallow was given a rating of 123, seven pounds the leader Ghostzapper, making him the ninth best racehorse in the world. In the following year, he was rated 122, making him the twentieth-best racehorse in the world, eight pounds behind the top-rated Hurricane Run. In 2006, his rating dropped to 119 and he was rated forty-fourth in the world. Stud record Grey Swallow was retired from racing to stand as a breeding stallion in Australia, based at the Woodside Park Stud in Victoria.

The term has historically been used to indicate the rebuttal of false teachings, and thereby break negative patterns in one's thoughts, words and deeds. In modern times, the term often refers to the proselytization and conversion of new adherents in Nichiren Buddhism (see second President of Soka Gakkai Josei Toda), and the rebuttal of teachings regarded as heretical or preliminary. Although often associated with the teachings of the Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren, the term appears often in the SAT Daizokyo and the works of the Chinese Tiantai patriarchs Zhiyi and Zhanran. Nichiren Buddhist organizations such as Kokuch≈´kai, Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ and Soka Gakkai continue to use the term today, which is meant to underline or convince a counterpart of one's own interpretation of Buddhism. Another method of propagation mentioned by Nichiren is , which underlines the individual's own insight on Buddhism. Nichiren himself referred to both methods in his . A combination of the two is known as .Britannica Kokusai Dai-Hyakkajiten article on \\"sh≈çju-shakubuku\\".In Japan, the term shakubuku is used when proselytising adherents of other Buddhist traditions, while sh≈çju is used when proselytising non-Buddhists.

All 56 people on board were killed. At the time, it was the second-deadliest aviation accident on US soil, behind Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501. Aircraft and occupants The aircraft involved in the accident, registered N1678M, was a Curtiss C-46F-1-CU Commando military aircraft that had been converted into a commercial airliner. It had first flown in 1945 and had logged a total of 4,138 flight hours during its career. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-51 Double Wasp engines. The aircraft's occupants on the accident flight consisted of 52 passengers and six crew, including the captain, C. A. Lyons of Miami, and Doris Ruby, a popular nightclub entertainer from Sunnyside, Queens.List of Dead in Crash of Plane in New Jersey, The New York Times, December 17, 1951, pg. 2. Accident The Miami Airlines C-46 was preparing for a non-scheduled non-stop passenger flight from Newark to Tampa. Of the aircraft's two engines, the right engine took longer to start up; ominously, people nearby could see smoke continuously coming from that engine. At around 3:00 PM EST, the flight taxied out to runway 28, and was cleared for takeoff at 3:03. Just after takeoff, however, Newark ATC personnel saw a trail of white smoke coming from the right side of the aircraft. The tower controller, concerned about the danger of there being a fire, pressed the airport crash alarm button. A Miami Airlines captain observing the takeoff from the ground also saw the smoke, which he believed was due to an overheated right brake. He telephoned the control tower and warned for the aircraft to keep its landing gear down or, if it had already been raised, to extend it. The tower relayed his warning to the flight crew of the C-46, who acknowledged and started the process of lowering the landing gear. The aircraft continued ahead in the direction it took off in for a distance of about four miles, slowly gaining an altitude of approximately 800 to 1,000 feet. All throughout, the smoke progressively worsened; by the time the aircraft had reached the four-mile point, black smoke and actual flames could be seen trailing from the underside of the right engine nacelle. Shortly after the landing gear was lowered, a large burst of flames erupted from underneath the right nacelle. The aircraft banked left to an angle of about 10 degrees and continued onwards in this position for another 4.5 miles, gradually losing altitude as it went. While flying over the nearby city of Elizabeth, the aircraft, at an estimated altitude of just 200 feet, suddenly lurched into a 90-degree left bank from which no recovery was possible. Although Captain Lyons managed to keep the aircraft from hitting the streets, apartment buildings, and a railroad depot below, the aircraft's left wingtip eventually struck the gabled roof of a vacant house near its ridge. The now- out of control aircraft then crashed nose-first into a one-story brick storage building owned by Elizabeth Water Co. before finally coming to rest on the banks of the Elizabeth River. The aircraft's load of fuel ignited immediately upon impact, engulfing both remains of the aircraft and the wrecked storage building in a raging inferno. Nearby firefighters quickly arrived on the scene and eventually extinguished the fire after about 17 minutes. The aircraft's wreckage came to rest in a generally inverted position and partially submerged in shallow water. All 52 passengers and six crew aboard the aircraft died, while another person on the ground was seriously injured. Aftermath According to the accident report, the hold-down studs of the right engine's number 10 cylinder failed, setting off the fire that ultimately brought down the Miami Airlines C-46. The accident was the first of three in Elizabeth, N.J. during the winter of 1951‚Äì52. Just over a month later, an American Airlines Convair 240 crashed while on final approach into Newark, killing all 23 people on board and seven on the ground. Less than a month later, a National Airlines DC-6 crashed into an apartment building, killing 29 of the 59 people on board and 4 people on the ground. Newark Airport was closed following the latter accident, and remained so until November 15, 1952. The three crashes later provided the inspiration to writer and Elizabeth resident Judy Blume for her 2015 novel In the Unlikely Event.

The book examines the scientific reasons people are attracted to one another including the evolutionary underpinnings of sexual attraction, monogamy, and sexual orientation. Overview How Sex Works uses evolutionary biology to explore human sexuality, and how sexuality can influence society in terms of human relations and belief systems. The author examines the physiological purpose behind how sensory data is interpreted by the human body and its effect on human sexuality. Moalem arguest that menstruation, fertility, penis size, orgasm, ejaculation and contraception all have traces back to the ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù and human's desire to find a healthy partner for reproduction. The book covers other evolutionary factors influencing sexual attraction include pheremones, genetic makeup, immune system compatibility and ovulation. The book uses various examples to illustrate the author's central point, including: * Body scents are linked to strength of immune systems, signaling potential mates on the viability of producing healthy offspring * Brazilian waxes have become more desirable as our subconscious attempts to eradicate pubic lice * Men watching pornography with other men in the shot (along with a female) can lead to increased sperm production due to the perceived competition * Women are more likely to fantasize about men who aren't their partners during ovulation, more likely to lead to fraternal twins * Men are attracted to women with low waist-to-hip ratio (hourglass shape) because fatty acids stored in hip fat aid brain development in fetuses and lead to smarter children Criticism Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"provocative and entertaining\\" describing it as \\"a volume stuffed with information that avoids getting bogged down in difficult medical terms or complex biological concepts.\\" References Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:History of human sexuality Category:Sexual orientation and science Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"How Sex Works"},{"id":"41923666","text":"Archaeology in Oceania is a triannual peer-reviewed academic journal covering prehistoric and historic archaeology, especially concerning Australia, the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and the western Pacific Rim.

Life  Born in , Andronikos was a son of the sebastos George Palaiologos and his wife Anna Doukaina. His father was the son of the first known member of the Palaiologos line, became a distinguished general and was among the most important supporters of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (), while his mother was the sister of Alexios' empress- consort, Irene Doukaina. Andronikos himself was named after his maternal grandfather Andronikos Doukas, which according to Byzantine custom probably suggests that he was the second-born son (his older brother Nikephoros bearing the paternal grandfather's name); Andronikos seems also to have preferred his mother's surname of Doukas, by which he is referred to in the sources. Like his father, he held the court dignity of sebastos, but his early life is obscure. P. Gautier suggested that he is to be identified with the logothetes ton sekreton Andronikos Doukas, active under Alexios I, possibly after 1109. The only definitive information about his career is that he served as governor of Thessalonica. The Timarion, a satirical dialogue placed in the city, alludes to him without naming him, while an act preserved in the Docheiariou monastery records the \\"pansebastos sebastos Andronikos Doukas\\" serving as \\"doux and praetor\\" of Thessalonica in January/February 1112. Andronikos died young of heart failure, predeceasing his parents. His death is placed . According to Demetrios Polemis, he was survived by his wife‚ÄîPolemis surmises that this was a daughter of the porphyrogennete Zoe Doukaina, youngest daughter of Constantine X Doukas and wife of Adrianos Komnenos‚Äîand was possibly the father of the megas hetaireiarches George Palaiologos (who may alternatively have been his brother), but Jean-Claude Cheynet and Jean- Fran√ßois Vannier believe that he had no offspring. The court poet Nicholas Kallikles wrote an epitaph and four other poems in his honour, and his parents were later buried in the same tomb following their death.

It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. It is one of the species considered a Japanese iris. It is from Asia, found between Russia, Mongolia, China, Japan and Korea. It has grey green leaves, an unbranched flowering stem and flowers in reddish-purple shades, from blue to blue-purple, red-violet, with a rare white variant. Description Iris sanguinea is often confused with Iris sibirica, another blue flowering Asian iris. But I. sanguinea has unbranched stems, while I. sibirica has branched stems. It has a thick creeping rhizome. It has grey- green leaves that are more or less the same height as the flowering stems, but as the leaves droop, they appear shorter. The linear, narrow leaves grow between 20‚Äì60 cm long and 5‚Äì13 mm wide. It has a hollow unbranched flowering stem, that grows up to between long. The stems bear two to three flowers, at the terminal ends in early summer, between May and July. It has three green spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are reddish at the base, measuring 5‚Äì7 cm long and 1 cm wide. It then has a brown papery tip. The flowers come in a range of reddish-purple shades, from blue to blue-purple, red-violet, with a rare white variants. The flowers are 6‚Äì8 cm in diameter. It has two pairs of petals, three large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and three inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'). The large obovate (shaped like an egg), drooping 'falls' have reddish-purple veins on a white or yellowish signal. The smaller, erect obovate standards are 4‚Äì5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. It has perianth tube of 8‚Äì10 mm long, 3 cm long white filaments, yellow anthers, a cylindric ovary 1.5‚Äì2 cm long by 3‚Äì4 mm wide, and a reddish- purple style branches 3.5 cm long by 5 mm wide. In July and September (after the iris has flowered), it produces a seed capsule, which is ellipsoid / cylindric in form and measures 3.5‚Äì5 cm long by 1.2‚Äì1.5 cm wide. Biochemistry In 2012, a genetic study was carried out on Iris laevigata and several of its closely related iris species, including Iris ensata, Iris setosa, Iris halophila, Iris scariosa, Iris potaninii, Iris tenuifolia, Iris bloudowii, and Iris sanguinea. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has been count various times; 2n=28, Simonet, 1928; 2n=26,28 Lee, 1970; 2n=28, Starodubtsev & Mironova, 1990; 2n=28, Huang, S.-f. & Zhao, 1995. 2n=28 is the most common listed count. This means it is similar to Iris sibirica and Iris typhifolia. Specimens from Primorskii Krai in Russia, were found to have a chromosome count of 2n=28.  Taxonomy showing the red- purple colour of the spathes of the iris ‚Äì giving its name as blood iris/Iris sanguinea Iris sanguinea is pronounced as EYE-ris san-GWIN-ee-a. It is written as Ê∫™Ëç™ in Chinese script and known as xi sun in China. In Japanese it is known as ayame and written as „Ç¢„É§„É°, ËèñËí≤, ÊñáÁõÆ in Japanese script. It has the common names of blood-red iris and blood iris. It was originally published as Iris orientalis by Thunberg in Transactions of the Linnean Society Vol. 2 page 328 in 1794, but the name had already been used for an iris within the series Spuriae Iris. It was first published as Iris sanguinea, described by Jens Wilken Hornemann in Hortus Regius Botanicus Hafniensis (In Usum Tyronum et Botanophilorum. Hauniae) (Copenhagen) issue 58 in 1813. But this was based on an earlier description by James Donn in 'Hortus Cantabrigensis.' Vol. 6, 17 in 1811. In 1981, in his book The Iris, Brian Mathew uses the name Iris sanguinea Donn. This was then used by other authors.(See Other Sources section) The Latin specific epithet sanguinea refers to the Latin word for blood, referring to the red-purple colour of the spathe valves of the iris. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 15 March 2002. Distribution and habitat Iris sanguinea is native to the temperate regions of eastern Asia. Range It is found between Russia (East of Lake Baikal in Siberia, Buryatia, Chita, Irkutsk, Amur, Khabarovsk, Magadan and Primorye), Mongolia, China (provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning and Nei Monggol), Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu and Shikoku) and Korea. Habitat It grows in damp meadows, along the edges of rivers and lakes, on the edges of forests, beside streams and on hillsides, at altitudes of around 500 metres above sea level. Cultivation Iris sanguinea is thought to be easy to grow. It is sometimes described as \\"prolific\\", meaning it can be 'invasive' when the conditions are optimal. It will tolerate temperatures of down to . It is hardy to USDA Zone 4‚Äì9, and Zone H2 (which means hardy to ), in Europe.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It is hardy in the UK, but will not survive wet winters in cooler parts of the world. The iris should be grown in well- drained, neutral to slightly acidic soils (the pH level should be more than 5.6) with plenty of organic matter, or loam. It prefers positions in full sun, but can tolerate partial shade (with some hours of sunlight). The plant needs moisture during the growing season (in spring and early summer) to create the best blooms. But they don't grow in the water, although they will tolerate occasional flooding. Propagation They are best propagated by division. The divisions must be not be allowed to dry out and can be temporarily stored in bucket of water, while the new planting position is prepared. The best time to divide plants is between August and September. To grow from seed, allow the mature pods to dry on the plant. Then break open to collect seeds and the direct sow outdoors in fall or autumn. The seed should germinate within three months, if they have been pre-chilled for four weeks or placed outdoors over winter. Once germinated they should be brought indoors (or place in a cold frame) to avoid temperature shock and then transplant outside, when the plant has four leaves. The climatic conditions of the garden, controls planting (or transplanting) times. In the north, they are best planted in the spring (avoiding frost damage to tender roots). In the south, they are best planted in the autumn (or fall), which avoids the hot dry period. They can be used in gardens, at waterside locations beside pools, ponds or streams. It is naturally propagated by pollinating insects such as bees which will feed on its nectar. Hybrids and cultivars Iris sanguinea has been hybridized with Iris sibirica, to extend the blue colour range.

Antiquity The acceptance of homosexuality in Dacian space occurs once with the transformation of Dacia into Roman province and the inoculation of Roman concepts of society and culture to autochthonous population. Middle Ages Middle Ages are characterized by social regression in the Romanian space, and the Christianization by Saint Andrew in Dobruja and the positioning on the border of religions (anti-Muslim shield) amplify bigotry. There is evidence of harsh punishment of homosexual acts although only for the poor, nobility enjoying all sexual privileges. However, examples of homosexual acts or relationships in that period can be retrieved in Dan Horia Mazilu's book, Voievodul, dincolo de sala tronului: * Ilia»ô Rare»ô would have converted to Islam to get sexual favors. His bisexual behavior is also mentioned by historian Dan Horia Matei, having as source the chronicle of Grigore Ureche. * Mihnea Turcitul is the alleged lover of Koca Sinan Pasha. * Alexandru Ilia»ô would have resorted to prostitutes, the best known being a Greek homosexual, Batiste Veveli, fact also mentioned by Miron Costin in his chronicle. Modern era * 1864 ‚Äì The Penal Code promulgated by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, inspired by the French model, does not stipulate any punishment for homosexual acts. At the end of the 19th century, the Penal Code in Transylvania, in force since 1878, punished only the homosexual rape, stipulated in Article 242. * 1929 ‚Äì Pamfil »òeicaru names writer Panait Istrati \\"poor poet of deflowered arses\\".

Bogza just published the volume of poetry Poemul invectivƒÉ. One of his creations is about a pederast. Nicolae Ceau»ôescu was also imprisoned in Doftana, in the 1930s, for communist agitation. After the Revolution, there were allusive discussions about homosexual relationships that young Ceau»ôescu would be maintained at Doftana with his colleagues of detention. * 1936 ‚Äì The Penal Code of Carol II passes in unlawfulness the consented homosexual relationship. Article 431 provides imprisonment for \\"acts of sexual inversion\\" when provoking public scandal. Thus, any act of sexual inversion brought to public knowledge could be punished with imprisonment from six months to two years. Under communist regime * 1947 ‚Äì The penalty for sexual inversion increases once with the installation of the communist regime. Thus, the mildest sentence was imprisonment for two years. * 1957 ‚Äì The Penal Code is amended again, pederasts being liable to imprisonment from three to ten years. * 1968 ‚Äì Homosexuality emerges as a linguistic term in the new Penal Code. Ideologically, homosexuality was unproductive for the Communists, who needed heroine mothers and an ascending demographic trend. The Grand National Assembly elaborates a completely revised version of the Penal Code, and sexual acts between persons of the same sex are considered crimes against the person and punished by Article 200: \\"sexual relations between persons of the same sex shall be punished with imprisonment from one to five years\\". * 1977 ‚Äì Ion Negoi»õescu, open homosexual, writes to anti-communist dissident Paul Goma, in sign of solidarity.

In 1804, Serbia gained its autonomy from the Ottoman Empire following two uprisings. Karaƒëorƒëe's Criminal Code (–ö–∞—Ä–∞—í–æ—Ä—í–µ–≤ –∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏ –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∏–∫) was subsequently promulgated by the Serbian Jurisprudential Council (Praviteljstvuju≈°ƒçi sovjet serbski) sometime in late spring or early summer 1807, and remained in force until 7 October 1813, when the Ottoman Empire re-gained control of Serbia.The full text was rediscovered in the State Archives in 1903, upon accession of Karaƒëorƒëe's grandson Peter I of Serbia to the throne. The Code penalised certain issues related to marital life and sexuality (such as forced marriage, rape, separation/divorce without the approval of a clerical court, and infanticide). It did not, however, mention same-sex sexual activity; and so homosexuality became effectively legal for a period of six years. Principality of Serbia (1815‚Äì1882) In 1858, the Ottoman Empire, of which Serbia was nominally a vassal, legalized same-sex sexual intercourse. However, the progressive reforms introduced by Prince Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá and Prince Mihailo were overturned when Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá returned to power. In the first post-Medieval Criminal Code of the Principality of Serbia, named \\"Kaznitelni zakon\\" (Law of Penalties), adopted in 1860, sexual intercourse \\"against the order of nature\\" between males became punishable by 6 months to 4 years imprisonment. Like in many other countries' legal documents of the time, lesbian sexuality was ignored and not mentioned.V.

National Liberation War 1941‚Äì1945 There are sources about homosexual Yugoslav Partisans during World War II in Yugoslavia. Milovan ƒêilas in his war memoirs tells the story from Sand≈æak where one Muslim soldier was exposed as homosexual by other soldiers and Regional Secretary. Regional Secretary in doubt ask ƒêilas if he should \\"execute this freak\\", while ƒêilas remains in doubt admitting that at the time he did not know Communist Party of Yugoslavia practice nor anything was said about such matters by Marx and Lenin. At the end under common sense he concluded that \\"from such vices suffer proletarians, and not only bourgeois decadent\\" but that he can not have functions or be party member. ƒêilas says that he only later learned \\"that that homosexual, who in appearance was sheer manhood, was very brave and courageously fell in battle\\". SFR Yugoslavia (1945‚Äì1992) The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia later restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to homosexual anal intercourse; but with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment. In 1990 in Hotel Moskva in Belgrade, which was popular gay gathering place in 70-ties, one gay and lesbian group began to organize meetings and in January 1991 they founded organization Arkadija. 21st century The first pride walk took place in 2001. As the walk progressed in Belgrade, it was stopped when protesters and police clashed with one another. In the years, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013, the LGBT community of Serbia scheduled a gay pride walk that received the treatment of getting banned each year by the authorities in the country. In 2008, the Serbian Medical Society determined that being LGBT was not a disease, being a member of the \\" World Health Organization\\", deferring from its opinions. In 2009, GayEcho declared Jelena Karleu≈°a to be gay icon in Serbia. In 2010, the pride march was attempted again. Similar results to the first march, this march was visited by thousands of individuals such as football fans and members of \\"right-wing\\" organizations. These individuals caused destruction, such as throwing missiles, stones, and setting cars on fire. The mayhem destroyed the walk, and also injured police officers. This march was overshadowed by 6,500 protesters. The pride walk was banned in 2011 which led the members of the gay community to believe that this act was a sign that supported violence towards gay people. Those in the Serbian LGBT community feared for their lives, due to severe cruelty by people with homophobic mindsets. Risks of violence continued to be high in Serbia against the LGBT community.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=mnh&AN;=21774599&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site Fourteen percent of respondents who took a survey, felt as if acts of violence was a proper way to respond to homosexuality. Boris Melicevic was an openly gay leader for Serbia who became a part of a political party in December 2010. In 2010, Serbia passed the \\"anti-discrimination law\\", which protected LGBT Serbians from being treated unequal. More than half of Serbians say that they are against violence and discrimination against homosexuals, however roughly two-thirds of the country believed that identifying as a homosexual was a disease. In May 2014, Amnesty International identified Serbia as one of a number of countries where there is a marked lack of will to tackle homophobia and transphobia, noting that public authorities had repeatedly banned pride marches on the basis of violent threats from homophobic groups. A pride parade successfully took place in September 2014 in Belgrade. In 2016, the association ILGA-Europe ranked Serbia 28th in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries. In June 2017, Ana Brnabiƒá became the Prime Minister of Serbia, as the first woman and first openly gay person to hold the office, and the second female LGBT head of government overall (after J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir of Iceland). She was also the first Serbian Prime Minister to attend a pride parade.

The firm was established by Maurice Jeanson in Asni√®res at 139 Boulevard Voltaire.  The cars  The business started out with a range of cycle cars, identified as the Benjamin \\"Type A\\", Benjamin \\"Type B\\" and Benjamin \\"Type C\\", a two-seater coup√©. The \\"Type A\\" was powered by a 4-cylinder unit of 751cc: it weighed less than 350 kg and therefore enjoyed the favourable tax treatment available to cyclecars. The \\"Type B\\" used a 2-cylinder 547cc engine, while the \\"Type C\\" was a sporty version of the \\"Type A\\", the volume of its 4-cylinder engine increased to 817cc. In 1924 the smaller engined Benjamin was replaced by the \\"Type AR\\". It sat on a wheelbase and was powered by a rear-mounted 2-stroke twin cylinder 450cc or 525cc engine. Thanks to the success of the early models the manufacturer broadened the range with a \\"Type P2\\" and a \\"Type P3\\", but these were less successful. The \\"Type P2\\" was built on a wheelbase and used a 2-stroke twin cylinder engine, of 550cc, and was produced from 1924. The \\"Type P3\\" had a 2-stroke triple cylinder engine. The cylinders were the same size as on the \\"Type P2\\", but there were three of them and the engine capacity was given as 817cc. (Other sources quote engine sizes respectively of 750cc and 1125cc for the 2 and 3 cylinder \\"Type P2\\" and \\"Type P3\\" in 1924.) In October 1924, at the 19th Paris Motor Show the manufacturer's listed prices started at 5,500 francs for a 2-seater \\"Type AR\\" cyclecar, while a Torpedo bodied 2-seater \\"Type P2\\" was listed at 8,900 francs.  Restructuring and renaming  Following the construction of a second factory at 39 Rue de Paris in Gennevilliers the company launched a new range, powered by engines bought in from Chapuis- Dornier. The company was now restructured and renamed as Benova. With a rapid rise in consumer incomes during the mid 1920s the cyclecar era was coming to an end, and the manufacturer moved into production of standard-sized motor cars, including even one powered by an 8-cylinder engine - albeit a small one. At the 22nd Paris Motor Show in October 1928 Benova were exhibiting three models: :* The \\"Benova Type B3\\" used a Chapuis-Dornier 4-cylinder side-valve engine of 0.95-litres and sat on a wheelbase. Standard bodies included a 2-seater Torpedo, a 4-seater Torpedo and a 2-seater coup√©. :* The \\"Benova Type E2\\" used a Chapuis-Dornier 4-cylinder overhead-valve engine of 1.1-litres and sat on a wheelbase. Standard bodies included a \\"Torpedo de luxe\\" and a 4-door \\"conduite interieure souple\\" (sedan/saloon). :::Both B3 and E2 were also listed in \\"commercial\\" versions with a drop down opening hatch at the back and, according to one picture, a removable back seat. :* The \\"Benova Type G\\" used a S.C.A.P. 8-cylinder side-valve engine of 1402 cc (later, if briefly, increased to 1996cc) and sat on a wheelbase. Standard bodies listed included a \\"Torpedo grand luxe\\", a 4-door \\"conduite interieure souple\\" (sedan/saloon) and a cabriolet.

Governorate of Livonia  In entertainment culture the crossing of the gender, for example cross- dressing, was a popular way of attracting the audience. One of the performers, ‚Äòimpersonators‚Äô known in Europe, whose act was dancing as the opposite gender, started his career at the local opera in Riga in 1903. Since that time KƒÅrlis Lencs, as he was called in Latvian press, had performed in Berlin, Paris, London, America, but in the Autumn of 1934 had arrived in a tour to Riga land also had performed in other places in Latvia - Vecauce, Durbe, Saldus. Such entertainment was available in Riga not only in 1903, but also in 1911. Intersex actor, Jespe (hermaphrodite), performed in cafe \\"≈†ata\\". \\"The actor sings very well, he also really likes young junkers and he is ready to do anything for them. The best idea isto dine with him and in the most critical moment to leave, he will be distraught, but that‚Äôs nothing,\\" in a private letter one junker of Polotsk cadet corps advised to another. On the other hand, the male homosexual subculture in the cities of Russian Empire began in the 1870s to 1890s. At the beginning of the 20th century, two (more or less) formed subcultures existed at the forefront, artistically and intellectually, with known poets and artists, and the sexually commercial bathhouses, cheap hotels, certain streets and other places of male prostitution. Just as in Western Europe, in Russia, homosexual relationships were most common in closed educational institutions, such as cadet corps, Junker schools, and so on. However, before The World War I in Latvian artistic environments same-sex sexual relationships between men was a taboo subject, so even in letters and memoirs of homosexual people nothing might be interpreted unambiguously as they do not include definitions of sexual identity. Therefore, today one might see only homoerotic hints in the texts of R≈´dolfs Blaumanis, as well as in the seemingly passionate letter greetings of writer Ivande Kaija to poet Aspazija. The rule that criminalised so-called ‚Äòcopulation between men‚Äô () was introduced in the Russian Empire in 1832, along with the first collection of the laws of the Russian Empire. It was called Article 995, which stipulated sanctions only for anal intercourse between men and prescribed that for such behaviour sanctions are imposed: taking away all rights assigned from personal situation and property situation, and exilement of the arrested to correction departments for time from 4 to 5 years, usually to Siberia. Moreover, if the sentenced person was Christian, he had to repent his sins in such a way his congregation leader prescribed. Attempts to decrease the sanctions for the behaviour mentioned were successful. On 22 March 1903, Article 516 of the criminal code prescribed prison time no less than three months. However, this Penal code was not implemented. The ‚Äôold' Article 995 was in effect in the Russian empire until 1917, when bolsheviks seized power in the former Russian Empire. During the early 20th century, the legal regulations of same-sex relationships in Western Europe were various. Since 1810, when Napoleonic Code was announced in France, they were decriminalised. Such example was followed by many other countries which created laws based on the experience of France mostly Catholic countries such as Italy, Belgium and Spain, as well as mixed denomination countries, such as the Netherlands. Meanwhile, same-sex relationships were criminalised mainly in protestant countries (Denmark and Sweden), as well as countries where Protestantism dominated among the denominations, such as the Great Britain and Germany. Such judicial regulations were also adopted by Austria and Hungary, where Catholicism dominated, as well as some Swiss cantons. It was the different experience of judicial regulations that became a tool used by defenders of decriminalisation of homosexuality to make arguments, that those voluntary same-sex activities between adults is a crime without a victim. Particularly strong movement of homosexual emancipation existed in Germany with the demand to abolish Paragraph 175. In other countries, scandals related to homosexuality took place and were discussed: however, there was not much information about them in the Latvian press. The legal process (1895) against Oscar Wilde, who was convicted on the charge of pederasty and sentenced to two years of forced labour, was widely reflected in the Russian press. But in the Latvian press, it was mentioned only after 1905. Moreover, the authors of the publication did not even specify the crime he was charged with, but used a euphemism: \\"violation of morality\\". In 1908 newspaper, \\"Dzimtenes Vƒìtnesis\\" described the lawsuit (1907) of Prince Phillip Eulenburg, a friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, against Maximilian Harden, the editor of Journal \\"Zukunft\\", who in several publications had described the homosexual pleasures of the prince and other nobles. The newspaper also used the terms \\"homosexualism‚Äù and \\"homosexualist\\" emphasising that as in Latvian language, \\"there is no name for such human depravities\\" many might not understand what does the charge of homosexuality mean?\\". The author explained that the first German Chancellor Bismarck had called the clique of prince Phillip Eulenburg \\"kinaids\\", and using equivalent Latvian words, \\"dog asses\\". Such statement were based in tradition that was reflected in the Latvian folklore, where the most valued masculine model was denoted by phallic symbolism (rooster, bull, foal, eel), but physically defective, socially lower and sexually deviant men were characterised by symbols of a dog and a wolf. The researches of European sexologists about homosexuals were translated and republished in Russia soon after their publishing. The ethnographical essay \\"The third Gender of Berlin\\" (1904) by German sexologist and homosexual movement activist Magnus Hirschfeld was published in Russian translation four years after the original. The research about \\"sexual inversion\\" by British Doctor, writer, social reformer Havelock Ellis, which was banned in England, was published in Russian only after 1909. Essays about \\"the intermediate gender\\" written by English socialist, philosopher, homosexual movement activist Edward Carpenter, was published in 1916 with the permission of military censorship. Meanwhile, the most influential Russian specialist was Veniamin Mikhailovich Tarnovski, professor of Imperial Military Medical Academy in Saint-Petersburg, with the book about perversity of sexual desires published in 1885. Until the World War I commercial books that introduced to \\"the world of perversion\\" were published in Russia and the theme of homosexuality was widely used by Russian writers in their works. The option to read these texts, at least theoretically, existed in the territory of Latvia. World War I and Latvian War of Independence The war gave opportunities to cross the gender lines without punishment. Led by the idea of patriotism, young women dressed up as men to have the opportunity to fight. Some managed to join Latvian Riflemen units in World War I (there are six known women) and during the Latvian War of Independence. War was one of the exclusive attributes of masculinity, therefore those few women who managed to obtain the permission to fight at the front-lines, were given male names in documentation. Lƒ´na ƒåanka-Freidenfelde, one of the three women cavaliers of the Order of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis in August 1915 with the documents of her brother JƒÅnis ƒåanks, volunteered at the Latvian riflemen battalion and fought as a man for some time. In 1916, Emƒ´lija K. from ƒ∂emeri, was attached to one of the riflemen battalions as \\"Pƒìteris K\\". She received respect among her war comrades because she \\"just beat up\\" those who intrusively tried to show her their affection. World War I created the emancipation of awareness of homosexuality in the territory of Latvia. Due to the wars large inhabitant masses (and experiences) moved. Migration paralysed the usual mechanisms of social control. Unprecedented possibilities appeared to realise the seemingly impossible, to see what had been unseen until now. In general, that encouraged people to become aware about the diversity of sexual practice. Transgender people used the situation of war to start their lives in their desired gender. During wartime, Alvƒ´ne Osis replaced documents to become Arvƒ´ds Osis and joined the army to affirm the new identity. A soldier, who in the beginning of 1919 during the Latvian War of Independence, had served in the North Latvian brigade created in area of Vidzeme occupied by Estonian army, married as a woman. In 1923, the soldier wanted a divorce and asked the clerks of Riga registry office \\"to change them from a woman to a man\\". It meant giving out documents that would confirm the respective gender. At the time when there were no possibilities to change the I gender by surgery it was the most radical thing that could be demanded. Information about the emancipation of homosexuality in territory of Latvia during the wartime is rather scarce and fragmentary. For example, an entry in a document that the person X is \\"a pederast from the last war 1914-1918\\", or a note that the accused had his first homosexual experience during the World War I, while serving in army. The documents of post-war Court of Honour of the Latvian Armed Forces indicated that such behaviour among the professional soldiers during \\"peacetime\\" was condemned. For example, a homosexual Lieutenant Colonel, who was a board member of Riflemen Society, that is, he participated in World War I as an officer, was forced to retire. The war did not encourage homosexuality, but it made it easier for men who were already homosexual to have same-sex relationships, overcoming the social and sexual oppression that had been dominant in their lives before then. Hence the war created an interesting paradox. Despite its traumatic nature, war gave homosexual people an alternative environment where they could ignore repressive traditions and to find out their identity. It made it easier for men to investigate their sexual desires outside traditional social structures and 'mechanisms of social monitoring'. For example, the experience of war for one group of the German homosexual community provided the modern image ‚Äî a gay man as a warrior and the rhetoric that was against the idea that homosexuals have feminine nature. The war built the self-identity of homosexuals, for example, in Germany homosexual men saw military as the opportunity to show their patriotism, masculinity and their integration with society. Sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld researched the influence of war on homosexual men. From 1914 to 1918 soldiers from the frontline sent him thousands of letters, pedantically telling about their homosexual experiences. On one hand, the army considered homosexuality unnatural and immoral, but on the other hand exactly in the military environment homosexual men \\"emerged\\". A soldier wrote that war gave him opportunity to educate his fellow soldiers and dispel the negative stereotypes. Homosexual relationships became more noticeable, and homosexuals were tolerated because they shared the front-line experience with the others. Incidentally, during the World War I a common part of entertainment if USA Navy were men, who played female parts in theatre. Likewise, British Army paid artist corps that did the same, to perform at the front-lines of Great Britain. The colourful but problematic dressing op of men as women seemingly renewed gender norms in a homosocial (based only on male relationships) soldier community. Dressing up as women on stage symbolically resolved the oppression of sexuality. The Republic of Latvia (1918‚Äî1934)=Legal framework After World War I, on 18 November 1919 the Republic of Latvia was founded and it defined 22 March 1903 Criminal Code of the Russian Empire as its Penal Code. In different parts of Latvia, they were in force before the county founded. The occupying power of Germany had declared the Criminal Code as the Penal Code in the administrative region (including Kurzeme and Latgale) of the Commander-of-Chief of the whole Eastern front. Whereas in the German occupied Vidzeme they came into force in February 1918. Latvian People's Council, already on 15 March 1920, adopted the law about the implementation of the criminal code in Latgale. It means, that in certain places of Latvia the penalty for committing acts of pederasty was decreased already during World War I. Article 516 of the Penal Code named \\"Immorality\\" prescribed a prison sentence of at least three months for these acts. From 1 August 1933a new law was introduced. The new Criminal Code was developed and implemented by Latvian lawyers. Now in accordance with Article 496 a man could be punished for the aforementioned behaviour with a prison sentence, and did not impose a specific time. That meant the Judge could also give a smaller sentence instead of the three months required before. Forensic medical expertises of \\"homosexualism\\" carried out by regional or city doctors in Latvia from 1922 to 1938. In Latvia, within 17 years, doctors carried out 87 forensic medical investigations on men, trying to find physical marks that \\"would prove homosexual behaviour\\" (carrying out acts of pederasty). The territorial belonging of them is noted in 82 cases. The most experiments were carried out in 1935. 12 of 21 experiments concerned Talsu District and 7 in Riga. The majority ‚Äî 7 of the 11 expertises registered in 1931 were carried out in Tukuma district. In May 1926, the popular German sexologist, Magnus Hirschfield, who was homosexual, read lectures in Riga. But in November 1926, the police arrested several homosexual men and started a criminal case against them. The press called what happened \\"the Black Carnation club\\" scandal. The \\"–°–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –í–µ—á–µ—Ä–æ–º\\" newspaper interviewed Professor Ferdinand Neireter, the head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Latvian University, to find our what penalty awaited those arrested. The Professor reported that, according to the theory of Magnus Hirschfeld, homosexuality is inborn inclination which is influenced by the environment and the first sexual experience. Homosexuals cannot be considered mentally ill. Homosexuality also is not a compulsive mania. The intensity of their sexual desire is just as diverse as for heterosexuals, moreover there are homosexuals that during their lifetime do not carry out any homosexual acts. Professor explained, that conviction of homosexuality makes many people suppress their inclinations or live in danger, that their \\"crime\\" will be found out and making way for blackmail. And so in many European countries campaigns for abolishing the criminal convictions are increasing. He supported the appeal of Hirschfield to decriminalize homosexuality. The professor's reasons were such: \\"It is completely logical, because the country has nothing to do with what lifestyle is carried out by adults when they do not make any direct or indirect harm to social morality. The criminalization of homosexuality apparently stems from theological principles, because homosexuality disturbs the implementation of God's main commandment: \\"be fruitful and multiply\\".–ö–∞–∫–∞—è –∫–∞—Ä–∞ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∂–∞–µ—Ç —á–ª–µ–Ω–∞–º \\"–ß—ë—Ä–Ω–æ–π –≥–≤–æ–∑–¥–∏–∫–∏\\"? –ù—É–∂–Ω–æ –ª–∏ –Ω–∞–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å –≥–æ–º–æ—Å–µ–∫—Å—É–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤? –ë–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞ —Å –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä–æ–º –ù–µ–π—Ä–µ–π—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–º, –°–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä–æ–º, 16.11.1926 In 1927, medical examiner Alberts Lokenbergs carried out a forensic examinations on the accused in the \\"Black Carnation club\\" case. In the report he wrote: The court punished for a specific sexual act, not sexual orientation. The society, however, used the concept of pederasty in a wider context to denote same-sex relationships between men. The Criminal law did not mention female same-sex relationships at all, therefore formally making them legal, because it's possible that to acknowledge that one woman 'seduces' another, would mean the admission of the possibility of female sexuality that is independent from men, which would be contrary to the traditional notions. Public thought The most popular meeting places were the Vƒìrmane Garden, the Greeneries of Opera and public toilets. Men who were well off visited night restaurant Alhambra (it was located in two-floors in a wooden house on 25 Brƒ´vƒ´bas iela in the block between LƒÅƒçplƒì≈°a and ƒ¢ertr≈´das iela). Barmaids worked there alongside young men who were called \\"aunties\\". Relationships of such type were also available in Cafe \\"Stambul\\" (located at the beginning of Kri≈°jƒÅ≈Üa Barona iela), where around 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. it was occupied by young men with painted faces, waiting for their admirers. In those days the restaurant had separate cabinets where visitors could sit as in individual companies, where they could be unseen. Some homosexual people used them for intimacy. Several illegal, and therefore secret, entertainment venues existed and people commonly called them \\"clubs\\". In 1933 the nightlife route also included a lesbian club, which was located in an apartment in Tƒìrbatas iela. Householders and foreigners attended the club because the entertainment in it was the most expensive in Riga. No more than five or six men could attend a single show. While sipping expensive alcohol, they watched love scenes between women. If somebody was turned on, they could wait in vain for responses from lesbians. Women also attended the club, but they watched it from different rooms. The first extended account on homosexuality in written Latvian press was published in the autumn of 1924 in the newspaper JaunƒÅkƒÅs Zi≈Üas, retelling rumours that the surroundings of ViesturdƒÅrzs are a home to \\"pederast club\\" named \\"Black carnation\\". The name is said to be derived from a badge with a black carnation on green enamel, and that it is being used as a club pass. In public thought, a consistent metaphor was created ‚Äî homosexual men were henceforth called \\"black carnations\\". It caught on in society and until the soviet occupationThe German army started the offensive against Riga on 1 September 1917. The Russian Army withdrew, but Riga was under control of German army until the beginning of January 1919, when it was occupied by bolsheviks - the Latvian army group of so-called Red Army of Soviet Russia. in the Latvian country the word \\"homosexual\\" was euphemised with this metaphor. The scandal began in the autumn of 1926, when the head of the main storeroom from the Ministry of War Service Corps reported to the head of the administration of Riga Criminal Police. He told that in old Riga in M. ƒ∂ƒìni≈Üa iela 14 (now VƒÅgnera iela), several men are continuously meeting in an apartment with the involvement of the new soldiers of the local garrison and \\"during these meetings all kinds of unnatural sexual acts are carried out between men, including pederasty\\". However, it was rarely discussed in the press. The most important reflections about book published in the 1926-1927, when a lawsuit accusing several man of homosexual actions was started and settled. right One of the first portrayals in the cinema that was sympathetic to homosexual people, was the film \\"Anders als die Andern\\", which was filmed in the Republic of Weimar in 1919. In Latvia it was shown in the summer of 1920, with the title \\"Homosexualists or under the hereditary curse\\". In seven long parts, and it was advertised as psychological soulful tragedy, whose \\"scientific part of the drama is simulated under the known Professor N. Hirschfeld.\\" The advertisement enticed, saying it is closed to children under 16 and \\"don't miss seeing this picture!\\". Magnus Hirchfeld, the psychiatrist mentioned in the advertisement already in 1897 established the first homosexual movement in Germany with the goal to decriminalise pederasty. In 1919, he established Institute of Sexual Science and the so-called \\"third gender\\" theory (female heart in a male chest), became the most popular expert in homosexuality questions in Europe, and partly financed the filming of the movie. He gave lectures in Riga in 1926 and 1929. Cinema \\"Vitorija\\" in LiepƒÅja showed the movie \\"Homosexualist\\" on 9 August 1920, while in Riga it was shown in May (in \\"Maska\\" cinema) and June (\\"Moulin Rouge\\" cinema). The movie audiences considered the movie interesting and gathered a lot of public. One of the most persistent views about the homosexual people in inter-war Latvia is expressed in the conviction that mostly representatives of artistic professions, especially ballet dancers and actors, are homosexual. Journalist Oƒºƒ£erts Liepi≈Ü≈° who started his career in the beginning of the 1920s, has left such evidence in his memoires: \\"I immediately met Mierlauks in an official reception. \\"Come here Liepi≈Ü≈°, your tie is crooked,\\" he lisped in his aged voice, grasping against my cheeks with long fingers. Back then, I was a rather good-looking fellow; I already knew Mierlauks weakness, therefore I somehow dodged and turned sideways. Those deep psychologists maybe could explain it with a certain constant influence of exhibitionism, which is connected to the showing off on the stage and the game of discovering their \\"inner person\\", but it is a fact that among theatre artists, just as it is among ballet dancers there is a known number of \\"queers\\". In the rather short history of our theatre the term can be used on: Tautmilis-Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈° - he even chose a feminine second pseudonym: Upciemu Made, and Viƒºums Vƒìvers. A lot of anecdotes were told about Mierlauks, who was a rather funny character.\\"Oƒºƒ£erts Liepi≈Ü≈°. TƒÅlos atspulgos. Mana m≈´≈æa atmi≈Üas. Toronto. 1982, p. 97 Journalist Oƒºƒ£erts Liepi≈Ü≈° mentioned in his memories the actress Marija Leika and the owner of company \\"Piena Eksports\\", Austra Ozoli≈Üa-Krauze, to whom he, in 1934, rented out his large dining room in his house at Me≈æaparks. His text is a testimony to the fact that alludes to the existence of homosexual relationships between people were so shrouded, that today they cannot be understood without thorough examination of the context. \\"Austra, who was gifted with more than average intelligence ‚Äî with \\"male head\\", was in charge of \\"the tandem\\". Living with me, she borrowed for reading the book of social democrat Dr. ≈Ω. Karlsons published in A. Gulbja publishing house. She read about the physiological types after Kretschmer and made fun of the influence of various sex hormones to sexual deviances. [...] Marija Leiko headed the household of the renters. She made German meals with delight, such as ‚ÄûOchsenschwanzsuppe‚Äù ‚Äî bull tail soup. Both women drank a lot of strong coffee. Marija also smoked all the time. In those time pants were not in fashion for women, but Leiko walked around in blue skiers pants all the time.\\"Oƒºƒ£erts Liepi≈Ü≈°. TƒÅlos atspulgos. Mana m≈´≈æa atmi≈Üas. Toronto. 1982, p. 621-622 In the nine years (1925-1934) the \\"Aizkulises\\" journal was publishing disclosure of public figures' private lives. There were four (favourably neutral) news stories, which mentioned homosexuality. However, facts remain ‚Äî homosexual people from intellectually artistic community did not speak in public, even though in 1928 a call was made to the actor's theatre group. \\"In actor meeting a popular actor-director complained, that the competition of two theatres had come so far, that actor S. in an Actors Club had called the actors of the competitive theatre \\"homosexualists\\". The beautiful actor had asked his colleagues to take a certain position regarding the issue. The meeting had diplomatically declined to rebuke the offender, because the issue has a private nature and those who feel offended, should take it to the court.\\"Aktieri ‚Äî ¬´homoseksualisti¬ª. Aizkulises, 1928, #10, p. 8 Currently, construction of lesbian history in the case of Latvia, is problematic. The sources have only crumbs of information. Inter-war Latvian jurisprudence did not consider lesbians a subject; therefore, there are no traditional sources, namely, criminal cases, which are available about gay men. Lesbian relationships were explained both in the model of \\"mommy and daughter\\" and in independent relationships, which, for example, is evident in the cover illustration of graphic artist Sigismunds Vidbergs for \\"Eross\\" journal in 1925. It draws in with the aesthetics of a lesbian couple ‚Äî in the picture two boyishly slender women are observed by a man who is hiding behind the doors. A less favourable attitude against female same-sex relationships is evident in the poem of the humorist, Roberts Vizbulis, where the condemnable occurrences of fraud and corruption were caricatured as two lesbians (\\"two shifty ladies\\") in 1926. Newspaper \\"PƒìdƒìjƒÅ Brƒ´dƒ´\\" called the relationship of two Rigian women \\"unnatural\\" and themselves ‚Äî abnormal women. One of them was the spouse of a rich wood seller but the other, because of her, had called off the engagement with a public sector employee. The women had frequently walked in ƒÄgenskalna priedes in the evenings. One of them dressed in women's costume, the other in man's sport costume with newsboys cap on the head. Therefore, one was feminine and the other ‚Äî masculine. The newspaper based the \\"abnormality\\" of the masculine partner on her hobbies ‚Äî \\"she had driven with men's bicycle, gone to the circus and admired the wrestlers and the neighbours had frequently seen her playing football in the yard. Moreover, one day at dawn her husband had caught her in a hotel room grasping and kissing a maiden, who had been half naked\\". Both left Latvia together. The feminine one had written to her brother that she is more satisfied with Mrs. B, than her groom, meanwhile Mrs B had informed her husband that the young woman \\"fulfils the place of a lover\\".  Authoritarian period (1934‚Äî1940)= Legal framework  If the police considered the facts, discovered through investigation enough to move the case forward, they gave materials to the prosecutors of the Regional Court, which instituted decrees for surveillance. The 21 decrees instituted by the prosecutor of Riga Regional Court are stored in Latvian State Historical Archives of the State Archives of Latvia. However, police gave the prosecutor only those investigation notices, where there was seemingly enough evidence, therefore the number of investigated incidents probably exceeded the number of the surveillance decrees of the prosecutor. Statistics of criminal cases litigated in the Riga Regional Court: * 21 surveillance decrees: 13 in the parliamentary democracy + 8 during the authoritarian regime * 21 surveillance decrees: due to the absence of evidence the investigation was terminated in 15 cases, in 1 surveillance decree episode the investigation was terminated against one of the people surveyed ‚Äî due to the death of the accused (from illness). * 6 criminal cases: 1 in parliamentary democracy + 5 during the authoritarian regime. In one case tried, during the parliamentary democracy the court sentenced with the minimum penalty (three months in prison). Two of the three convicts asked for pardon to the president Gustavs Zemgals and were pardoned. In 4 of 5 criminal cases that were tried during the authoritarian regime the judge sentenced with the lower penalty than the traditional three months in prison: ** three men were sentenced with four months in prison, sentence being suspended; ** one was sentenced to one month in prison; ** one with 2 weeks under arrest, but another 10 days under arrest, their sentences were suspended; ** one with 3 weeks under arrest, another ‚Äî with one month under arrest, a third ‚Äî 2 weeks under arrest, replacing the sentence with court warning ** in the fifth criminal case the judge gave a harsh sentence ‚Äî the person was sentenced to 8 months in prison.  Public thought  When speaking about homosexuality in relation to authoritarianism, the rumours about homosexuality of KƒÅrlis Ulmanis ‚Äî the leader of the authoritarian regime, are frequently mentioned. His opponents and opponents of his authoritarian regime spread the rumours. In a socialist handout spread in the summer of 1934 he was named as the leader of depraved sexualist club \\"Black Carnation\\". The Pƒìrkonkrusts National Organization called the Minister of Foreign Affairs the \\"muse of Ulmanis\\" and an \\"intimate friend\\" in their writings that exposed the authoritarian regime. An anecdote in the Memoirs of social democrat has become the most popular \\"evidence\\". In 1927 when he became the minister of Foreign Affairs, he secretly created an alternative office to the political administration with as leader. In reports he received it was rather frequently noted that \\"dearest Vilhelms\\" has once again spend the night at Ulmanis place. \\"Of course what Ulmanis actually did with Vilhelms is unknown ‚Äî maybe he played cards or dominoes or other heavenly games. However, these observations increased the rumours about the homosexuality of Ulmanis,\\" wrote Cielƒìns, saying that he mentions it publicly for important political motives. \\"Currently I will say only that Ulmanis' love for Vilhelms later acquired very substantial societal and political importance, because when he became a dictator he gave his Vilhelms a very high and a responsible office. Soon Riga was full of rumours that Vilhelms' wife was a Soviet Russian spy, but Ulmanis loved his Vilhelms so much that he fully trusted him. Yes, it is true that love makes people blind...\\" However, only the rumours about the homosexuality of KƒÅrlis Ulmanis are a historical fact and we can only talk about the possibility that he was gay. The Soviet period (1940‚Äî1991) The facts are fragmentary and are not sufficient to judge the period as a whole. 12 people persecuted for the violation of part 1 of article 124 within the framework of six criminal cases in the 11 months of 1969. 993 men were sentenced across the USSR in 1969, 641 of the men were sentenced in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The other 14 Republics sentenced 352. How many were sentenced in Latvian SSR is unknown. The stages of surveillance of homosexual people in the Soviet Union: * The period of Stalinism until the end of the 1940s: the surveillance of homosexuals was under the competence of security Police. Its archives are still unavailable, therefore it is unknown how many people were arrested for this crime, using the article that provided sentencing for anti-soviet activities. * 1951-1960: \\"a gap\\" in statistics. During these times the surveillance of homosexuals was most likely under the competence of general police. The legal framework was used with the goal to \\"clean\\" the persecutefor the behaviour, which was considered improper for the Soviet people. * 1961-1980: In the end of the 1960s the number of sentenced people in the Soviet Union sharply rose. This demonstrates that a modernised routine in the police surveillance existed: raids in subculture territories, entrapment, and the use of standard forensic medical examinations. The Soviet occupation implemented a repressive policy ‚Äî in the Republic of Latvia the sentence for pederasty was a prison sentence without a specific period, which in practice mostly meant a sentence up to three months. Meanwhile, in the Latvian SSR the sentence for the same offence was imprisonment from three to five years until 31 March 1961. As stipulated in Article 154a of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Penal Code. The USSR had already adopted this law in 1926 when homosexuality was de jure legal in the Soviet Union, but on 1 April 1934, the law was supplemented with Article 154a, which criminalized such behaviour. The Executive Council of the Higher Council of the USSR introduced it for interim use in the territory of Latvian SSR with the decree of 6 November l940. The interim period lasted for almost 20 years. Latvian SSR Penal Code took effect only on 1 April 1961, which decreased the sentence in a way, because it did not include a minimum sentence, but prescribed that pederasty will be sentenced with imprisonment up to five years according to the part 1 of Article 124. The commentators of the legal regulations maintained that mutual voluntary sex between men is a crime because it breaks the \\"social role\\" of sexual relationships, namely the norm that prescribes that sexual relationships should be between people of the opposite sex. \\"Both participants of such crime are acting with direct intention. They both are aware about the actual side of their actions and the danger to the society and want to in this way to satisfy their sexual desire\\". Regarding female same-sex relationships, the Soviet judicial framework did not differ from the practice of the Republic of Latvia ‚Äî Criminal Law did not mention such relationships, therefore, de facto legalizing them. The world and socialist context During the post-war years the persecution of homosexual men increased. The Netherlands and France still operated under the regulation adopted during the war which criminalized same-sex sexual acts between men were older than 21 and those underage. In France the sentence for violating the rules was imprisonment from 6 months to 3 years. However, same- sex relationships between adults were legal. The same was also true in Italy, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland. However, in Great Britain, Western Germany and the United States of America, sexuality was still being criminalized in the 1950s. As for so-called socialist countries in Europe homosexuality has always been legal such as in Poland, but Hungary and Czechoslovakia decriminalized same-sex relationships between adults in 1961. In the 1950s, one had to be very brave to dare to question the judicial regulations that criminalized homosexuality. Igor Kon The European Court of Human Rights were established in 1959, but did not accept cases related to same-sex relationships in the 1960s. However, in 1950 articles 8, 12 and 14 of Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms guaranteed the individual rights to privacy, formation of family on the basis of marriage, and the right not to be discriminated. In the 1970s, several professionals in the Soviet Union tried to talk about the need to change the legislation. In 1979 criminologist A. N. Ignatov sent a memorandum to the Office of Interior Affairs of the USSR. The historian-sexologist Igor Kon in 1982 made an unsuccessful attempt to publish an article about the legal regulation of same-sex relationships in \\"–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ\\" magazine. In the mid 1980s, when lawyers in Soviet Russia worked with new Penal Code project, police and medical departments talked about the decriminalisation of \\"pederasty\\" due to the influence of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika.  Public thought  Boulevard circles included locations that were used, not only to find partners, but also for homosexuals to be together. In Summer, Kalngales beach was also popular. Advertisement writings on the walls of men's public toilets were the alternative to interpersonal communication. For example, in the 1980s a popular place to relax was restaurant called \\"Skapis\\" (Closet) in \\"Rƒ´ga\\" hotel, which after World War II was built in the place of \\"Romas hotel\\" destroyed in the war. Homosexual people of inter-war Latvia also relaxed in the cellar restaurant. At the end of the 1970s, one of \\"Skapis\\" waiters was Lƒ´ga Strode, the future spouse of singer Kaspars Dimiters. They met in \\"Skapis\\" and now, in the 21st century as energetic warriors against homosexual movement, they are part of creating the modern history of homosexual people in Latvia. The possibilities for homosexual people to build a career were dependent on the ability to keep their sexual orientation secret. Frequently, it was a known secret among a company's staff, but it was not publicly talked about. Even if someone was fired because of their sexual orientation, another reason was cited officially. Meanwhile, the methods of getting a homosexual colleague fired were dependent on the imagination of the rival. Some, for example, wrote in satirical office publications expressing hints. In 1960 this was the approach of a staff member of Latvian University to get rid of docent S. \\"A. Stiebri≈Ü≈°, or as friends call him \\"bossy\\", a 46 years old male with thin stature and pinkish eyes. Always dressed particularly. Determines the worth of a person on the smoothness of the tie and the trouser seams. Intrinsic characteristics: nervous, slippery, with pliancy in front of bosses adequate to his surname, ex-teacher - who has retained the dictation method and pastor's tone in his lectures, corrects every comma in the diploma papers, drinks only the best cognac, gladly conducts different practices and in an intimate circle considers himself \\"a real Latvian patriot\\". Women hater.\\"Lƒ´kais Nazƒ´tis, ¬´≈†efi≈Ü≈° un jefi≈Üi. PamƒÅcƒ´ga luga divƒÅs ainƒÅs¬ª. ¬´Padomju Students¬ª. 1960.15.12 The publication of this in the 1960s had no consequences because in the student group, \\"the Members of Komsomol, did not have enough bravery to openly say everything they knew about the behaviour of S.\\". However, in 1962 the docent was fired. On 27 May 1980, the Central Committee of the Latvian Communist Party and Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR made the decision to investigate \\"the demographic situation and the means of natural growth stimulation of LSSR inhabitants\\". In 1980 Riga City Committee had worked out a plan with 26 measures centralised around \\"marriage\\" and \\"family\\". For example, in 1980 Article 23 required all Riga Party Committee schools, agitation and propaganda departments, the Committees of party regions, the region organisations of \\"ZinƒÅtne\\" society, the Executive Committee of Riga Health Protection, people's education departments, and the City Komsomol Committee, to develop a lecture course about the propaganda of \\"soviet lifestyle\\". This lecture concentrated on the questions of protection of mothers and children, and various aspects of marriage and the family. This was developed in the school year of 1980/81, so the youth in the \\"people's university\\" and faculties questioned marriage and family. Article 24 instructed the editorship of \\"Rƒ´gas Balss\\" to widely enlighten the general public about the current demographic situation. Namely to show them exemplary relationships in family and marriage and to inform them about how complex circumstances are created within the home. This is specifically targeted at the ensuring of optimal natural increase of the population and to increase the prestige of three or more child families. In 1980, Article 25 decreed that administrative departments of the City Party Committee, together with Goskomizdat book selling administration, should organise special sections in bookstores to sell books about marriage, family, pedagogy, and hygiene questions. The task of Article 26 was for the parties primary organisations of Creative Union to involve writers, journalists, artists, theatre employees, cinema, and television to create books, shows, and movies that show the image of \\"woman/mother\\", as well as raising the prestige of family and marriage. The book of sexologist JƒÅnis ZƒÅlƒ´tis was created due to the decision of Riga Party committee, clearly formulating its ideological position. The book \\"Mƒ´lestƒ´bas vƒÅrdƒÅ\\" (latv. \\"In the name of love\\") was published in 1981. It later became popularised with 99 000 copies printed and fully aligning with the party order. In the book there was only the \\"right\\" use of sexuality: \\"Real homosexuality includes pederasts - people that are dangerous, criminal against the society. When married they do not abandon the vices. The children are born into their families that are doomed to mental deformities because the lifestyle of the father (therefore an example) is solely a perversion. To recommend people of homosexual orientation to many before treatment is a serious mistake. Such homosexuals are dangerous to the boys in transitional age, whose sexual desire is not yet oriented; therefore they can be easily seduced and made miserable for the rest of their lives.\\"JƒÅnis ZƒÅlƒ´tis. ‚ÄûMƒ´lestƒ´bas vƒÅrdƒÅ\\". Rƒ´ga: Zvaigzne, 1981. p.80 Another quote from the book: \\"If the expectant mother has used hormones to end the pregnancy, smoked, or used alcohol, the children might have inclinations to homosexuality or other perversions. It can also happen in such cases the father of the child has been serious smoker, alcohol or drug addict.\\"  Gender reassignment surgeries  In 1968 the then docent Viktors Kalnbƒìrzs received a letter from a trans man, who over two years received complicated sex reassignment surgeries. With the support of the health minister of LSSR Vilhelms Ka≈Üeps, the surgeon started the surgeries in 1970. Overall, there were 18 complicated successful surgeries. In the summer of 1972 it could be ascertained that Kalnbƒìrzs managed to carry out the first full sex reassignment surgery in the Soviet Union. Kalnbƒìrzs received not only the congratulations from his colleagues and the certificate of authorship of the Inventions Committee of the Council of Ministers of USSR, but also a reprimand from the Ministry of Health of the USSR. A special committee of doctors analysed the surgeries and did not find any deficiencies. In the 1980s, surgeon Kalnbƒìrzs carried four more sex reassignment surgeries, all to trans men. The patients were residents of Russian SSR. Trans women also asked to reassign their sex surgically, but the surgeon had declined the opposite surgeries.

The test measures a person's ability to match the angle and orientation of lines in space. Subjects are asked to match two angled lines to a set of 11 lines that are arranged in a semicircle and separated 18 degrees from each other. The complete test has 30 items, but short forms have also been created. There is normative data available for ages 7-96. In 1994, Arthur L. Benton developed the test from his study of the effects of a right hemisphere lesion on spatial skills. Clinical performances In a study measuring JLO scores and on-road performance, JLO was correlated with better backing-up scores. Neurological disorders Patients with the following disorders often fail the JLO test: * Dementia * William's syndrome * Neurofibromatosis type I Patients with dementia often perform poorly on this test. It has been suggested that patients with Parkinson's disease perform poorly because of the complexity of task demands, not due to visuospatial deficits. Psychiatric disorders Studies performed on people with schizophrenia found no deficit in performance. Procedure The test consists of five practice trials followed by 30 test items. It is suitable for adult and pediatric populations. The test has two forms, H and J, which present the same 30 trials but in different order. Responses to prompts can be pointed to or spoken. Scoring A score of 17 or less is considered a sign of severe deficit.

Background=Facts Household International, Inc. was a diversified holding company with subsidiaries in the financial services, transportation, and merchandising industries. National Car Rental and Vons Grocery were among its wholly owned entities.500 A.2d at 1349. The board of Household International voted in August, 1984 to adopt a shareholder rights plan. This plan was adopted before the board was faced with any specific takeover threat--a significant difference from other takeover defense cases like Unocal. The board was concerned about the increasing frequency of \\"bust up\\" takeovers involving the break-up of large industrial conglomerates into smaller firms, and worried Household International might be the target of such a takeover. John Moran was a member of the Household International board who opposed adoption of the Shareholder Rights Plan. Moran was concurrently the chairman of Household International's largest shareholder, Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation. D-K-M had been contemplating a leveraged buyout of Household International, but this plan never materialized.

Life and career  Ponzoni and Pozzetto were childhood friends, and they grew accustomed to perform together in front of an audience of friends and relatives.Aldo Grasso, Massimo Scaglioni, Enciclopedia della Televisione, Garzanti, Milano, 1996 ‚Äì 2003. . Their professional debut took place in 1965 in the small cabaret club Cab 64 in Milan, where they performed along with Lino Toffolo and Bruno Lauzi. They were also joined by Enzo Jannacci and Felice Andreasi with whom they formed the comedy ensemble Motore, who had a good success in Milan. The couple became first known in the late 1960s thanks to the RAI innovative variety shows Quelli della domenica (1968) and √à domenica, ma senza impegno (1969). Characterized by a peculiar comic verve, filled with paradoxical and surreal moods, their popularity increased in the early 1970s with the variety show Il poeta e il contadino and with the participation with the musical show Canzonissima. The couple began to crack in 1974, when Pozzetto started devoting himself to a full-time film career.

She is also considered a great siddha and an emanation of Vajrayoginƒ´. She was born in Tibet and originally had the name Chime Butri. She was part of the prominent Sakya Khon family, which established itself by the 11th century in Sakya, Tibet. She studied with her uncle Kunga Lodro, who had had a vision prophesying, among other things, that she would be one of the closest disciples who would carry on his teachings. He transmitted to her the core Sakya Lamdre and the Vajrayogini teachings, among others. In 1782, she took novice vows from the twenty-fifth abbot of the Sakya Lhakhang Chenmo, Jampa Chokyi Tashi, who gave her the ordination name by which she has come to be known, Chime Tenpai Nyima. When Kunga Lodro died in 1783, she recited the Vajrayoginƒ´ prayers and accompanying offerings for his funeral rites. Her main disciple was Derge Drubpon Ngawang Rinchen. According to tradition, she gave him the Vajrayoginƒ´ teachings late in her life, when she could no longer see well, but her vision improved as she gave the teachings, and she told him, ‚ÄúSeeing a Lama like you in Tibet restored my eyesight.‚Äù Again according to tradition, when she gave him the Vajrayoginƒ´ blessing, during the inner blessing ritual the ambrosia in the cup started to boil spontaneously, and as he drank it, his understanding of emptiness expanded. She was also the teacher of four Sakya Tridzin (the heads of the tradition), as well as their brothers and children, abbots of Ngor Monastery, and many other tulkus and important teachers in the Sakya tradition. She was one of few women who had the authority to teach both Lamdre Tsokshe and Lobshe. It is unknown exactly when she died, but it is known she lived a long life, and she was called Rikmo Dung, or Old Noble Woman of the Rigdzin Palace. After she died, a memorial statue of Vajrayoginƒ´ with a silver crown and ornaments inlaid with precious gems was made to contain her relics, which was installed in the Lhakhang Chenmo at Sakya.

He started as quarterback for the Texas Longhorns for most of the 1983 season, the last undefeated regular season for Texas in the 20th century. In 1984, he moved to tailback and punt returner when Todd Dodge took over as quarterback. He also returned punts and kickoffs in 1981 and 1982. Moerschell is the last Texas quarterback to go undefeated as a starter over his entire career and one of the school's top ten punt returners of all time. Early life As a high school football player Rob Moerschell started out backing up future SMU star Lance McIlhenry, whom he would later start against and beat at Texas. In 1981, Moerschell led Highland Park High School into the playoffs after a perfect regular season with his only loss as starting quarterback at either the high school or college level coming in the high school state semifinals. After the season, he led the Texas team of high school all-stars to victory in the 1981 Oil Bowl game against Oklahoma, earning the game's MVP honors. He was all-district and the offensive player of the year at the district, greater Dallas and North Texas levels. He was also an all-district baseball player. Despite his success, he was only recruited by a couple of major schools due to concern about his lack of height.http://newsok.com/ut-qb-not-short-on-confidence/article/2041868/?page=2 College career Moerschell started his career at Texas as a backup quarterback but, because he was a good runner, he saw special teams playing time in both his freshman and sophomore seasons as a punt return and kickoff return specialist. He was the team's leading punt returner both seasons and had a career long 30 yard kickoff return in the 1982 game against Utah. He struggled to make it as a quarterback because he wasn't as strong a passer as other quarterbacks on the roster. In 1983, he was set to be the backup quarterback again, but starter Todd Dodge suffered a shoulder injury in scrimmage shortly before the season opener, giving Moerschell the start against Auburn. He split time with former starting quarterback Rick McIvor,http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121309/index.htm but Moerschell shone, proving he could run the option and throw the ball, and would spend the rest of the season trading the starting job with Dodge and McIvor. Moerschell started the next 6 games. He led Texas to a come-from- behind win over North Texas and an impressive victory over #7 Oklahoma, however poor performances against #8 SMU and Texas Tech, in which Dodge came in off the bench to win the game, gave the team back to Dodge. Moerschell regained the starting position three games later, after Dodge struggled against Houston and TCU.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/sports/long-run- brings-texas-back-20-14.html Moerschell started the next two games against Baylor and Texas A&M;, but in the second game, after Texas fell behind 13-0, he was replaced by Rick McIvor who led the team to score 45 unanswered points and gained the starting position, even though Moerschell provided key support in that game.https://www.chron.com/sports/college- football/article/In-83-McIvor-gave-UT-a-second-and-third-wind-1938669.php McIvor quarterbacked the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl that year, when a win would have likely secured them a National Championship, but a muffed punt return gave Georgia the opportunity it needed to score the game-winning touchdown. In that game, Moerschell came in on a few plays to run the option.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/03/sports/bulldogs-in-rally-upset- texas.html In his senior year, Moerschell was featured on the cover of Athlon's 1984 Annual Southwest Football preview, however he would not play much that season. Injuries at tailback and the emergence of Dodge as the starter, led to Moerschell being moved to tailback - a position he had played as a high school freshman - weeks before the season opener. He also was the team's punt returner. Later in the season, Coach Fred Akers did consider moving him back to quarterback when Dodge was injured in the Rice game.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat;=19841007&id;=QONHAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=G4AMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5240,2176151 In the tie against #3 Oklahoma he played a key role, controlling a high snap on the last play of the game and made the placement for Ward's game-saving kick. He played in every game, but had fewer touches at the end of the season. Moerschell finished his college career with a perfect 9-0 record as starting quarterback, the last Texas quarterback with a perfect career record. He also graduated as one of the top career punt returners in Texas history.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/tex/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/records- individual-special.pdf Personal life Moerschell introduced his sister Laura to former Longhorn quarterback Robert Brewer whom Moerschell had backed up in 1982, and the two were later married.http://insidetexas.com/news/story.php?article=1874 He is the uncle of Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Brewer and Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer.

Li Hongbo is best known for his lifelike paper sculptures, made entirely out of paper and glue. His work has been exhibited in museums around the world. Li's works have been exhibited internationally. Most recently, his works were displayed at Ludwigsburg Museum in Germany (2013), the 18th Biennale of Sydney in Australia (2012), and Klein Sun Gallery in New York (2013). Li's first solo exhibit in North America titled Tools of Study at Klein Sun Gallery, received worldwide attention. He now lives and works in Beijing, China.  Works  Li Hongbo's works are characterized by their unique media- paper and glue. Initially inspired by the idea of tradition and ubiquity that paper embodies, Li creates a hidden element of surprise in his paper sculptures that stretch in infinitely many ways. The static and emotionless state of the sculptures transform into unpredictable images, ultimately accentuating the difference between restriction and freedom. Each bust comprises roughly 7,000 to 26,000 sheets of white paper stacked on top of each other. They are glued manually in a honeycomb structure, allowing the resulting sculptures complete flexibility and sturdiness.

Its main character, Haji Radhi (Saleem Al-Basri) is a Hairstylist that doesn't know how to read and write, so he's an illiterate. His assistant, A'bousi (Hammoudi Al- Harithi) is a little bit crazy, but he dropped school at fifth grade, so he knows the basics of reading and writing.

The chapel contains several funeral monuments of the members of the Mellini family among them the works of Alessandro Algardi and Pierre-√âtienne Monnot. History The first patron of the chapel was a celebrated jurist, Pietro Mellini who belonged to a noble and ancient Roman family. The chapel, which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, is one of the original 15th-century hexagonal side chapels of the basilica. It has been the funeral place of the Mellini family for centuries. Originally it had two monumental Renaissance tombs facing each other, made for Cardinal Giovanni Battista Mellini and his brother, Pietro around 1478-83. A similar arrangement is still visible in other side chapels of the basilica. The appearance of the chapel was fundamentally changed when it was rebuilt by Cardinal Giovanni Garzia Mellini in the 1620s in Baroque style. The whole interior was covered with white and gold stuccos, and the vault was decorated with frescos depicting scenes from the life of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino by a Florentine artist, Giovanni da San Giovanni who was paid 130 scudi \\"as the rest and final installment of payment for the several works done\\" on 27 October 1627. The main altar was consecrated in 1628. The previous Renaissance tombs were dismantled to make way for the monumental Baroque sepulchres of Cardinal Giovanni Garzia Mellini in the 1630s and Cardinal Savio Mellini in the 1690s. In the middle of the 18th century the chapel was restored again and the main altarpiece was replaced by a similar painting of Agostino Masucci. The frescos of the vault were covered with a new cycle of paintings. These were removed in 1992-1993 when the original frescos of Giovanni da San Giovanni were revealed and restored by Bruno Zanardi except one scene where the 18th-century layer was retained.La verve di Giovanni da San Giovanni, Il giornale dell'arte, 1993, no. 113, July-August Description The altarpiece by Agostino MasucciThe interior of the chapel is covered with a rich white and gold stucco decoration which also extends over the outer surface of the entrance arch. The original Renaissance half-columns were embellished with Ionic stucco capitals with festoons and angel heads. The keystone of the arch is an escutcheon with crossed branches of lilies, a star and bread rolls (the traditional attributes of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino), flanked by two stucco half-figures holding garlands of fruit. The soffit of the entrance arch is decorated with angel heads, the dove of the Holy Ghost and decorative relief panels. The main altarpiece shows The Virgin with Saint Augustine and Nicholas of Tolentino. The huge Baroque painting is a late work of Agostino Masucci, a successful follower of Carlo Maratta, from around 1750. It replaced a previous painting by Giovanni da San Giovanni depicting the same subject which was mentioned by Giovanni Baglione in his 1642 biography of Italian artists.Giovanni Baglione: Le vite de' pittori scultori et architetti, Rome, Stamperia d'Andrea Fei, 1642, p. 314 (The previous altarpiece was recently identified as a painting in the Church of Sant'Agostino in Anagni.) The young Saint Nicholas of Tolentino is dressed as an Agustinian friar in black habit, kneeling before an altar with hands clasped in prayer. He is presented to the Virgin by Saint Agustine wearing episcopal robes and a mitre. The Virgin has descended from heaven on a throne of clouds poised above the altar, and she is accompanied by a retinue of putti, one of them holding a branch of lilies, the traditional attribute of Saint Nicholas. The older female saint behind the Virgin could be identified as Saint Monica, Agustine's mother. \\"The style with which the artist expresses himself in the realization of this work is noble and solemn. The figures are exalted by the monumentality of the upwards perspective and the wide gestures\\", wrote Maria Grazia Branchetti.San Nicola da Tolentino nell'arte: Dal Settecento ai giorni nostri, Biblioteca Egidiana, Convento San Nicola, 2007, 142. The altarpiece is framed by a sumptuous gold and white stucco aedicule with fluted Corinthian columns and a segmented, broken pediment which is crowned by the symbol of the Holy Spirit, a shell with garlands of fruit and two putti. The frieze has a decoration of acanthus tendrils and two winged mythological figurines flanking a six-pointed star. The antependium of the altar is a modern stone slab with a bronze relief of Saint Francis and the Wolf of Gubbio made by Goffredo Verginelli. The frescos of vault by Giovanni da San GiovanniThe frescos on the vault display The Story of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1623-27. The scenes are set in a richly detailed white and gold stucco frame and the eight panels are crowned with angel heads and ribbons. The central octagonal panel illusionistically opens toward the sky like an oculus; here the fresco displays the Glory of Saint Nicholas, the saint ascending to heaven among angels, one of them holding a lily. The original frescos of Giovanni da San Giovanni were hidden under the coarse 18th-century repainting until 1993. Although they were brought to light, the paintings remain in a precarious state and many of the finer details and the original colours were irretrievably lost. The 7 scenes are as follows (in clockwise order): 1) Episode from the life of Saint Nicholas 2) Death of Saint Nicholas (seriously damaged) 3) Saint Nicholas revives two roasted pigeons 4) Temptation of Saint Nicholas 5) Saint Nicholas distributes bread rolls to the sick 6) Saint Nicholas transforms the bread into roses (the only fresco whose 18th-century version was retained) 7) A miracle of Saint Nicholas (the 18th-century layer was totally different) The Allegory of TemperanceThe frescos depict two of the gentle miracles that made the Augustinian saint so beloved through the ages. Once when he was ill, the prior insisted that he should eat some meat although Nicholas was a vegetarian. He obeyed and touched the roast pigeons on the plate but the birds came to life and flew away. Another time he was caught by the prior taking too much food to the poor, but the bread hidden in his sleeves turned into roses. The scene where he distributes the blessed rolls, called Saint Nicholas' bread to the sick emphasizes his care for the ailing. Like many other saints he was frequently harassed and tempted by the Devil with apparitions (fourth scene). The frescos of the lunettes show the four cardinal virtues, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance and Prudence. They are set in semicircular panels with white and gold stucco frames decorated with garlands, shells and ribbons. The frescos were painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni and like the ceiling they had been covered with a layer of 18th-century repainting until 1993 when they were restored. The female personifications can be identified by the usual attributes: Justice - scale and sword; Fortitude - lion, column, helmet, mace; Temperance - glass of wine, chalice (?); Prudence - mirror, snake. In case of The Allegory of Temperance the 18th-century layer was totally different, depicting an angel mixing water with wine and the personification holding a bridle. The Allegory of Prudence was also heavily repainted, the 18th-century version was showing an additional angel. The entrance of the chapel is barred by a marble balustrade with richly carved wooden doors that are decorated with the coat-of-arms of Cardinal Mellini (the letter M and diagonal stripes). Tombs Giovanni Battista Mellini Drawing in the Royal Library which shows the original form of Giovanni Mellini's tomb The oldest monumental tomb in the chapel is the funeral monument of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Mellini (died 1478), the Bishop of Urbino and the younger brother of Pietro Mellini. Giovanni Battista played an important part in the reconstruction of Saint Peter's Basilica during the reign of Pope Sixtus IV. The funeral inscription mentions his mission as papal legate to Milan in 1477. The monument was dismantled by Cardinal Savio Mellini in 1698 who appropriated the architectural frame for his own tomb and placed the effigy of his forefather in front of the new monument. This effigy lies on a bier decorated with richly handled fruits and flowers. The drapery on the figure runs in one sweep from head to foot.Gerald S. Davies, cit. pag. 294-295 A 17th-century drawing in Windsor Castle preserved the original appearance of the tomb. Above the effigy there was a relief of Christ, the Man of Sorrows, being raised by angels from his tomb. The base of monument was decorated with the figures of two cherubs and the top was crowned with a shell pediment. Pietro Mellini The funeral monument of Giovanni Garzia Mellini by AlgardiThe tomb of Pietro Mellini (died 1483) is located under the 17th-century monument of Mario Mellini. The quattrocento tomb shows a Tuscan influence. It is sometimes attributed to Giovanni Dalmata. The effigy of the great jurist is \\"a simple figure of great dignity, such as marked the man in his own lifetime\\". The face looks like a trustworthy portraiture and the folds of the drapery are realistic. The supports of the bier are decorated with carved ornaments. The sculpture shows a strong similarity to the figure of Raffaello della Rovere in the crypt of the Church of Santi Apostoli, Rome. The monument was once of the same type as the tomb of Marcantonio Albertoni and Giovanni della Rovere, both in this church, but it was truncated.Gerald S. Davies, cit. pag. 117, 295-296 Francesco Mellini The oldest brother of Pietro and Giovanni Battista, Francesco Mellini, Augustinian friar and the Bishop of Senigallia, is buried under a tomb slab in the chapel. He was suffocated by the crowd at the conclave of 1431. The relief of the slab shows the full-length image of the Bishop, surrounded by a frame of trefoil arch supported on slender twisted columns with the family coats-of-arms in the upper corners. Giovanni Garzia Mellini The tomb of Cardinal Giovanni Garzia Mellini (died 1629), the vicar general of Rome was created by Alessandro Algardi in 1637-38.Cristina Ruggero: Monumenta Cardinalium, Vol. 2. p. 441 The monument was erected by the cardinal's nephews, Mario and Urbano Mellini but only after a conspicuously long time their uncle's death. The centrepiece of the monument is the white Carrara marble bust of the Cardinal in a niche which shows him leaning forward and turning towards the altar, his left hand on his heart and his right hand holding a prayer book. The work was much admired in Algardi's day because it conveys a sense of Baroque piety combined with expressive realism and brilliantly observed, technically perfect details. The monument itself is a classicising aedicule framed by flat pilasters with masks and crowned by a broken segmental pediment with the Mellini coat-of-arms in a conch. The big letter M, the main symbol of the family, recurs on the trapezoid sarcophagus (and the other Baroque tombs in the chapel). The Doric frieze is decorated with ecclesiastical objects (crozier, chalice, holy vessels and mitre). The voluminous epitaph follows the stages of Giovanni Garzia's prestigious career from his youth until his death, including his important diplomatic missions for Pope Paul V to Philip III of Spain and the warring Habsburg brothers of Emperor Rudolf II and Matthias. Urbano and Mario Mellini The tombs of Urbano (‚Ä†1660) and Mario Mellini (‚Ä†1673), distinguished soldiers of the Papal State, were placed in front of the windows. The monuments were attributed to Alessandro Algardi, and Wittkower claims that the bust of Mario \\"obviously echoes Bernini's Francisco I of Este and must date from after 1650\\".Rudolf Wittkower: Art and Architecture in Italy, 1600-1750, revised by Joseph Connors and Jennifer Montagu, Yale University Press, p. 175 The bust on Urbano's tomb was made well before 1660, probably in the mid-1630s, and its original designation is not clear, but it was suggested that Algardi made it as a model for the Cardinal's portrait.Cristina Ruggero: Monumenta Cardinalium, Vol. 1. p. 133-134 The monuments are almost identical with subtle differences. Both consist a trapezoid sarcophagus and the bust of the deceased which is set between volutes. The sarcophagus is decorated with the letter M on Urbano's tomb. The inscription states that the tomb of Mario Mellini was built by his son, Cardinal Savio Mellini \\"for the best of fathers\\". The bust was probably made by the workshop of Pierre-√âtienne Monnot, the sculptor who created Savio Mellini's tomb.Ruggero Vol. 1. p. 68 citing Walker The monument of Savo Mellini (with the tomb of Giovanni Battista Mellini) Savio Mellini The tomb of Cardinal Savio Mellini, the Bishop of Nepi and Sutri on the right hand wall of the chapel was made by Pierre-√âtienne Monnot, a French sculptor who worked in Rome. The strange monument was superimposed upon the older tomb of Giovanni Battista Mellini. The architectural frame of the Quattrocento tomb was partly reused. Two small reliefs with the personifications of the virtues and the cardinal's insignia on the side pilasters belong to that period. The monument imitates the more famous tomb of Giovanni Garzia Mellini on the left side of the chapel. The centrepiece is the marble bust of the Cardinal in a similar pose than his counterpart opposite. He looks toward the altar holding a book and a biretta. His head is covered by a zucchetto. The bust is placed in a deep rectangular niche which is clad with black and yellow slabs. The characteristically colourful Late Baroque composition is enhanced by a yellow marble inscription plate. The monument is crowned by a broken segmental pediment with the cardinal's coloured coat-of-arms. The French sculptor signed his work on the biretta of the bust: MONNO(T) F(E)CIT. The very long funerary inscription mentions fact the Cardinal Savio has served as papal nuncio in Spain for ten years, and later he was the cardinal priest of the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. According to the inscription his tomb was erected in 1699 (i. e. during his lifetime). A will dated to 9 September 1698 states that the statues of the tomb had been completed but the monument was still unfinished at the time.Ruggero, vol. 2, pp. 444-445 The cardinal planned his own tomb and apparently lived to see it erected because he died in 1701. The two flanking busts on the ledge are sometimes attributed to Monnot but according to Enggass they were made by another hand.Robert Enggass: Early Eighteenth-century Sculpture in Rome: An illustrated catalogue raisonn√©, Vol. 1, The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1976, p. 85 They portray the Cardinal's deceased brothers, Pietro Mellini (‚Ä†1694), general of the papal army, and Paolo Antonio Mellini (‚Ä†1683), commander of the papal troops at the Battle of Vienna against the Ottomans where he lost his life. Mario Mellini (‚Ä†1756) The large tombstone (in the floor) of Cardinal Mario Mellini (died 1756) is inlaid with a mosaic of colourful stones. The inscription says that Mellini was minister plenipotentiary at the Holy See of Maria Theresa, Empress and Queen of Hungary \\"in the most difficult times\\", and his tomb was erected by his nieces, Anna Serlupi and Giulia Falconieri and his nephew, Antonio Casali in 1760. The epitaph is set in a Baroque crest which is flanked by green olive branches and surmounted by the coat-of-arms of the cardinal. The allegorical figures of Prudence (left with mirror in her hand) and Fortitude (right with sword) are reclining on the top of the crest. The sepulchre was created by the mosaicist Carlo Lecchini after the design of architect Giuseppe (?) Ferroni.Fioravante Martinelli: Roma di nuovo essattamente ricercata nel suo sito, Rome, 1761, Eredi Barbiellini, p. 180 Gallery File:Santa Maria del Popolo Cappella Melini.JPGGeneral view File:Mellini fortitude.jpgFortitude File:Mellini justice.jpgJustice File:Mellini prudence.jpgPrudence Mellini chapel doors.JPGWooden doors with the Mellini coat-of-arms File:Francesco Mellini tombstone.jpgTombstone of Francesco Mellini File:Pietro Mellini Monnot Santa Maria del Popolo.jpgThe bust of Pietro Mellini, on the tomb of Savo Mellini by Monnot File:Cappella mellini, alessandro algardi, monumento al cardinale urbano mellini, 1639.JPGThe tomb of Urbano Mellini by Algardi File:Mario and Pietro Mellini tombs.JPGThe tombs of Mario and Pietro Mellini File:Mario Mellini tomb.JPGThe inlaid tombstone of Cardinal Mario Mellini (1760) NotesBibliography *Gerald S.

IPC providers manage the care of patients in coordination with primary care physicians and specialists in over 1,900 facilities in 28 states across the U.S. The company name is derived from an earlier company called In- Patient Consultants Management, Inc. and the NASDAQ ticker name was changed to IPCM in 2008. The company changed its name to IPC Healthcare in January 2015. The company was acquired by TeamHealth in 2015 for $1.6 billion. Adam Dean Singer (born in Los Angeles on April 20, 1960) has been director, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of IPC since he founded the company in 1995, and in 2006, was designated as the Chief Medical Officer. In 1991, Singer acquired a private practice in pulmonary medicine that shortly thereafter merged with two other pulmonary physicians to become part of Consultants For Lung Disease, Inc.  Controversy  The company disclosed that on June 7, 2010, it received a civil investigative demand (CID) issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois. The CID requested information concerning claims that IPC had submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. In 2011, the company was the subject of an investigative report looking at the use of hospitalists in San Antonio area hospitals and at the death of a patient under an IPC physician's care. A 2013 article published by JAMA raised concerns about the quality of care provided by hospitalists with excessive workloads. In 2013, the US Justice Department joined a \\"whistleblower\\" lawsuit against IPC, alleging that IPC physicians sought payment for higher and more expensive levels of medical service than were actually performed ‚Äì a practice commonly referred to as \\"upcoding\\". Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that IPC encouraged its physicians to bill at the highest levels regardless of the level of service provided, trained physicians to use higher level codes and encouraged physicians with lower billing levels to \\"catch up\\" to their peers. Class action lawsuits against the company for overbilling are now being contemplated by various law firms specializing in such claims. In February 2014, the former Attorney General of the State of Louisiana announced an investigation into whether IPC officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to IPC's shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws. In June 2014, the United States Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against IPC alleging that it submitted false claims to federal health care programs in violation of the False Claims Act by knowingly engaging in systematic overbilling for hospital evaluation and management services billed to Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health benefit programs. In February 2017, the company paid $60 million settle the False Claims Act qui tam lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois. The suit alleged that IPC encouraged and trained physicians in upcoding and utilized incentive compensation schemes linked to billing performance, which in some cases led to incentive compensation exceeding the physician's base salary.

Gelfand is a cultural psychologist, best known for being an expert on tightness‚Äìlooseness theory, which explains variations in the strength of social norms and punishments across human groups. She is currently a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park.  Education and career  Gelfand studied at Colgate University, where she graduated with a B.A. in psychology in 1989. She graduated from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 1996 with a PhD in social psychology and organizational psychology. There, she studied under the mentorship of Harry Triandis, one of the founders of cross-cultural psychology. She was on the faculty of New York University from 1995 to 1996, and she has worked at the University of Maryland, College Park since 1996. Gelfand is the editor of several academic books and series, including Advances in Culture and Psychology, which she co-founded; Psychology of Conflict and Conflict Management in Organizations; and The Handbook of Negotiation and Culture. She was the president of the International Association for Conflict Management from 2009 to 2010.  Research  Gelfand has conducted research across many cultures, using field, experimental, computational, and neuroscientific methods to understand the evolution of cultural differences and their consequences for individuals, teams, organizations, and nations. Gelfand has also done work on the role of culture in negotiation and conflict and the psychology of revenge and forgiveness.  Cultural tightness‚Äìlooseness  Gelfand is considered a pioneering researcher on the concept of tightness‚Äìlooseness. She is credited with defining the tightness- looseness classification system, which assesses how much a culture adheres to social norms and tolerates deviance. Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. Gelfand found that a history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. Her research has shown that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats. This work is summarized in the book, titled, Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World (2018).

It was initially proposed to consist of 504 hotel rooms and a 34,500 square foot casino located at Albany Avenue on the Boardwalk. It was to be the southernmost hotel/casino on the Boardwalk, adjacent to the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino. Due to financial and legal difficulties, the hotel was never completed and a casino license was never issued. History Development initially consisted of the purchase of the President Motor Inn and Mayfair Apartments at the site. Construction began in 1979 with the demolition of the President Motor Inn and the project was involved in the Abscam investigation. The project was halted in 1980 due to lack of financing, at which time it consisted of a two-story skeleton structure.

He was born as Anders Jensen in Hokksund as a son of fisher Jens Jakob Paulsen (1832‚Äì1865) and Regine Christensdatter (1831‚Äì1913). After basic schooling he worked in timber floating and timber trade, commencing merchantry in his homedistrict √òvre Eiker in 1898. In 1902 he moved to the farm Horgen in Nedre Eiker, running it for the rest of his life. He was supposedly converted to socialism in 1888 after participating in the liberal workers' movement, where he met and heard Christian Holtermann Knudsen and Christopher Hornsrud. He was first elected to √òvre Eiker municipal council in 1898, and served as mayor from 1907 to 1916. He first fielded for parliamentary election in 1909. With shoemaker B√∏hmer as his running mate, he carried the sub-constituencies Nedre Eiker, R√∏ken and Hurum, but lost Lier to Conservative candidate Torger Holtsmark with quite a margin. In total Horgen had 1,904 votes compared to Holtsmark's 2,056, so a second round was necessary. Here, Holtsmark edged out Horgen with 2,951 to 2,504 votes. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from the constituency Buskerud in 1912, 1915 and 1918, serving three terms. In 1921 he joined the new Social Democratic Labour Party, and headed their ballot in Buskerud in the 1921. The party got the fewest votes, and he was not elected. By 1930, the two parties had merged, but Horgen had instead joined the Communist Party. He stood on second place on their unprevailing ballot in the 1930 election. He died in June 1947.

It is now a senior living center. The H-shaped two story brick Art Deco building was constructed in several stages between 1915 and 1937. The building originated with a central portion that was built in 1892, to which two sides of the H were added in 1915. In 1937 the original 1892 central portion was demolished and replaced by the present central section. The building served as the town's high school until 1957 when it was used for junior high and middle grades in the Athol-Royalston Regional School District. It served that purpose until 2003. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. It has been converted to residential use. Description and history The Old Athol High School is located on a plateau above a bend in the Millers River, about east of the downtown center of Athol. It is located on the north side of School Street, from which it is separated by a low stone retaining wall dating to the 19th century. Its H shape is oriented with one opening of the H to the south, and the other to the north. The right leg of the H has a widened northern end. Each of the wings is fronted by two bands of three sash windows on each level, which share stone sills and lintels and are divided within each group by panels of dark brick. The central pavilion has groups of four windows on either side of the main entrance, similarly styled except that the dividing panels are considerably narrower. The main entrance projects slightly, framed by a surround with Art Deco stylistic elements. The town's first high school was built on this site in 1856. A new school was built here in 1892, as part of a program for greatly expanding the town's schools in response to rapid population growth. Continued growth prompted the addition of the two wings in 1915, which were designed by George Funk and William Wilcox. The central pavilion was built in 1937 with funding support from the federal Public Works Administration, a Depression-era jobs program. This section was designed by J. William Beal and Sons, a firm working out of Boston with credit for a number of school designs in the state. The Art Deco style of this element, popular at that time, is extremely rare in Athol. In 1957, a new high school was built after the town joined with Royalston to form a combined school district, and this building was used as a junior high school. It was closed in 2003, and adapted for residential use as a senior living center in 2012.

A natural form of traffic calming, sneckdowns show where a street can potentially be narrowed to slow motor vehicle speeds and shorten pedestrian crossing distances. Coined by Streetsblog founder Aaron Naparstek, popularized by Streetfilms director Clarence Eckerson, Jr. and spread widely via social media, the term first appeared on Twitter on January 2, 2014 at 11:19pm EST. Other Twitter hashtags that have been used to describe snow-based traffic-calming measures include #plowza, #slushdown, #snovered and #snowspace. Benefits * Shortens pedestrian crossing time * Highlights unused road space * Calms vehicle traffic * Allows planners and road engineers to clearly see possible modifications to road structures * Encourages slower vehicle speeds, increasing safety for all road users, including pedestrians * Reduce asphalt surfaces, increase plant surfaces, improve the absorption of rainwater by the soil, reduce runoff and floods Drawbacks * Narrowing road also reduces time for driver to react when pedestrian steps on the road * Large vehicles are wider than their tracks on snow, so pedestrian can be hit by vehicle mirrors, corners or outstanding parts of the vehicle body/trailer * In case of a traffic collision narrow road is blocked * On narrow road there is no way to yield to emergency vehicles as required by the rules Examples Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ‚Äì Baltimore and 48th Street: A sneckdown inspired permanent upgrades to the pedestrian environment at this intersection in 2011.

The Oblates of Jesus the Priest is a Roman Catholic religious congregation of sisters. Founded in Mexico in 1924, this congregation is now represented in Mexico, the United States, Italy, and Ecuador. Their charism is ‚Äúto love the priesthood and to make it loved,‚Äù so the apostolates of the sisters predominantly center on assisting priests and promoting the priesthood. These include, but are not limited to, ministering in seminaries, aiding retired priests, sewing vestments, assisting in rectories, working as secretaries for bishops, and conducting religious education in some parishes. The Oblate sisters are also very musical, emphasizing singing and playing instruments during their liturgies and sometimes writing their own music. The prayer life of the order is especially Eucharistic with at least a half hour of Eucharistic adoration every day for each sister, as well as daily Mass, Liturgy of the Hours, and Rosary. As this congregation is part of the Family of the Cross, their spirituality is centered on the Spirituality of the Cross. Essentially, this spirituality emphasizes that Jesus was both priest and victim when he died on the cross, and so by uniting oneself with him, even in the mundane events of daily life, it is possible to also be mediators and offerings to God. The motto of the order is ‚ÄúIn Oblation to the Lord‚Äù. Currently, the number of sisters worldwide is close to 120, with thirteen of their twenty convents located in Mexico. In the United States, the sisters, numbering around 22, can be found in the archdioceses of Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. History alt=The Oblates of Jesus the Priest was founded in Mexico City on February 9, 1924, by Venerable Fr. F√©lix de Jes√∫s Rougier, MSpS, a French priest who first came to Mexico as a missionary in 1902. Fr. F√©lix founded four congregations during his lifetime, all of which live under the same Spirituality of the Cross. These congregations are the men‚Äôs community known as the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit (1914) and three women‚Äôs congregations: the Daughters of the Holy Spirit (1924), the Guadalupan Missionaries of the Holy Spirit (1930) and the Oblates of Jesus the Priest. The Oblates were founded in Tlalpan, Mexico City, on February 9, 1924. They first became an association of the faithful on January 31, 1935, and on December 12, 1937, was approved as a congregation of diocesan right. On February 12, 1975, the Holy See elevated the congregation to the rank of institute of pontifical right. Originally a priest of the Society of Mary, Fr. F√©lix‚Äôs superiors eventually gave him permission to join the community that he founded for men. Throughout his many trials in founding these orders during the turmoil of the revolution, he was aided by a widow and mystic named Concepcion Cabrera de Armida, or \\"Conchita\\". Her many spiritual writings, numbering around 200 volumes, still encourage people today in every vocation to pursue holiness. Very shortly after becoming an official congregation, their founder Fr. F√©lix died on January 10, 1938. Fr. F√©lix and Conchita were both made venerable by Pope John Paul II ‚Äì Conchita on December 20, 1999 and Fr. F√©lix on February 15, 2000. Today the Oblates of Jesus the Priest continues to grow, and the Family of the Cross now includes eighteen religious and lay institutes. Fidelity to the Teachings of the Catholic Church The sisters are particularly devoted to the teachings of the Catholic Church: the magisterium and the Pope. Their annual participation in various events such as the March for Life and Walk for Life gives public testimony to the inspiration they have drawn from Pope John Paul II. In the United States, they have chosen not to participate in either the Leadership Conference of Women Religious or the Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious.

It is one of two relatively unmodified one-room schoolhouses in the town. Built in 1828, the brick schoolhouse is also one of the oldest surviving school buildings in the state. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The District No. 5 School is located in western Shrewsbury, on the west side of Old Mill Road just south of its junction with Main Street. It is a single-story brick structure, with a gable roof and a stone foundation. It measures about , with its long axis and roof oriented east-west. The eastern facade houses a single door, which provides access to the building. The north wall has four windows, placed slightly irregularly, while the south wall has only three. The west side has no windows, but also has evidence in the brickwork that there were once two windows. The interior of the school has a vestibule area, which then opens into the classroom. The wall separating the spaces is vertical tongue-and- groove, with an original Federal-period door. The classroom walls are finished in vertical tongue-and-groove wainscoting, with plaster above. Floors appear to be original random-width planking, fastened with cut nails. The town of Shrewsbury, incorporated in 1727, established a district school system in about 1742, and had seven districts by 1792. The present district 5 schoolhouse was built in 1828 on land purchased from Orville Lothrop, whose farmhouse still stands to the northwest across Main Street. The school was funded and maintained by district residents until the state abolished the district system in 1869, after which the school (like the town's other district schools) was taken over by the town. It remained in use as a public school until 1917, and its ownership apparently reverted to the Lothrops, but was later retaken by the town for nonpayment of taxes. From the 1940s to 1960s it was being used as a residence, and it was restored in the 1970s to a turn- of-the-20th-century appearance. The local historical society purchased the property from the town for $1 in 1974, with stipulations that it be used for exclusively historical purposes. It is now operated by them as a museum.

Life Xhemal Bushati was born Xhemal Shaqir Bushati in Shkod√´r, member of the Bushati family which ruled the Scutari Vilayet during the Ottoman Empire. He participated in two wars against the Montenegrin in Shkod√´r, during 1912‚Äì1913 and in 1920. His first appearance as a politician was in 1913‚Äì1914 as an opponent of \\"Sejadi Milet\\" organization, a pro-Turkish anti-Independence movement powerful in Shkodra at that time. He was also an opponent of Essad Pasha and his pro-Serbian orientation. On 26 July 1916, the armies of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes without any warning attacked Shkodra area from the Montenegrin border side (Hani i Hotit). Bushati was elected as one the civic resistance groups, operating in the area of Vraka. He participated at the Albanian assembly held in Bushat as a representative of Shkod√´r in 1919. There he cooperated with other government, cleric and people's representatives for generating a memo which was sent to the Paris Peace Conference where they opposed further partition of Albanian territories. Bushati was a delegate in the Congress of Lushnje. On 13 February 1920, two days after the new institutions were installed in Tirana (the new capital), the new parliament representatives Xhemal Bushati, Hil√´ Mosi, Ndoc √áoba, and Sabri Bushati represented a declaration in the name of Shkodra's population which unconditionally approved all the decision coming out of Lushnja's Congress. Bushati was elected member of the Albanian Parliament after the 1921 elections as representative of his home town. He cooperated closely with Luigj Gurakuqi as two main leaders of the Albanian parliamentary opposition of 1921-24 for the Prefecture of Shkodra. Of thirteen representatives, twelve belonged to the opposition. In 1923 he was elected Assemblyman and again Representative. In March 1923 he protested inside the parliament against the oppression and persecution that followed a revolt in Kor√ß√´. A supporter of the June Revolution, he was part of the Fan Noli's government as a Minister without Portfolio, representing the moderate-conservative branch of the Albanian politics together with Sulejman Delvina and Rexhep Shala. After the return of Ahmet Zogu in power he left the country and was initially stationed in Bari. After the assassination of Luigj Gurakuqi (still collaborating with him), Bushati left for Paris and after a few months in Vienna, Austria stationed later in Sarajevo. Bushati was a core member of the \\"Bashkimi Komb√´tar\\" (The National Union) anti-Zogist organization together with Sotir Peci, Sejfi Vllamasi, Angjelin Suma, and Ali Klissura founded in 1925 in Vienna. The organization members were financially supported by Yugoslavia. Bushati returned in Albania after the Italian Invasion but did not accept any governmental position. He died unexpectedly in August 1941. During the Communist Era his name was annihilated, and was restored after.

Built about 1827, it is one of the rural community's few surviving 19th-century brick buildings. It served as a school until 1920, and was thereafter converted to a summer residence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The West Brick School is located in northwestern Oakham, on the north side of Old Turnpike Road, between Scott Road and the Old West Cemetery. The school is a small 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof and a stone foundation. The gable ends are finished in wooden clapboards, with a window opening (typically covered by batten shutters) at the center of the south one. The front (south-facing) facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the left bay, topped by a transom window. Windows are set in all sides except the west side, which has no openings. The interior has a small entry hall, which opens into a single room occupying most of the interior. A storage space along the west wall was probably intended for storage of firewood. The interior has original flooring and walls, including vertical wainscoting and plaster. Interior doors retain original hardward and fastenings. The property includes the remnants of an old outhouse, and an organized roughly dome-shape pile of dressed stone that may have served as a base for a flagpole. The building was built c. 1827 on the site of an 18th-century schoolhouse, with brick that was probably sourced from a brickyard on New Braintree Road. It served as a school until 1920, when it was closed due to declining enrollment. The school underwent a number of alterations during this time, mainly due to state requirements governing school facilities. These were largely limited to improving ventilation during the heating season, and occasionally using shutters to manage light levels in the building.

He chaired the geology department at Oberlin College later serving as its provost and president. Powell also served as president of Franklin & Marshall College as well as Reed College. Following his positions in higher education, Powell presided over the Franklin Institute and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. Powell served 12 years on the National Science Board and is currently the executive director of Graduate Fellowships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Diversity. His book, Night Comes to the Cretaceous, explores the scientific debate regarding dinosaur extinction. In Four Revolutions in the Earth Sciences, Powell addresses dinosaur extinction in addition to three other scientific debates: deep time, continental drift and global warming. Powell has posited that the scientific consensus on global warming nears universality and he actively counters climate change denialism in his research and other publications.  Education  Powell earned a BA degree in 1958 from Berea College, a private liberal arts college located in Powell's home town of Berea, Kentucky. Powell then received a PhD in Geochemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962.  Career  Powell began his career at Oberlin College in 1962 where he held the position of chair of the geology department from 1965 to 1973. He became the associate dean of arts and science in 1973, then vice president and provost in 1975. After serving two years as a visiting administrator at Stanford University, Powell returned to Oberlin to serve as its acting president from 1981 to 1983. Following a 20-year career at Oberlin, Powell served as president of Franklin and Marshall College from 1983 to 1988, then president of Reed College from 1988 to 1991. Powell left academia to preside over the Franklin Institute (1991-1994) followed by the National History Museum of Los Angeles (1994-2001). Since 2001, Powell has been serving as the executive director of the National Physical Science Consortium. Powell served 12 years on the National Science Board first appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1986 and serving as its vice chair in 1990. In 2015, Powell was named a fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.  Debate on Climate Change Consensus  Peer-reviewed studies of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming Powell has researched the scientific consensus view of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in a series of studies evaluating the peer-reviewed literature. In 2012, Powell reviewed 13,950 peer- reviewed publications between 1991 and 2012 with \\"global warming‚Äù or ‚Äúglobal climate change\\" as keywords. Evaluating this dataset, Powell showed a 99.97% scientific consensus view supporting AGW. In 2016, Powell duplicated this method on articles published during 2013 and 2014. In this set, Powell found a 99.99% consensus \\"verging on unanimity\\" by the scientific community. While agreeing that the consensus on AGW is high, other scientists have argued that the consensus is closer to 97%. The debate centers around the selection of scientific papers identified as supporting AGW and therefore included in the study. For example, in their 2013 study, Cook et al. excluded 66.4% of the papers examined because the abstracts did not endorse AGW either explicitly or implicitly. Powell reviewed the abstracts of hundreds of articles on plate tectonics, evolution, and impact cratering to show that scientists almost never directly affirm the ruling paradigm of their discipline. On that basis, Powell included papers in the study as long as the abstracts did not explicitly reject AGW. Powell has further argued that the extent of the scientific consensus is important. In The Consensus on Anthropogenic Warming Matters Powell argues that the \\"stronger the public believe the consensus to be, the more they support the action on global warming that human society so desperately needs.\\" This metastudy included 54,195 publications from five earlier studies by Powell and others demonstrating that the scientific consensus on AGW is 99.94%. In November 2019, Powell published \\"Scientists Reach 100% Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming.\\" Powell, J. (2019). Scientists Reach 100% Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming. Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society. https://doi.org/10.1177/0270467619886266 He reviewed over 11,600 peer-reviewed articles published in the first seven months of 2019 but found none that rejected anthropogenic global warming.  Views and Scientific Activism  Powell has encouraged scientists to do more than publish in scientific journals. \\"I think it‚Äôs time for scientists to get up from the lab bench and speak out.\\" Concerning the consequences of global warming, Powell said: \\"I want my grandchildren to be able to say... he did something. He tried to do something.\\" There is no scientific debate regarding the existence of AGW according to Powell. Through his research and other publications Powell has criticized politicians and others who defy the scientific consensus by denying AGW. In a 2014 editorial, Powell urged the university presidents of Brown University and Harvard University to change course by divesting their institutions from fossil fuels. A New York Times editorial co-authored by Powell and Michael E. Mann recommended that the American Museum of Natural History remove Rebekah Mercer from their board as her family foundation supported climate change denialism.  Recognition  Powell is the recipient of several honorary degrees. Oberlin College awarded Powell an honorary doctorate of science in 1983. The Tohoku Gakuin University of Japan honored Powell with a Doctor of Humane Letters in 1986. Beaver College and Berea College (his alma mater) have also honored Powell with honorary degrees. The minor planet, 9739 Powell, discovered by Carolyn Shoemaker, was named for Powell in 1987.

In December 1912 she was imprisoned at Perth Prison for smuggling herself with others into the Music Hall Aberdeen. They had intended to disrupt a Liberal meeting with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George. She was imprisoned at Perth under the name Marion Pollock. Throughout 1913 and 1914 she wrote many letters to the press and was regularly removed from public meetings for being disruptive. Disguised in widow‚Äôs tweeds and glasses, she managed to get into a Labour meeting held by Ramsay MacDonald in the Gilfillan Memorial Hall, but was roughly dragged out by eight burly men ‚Äì an onlooker describes this as \\"one of the strongest arguments for women‚Äôs suffrage that I have ever seen.\\" World War I At the outbreak of war in 1914 she enlisted as a nurse with the Voluntary Aid Detachment at Caird Hospital, Dundee. In 1916 she joined Margaret Damer Dawson's Women Police Service, working first in a munitions factory and then serving in London as a Constable, then a Sergeant and, by 1918, had reached the rank of Sub- Inspector. She left the organisation at the end of the war. Political career After the war Grant became involved in politics and joined the Liberal party. To go from suffragette to policewoman to Liberal politician was a path also trodden by Mary Sophia Allen. By 1922 she was spending much of her time as a public lecturer on politics and social problems. She was then selected as a David Lloyd George supporting Liberal candidate for Leeds South East constituency for the general election. Her opponent was the sitting Labour MP James O'Grady who had been returned unopposed in 1918. As there was no Unionist candidate she polled a strong vote but did not win. After the Lloyd George and H. H. Asquith wings of the Liberals re-united, she stood as Liberal candidate in Pontefract, where the Liberal candidate had come third in 1922. Once again it was a three-cornered contest and Grant was unable to avoid a squeeze on the Liberal vote; She did not contest the 1924 General Election. By July 1928 she was selected as Liberal candidate for Salford West,Angus Evening Telegraph, 27 Jul 1928 another Labour/Unionist marginal where the Liberals were not expected to do that well. She again finished third. Later life In the 1930s she became a Christian Scientist and worked as a healer for 20 years. She undertook civil defence work in London during the Second World War. In 1953 she was disabled by a stroke. She died in August 1957 in Tunbridge Wells.

It originated on YouTube in 2007, when the VlogBrothers (John and Hank Green) rose to prominence in the YouTube community. As their popularity grew, so did coverage on Nerdfighteria, whose followers are individually known as Nerdfighters. The term was coined when John saw a copy of the arcade game Aero Fighters and misread the title as Nerd Fighters. Hank Green describes it as \\"a community that sprung up around our videos, and basically we just get together and try to do awesome things and have a good time and fight against world suck\\". He defines \\"world suck\\" as \\"the amount of suck in the world\\". The Greens established The Foundation to Decrease World Suck, in order to raise funds and launch projects that would help a variety of causes. Nerdfighters believe in fighting world suck, promoting education, freedom of speech and the use of the intellect in modern society. Nerdfighters and the Green brothers have collaborated on many projects such as the charitable drive, Project for Awesome which launched in 2007, and VidCon, the convention focusing on topics surrounding the world of digital media. Nerdfighters have been documented by websites such as The Hollywood Reporter, and The Wall Street Journal, with a following estimated to be in the millions. Community topics Nerdfighteria is known for its online collaborative nature: forums, spinoff blogs, meet-ups, and charitable events have been spawned by its members. Instances of the community collaborating can be observed in the creation of college campus groups at universities such as the University of Maryland, Texas Christian University, the University of British Columbia, and the University of California, Los Angeles. Another Nerdfighter club was founded at Auburn University, in which the members have stated their desire to do charity work with The Humane Society and This Star Won't Go Out. The Nerdfighter subculture was able to force the release of the novel The Fault in Our Stars five months early. Additionally, safety concerns caused by 5,000 fans crowding the stage at the 2014 Q&A; tour at the Dolphin Mall caused the event to be shut down early. Symbols and terminology A prominent symbol in Nerdfighter culture is a double-handed gesture with crossed arms, resembling the Vulcan salute from Star Trek. Celebrities such as actor Benedict Cumberbatch and Olympian Jennifer Pinches have been documented demonstrating Nerdfighter hand gestures. The symbol has been referred to as a Nerdfighter \\"gang sign\\" or a \\"salute\\". Additionally, the initialism \\"DFTBA\\", standing for \\"Don't Forget To Be Awesome\\", is generally considered the motto of the community. \\"World suck\\" is another word included in the Nerdfighter vocabulary, which refers to unfavorable things that occur in the world. To decrease \\"world suck\\", the Greens founded a charitable non-profit organization, in which Nerdfighters collaborate to promote social activism. Meetups Hank (left) and John Green at VidCon 2012 The collaborative nature of the Nerdfighter community has resulted in meetups, sometimes involving the Green brothers. In 2008, the Greens held an event in Chicago, which proved to be a turning point for both the Green brothers, as well as Nerdfighteria. Hank recalled the event as the first time he could sell his music, as well as a precursor for DFTBA Records. John added to his brother's comments, stating, \\"This was also the first time I met Rosianna, who is now my assistant, and the first time we really understood the power of nerdfighter gatherings, and it happened at the Chicago Public Library, one of the first places to get behind my novels in a big institution-wide way, and wow, what an important day in our lives.\\" The event would be the first of several meetups within the community, as the Greens founded VidCon, which was first held in 2010, attracting 1,400 in attendance. Censuses and Surveys The VlogBrothers enjoy connecting to their audience and community, which sometimes involves the use of surveys. In 2013, Hank Green began an annual \\"Nerdfighter Census\\". The census survey is hosted on SurveyMonkey, and its results are analyzed by Hank. In 2014, over 100,000 people filled out the survey. Hank discovered that 72% of the responders are female, 85% are non-Hispanic white, as well as mostly American between the ages of 13 and 30. Charity events and activism A video by Water.org thanking Nerdfighteria for a donation campaign A key component of the Nerdfighter community is the involvement with charity events and fan activism. Events such as Project for Awesome, have allowed a way for Nerdfighter involvement with charitable actions. Nerdfighters work closely with another group that promotes community activism, the Harry Potter Alliance. Nerdfighteria and HPA were able to raise $123,000 for Partners in Health, enough to send five cargo planes to Haiti, as a way to assist the citizens of Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. Kiva.org Nerdfighters Nerdfighters are the third largest community of lenders to Kiva.org, a non- profit organization which helps people lacking access to traditional banking systems by granting loans to them. Various instances of micro loans from Nerdfighters funding entrepreneurs in developing countries have been documented. Overall as of July 2016, more than 50,000 Nerdfighters have loaned a total amount of $7.2 million, ranking #6 all-time across all teams on Kiva.org. Exercising the interactive nature of the community, the Greens made a deal of sorts with Nerdfighteria: to have the community reach over $1 million in funds donated to Kiva before the Greens reached 1,000 videos on their VlogBrothers channel. Nerdfighters were able to accomplish this feat. Project for Awesome 2013 Project for Awesome logo A major event in the Nerdfighter community is Project for Awesome. The event, initially known as the \\"Nerdfighter Power Project for Awesome\\", launched in 2007, and occurs annually in December. On the topic of the overwhelming amounts the event has been able to raise, Hank has stated \\"YouTube was caught pretty off guard by the first P4A, but ever since then they've been hugely supportive.\\" During Project for Awesome, people post videos advocating for worthy charities, and the Nerdfighter community votes for the charities they believe are most deserving of funding. In 2014, this system was modified so that money raised on the first day goes to Save the Children and Partners in Health, and money raised on the second day goes to the community chosen organizations. This change was enacted so that wealthy charities feel comfortable donating to P4A and to ensure that some charities are reputable charities who are known to do a great deal of good. The first-day recipients in the 2015 campaign were Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. AFC Wimbledon Aside from charity drives, Nerdfighteria also offers funding and support for AFC Wimbledon, a third-tier football club in England. Ad revenue from John's videos on the Green brothers' YouTube gaming channel, Hankgames, go to sponsoring and supporting the football club. In January 2014, John Green became an official sponsor of the club, and later in the year the Greens' sponsorship led to a Nerdfighter logo design, with the DFTBA catchphrase being featured on the club's kits. In 2015, AFC Wimbledon was drawn to play a match against Liverpool F.C., who John has been a longtime fan of. Green flew to London to spectate the game in person. One of the spectator stands at Wimbledon's now-former stadium, Kingsmeadow, was named after John at the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season. In April 2016, John announced he would be making a \\"docudrama\\" with \\"comedic moments\\" about the story of AFC Wimbledon, set to be distributed by 20th Century Fox. This Star Won't Go Out and Esther Day Esther Earl Another non-profit foundation associated with the community is, This Star Won't Go Out, founded by Wayne and Lori Earl, in memory of their daughter, Esther. The name of the foundation stems from the fact that \\"Esther\\" means \\"star\\" in Persian. The program itself provides funds and assistance to families of children with cancer. Esther Earl was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2006, and, before her death in 2010, developed a bond with the VlogBrothers and the Nerdfighter community. John Green and Earl met and bonded at a Harry Potter conference in 2009. She would be involved with Nerdfighteria and YouTube, as she was a vlogging personality, until her death on August 25, 2010, at the age of 16. Shortly before her death, on August 2, 2010, the day before her 16th birthday, John uploaded a video in preparation for \\"Esther Day\\", which would be celebrated the following day. Earl stated she wanted the day to be about \\"family and love\\". Two days following her death, the VlogBrothers made a video titled Rest In Awesome, Esther, remembering her and all of her contributions to the Nerdfighter community, as well as the world. Nerdfighteria continues to keep her memory alive through her foundation, as well as Esther Day, which is celebrated each year on August 3. John Green states that Esther Day is the \\"most important holiday in Nerdfighteria,\\" and that Esther, herself, has become a hero in the community. Earl would later be known as the inspiration for the main character Hazel in John Green's novel The Fault in Our Stars, as well as its film adaptation.

A poverty of primary sources means that nothing is known for certain of his origins or early career. However, in later years he served successively as Praeses (governor) of the province of Numidia (i.e. Praeses Numidiae) and of Egypt, (i.e. Praefectus Aegypti). These were both very senior procuratorial offices, the latter in particular traditionally considered one of the pinnacles of an equestrian career. In these roles he exercised military skills in addition to administrative ones; as Praefectus Aegypti he led military operations outside his province. He died resisting the invasion of Egypt by the forces of Zenobia of Palmyra in the troubled inter-regnum between Emperors Claudius II and Aurelian. Despite the limited availability of information about Probus, the fact that he was: (i) entrusted with the government of two of the Empire's most economically and strategically significant provinces; and (ii) given important military command outside his province (at least during his time as Praefectus Aegypti) indicates that he had the reputation of a highly competent Imperial functionary. His known appointments suggest that both Emperor Gallienus and Gallienus's successor, Claudius II, held him in high regard. Probus was likely among the relatively small group of professional soldiers who benefited from the opening up of provincial governorships and senior military commands, which were previously reserved for senators.  Primary Sources = Literary  Probus is referred to by the Historia Augusta (SHA) in the Uita Divi ClaudiiSHA VC(11.1 f. under the name \\"Probatus.\\" In the garbled account in the Uita Probi recounting the campaigns of Marcus Aurelius Probus in North Africa and Egypt, the future emperor is credited with actions that other, more reliable, sources indicate should be attributed to Tenagino Probus.VP(9.1-5). The SHA mentions him only as a military commander, making no reference to his procuratorial status in Numidia or Egypt. Among Greek and Byzantine sources, Zosimus' Nova Historia records in fair detail Probus' military exploits during the period when he was Praefectus Aegypti, without actually identifying him by name. The text makes no reference to his earlier appointment in Numidia. George SyncellusSyncellus(721). and ZonarasZonaras(12.27). largely reiterate Zosimus, with some confusion of the material.  Epigraphic  A number of epigraphic inscriptions attest to the existence of Tenagino Probus and some details of his career. *In Latin, from Lambaesis, Numidia (now Lamb√®se, Tunisia).CIL VIII 2571 + 18057 (Lambaesis). Dated to 267-8 AD in the principate of Gallienus.PLRE(Probus, Tenagino 1). Probus is not mentioned by name, but the context suggests that the inscription relates to his term of office, an interpretation authoritative commentators generally accept. *In Latin, from Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi, Numidia (now Timgad, Algeria).(AE 1936 #58. This inscription names Probus, refers to him as praeses, and invokes the Emperor Claudius. It likely dates from soon after Claudius' accession to the purple in mid-268 AD, but before his election as consul for 269 AD at end-268.PLRE(Probus. Tenagino, 2.) *In Latin, from Thuburbo Maius, Numidia, (now Henchir-Kasbat, Tunisia).ILAlg II 24 = AE 1941 #33. This inscription refers to Probus as governor of the province and patronus of the colonia. The colonia referred to is probably Thurburbo Maius. The date is 269 AD, under Claudius.PLRE: Probus, Tenagino 3. *In Greek, from Claudiopolis (more usually known as Cyrene, Libya).SEG IX 9 = AE 1934 #257 The inscription refers to Probus as a diasemotatos (i.e. Vir Perfectissimus) and Praefectus Aegypti and invokes Claudius II as Emperor. It celebrates the victory gained by the Romans under Probus over Berber nomads in the neighbouring province of Cyrenaica. The inscription is usually assigned to late 269/early 270 AD.PLRE: Probus, Tenagino 4 and Barnes(1972:168).  Origins and early career = Origins  No literary or epigraphic evidence exists to shed light on Probus' origins. Onomastic analysis of his nomen (i.e. his family name) suggests that \\"Tenagino\\" was quite rare. Only two occurrences of the name are recorded, both in northeast Italy: Tenigenonia (sic) Claudia;CIL V 3345 (Verona) and Q. Tenagino Maximus.Pais 715 name(Anauni). These inscriptions might indicate that Probus originated in this region, but are not conclusive. However, Probus' nomen does indicate that his family's citizen-status pre-dated the Constitutio Antoniniana of 212 AD. This may mean that the family were people of substance.  Early career  No available information speaks to Probus' early career. Some evidence indicates long-term military service, but it is unknown whether he was already of equestrian status when he enlisted in the army. Probus's first known gubernatorial appointment was as Praeses Numidiae. Until at least 260 AD, and possibly even later, Numidia had been a propraetorial province, i.e. it had been governed on behalf of the Emperor by a senatorial Legatus Augusti (an official who had previously held office in Rome or elsewhere as a praetor). However, the epigraph from Lambaesis, Numidia, (above) indicates that by 267 AD (during the sole reign of the Emperor Gallienus), the governor of Numidia was officially titled praeses. (The title praeses did not always indicate that a governor was of equestrian rank, but in the case of Numidia he was, as were all known subsequent governors of that province.) As noted, it is now generally assumed that Probus was the official referred to in that inscription, even though his name has disappeared from the text. Indeed, he may have been Numidia's first equestrian governor. Therefore, it is highly likely that Probus was an early beneficiary of Gallienus's policy of giving equestrians military commands (over legions) and administrative posts (as governors of propraetorial provinces) that, prior to Gallienus' sole reign (260-268 AD), had been reserved almost exclusively for men of senatorial status.  Procuratorial career = Praeses Numidiae  The function = The loyalty of the Praeses Numidiae was important to whomever governed the Roman Empire for a number of reasons: # Numidia was one of the main sources of grain and olive oil, essential staples of the Roman diet, making the area a key resource underpinning the emperor's ability to control Rome and supply the armies stationed in Europe. # The governor of Numidia commanded the Legio III Augusta based at Lambaesis, the only significant military force in Roman north Africa (which spanned from the boundaries of Egypt to the Atlantic coast of Morocco). This legion was ostensibly meant to defend the north African provinces from the nomad populations on its southern boundaries, but for the most part this task was, arguably, not suited to a unit whose chief strength was its heavy infantry. The legion was an instrument at both too powerful and too blunt for that job.Shaw(1995:IX, passim). Instead, the strategic vision of the Imperial government seems to indicate that the chief role of the governor of Numidia as head of his legion was to uphold the Empire's authority, both in Numidia and in the entirety of the resource-rich African region, particularly the neighboring province of Africa Proconsularis. During the reign of Gallienus and his successors, Africa Proconsularis rivaled Egypt itself as a granary of Rome. In this sense, the Emperor regarded the governor of Numidia as his \\"man- on-the spot\\" in Africa, and the legion commanded by the governor as the ultimate sanction of the Emperor's ability to exploit the region's strategic and economic benefits for the Empire's own purposes. # After the loss of the western provinces to the \\"Gallic Emperor\\" Postumus and the de facto secession of the eastern provinces under Odenathus of Palmyra, the Numidian garrison constituted the only substantial reserve of military manpower available to Gallienus in Europe as he faced the Scythian inroads of 267-8. For these reasons, Probus' appointment as Praeses Numidiae demonstrates that he had established a reputation for competence and earned Gallienus' trust. = Probus in office = No reliable information exists about Probus' period of office in Numidia. The SHA suggests that, like his predecessor during the regime of Maximinus Thrax, Probus may have been called upon to intervene in Africa Proconsularis to put down an insurrection in Carthago. However, the balance of academic opinion is that this story the sort of invention in which the SHA seems to delight and should, therefore, be rejected. The same passage in the uita goes on to assert that \\"Probus\\" slew a \\"certain Aradio\\" - no further explanation - in single combat before honoring him with a magnificent tomb. This too is generally rejected,e.g. Barnes(1972:168). although some authorities are prepared to concede that it may be authentic.e.g. Saunders(1992:428).  Praefectus Aegypti  Strategic significance of Egypt = As noted, the epigraph from Claudiopolis (above) is generally interpreted to mean that Probus had taken on the role of Praefectus Aegypti before the end of 269 AD. Ever since Augustus' conquest of Egypt in the first century BC, the emperors of Rome had regarded their absolute control of this territory and its grain harvests as a sine qua non for the maintenance of their authority. Loss of control of Egypt would almost immediately undermine the Imperial government's ability to maintain control of the Roman people. The Emperor's absolute trust in the praefectus of Egypt was considered even more vital than that of the praefecti of the African provinces. Therefore, from the principate's earliest days, its praefectus had always been an equestrian, presumably because most equestrians lacked a personal power base comparable to a senator's, making equestrians more likely to remain loyal to the princeps. When Claudius II appointed Probus to this office, he demonstrated that he (Claudius) had the utmost confidence in Probus, even though Probus had been a proteg√© of Claudius' predecessor Gallienus. = Probus' term as praefectus = Claudius II further demonstrated his confidence in Probus shortly after Probus assumed the praefecture of Egypt, when Claudius commissioned him to intervene militarily in the neighboring senatorial province of Creta et Cyrenaica, which had suffered an incursion by the Marmaritae. The Marmaritae were, evidently, a nomadic people who roamed the semi-desert territory known as the Marmarica, which lay west of the Siwa Oasis in western Egypt and to the south of Cyrenaica. Traditionally, Emperors hesitated to allow governors to undertake military action beyond the boundaries of their own province. However, as demonstrated in Numidia, forces stationed in Imperial provinces could be deployed in neighboring provinciae inermes (lit. unarmed provinces) when necessary, and the text of the epigraph from Claudiopolis (above) suggests that the Marmaritae were increasingly becoming a nuisance in Cyrenaica. The epigraph refers to the Marmaritae's \\"audacity\\" and suggests that Probus dealt with the incursion with effective dispatch - although, as was always the case, the victory was officially attributed to the reigning Emperor (i.e. Claudius). In the inscription, Cyrene is referred to as Claudiopolis (i.e. \\"City of Claudius\\") in the Emperor's honor, although it is unclear whether this was intended to celebrate the defeat of the Marmaritae. Shortly after Probus' success in Cyrenaica, Claudius gave him a further commission to undertake a naval campaign against Gothic pirates who had been raiding the islands of the eastern Mediterranean and the southern coast of Asia Minor. Only Zosimus records this action.Zosimus: Nova Historia: I:44.2. However, recent archaeological discoveries in the Turkish province of Antalya suggest that, even as Claudius was concluding his war against the Scythian migrants in the Balkans, he had dispatched an expeditionary force under Lucius Aurelius Marcianus to repel attacks by Gothic pirates along the southern coasts of Asia Minor. It is thought that this force cooperated with Probus' naval force. Zosimus reports that the pirates were driven away \\"without achieving much\\" - an outcome that he attributes entirely to the efforts of Probus, but which was more likely the result of a combined operation.  Final campaign and death  Zosimus contains the fullest account of Probus' final campaign and death. While Probus was away fighting the pirates at sea, Zenobia began a drive to extend her authority over Asia, Arabia and Egypt. One Timagenes, otherwise unknown, led a strong pro-Palmyrene faction in the population (and possibly in the Imperial garrison) in encouraging the targeting of Egypt in particular. In support of Timagenes, Zenobia's general Septiminus Zabdas invaded the province at the head of an army of 70,000 men and, together with his local allies, defeated the Egyptian loyalists who had mustered an army of 50,000. Zabdas then returned to Syria, leaving behind a garrison of 5,000, presumably in Alexandria. When this news reached Probus, he returned to Egypt with the force he had led against the pirates and, with the support of those sympathetic to the Imperialist cause in Egypt, drove out Zabdas' garrison. Zabdas returned, but he was again defeated by Probus, the pro-Imperial Egyptian forces and \\"soldiers from Africa\\" - no further explanation. Probus then seems to have followed Timagenes upriver to the fortress of Babylon (located at the head of the Nile delta, now a suburb of modern Cairo), thus cutting off the enemy's escape route to Syria. However, using his knowledge of the surrounding country, Timagenes seized the summit of a nearby mountain with 2,000 men and, launching a surprise attack on Probus' army, defeated it utterly. Probus was captured and, in the Roman heroic tradition, chose to kill himself rather than bear the ignominy of defeat. The Uita Divi Claudii broadly repeats this account, but describes Timagenes a Palmyrene general rather than an anti-Imperialist Egyptian. Papyrological and numismatic evidence suggests that Zabdas began his assault on Egypt in the autumn of 270 AD and by the end of the year had brought it firmly under the control of his mistress Zenobia.Saunders(1992:152-5).

The company announced Speedback GT, its first model, in March 2014 in London. The vehicle's public debut was at the Top Marques show in Monaco on 17 April 2014. Despite sharing a similar background in engineering, and the same name as previous owner of Aston Martin, there is no family connection between the two companies. Mini Remastered, a modern reinterpretation of a classic Mini, is the company's second model, launched in Shoreditch, London on 6 April 2017. The company showcased Speedback GT at the Geneva International Motor Show in 2017, and again in 2018 alongside two examples of Mini Remastered and the newly launched Speedback Silverstone Edition.

The bespoke body of each Speedback GT is produced using traditional coach building methods; the aluminium body panels are hand beaten and then rolled over an english wheel. The bucks over which the panels are beaten have been milled out using a 5-axis CNC milling machine from CAD data, obtained from the full-size design clay model. The powertrain is a 5.0-litre Jaguar AJ-V8 engine generating with a six-speed ZF automatic transmission. It can accelerate from in 4.6 seconds with further performance upgrades available. At the Geneva International Motor Show in 2017, the Speedback GT was showcased in two specifications, one left-hand and one right-hand drive.
