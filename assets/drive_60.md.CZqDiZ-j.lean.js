Industries becoming the cause of water or air pollution are not encouraged. Every industrial project has to be passed by the clearance of the Environment Protection Organization before its establishment. Himachal is facing a number of difficulties in the advancement of industries. Lack of means of dependable transport and poor accessibility was one of the major drawbacks. Other problems faced by the state were the poor mineral resources, non-availability of infrastructure and communication facilities, shortage of capital and lack of modern skills. The only plus point of the state was the ample availability of electricity. In order to develop industrialization, a number of new policies were adopted by the state government like providing various incentives such as cheaper power, twenty five percent subsidy besides easier credit facilities through the State Finance Corporation and the nationalised banks for establishing new industries. Also, land was made available on 99 years low rate lease basis and new industries were exempted from sales or purchase tax. Concessions were also given on charges for transportation of raw materials from the nearest railhead outside the state beside provision of other marginal benefits. These concessions helped the state in establishing industrial houses. Gagret,Parwano, Barotiwala, Baddi, Paonta Sahib, Mehatpur, Shamshi, Nagrotu Bagwan, Bilaspur, Reckong Peo and Sansar Pur Tera are some of the industrial areas of the state at present.

History The journal was established in 1806 as the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions published by the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London. It was renamed to Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1907, following the merger that led to the formation of the Royal Society of Medicine and with volume numbering restarting at 1, before obtaining its current name in 1978.  Abstracting and indexing  The journal is abstracted and indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Science Citation Index, EMBASE, CAB International, and BIOBASE. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2014 impact factor of 2.118. Content The journal describes itself as having \\"an international and multi-specialty readership that includes primary care and public health professionals\\". It claims to act as \\"a forum for debate, education, and entertainment for clinicians interested in UK medicine and relevant international developments and research. The aim of the journal is to influence clinical practice and policy making across the whole range of medicine\\". Each issue contains original research articles, editorials, reviews, and essays.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City, en route to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On April 4, 1979, at or around 9:48 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (01:48 UTC), while flying over Saginaw, Michigan, the Boeing 727-31 airliner began a sharp, uncommanded roll to the right, and subsequently went into a spiral dive. The pilots were able to regain control of the aircraft and made a successful emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Incident  At 8:25 p.m. EST, TWA Flight 841 departed JFK International after a 45-minute delay due to traffic congestion. After traveling nearly , while cruising at near the city of Saginaw, Michigan, Captain Harvey \\"Hoot\\" Gibson says the aircraft was operating with the autopilot on \\"Altitude Hold\\" mode when it began a steep roll to the right. The crew immediately disconnected the autopilot and tried to bring the aircraft back to a wings level attitude. Despite the best efforts of the flight crew, the aircraft spiraled out of control, diving about in just 63 seconds. During the course of the dive, the plane rolled through 360 degrees twice and crossed the Mach limit for the 727 airframe. Control was regained at about after the pilots extended the landing gear in an attempt to slow the aircraft.Peterson, Iver. \\"Plane Passengers Prayed But Expected to Be Killed.\\" The New York Times (April 7, 1979), 6.The Post-Standard (Syracuse, New York), June 10, 1981, page 11 The plane suffered substantial structural damage, but made an emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Michigan at 10:31 p.m. EST without further trouble. No fatalities occurred among the 82 passengers and seven crew members. Eight passengers reported minor injuries related to high G forces. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident, conducting what was at the time the lengthiest accident investigation in NTSB history. In its final report, published in June 1981, the NTSB concluded the probable cause of the accident was pilot error. Among the damage discovered after the accident, investigators found the #7 slat missing from the leading edge of the right wing. NTSB investigators requested the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, inspect the remainder of the slat assembly, including a portion of the slat actuator cylinder (the motor that moves the slat and holds it in position). Boeing determined that the #7 slat had failed because the slats had been extended while the aircraft was flying at cruising speed. They also determined that it was \\"impossible\\" for the flaps to extend without manipulating the controls. After eliminating all individual and combined sources of mechanical failure, the NTSB ruled that the extension of the slats was due to the flight crew manipulating the flap/slat controls in an inappropriate manner.Witkin, Richard. \\"Safety Board Hints Crew Errors May Have Led to Jet Dive Over Michigan.\\" The New York Times (January 18, 1980), A10. Investigators believed that 727 pilots (in general, and this flight specifically) were setting the trailing edge flaps to two degrees during high altitude cruise, while at the same time pulling the circuit breaker for the slats so that they would not activate. This configuration was rumored to result in increased lift with no increase in drag, thus allowing more speed, higher elevation, or decreased fuel consumption. Flaps and Slats were intended to only be deployed at low speeds during take-off or landing. The crew, Capt. Harvey \\"Hoot\\" Gibson, first officer Scott Kennedy, and flight engineer Garry Banks, denied that their actions had been the cause of the flaps' extension: The crew suggested instead that an actuator on the #7 slat had failed, causing its inadvertent deployment. The NTSB rejected this as improbable and attributed the extension of the flaps to the deliberate actions of the crew. The crew claimed that such failures had happened on other 727s prior and subsequent to this incident.Boeing Operations Manual Bulletin, OMB 75-7, March 10, 1976; Subject: \\"Leading Edge Slat Actuator Lock Rings\\"; outlined specific conditions which had previously resulted in a Leading Edge Slat being pulled from the Retracted position (Mach > .8M, with failure of \\"A\\" System Hydraulic pressure to the slat actuator, with SpeedBrakes/Spoilers Extended). The NTSB report noted that between 1970 and 1973, seven separate cases involving a single leading edge slat extension and separation were reported, but none of these reports indicated whether or not the slat extension was due to flight crew involvement. Records after 1974 did include this information, and (other than Flight 174) only two slat extension problems were reported between 1974 and the close of the NTSB's investigation in 1981, one of which was inadvertently caused by the flight crew. The flight crew testified that they had not engaged the flaps, and the NTSB concluded that \\"if the flightcrew's recollections are accurate,\\" the slat extension must have been caused by a mechanical failure or defect. However, the NTSB ultimately concluded that the flight crew was probably attempting to use 2¬∫ of flaps at cruising speed: When retraction of the flaps was ordered, the Number 7 leading edge slat failed to retract, causing the uncommanded roll to the right. Captain Gibson appealed the NTSB's findings, first to the NTSB itself, and then to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both petitions were rejected: the former for lack of new evidence, and the latter for lack of jurisdiction due to the NTSB's \\"unreviewable discretion\\". The aircraft was repaired and returned to service in May 1979. Cockpit voice recorder The aircraft was equipped with a Fairchild Industries Model A-100 cockpit voice recorder (CVR). However, 21 minutes of the 30-minute tape were blank. Tests of the CVR in the aircraft revealed no discrepancies in the CVR's electrical and recording systems.The CVR tape can be erased by means of the bulk-erase feature on the CVR control panel located in the cockpit. This feature can be activated only after the aircraft is on the ground with its parking brake engaged. In a deposition taken by the Safety Board, the captain stated that he usually activates the bulk-erase feature on the CVR at the conclusion of each flight to preclude inappropriate use of recorded conversations. However, in this instance, he could not recall having done so. The NTSB made the following statement in the accident report: In media This incident was the subject of a 44-minute CBS News Special titled: The Plane That Fell From The Sky. The special won a Peabody Award in 1983. Criticism of investigation In the book Emergency: Crisis In the Cockpit, Stanley Stewart, a professional pilot, has raised questions about the NTSB findings: *Stewart suggests that the crew would not have been able to erase the CVR as the aircraft had to be completely shut down and on the ground. According to Stewart, the damage should have meant that the computers did not recognize the aircraft in a fully landed state (page 217). *He suggests that there were other incidents of 727-200s with uncommanded slat extensions in the years prior to and after the accident (page 224). *The flight crew knew the aircraft was potentially unstable at 39,000 ft. Stewart believes it would be unlikely they would \\"fool around\\" with the controls and risk the stability of the aircraft (page 221).

Career Ozma first came to prominence in early 2006 and is notorious for his performance at the 57th NHK K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, during which his female dancers stripped themselves of their outer clothing on stage to reveal unitards painted to resemble the nude female body while wearing a patch resembling a mushroom which covered the genitals. The station had to later clarify, in light of complaints, that the dancers were clothed, despite their appearance. For this performance, Ozma received a lifetime ban from performing at the NHK. During his three years of performing, DJ Ozma predominately covered other artists, usually K-Pop such as , a cover of the song Í∞Ä (Go) by the late Korean pop singer U;Nee, and \\"One Night\\", a cover of the Korean song of the same name by DJ Doc. Ozma most frequently covered songs from the K-Pop group Koyote, including \\"Junjou ~Sunjon~\\", Ozma's version of \\"Sunjeong.\\" Among Ozma's covers of songs originally by Japanese musicians, Ozma drew from hide's \\"Ever Free\\" and New RoTe'Ka's \\"DRINKIN' BOYS\\" which would be performed both live and in the music video with KING, Pancho, and other male dancers (but not Ozma himself) dancing in the nude, with red fans used to block their genitals. This music video has inspired numerous fan-made versions. Ozma would also cover his own songs from Kishidan with \\"Boys Bravo!\\", \\"Asa ga Kuru Tabi\\", \\"Koibito\\", and \\"One Night Carnival\\" serving as the B-Sides to the first four of Ozma's singles. Kishidan's \\"Sayonara December\\" („Åï„Çà„Å™„ÇâDecember) was also covered in a completely different style for an album release. However, Kishidan could be said to have covered DJ Ozma when they performed the Ramones' Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio? live,http://natalie.mu/music/news/114928 a song that Ozma had originally covered as a bonus track for his final album. Ozma did record original songs, mostly coming on the later albums. In late 2008, Ozma collaborated with Ravex on the song \\"I Rave U\\" as part of the 20th anniversary of the Avex Group Record Label, having just switched from Universal Music Japan to join Avex in September of that year. Several of Ozma's original songs became movie theme songs: \\"Lie-Lie-Lie\\" was used for Naruto Shippuden the Movie, \\"Ninkimono de Ikou!\\" for Crayon Shin-chan: The Storm Called: The Hero of Kinpoko, and \\"Masurao\\" for Mr. Tadano's Secret Mission: From Japan with Love. DJ Ozma is better known in Japan for his performances as in the rock band Kishidan, which utilized a retro B≈çs≈çzoku image, and bizarre theatrics at concerts. Kishidan was first formed in 1997, but went on hiatus during the DJ Ozma years. The group came to prominence in the 2000s after releasing the now iconic song \\"One Night Carnival\\". Prior to Ozma's controversial NHK K≈çhaku Uta Gassen performance, Kishidan was invited to perform \\"One Night Carnival\\" during two consecutive years. Ozma's other alter-ego was playing 16-year-old girl in Yazima Beauty Salon. As Ayanocozey, he joined the promotional super-group FANTA, releasing the single \\"Fantastic Love\\". The DJ OZMA \\"Family\\" When performing as DJ Ozma, he was backed up by Yaoh \\"KING\\" Junichi (Binetsu Danji's Teruya Hoshikuzu) who served as the second vocalist, and Pancho (Kishidan's Hikaru Saotome) who performed rap sections. The Ozma family also had a series of back up dancers: The OZ-MAX, female vocalists and dancers, occasionally having solo songs: Ayami (Nakazato Ayami, a future member of SDN48), Miki, Mariko, Yukko, and Chiharu. The OZ-MAX originally numbered four, before Yukko was added making five, all of whom were formerly Kishidan backdancers. The OZ-MAX frequently had solo verses in songs, especially Ozma covers of Koyote songs which required female voices. The covers of \\"Boys Bravo!\\", \\"Koibito\\", and \\"PRISM\\" were all performed exclusively by the OZ-MAX, although \\"Boys Bravo!\\" was a solo for Ayami. Ayami, Mariko, and Yukko have continued to perform as Kishidan backdancers, but Miki and Chiharu had departed by the time DJ Ozma had \\"resurrected\\" in 2011. The OZ-MATE, six male backup dancers: Mine, Mamoru, TSURU-G, Hiroki, Kochi, and Choleste (aka Cholesterol-kun). The OZ-MANIACS, various other personalities: MC Korea (Nishikiori Junpei of Binetsu Danji), MC Maji, So What? Brothers (who replaced MC Maji after the Maji character left the group following the LUV-XURY tour), Takuya Noro, ODAWARA JOE (who was also Maki Seigo for the second generation DJ Ozma prank), etc. Retirement and Resurrection While on tour for his third album in 2008, he announced that he would be retiring from performing as DJ Ozma. While the retirement of DJ Ozma was true, Ozma set up an elaborate hoax during his announcement press conference. He introduced Maki Seigo, a supposed part-time video store worker and friend from Ozma's past, and stated that Maki would continue on as a second generation of DJ Ozma in a \\"pure, correct and beautiful\\" way.http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/dj-ozma- to-retire-at-end-of-year-become-producer Maki would be joined by Mine of the OZ-MATE, who would step into the part of Yaoh \\"Prince\\" Junichi, thereby replacing Yaoh \\"KING\\" Junichi as second vocalist. Pancho would remain on board as Pancho. One month later, at the farewell concert \\"Ozma Forever Forever Ozma\\" (OFFO), Maki was given a video introduction, and he awkwardly walked onstage in street clothes, addressing the audience briefly before being forced offstage as dancers began performing the song \\"Spiderman\\". Thus, the entire Maki announcement and subsequent plan for a second generation of DJ Ozma was revealed to be a prank. Following the OFFO concert of December 13, 2008, the DJ Ozma persona \\"retired\\" on December 13, 2008, but he continued to perform as part of Yazima Beauty Salon, listed as its producer and its main lyricist, and reunited with Kishidan. DJ Ozma was revived in December 2011 with the release of a new single, Chinkonka. This coincided with the Kishidan release of My Way a single cover to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Kishidan. In addition to competing for sales, a joint concert was held in late December, Kishidan vs DJ OZMA, to parody both the supposed rivalry of Ozma and Ayanocozey, and Ozma's denial that his two alter egos are the same people. Ayanocozey performed both his Kishidan and DJ Ozma alter egos (as did KING, Pancho, and the backdancers). However, in a callback to the OFFO concert, during sections where both Ayanocozey and Ozma appeared onstage and singing together, Ozma was played by Maki Seigo, who at one point, proclaimed again that he would step into a 2nd generation of DJ Ozma. Maki then immediately announced his retirement and, as was the case during OFFO, followed again by \\"Spiderman\\".http://www.kishidan.com/extra/110426_02/archive.html On November 17 of 2013, Ozma (announcing it as Ayanocozey) admitted that the Ayanocozey and Ozma were \\"the same character\\".http://news.aol.jp/2013/11/17/dj-ozma/  Discography = Albums  * I ‚ô° Party People (2006-11-15) * I ‚ô° Party People 2 (2007-12-5) * I ‚ô° Party People 3 (2008-12-31) * Single Collection 2006-2008 A-Side Trax (2008-12-31)  Singles   \\"One Night\\" (2006-09-27) * * \\"E.Yo.Ne!!\\" (2007-06-13) * \\"Lie-Lie-Lie\\" (2007-08-01) * \\"Spiderman\\" (2007-09-19) * \\"Tokyo Boogie Back\\" (2007-11-14) * * \\"Masurao\\" (2008-12-03) * References External links  * Category:Avex Group artists Category:Japanese DJs Category:Japanese male pop singers Category:Japanese dance musicians Category:Living people Category:Singers from Tokyo Category:Comedians from Tokyo Category:1979 births Category:Electronic dance music DJs Category:Japanese comedy musicians Category:Cover artists Category:21st-century Japanese singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"DJ Ozma"},{"id":"10049472","text":"Cung≈°an (, ) was a chieftain of the Jurchen Jianzhou Left Guard.

The garden is a Persian garden, where pathways and canals divide the garden to represent the Islamic ideal of paradise, an abundant garden through which rivers flow. The Aram Bagh provides an example of a variant of the charbagh in which water cascades down three terraces in a sequence of cascades. Two viewing pavilions face the Jumna river and incorporates a subterranean 'tahkhana' which was used during the hot summers to provide relief for visitors.

Geography=Geographical location=Municipality Herbertingen forms the municipality with Hundersingen, Marbach and Mieterkingen. HistoryLandscape and region The community Herbertingen with its rolling hills and wide valleys is located on the northern edge of Upper Swabia. The landscape is formed by the ice masses and the meltwater of the Rhine glacier, which has been advancing from the Alps to Upper Swabia for more than 2 million years during several ice ages. The valleys of the Danube, Schwarzach and Kr√§henbach were carved into the molasse layers, colorful marls and glimmering fine sands, which form the core of the long hills between the valleys and their subsoil. The glacier of the penultimate, the crack ice age (200,000 to 130,000 years before today) crossed the territory of the community with repeated advances and left deep valleys and small lakes between steep hills with fat ground moraine on hills and slopes for agriculture and gravel for the gravel pits. The glacier of the last, the W√ºrm Ice Age (115,000 to 11,500 years before today) did not reach the municipality, but remained stuck south of Bad Saulgau. His melt waters filled the Schwarzachtal with gravel. The glacial landscape in front of the glacier's forehead was a deep frozen, almost treeless Arctic cold desert. In the Arctic summer, the earth thawed superficially, flowed as mud to the base of a slope or was flooded by the rain, the steep slopes flattened: The old landscape took on the sanded soft shapes that we know today. 11,500 years old is the warm period in which we live. More than 10,000 years ago, deciduous forest began to cover the land, bogs grew in depressions and wet valleys, where the streams and rivers flowed in loops. Over 6,000 years ago, man began managing nature. The Danube was not so easy to control; she has cut open until the regulation with dikes, the left half of the valley with flood waters with new loops. For buses (767 m above sea level), it is only a stone's throw away. The \\"holy mountain of Upper Swabia\\", a landmark that can be seen from afar, opens the view to the nearby Federsee and its moor girdle and, with good visibility, over the entire Alpine arc. The Swabian Alb with deep, meandering streams with clear water, framed by white limestone cliffs on steep valley walls, with plateaus and dry valleys, juniper heaths and stalactite caves, is close and well developed by a dense network of cycling and hiking trails. The Upper Danube also attracts with its romantic, deeply cut breakthrough valley. For Lake Constance, with its mild climate and very own vegetation, it is just 50 km, where you cross the steeply hilly Jungmor√§nen landscape with old half- timbered towns and entrancing baroque monasteries and churches.

In the 1380s the tribe migrated southward towards the lower valley of the Tumen River and settled in Womuho (present day Hoeryong). Career In 1388, the Hongwu Emperor established contact with three tribes of the Jianzhou Jurchens, the Odoli, Huligai and Tuowen and attempted to enlist them as allies against the Mongols. There was a general migration south of the various Jurchen groups around the start of the 15th century and the three tribes established themselves around the Tumen River (near the modern border of China, Russia and North Korea). Not long afterwards, the various Jurchens began accepting Ming titles from the Yongle Emperor as the Military Commanders of the three Wei, namely Jianzhou Wei (), Jianzhou Left Wei () and Jianzhou Right Wei (). The Wei () was military unit composed of 5 Suo (), and each Suo was staffed with 1100 soldiers. As Military Commanders of Wei, they were required to go to Beijing every year to pay tribute to the Emperor. In 1395, he visited the Joseon court to present tribute to the Taejo of Joseon. As a result, in 1404, he was awarded an honorary military position by the Koreans. During this time, the Ming court frequently sent envoys to local chieftains to persuade local chieftains to recognize the suzerainty of the Ming emperor, however M√∂ngke Tem√ºr did not respond. This was to the delight of the Korean court and in 1405, he was nominated to be a myriarch under the Korean king. In April 1405, a Ming envoy of Jurchen origin Wang Jiaohuati, was sent to Korea to persuade the Korean king along with M√∂ngke Tem√ºr to enter into tributary relations with the Ming. Ahacu (), later also known as Li Sicheng (), chief of the Huligai, became commander of the Jianzhou Wei (Âª∫Â∑ûË°õ) in 1403, named after a Yuan Dynasty political unit in the area. M√∂ngke Tem√ºr of the Odoli became leader of the Jianzhou Left Wei () and accepted the Chinese surname of T√≥ng () not long afterward. The Koreans tried to persuade M√∂ngke Tem√ºr to reject the Ming dynasty's overtures, but was unsuccessful since M√∂ngke Tem√ºr submitted to the Ming. The Korean king ordered M√∂ngke Tem√ºr not to comply with the request of Ming, he first complied with this order only to capitulate, visiting Nanjing in September 1405, leaving with an appointment as regional commissioner. In the following years, the Jurchen tribes along with M√∂ngke Tem√ºr's Odoli tribe fought skirmishes and battles with the Koreans. With the constant insecurity in the presence of the Koreans, Meng and his followers migrated westward, settling in May 1411 in Fengzhou, in the valley of the Hoifa river, an affluent of the Sunggari river, where the Jianzhou guard under ≈†igiyanu (Li Xianzhong) was located. Here the Ming government would establish the Jianzhou Left Guard from the existing Jianzhou guard with M√∂ngke Tem√ºr as the regional commander of the new guard. During this time, the Yongle Emperor began frequently sending expeditionary forces towards the Mongols, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr and his followers would take part in one such expedition in 1422. With the threat of retaliatory invasions of the Mongols and the growing dominance of Li Manzhu, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr and his followers, who numbered more than six thousand were forced to leave Fengzhou and head back to Womuho in 1423. After his return, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr decided that the best policy of self-preservation would be to serve both Ming and Korean interests. In 1426, he visited Beijing and awarded a promotion as assistant commissioner in chief. His half brother Fanca visited Beijing in 1432, presented tribute, and was promoted to assistant commissioner. In 1432, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr visited Beijing again and was promoted to commissioner in chief while Fanca was made a regional commissioner. Starting in 1427, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr had begun sending his eldest son Agu to visit the Korean court with the hopes that Agu would become a royal bodyguard in Korea. On November 30, 1433, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr and his son Agu were killed in a riot led by Yang Mutawuta, a Jurchen battalion commander from a different tribe in the area of Kaiyuan. Yang Mutawuta had followed Mongke Temur and his son. After the Qing Dynasty was established, M√∂ngke Tem√ºr was given the posthumous name Zh√†oz«î ().

He was born in Irkutsk, Russia, and currently lives in Moscow. Music career Shulgin's career began at the age of 19 in Russian rock band Kruiz. The band is regarded as legendary for being the first rock band from the USSR to tour abroad (1983‚Äì1986). The popularity of The Kruiz was remarkable as they were known as anti-Soviet, and there was no mention of the band in mass media. With the advent of reorganization of the USSR, in 1985, The Kruiz sold 20 million copies of their first album and in 1987 the album was released by WEA (Germany). After The Kruiz, Shulgin began working in Germany, where he created \\"The Taiga Symphony\\". This was a combination of Russian classic music with western rock-music with music by Vitally Bondarchuck and lyrics by American composer Richard Niles. The album featured The Moscow Symphony Orchestra conducted by Pavel Kogan and respected Western musicians Alvin Lee, Paul Carrack, Mel Collins, Phil Palmer and J.J. Belle. Successful in the USSR, it was the beginning of the career of Valeria who has become one of the most popular singers in Russia. Shulgin then created \\"Merry Christmas to the World\\", an East-West collaboration between Shulgin and BBC Worldwide. With music by Shulgin and lyrics and production by Richard Niles, it expressed the ethos of glasnost. London studio musicians performed with members of the Moscow Symphony and the Soviet Folk Orchestra. Sung by Valeria, the video was directed by Ken Russell who used it in his film \\"Alice in Russialand\\" (1998). Shot in Red Square, the clip featured psychic Uri Geller. During a special communication, astronauts from the \\"Star Township\\" introduced Valeria while in orbit around the Earth.

Afterwards Shulgin recorded a solo album for ‚ÄúFM GROUP‚Äù lead-singer Alevtina Egorova, and also worked with Tatiana Ovsienko, Nastya Shirokova. In spring of 2005, Shulgin got the suggestion to write music for the new music serial with the tentative title ‚ÄúPrimadonna‚Äù, the serial made for showing on the Russian TV Channel. For this ‚ÄúPrimadonna‚Äù serial Alexander wrote 20 original songs, and at the very least three leading themes from the film and all the songs of a composer got into the final variant of ‚ÄúPrimadonna‚Äù. Shulgin also wrote all the music filling-out for the new socio- political TV Channel ‚ÄúSPAS‚Äù (The Festival of the Saviour). Shulgin released his first solo album ‚ÄúPredstavlenie‚Äù (The Introduction), and Shulgin signed with TheOrchard.com. The album was released worldwide. Shulgin wrote material for two albums by Elena Sheremet, Lady-Sax and Lady-sax (The Remixes). Successful Russian artists who have recorded Shulgin's songs include Valeriya, Alexander Buinov, The Band FM, Yulia Mikhalchik, Drugie Pravila and Tatyana Ovsienko.

He originated the first English revival of historical fencing, together with his colleagues Egerton Castle, Captain Carl Thimm, Colonel Cyril Matthey, Captain Percy Rolt, Captain Ernest George Stenson Cooke, Captain Frank Herbert Whittow, Sir Frederick and Walter Herries Pollock.Thimm, Carl Albert. A Complete Bibliography of Fencing and Duelling, London, 1896 Preface  Early life  Alfred Hutton was born on 10 March 1839 at Beverley, Yorkshire the eleventh and youngest child and seventh son of Henry William Hutton (1787‚Äì1848) and his wife Marianne (before 1795-1879), only child of John Fleming of Beverley.In Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Henry W Hutton was a captain in the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, retired 1811. Alfred attended Blackheath Proprietary School (Lewisham), matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 25 November 1857. He was intended for the Church, but the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in 1857 turned his thoughts toward a military career, and he left the university without graduating and joined the Army.Famous Swordsman. An article in Evening Post (New Zealand), Volume LXXXI, Issue 41, 18 February 1911 p. 14  Military career  In stable dress, wearing a forage cap His military career began on 31 May 1859, when he joined the 79th (Cameron) Highlanders as an Ensign. On arrival at the depot of his regiment at Perth he soon proved himself an expert fencer. Upon joining the headquarters of his regiment in India, at the request of his commanding officer, Colonel Hodgson, he organized in the regiment the Cameron Fencing Club, for which he prepared his first work, a 12-page booklet entitled Swordsmanship (1862),Sources in the V&A; Museum's library printed at Simla Advertiser Press. On 14 January 1862 Hutton was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. In 1864 after 4 years in the infantry he exchanged into the cavalry: the 7th Hussars. After being invalided home in 1865 he joined the 1st King's Dragoon Guards in 1866, and continued to popularize fencing in his regiments. He was gazetted captain on 30 September 1868, and retired from the service in 1873.  Fencing  Portrait of Alfred Hutton (late 1890s) Hutton started to learn fencing at the age of twelve at the fencing school in St James' Street from Henry Charles Angelo the Younger (1780-1852), appointed Superintendent of Sword Exercise in the Army (1833-1852), author of Infantry Sword Exercise (1845), which remained the standard Army reference book for sword instruction on foot for 50 years. This school was established by Domenico Angelo Malevolti Tremamondo (1716-1802), renowned Italian fencing master from Leghorn, author of the classic treatise on small sword L‚Äô√âcole des armes (1763, The School of Fencing). Alfred's father was a pupil of Henry Angelo the elder (1756-1835), son of the founder of this fencing dynasty, Domenico Angelo.Angelo, Henry. Infantry Sword Exercise,1845 After returning from India in 1865, Hutton had become the pupil and friend of William McTurk, Henry Charles Angelo's successor at the school of arms in St James' Street. On leaving the army he focused on practicing modern fencing with foil, sabre, and bayonet, but mainly on the study and revival of older fencing systems and schools. In 1889 Hutton published his most influential work, Cold Steel: A Practical Treatise on the Sabre, which presented an original method of military sabre use on foot, combining the 18th century English backsword with modern Italian duelling sabre. The treatise also offered self-defense techniques based on constable's truncheon and short sword-bayonet, as well as exercise material from 16th century texts, including Marozzo. He successfully advocated the use by cavalry of a straight pointed sword for thrusting rather than an edged sword for cutting. In 1890 he published Fixed Bayonets, in which he insisted that a competently wielded bayonet should beat a good swordsman, but his views of bayonet fighting were regarded in the army as too theoretical for modern practical instruction. He retorted by deploring military reliance on Italian theories of swordsmanship to the exclusion of effective French practice. Hutton's pioneering advocacy and practice of historical fencing included reconstructions of the fencing systems of several historical masters including George Silver and Achille Marozzo. He delivered numerous lectures on, and practical demonstrations of these systems during the 1890s, both in order to benefit various military charities and to encourage patronage of the contemporary methods of competitive fencing, which had hitherto fallen out of popular fashion in England. He also used these lectures and demonstrations to advocate his own theories about military sabre fencing.  Influence upon stage fencing  Actress and stage fencer Esm√© Beringer, a student of Hutton's. Hutton successfully introduced realistic, historically accurate swordplay into the contemporary theatrical repertoire. In Old Sword Play (1892) he wrote: Circa 1899‚Äì1902, Hutton taught stage fencing classes for actors via the Bartitsu Club, where he also served on the Board of Directors and learned the basics of jujutsu and the Vigny method of stick fighting from his fellow instructors. Alfred Hutton arranged combats for numerous London plays, including: * Romeo and Juliet at the Court Theatre, performed 17 March 1904 ‚Äì 5 March 1904 * The Comedy of Errors, performed 17 December 1904 (4 performances) * Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum, performed 14 March 1908 ‚Äì 30 May 1908  Death  St Mary's Church from the south He died unmarried at his chambers in 76 Jermyn Street, London, on 18 December 1910, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church in Astbury, near Congleton, Cheshire, three days later.

Dettenhausen is a village in the administrative district (Kreis) of T√ºbingen, in the Sch√∂nbuch Nature Park. It is located 11 km north of T√ºbingen, and about 25 km south of Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Dettenhausen was first officially mentioned in the Codex Hirsaugiensis in around 1100 AD as \\"Detenhusen\\". Dettenhausen has 5.441 citizens (as of December 31, 2013). Dettenhausen's coat of arms is a red deer against a yellow background with a yellow ear of grains against a red background. The Sch√∂nbuchbahn railway links Dettenhausen with B√∂blingen, where it connects with lines S1 and S60 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn. Geography The large, natural forests of the Sch√∂nbuch are located in the midst of the densely populated, highly industrialized Neckar region. This is a leisure destination for local residents, home to many species of plants and animals and an essential source of fresh air for the region whilst at the same time producing wood, a natural and sustainable raw material. At the end of the 1960s, there were plans to build a new airport for Stuttgart here, but these were thwarted by the resistance of a large part of the population and a number of official bodies. As a result, it was decided to establish a nature park in the extensive forests between B√∂blingen, Sindelfingen, Herrenberg and T√ºbingen in 1972. Sch√∂nbuch Nature Park is an almost completely wooded part of the Swabian terraced landscape between the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura. The giant steps of the Sch√∂nbuch are formed by alternating strata of sandstone and clay which have eroded at different speeds. The hard Keuper mountains rise up from the agricultural land of the G√§u plain to the west, forming the characteristic southern edge of the Sch√∂nbuch with their hard sandstones. Neighboring communities The following cities and municipalities border the municipality Dettenhausen; they are in a clockwise direction starting called the north and part of the district of B√∂blingen or to the counties Reutlingen and T√ºbingen: Waldenbuch, Walddorfh√§slach, Pliezhausen, T√ºbingen and Weil im Sch√∂nbuch. Municipality arrangement The municipality Dettenhausen include the village Dettenhausen and detached Hirschland. History The first documented mention of the church as Dete Husen was around the year 1100. However, it is assumed that about 700 people had already settled at the site. Politics Town hall Dettenhausen The local council elections on 25 May 2014 resulted in the following distribution of seats: *FWV: 9 seats *CDU: 3 seats *SPD: 2 seats Local attractions Sch√∂nbuchmuseum Dettenhausen Jagd, Stein und Wald (district of T√ºbingen) Germany Dettenhausen offers hiking, swimming, and the Sch√∂nbuchmuseum, the local museum. Dettenhausen has a city program with two cities, one in the former East of Germany, Treuen and one in Hungary, Tab. The Sch√∂nbuch Museum shows in the areas of hunting, stone and wood much about life in the area. In the Polizeimuseum a historic international collection of police uniforms from Bernhard Strobel can be seen. A memorial for Gottlieb Aberle is at the cemetery in Dettingen and in Riedlingen. Gottlieb Aberle was on April 21, 1945 for allegedly \\"aiding the enemy\\" with two other prisoners by shot in the neck by a command of the Gestapo in the forest near Riedlingen murdered. His offense: He had found two downed Canadian aviator pilots in Sch√∂nbuch and taken with him. Transport The country road 1208 leads north to the south of Stuttgart and T√ºbingen. The Sch√∂nbuchbahn W√ºrttembergische railway company connects the town with B√∂blingen and therefore with the S-Bahn to Stuttgart. In 2011 the Sch√∂nbuchbahn celebrated its centenary. In 2010 the Sch√∂nbuch Museum had two special railway-themed exhibitions. Public transport is ensured by the Verkehrsverbund Neckar-Alb- Donau (NALDO). The community is located in the comb 109. District heating In Dettenhausen there has been a wood heating plant since 2009. The cogeneration plant will supply the place gradually with district heating. In 2011 a civil association was established for this purpose. The heating network in the area of the railway station to Dettenhausen will be expanded.tagblatt.de vom 16. Juli 2011tagblatt.de vom 21.

The village was named for the first time in the records as 'villa Tuzzilinga' in the year 888. By 1135 it was called Tuzzelingen, in 1216 it was called Tusselingen. The name itself comes from the personal name Tuzzilo, and the -ingen is an old Alemannic suffix. That Du√ülingen goes \\"way back\\" is proven by artifacts that have been found from the stone age, the Hallstatt age, Latene period, and Roman era. Like other villages in medieval times, the income from the church and from the farms was distributed to a series of nobles, typically as rewards or in payment for fealty and service. It is often difficult for us to understand these times because things were so different from today in terms of property ownership, political and church organization, and so on. Du√ülingen municipality The Knights of Du√ülingen were subjects of the Count of T√ºbingen, and seem to have flourished in the period from 1250 to 1400. They took on the family name of Herter (surnames just coming into vogue during that time), and passed the village property on from generation to generation. The Herters also performed the duties of pastor to the village. Apparently falling on hard time, Jacob Herter with his nephew Hans sold the village to Count Ludwig of W√ºrttemberg in 1446. However, Jacob's son Wilhelm ended up getting the property back as a fief because of his stature in the W√ºrttemberg court. When he died in 1477 in Basel, Switzerland, he was lauded as \\"brave Knight Wilhelm Herter of T√ºbingen, large of body, large of knowledge and wisdom and eloquence, mourned by all, by lordship and noblemen and common folk.\\" The Herter family retained its fief until the death of their last male heir in 1614. (This is just prior to the time when the Du√ülingen church records start.) There used to be a castle in Du√ülingen. A part of the wall which surrounded the old castle on the north edge of the village still remains today. It is incorporated into the foundation of the large old timber frame house that was formerly the mayor's house and town hall. Part of the castle moat is still visible today. Still remaining are enormous square foundation stones from the 13th century. A slight bend in the wall seems to point to a polygonal shape, similar to the old Castle of Kilchberg.

The European Watershed, the divide between the Rhine and Danube watersheds, occurs in the town's territory. The source of the Prim, which joins the Neckar (a tributary of the Rhine) in Rottweil, is located only a kilometer away from the source of the Faulenbach, an eventual tributary of the Danube, in neighboring D√ºrbheim. Balgheim is bordered by B√∂ttingen to the north, D√ºrbheim to the southeast, Rietheim-Weilheim to the south, and the city Spaichingen to the west. History Tombs dating from the Merovingian dynasty indicate that Balgheim was founded in the 6th or 7th century. It was first mentioned in writing in 1113. In 1420 it was sold to the Free Imperial City Rottweil, where it remained until 1689, after which its rule changed often until it became part of W√ºrttemberg in 1806. Politics Balgheim belongs to the Amt Spaichingen. Transportation The Bundesstra√üe 14 (federal highway) between Rottweil and Tuttlingen passes by the east edge of Balgheim.

History The first written mention of B√∂ttingen was in 802 and contained a land title grant by the Abbey of Saint Gall. Celtic and Alemanni grave finds as well as flint axes in a cave indicate an earlier Stone Age settlement. After 1253 the territory paid tribute and received protection from the Beuron Archabbey, after a change of ownership the Bishopric of Constance, and then the Herren von Enzberg, until it became part of W√ºrttemberg in 1805. The village had to pay interest and tithe as well as socage until 1848.

Caucasotachea vindobonensis photographed in M√∂dling, near Vienna The scientific name is derived from the Celtic settlement Vindobona, now known as Vienna, the capital of Austria. This species was assigned to the genus Cepaea for a long time. However, molecular biologist research showed, that it is not closely related to Cepaea, but belongs in fact to the genus Caucasotachea. Description The right-coiled, globular shell of C. vindobonensis is about 17‚Äì21 mm high and 20‚Äì25 mm broad with 5,5-6 whorls. The umbilicus is completely covered in adult specimens. The lip is always red-brown at the inner and outer side with a fine white stripe at its margin. This specific lip coloration allows to separate it from the conchological similar Cepaea hortensis (pure white lip) and Cepaea nemoralis (consistent dark brown lip), with which C. vindobonensis often co-occurs. The shell is whitish or yellowish, with about 5 brown stripes, the upper two are usually weak. The lowermost stripe is quite near to the covered umbilicus. There is a slight variation of shell coulour within this species (see below). The animal itself is yellowish with grey tentacles. Examples of shell variation within C. vindobonensis: File:Cepaea_vindobonensis_01.JPG File:Cepaea_vindobonensis_02.JPG File:Cepaea_vindobonensis_03.JPG Distribution and habitat Distribution of C. vindobonensis in Europe (modified after Welter-Schultes)The distribution of this species is Pontic, Pannonian and Balkanian. It occurs in Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic (near threatened (NT) Its westernmost, but non-indigenous, record is from Western Bohemia.), Germany (reintroduced), Greece), Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Russia (Rostov Oblast, Stavropol Krai, Krasnodar Krai, Moscow Region - non-indigenous distributionEgorov R.

PDF.) and Ukraine The original habitat of C. vindobonensis was most probably open forests on the Balkans, from where it spread over large parts of Central and Eastern Europe after the last glaciation. Nevertheless, it also dwells in several grassland habitats like meadows, steppe and ruderal areas, especially in the north of its distribution area. The highest vertical occurrence is about 1600 m asl in Southern Bulgaria. Life cycle All the following information originates from a Greek study. Because Greece is in the southernmost part of the distribution area, the phenology for this species might be quite difference in the more northerly countries where it is found. According to the Greek study, C. vindobonensis becomes mature after its second year, and can reach a maximum life span of about 7 years. The reproductive period in Greece lasts from April to June, with a maximum in May. About 29-67 eggs are laid, having a diameter about 3 mm, and the juveniles hatch out after 18 days. During hot summer days, these snails rest attached to leaves or the stems of tall plants. Hibernation commences at the end of October to the beginning of November, and the snails come out of hibernation in March.

Geography Gosheim lies at the foot of the Lemberg, the highest mountain of Swabian Alps. This mountain, at , is the highest peak of the range. It is part of the Heuberg plateau. The town boundary lies on the escarpment. Neighboring communities The town is bordered on the north by Deilingen, on the east by Wehingen, on the southeast by Bubsheim and B√∂ttingen, on the south by Denkingen, and on the west by Frittlingen and Wellendingen in the Rottweil district. Community structure The town includes the village of Gosheim and the farmstead of Aum√ºhle. History Traces of settlement from the Hallstatt period have been found. Gosheim first appears in 1295 as Gossheim in a charter of Count Albrecht II of Hohenberg. The village was a dependency (Vogtei) of the castle of Wehingen and from 1351 part of Austria. In 1805 the village was transferred to W√ºrttemberg. From 1806 to 1938 Gosheim belonged to the oberamt of Spaichingen, and since 1938 to the Tuttlingen district. During the Second World War British aircraft dropped heavy bombs within Gosheim's borders on 22 February 1945 at 1400 hours. The bombs fell on Wiesental, Jamit, T√§li and on the Sturmb√ºhl. The bombs were intended to destroy the Heuberg Railroad, the former railway line. None hit their intended target, but the harvest was destroyed for several years. The bomb craters were deep and have a diameter of . Each bomb ejected and scattered of rock. Even today there are still traces visible. It is believed that three unexploded bombs still remain buried in Wiesental. After the Second World War numerous ethnic German refugees from Yugoslavia settled to the benefit of what was then small industry, which soon expanded rapidly. From around 1970, the increasing demand for labor was met by newly arrived foreign residents, in the beginning mainly from Italy. Towards the end of the twentieth century most industrial enterprises moved from the center to the outskirts of Gosheim. The necessary land was opened up between the former railway line and the Egartensiedlung and on the Sturmb√ºhl. Culture and points of interest Gosheim is affiliated with the tourist association \\"Donaubergland\\". Buildings The radar tower on the Hochwald A meter-high radar facility of the German Air Traffic Control (Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH) is located at an altitude of above sea level in the forest district of Nack. The system was built in 1973-74, and in 1975 was placed in operation by the Bundesanstalt f√ºr Flugsicherung. The original red and white ring of parabolic antennas was slightly higher than the observation deck of the Lemberg. Since 1 January 1994, the facility has been owned by Deutsche Flugsicherung. In September 1998, it was replaced by a newer and smaller installation. This system monitors airspace in a radius of . The radar data are automatically transferred to the air traffic controllers in Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Zurich, Frankfurt, Munich, and Friedrichshafen. Recreation and sports Gosheim has a well-developed network of walking and hiking trails, cross-country ski trails, and a ski slope in winter. The largest recreational facility is the Jurabad, an indoor swimming pool with adjoining sauna and gym. A three court indoor tennis facility of the Heuberg Tennis Club was built in 1988. The Gosheim sports club currently plays in the district league (2013-2014). There are also, among other things, a music club and a choral society. Gosheim is also home to a biathlon center. The biathlon track circles the radar tower at an average altitude of about . The Gosheim Ski Club (SC Gosheim) has produced many talents, such as Simone Hauswald and Kathrin Lang. Economy and infrastructure Headquarters of Hermle AG Gosheim is characterized by numerous small and medium-sized industrial enterprises (mainly metal processing industry, machined parts, and watches) with some 2,500 employees. With a population of approximately 3800, this means that many workers commute daily to Gosheim. The publicly traded company Hermle AG is based in Gosheim.

In 1953, he was commissioned by the state government of Western Australia to produce a plan for the metropolitan area of Perth and Fremantle. The resulting 1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region was co-authored with Alistair Hepburn, and is commonly known as the \\"Stephenson- Hepburn Report\\". It included an atlas of maps which laid down a broad pattern of future land uses including highways and open space, and catered for significant additional population growth. The report formed the basis for the 1963 Metropolitan Region Scheme for Perth and Fremantle, a legal instrument for regulating land-use and development in the urban areahttp://www.wapc.wa.gov.au/Coast/Perth+coastal+planning+strategy/BP4%20Urban%20Development.pdf?id=1109. It remained the overarching strategic plan for the development of Perth until it was succeeded by the Corridor Plan for Perth in 1970.  Later career  In 1953 he returned to the UK to take up the Chair of Civic Design at the University of Liverpool and, following his work in Perth, he was employed variously as a consultant planner and academic in New Zealand, Canada, and America. In Halifax, Canada, he is known for his 1957 plan to redevelop the entire downtown core as well as the forceful eviction of Africville, a historically black neighborhood. He subsequently returned to Perth and continued to play an important role in its development, amongst other things crafting plans for Joondalup and Midland regional centres, and for the campus of Murdoch University.Gordon Stephenson In later life, he authored several books.

Personal life and collaboration with Flora Crockett  In 1938, Stephenson married New Jersey-born Flora Bartlett Crockett (1914-1979). She had been one of the first two women to graduate in City Planning from MIT, in 1937. The two collaborated on published work and research thereafter. Gerald Dix writes of Crockett: \\"She was an immense support and a sound professional collaborator upon whose judgement her relied in much of his work for 40 years.

Cophasing implies precise, active control of three degrees of freedom of each individual segment mirror: translation along the optical axis (piston) and rotation about two axes perpendicular to the optical axis (tip-tilt). Each segment of the segmented telescope is a solid body having 6 degrees of freedom exposed to the gravitation force, wind blowing, and other mechanical forces. If the position of each segment is not controlled the resolution of the whole telescope will be the same as if telescope had the diameter equal to the size of one segment. To achieve a resolution commensurable with that of a monolithic telescope of the same diameter the segmented surface must be controlled with a precision better than \\\\lambda/40 surface rms. Projects for future extremely large telescopes (ELTs) generally depend on the use of a segmented primary mirror. While the basic technologies required for segmented telescopes have been demonstrated for the 10m Keck telescope or GTC telescope, ELTs of diameters form 50 to 100 m represent a qualitative change with respect to wave front control related to segmentation in comparison with the current 10 meters technology.

GARUDA is a collaboration of science researchers and experimenters on a nationwide grid of computational nodes, mass storage and scientific instruments that aims to provide the technological advances required to enable data and compute intensive science for the 21st century. One of GARUDA's most important challenges is to strike the right balance between research and the daunting task of deploying that innovation into some of the most complex scientific and engineering endeavors being undertaken today. The Department of Information Technology (DIT), Government of India has funded the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) to deploy the nationwide computational grid GARUDA. In Proof of Concept (PoC) phase which ended on March 2008, 17 cities across the country were connected with an aim to bring ‚ÄúGrid‚Äù networked computing to research labs and industry. From April 2008 the Foundation phase is in progress with an aim to include more users‚Äô applications, providing Service Oriented architecture, improving network stability and upgrading grid resources. GARUDA will assist to accelerate India's drive to turn its substantial research investment into tangible economic benefits. The Main Monitoring Centre also called the Garuda Monitoring and Management Centre is set up at C-DAC Knowledge Park, Bangalore. From this point, the whole grid which has now extended even into Europe is Monitored and Managed by C-DAC's young scientists. In India, GARUDA uses National Knowledge Network as network backbone. Grid Middleware GARUDA has adopted a pragmatic approach for using existing Grid infrastructure and Web Services technologies. The deployment of grid tools and services for GARUDA will be based on a judicious mix of in-house developed components, the Globus Toolkit (GT), industry grade & open source components. The Foundation phase GARUDA will be based on stable version of GT4. The resource management and scheduling in GARUDA is based on a deployment of industry grade schedulers in a hierarchical architecture. At the cluster level, scheduling is achieved through Load Leveler for AIX platforms and Torque for Linux clusters. Grid Access Methods The GARUDA portal which provides the user interface to the Grid resources hides the complexity of the Grid from the users. It allows submission of both sequential and parallel jobs and also provides job accounting facilities. Problem Solving Environment (PSE) in the domains of Bio-informatics, and Community Atmospheric Model support the entire cycle of problem solving for the specific domains by supporting problem formulation, algorithm selection, numerical simulation and solution visualization.

Like many places in the region, G√∂rwihl belonged to the county Hauenstein within Further Austria. It became the centre of legal activity for the region and played a role in the peasants' uprising. In 1806, G√∂rwihl became part of the newly created Grand Duchy of Baden. The community in its present scale was developed in the context of Baden- Wurttemberg regional reform. Rotzingen joined the municipality of G√∂rwihl in 1971 and Hartschwand in 1972, with the other districts following in 1975. Geography G√∂rwihl is within the Hotzenwald region, and lies in the southernmost part of the Black Forest, at the edge of the River Alb, a tributary of the Rhine. The landscape of the region is characterized by high plateaus of various sizes, the stepped terraces descending toward the south. About 60% of the area within the town boundary consists of forest.

The rings used by jugglers are typically about in diameter and thick. Juggling rings are easier to juggle than clubs, but harder than balls due to size and throwing mechanics. Because of rings' impressive appearance for their level of difficulty, they remain a popular juggling item.  Use in juggling  When juggled, rings are typically spun about their central axis. The resulting gyroscopic motion of the ring allows it to keep the same orientation after it is thrown.Finnigan, Dave, Dorothy, & Ben, Juggling From Start to Star, p 79, Human Kinetics 2002. This property is utilized by performers to achieve various visual effects. For example, a performer might intentionally juggle some rings with the broad side to the audience and some others with the edge to the audience. As with balls and clubs, the most basic patterns of ring juggling are the cascade and fountain. In these patterns, the left and right hands alternate throwing rings at approximately the same height. Some ball and club tricks can also be performed with rings, but their unique shape and spinning abilities result in a different visual effect. Several patterns and tricks are unique to rings. For example, a spinning ring oriented vertically can be cradled and spun on a ring that is held horizontally. Rings can be spun along different axes resulting in a trick called \\"pancake flips.\\" \\"Color change\\" involves rings colored differently on both sides, the performers catch the ring hand facing up and then throw the ring with the hand facing down, giving the appearance that the ring has changed. One of the most common tricks unique to rings is the \\"pull down.\\" In this trick, usually used at the end of a performance routine, each of the rings is caught and placed over the performers neck in sequence. Because of their thinness, light weight, and relative ease of collecting, rings are often used for juggling high numbers of props. Jugglers often wear gloves or other protection when juggling more than four rings, as the height of the pattern, thin cross-section and hard plastic of rings can act like blades and lead to chafing.Finnigan, Dave, Dorothy, & Ben, Juggling From Start to Star, p 86, Human Kinetics 2002.  In passing  It is possible, but not the norm, to pass rings in basic patterns such as four count and solids; for example, in the Cirque du Soleil production Corteo, the jugglers passed with multiple rings. Since rings are circularly symmetric, two or more jugglers can rotate each ring by any degree around its axis of symmetry, thus resulting in a throw and catch that is independent of the number of turns the ring makes around its axis of symmetry. This contrasts with club juggling, which when passed in a normal passing pattern, do not rotate around their axis of symmetry.  Records  The record for the most juggling rings juggled (where each prop is thrown and caught at least twice) is ten rings for forty-seven catches, by Anthony Gatto in 2006.JISCON Juggling Records The record for the most juggling rings flashed (where each prop is thrown and caught once) is thirteen, by Albert Lucas in 2002.

The Gyromax is the trade name for an adjustable mass (or adjustable inertia) balance wheel used in Patek Philippe wristwatches. Instead of weight adjustment screws on the outside of the rim, as in traditional balances, the Gyromax has turnable weights recessed into the top of the rim. The advantages claimed for this design are that, without projecting weight screws, the diameter of the balance can be increased, giving it a larger moment of inertia, and that it has less air resistance. The Gyromax balance has six to eight small turnable weights that fit on pins located in recesses around the top of the balance wheel rim. Each of the weights, called collets, has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When the collet's cutout points to the outside of the balance wheel, the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the balance wheel turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual collet to adjust the wheel's balance, referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to adjust the wheel's rotation speed. The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the wheel's balance spring for adjusting the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate. Swiss patents were granted to Patek Phillipe for the Gyromax balance on May 15, 1949 and December 31, 1951, and the balance was first used in watches in 1952. Another balance wheel with a similar design is the Rolex Microstella.

(2010) examined phylogenetic relationships among 50 taxa of this family using a supermatrix approach (concatenation of the 16S, internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 genes) involving both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Her phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the existence of three deep clades of Lymnaeidae representing the main geographic origin of species (America, Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region). It demonstrates that the nomenclature of most genera in the Lymnaeidae does not reflect evolutionary relationships. A cladogram based on sequences of 16S, internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 genes showing phylogenic relations of Lymnaeidae by Correa et al. (2010): The nomenclature of genera has been one of the most confusing issues in the Lymnaeidae systematics. Most genus names are not fixed and are based more on phenotypic resemblances than on sound evolutionary and phylogenetic considerations. For instance, a single genus in Lymnaeidae was recognized by Walter (1968),Walter H. J. (1968). \\"Evolution, taxonomic revolution, and zoogeography of the Lymnaeidae\\".

Hamburg, Germany: Deutscher Jugendbund f√ºr Naturbeobachtung. Results by Correa et al. (2010) indicate that genera in Lymnaeidae do not reflect phylogenetic relationships, to the notable exception of Radix (including Radix natalensis). The type species of Lymnaea is Lymnaea stagnalis Linnaeus, 1758; the type species of Stagnicola Jeffreys, 1830 is Stagnicola palustris (= Lymnaea palustris); and the type species of Omphiscola Rafinesque, 1819 is Omphiscola glabra. However, it is clear that these three species belong to the same clade (C2) and that Lymnaea is not a monophyletic group. Correa et al. (2010) proposed that species of clade C2 should all be called Lymnaea, according to the principle of priority of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). By extension, Stagnicola should not be used to name species in clade C1a since the type species belongs to clade C2. Meier-Brook & Bargues (2002)Meier-Brook C. & Bargues M. D. (2002). \\"Catascopia, a new genus for three Nearctic and one Palaearctic stagnicoline species (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae)\\".

The phylogeny by Correa et al. (2010) does not conflict with this nomenclature, although it would seem preferable to identify all species of clade C1a with the same name to reflect the close evolutionary relationships among these species. Hinkleyia would be the preferable name according to the ICZN. On the other hand, at least four genera names have been used for species of clade C1b: Lymnaea Lamarck, 1799; Galba Schrank, 1803; Fossaria Westerlund, 1885; and Bakerilymnaea. In the light of the present results, it would be preferable to unify nomenclature. According to the ICZN, Lymnaea should be the unified name, but given that the type species belongs to clade C2, Galba could be a more appropriate name. Finally, as said above, Austropeplea Cotton, 1942 is not a monophyletic group, and employing the genus Kutikina Ponder & Waterhouse, 1997 (one species: Kutikina hispida) seems unjustified on the basis of the current phylogeny. This would also be consistent with results of Puslednik et al. (2009). It would be preferable to use Bullastra Pfeiffer, 1839 for all species of clade C3a to fit the ICZN.

An unidentified fragmentary lymnaeid from deposits of the Meyer Desert Formation (reported in 2003) was the first freshwater snail recorded from Antarctica.  Description  This family exhibits a great diversity in shell morphology but extremely homogeneous anatomical traits. Diversity of shell morphology is linked to substantial eco-phenotypic plasticity. Hubendick (1951)Hubendick B. (1951). \\"Recent Lymnaeidae, their variation, morphology, taxonomy, nomenclature and distribution\\". Kungl Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar 3: 1-223. illustrated this point by compiling up to 1143 species names, a large number of which he synonymized. In contrast, the anatomy of their reproductive tracts (including prostate, penis and preputium) is extremely homogeneous. Immunological, cytogenetical, enzyme electrophoresis studies, and DNA-based approaches have demonstrated extensive homoplasy in anatomical characters.  Ecology  Lymnaeidae are of major medical and veterinary importance since they act as vectors of parasites (helminths, mainly trematodes, e.g., Fasciola liver flukes) that severely affect human populations and livestock, and cause important economic losses. Lymnaeids serve as intermediate hosts of at least 71 trematode species distributed among 13 families, including some species of Schistosomatidae and Echinostomatidae, with implications for human health, and Paramphistomum daubneyi, which is of veterinary interest. The most emblematic case of parasite transmitted by lymnaeids is Fasciola hepatica (Digenea: Fasciolidae), the agent of fascioliasis. Mollusks, generally lymnaeids, are required as intermediate hosts to complete the life cycle of Fasciola hepatica. At least 20 species of Lymnaeidae have been described as potential vectors of fascioliasis. References This article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from the reference  Further reading  * Baker F. C.

The screenplay by Dean Craig focuses on a family attempting to resolve a variety of problems while attending the funeral of the patriarch. Plot In England, Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) live with his parents, while Daniel's brother Robert (Rupert Graves) is a renowned novelist living in New York City. The story begins on the day of their father's funeral. Robert arrives, having flown first class, but declines to help finance the funeral, leaving Daniel to cover all the expenses. As guests begin to arrive, Daniel struggles to complete a eulogy, even though everyone expects Robert will be the one to deliver it. Daniel's cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan) and her fianc√© Simon (Alan Tudyk) are desperate to make a good impression on Martha's father Victor (Peter Egan). Their hopes for doing so are dashed when Martha, hoping to calm Simon's nerves, gives him what she believes is Valium but is actually a hallucinogenic designer drug manufactured by her brother Troy (Kris Marshall), a pharmacy student. An American man named Peter (Peter Dinklage) introduces himself to Daniel, who is too busy to speak to him and suggests they talk later. The service begins and the hallucinating Simon, certain he sees the coffin moving, tips it over, causing the body to spill out onto the floor. During the ensuing chaos, Simon is told why he is acting as he is, so he panics and locks himself in the bathroom. Martha tries to persuade him to open the door while fending off the unwelcome advances of Justin (Ewen Bremner), with whom she once had a one-night stand that she would like to forget. Simon climbs onto the roof while naked and threatens to jump. While most of the guests are watching Simon on the roof, Peter meets privately with Daniel and Robert and reveals he was their father's lover. Unhappy that he was left nothing in their father's will, Peter shows them compromising photographs, trying to blackmail the family for ¬£15,000. The brothers panic, bind and gag Peter, and give him what they believe is Valium to calm him down. Peter manages to free himself, but falls and hits his head on a glass coffee table. Troy and germaphobic family friend Howard (Andy Nyman) believe Peter to be dead. Forced to dispose of the body as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, Daniel and Robert place it in the casket with their father. Martha tells Simon that she is pregnant and she takes him off the roof, much to everyone's relief. Once everyone returns, the service resumes. Daniel's awkward eulogy is interrupted when the still-alive Peter leaps from the coffin and the photos fall out for everyone, including Daniel and Robert's mother Sandra (Jane Asher), to see. Daniel demands everyone to stay calm, declares his father was a good man, although clearly one with secrets, and finally proceeds to deliver an impromptu tribute. In the evening, after all the mourners (including Peter) have gone, Robert tells Daniel that he plans on taking their mother to New York so that Daniel and Jane can finally buy their own flat. Their conversation is interrupted when Jane tells them that Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan) had a panic attack over Simon, so she gave him some \\"Valium\\". The film ends with Uncle Alfie on the roof naked, as Simon had been.

It premiered at the European Film Market in February 2007 and was shown at the US Comedy Arts Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival, the Breckenridge Film Festival, the Maui Film Festival, the Sydney Film Festival, the Provincetown International Film Festival, and the Tremblant Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States on 17 August 2007. It opened throughout Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia before going into theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2007. Release=Critical reception , the film holds a 62% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 132 reviews with an average score of 5.84/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Death at a Funeral is a rousing British farce, with enough slapstick silliness to overcome its faults.\\" Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle said the film is \\"in the tradition of those classics, in black-and-white and starring Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness, in which disasters keep piling up, each one more drolly funny than the last. That's high praise for Death but no more than it deserves. The humor manages to be simultaneously sophisticated, supremely silly and very dark...The casting couldn't be better. With no big stars to upset the balance, the actors work together as a true ensemble, the best since Little Miss Sunshine.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated it three out of four stars and commented, \\"The movie is part farce (unplanned entrances and exits), part slapstick (misbehavior of corpses) and part just plain wacky eccentricity. I think the ideal way to see it would be to gather your most dour and disapproving relatives and treat them to a night at the cinema.\\" Sid Smith of the Chicago Tribune called the film \\"lethal farce, combining hints of The Lavender Hill Mob, doses of Joe Orton and a smidgen of the Farrelly brothers' scatology in its mix.\\" He added, \\"The sibling rivalry/resolution meant to give the movie its sweet, heartfelt thread is weak, and there are stretches in which the comedy sags or settles for the predictable. But Death provides an adult tonic in a season typically abandoned to the comic book cocktail. There are worse ways to escape the August heat.\\" Steve Dollar of the New York Sun said, \\"The ensemble approach allows for a maximum of comic scenarios to be put into effect, as the film's motor revs into higher and higher gear. Expert pacing and delivery, as well as the abundance of hyper-articulate, over-educated, effervescently British character types, ratchet up the cringe factor accordingly. The film's antic disposition, or rather its disposition toward antics, may strike some as an exercise in overkill, even though, curiously, the film disappointingly resolves all the comic trauma by letting everyone off the hook. Moreover, a lot of the material, especially the closeted-gay jokes, seems dated. But for Mr. Oz, finger-snap pacing and an expert cast (surely familiar to any BBC America viewer) bring this Death to giddy life.\\" Philip French of The Observer said the film, \\"in which a fine British cast is wasted on feeble material, is directed by Frank Oz in less than wizardly form.\\" Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian rated it two out of five stars and commented, \\"Scientists believe that black holes can slow down the progress of time. A similar effect can be felt by viewers of this damp squib of a farce as it grinds on from one lame set-up to the next. This sort of sub-Alan Ayckbourn trawl might work on stage but never on the big screen, where all the deficiencies of the form are thrown into sharp relief. From Oz downwards, the credits are full of familiar names foolishly squandering the goodwill their past works have generated.\\" Box office The film eventually earned $46,600,669, split $8,580,428 in North America and the equivalent of $38,020,241 in other markets. It opened in 260 theatres in the United States on 17 August 2007 and grossed $1,282,973 on its opening weekend, ranking #17 at the box office. Awards Director Frank Oz won the Audience Award at both the US Comedy Arts Festival and the Locarno International Film Festival. Home media The Region 1 DVD was released on 26 February 2008. Viewers have the option of watching the film in either anamorphic widescreen or fullscreen format. It has audio tracks in English and Spanish and subtitles in English, Spanish, and Cantonese.

The suburb is approximately 36.4 km from the Adelaide city centre. It lies within the City of Onkaparinga local government area, and neighbours the suburbs Seaford, Maslin Beach, Seaford Rise and Port Noarlunga Beach front The Gulf St Vincent beach front at Moana is a combination of low cliffs, sand dunes, and hard compacted sand. The beach at Moana is accessible by normal passenger vehicles and is one of the few beaches where cars are allowed to drive onto the beach. History Moana was originally farming land from 1841. In the 1850s a local landowner lent his name to the beach and it became known as Dodd's Beach. In 1855, when shipping was the primary means of cargo transport in the area, the Nashwauk was wrecked on the beach near the Pedler Creek outlet. Due to an increased interest in tourism in the area, in 1927 the land was subdivided by Lake Beach Estate Ltd who held a competition to name the new town. Mr C.H. Cave won the competition with \\"Moana\\", which is a MƒÅori-language word meaning \\"ocean\\". The land was divided into blocks of land suitable for holiday homes and wide streets were planned and laid out, but due to the Great Depression in 1929 development of the area was slow. In the 1950s Moana experienced renewed interest from tourism as the residents of Adelaide enjoyed the freedom and mobility of car ownership - Moana was a pleasant 40 minute drive from Adelaide. One of the landmarks of the area was the Moana Roundhouse which was demolished in 2006. In recent times, the urban sprawl of Adelaide has reached Moana (and beyond) and so Moana is now one of Adelaide's outer southern suburbs. Geography In the Ochre Point reserve area south of town Moana is a seaside suburb. It is divided into two by Pedlar Creek and the associated sand dune reserve. The northern part of the Moana is referred to as the \\"old survey Moana\\" and the southern housing development as the \\"new survey\\". The Coast to Vines rail trail passes through Moana. There was a station at Moana on the former Marino-Willunga rail line that it follows. Transport Moana is serviced by the 741, 745, 747, 749 and 750 bus routes which terminate at the Centro Colonnades and Noarlunga Centre Interchange. Attractions Moana beach Moana has a clean white sandy beach, a caravan park, an RSL hall and kiosk. Moana has a Surf Life saving Club which patrols the beach over summer. It is one of the last beaches in Adelaide where a vehicle can be driven onto the beach and parked legally. In 2008 the foreshore area of \\"old survey\\" Moana has undergone redevelopment by the local council, with improvements to the road, walkway, and sea wall. A new toilet block and shaded \\"gazebo\\", the latter shaped in the form of a seagull, have been added to the foreshore area. A sloping ramp at the north end of the foreshore that originally provided access to the beach was damaged by erosion of the cliffs during storm activity in 2007. The local council are improving the cliff stability under the ramp. The council have removed the sloping ramp, but the concrete stairway at the north end of Moana beach is unaffected by these changes.

The exact form of the Iranian name Osru≈°ana is not clear from the sources, but the forms given in Hudud al-'alam, indicate an original *Soru≈°na.  History  The rulers of the Oshrusana or Ustrushana (Istarawshan) went by the title of \\"Afshin\\", and the most famous of whom was KhedƒÅr (Arabicised Haydar) b. KƒÅv≈´s. Our early knowledge of the ruling family of Oshrusana is derived from the accounts by the Islamic historians (Tabari, Baladhuri, and Ya'qubi) of the final subjugation of that region by the 'Abbasid caliphs and the submission of its rulers to Islam. During the time when the first Arab invasion of the country took place under Qutayba ibn Muslim (94-5/712-14), Ushrusana was inhabited by an Iranian population, ruled by its own princes who bore the traditional title of Akhshid or Afshin.Kramers, J.H. \\"Usr≈´shana\\". Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007 The first invasion by the Arabs did not result in them controlling the area. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: Bunjikat wall painting of goddess Nana, 8th-9th century. However, during the reign of the caliph al- Mahdi (775-85) the Afshin of Oshrusana is mentioned among several Iranian and Turkic rulers of Transoxania and the Central Asian steppes who submitted nominally to him.Yaqubi, II, p.479. But it was not until Harun al-Rashid's reign in 794-95 that Fadl ibn Yahya of the Barmakids led an expedition into Transoxania and received the submission of the ruling Akin,whose name, by inference from Tabari, III, p. 1066, was something like KharƒÅkana; according to Gardƒ´zƒ´ led. Habibi, p. 130 this KharƒÅkana had never previously humbled himself before any other potentate. Further expeditions were nevertheless sent to Oshrusana by Ma'm≈´n when he was governor in Marv and after he had become Caliph. Afshin Kavus, son of the Afshin KarƒÅkana who had submitted to Fadl ibn Yahya, withdrew his allegiance from the Arabs; but shortly after Ma'mun arrived in Baghdad from the east (817-18 or 819-20), a power struggle and dissensions broke out among the reigning family of Oshrusana. Kawus' son Khaydar, known by his royal title of Afshin, became a general in the Abbasid army and fought against Khurramite rebels and their leader Babak Khoramdin in Azerbaijan (816-837). In 841 Afshin was arrested in Samarra on suspicion of plotting against the Caliphate. A single location was used for the crucifixion of Afshin, Maziyar, and Babak's corpses. After his death Ustrushana was Islamified whereas before he preserved temples from ruin. There are indications that semi-autonomous Afshins continued to rule over the Ustrushana after control of the region was wrested from the Abbasids by the Saffarids and, soon after, the Samanids.

In 1270 it received the right to hold a market from Louis II, Duke of Bavaria as recorded in an Urbarium. It was a commercial center due to its location on the Vils and Lauterach rivers, as well as the site of one of the largest hammer works in that era. The city was a local seat of government and belonged to the Munich line of the House of Wittelsbach. In 1505, Schmidm√ºhlen was incorporated along with other properties of Bavarian Nordgau in the newly created Duchy of Pfalz-Neuburg. The border of the Upper Palatinate was three kilometers to the north, which always led to clashes, especially with the powerful city of Amberg. During the War of Spanish Succession, the so-called Battle of Schmidm√ºhlen took place in 1703. With Karl Theodor von Pfalz-Sulzbach becoming Elector Duke of Bavaria in 1778 government takeover, the area was again part of the Electorate of Bavaria, but the areas were incorporated only after the Napoleonic Wars of the Upper Palatinate. Schmidm√ºhlen possessed a market court with magisterial proper rights. As part of the administrative reforms in Bavaria, in the community edict (the 'Gemeindeedikt von 1818') of 1818, the present municipality, which was closely linked to Burglengenfeld as a seat of justice and later as county seat until the local reform. Today Schmidm√ºhlen is the southernmost municipality of Amberg-Sulzbach. This brought a reorientation in the north, which had started 100 years ago with the construction of the railway line Amberg-Schmidm√ºhlen (1910-1985, now part of the Five Rivers Cycle Route).

The lights are manufactured by Strong Lighting of Omaha, NE which acquired the Super Trouper and its larger cousin, the Gladiator, from its former manufacturer Syncrolite who had acquired them from Ballantyne Strong of Omaha, Nebraska (originally Strong Electric Corporation of Toledo, Ohio) in November 2016. The Super Trouper is also the subject of the 1980 ABBA song.ABBA - The Making of Super Trouper The lights were first manufactured in 1956. Initially, the Super Trouper utilized a high-intensity carbon arc lamp, which produced an almost snow white spot that set the performer apart from ambient stage lighting. In the 1980s and as carbon arc lamps fell into decreasing use, the spotlight began to employ a high-intensity xenon lamp as its light source. Because of the Super Trouper's brilliant light field, many performers specify it in their technical riders. A large segment of U.S. entertainment venues, including proscenium theaters and arenas, continue to utilize Strong Super Troupers as their primary follow spotlights and it remains the \\"standard\\" that all other spotlights are generally judged against. The Super Trouper line of xenon follow spots is inclusive of four production models: Super Trouper Long Throw, Super Trouper Short Throw, Super Trouper Medium Throw, and Super Trouper II. Each model is available in either a 1600 watt or a 2000 watt variety. As of 2006, Strong has limited production of Super Trouper Short Throws and Medium Throws to special request only. With very few exceptions, Strong has maintained a consistent design on Super Trouper models since the first xenon- type models were introduced in the late 1970s. Initially the reflector unit was composed of electroformed nickel with a rhodium plating. Today, Super Trouper follow spots are shipped from the factory with a similarly-designed nickel reflector, though a dichroic coating has supplanted the rhodium coating. The xenon-type Super Troupers had utilized a larger \\"AC\\" igniter assembly, which had been specially designed to function with the original high-reactance power supplies. As suggested by the name however, Super Troupers were intended for portability and \\"trouping\\" and the bulky two hundred pound (90 kg) plus power supplies were not conducive to travel environments. Strong introduced their first version of the solid-state switching 1 kW-3 kW power supply for their xenon follow spots in 1988, without having to engineer any modifications to the Super Trouper's operational design. This new solid-state power supply unit weighed in at approximately sixty-five pounds (30 kg), which was roughly one third the weight of its high reactance predecessor. Strong introduced the Super Trouper II model xenon follow spot in 1995 as the first new follow spot design since the xenon Gladiator III in 1983. With it, Strong also released a new \\"DC\\" ignitor assembly, which was a simpler and more reliable version of its predecessor: the \\"AC\\" ignitor. It allowed for a shorter ignition time and required less space than the standard AC ignitors found in standard Super Trouper followspots. Then, in 1997, with the introduction of Strong's new, compact 1 kW-3 kW switching power supply it became clear that the existing AC ignitor assemblies in the original Super Trouper (and not Super Trouper II's) were not functionally compatible with the new power supplies. Over the next several years, DC ignitor assemblies began to gradually replace the older AC ignitors.

UFO incident, also known as the Washington flap, the Washington National Airport Sightings, or the Invasion of Washington,(Peebles, p. 73) was a series of unidentified flying object reports from July 12 to July 29, 1952, over Washington, D.C. The most publicized sightings took place on consecutive weekends, July 19‚Äì20 and July 26‚Äì27. UFO historian Curtis Peebles called the incident \\"the climax of the 1952 (UFO) flap\\" - \\"Never before or after did Project Blue Book and the Air Force undergo such a tidal wave of (UFO) reports.\\"(Peebles, p. 78) Events of July 19‚Äì20 At 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1952, Edward Nugent, an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport (today Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), spotted seven objects on his radar.Carlson, Peter; Carlson, Peter (21 July 2002). \\"50 Years Ago, Unidentified Flying Objects From Way Beyond the Beltway Seized the Capital's Imagination\\". The Washington Post. The objects were located 15 miles (24 km) south-southwest of the city; no known aircraft were in the area and the objects were not following any established flight paths. Nugent's superior, Harry Barnes, a senior air-traffic controller at the airport, watched the objects on Nugent's radarscope. He later wrote: :We knew immediately that a very strange situation existed . . . their movements were completely radical compared to those of ordinary aircraft.(Clark, p. 653) Barnes had two controllers check Nugent's radar; they found that it was working normally. Barnes then called National Airport's radar-equipped control tower; the controllers there, Howard Cocklin and Joe Zacko, said that they also had unidentified blips on their radar screen, and that they had seen \\"a bright light hovering in the sky...[it] took off, zooming away at incredible speed.\\" Cocklin asked Zacko \\"Did you see that? What the hell was that?\\" At this point, other objects appeared in all sectors of the radarscope; when they moved over the White House and the United States Capitol, Barnes called Andrews Air Force Base, located 10 miles from National Airport. Although Andrews reported that they had no unusual objects on their radar, an airman soon called the base's control tower to report the sighting of a strange object. Airman William Brady, who was in the tower, then saw an \\"object which appeared to be like an orange ball of fire, trailing a tail . . . [it was] unlike anything I had ever seen before.\\" As Brady tried to alert the other personnel in the tower, the strange object \\"took off at an unbelievable speed.\\" On one of National Airport's runways, S.C. Pierman, a Capital Airlines pilot, was waiting in the cockpit of his DC-4 for permission to take off. After spotting what he believed to be a meteor, he was told that the control tower's radar had detected unknown objects closing in on his position. Pierman observed six objects ‚Äî \\"white, tailless, fast-moving lights\\" ‚Äî over a 14-minute period. Pierman was in radio contact with Barnes during his sighting, and Barnes later related that \\"each sighting coincided with a pip we could see near his plane. When he reported that the light streaked off at a high speed, it disappeared on our scope.\\"\\"Saucers Full of Secrets\\". Meanwhile, at Andrews Air Force Base, the control tower personnel were tracking on radar what some thought to be unknown objects, but others suspected, and in one instance were able to prove, were simply stars and meteors.(Peebles, p. 74) However, Staff Sgt. Charles Davenport observed an orange-red light to the south; the light \\"would appear to stand still, then make an abrupt change in direction and altitude . . . this happened several times.\\" At one point both radar centers at National Airport and the radar at Andrews Air Force Base were tracking an object hovering over a radio beacon. The object vanished in all three radar centers at the same time.(Ruppelt, p. 160) At 3 a.m., shortly before two United States Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington, all of the objects vanished from the radar at National Airport. However, when the jets ran low on fuel and left, the objects returned, which convinced Barnes that \\"the UFOs were monitoring radio traffic and behaving accordingly.\\" The objects were last detected by radar at 5:30 a.m. Publicity and Air Force reaction The sightings of July 19‚Äì20, 1952, made front-page headlines in newspapers around the nation. A typical example was the headline from the Cedar Rapids Gazette in Iowa. It read \\"SAUCERS SWARM OVER CAPITAL\\" in large black type.(Michaels, p. 22) By coincidence, USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the supervisor of the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation into UFO sightings, was in Washington at the time. However, he did not learn about the sightings until Monday, July 21, when he read the headlines in a Washington-area newspaper.(Ruppelt, p. 210) After talking with intelligence officers at the Pentagon about the sightings, Ruppelt spent several hours trying to obtain a staff car so he could travel around Washington to investigate the sightings, but was refused as only generals and senior colonels could use staff cars. He was told that he could rent a taxicab with his own money; by this point Ruppelt was so frustrated that he left Washington and flew back to Blue Book's headquarters at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio.(Ruppelt, p. 162) Upon returning to Dayton, Ruppelt spoke with an Air Force radar specialist, Captain Roy James, who felt that unusual weather conditions could have caused the unknown radar targets.(Ruppelt, p. 163) Events of July 26‚Äì27 At 8:15 p.m. on Saturday, July 26, 1952, a pilot and stewardess on a National Airlines flight into Washington observed some lights above their plane. Within minutes, both radar centers at National Airport, and the radar at Andrews AFB, were tracking more unknown objects.(Peebles, pp. 75-76) USAF master sergeant Charles E. Cummings visually observed the objects at Andrews, he later said that \\"these lights did not have the characteristics of shooting stars. There was [sic] no trails . . . they traveled faster than any shooting star I have ever seen.\\" Meanwhile, Albert M. Chop, the press spokesman for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport and, due to security concerns, denied several reporters' requests to photograph the radar screens. He then joined the radar center personnel.(Ruppelt, p. 164) By this time (9:30 p.m.) the radar center was detecting unknown objects in every sector. At times the objects traveled slowly; at other times they reversed direction and moved across the radarscope at speeds calculated at up to 7,000 mph (11,250 km/h).(Ruppelt, p. 159) At 11:30 p.m., two U.S. Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington. Captain John McHugo, the flight leader, was vectored towards the radar blips but saw nothing, despite repeated attempts.(Peebles, p. 76) However, his wingman, Lieutenant William Patterson, did see four white \\"glows\\" and chased them. He later said that \\"I tried to make contact with the bogies below 1,000 feet. I was at my maximum speed...I ceased chasing them because I saw no chance of overtaking them.\\" According to Albert Chop, when ground control asked Patterson \\"if he saw anything\\", Patterson replied \\"'I see them now and they're all around me. What should I do?'...And nobody answered, because we didn't know what to tell him.\\" After midnight on July 27, USAF Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book's liaison at the Pentagon, and Lt. John Holcomb, a United States Navy radar specialist, arrived at the radar center at National Airport. During the night, Lieutenant Holcomb received a call from the Washington National Weather Station. They told him that a slight temperature inversion was present over the city, but Holcomb felt that the inversion was not \\"nearly strong enough to explain the 'good and solid' returns\\" on the radarscopes. Fournet relayed that all those present in the radar room were convinced that the targets were most likely caused by solid metallic objects. There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but this was a common occurrence and the controllers \\"were paying no attention to them.\\"(Ruppelt, p. 166) Two more F-94s from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled during the night. One pilot saw nothing unusual; the other pilot saw a white light which \\"vanished\\" when he moved towards it. Additionally, \\"civilian planes flying into Washington reported seeing strange glowing objects in places where the radar was getting blips.\\" As on July 20, the sightings and unknown radar returns ended at sunrise.(Ruppelt, p. 165) White House concern and CIA interest The sightings of July 26‚Äì27 also made front- page headlines, and led President Harry Truman to have his air force aide call Ruppelt and ask for an explanation of the sightings and unknown radar returns. Truman listened to the conversation between the two men on a separate phone, but did not ask questions himself.(Peebles, p. 77) Ruppelt, remembering the conversation he had with Captain James, told the president's assistant that the sightings might have been caused by a temperature inversion, in which a layer of warm, moist air covers a layer of cool, dry air closer to the ground. This condition can cause radar signals to bend and give false returns. However, Ruppelt had not yet interviewed any of the witnesses or conducted a formal investigation. CIA historian Gerald Haines, in his 1997 history of the CIA's involvement with UFOs, also mentions Truman's concern. \\"A massive buildup of sightings over the United States in 1952, especially in July, alarmed the Truman administration. On 19 and 20 July, radar scopes at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked mysterious blips. On 27 July, the blips reappeared.\\" The CIA would react to the 1952 wave of UFO reports by \\"forming a special study group within the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) and Office of Current Intelligence (OCI) to review the situation. Edward Tauss reported for the group that most UFO sightings could be easily explained. Nonetheless, he recommended that the Agency continue monitoring the problem.\\" The CIA's concern with the issue would lead to the creation, in January 1953, of the Robertson Panel. Air Force explanation Air Force Major Generals John Samford, USAF Director of Intelligence, and Roger Ramey, USAF Director of Operations, held a well- attended press conference at the Pentagon on July 29, 1952. At the event, Samford stated that the visual sightings over Washington could be explained as misidentified aerial phenomena such as stars or meteors, and unknown radar targets could be explained by temperature inversion, which was present in the air over Washington on both nights the radar returns were reported. In addition, Samford stated that the unknown radar contacts were not caused by solid material objects, and therefore posed no threat to national security. In response to a question as to whether the Air Force had recorded similar UFO radar contacts prior to the Washington incident, Samford said that there had been \\"hundreds\\" of such contacts where Air Force fighter interceptions had taken place, but stated they were all \\"fruitless.\\"\\"Page 2 Project Blue Book - UFO Investigations - Fold3\\". Minutes of Press Conference Held By Major General John A. Samford Director of Intelligence, U.S. air Force 29 July 1952 - 4:00p.m. - Room 3E-869, The Pentagon. It was the largest Pentagon press conference since World War II.(Peebles, p. 80) Press stories called Samford and Ramey the Air Force's two top UFO experts.\\"Los Angeles Times: Archives - U.S. SAUCER HUNTER DOUBTS THEY EXIST\\". pqasb.pqarchiver.com. Among the witnesses who supported Samford's explanation was the crew of a B-25 bomber, which had been flying over Washington during the sightings of July 26‚Äì27. The bomber was vectored several times by National Airport over unknown targets on the airport's radarscopes, yet the crew could see nothing unusual. Finally, as a crew member related, \\"the radar had a target which turned out to be the Wilson Lines steamboat trip to Mount Vernon... the radar was sure as hell picking up the steamboat.\\"(Ruppelt, p. 170) Air Force Captain Harold May was in the radar center at Andrews AFB during the sightings of July 19‚Äì20. Upon hearing that National Airport's radar had picked up an unknown object heading in his direction, May stepped outside and saw \\"a light that was changing from red to orange to green to red again...at times it dipped suddenly and appeared to lose altitude.\\" However, May eventually concluded that he was simply seeing a star that was distorted by the atmosphere, and that its \\"movement\\" was an illusion.(Peebles, p. 62) At 3 a.m. on July 27, an Eastern Airlines flight over Washington was told that an unknown object was in its vicinity; the crew could see nothing unusual. When they were told that the object had moved directly behind their plane, they began a sharp turn to try to see the object, but were told by National Airport's radar center that the object had \\"disappeared\\" when they began their turn. At the request of the Air Force, the CAA's Technical Development and Evaluation Center did an analysis of the radar sightings. Their conclusion was that \\"a temperature inversion had been indicated in almost every instance when the unidentified radar targets or visual objects had been reported.\\"(Peebles, p. 66) Project Blue Book would eventually label the unknown Washington radar blips as false images caused by temperature inversion, and the visual sightings as misidentified meteors, stars, and city lights.(Peebles, p. 79) In later years two prominent UFO skeptics, Dr. Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University, and Philip Klass, a senior editor for Aviation Week magazine, would also argue in favor of the temperature inversion/mirage hypothesis.(Peebles, p. 360) In 2002 Klass told a reporter that \\"radar technology in 1952 wasn't sophisticated enough to filter out many ordinary objects, such as flocks of birds, weather balloons, or temperature inversions.\\" The reporter added that \\"UFO proponents argue that even then seasoned controllers could differentiate between spurious targets and solid, metallic objects. Klass disagrees. It may be that 'we had two dumb controllers at National Airport on those nights'...[Klass] added that the introduction of digital filters in the 1970s led to a steep decline in UFO sightings on radar.\\" Criticisms of the Air Force explanation In his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, author Edward J. Ruppelt wrote that radar and control tower personnel he spoke to, as well as some Air Force officers, disagreed with the Air Force's explanation. Michael Wertheimer, a researcher for the government-funded Condon Report, investigated the case in 1966, and stated that radar witnesses still disputed the Air Force explanation.\\"Condon Report, Sec III, Chapter 5: Optical & Radar Analysis\\". files.ncas.org. According to ufologist Jerome Clark, some people claimed to see structured craft in the sky.(Clark, p. 657) Howard Cocklin told a Washington Post reporter in 2002 that he was still \\"convinced that he saw an object over Washington National...I saw it on the [radar] screen and out the window...it was a whitish-blue object. Not a light - a solid form...a saucer- shaped object.\\" The Robertson Panel The extremely high numbers of UFO reports in 1952 disturbed both the Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both groups felt that an enemy nation could deliberately flood the U.S. with false UFO reports, causing mass panic and allowing them to launch a sneak attack. On September 24, 1952, the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) sent a memorandum to Walter B. Smith, the CIA's Director. The memo stated that \\"the flying saucer situation . . . [has] national security implications . . . [in] the public concern with the phenomena . . . lies the potential for the touching-off of mass hysteria and panic.\\" The result of this memorandum was the creation in January 1953 of the Robertson Panel. Dr. Howard P. Robertson, a physicist, chaired the panel, which consisted of prominent scientists and which spent four days examining the \\"best\\" UFO cases collected by Project Blue Book. The panel dismissed nearly all of the UFO cases it examined as not representing anything unusual or threatening to national security. In the panel's controversial estimate, the Air Force and Project Blue Book needed to spend less time analyzing and studying UFO reports and more time publicly debunking them. The panel recommended that the Air Force and Project Blue Book should take steps to \\"strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired.\\"(Peebles, p. 102) Following the panel's recommendation, Project Blue Book would rarely publicize any UFO case that it had not labeled as \\"solved\\"; unsolved cases were rarely mentioned by the Air Force.

These cast iron rails, developed by William Jessop and others, only allowed very low speeds and broke easily and although steam locomotives had been tested as early as 1804 by Richard Trevithick, these experiments had not been economically successful as the rails frequently broke. \\"John Birkinshaw's 1820 patent for rolling wrought-iron rails in 15ft lengths was a vital breakthrough for the infant railway system. Wrought iron was able to withstand the moving load of a locomotive and train unlike cast iron, used for rails until then, which was brittle and fractured all too easily.\\"Specification of John Birkinshaw's Patent], for an Improvement in the Construction of Malleable Iron Rails, to be used in Rail roads; with Remarks on the comparative Merits of Cast Metal and Malleable Iron Rail-ways. Michael Longridge, Newcastle: E. Walker, 1821. Remark: the 1838 edition (online here) does not contain the quoted sentences. Birkinshaw's wrought iron rails were taken up by George Stephenson in 1821 for the proposed Stockton and Darlington Railway, despite the fact that Stephenson already held the rights to the best cast iron product,The Bedlington Rail and it was this railway that effectively launched the rail era. Career * In 1821, whilst an engineer at Bedlington Ironworks, Birkinshaw developed a new method of rolling wrought iron rails in fifteen feet lengths.George Stephenson * His son John Cass Birkinshaw (1811‚Äì1867) worked for Robert Stephenson as an Assistant engineer on the London & Birmingham Railway (L&BR;), then Resident Engineer on the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, and was Engineer-in-Chief for the Malton & Driffield Railway (MDR).

Geography This small village is located in the Franconian Heights about 28 km west of Nuremberg, 14 km north east of Ansbach and 38 km east of Rothenburg o.d. Tauber. The river Bibert flows through the valley community and gives its name to the Bibert walking and bicycle path. Apart from the main village, there are 27 subdivisions which also belong to Dietenhofen. These are: { * Adelmannsdorf * Andorf * Dietenholz * Ebersdorf * Frickendorf * G√∂tteldorf * Haunoldshofen * Herpersdorf * H√∂fen * H√∂rleinsdorf * Kehlm√ºnz * Kleinhabersdorf * Kleinhaslach * Lentersdorf  * Leonrod * Methlach * Moosm√ºhle * M√ºnchzell * Neudietenholz * Neudorf * Oberschlauersbach * Rothleiten * R√ºdern * Seubersdorf * Stolzm√ºhle * Walburgswinden * Warzfelden } History The Doodleman‚Äôs Fountain with a half-timbered house in the background It‚Äôs a good idea to start the history of Dietenhofen with the legend behind its name. Many years ago three noble maidens who had got lost in the area were saved by following the sound of a shepherd‚Äôs horn. They were so grateful that they had a chapel built where they met him, and called the place Dudenhofen. This later became ‚ÄúDietenhofen‚Äù. One of the most important monuments in Dietenhofen is the St. Andreas Church, which was built about 1000 AD. The church tower was added in the year 1468. There are some interesting old graves in the church and the magnificent old baroque altar is certainly worth seeing. A few hundred metres away from the church you can find the local history museum which has also played an important role in Dietenhofen‚Äôs history. It was built in 1235 and was surrounded by a moat. It was home to R√ºdiger von Dietenhofen. In 1523 the building was totally destroyed by fire. In 1822 it was rebuilt, bought by the local government and used as the village school. The history would not be complete without mentioning the ruins in Leonrod (a nearby sleepy hamlet). The original building was constructed in 1218 and was also surrounded by a moat. It was home to the Baron of Leonrod and his family until it was accidentally burned down by their own servants in 1651. Dietenhofen is mentioned in History of the Lombards by Paul the Deacon in AD 785, who also calls the place Villa Totonis. Economy Dietenhofen enjoys a healthy economic situation and has as many jobs to offer, as it has inhabitants. The Dietenhofen firms Playmobil/Lechuza (Geobra Brandst√§tter GmbH), Herpa and Branofilter are global players. Political situation The current mayor, Heinz Henninger has been in power since 1984. The local council includes 20 voluntary members. { Dietenhofen has two twin towns:  * Flavignac in France * Zschorlau in Saxony/Germany } Exchanges take place regularly and lasting friendships have been established. Leisure and culture Dietenhofen has a recently renovated indoor swimming pool and a sports hall. There are also some playing fields. The numerous clubs and music groups on offer make sure that there is something for everybody. Cultural events take place regularly.

Background Vigroux's artistic approach integrates new media and performing arts. He is a multifaceted artist whose music works range from electro-acoustic and experimental electronic music to modern composition, improvisation, radio works, avant rock, and beyond. Primarily known as a guitar player, he also manipulates electronics, modular synths and has composed works for contemporary classical ensembles. He is equally prolific as a solo artist and as a collaborator, he has worked with musicians such as Mika Vainio, Reinhold Friedl (Zeitkratzer), Elliott Sharp, Joey Baron, and Zeena Parkins, and regularly collaborates with media artists Antoine Schmitt and Kurt d'Haeseleer. Vigroux founded DAC records in 2002, and the label has released dozens of recordings by himself as well as similarly unclassifiable experimental artists such as H√©l√®ne Breschand, Samuel Sighicelli, Elliott Sharp and Bruno Chevillon. He also established D'Autres Cordes as a performing arts company in 2008, and has presented works by Philippe Malone, Marc Ducret, and others. Vigroux made his solo debut with the Lilas trilogy beginning in 2003, and subsequent efforts such as R√©colte (2009) and We (Nous Autres) increasingly incorporated elements of noise and industrial techno. Additionally, he collaborated with Matthew Bourne on a 2015 Kraftwerk tribute titled Radioland: Radio-Activity Revisited. In 2007, Vigroux worked with Japanese spoken word artist Kenji Siratori on a limited CD-R titled Pituitary Desert; that same year also saw the release of Hums 2 Terre, a live collaboration with Elliott Sharp for Radio France's label Signature. Vigroux's noisy, glitchy solo album R√©colte appeared in 2009, and he also collaborated with Matthew Bourne that year, resulting in the full-length Call Me Madame (Good News from Wonderland). Vigroux released a collaborative 12\\" EP with Jean-Fran√ßois Oliver on the Trig label in 2010. Other releases that year included the electronic solo album Camera Police; Broken Circles Live, an orchestral work performed by Ars Nova Ensemble Instrumental; and Venice, Dal Vivo, a recording of a 2008 live (in Venice, Italy) collaboration with Joey Baron, Bruno Chevillon, and Elliott Sharp. In 2012, Vigroux released Transistor, a collaboration with Michigan-based experimental musician Ben Miller. He also issued another solo album, We (Nous Autres). A second album with Miller, The Din of Eon, appeared in 2013. The following year saw the release of Tobel, Vigroux's collaboration with Reinhold Friedl of contemporary ensemble Zeitkratzer. He also released a solo guitar album titled Ciment, as well as Centaure, a noisy industrial techno-leaning 12\\" EP on Shapednoise's Cosmo Rhythmatic label. Vigroux returned to the label in 2015 for the release of Peau froide, l√©ger soleil, a collaboration with kindred spirit Mika Vainio. He also recorded another collaboration with Bourne, this time a tribute to Kraftwerk's Radio-Aktivit√§t. Radioland: Radio-Activity Revisited appeared at the end of 2015 on Leaf. 2016 saw the release of solo efforts Rapport Sur le D√©sordre and Camera as well as Tobel II with Freidl. Following his solo LP Barricades (2017), Vigroux released Ignis in 2018, a posthumous collaboration with Vainio, who died in 2017. Two solo EPs, D√©sastres and Th√©or√®me, appeared in early 2019 and one LP Totem for Aesthetical.

These weapons were known as \\"cut-down shotguns\\" or \\"messenger's guns\\" from the use of such shotguns on stagecoaches by shotgun messengers in the American Wild West. They came in 10 and 12 gauge blackpowder. Origins The terms \\"cut-down shotgun\\" or \\"messenger's gun\\" were coined in the 1860s when Wells Fargo & Co. assigned shotgun messengers to guard its shipments on stagecoaches in California. The company issued shotguns to its guards for defense. The guard was called a shotgun messenger although the phrase riding shotgun was not coined until 1919. Shotgun messengers guarded express shipments, not stagecoaches. There was no single manufacturer for the traditional messenger's gun, as it was a generic term describing a class of shotguns offered in a variety of barrel lengths from (versus for bird hunting guns), either by the factory or from owners and gunsmiths cutting down the barrels.  Early manufacturers  These shotguns featured external hammers and were manufactured primarily by Remington Arms, Ithaca, Colt's Manufacturing Company, Parker, L.C. Smith, and several Belgian makers. Contrary to myth, Wells Fargo shotguns were not purchased by local agents; prior to 1900 they were purchased from San Francisco gun dealers because Wells Fargo's headquarters were located in San Francisco. From 1908 to 1918 all Wells Fargo shotguns were made by Ithaca.  Use in the Old West  According to one account, Doc Holliday used a 10 gauge Wm. Moore & Co. coach gun to shoot Tom McLaury point-blank in the chest with buckshot during the Gunfight at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, on Wednesday, October 26, 1881. They stood in such close proximity that the town mortician was able to cover McLaury's wound with one hand. Wyatt Earp also used both barrels of a 10 gauge coach gun to kill Frank Stilwell at a Tucson, Arizona rail yard and to kill \\"Curly\\" Bill Brocius point-blank the next year during the shootout at Iron Springs. However, according to another account, both men used Greeners.  Modern makers  Modern coach guns are manufactured by ER Amantino (sold as Stoeger) (Brazil), IZH/Baikal (Russia) (which is now being distributed by Remington under the name Spartan Gunworks), Huglu Armsco (Turkey), Khan (Turkey), Diamond (Turkey), and a variety of Chinese companies for US distribution through Century International Arms and Interstate Armscorp.  Current usage  Modern coach guns are commonly encountered in Cowboy Action Shooting competitions, among collections of Western guns, as home-defense weapons, and even as \\"scrub guns\\" for hunting grouse, woodcock, rabbit, hare, and/or wild pig in scrub, bush or marshlands, where the 24\\"+ barrels of a traditional shotgun would prove unwieldy. The modern coach gun can be had in a variety of configurations suitable for both Cowboy Action Shooting competition and hunting. Coach guns are similar to sawn-off shotguns but differ in that coach guns manufactured after 1898 are offered as new with 18\\" barrels and 26\\" overall length and meet legal requirements for civilian possession in the United States. Australia and New Zealand have slightly different laws for length, with NZ requiring a minimum overall length of 30\\" (anything shorter is considered a pistol) with no minimum barrel length and Australia requiring an 18\\" barrel and a 30\\" overall length. In the United Kingdom, however, shotguns must have a minimum barrel length of 24\\" to be eligible for ownership on a Shotgun Certificate, and shotguns with barrels under this length (which includes Coach guns) must be obtained on the more stringent Firearms Certificate. Some modern coach guns feature internal hammers as opposed to the traditional external hammers.  Legacy  It is because of this gun and its usage that the term \\"Riding shotgun\\" came to be. Typically, a cut-down shotgun would be carried by the messenger sitting next to the stagecoach driver, ready to use the gun to ward off bandits. Today, in American and Canadian English, the term \\"Riding shotgun\\" refers to the person sitting in the front passenger seat of an automobile.

Quote from Pg 125: \\"and finally of Mazyar, a local chieftain of Tabaristan, against whom the caliph sent the Turkish general Afshin, the conqueror of Babak\\" He came from an Iranian cultural region and was not usually considered Turkish. The confusion comes from the fact that the term ‚ÄúTurk‚Äù was used loosely by Arab writers of the time to denote the new troops of the caliph despite the inclusion among them of some elements of Iranian origin, including Ferghana and Oshrusana.M.A. Shaban, ‚ÄúIslamic History‚Äù, Cambridge University Press, v.2 1978. Page 63:\\"These new troops were the so-called ‚ÄúTurks‚Äù. It must be said without hesitation that this is the most misleading misnomer which has led some scholars to harp ad nauseam on utterly unfounded interpretation of the following era, during which they unreasonably ascribe all events to Turkish domination. In fact the great majority of these troops were not Turks. It has been frequently pointed out that Arabic sources use the term Turk in a very loose manner. The Hephthalites are referred to as Turks, so are the peoples of Gurgan, Khwarizm and Sistan. Indeed, with the exception of the Soghdians, Arabic sources refer to all peoples not subjects of the Sassanian empire as Turks. In Samarra separate quarters were provided for new recruits from every locality. The group from Farghana were called after their district, and the name continued in usage because it was easy to pronounce. But such groups as the Ishtakhanjiyya, the Isbijabbiya and groups from similar localities who were in small numbers at first, were lumped together under the general term Turks, because of the obvious difficulties the Arabs had in pronouncing such foreign names. The Khazars who also came from small localities which could not even be identified, as they were mostly nomads, were perhaps the only group that deserved to be called Turks on the ground of racial affinity. However, other groups from Transcaucasia were classed together with the Khazars under the general description.\\" ªUthmƒÅn Sayyid A·∏•mad IsmƒÅ ªƒ´l Bƒ´lƒ´, \\"Prelude to the Generals\\", Published by Garnet & Ithaca Press, 2001. pg 47:\\"The name Turk was given to all these troops, despite the inclusion amongst them of some elements of Iranian origin, Ferghana, Ushrusana, and Shash ‚Äì places were in fact the centers were the slave material was collected together....Judging from the specific names of their origin, Soghd, Farghana, Urshusuna, Shahs, the majority of them might have been of Iranian origin\\" His background has been stated to be Sogdian (an Eastern Iranian people).  Early years  According to Yaqubi, during the reign of the third Abbasid caliph Al-Mahdi (775-85), Afshin of Oshrusana was mentioned among several Iranian and Turkish rulers of Transoxania and the Central Asian steppes who submitted nominally to him. But it was not until Harun al-Rashid's reign in 794-95 that al-Fadl ibn Yahya al- Barmaki led an expedition into Transoxania and received the submission of Afshin KharƒÅkana, the ruling Akin.whose name, by inference from Tabari, III, p. 1066, was something like KharƒÅkana; according to Gardƒ´zƒ´ led. Habibi, p. 130 Further expeditions were sent to Oshrusana by Al-Ma'mun when he was governor in Merv and later after he had become caliph. Kawus ibn Kharakhuruh, the son of the Afshin KarƒÅkana, withdrew his allegiance from the Arabs. However, shortly after Ma'mun arrived in Baghdad from the east (817-18 or 819-20), a power struggle and dissension broke out among the reigning family of Oshrusana. According to most of the sources, al-Ma'mun's heir, Al-Mu'tasim seconded high-ranking officers to serve under him and ordered exceptionally large salaries, expense allowances, and rations for him.Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"Babak Khorrami\\" by G.H. Yusofi In 831-833, Afshin suppressed uprisings throughout Egypt. On 2 June 832 Afshin succeeded in taking Bima in Egypt. The town surrendered to Afshin following his advice that al-Ma'mun promised safe conduct. Afshin and Babak Babak parleys with the Afshin Haydar, the Caliph al-Mu'tasim's general In 835, Caliph al-Mu'tasim appointed Afshin as governor of Adharbayjan to fight against Babak Khorramdin, leader of anti- Islamic neo-Mazdakite Persian movement of the Khurramites. After a fierce resistance by Babak's army, Afshin eventually defeated it and captured Babak's castle of Bazz in August 837. Ya'qubi (Tarikh II, 579) records Afshin freeing 7,600 Arab prisoners from this fortress and he destroyed the castle. The Khurramite leader went into hiding under the protection of a local Christian prince Sahl ibn-Sunbat who later turned him into Afshin. In return for Afshin's achievements, the caliph rewarded him with the governorship of Sind in addition to that of Armenia and Adharbayjan.  Amorium campaign  Map of the Byzantine and Arab campaigns in the years 837‚Äì838, showing Theophilos's raid into Upper Mesopotamia and Mu'tasim's retaliatory invasion of Asia Minor (Anatolia), culminating in the conquest of Amorium. In 838, al-Mu'tasim decided to launch a major punitive expedition against Byzantium, aiming to capture the two major Byzantine cities of central Asia Minor, Ancyra and Amorium. The latter was probably the largest city in Asia Minor at the time, as well as the birthplace of the reigning Amorian dynasty and consequently of particular symbolic importance; according to the chronicles, al-Mu'tasim's soldiers painted the word \\"Amorium\\" on their shields and banners. A vast army was gathered at Tarsus (80,000 men according to Treadgold), which was then divided into two main forces. Afshin was placed in command of the northern force, that would invade the Armeniac theme from the region of Melitene, joining up with the forces of the city's emir, Omar al-Aqta. The southern, main force, under the Caliph himself, would pass through the Cilician Gates into Cappadocia and head to Ancyra. After the city was taken, the Arab armies would join and march to Amorium. Afshin's force included, according to Skylitzes, the entire Arab army of Armenia, and numbered 20,000 (Haldon) to 30,000 men (Treadgold), among whom were some 10,000 Turkish horse-archers. In mid-June 838, Afshin crossed the Anti-Taurus Mountains and encamped at the fort of Dazimon, between Amaseia and Tokate, a strategically important location which the Byzantines also used as a forward staging area. A few days later, on 19 June, the vanguard of the main Abbasid army also invaded Byzantine territory, followed two days after by the Caliph with the main body. Emperor Theophilos chose to confront Afshin first, since although his army was smaller, it threatened to cut off his supply lines. On 21 July, the imperial army came into view of the Arab force, and encamped on the hill of Anzen south of Dazimon. In the ensuing Battle of Anzen, the Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress, but noon Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. At the same time, Theophilos decided to lead reinforcements to one of his wings, and his sudden absence disquieted his troops, thinking he had been killed. The Byzantine army collapsed, with some units breaking and fleeing disorderly, while others were apparently able to retreat in good order. Theophilos himself barely escaped the battle with his guard, and was surrounded by Afshin's men on a low hill. Afshin sent for catapults to be brought up to batter the Byzantine position, but the Byzantines managed to break through the Arab lines and the Emperor escaped. The caliph's vanguard under Ashinas reached Ancyra, which had been abandoned by its inhabitants, on 26 July. Afshin arrived there a few days later, and united with the main Abbasid army, which now turned south towards Amorium. Afshin commanded the rear guard, while Ashinas was once again in front, and the caliph in the middle. Looting the countryside as they advanced, they arrived before Amorium seven days after their departure from Ancyra, and began their siege of the city on 1 August. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes manuscript depicting the Arab siege of Amorium The city's fortifications were strong, with a wide moat and a thick wall protected by 44 towers, according to the contemporary geographer Ibn Khordadbeh, and the caliph assigned each of his generals to a stretch of the walls. Both besiegers and besieged had many siege engines, and for three days both sides exchanged missile fire while Arab sappers tried to undermine the walls. According to Arab accounts, an Arab prisoner who had converted to Christianity defected back to the caliph, and informed him about a place in the wall which had been badly damaged by heavy rainfall and only hastily and superficially repaired due to the city commander's negligence. As a result, the Arabs concentrated their efforts on this section. The defenders tried to protect the wall by hanging wooden beams to absorb the shock, but they splintered, and after two days a breach was made. The Arabs now launched repeated attacks on the breach, with Afshin, Ashinas, and Itakh taking turns in leading their men in attack, but the defenders held firm. In the event, the city fell by treachery in mid- August, when the Byzantine officer commanding the breach tried to open up separate negotiations with al-Mu'tasim, and the Abbasids used the lull in order to launch a surprise attack.  Downfall  Despite his successes, Afshin's star began to decline, apparently as a result of his jealousy towards \`Abdallah bin Taher, the governor of Khorasan who Afshin apparently regarded as an upstart and a rival for power in Transoxania. Afshin had begun intriguing with Mazyar, a Karenid prince and ispahbadh of Tabaristan in the Caspian region. Afshin allegedly encouraged Mazyar in secret, in the hope that \`AbdallƒÅh bin TƒÅher would be deprived of his governorship allowing Af≈°ƒ´n to take over the governorship. Mazyar's rebellion was quashed in 839 and Afshin's position became increasingly difficult, which caused Afshin to fall from favour. His situation was made worse by the finding of correspondence between him and Mazyar. Further, the Khurasanian governor, Abdallah ibn Tahir, alleged that he had intercepted some of Babak's wealth Afshin had obtained in the earlier campaign and was seeking to transfer secretly to Afshin's lands in Oshrusana. When Mazyar arrived in Samarra, Afshin was arrested. Mazyar participated in the interrogation of the former general, asserting that Afshin had conspired with him. Others present raised additional questions concerning the sincerity of Afshin's conversion to Islam from Zoroastrianism. He said There is no God but God! to Al Wathiq. Afshin had answers to all the allegations. He claimed that Zoroastrian artefacts and books in his possession were family heirlooms from before he had become Muslim. He explained that when he punished a pair of Muslim fanatics destroying idols in Ushrusanah he was exercising reasonable leadership aimed at maintaining the harmony of his religiously diverse territory. He told his detractors that the formulaic address his people used in writing to him in Persian as \\"lord of lords\\", was simply a tradition and did not invalidate his personal belief in one God.Tabari v. 33, p. 187f. All such replies were unsuccessful. Al-Mu'tasim had a special prison built for Afshin. It was known as \\"The Pearl\\" and was in the shape of a minaret. There he spent the final nine months of his life and there he died in May‚ÄìJune 841. The Tigris river was used as a dumping ground for his cremated remains. A single location was used for the crucifixion of Afshin, Maziyar, and Babak's corpses. After his death Ustrushana was Islamified whereas before he preserved temples from ruin.

The library has been housed in a number of buildings since its founding. History of the two Carnegie library buildings and the observatory Dr Reid's refractor telescope in Airdrie Public Observatory Roof dome site of original observatory on Anderson Street New Rooftop Dome of Airdrie Public Observatory Refurbished Cooke of York telescope in Airdrie Public Observatory The history of the library dates back to the 1850s when the town adopted the Public Libraries Act. Its first home was a room in the town hall, or Town House as it was called. From 1860 it moved a number of times until the opening of its current home in 1925. There have been two buildings purpose built for the library. The first was opened in 1894 by a public subscription of more than ¬£1000 and a ¬£1000 donation from Andrew Carnegie (the Scottish-American philanthropist) on Anderson Street, today‚Äôs Airdrie Arts Centre. MP Sir John Wilson gave a further ¬£1000 to write off accompanying debt. Unusually, the library has shared a common history with an observatory. Airdrie Public Observatory was founded in this building in 1896. The 1894 building proved too small. The second purpose-built, and current, building was designed by JM Arthur, and opened on 25 September 1925, funded by Airdrie Savings Bank and a second Carnegie grant.By this time Carnegie had died but his philanthropic work was continued by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. The local newspaper, the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser had this to say the next day; \\"Although not quite finished the new Library building in Wellwynde Street was sufficiently far advanced towards completion to allow the opening ceremony to take place yesterday afternoon\\". The observatory moved along with the library, a purpose-built observatory being built on the library roof and a brass refracting telescope was obtained by the observatory curator Ex-Baillie James Lewis for the sum of ¬£500. The original Dr Reid telescope was also brought from the old observatory.  Covenanters' flag  In 1920, the library was gifted a Covenanters' flag, carried in the Battle of Bothwell Bridge, by John Main, Laird of Ballochney. The flag suffered degradation due to light exposure, but underwent restoration, completed in 2002, and was re-displayed. Chronology=1853 In August the Public Libraries Act (Scotland) was passed, and in November Airdrie was the first Scottish town to adopt it, beating Dunfermline into second place by 13 years. 1856 A quantity of books were obtained for the sum of ¬£40 from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Library opened in the clerks office in the Town House, now known as the Town Clock. 1892 Andrew Carnegie had promised in a letter to Mr Thomas Jeffrey of Airdrie Savings Bank an amount of money equaling ¬£1,000 (being half of the money required to build a new library) so long as a piece of land was acquired and the other half of the money was raised locally. On receiving this guarantee, a public appeal was launched on 13 June 1892 for funds, and by October 1892 more than ¬£1,000 had been raised. With more than ¬£2,000, plans were drawn up to build the new Library on Anderson Street. 1894 The new library was opened and MP Sir John Wilson wrote off some accompanying debt to the amount of ¬£1,000 which allowed the new library to operate debt free from then on. 189628 April Airdrie Public Observatory= Dr. Thomas Reid, an eminent Glasgow oculist, donated a brass- bodied, refracting telescope to the town, and it was housed in the library. He also donated the sum of ¬£35 to convert a top-floor room, where a dome was built on the roof of the building for it. Thus founding Airdrie Public Observatory. Robert Dunlop was the first Honorary Curator, followed shortly by Mr Peter Scotland. 192525 September= A new library was built near the first purpose built library with financial assistance from Airdrie Savings Bank and a second grant from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.

ROMI is not like the other 'return-on- investment' (ROI) metrics because marketing is not the same kind of investment. Instead of money that is 'tied' up in plants and inventories (often considered capital expenditure or CAPEX), marketing funds are typically 'risked'. Marketing spending is typically expensed in the current period (operational expenditure or OPEX). The idea of measuring the market's response in terms of sales and profits is not new, but terms such as marketing ROI and ROMI are used more frequently now than in past periods. Usually, marketing spending will be deemed as justified if the ROMI is positive. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, nearly half responded that they found the ROMI metric very useful.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. The purpose of ROMI is to measure the degree to which spending on marketing contributes to profits. Marketers are under more and more pressure to \\"show a return\\" on their activities. History The ROMI concept first came to prominence in the 1990s. The phrase \\"return on marketing investment\\" became more widespread in the next decade following the publication of two books Return on Marketing Investment by Guy Powell (2002) Powell, Guy R., Return on Marketing Investment: Demand More From Your Marketing And Sales Investments (2003) RPI Press. and Marketing ROI by James Lenskold (2003).Lenskold, James, Marketing ROI: The Path to Campaign, Customer, and Corporate Profitability (2003) McGraw-Hill In the book \\"What Sticks: Why Advertising Fails And How To Guarantee Yours Succeeds,\\" Rex Briggs suggested the term \\"ROMO\\" for Return-On-Marketing-Objective, to reflect the idea that marketing campaigns may have a range of objectives, where the return is not immediate sales or profits. For example, a marketing campaign may aim to change the perception of a brand.2006 What Sticks, Kaplan  Construction  :Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) = :[Incremental Revenue Attributable to Marketing ($) * Contribution Margin (%) - Marketing Spending ($)] / :Marketing Spending ($) A necessary step in calculating ROMI is the measurement and eventual estimation of the incremental sales attributed to marketing. These incremental sales can be 'total' sales attributable to marketing or 'marginal.' Methodologies There are two forms of the Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) metric. Short term The first, short-term ROMI, is also used as a simple index measuring the dollars of revenue (or market share, contribution margin or other desired outputs) for every dollar of marketing spent. For example, if a company spends $100,000 on a direct mail piece and it delivers $500,000 in incremental revenue, then the ROMI factor is 5.0. If the incremental contribution margin for that $500,000 in revenue is 60%, then the margin ROMI (the incremental margin for $100,000 of marketing spent) is $300,000 (= $500,000 x 60%). Of which, the $100,000 spent on direct mail advertising will be subtracted and the difference will be divided by the same $100,000. Every dollar expended in direct mail advertising translates to an additional $2 on the company's bottom line. The value of the first ROMI is in its simplicity. In most cases a simple determination of revenue per dollar spent for each marketing activity can be sufficient to help make important decisions to improve the entire marketing mix. The most common short term approach to measuring ROMI is by applying Marketing Mix Modeling techniques to separate out the incremental sales effects of marketing investment. Long term In a similar way the second ROMI concept, long-term ROMI can be used to determine other less tangible aspects of marketing effectiveness. For example, ROMI could be used to determine the incremental value of marketing as it pertains to increased brand awareness, consideration or purchase intent. In this way both the longer-term value of marketing activities (incremental brand awareness, etc.) and the shorter-term revenue and profit can be determined. This is a sophisticated metric that balances marketing and business analytics and is used increasingly by many of the world's leading organizations (Hewlett-Packard and Procter & Gamble to name two) to measure the economic (that is, cash-flow derived) benefits created by marketing investments. For many other organizations, this method offers a way to prioritize investments and allocate marketing and other resources on a formalized basis. Long term ROMI models will often draw on Customer lifetime value models to demonstrate the long term value of incremental customer acquisition or reduced churn rate. Some more sophisticated Marketing Mix Modeling approaches include multi-year long term ROMI by including CLV type analysis. CLV has been used as input to ROMI calculations in some academic works. Long term ROMI models have sometimes used brand valuation techniques to measure how building a brand with marketing spend can create balance sheet value for brands (or at least for brands that have been transacted, and therefore under accounting rules can have a balance sheet value). The ISO 10668 standard sets out the appropriate process of valuing brands and sets out six key requirements, transparency, validity, reliability, sufficiency, objectivity and financial, behavioural and legal parameters. Brand valuation is distinguished from brand equity by placing a money value on a brand, and in this way a ROMI can be calculated. Note: No return on marketing investment methodologies have been independently audited by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) according to MMAP (Marketing Metric Audit Protocol) . Cautions Direct measures of the short- term variant of ROMI are often criticized as only including the direct impact of marketing activities without including the long-term brand building value of any communication inserted into the market. Short-term ROMI is best employed as a tool to determine marketing effectiveness to help steer investments from less productive activities to those that are more productive. It is a simple tool to gauge the success of measurable marketing activities against various marketing objectives (e.g., incremental revenue, brand awareness or brand equity). With this knowledge, marketing investments can be redirected away from under-performing activities to better performing marketing media. Long-term ROMI is often criticized as a \\"silo-in-the- making\\"‚Äîit is intensively data driven and creates a challenge for firms that are not used to working business analytics into the marketing analytics that typically determine resource allocation decisions. Long-term ROMI, however, is a sophisticated measure used by a number of firms interested in getting to the bottom of value for money challenges often posed by competing brand managers. However, it is often unclear exactly what it means to 'show a return' on marketing investment. \\"Certainly, marketing spending is not an 'investment' in the usual sense of the word. There is usually no tangible asset and often not even a predictable (quantifiable) result to show for the spending, but marketers still want to emphasize that their activities contribute to financial health. Some might argue that marketing should be considered an expense and the focus should be on whether it is a necessary expense. Marketers believe that many of their activities generate lasting results and therefore should be considered 'investments' in the future of the business.\\" Hawkins, Del I., Roger J. Best, and Charles M. Lillis. (1987). ‚ÄúThe Nature and Measurement of Marketing Productivity in Consumer Durables Industries: A Firm Level Analysis,‚Äù Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 1(4), 1‚Äì8. ROMI across mediums The difficulty of measuring ROMI varies across mediums. Results of a recent North American survey show the ROI associated with one-way, traditional media (e.g. television and radio) is more difficult to measure than interactive, web-based digital media such as permission-based email marketing or social media marketing. In 2013, Black Ink introduced Eye On, the first SaaS designed to measure enterprise ROMI across all mediums. With the rise in Digital Marketing, the opportunity is available for marketers, or even business owners to run rough calculations of what their approximate ROI may be for their campaigns, before they even start investing. Based from statistical research, and all things being equal, the business owner can calculate their current Digital Marketing ROI via their website and web analytics software to understand their : * Current Traffic * Conversion Rate and * Average Sale. Add in readily available information on potential traffic from the Google Keyword Tool, and surveyed costs to acquire that traffic, the business owner or marketer can estimate the potential ROI if that traffic is acquired, and even measure it against other marketing methods.

Among those he won over were the king of Fir Rois and Saint Adomn√°n.

The hostages taken in the raid were later returned through the offices of Adomn√°n in 687.Annals of Ulster AU 685.2; AU 687.5 According to the saga B√≥roma (\\"The Cattle Tribute\\"), it is mentioned that F√≠nsnechta Fledach undertook an expedition against Leinster when the Laigin refused to pay the cattle tribute. The Leinster king Bran Mut mac Conaill (died 693) assembled the Leinster forces and sent Saint Moling (d. 697), the abbot of Ferns, to negotiate with F√≠nsnechta. Mo-Ling tricked F√≠nsnechta into remitting the tribute. As a result, Saint Adomnan grew angry with the high king and cursed saying that his descendants would have no fame. F√≠nsnechta did penance to Adomnan and was forgiven for remitting the Boruma. B√≥roma at Dan Wiley's site on the Cycles of the Kings Temporary Abdication and Death In 688, F√≠nsnechta abdicated to become a monk, but he left the clerical life and resumed the kingship in 689. This return to power may have been a result of the break-out of a civil war among the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine when Niall mac Cernaig Sotal (died 701) of the U√≠ Chernaig sept of south Brega defeated Congalach mac Conaing Cuirre (died 696) of north Brega at the Battle of Imlech Pich in 688.

According to the Annals of Tigernach, this occurred in battle, but the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland state that Finsnechta was murdered in a tent by Congalach.Annals of Tigernach AT 695.1; Fragmentary Annals, FA 124 Congalach succeeded F√≠nsnechta as King of Brega, and Loingsech mac √ìengusso, of the northern Cen√©l Conaill branch of the U√≠ N√©ill, was the next High King.

Some internet sites list his birthyear as 1841 Biography He was born on the Greek Island of Corfu, the son of Dr Mark Rossi, an Italian who was one of the three judges presiding over the Ionian Islands during the time of British rule. On a visit to Preston, England in 1866, Rossi met and later married Jane Gillow. He remained in the United Kingdom thereafter. In the 1870s he moved to London. Between 1871 and 1903, Rossi exhibited 66 works at the Royal Academy and was also a member of the Hogarth Club. Many of his paintings were of children and young adults, the models often being members of his own family. Perhaps his most well-known painting is Forbidden Books (1897).Forbidden books (\\"Eras of Elegance\\"). After his first wife's death, he married Silvia Tassart in 1902. He died in Golders Green, London on 9 January 1916.

Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court which rejected a challenge from the state of South Carolina to the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which required that some states submit changes in election districts to the Attorney General of the United States (at the time, Nicholas Katzenbach). The preclearance provisions were ruled constitutional and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enforced in full.. Background The Voting Rights Act required states to make adjustments to their voting and registration systems if the state employed a literacy test and if the voter turnout or registration was less than fifty percent by November 1, 1964. This was known as the preclearance requirement and affected mostly southern states, making them seek approval from the U.S. District Court for any changes to their voter registration and voting system. In South Carolina, the state attorney general, Daniel R. McLeod filed a complaint directly with the Supreme Court attacking the constitutionality of the act and asking for an injunction against enforcement by the attorney general of the United States, Nicholas Katzenbach. McLeod challenged the Voting Rights Act as an unconstitutional encroachment on states‚Äô rights, as a violation of equality between the states, and as an illegal bill of attainder which is legislative punishment enforced without due process of law. South Carolina was joined on its attack on the Voting Rights Act by other southern states. Meanwhile, the twenty states that filed in support of the act's provisions and powers mainly consisted of northern and western states. While other states did not file suit, many southern states supported South Carolina's actions. The case took on an even wider significance than normal state challenges to a new federal law because it dealt with both state sovereignty and the power of the legislative branch. The decision represents a rare instance of the Supreme Court exercising its right of original jurisdiction, as the case was filed directly in the Supreme Court by the state of South Carolina, rather than being appealed from a lower court. The court intentionally heard the case prior to June of 1966 so their decision would be in effect for South Carolina's primary elections that year. The Opinion of the Court In his opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that the Voting Rights Act was a valid exercise of Congress' power under the enforcement clause of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Warren cited the enforcement clause of the 15th Amendment which gave Congress full powers to stop discrimination in regards to voting. He also stated that the Voting Rights Act was necessary to remedy the evil of racism.Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 327-28. Additionally, the historical record showed that the 15th Amendment was not strong enough on its own since voter discrimination had continued despite the amendment. The Voting Rights Act provided sterner and more enforceable measures to ensure equal voting opportunities to all citizens. The only dissent in the ruling came from Justice Hugo L. Black who opposed the legislation because he felt it exceeded the textual reach of the constitution. In his dissent, he explained, ‚ÄúThere is no reason to read into the Constitution meanings it did not have when it was adopted and which have not been put into place.‚Äù While he would have sustained most of the law, he would have struck down the Section 5 preclearance provisions. > Section 5, by providing that some of the States cannot pass state laws or > adopt state constitutional amendments without first being compelled to beg > federal authorities to approve their policies, so distorts our > constitutional structure of government as to render any distinction drawn in > the Constitution between state and federal power almost meaningless. One of > the most basic premises upon which our structure of government was founded > was that the Federal Government was to have certain specific and limited > powers and no others, and all other power was to be reserved either 'to the > States respectively, or to the people.' Certainly if all the provisions of > our Constitution which limit the power of the Federal Government and reserve > other power to the States are to mean anything, they mean at least that the > States have power to pass laws and amend their constitutions without first > sending their officials hundreds of miles away to beg federal authorities to > approve them.Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 358-59 (Black, J., dissenting in part).  Impact  Through the court's majority decision, the Voting Rights Act was upheld and able to be implemented without any barriers. This allowed for over 800,000 African Americans to register to vote between 1964 and 1967. This case was also used as a precedent in other judicial challenges to the Voting Rights Act. According to Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor Luis Fuentes-Rohwer, the case served as an example of a firm interpretation of the 15th Amendment, which granted Congress \\"full remedial powers\\" to prevent any racial discrimination. Fuentes-Roher also stated that the case was also an example of the Supreme Court giving more power to Congress by allowing them to create legislation on a topic usually reserved for the States. Opponents of the ruling cite this as an example of judicial activism on steroids, implying this was an overreach of the Supreme Court's powers. They argue the case was decided by the judges' personal beliefs and motives instead of the law and judicial precedent. This ruling was a massive win for the Civil Rights Movement, allowing for over 800,000 African Americans to register to vote between 1964 and 1967.Davidson, Chandler; Grofman, Bernard (1996-10-01). \\"Quiet Revolution in the South: the Impact of the Voting Rights Act, 1965-1990 [Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia]\\".

He was the first Irish person to ride the Tour de France, first to win a stage, and first to wear the yellow jersey, and first English speaker to win stages in all the Grand Tours. After a strong amateur period, primarily with the Dublin Wheelers, Elliott was the first Irish cyclist to make a mark as a professional rider in continental Europe. A late-starting but naturally talented rider, he spent most of his pro career riding as a domestique for team leaders such as Jacques Anquetil, and Anquetil's deputy Jean Stablinski. He came 2nd (to Stablinski) in the 1962 World Road Championship at Sal√≤, Italy. Aside from being the first English- speaker to lead the Tour de France, wearing the yellow jersey for three days, Elliott was first English-speaker to lead the Vuelta a Espa√±a, in which he came third in 1962 and was the only English-speaker to win the Omloop \\"Het Volk\\" semi-classic until 2014 when Ian Stannard won the race. Hood, Ed (cycling manager and historian), Velo Veritas - The Shay Elliott Memorial, 2005, section \\"Shay Elliott was a hero\\", checked 2018-09-02 He died in unclear circumstances at the age of 36. Life=Early life Elliott was from the working class area of Crumlin in Dublin, the eldest son of James Elliott, a motorbike mechanic, and Ellen, always known as Nell. He played Gaelic football and hurling and didn't learn to ride a bicycle until he was 14. He used it to ride to the town of Naas.O'Riordan Ian, The Irish Times, Sat 25 July 2009, Sport, \\"No second act, just tragedy, for Shay Elliott\\" Amateur career He joined a small cycling club, St Brendan's, attached to St Brendan's Catholic Church, Coolock, when he was 16 and took part in races of about 20 miles that the church organised around the city streets. He came second in his first race, riding a \\"scrap\\" bike with a single fixed wheel that led his pedals to bang the road on corners. The winner had a specialised racing bike. Elliott joined the Southern Road Club when he was 17 and, on a racing bike, won the Grand Prix of Ireland run over 50 km in the Phoenix Park. The club broke up soon afterwards and Elliott joined the Dublin Wheelers, one of the most active clubs at that time, in March 1952. That summer he won the Mannin Veg, a race over one lap of the TT motorcycling circuit on the Isle of Man. He also won the Dublin-Galway-Dublin two-day race, winning the race back to Dublin in a sprint. In 1953 he rode the Manx International, over three laps of the TT circuit, for the Ireland \\"B\\" team. He fell on the tricky turn at Governor's Bridge, shortly before the finish, but came fourth. He won the 1953 Irish amateur road championship. His King of the Mountains placing in the Tour of Ireland in 1954 earned him a trip to the Simplex training camp in Monte Carlo the following spring. Jock Wadley said of him in Sporting Cyclist: > I can not remember all the items in Shay's luggage, of course. But I can > hardly forget that one whole compartment in the chest of drawers was devoted > to provisions which Shay had brought from Ireland, the chief stock being 2lb > [1kg] of tea and 2lb of chocolate creams. I was invited to eat as many of > the chocolates as I liked, because his aunt who worked in the place where > they were made would soon be sending more. He said that Elliott was one of several riders asked to strip for examination by the soigneur Raymond Le Bert, who normally worked for Louison Bobet. Wadley wrote: > It would be wrong to say that the company laughed when Shay stood there in > his underpants, but there were certainly some smiles because in contrast to > his lithe, clean-limbed predecessors at the examination, Shay looked a > short, fat boy. Le Bert, however, did not smile. Immediately he exclaimed: > 'Ah ha, now this is really rock. He is a real flahute. (Flahute is a > favourite French way of describing the old-type tough Flemish roadman.) Elliott did not return permanently to Ireland at the end of the training camp in early 1955. He had just finished six years as an apprentice sheet-metal worker and he and his family in Old County Road in Crumlin, had decided that he had mastered panel-beating and would have a trade to return to if his efforts to become a professional cyclist failed. He contacted a former French professional, Francis P√©lissier, for advice. P√©lissier told Elliott to compete in as many races as possible, at least three or four a week ‚Äì possibly in France, but not in Ireland, a cycling backwater. Elliott planned to move to Ghent in Belgium, where he could race several times a week and, as an amateur, win money denied to him in Ireland. At the training camp, however, he met the journalist and race organiser Jean Leulliot, who told him he would burn himself out in round-the-houses racing and urged him to move to Paris. Leulliot remembered how Elliott had won the Tourmalet stage of the 1954 Route de France, which Leulliot's paper, Route et Piste, organised. Leulliot asked in his paper for someone to accommodate Elliott in the capital and added \\"The Irishman is soaked with class and has a great future before him.\\" The appeal was answered by Paul Wiegant of the Athletic Club Boulogne-Billancourt (ACBB) in Paris, France's top amateur team. Elliott won five one-day amateur classics in 1955 and set the world 10 km amateur record on the V√©lodrome d'Hiver in Paris. He was the first foreigner to be ranked top amateur in France. Elliott turned professional for the 1956 season. Professional career Elliott in 1963 Elliott signed as a professional for the Helyett-F√©lix Potin team (Helyett was a bicycle manufacturere). He won his first race, the GP d'Echo Alger in Algeria, outsprinting Andr√© Darrigade. He also won the GP Catox and the GP Isbergues. In his first major race of 1957, the Omloop \\"Het Volk\\" in Belgium, he made a race-long break with Englishman Brian Robinson. The break was caught near the finish but Elliott's form was noted. He won the Circuit de la Vienne. He became a team-mate of Jacques Anquetil and Jean Stablinski, staying with the team under different sponsors for much of his career. In 1959 he won Omloop \\"Het Volk\\", the first foreigner to do so. He attacked on the Mur de Grammont with 30 km to ride and dropped all his rivals except Fred De Bruyne, the Belgian hope. The pair raced together to the finish where Elliott won easily. That season Elliott rode the Tour de France, then run for national teams, in a mixed team that included the Englishman, Brian Robinson. Robinson rode above his level across the Massif Central and next day paid the price; he trailed far behind the field. William Fotheringham wrote: > In hot weather, these are some of the toughest roads in France, constantly > rising and falling. Elliott remained with Robinson, chivvying him, pacing > him, pouring water on his head as the Tour's doctor, Pierre Dumas > administered glucose tablets. It was the kind of heroic spectacle the Tour > reporters loved. Robinson en perdition ran the next day's headline in > L'√âquipe, which described Elliott's efforts as \\"attentions de m√®re poule\\" ‚Äì > the solicitousness of a mother hen.Fotheringham, William (2005), Roule > Britannia, Yellow Jersey, UK Both finished outside the day's race elimination time limit, and expected to be sent home. However, the team's manager, Sauveur Ducazeaux, insisted the judges apply a rule that no rider in the first ten could be eliminated. Robinson had started the day ninth: it was Elliott who was sent home. \\"The mother hen was cooked; the chick avoided the pot\\", Fotheringham said. Robinson always regretted the outcome, and when he won the next stage, told journalists that he did it for Elliott. In 1960, Elliott became the first English-speaking rider to take the pink jersey in the Giro d'Italia. In 1962, he came third in the 1962 Vuelta a Espa√±a, coming second in the points classification, and winning the fourth stage; he led the race for nine days. In the 1962 world road championship at Sal√≤ in Italy, he got into the winning break with Stablinski. Stablinski was a team-mate in the professional peloton and a friend but a rival in the championship, where riders rode in national teams. However, Elliott and Stablinski worked to wear down the other break members. When Stablinski attacked, Elliott refused to chase and the Frenchman won alone. Elliott eventually broke away to take the silver medal. Elliott admitted he had sacrificed his chance for Stablinski's benefit. \\"Team loyalty was a theme that ran throughout Elliott's career,\\" noted the editor of Cycling Martin Ayres. Elliott said: \\"I'm not supposed to say that I helped Jean, but he's the best friend I've got in cycling and godfather to my son, Pascal. So I couldn't very well go after him, could I?\\"An article about Seamus Elliott profile, CyclingRevealed.com; accessed 19 April 2015. His best result was in the 1963 Tour de France. He won by 33 seconds, enough to give him the yellow jersey of leadership. He held it for three days. Another 20 years passed before another Irishman, Sean Kelly, led the Tour. This achievement also made him the first English-speaker to lead the three great European tours, of Italy, Spain and France. Elliott spent his career as a domestique, a rider who sacrifices his chances for his leader, but with the right to sprint for wins. He made a career from appearance contracts and start money, riding criteriums in Belgium ‚Äì the races that Leulliot said would burn him out ‚Äì and races in Britain, including a meeting at the velodrome at Herne Hill in London where the star attraction was the Italian, Fausto Coppi. Elliott also rode and won the professional race on the Isle of Man, the Manx Premier. =Controversies= Elliott was contracted to ride London-Holyhead in 1965, at 275 miles the longest single-day race in the world not to use pacers.Bordeaux‚ÄìParis was longer but the second half was ridden behind derny motorcycles. Tom Simpson won, beating Elliott and a domestic professional, Albert Hitchen. Controversy started the moment that Cycling printed a picture of the sprint. Elliott had his hands tugging his brakes before the line. The magazine suggested he was braking to avoid the crowd further down the road, but many thought it a fix. Another rider in the race, Pete Ryalls, said in Procycling in 2008: > The fix was for Barry Hoban to win. Barry was touch and go whether he'd get > another contract because he'd done sweet FA all season. And it all went > wrong because he didn't have the form anyway and it's a bloody long way if > you don't have the legs. And the thing that messed it up was that going > across Anglesey a big tall lanky guy called Peter Gordon. He pushed off and > caused all sorts of consternation and the only people who could get across > to him were Simpson and the guys he'd brought across with him, and > Hitchen... so presumably they sorted it out between them afterwards, but > that was the fix: that Hoban should win. I know for certain that it was. Elliott, braking to stop Hitchen behind him, so Simpson could win, was riding in Simpson's pay. Simpson offered Elliott ¬£1,000 to help him win the world championship in 1963. Elliott refused, speculation being that he had been offered more by someone else.Simpson, Tom, \\"World champ but they call me a crook\\", The People, London, 19 September 1965 Elliott later wrote a newspaper article suggesting that he made more money by selling races than winning them. Decline Elliott's career started to fade from the mid-1960s. He moved in 1966 from Anquetil's team to the rival Mercier-BP, sponsored by a bicycle company and an oil company and led by Anquetil's rival, Raymond Poulidor. Elliott planned for retirement by opening a hotel in Loctudy in Brittany. He had no prior experience in the hospitality trade and that project took so much of his time that he could ride only local races. After promising Mercier-BP that he would make amends in the world championship, the chain came off his bicycle and he finished 15th. Things grew worse. His marriage to Marguerite, failed.Healy, Graham (2011) Shay Elliott ‚Äì The Life and Death of Ireland's First Yellow Jersey, Mousehold Press The hotel, too, failed and Elliott lost all his money. To try to restore his situation, he sold a story to the British tabloid newspaper, The People, telling of drug-taking and bribery. The article went into few details but was enough for him to be snubbed by other professionals. The same had happened to Simpson when he sold his story to the same paper but while Simpson recovered despite reprimands from his agent, criticism in the cycling press and a threat of dismissal by his team,Fotheringham, William (2002), Put Me Back on my Bike, Yellow Jersey, UK Elliott's career never regained momentum. British cycling journalist Jock Wadley, who had shared a room with Elliott at the Simplex training camp, said: \\"I knew times were hard for him but nobody knew just how hard until he had to do that.\\" Later years Elliott returned to Dublin in 1967 and set up a metal-working business in Prince's Street in the city centre, with his father. Marguerite remained in France, with his only son, Pascal. Friends helped him to build a small apartment above the business. Elliott tried a racing comeback in Britain in 1970 with the Falcon Cycles team and came 21st in his first race, London-Holyhead. Domestic professional racing was not as attractive or rewarding as continental. Combining cycling with a full-time job meant he struggled. =Cycling in Ireland= Despite problems, he continued to ride - he was active with the Bray Wheelers club based south of Dublin, training juniors and formulating plans for Irish cycling. He once ran for vice- president of the Irish Cycling Federation, but lost to Paddy McQuaid. Death On 21 April 1971, his father died. Two weeks after his father's death, on 4 May 1971, Shay Elliott was found dead in the living quarters above the family business premises, at the age of just 36. The cause of death was a shotgun wound, rupturing his heart and liver, from a gun about whose unreliable fittings friends had warned him. The coroner recorded an \\"open verdict\\" and three competing theories circulated about the cause of death: that it was indeed a gun accident, that he committed suicide, and that he was killed by a Breton crime syndicate to whom he owed money from his failed hotel business (he had worried about people \\"hanging round\\" near the premises in previous weeks). He was laid to rest alongside his father at St Mochonog's Church, Kilmacanogue, County Wicklow. Legacy The Shay Elliott Memorial Road Race is run every year in Ireland in his honour. The race was previously (since 1959) known as the Route de Chill Mhantain (Circuit of Wicklow). It became the Shay Elliott Trophy in the late sixties, then the Shay Elliott Memorial after his death in 1971. A monument to Elliott, erected by friends and Bray Cycling Club, stands at the top of the climb from Drumgoff Bridge, Glenmalure heading towards Laragh, County Wicklow, where the race's KOH mountain prime is situated. Delegates from the Tour de France visited Elliott's grave when the Tour came to Ireland in 1998. McKay Feargal, Podium Cafe - \\"The Irish Flahute\\", 24 February 2017 (republished from 2011), visited 2018-09-02 Coverage In 2009 a documentary film, Cycle of Betrayal, about Shay Elliott, was shown in Ireland (first on Setanta Ireland) and the UK. A book, a section of a book, and many articles, have also been written about Elliott.

It is listed as critically endangered by IUCN. It was feared extinct, but was finally rediscovered during surveys on Peleng Island off the southeast coast of Sulawesi by Indonesian ornithologist Mochamad Indrawan in 2007 and 2008. It was sometimes considered a subspecies of the slender-billed crow, but it is actually rather distinct from this bird, resembling an entirely black piping crow overall. The Banggai crow is a small crow, some 39 cm long and completely black with a pale iris and a short tail.Vaurie (1958), Madge & Burn (1994). For more than a century, it was known from only two specimens taken from an unknown island in the Banggai Archipelago - probably in 1884/1885. Visits to the archipelago in 1991 and 1996 yielded no unequivocal records of the species, leading some to believe it was extinct. During a survey conducted between 2007 and 2008 and partially financed by the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (Germany), it was repeatedly seen on Peleng IslandAssociation for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots and Indonesian ornithologist Mochamad Indrawan caught and photographed two individuals.ZGAP Mitteilungen 23/2 (2008), pp. 13-14 (German) The validity of the crows on Peleng was not recognized by BirdLife International in its 2009 Red List. Confirmation of the identity based on two specimens from Peleng was made by Pamela C. Rasmussen of the American Museum of Natural History in October 2009. The total population is estimated at approximately 500 mature individuals, living in mountain forest at altitudes above 500 m. The decline of the Banggai crow is thought to be primarily due to habitat loss and degradation through agriculture and extraction. This bird remained a complete enigma for a long time. Listed as Vulnerable in the 1994 IUCN Red List, it was changed to Endangered in 2000. In 2006, the status was considered as Possibly Extinct. This proved to be incorrect and the status was corrected to Critically Endangered in the 2007 Red List.See Collar et al. (2001), BirdLife International (2004, 2007a,b).

Inherent patterns of human aggression which inspire practice of mock combat (in particular wrestling) and optimization of serious close combat as cultural universals are doubtlessly inherited from the pre-human stage and were made into an \\"art\\" from the earliest emergence of that concept. Indeed, many universals of martial art are fixed by the specifics of human physiology and not dependent on a specific tradition or era. Specific martial traditions become identifiable in Classical Antiquity, with disciplines such as shuai jiao, Greek wrestling or those described in the Indian epics or the Spring and Autumn Annals of China. The Boxer of Quirinal resting after contest (Bronze sculpture, 3rd century BCE) Early history Minoan youths boxing, reconstruction of a Knossos fresco (1500 BC). Earliest evidence for use of gloves. The earliest evidence for specifics of martial arts as practiced in the past comes from depictions of fights, both in figurative art and in early literature, besides analysis of archaeological evidence, especially of weaponry. The oldest work of art depicting scenes of battle, dating back 3400 BC,World grappling styles .

Humanities dimension of physiotherapy, rehabilitation, nursing and public health. p. 21 Dating back to 3000 BC in Mesopotamia (Babylon), reliefs and the poems depicting struggle were found. In Vietnam, drawings and sketches from 2879 BCE describe certain ways of combat using sword, stick, bow, and spears. The spear has been in use since the Lower Paleolithic and retained its central importance well into the 2nd millennium AD. The bow appears in the Upper Paleolithic and is likewise only gradually replaced by the crossbow, and eventually firearms, in the Present Day. True bladed weapons appear in the Neolithic with the stone axe, and diversify in shape in the course of the Bronze Age (khopesh/kopis, sword, dagger) Some early examples are the depiction of wrestling techniques in a tomb of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt at Beni Hasan (c. 2000 BC) and pictorial representations of fist fighting in the Minoan civilization dating to the 2nd millennium BCE. In ancient China, Yellow Emperor (2698 BC) is described as a famous general who, before becoming China‚Äôs leader, wrote lengthy treatises on medicine, astrology and the martial arts. Literary descriptions of combat began in the 2nd millennium BC, with mention of weaponry and combat in texts like the Gilgamesh epic or the Rig-Veda. Detailed description of Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age hand-to-hand combat with spear, sword and shield are found in the Iliad (c. 8th century BC) and also the Mahabharatha. Africa Detail of the wrestling fresco in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan. An Egyptian fresco, dated to 3400 BC, and depicting military training at Beni Hassan is the world's oldest known artistic representation of an organised fighting system. In gymnasiums similar to those of Greece, recruits would practice wrestling, callisthenics and duelling with single-stick. The attacking weapon apparently had a basket-guard protecting the hand, while the left forearm had a splint strapped on to serve as a shield. Soldiers fought with spears, large shields with an eye-hole, clubs, axes, poleaxes, flails, bows, slings, and swords of various forms. Later, martial styles as varied as Gidigbo (a form of wrestling practiced by the Yoruba people of Nigeria), Donga (a form of stickfighting practiced by the Suri people of Ethiopia), Musangwe (a form of bare-knuckle boxing practiced by the Venda people of South Africa), Tahtib (a form of stickfighting practiced by the Copts of Egypt) and Engolo (a form of kicking, dodging and leg sweeping practiced by the tribes of the Cunene river region of Angola), to name just a few, were developed by cultures all over Africa.

In the Song and Yuan dynasties, xiangpu (the earliest form of sumo) contests were sponsored by the imperial courts.The customary Bowing of martial arts is thus due to the \\"transmission of the task or work to be carried out\\", in ancient times precisely for the reigning Empire With regards to the Shaolin fighting system, the oldest evidence of Shaolin participation in combat is a stele from 728 CE that attests to two occasions: a defense of the Shaolin Monastery from bandits around 610 CE, and their subsequent role in the defeat of Wang Shichong at the Battle of Hulao in 621 CE. From the 8th to the 15th centuries, there are no extant documents that provide evidence of Shaolin participation in combat. =Late Ming= The modern concepts of wushu emerge by the late Ming to early Qing dynasties (16th to 17th centuries).China Sportlight Series (1986) \\"Sports and Games in Ancient China\\". New World Press, . Between the 16th and 17th centuries there are at least forty extant sources which provided evidence that, not only did monks of Shaolin practice martial arts, but martial practice had become such an integral element of Shaolin monastic life that the monks felt the need to justify it by creating new Buddhist lore.Shahar, Meir (2000). \\"Epigraphy, Buddhist Historiography, and Fighting Monks: The Case of The Shaolin Monastery\\". Asia Major Third Series 13 (2): 15‚Äì36. References of martial practice in Shaolin appear in various literary genres of the late Ming: the epitaphs of Shaolin warrior monks, martial-arts manuals, military encyclopedias, historical writings, travelogues, fiction, and even poetry. However these sources do not point out to any specific style originated in Shaolin.Shahar, Meir (December 2001). \\"Ming-Period Evidence of Shaolin Martial Practice\\". Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 61 (2): 359‚Äì413. . These sources, in contrast to those from the Tang period, refer to Shaolin methods of armed combat. This include the forte of Shaolin monks and for which they had become famous ‚Äî the staff (gun); General Qi Jiguang included these techniques in his book, Treatise of Effective Discipline. Despite the fact that others criticized the techniques, Ming General Yu Dayou visited the temple and was not impressed with what he saw, he recruited three monks who he would train for few years after which they returned to the temple to train his fellow monks.Henning, Stanley (1999). \\"Martial arts Myths of Shaolin Monastery, Part I: The Giant with the Flaming Staff\\".

The term dwandwayuddha referred to a duel, such that it was a battle between only two warriors and not armies. The Mahabharata describes a prolonged battle between Arjuna and Karna using bows, swords, trees, and fists.Zarrilli, Phillip B. A South Indian Martial Art and the Yoga and Ayurvedic Paradigms. University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Stories describing Krishna report that he sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, hair pulling, and strangleholds. Another unarmed battle in the Mahabharata describes two fighters boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts.Section XIII: Samayapalana Parva, Book 4: Virata Parva, Mahabharata. Krishna Maharaja, who single-handedly overcame an elephant according to the Mahabharata, is credited with developing the sixteen principles of armed combat. Many of the popular sports mentioned in the Vedas and the epics have their origins in military training, such as boxing (musti- yuddha), wrestling (malladwandwa), chariot-racing (rathachalan), horse-riding (aswarohana) and archery (dhanurvidya). Competitions were held not just as a contest of the players' prowess but also as a means of finding a bridegroom. Arjuna, Rama and Siddhartha Gautama all won their consorts in such tournaments. Ten fighting styles of northern India were said to have been created in different areas based on animals and gods, and designed for the particular geography of their origin. Tradition ascribes their convergence to the 6th-century in the Buddhist university of Takshashila, located in today's Punjab region. =Middle Ages= Like other branches of Sanskrit literature, treatises on martial arts become more systematic in the course of the 1st millennium CE. The grappling art of vajra-mushti is mentioned in sources of the early centuries CE. Military accounts of the Gupta Empire (c. 240-480) and the later Agni Purana identify over 130 different weapons, divided into thrown and unthrown classes and further into sub-classes.Parmeshwaranand Swami, Encyclopaedic Dictionary of PurƒÅ·πáas, Sarup & Sons, 2001, , s.v. \\"dhanurveda\\"; Ga·πÖgƒÅ RƒÅm Garg, Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Concept Publishing Company, 1992 , s.v. \\"archery\\". The Kama Sutra written by VƒÅtsyƒÅyana suggested that women should regularly \\"practice with sword, single-stick, quarterstaff, and bow and arrow.\\" The Sushruta Samhita (c. 4th century) identifies 107 vital points on the human bodyG. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita. of which 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick. Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline ayurveda which was taught alongside various martial arts. With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that Indian subcontinent's early fighters knew and practised attacking or defending vital points. Fighting arts were not exclusive to the kshatriya caste, though the warrior class used the systems more extensively. The 8th-century text Kuvalaymala by Udyotanasuri recorded such systems being taught at gurukula educational institutions, where Brahmin students from throughout the subcontinent \\"were learning and practicing archery, fighting with sword and shield, with daggers, sticks, lances, and with fists, and in duels (niuddham).\\" The earliest extant manual of Indian martial arts is contained as chapters 248 to 251 in the Agni Purana (c. 8th ‚Äì 11th centuries), giving an account of dhanurveda in a total of 104 shloka.P.

(Bibliotheca Indica, 65,1-3); AP 248.1-38, 249.1-19, 250.1-13, 251.1-34. These verses describe how to improve a warrior's individual prowess and kill enemies using various different methods in warfare, whether a warrior went to war in chariots, elephants, horses, or on foot. Foot methods were subdivided into armed combat and unarmed combat.J. R. Svinth (2002). A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports. Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences. The former included the bow and arrow, the sword, spear, noose, armour, iron dart, club, battle axe, discus, and the trident. The latter included wrestling, knee strikes, and punching and kicking methods. Japan The historical origin of Japanese martial arts can be found in the warrior traditions of the samurai and the caste system that restricted the use of weapons by members of the non-warrior classes. Originally, samurai were expected to be proficient in many weapons, as well as unarmed combat, and attain the highest possible mastery of combat skills, for the purpose of glorifying either themselves or their liege. A large number of schools evolved to teach these skills with those existing before the Meiji Restoration classed as or old stream. Over time there was a trend away from the traditional purpose to a philosophy of coupling spiritual goals with the striving to perfect their martial skills. The Japanese Book of Five Rings dates to 1664. Korea Taekkyon is the traditional martial art of Korea. Taekkyon came into existence sometime before the Silla Dynasty united the peninsula. It is believed Taekkyon was known as Subak at that time. Taekkyon focuses on up- right fighting: footwork, kicks, strikes, blocks, throws and rhythm. Ssireum is the traditional wrestling art of Korea. Gakjeochong (Í∞ÅÏ†ÄÏ¥ù:ËßíÊäµÂ°ö) murals show that wrestling in Korea dates back as early as the pre-Three Kingdom era. The Book of Later Han, a Chinese document that was written either before or early in the history of the Three Kingdoms also has records of Korean wrestling. Ssireum first gained widespread popularity during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). Two Korean martial arts manuals Muyejebo and Muyedobotongji date from 1598 and 1790, respectively. Europe=Antiquity Pankratiast in fighting stance, Ancient Greek red-figure amphora, 440 BC. European martial arts become tangible in Greek antiquity with pankration and other martially oriented disciplines of the ancient Olympic Games. Boxing became Olympic in Greece as early as 688 BCE. Detailed depictions of wrestling techniques are preserved in vase paintings of the Classical period. Homer's Iliad has a number of detailed descriptions of single combat with spear, sword and shield. Gladiatorial combat appears to have Etruscan roots, and is documented in Rome from the 260s BCE. The papyrus fragment known as P.Oxy. III 466 dating from the 2nd century gives the earliest surviving description in writing of wrestling techniques. In Sardinia, a Mediterranean island, a fighting style which has been called istrumpa was practised in the Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the finding of a little bronze statue (known as \\"Bronzetto dei lottatori\\" or \\"bronze of the fighting men\\"), which shows two fighters struggling with each other on the ground. Middle Ages Fol. 4v of the I.33 Pictorial sources of medieval combat include the Bayeux tapestry (11th century), the Morgan Bible (13th century). The Icelandic sagas contain many realistic descriptions of Viking Age combat. The earliest extant dedicated martial arts manual is the MS I.33 (c. 1300), detailing sword and buckler combat, compiled in a Franconian monastery. The manuscript consists of 64 images with Latin commentary, interspersed with technical vocabulary in German. While there are earlier manuals of wrestling techniques, I.33 is the earliest known manual dedicated to teaching armed single combat. Wrestling throughout the Middle Ages was practiced by all social strata. Jousting and the tournament were popular martial arts practiced by nobility throughout the High and Late Middle Ages. The Late Middle Ages see the appearance of elaborate fencing systems, such as the German or Italian schools. In the Late Middle Ages, fencing schools (Fechtschulen) for the new bourgeois class become popular, increasing the demand for professional instructors (fencing masters, Fechtmeister). The martial arts techniques taught in this period is preserved in a number of 15th-century Fechtb√ºcher. Renaissance to Early Modern period The late medieval German school survives into the German Renaissance, and there are a number of printed 16th-century manuals (notably the one by Joachim Meyer, 1570). But by the 17th century, the German school declines in favour of the Italian Dardi school, reflecting the transition to rapier fencing in the upper classes. Wrestling comes to be seen as an ignoble pursuit proper for the lower classes and until its 19th-century revival as a modern sport becomes restricted to folk wrestling. In the Baroque period, fashion shifts from Italian to Spanish masters, and their elaborate systems of Destreza. In the mid-18th century, in keeping with the general Rococo fashion, French masters rise to international prominence, introducing the foil, and much of the terminology still current in modern sports fencing. There are also a number of Early Modern fencing masters of note in England, such as George Silver and Joseph Swetnam. Academic fencing takes its origin in the Middle Ages, and is subject to the changes of fencing fashion throughout the Early Modern period. It establishes itself as the separate style of Mensur fencing in the 18th Middle East The traditional Persian style of grappling was known as koshti, with the physical exercise and schooled sport known as varzesh-e bastani. It is saidNekoogar, Farzad (1996). Traditional Iranian Martial Arts (Varzesh-e Pahlavani). pahlvani.com: Menlo Park. Accessed: 2007-02-08 to be traceable back to Arsacid Parthian times (132 BCE - 226 CE), and is still widely practiced today in the region. Following the development of Sufi Islam in the 8th century CE, varzesh-e pahlavani absorbed philosophical and spiritual components from that religion. Other historical grappling styles from the region include Turkic forms such as kurash, k√∂r√§≈ü and yaƒülƒ± g√ºre≈ü. The north Arabian tradition of horsemanship quickly became an integral part of warfare throughout the Arab world and much of the Middle East. The Middle Ages saw the flourishing of the furusiyya culture, combining the ancient Bedouin concept of honour (muru'ah) with the Islamic ideals of chivalry. A ' (meaning knight or horseman) would first hone his skills in wrestling and armed combat on the ground before learning to fight while mounted. Furusiyya literature from the 9th to 15th century deal with equestrianism, archery, military strategy, duelling and charging with the lance. Armed fighting included the use of the sword (sayf), spear, lance, javelin, dagger (jambiya), staff, axe (tabar), warhammer, and curved bow. There is also Tahtib (ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿ∑Ÿäÿ®) which was practiced in ancient Egypt and is still performed in celebrations. Modern history (1800 to present) The Western interest in East Asian martial arts dates back to the late 19th century, due to the increase in trade between the West with China and Japan. European martial arts before that time was focused on the duelling sword among the upper classes on one hand, and various styles of folk wrestling among the lower classes on the other. Savate appears in the early 19th century in France, as a mix between English boxing and French folk kicking techniques. At that time, in France, it existed in gyms called salles d'armes where savate, English boxing, fencing, canne de combat and sometimes even wrestling was practiced. Edward William Barton-Wright, a British railway engineer who had studied jujutsu while working in Japan between 1894‚Äì97, was the first man known to have taught Asian martial arts in Europe. He also founded an eclectic martial arts style named Bartitsu which combined jujutsu, judo, wrestling, boxing, savate and stick fighting. Also during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, catch wrestling contests became immensely popular in Europe. The development of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu from the early 20th century is a good example of the worldwide cross-pollination and syncretism of martial arts traditions. The later 1970s and 1980s witnessed an increased media interest in the martial arts, thanks in part to Asian and Hollywood martial arts movies and very popular television shows like \\"Kung Fu\\", \\"Martial Law\\" and \\"The Green Hornet\\" that incorporated martial arts moments or themes. Following Bruce Lee, both Jackie Chan and Jet Li are prominent movie figures who have been responsible for promoting Chinese martial arts in recent years. Reconstruction The reconstruction of a martial art as practiced in a specific period is distinct from the practice of a traditional fighting system handed down by way of master-student transmission. The largest movement of martial arts reconstruction is the Historical European Martial Arts revival (HEMA), gaining momentum since the late 1990s. To a limited extent, there are also attempts to reconstruct other styles, such as Korean swordsmanship and Persian armed combat called razmafzar. The Japanese term Kory≈´ refers to \\"old schools\\" of martial arts which predate 1868; it does not imply that historical styles are actively reconstructed, just that the school's tradition goes back 150 years or more. A reconstructed martial art necessarily rests on historical records, either combat manuals or pictorial representations. Martial arts reconstruction specifically does not claim an unbroken tradition of some historical martial arts. On the contrary, the premise is that in an unbroken tradition, styles significantly evolve over time. It is not necessary for the tradition to have been interrupted in order to reconstruct an earlier style; a case in point is classical fencing which reconstructs the sport fencing of the 19th century before it evolved into current Olympic fencing, or historical German ringen which over time developed into contemporary styles of folk wrestling. Claims of ancient martial arts which survive unchanged by unbroken tradition (e.g. as suggested by Yehoshua Sofer), do not fall under reconstruction and are by their nature unverifiable, even to the person making the claim. Certain modern schools of Ninjutsu may fall under the category of martial arts reconstruction; the Bujinkan organization claims to base their teaching on a manuscript documenting a historical school, known as Togakure- ry≈´, dated to the 12th century. But as this manuscript is supposedly in the private possession of Masaaki Hatsumi, its authenticity, or indeed existence, cannot be verified by independent parties.

Administration  In 1990 concessions were leased with toll collection on the busiest national roads, dividing the country in zones called \\"Corredores Viales\\". The section between the junction with National Route 9 in Z√°rate and the junction with National Route 14 in Ceibas is part of Corridor Vial 18, under the management of Caminos del R√≠o Uruguay (CRUSA) with a toll booth in Z√°rate (km marker 85).Resoluci√≥n 26/2003 de la Comisi√≥n de Renegociaci√≥n de Contratos de Obras y Servicios P√∫blicos, Ministerio de Econom√≠a y Producci√≥n In 1996 the concession was extended to 28 years with the condicion that the bidding company built a highway between the Complejo Uni√≥n Nacional and Gualeguaych√∫. The section between the General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza bridge and Ceibas was completed on October 12, 1999. Due to the currency devaluation of 2002, road work in the Ceibas - Gualeguaych√∫ section was delayed. The Virgen de Itat√≠ Concesionaria de Obras Viales (VICOV) company took control of Corridor Vial 13, including, among others, Route 12 between km markers 871 and 1641, in the provinces of Corrientes and Misiones, from the junction with National Route 123 to the access to the Tancredo Neves International Bridge, excluding the section near the provincial capital city of Posadas (km 1336-1349) installing toll booths in Riachuelo (km 1014), Ituzaing√≥ (km 1262), Santa Ana (km 1374) and Colonia Victoria (km 1551). In 2003 the Corredores Viales concession contracts expired, and the numbering system was changed when calling for a new bidding process. Corridor Vial 6 is now controlled by Empresa Concesionaria Vial (Emcovial) and includes Route 12 in the same section as the previous concession.Corredores Viales Nacionales - OCCOVI  Old roadbed  Originally National Route 12 had a different layout through the provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre R√≠os and Corrientes. The original road started in Buenos Aires, passing through General Pacheco, Campana and Z√°rate. The section between Z√°rate's port and Puerto Constanza, in Entre R√≠os Province, crossed the Paran√° river by barge in a 3-hour crossing.Memoria de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Vialidad, a√±o 1937Gu√≠a Peuser de turismo, a√±o 1950, Editorial Peuser After the change of route of National Route 9, in the late 1950s, the section from Avenida General Paz and Campana was changed to RN12. In 2005 the 8 km section between National Route 9 in Campana and the Bartolom√© Mitre bridge access over the Paran√° de las Palmas river changed to Buenos Aires provincial jurisdiction as a new section of Provincial Route 6. RN12 runs over the ol roadbed of National Route 193 to the bridge over National Route 9 in Z√°rate. After Ceibas it followed the present National Route 14, traversing near Gualeguaych√∫, and the present Provincial Route 20, passing through Urdinarrain, Basavilbaso, Villaguay, Federal (Entre R√≠os province) and San Jos√© de Feliciano. In Corrientes Province, the road continued through Provincial Route 23 passing by Sauce and Perugorr√≠a, then by the present Provincial Route 24 until the junction with the present National Route 12. This old roadbed changed to federal control by National Decree 1595 of 1979 except the National Route 14 section between Ceibas and the junction with Provincial Route 20. ON the new roadbed the section between General Galarza and Nogoy√°, on the south of Entre R√≠os Province was still unopened. In 2005, the Direcci√≥n Nacional de Vialidad signed an agreement with its provincial counterpart to receive transfer of sections of provincial routes 6 and 39 to complete the missing sections of RN12.

Built in 1917 by Katharine Smith Reynolds and her husband R. J. Reynolds, founder of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the house originally occupied the center of a estate. It opened to the public as an institution dedicated to the arts and education in 1965, and as an art museum in 1967. The house holds one of the country's finest collections of American paintings. It is located in Winston- Salem, North Carolina. History Design and construction began in 1912 and lasted until the end of 1917. Charles Barton Keen, who had gained notable success designing homes in Pennsylvania and New York, was the architect of not only the main house, but also the village that included a church, stables, and a school, on the estate. Katharine Reynolds was very involved with the design of Reynolda, and some of her correspondences with Keen survive. The family finally moved in December 1917, but R. J. Reynolds was ill with pancreatic cancer and was not able to enjoy his new home. He died July 29, 1918. Reynolda was the home of two generations of the Reynolds family. In 1935, Mary Reynolds Babcock, the elder daughter, acquired the estate. She and her husband Charles Babcock used the house as their vacation home until 1948, at which time they moved permanently to Reynolda. The property remained in the family for nearly 50 years. The museum has restored interior rooms and furnishings to reflect the periods when the family lived there. Reynolda became affiliated with Wake Forest University in 2002. Features View of Reynolda House, ca. 1915 Located on Reynolda Road, a large portion of Reynolda can be explored on foot. In addition to the house, 28 of the original thirty buildings remain. To the west lie the restored formal gardens, noted for their Japanese cryptomeria and weeping cherry trees. The lake behind the house (\\"Lake Katharine\\") has reverted to wetlands, which provide a home for a variety of wildlife. Many of the buildings in the village are now occupied by boutiques, shops, and restaurants. A short walk across the dam leads from the village to Wake Forest University, built on land donated from the grounds of Reynolda House to the college by Mary and Charles Babcock. A French restaurant, La Chaudiere, once occupied the family's former boiler room, but closed in the 1990s. Permanent collection Reynolda House Museum of American Art houses a permanent collection of American art and sculpture from three centuries. The artists featured in the collection include Mary Cassatt, Frederic Church, Jacob Lawrence, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Gilbert Stuart. Most of the pieces are displayed throughout the historic house.

It can also refer to the population parameter that is estimated by the MAD calculated from a sample. For a univariate data set X1, X2, ..., Xn, the MAD is defined as the median of the absolute deviations from the data's median \\\\tilde{X}=\\\\operatorname{median}(X) : : \\\\operatorname{MAD} = \\\\operatorname{median}( X_i - \\\\tilde{X}) that is, starting with the residuals (deviations) from the data's median, the MAD is the median of their absolute values. Example Consider the data (1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 9). It has a median value of 2. The absolute deviations about 2 are (1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 4, 7) which in turn have a median value of 1 (because the sorted absolute deviations are (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7)). So the median absolute deviation for this data is 1. Uses The median absolute deviation is a measure of statistical dispersion. Moreover, the MAD is a robust statistic, being more resilient to outliers in a data set than the standard deviation. In the standard deviation, the distances from the mean are squared, so large deviations are weighted more heavily, and thus outliers can heavily influence it. In the MAD, the deviations of a small number of outliers are irrelevant. Because the MAD is a more robust estimator of scale than the sample variance or standard deviation, it works better with distributions without a mean or variance, such as the Cauchy distribution.  Relation to standard deviation  The MAD may be used similarly to how one would use the deviation for the average. In order to use the MAD as a consistent estimator for the estimation of the standard deviation \\\\sigma, one takes : \\\\hat{\\\\sigma} = k \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{MAD}, where k is a constant scale factor, which depends on the distribution. For normally distributed data k is taken to be : k = 1/\\\\left(\\\\Phi^{-1}(3/4)\\\\right) \\\\approx 1.4826, i.e., the reciprocal of the quantile function \\\\Phi^{-1} (also known as the inverse of the cumulative distribution function) for the standard normal distribution Z = (X - \\\\mu) / \\\\sigma. The argument 3/4 is such that \\\\pm \\\\operatorname{MAD} covers 50% (between 1/4 and 3/4) of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, i.e. : \\\\frac 12 = P(X - \\\\mu \\\\le \\\\operatorname{MAD}) = P\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\frac{X - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right \\\\le \\\\frac {\\\\operatorname{MAD}} \\\\sigma\\\\right) = P\\\\left(Z \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{MAD}}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right). Therefore, we must have that : \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{MAD} / \\\\sigma\\\\right) - \\\\Phi\\\\left(-\\\\operatorname{MAD} / \\\\sigma\\\\right) = 1/2. Noticing that : \\\\Phi\\\\left(-\\\\operatorname{MAD} / \\\\sigma\\\\right) = 1 - \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{MAD} / \\\\sigma\\\\right), we have that \\\\operatorname{MAD} / \\\\sigma = \\\\Phi^{-1}(3/4) = 0.67449, from which we obtain the scale factor k = 1 / \\\\Phi^{-1}(3/4) = 1.4826. Another way of establishing the relationship is noting that MAD equals the half-normal distribution median: : \\\\operatorname{MAD} = \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(1/2) \\\\approx 0.67449 \\\\sigma. This form is used in, e.g., the probable error.  Geometric median absolute deviation  Similarly to how the median generalizes to the geometric median in multivariate data, a geometric MAD can be constructed that generalizes the MAD. Given a 2 dimensional paired set of data (X1,Y1), (X2,Y2),..., (Xn,Yn) and a suitably calculated geometric median (\\\\tilde{X},\\\\tilde{Y}) , the geometric median absolute deviation is given by: > \\\\operatorname{MAD} = \\\\Bigl(\\\\operatorname{median}(X_{i}-\\\\tilde{X})^2 + > \\\\operatorname{median}(Y_{i}-\\\\tilde{Y})^2\\\\Bigr)^{1/2} This gives the identical result as the univariate MAD in 1 dimension and extends easily to higher dimensions. In the case of complex values (X+iY), the relation of MAD to the standard deviation is unchanged for normally distributed data.  The population MAD  The population MAD is defined analogously to the sample MAD, but is based on the complete distribution rather than on a sample. For a symmetric distribution with zero mean, the population MAD is the 75th percentile of the distribution. Unlike the variance, which may be infinite or undefined, the population MAD is always a finite number. For example, the standard Cauchy distribution has undefined variance, but its MAD is 1. The earliest known mention of the concept of the MAD occurred in 1816, in a paper by Carl Friedrich Gauss on the determination of the accuracy of numerical observations.

Today The Dakota Prairie School District still uses the high school building in Petersburg and the elementary building in McVille for regular classes. Sent to these two schools are 408 students from eleven communities (McVille, Hamar, Tolna, Pekin, Kloten, Aneta, Niagara, Whitman, Petersburg, Dahlen, and Michigan). Students also come from seven different counties in North Dakota: Nelson, Griggs, Grand Forks, Eddy, Walsh, Benson, and Ramsey. The entire school district covers approximately . Campus The campus of Dakota Prairie High School is located in Petersburg. The school building takes up approximately one-half of the city block. The building has eleven classrooms, which include one band and chorus room, one computer lab, two science rooms, and one technology education room. There also are two special education rooms and one gymnasium. A recent weight room has been added onto the school campus for the students and faculty to use. Students and teachers Dakota Prairie currently enrolls 161 students, 54% of whom are male, and 46% female. There are currently fourteen teachers who teach full- time. The student to teacher ratio is 13:1. 1% of the students are Native American, 1% are African American, and 98% are white. As of 2013, the largest class numbered 30 students, which will be the graduating class of 2020. Sports The logo used by Dakota Prairie High School Students are allowed to be involved in one or more sports at Dakota Prairie High School as long as they meet certain criteria set by the school. Commonly, this involves passing all classes. Dakota Prairie is involved in \\"Class B\\" North Dakota sports, including football, volleyball, basketball, golf, track and field, and baseball. They generally offer sports in junior varsity divisions and a varsity division. The football and volleyball teams play in the fall, the basketball (both boys' and girls' teams) in the winter, and the baseball, track and field, and golf teams play in the spring.Dakota Prairie High School website Championships *State class \\"B\\" baseball: 1994 *State class \\"B\\" baseball runner-up: 2008 *State class \\"B\\" basketball runner-up: 2009 See also *List of High Schools in North Dakota ReferencesExternal links *Dakota Prairie High School Category:Public high schools in North Dakota Category:North Dakota High School Activities Association (Class B) Category:North Dakota High School Activities Association (9-Man Football) Category:Schools in Nelson County, North Dakota Category:1993 establishments in North Dakota ","title":"Dakota Prairie High School"},{"id":"10051054","text":"Helen Steiner Rice (May 19, 1900 ‚Äì April 23, 1981) was an American writer of religious and inspirational poetry.

She began work for a public utility and progressed to the position of advertising manager, which was rare for a woman at that time. She also became the Ohio State Chairman of the Women's Public Information Committee of the Electric Light Association, and campaigned for women's rights and improved working conditions.Helen Steiner Rice at Ohio History Central In 1929, she married Franklin Dryden Rice, a bank vice- president in Dayton, Ohio. After the stock market crash in October that year, Franklin lost his job and his investments. He fell into a depression from which he never recovered and committed suicide in 1932. Rice became a successful businesswoman and lecturer but found her most satisfying outlet in writing verse for the greeting card company Gibson Greetings. Her poems received wide exposure in the 1960s when several were read by Aladdin on the poetry segment of the Lawrence Welk television show.

Career Khanyeza's arrival from Lamontville Golden Arrows in July 2007 after he had spent five seasons at the KwaZulu-Natal based team and scored 43 goals in the 102 official league and cup matches that he had participated in between 2002 and 2007, was according to many commentators bound to happen sooner or later. And for some it was inevitable that the soft-spoken man from the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal would eventually don the gold and black strip of The Amakhosi. Khenyeza was a major hit on his official debut for Chiefs on the opening night of the 2007‚Äì2008 season, after coming close to scoring as he was unfortunate to have hit the cross bar twice in the game. He managed to find the back of the net against Benoni Premier United from the penalty spot in the final minute of the game, which gave him a goal on debut. Often thought of as one of the players who has perhaps not represented his country as regularly as he should have, Khanyeza‚Äôs move to Chiefs is a step in the right direction as apart from the possibility of adding silverware to his cupboards he has put himself in a stronger position to receive more national team call ups. Thus far the player who made his name at Lamontville Golden Arrows will be remembered for his wonder goal against Chiefs arch rivals Orlando Pirates in November 2007, a goal he scored just nineteen seconds into the game. Ajax Cape Town Khenyeza moved to Ajax CT in 2008 after he fell out with Kaizer Chiefs coach Muhsin Ertugral. He arrive as a free agent and he was one of the top scorer of 2008-2009 season. At the end of the season left the club and signed for Mamelodi Sundowns. Mamelodi Sundowns Since his arrival Khenyeza had become a regular first team player in the team. He had 10 goals and 9 assists in 57 games. Supersport United After leaving Mamelodi Sundowns for free in January 2012 he signed for Supersport United. On total he played 22 games for the club, fifteen of whom as a starter. He scored four goals and provided three assists. Ajax Cape Town Khenyeza rejoined Ajax CT in January 2013.

This involves national, ethnic, disability- based, or other groups that are often thought to be marginalized from political, social, and economic opportunities. The saying has its origins in Central European political traditions. It was the political motto that helped establish‚Äîand, loosely translated into Latin, provided the name for‚ÄîPoland's 1505 constitutional legislation, Nihil novi, which first transferred governing authority from the monarch to the parliament. It subsequently became a byword for democratic norms. In this use, it is closely analogous to one of the most familiar slogans of the American Revolutionary War, 'No taxation without representation'. It is also a long-standing principle of Hungarian law and foreign policy, and was a cornerstone of the foreign policy of interwar Poland. The term in its English form came into use in disability activism during the 1990s. James Charlton relates that he first heard the term used in talks by South African disability activists Michael Masutha and William Rowland, who had in turn heard the phrase used by an unnamed East European activist at an earlier international disability rights conference. In 1998, Charlton used the saying as title for a book on disability rights. Disability rights activist David Werner used the same title for another book, also published in 1998.Nothing About Us Without Us: Developing Innovative Technologies For, By and With Disabled Persons, Healthwrights, Palo Alto CA, 1998 The saying has since moved from the disability rights movement to other interest group, identity politics, and populist movements.

New Series, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Dec., 1968) and was a member of the legislative council in Lagos from 1918-1924\\\\. Background and education Henry Carr was born in Lagos, British Nigeria on 15 August 1863 to Amuwo Carr and Rebecca Carr, liberated Saro emigrants of Yoruba extraction. Amuwo Carr died in Abeokuta when Henry was seven years old, leaving Rebecca Carr in charge of young Henry's education. Henry attended Wesleyan School, Olowogbowo for his elementary education. He was sponsored by Reverend T.B. Thomas, a close friend of his mother, to attend Wesleyan Highs School in Freetown, British Sierra Leone for his secondary education. In Sierra Leone, he attended Fourah Bay College where he received an honours degree in 1880. He was the first graduate of the school to achieve the feat. He then went to England and signed up for courses at Lincoln's Inn, St. Mark's College, Chelsea, (now University of St Mark & St John) and the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. Thereafter, he graduated with an honors B.A. in mathematics and physical science at Durham University in 1882. In 1906 he took a B.C.L degree at Lincoln's Inn and in the same year was made Chancellor of the Diocese of Western Equatorial Africa. Henry Carr was married to the former Henrietta Robbin. Career in West Africa He returned to Nigeria in 1885 and taught at the CMS Grammar School, Lagos until joining the Colonial Civil Service in 1889 as chief clerk in the Secretariat and sub-inspector of schools. He was appointed inspector of schools in 1892 (becoming the first black man to do so) and assistant colonial secretary for native affairs in 1900. In Lagos, Nigeria, he continued to progress doing much work on the Board of Education, serving as director of education between 1906 and 1918, and became the Resident of the Colony of Nigeria in 1918. He appears to be the first black man under British colonial rule to achieve this position.Boniface I. Obichere; Studies in Southern Nigerian History, Cass, 1982 Henry Carr was one of the few West Africans during the early twentieth century that broke barriers in colonial governance. Before the Second World War, few Africans rose beyond the position of chief clerk in colonial administration. While as the death rate of Europeans declined in west Africa, many expatriates came to the country and gained administrative positions, as the colonial officers readily accepted expatriates and helped advanced their careers, this situation further diminished the chances of West Africans to take more administrative responsibilities.Boniface I. Obichere; Studies in Southern Nigerian History, Cass, 1982. pp 170-240 Reasons given to limit the career advancement of Africans were the suspicions British officials had about Africans ethical disposition, due to an earlier embezzlement case in Ghana. However, this was a single case, and some critics questioned whether there were sinister motives behind the policy.

Feud with Herbert Macaulay It is unclear how the fierce hatred between Henry Carr and Herbert Macaulay developed however their disputes are well documented. Carr believed that Macaulay lacked integrity and was exploiting the House of Dosunmu for personal gain. In Carr's diaries, he writes of Macaulay \\"Among all human monsters with whom we have been brought into contact none has displayed the devilish ingenuity of this man\\", concluding that Macaulay was a \\"crooked mind and dangerous fool\\". Carr abhorred the political reality that Macaulay, who was barred from partaking in politics because of his criminal convictions, was a political kingmaker through Macaulay's control of the NNDP. The level of the strife between both men was so caustic that in 1924, Macaulay published a malicious account titled \\"Henry Carr Must Go\\". In the slanderous publication, Macaulay falsely asserted that Carr's father, Amuwo Carr deserted his wife to settle in Abeokuta as a polygamist. This was untrue considering Amuwo Carr died in Abeokuta of poor health and was nearly blind. Macaulay's vicious attacks on Carr in the press framed the Lagosian public's perception of Carr as shy, distant, and aloof. The Henry Carr library and Carr's contribution to education in Nigeria Like his political foe, Herbert Macaulay, Carr collected a voluminous collection of books (The Henry Carr Library), totaling 18,000 at his home called 'The Haven' in Tinubu Square, Lagos Island. Carr allowed school children within his residential vicinity to access his well- stocked library. Carr's 18,000 book library, according to Hope Rossiter, showed marks of personal selection. Rossiter further noted that Carr \\"represented simply the heights of achievement by an African of ability who through all his life had no material advantage that is not available to every young man in Nigeria...It was because Carr...used his wide education and tremendous culture as a background and not as a profession, that he is, in Africa, so outstanding. He is a perfect example of the cultured man - the quite well read, well-behaved and completely educated and cultivated man\\". Carr's library was acquired by the Nigerian government and the 18,000 book collection was sent to the University College, Ibadan (which would later become University of Ibadan), forming the foundation library at that institution. Carr also played an instrumental role in the set up of King's College Lagos. As Acting Director of Education with the British colonial government in Nigeria, Carr advised Governor Walter Egerton on the educational scheme to be implemented at King's College Lagos and convinced the London Board of Education that the institution was integral to Nigeria's development.

It matches the libraries on the user's computer, with those required by the program before compiling it from its source code. As a common practice, all configure scripts are named \`configure\`. Usually, configure scripts are written for the Bourne shell, but they may be written for execution in any desired shell.  Usage  Obtaining software directly from the source code is a common procedure on Unix computers, and generally involves the following three steps: configuring the makefile, compiling the code, and finally installing the executable to standard locations. A configure script accomplishes the first of these steps. Using configure scripts is an automated method of generating makefiles before compilation to tailor the software to the system on which the executable is to be compiled and run. The final executable software is most commonly obtained by executing the following commands in a shell that is currently pointing to the directory containing the source code: ./configure make make install One must type \`./configure\` rather than simply \`configure\` to indicate to the shell that the script is in the current directory. By default, for security reasons, Unix operating systems do not search the current directory for executables so one must give the full path explicitly to avoid an error. Upon its completion, \`configure\` prints a report to \`config.log\`. Running \`./configure --help\` gives a list of command line arguments, for enabling or disabling additional features such as: ./configure --libs=\\"-lmpfr -lgmp\\" ./configure --prefix=/home/user/local The first line includes the \`mpfr\` and \`gmp\` libraries. The second line tells \`make\` to install the final version in \`/home/user/local\`. Often, there is a file containing instructions should the prescribed steps fail. This file is commonly named \`INSTALL\`.  Generating \`configure\`  Software developers simplify the challenge of cross-platform software development by using GNU Autotools. These scripts query the system on which they run for environment settings, platform architecture, and the existence and location of required build and runtime dependencies. They store the gathered information in \`configure.ac\` or the now deprecated \`configure.in\` to be read by \`configure\` during the installation phase.  Dependency checking  In new development, library dependency checking has been done in great part using pkg-config via the m4 macro, PKG_CHECK_MODULES. Before pkg-config gained popularity, separate m4 macros were created to locate files known to be included in the distribution of libraries depended upon.  History  The first program to come with a configure script was rn by Larry Wall in 1984. The script was written by hand and produced a jocular running commentary when executed. It still survives as part of the build system of the trn program. Since then, an ecosystem of programs has grown up to automate the creation of configure scripts as far as possible, of which the most common is the GNU Autoconf system.

It is in the north- western suburbs of the town of Wrexham and comprises the wards of Grosvenor, Garden Village and Stansty. At the 2011 Census, the population of the community was 6,840 and 11.8% of people aged 3+ spoke Welsh. Administration Rhosddu was formed as a new ecclesiastical parish by an Order in Council in 1886. The parish contained the townships of Acton, Bieston and Gourton (from the parish of Wrexham), the township of Borras Riffri (from the parish of Gresford), and the township of Stansty (from the parish of Gwersyllt).Rhosddu, St James, GENUKI In 1972, Rhosddu reverted to the parish of Wrexham. The area of Rhosddu was in the civil parish of Stansty, which was part of the old Wrexham Municipal Borough. The administrative structures of the Municipal Borough were abolished in 1974, under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972. Rhosddu was created as one of the communities of Wrexham Maelor after a 1985 boundary review, which brought four new 'town' communities into being within the town of Wrexham itself (Rhosddu, Offa, Caia Park, and Acton).  History  'Abbotsfield' designed in the 1860s as the first house at the Rhosddu end of Grosvenor Road.The name Rhosddu is formed on the Welsh words rhos, \\"moor\\" or \\"rush pasture\\", and ddu, \\"black\\". The name may derive from the presence of coal and peat below the poorly drained surface as evidenced by old field names in the neighbouring Stansty area which indicate similar features e.g. 'Tirodd Duon' (black lands). It is likely that the area was common land in Medieval times used by tenants of the manor as rough pasture for cattle grazing. Rhosddu Farm (also known as Walnut Tree Farm) was first recorded in 1762 in the possession of the Griffiths family and was located on the site of the Walnut Tree public house on New Road. The first housing developments in the Rhosddu area began from 1856 following the arrival of the railway and the location of associated goods and carriage sheds in the area. The population increased further as a result of the Wrexham and Action Colliery which opened in the late 1860s. St James' church was built in Cefn sandstone to designs by W. Turner of Wrexham. The foundation was laid on 30 September 1874 and it was opened for worship in January 1876, although it was not consecrated until 27 April 1886. The church is now a Grade II Listed building, being considered a good example of a late 19th-century church retaining many original features.Church of St James, Rhosddu, Wrexham , Wrexham County Borough Council Rhosddu School (originally known as Stansty Park Board School) opened in 1877 and moved into its current premises on Price's Lane in 1915. Grosvenor Road Conservation Area is situated to the north west of the commercial town centre and incorporates Grosvenor Road, Grove Road and parts of Gerald Street, Regent Street, King Street, Grove Park Road, Rhosddu Road and part of the Coleg Cambria Campus.  Dissenters' Burying Ground  The Dissenters' Burying Ground on Rhosddu Road was originally a field of about one acre on land given to the Wrexham Nonconformists during the early 1600s by the Puritan Daniel Lloyd of Pen y Bryn Farm. The graveyard was probably laid out during the 1650s during the Interregnum period. By the mid-18th century, the graveyard was being used and maintained by the Baptist Church and, in 1788, an ongoing ownership dispute of the Ground was resolved allowing Presbyterians to be buried there upon payment of a fee to the Baptist Church. Hay was grown and sold to pay for a grave digger and other expenses.Palmer, A.N. 1888, A History of the Older Nonconformity of Wrexham and its Neighbourhood, Wrexham: Woodall Mishall and Thomas. During the night of the Wrexham races, in the mid-1840s, all but one of the brass memorial plates were stolen from the tombs, thus destroying many family histories.Palmer 1888,p.164 The last burial took place in 1901. When the Ground was closed to new burials in 1888, it contained 27 family vaults, a number of brick graves and 920 private family earthen graves.Price, G. V. 1951, The dissenters burial ground, Wrexham The graveyard was later landscaped and is now a public park. Many notable people are buried here including the great Puritan Morgan Llwyd (d.1659) and the ironmaster William Wilkinson (d.1808). Margaret Lloyd George unveiled a memorial to Morgan Llwyd in 1912.

The history of the New York Giants from 1925 to 1978 covers the American football franchise from the team's inception until the conclusion of their tumultuous 1978 season. Currently members of the NFL's National Football Conference, the Giants were founded in 1925 by original owner Tim Mara in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara gave control of the team over to his two sons‚ÄîWellington and Jack‚Äîearly in their lives. During this period in their history the Giants acquired four NFL championships, but also suffered some down times, including consecutive non- playoff seasons from 1964 to 1978. In just its third season, the team finished with the best record in the league at 11‚Äì1‚Äì1 and was awarded the NFL title. In a 14-year span from 1933 to 1946, New York qualified to play in the NFL championship game eight times, winning twice. They did not win another league title until 1956, aided by a number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players such as running back Frank Gifford, linebacker Sam Huff, and offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown. The Giants 1956 Championship team not only comprised players who would eventually find their way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but it also had a Hall of Fame coaching staff. Head coach Jim Lee Howell's staff had Vince Lombardi coaching the offense and Tom Landry coaching the defense. From 1958 to 1963, New York played in the NFL championship game five out of those six years, but failed to win. The 1958 NFL Championship game, in which they lost 23‚Äì17 in overtime to the Baltimore Colts, is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the United States. From 1964 to 1978, the Giants registered just two winning seasons and were unable to advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and end up in the Hall of Fame. This period was characterized by the front office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It was not until the 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team. Birth and success: 1925‚Äì1930 In 1925, the NFL was in need of a franchise in a large city market that could be used to showcase the league. To achieve this, NFL President, Joseph Carr traveled to New York City to offer boxing promoter Billy Gibson, a franchise. Gibson was chosen by Carr since he had owned the league's last New York franchise, the New York Brickley Giants, in 1921. However, Gibson refused the offer for a new franchise, but he did refer Carr to a friend of his, Tim Mara. Mara, a bookmaker (then a legal profession), businessman, and promoter, with an investment of US$500, then established the modern-day New York Giants franchise. Other than the name, there is no relation between the Brickley Giants and the modern New York Giants franchise.Walsh. pg. 100Schwartz. pg. 67 Mara decided to invest the $500 in the Giants as opposed to heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney in a spur-of-the-moment decision,Burke, Monte.

Legally named \\"New York Football Giants\\" to distinguish themselves from the baseball team of the same name, the Giants played their first game against All New Britain in New Britain, Connecticut, on October 4, 1925.New York First Game & First Home Game Program , hapmoran.org, accessed February 14, 2011.New York Pro Eleven Takes Opening Game, The New York Times, October 5, 1925, accessed March 16, 2007 They defeated New Britain 26‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 10,000. Tim Mara (seated on the left) pictured at the track. Before Mara founded the Giants, he worked as a bookmaker, a profession which was legal in 1925. Mara soon realized that his purchase of the team did not yield a home field nor any players, coaches, or equipment. Harry March, who was part of the group that convinced Mara to buy the team from the league, helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary. March guiding him through the team's early years, handling the personnel decisions. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring college stars such as Jim Thorpe.Gottehrer. pgs. 25‚Äì7, 45 At 37 years old, Thorpe was a shadow of his former self, and although he signed with the team, his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early portion of the season, until he got into shape, at which point he would play full games. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury.Gottehrer. pg. 28‚Äì9 His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.Gottehrer. pg. 30 Although the Giants were successful on the field in their first season, going 8‚Äì4 in 1925,New York Giants, footballreference.com, accessed November 2, 2010. their financial status was a different story. The players' salaries were so low that they could not fully dedicate themselves to the game as most of them had to work other jobs. The team's abbreviated practices, held at 4:30 PM each day so as not to conflict with work schedules, also allowed for little in-season improvement.Gottehrer. pgs. 27‚Äì8 Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. Mara had to spend $25,000 of his own money during the season just to keep the franchise alive. This struggle continued until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting more than 73,000 fans‚Äîa pro football record.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 52 The game attracted such attention that 20,000 fans were turned away at the gates.Watterson. pg. 154 This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered the history of the franchise.NFL History: 1921-1930 , NFL.com/history, accessed May 13, 2007.Carroll. pg. 126 New York went 8‚Äì4‚Äì1 in 1926, and withstood a challenge from an upstart American football league led by a team featuring Grange. Grange and his agent had formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. Grange's agent, C.C. Pyle, had tried to get the franchise admitted into the NFL using Yankee Stadium but was blocked by Mara, who asserted his territorial rights clause. Angered, Pyle swore revenge, saying \\"I am now ready to put the National Football League, and Mr. Mara out of business.\\"Gottehrer. pgs. 40‚Äì1 According to a story published by The New York Times in December 1926, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season.Pro Football Here to Stay, Says Mara; Giants to Play Next Year Despite Losses -- Game Also to Remain at Ebbets Field., The New York Times, December 19, 1926, accessed June 4, 2007. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL. Grange went back to playing for the Bears before the 1928 season, and the Yankees folded a year later.Gottehrer. pg. 49 The Giants had a very successful season in 1927, finishing 11‚Äì1‚Äì1.Championship games 1925-1949 , giants.com, accessed January 12, 2007.

New coach Earl Potteiger led the team into a game against the Chicago Bears late in the season with first place on the line. New York won 13‚Äì7 in what Owen called, \\"the toughest, roughest football game I ever played.\\"Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 69 From then on it was an easy trip to the championship,History of the New York Giants , giants.com, accessed January 12, 2007. as they had a 2-game lead over the Bears by virtue of their head to head tiebreaker (note: the championship was determined by record in that era; it was not until 1933 that the NFL had a championship game). Benny Friedman with the Giants Despite solid performances by linemen Hubbard and Steve Owen,Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 75 New York finished a disappointing 4‚Äì7‚Äì2 in 1928. Following the season, the team released 18 players and Potteiger was fired and replaced by LeRoy Andrews. Before the 1929 season Mara purchased the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, including star quarterback Benny Friedman, a team which had finished in third place the year before. The rosters of the two teams were combined under the Giants name and this led to immediate improvement as the Giants record soared to 13‚Äì1‚Äì1 in 1929.1941 New York Giants, football reference.com, October 5, 2010. Friedman's arrival in particular boosted tickets sales and fan interest, which more than covered the expense of his high salary ($10,000).Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 78 However, their only loss was a 20‚Äì6 defeat in November to the Green Bay Packers who by virtue of this win, and their 12‚Äì0‚Äì1 record, won the NFL title.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 79 That Packers team featured Hubbard who Green Bay had bought from New York after he expressed a desire to play there.Gottehrer. pg. 69 * Cal Hubbard signs with Bay Packers, The Milwaukee Journal, August 1, 1929, accessed December 3, 2010. Before the season, Mara had transferred ownership of the team over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors, and during the season the team added star Army halfback Red Cagle whose drawing power helped the team's financials, but whose performance did little to aid their on-field product.Gottehrer. pgs. 75‚Äì7, 97 In 1930, there were still many who questioned the quality of the professional game, claiming the college \\"amateurs\\" played with more intensity. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All Stars at the Polo Grounds to raise money for the unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the superiority of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with the stars of his 1930 Championship squad and told them to score early, then defend. Rockne, like much of the public, thought little of pro football and expected an easy win. But from the beginning it was a one way contest, with Friedman running for two Giant touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score, and New York played its backups in the second half. When it was all over, Coach Rockne told his team, \\"That was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad none of you got hurt.\\"Gottehrer. pgs. 79‚Äì83 The game raised $115,183 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game.Gottehrer. pg. 84 *Giants vs. Notre Dame, hapmoran.org, accessed February 14, 2011.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 83 Steve Owen era: 1931‚Äì1953 Following the 1930 season, Friedman retired to become an assistant coach at Yale, and the team hired lineman Steve Owen as the team's new head coach.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 88 Owen worked for Mara as a supervisor in his Harlem River area coalyard in the offseason.Gottehrer. pg. 93 Mara said that his leaderships skills displayed in that job earned him the top position.Gottehrer. pgs. 93‚Äì4 Owen was decidedly blue collar; he grew up on a farm in Oklahoma where he was raised by a \\"prairie schoolmarm and a Cherokee strip farmer\\", and spent his summer vacations in high school working as a roughneck in a Burkburnett, Texas oil field. An accomplished player who was noted for his toughness and physical strength, Owen had to learn on the job as a head coach.Gottehrer. pg. 95‚Äì6 He became an innovator who was responsible for introducing the A formation on offense, and the Umbrella defense, the latter of which helped the team control several high power passers during his tenure.

They rebounded in 1933 finishing 11‚Äì3, and narrowly losing to the Chicago Bears 23‚Äì21 in the championship game.1933 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, accessed March 20, 2007. New York's resurgence was led by some of the league's best linemen, such as Ray Flaherty, and future Hall of Famers Red Badgro, and Mel Hein.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 114 Hein, the team's center, was acquired in 1931, and also played the linebacker position.Pervin. pg. 8 He would go on to a fifteen-year NFL career in which, as a center, he became an All-NFL first team selection eight times, and the only offensive lineman ever named league MVP.Gottehrer. pg. 86 They also were aided by strong seasons from halfbacks Ken Strong, whose 64 points paced the team, and Kink Richards who averaged 6.8 yards per carry on the season. The Giants started 1‚Äì5‚Äì1 in 1932, leading Owen to re-enlist McBride, who had been recently released by the Brooklyn Dodgers for lax practice habits, as the team's starting quarterback. McBride restored them to respectability by leading the team to a 3‚Äì1‚Äì1 finish that season.Gottehrer. pgs. 98‚Äì9 Before the 1933 season the team acquired University of Michigan All-American quarterback Harry Newman, and versatile free agent halfback Ken Strong.Gottehrer. pg. 102‚Äì3 The Giants finished 11‚Äì3, first in the new \\"Eastern Division\\", and Newman, Hein, and Badgro were named first team All-NFL.

The New York fan base consisted of many Long Islanders and Fordham graduates who were eager to see Danowski play. Newman carried the ball a then-record 39 times in a 17‚Äì3 victory against Green Bay, but suffered a severe injury to his back in a late season game against Chicago, and his backup, Stu Clancy, was still out due to an elbow injury from a mid-season game.

Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and captain Ray Flaherty about the frozen field conditions. Flaherty suggested the Giants wear sneakers on the frozen field, as he had played in a game under similar circumstances at Gonzaga and the sneakers proved to be effective.Anderson, Dave. Sports of the Times; Wellington Mara Looks Back, The New York Times, December 31, 1985, accessed June 4, 2007. Mara dispatched equipment manager Abe Cohen to get as many sneakers as he could get.Blauss, Bill. The Title Wars, Chicago Tribune, October 4, 1986, accessed January 2, 2007. Due to traffic and the inability to find any athletic goods stores open on Sunday, Cohen was unable to return before the game started and New York, wearing conventional footwear, trailed 10‚Äì3 at the end of the first half. Realizing time was short, Cohen went to Manhattan College‚Äîwhere he had a key to the equipment and locker rooms‚Äîand returned to the Polo Grounds at halftime with nine pairs of basketball sneakers, saying that \\"nine pairs was all I could get.\\" Players donned the sneakers and the Giants, after allowing the Bears another field goal late in the third period, responded with 27 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. When they took the lead 17‚Äì13 on a touchdown run by Strong, the game had to be stopped because hundreds of fans ran onto the field to celebrate. The game would come to be known as \\"The Sneakers Game\\", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the fourth quarter set a single-quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades.

Fearing drunkenness, water was returned to their cups once the team had the lead,.Whittingham. pgs. 43‚Äì4 Before the 1935 season the NFL's roster limit was increased from 20 to 24 players.Gottehrer. pg. 126 The Giants filled the extra spots with players such as end Tod Goodwin, who played for coach Greasy Neale at West Virginia University the previous season, and running back Leland Shaffer, another rookie, this time out of Kansas State. Newman retired rather than come back from his back injury when the team refused to raise his salary.Gottehrer. pg. 124‚Äì5 Goodwin led the league in receptions (26) and yards per catch (16.6), while finishing second behind the Boston Redskins Charley Malone in receiving yards (433‚Äì432), and Danowski led the league in passing yards, passes attempted, and passes completed.1935 NFL Leaders, football-reference.com, accessed December 5, 2010.

Leemans had been with the Giants since 1936, when he led the league in rushing as a rookie with 830 yards.Frostino. pg. 24 A versatile performer, he rushed for over 3,000 yards, and passed for over 2,300 in his career. During the course of the game the stadium announcer paged Colonel William Joseph Donovan to answer a call from Washington, D.C., and told all servicemen to return to their units, but it was only when the game concluded that players and spectators learned of the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor earlier that day.Football and America: World War II, profootballhof.com, accessed May 31, 2007. New York advanced to the championship game following the season, in which they lost to the Bears 37‚Äì9. Both the 1940 and 1941 championship games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the games open late. In 1942 and 1943, the Giants totalled an 11‚Äì8‚Äì2 record and failed to make the postseason. In 1944, led by standout halfback Bill Paschal, whose 737 rushing yards and 54 points led the team, the Giants reached the championship game where they faced the Green Bay Packers for the third time in 10 seasons. They lost again, this time 14‚Äì7 as Ted Fritsch scored two touchdowns and the Packers defense was able to hold on to the lead despite a fourth-quarter touchdown by the Giants. Notable in this era was a game against the Detroit Lions on November 7, 1943 which ended in a scoreless tie,McDonough, W. et al. \\"75 Seasons: The Complete Story of the National Football League 1920‚Äì1995\\", Turner Publishing, Inc. and National Football League Properties, Atlanta, p. 86 (1994)The Detroit Free Press, November 8, 1943, p. 14The New York Times, November 8, 1943, p. 22 the last NFL game ever played to end this way.

NBC televised the Giants game versus the Green Bay Packers on September 20, 1946,‚Äîthe first televised game in league history.Fullerton. pg. 235 The Giants advanced to their eighth championship game in fourteen seasons, where they were beaten by the Sid Luckman led Bears 24‚Äì14. Before the 1948 season, New York signed defensive back Emlen Tunnell, who became the first African American player in team history,Emlen Tunnell, profootballhof.com, accessed October 5, 2010. and who would later become the first African American inducted into the Hall of Fame.Pellowski. pg. 28 They struggled from 1947 to 1949, never finishing above .500, but came back with a solid 10‚Äì2 record in 1950. However, they lost to the Cleveland Browns, whom they had beaten twice in the regular season, 8‚Äì3 in the 1950 divisional playoff game.1950 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, accessed March 20, 2007. In 1949, halfback Gene \\"Choo-Choo\\" Roberts scored a league high 17 touchdowns,Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 216 and in 1950 he set a team record that would stand for over 50 years, when he rushed for 218 yards on November 12.Lichtenstein. pg. 142 During this period quarterback Charlie Conerly emerged. Conerly was the team's starting quarterback from 1948 to 1960, and had a franchise-record string of 12 consecutive seasons in which he led the team in passing. A former US Marine, Conerly was renowned among his teammates for his toughness. \\"There was a time my rookie year when I really saw it\\", recalled running back Frank Gifford.Schwartz. pg. 135 \\"He broke his nose really badly, they literally called a timeout and then they called another one while they stopped the bleeding, they stuck stuff up there until it would stop bleeding. You try to get them to do that today. They'd be yelling, 'Get my agent!'\\". In 1951, the Giants finished 9‚Äì2‚Äì1, but their inability to beat division rival Cleveland cost them an opportunity to play in the Championship Game.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 230 Fullback Eddie Price led the league in rushing and set a league record for rushing attempts in a season, and defensive linemen Arnie Weinmeister and Al DeRogatis, linebacker Jon Baker, and offensive tackle Tex Coulter all made the All-Pro team. The following year New York fell to 7‚Äì5, but Tunnell continued to impress. \\"Tunnell returned interceptions, punts, and kickoffs with such electric flair that he actually outgained the league rushing leader in yards gained\\" according to one publication.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 236 Tunnell amassed 924 yards, while never lining up on offense, whereas the league rushing leader totalled 894. The Giants offense struggled in 1953,Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 242 and they fell to a 3‚Äì9 record.New York Giants franchise history, footballreference.com, accessed November 1, 2010. Gifford was forced to play both ways due to a depleted roster, and in the second to last game of the season they lost 62‚Äì14 to division rival Cleveland. Jim Lee Howell and the Hall of Famers: 1954‚Äì1958 Following the 1953 season, an important transition in Giants history occurred. Steve Owen was fired by Wellington and Jack Mara, and replaced by Jim Lee Howell.1955 New York Giants, footballreference.com, accessed October 5, 2010. Owen had coached the Giants for 23 seasons, and compiled a 153‚Äì108‚Äì17 record.New York Giants, profootballhof.com, accessed June 2, 2007. He is credited with introducing several innovations to football, including inventing the \\"Umbrella defense\\", which was the first to use four defensive backs.Flores. pg. 71 Wellington, who was beginning to take a more active role in the team by this period, later described the move by calling it \\"the hardest decision I'd ever made\\".Schwartz. pg. 95 The change would have a profound impact on Gifford. A multi-talented player who could run, catch, and throw, Gifford was a star at the University of Southern California as a quarterback and runner, and while at the school he had bit parts in some Hollywood films.Pervin. pg. 20‚Äì1 After clashing with Owen, whom he considered a taskmaster, and inspiring jealousy in some of his teammates who despised his \\"glamour boy\\" status, Gifford thrived under Howell. Lombardi switched him from defensive back, where he was already a pro bowl performer, to halfback, and Gifford made seven pro bowls at the position.Pervin. pg. 22 The Giants went 7‚Äì5 in 1954 under Howell. In their thirty-first and final season playing their home games at the Polo Grounds in 1955, they went 5‚Äì1‚Äì1 over their final seven games to finish 6‚Äì5‚Äì1. They were led by the rejuvenated Gifford who played the entire season solely on offense for the first time in several years.Neft, Cohn, and Korch. pg. 254 The Giants won their fourth NFL Championship in 1956. Playing their home games at Yankee Stadium for the first time, New York won the Eastern Division with an 8‚Äì3‚Äì1 record. In the NFL Championship Game on an icy field against the Chicago Bears, the Giants wore sneakers as they had 22 years previous. They dominated the Bears winning the championship by a score of 47‚Äì7. The 1956 Giants featured a number of future Hall of Fame players, including 1956 league MVP Gifford, Sam Huff, and Roosevelt Brown. Equally notable, the team featured as its coordinators future Hall of Fame head coaches Tom Landry (defense) and Vince Lombardi (offense). Combined, the pair would later win 7 NFL championships as head coaches. Howell wisely let his assistants do most of the coaching, and acted mostly as an administrator.Baker & Corbett. pg. 36 During his time in New York, Landry (who had been a defensive back for the team) invented the 4-3 defense.Sports of The Times; Landry Was in Control As Cowboys' Coach, The New York Times, February 13, 2000, accessed November 23, 2010. *Fitzgerald, Tommy. Defenses Changing -- Tom Landry, The Miami News, March 23, 1959, accessed November 23, 2010. This unit, led by middle linebacker Huff and defensive end Andy Robustelli, is credited with \\"bringing status to the defensive side of the ball\\", and Giants' fans of this particular team are credited with inventing the \\"De-fense\\" chant.Hanlon, Greg. Top 10 Moments in the Giants-Cowboys Rivalry, The New York Times, December 14, 2008, accessed November 23, 2010. Landry used Huff in his middle linebacker position to key in on star Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, and this was most effective in a 1958 playoff game where New York held Brown to eight yards in a victory.Pervin. pg. 25 In addition, those Giants featured Gifford, Kyle Rote, and Pat Summerall, who would go on to highly successful second careers as football announcers. In 1957, the Giants lost their final three games to compile a 7‚Äì5 record,1957 New York Giants, pro-football-reference.com, accessed March 20, 2007. finishing second in the NFL's Eastern Division to Cleveland.1957 Standings, pro-football-reference.com, accessed March 20, 2007. The Greatest Game Ever Played: 1958 The Giants had another successful year in 1958. They tied for the Eastern Division regular season title with a 9‚Äì3 record,1958 New York Giants , databasefootball.com,accessed March 17, 2007. and beat the Cleveland Browns 10‚Äì0 in a one-game playoff to determine the division winner. In the victory they held Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown to a career low eight yards rushing.Schwartz. pg. 24 They then played in the NFL Championship Game against the Baltimore Colts on December 28, 1958, in front of 64,185 fans at Yankee Stadium.Championship Games 1950‚Äìpresent , giants.com, accessed January 12, 2007. This game, which would become known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\", was a watershed event in the history of the NFL and marked the beginning of the rise of football into the dominant sport in the American market.Sandomir, Richard. The ‚ÄòGreatest Game‚Äô in Collective Memory, The New York Times, December 4, 2008, accessed October 5, 2010.Buckley Jr. pg. 10 * \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" remembered 40 years later , NFL.com, December 15, 1998 accessed June 1, 2007. The game itself was highly competitive. New York got off to a quick 3‚Äì0 lead; however Baltimore scored two touchdowns to take a 14‚Äì3 halftime advantage.Baltimore Colts at New York Giants - December 28th, 1958, footballreference.com, accessed October 5, 2010. Late in the third quarter, the Colts appeared ready to put the game out of reach by driving deep into Giants' territory. However, they were stopped and turned the ball over on downs.Buckley Jr. pg. 11 This would be a turning point of the game, as the Giants, who had trouble mounting many drives to that point, came back with a 95‚Äìyard drive. The key play of the drive was Conerly's pass to Kyle Rote, who after a 62‚Äìyard gain, fumbled at the Colts' 25‚Äìyard line, where Alex Webster picked up the ball and ran it to the 1‚Äìyard line. New York then scored a touchdown, to make the score 14‚Äì10. The Giants drove again, with quarterback Charley Conerly throwing a 15‚Äìyard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17‚Äì14.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 272 With just over two minutes left the Giants punted the ball to the Colts, pinning them on their own 14 yard line. The Colts put together one last, desperate drive. The star of this drive was receiver Raymond Berry, who caught three passes for 62 yards, the last one for 22 yards to the Giant 13‚Äìyard line. With seven seconds left in regulation, Steve Myhra kicked a 20‚Äìyard field goal to tie the score 17‚Äì17, sending the game to overtime for the first time in NFL history. After winning the toss and receiving the ball, the Giants offense stalled and was forced to punt. From their own 20, the Colts drove the ball down the field, with Alan Ameche finally scoring from the 1‚Äìyard line to give the championship to the Colts, 23‚Äì17. More success: 1959‚Äì1963 The Giants enjoyed a run of success over the next several years. Led by league MVP quarterback Charlie Conerly, who passed for 1,706 yards, 14 touchdowns, and four interceptions, they finished 9‚Äì3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch.1959 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, accessed March 16, 2007. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31‚Äì16. Conerly struggled with age and injuries in 1960, and was replaced by George Shaw. Gifford was concussed in a vicious hit by Chuck Bednarik during a November game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the rest of the season, and the following season, as a result.Flatter, Ron. More Info on Chuck Bednarik, espn.com, November 19, 2003, accessed November 30, 2010. The hit was so devastating, that after being taken to the locker room, Gifford was given his last rites.Pervin. pg. 23 The team still finished with a winning record at 6‚Äì4‚Äì2,1960 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, accessed March 19, 2007. but were led to acquire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Y. A. Tittle in the offseason. Led by Tittle and new head coach Allie Sherman, New York won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961 to 1963. In 1961, they were beaten by the Packers, 37‚Äì0 in the championship game. In 1962, they went into the championship game with a 12‚Äì2 record, and a nine-game winning streak; but lost to the Packers again, 16‚Äì7. Nonetheless, the Giants had captivated New York by this time, even though the sold-out game was played in single-digit weather with 35 mph winds, only 299 of the 65,000+ fans who bought tickets stayed home.Gottehrer. pg. 19‚Äì20 Before the 1962 season, Gifford came out of his injury-forced retirement, saying he missed the game too much. He changed positions from halfback to flanker.Walsh. pg. 155 During the season, Tittle and wide receiver Del Shofner set still-standing team records when Tittle threw for seven touchdowns and Shofner amassed 269 receiving yards in the same game on October 28. After the season, the team traded two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Roosevelt Grier to the Los Angeles Rams at his request; Grier wanted to move to LA to start his singing career.Pervin. pg. 49 Led by league MVP Tittle, who passed for over 3,000 yards and 36 touchdowns,YA Tittle , databasefootball.com, accessed May 29, 2007. the Giants had an 11‚Äì3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's record for most points in a 14-game season by scoring 448.Baker & Corbett. pg. 85 They advanced to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle in the first half (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half.Schwartz. pg. 155Baker & Corbett. pgs. 96‚Äì98 Sherman however, had little alternative. \\"The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'\\" Sherman recalled.Schwartz. pg. 156 \\"We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him.\\" The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14‚Äì10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14‚Äì0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. \\"I was alone in the end zone‚Äîball right into my hands, nobody around me‚Äîand I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14‚Äì0.\\"Baker & Corbett. pgs. 93‚Äì94 On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line.Baker & Corbett. pg. 94 Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.Baker & Corbett. pg. 95 New York's run of championship game appearances combined with their large-market location translated into financial success. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS‚Äîfour times as much as small-market Green Bay, which was one of the most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would be in the best interest of the NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the league.King, Peter. A Giant legacy, Sports Illustrated, October 31, 2005, accessed December 14, 2010. * King, Peter. NFL loses a guiding light, Sports Illustrated, October 25, 2005, accessed December 14, 2010. Wilderness years begin: 1964‚Äì1972 After the 1963 season, the team fell apart. Partly due to trades but also due to poor drafting. Sherman traded away key players on the team's defense ‚Äî such as Huff and defensive tackle Dick Modzelewski ‚Äî which was their strongest unit, and Wellington Mara, who came in the 1960s with a reputation as a shrewd judge of talent, exited the decade carrying a sub-par one according to a writer for New York magazine.Axthelm. pg. 50 * Maule, Tex. A Successful Trader In Giants, Sports Illustrated, November 20, 1961, accessed December 14, 2010. Modzelewski went on to make the pro bowl in Cleveland in 1964, while Huff did the same in Washington.Dick Modzelewski, football-reference.com, accessed November 29, 2010.* Sam Huff, football-reference.com, accessed November 29, 2010. First round draft choices such as running backs Joe Don Looney, Tucker Frederickson, and Rocky Thompson were disappointments.Pervin. pgs. 48‚Äì50 Frederickson was selected as the first overall draft choice in 1965 (over Hall of Famers Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers), but never rushed for more than 659 yards in a season during his injury-shortened career.Pervin. pg. 51Tucker Frederickson, football-reference.com, accessed November 29, 2010. This period in team history is often referred to as \\"the wilderness years\\". The Week two game of the 1964 season was played in Pittsburgh. Tittle was brutally tackled by Steelers defensive end John Baker during the second quarter. It was here that Morris Berman, a photographer for the Pittsburgh Gazette, snapped a now famous picture of the injured quarterback kneeling on the ground with blood running down his scalp.Shapiro, Michael. Fallen Giant, Smithsonian, February 2007, accessed November 29, 2010. Tittle spent that night in a hospital, then returned to play the following week. But it was clear that he was not the same player, and the Giants finished with a disappointing 2-10-2 record. Tittle retired the following summer, and in 1971 was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Following the season Gifford and Alex Webster announced their retirement, and Jack Mara, who had been President of the team for since he was 22, died at the age of 57.Associated Press. Jack Mara dies at 57, Daytona Beach Morning Journal, June 30, 1965, accessed November 1, 2010. The team rebounded with a 7‚Äì7 record in 1965, before compiling a league-worst 1‚Äì12‚Äì1 record in 1966, with their defense setting a new league record by allowing over 500 points.Pervin. pg. 631966 NFL Standings, Stats and Awards , databasefootball.com, accessed March 17, 2007. This season also included a 72‚Äì41 loss1966 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, accessed March 17, 2007. to the rival Redskins at D.C. Stadium in the highest-scoring game in league history. Interest in the team was waning, especially with the rise of the AFL's New York Jets, who featured a wide-open style of play and a charismatic young quarterback in Joe Namath.Axthelm. pgs. 45, 47 The Yale Bowl was the site of the Giants first meeting with the Jets in 1969, and later served as their home for parts of two seasons. Looking to improve their on- field product, and also to find a player with talent and star power to better compete with the Jets for New York fans' affections, the Giants acquired quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season and showed improvement.Pervin. pg. 54 They finished 7‚Äì7 in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. In those seasons, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl by amassing over 2,200 yards and 21 touchdowns.Homer Jones, football-reference.com, accessed November 30, 2010. The team also upset the division champion Dallas Cowboys 27‚Äì21 in one of their biggest wins in years, and the Giants' jubilant players carried Sherman off the field on their shoulders. After the game, Wellington Mara said he expected Sherman to remain the team's coach for several more seasons,Pervin. pg. 58 however, after starting 7‚Äì3 they lost their final four games.Schwartz. pg. 103 During the 1969 preseason, the Giants lost their first meeting with the Jets, 37‚Äì14, in front of 70,874 fans at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut.Wallace, William M.

Three weeks later, Wellington Mara fired Sherman,Schwartz. pg. 104 and replaced him with former Giants fullback Alex Webster. Sherman was a lax disciplinarian, who Gifford later said \\"wanted to be loved and that's deadly for a coach.\\" The firing was welcomed by fans: a writer from The New York Times commented, \\"[t]he Giants last winning season was 1963 and since then the fans's sing-song chant \\"Good- by Allie!\\" has mounted to a crescendo.\\"Weinraub, Bernard. Fans Show Mixed Emotions; Bad Trades Laid to Team's Pilot, The New York Times, September 13, 1969, accessed March 18, 2007. On opening day of the 1969 regular season, Tarkenton led the Giants to a 24‚Äì23 victory over his former team, the Vikings, by throwing two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter.Vecsey, George.

New York finished 6‚Äì8 in the 1969 season under Webster. In 1970, Tarkenton's fourth with the Giants, New York showed marked improvement, fielding their most competitive team since 1963. After an 0‚Äì3 start the Giants won 9 out of their next 10,1970 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, accessed March 17, 2007. and went into their season finale against the Los Angeles Rams with a chance to win the NFC East Division. Though New York took an early 3‚Äì0 lead, the Rams scored the next 31 points, dashing the Giants hopes and leaving them out of the playoffs. Tarkenton had his best season as a Giant in 1970 and made the Pro Bowl. Much of the team's success was credited to him. Teammate Fred Dryer later commented, \\"[w]ithout Tarkenton, I don't think we would have won any games.\\"Fran Tarkenton, scout.com, accessed March 18, 2007. Running back Ron Johnson also made the Pro Bowl and ran for 1,027 yards, becoming the first Giant ever to gain 1,000 yards rushing in a season,Associated Press. Giants Star Is Lost For Rest Of Season, Reading Eagle, November 16, 1971, accessed October 5, 2010. and Webster was named NFL Coach of the Year. Meanwhile, the Jets, much as the Giants had in 1964, fell apart, dropping to a 4‚Äì10 record after several consecutive seasons of success, with Namath breaking his wrist in a Super Bowl III rematch with the Baltimore Colts and missing the final eight games. New York was unable to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 training camp in a salary dispute, before coming back a few days later after signing a one-year contract.Pervin. pg. 55 In place of a salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get a tax break, but the Maras turned it down, and made sure the press knew the raise and loan were denied.Axthelm. pg. 47 Johnson missed most of the season with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4‚Äì10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings.Pervin. pgs. 55‚Äì6 Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8‚Äì6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career.Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 532 They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals.Philadelphia Eagles 10 at New York Giants 62, footballreference.com, accessed November 1, 2010. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume. Leaving New York: 1973‚Äì1978 Desiring their own home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an agreement with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium.Amdur, Neil. Pride of New Jersey: Stadium Designed for Comfort of Fans; Giants Stadium, Built for Comfort Of Fans, Is Pride of New Jersey, The New York Times, October 10, 1976, accessed May 12, 2007. The stadium, which would be known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. As the complex was being built, and their current home at Yankee Stadium was being renovated, they would be without a home for three years. Their final full season at Yankee Stadium was 1972. After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played the rest of their home games in 1973, as well as all of their home games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut.The Giants Stadiums , giants.com/history, accessed May 12, 2007. This was done out of a desire to have their own home field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets.Sprechman and Shannon. pg. 286 However, between access problems, neighborhood issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914) and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision and ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven home games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a home record of 1‚Äì11 over that two-year stretch.Year by Year results (1973-1978) (PDF), giants.com/history, accessed May 12, 2007. After the 1973 season the team fired Webster, who later admitted his heart was never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as the architect of the Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships.Pervin. pgs. 63‚Äì4 Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton in the middle of the 1974 season.Pervin. pg. 60 One of the bright spots in this era was the play of tight end Bob Tucker who, from 1970 through part of the 1977 season was one of the top tight ends in the NFL.

However, the season imploded on November 19, 1978, in one of the most improbable finishes in NFL history. Playing their archrival the Philadelphia Eagles the Giants were leading 17‚Äì12 and had possession of the ball with only 30 seconds left.Katz, Michael. 20 Seconds Left As Eagles Win; Jets Bow; Todd Reinjured, The New York Times, November 20, 1978, accessed March 18, 2007. They had only to kneel the ball to end the game, as the Eagles had no time outs. However, instead of kneeling the ball, offensive coordinator Bob Gibson ordered Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik to run play \\"pro 65 up\\", which was designed to hand the ball off to fullback Larry Csonka. Pisarcik never gained control of the ball after the snap however, and gave a wobbly handoff to Csonka. \\"I never had control of the ball\\" Pisarcik later recalled. It rolled off Csonka's hip and bounced free. Eagles safety Herman Edwards picked up the loose ball and ran, untouched, for a score, giving the Eagles an improbable 19‚Äì17 victory. After the game Giants coach John McVay stated \\"[t]hat's the most horrifying ending to a ball game I've ever seen.\\" This play is referred to as \\"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\\" among Eagles fans, and \\"The Fumble\\" among Giants fans. In the aftermath of the defeat, Gibson was fired (the next morning). New York lost three out of their last four games to finish 6-10 and out the playoffs for the 15th consecutive season, leading them to let McVay go as well. Two games after \\"The Fumble\\", angry Giants fans burned tickets in the parking lot. Protests continued throughout the remainder of the season, reaching a crescendo in the final home game. A group of fans hired a small plane to fly over the stadium on game day carrying a banner that read: \\"15 years of Lousy Football ‚Äî We've Had Enough.\\" Fans in the stadium responded, chanting \\"We've had enough...We've had enough\\" after the plane flew overhead.Pervin. pg. 48 The game had 24,374 no-shows, and fans hanged an effigy of Wellington Mara in the Stadium parking lot.The 5th down, The New York Times, June 3, 2007, reprints of various articles, accessed June 3, 2007.

Drawing set The principal information provided in set of blueprint drawings are as follows: * Site plans are drawn to show the location of a home on the property in its context. It is an overhead view of the construction site and the home as it sits in reference to the boundaries of the lot. Site plans should outline location of utility services, setback requirements, easements, location of driveways and walkways, and sometimes even topographical data that specifies the slope of the terrain. *A floor plan is an overhead view of the completed house. On the plan, you will see parallel lines that scale at whatever width the walls are required to be. Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans will also indicate rooms, all the doors and windows and any built-in elements, such as plumbing fixtures, cabinets, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans will include notes to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items. *Elevations are a non- perspective view of the home. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Plans include front, rear and both side elevations. The elevations specify ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches and other details that are necessary to give the home its exterior architectural styling. *A section cuts through the dwelling and the location of this 'cut through' is noted on the floor plan. It describes how the building will be constructed and discusses how the internal finishes are to look. Sections are used because they explain certain conditions in more detail. These conditions may include ceiling height, ceiling type (flat or vault), and window and door dimensions. * Foundation plan, including dimensions and locations for footings. * Framing plan, for wall, including the size of the lumber to be used - usually 2x4 or 2x6. * The Sub-floor Plan gives details of how this area will be constructed and how services will be arranged. * Roof plans, including type, pitch and framing. * Interior elevation drawings (interior walls). * Detail drawings, such as built-in shelving, moldings, and columns. * Schedules for elements such as windows and doors. * Structural layouts. * Electrical and telecoms drawings: show locations of all the outlets, TV sockets, switches and fixtures. Also indicates which switches operate which lights, and where the electric lines should be run,. * Plumbing schematic drawing: plumbing fixtures and piping. * Subdivision plans also known as an allotment plans or Strata plans. Show information regarding adjoining properties.  Lines and symbols  House plans use the following lines and symbols to convey the relationship between objects: * Dimension lines, which consist of a solid line with a mark at either end; space between the two marks equals the distance noted next to the line. * Wall, thick solid lines between rooms are used to indicate a wall. * Partial height wall, a low wall that doesn't extend all the way up to the ceiling. * Thin solid lines are used for built-in structures (such as cabinets, bookshelves, or plumbing fixtures). * Thin dotted lines indicate overhead features, such as wall cabinets in a kitchen or a special ceiling treatment or an archway in the living room. * North arrow * Doors: ** Door swing ** Bifold doors ** Passage (hinged) doors ** Sliding glass door ** French door * Window, small breaks between exterior walls often indicate a window * Toilet, often indicated as a circle adjacent to a rectangle in the bathroom * Bathtub, often indicated as a large oval or rectangle when indicating a tub/shower combination * Shower, a rectangular or square shape with an X running through it * Bathroom sink, a rectangle with an oval and a dot in the center if it is a single vanity. * Kitchen sink * Kitchen range * Refrigerator, a small square with 'ref.' worded on it to signify the location placement of the refrigerator * Washer/Dryer * Tree * Shrub  Spaces and rooms  House plans generally include the following features, depending on the size and type of house: * Bedroom * Bathroom * Kitchen * Hall *Laundry room *Living room (as known as a great room or family room)  Open floor plan  An open floor plan is one which values wide, unenclosed spaces. They are made possible by curtain wall technology, engineered lumber and truss systems, and thoughtful structural design which allow for larger clear-spans than formerly possible in residential construction. An open floor plan limits or excludes walls separating the main living areas of the house (living room, dining room, kitchen) to allow for entertaining or interaction between family.

The formerly self- administering communities of Keilberg, Stra√übessenbach and Oberbessenbach merged into a greater community in 1978, taking on the historical name of Bessenbach once again. The local noble family, also called Bessenbach, were instrumental in the community's development. Their ancestral seat, a castle, stood in today's centre of Keilberg. The family's existence is documented as far back as the 12th century. They had lordly and juridical rights throughout the Bessenbach valley that they alienated in the late 13th century. The family arms ‚Äì the two-headed stork ‚Äì were later adopted as the charge in the community's arms.

Geography=Location Constituent communities Geiselbach lies on the Hesse-Bavaria boundary, 20 km north of Aschaffenburg and 50 km east of Frankfurt am Main. Elevations in the community reach from 272 m above sea level at the church up to 381 m at the Ziegelberg. The municipal area comprises 535 ha in the constituent community of Geiselbach and 415 ha in the constituent community of Omersbach. History In 1269, Geiselbach had its first documentary mention in a purchase agreement between the Seligenstadt Monastery and the Archbishopric of Mainz, between Abbot Conrad and Archbishop Werner. There also exists an earlier document from 1250 in which was about a dispute between the brothers Friedrich and Heinrich von Rannenberg and Reinhard von Hanau about holdings and rights in Geiselbach. After 1269, the Seligenstadt Monastery relinquished its rights in Geiselbach to the noble families of B√ºdingen, Hanau and Rannenberg and to the knight Erpho von Orb. In 1278, the patrician from Gelnhausen Irmgard Ungef√ºge took over the Geiselbach Vogtei with the villages of Geiselbach, Omersbach and Hofst√§dten. In three documents from 25 May 1278 it was agreed between the Seligenstadt Abbey and Madam Irmgard that the Abbey could reacquire all rights from her in better times. Even before the turn of the century, in 1290, Sir Erpho von Orb was once again named the Vogt in Geiselbach. The Seligenstadt Monastery held the lordship over Geiselbach until Secularization in 1802. Most of the villages of the upper Kahlgrund then passed to the Principality of Aschaffenburg. Geiselbach, on the other hand, as a Seligenstadt Monastery holding, passed into ownership of the Landgrave of Hesse, who moved the Vogtei administration from Geiselbach to Seligenstadt. In 1811, the three villages were united with the Grand Ducal Hessian Amt in Alzenau, which itself became Bavarian in 1816. In 1972 the formerly self-administering community of Omersbach was amalgamated with Geiselbach, while the community of Hofst√§dten, which had likewise belonged to the Vogtei of Geiselbach, passed to Sch√∂llkrippen in 1978. Coat of arms The community‚Äôs arms might be described thus: Gules an uppercase A with crossbar on top in fess and cross stroke in chevron inverted Or among three mullets of six argent. The community of Geiselbach was acquired in 1296 by the Seligenstadt Monastery from the Archbishopric of Mainz for an undisclosed price. It thereby belonged along with the two neighbouring villages of Hofst√§dten and Omersbach to the Vogtei of the Dreid√∂rfer (‚ÄúThree Villages‚Äù) over which the monastery managed to get the landlordship and the low jurisdiction through the acquisition. The big A (Abbatio) in the arms is the charge borne by the Seligenstadt Monastery and refers to the monastery‚Äôs lordship until Secularization in 1802. The three mullets (stars) symbolize the three-village parish. The tinctures silver and red are Electoral Mainz‚Äôs colours and recall Mainz‚Äôs lordship until 1803.

Out of one such settlement grew the village of Glattbach over the course of the centuries (earlier known as Gladebach and also Gladbach). It might have got its name from the goldlike glittering in the local stone found on the banks and on the bed of the brook (glad meant ‚Äúglittering‚Äù, and Bach is German for ‚Äúbrook‚Äù). The economic relationships were quite humble; obligatory service, tithe payments and debts thwarted any growth. The only wealth came with the vineyards, which lay on the sunny south and southwest slopes. Cadastral names such as Wingert unterm Dorf, Wingert oberm Dorf and Am hei√üen Stein still recall the local winegrowing today. Since Glattbacher wine was known to be good, it led to Count Sch√∂nborn owning a vineyard here. After many bad harvests, the vines were torn up in the late 18th century, and instead intensive fruitgrowing began. This specifically involved cherries. In industry, linen weaving was strongly represented. In 1832, seventeen linen weavers appeared in the old community books. The endless sharing out of estates under Electoral Mainz inheritance law meant that the area of land available for each farmer to work was forever shrinking. While only ten families shared the 310 ha municipal area in 1661, by the mid 18th century there were 50 neighbours (or Nachbarn, as residents were called, as opposed to those who had moved to the community and therefore neither owned land nor had rights) who had to eke out their lives from the soil. The only major property, with 97 Morgen (somewhat less than 200 000 m¬≤), was the herrschaftliches H√∂fchen (‚ÄúManorial Estate‚Äù), which passed to Kollegiatsstift St Peter und Alexander from noble ownership as a donation in 1334, later being bestowed by the STift upon various country noblemen. Later still, it passed to the liege lord, the Elector of Mainz, and eventually ‚Äì about 1837 ‚Äì it was sold into private ownership to the landed family Heeg. About 1800, the old Hofreith was torn down, and across the road a major estate with an oil and tobacco mill and a wine press was built, today known as the Helmshof. The village's location in a secluded dale meant that there was never any through traffic. Nevertheless, in no way was Glattbach spared the hardship and war that time and again beset the Lower Main area. This may well have had something to do with the village's lying right near the town of Aschaffenburg, or perhaps it was the Gelnh√§user Stra√üe, an old army and trade road running by Glattbach to the west, which led up to the Johannesberger H√∂he (heights). Warlike peoples came plundering, burning and murdering their way through the village, bringing the population hardship and misery. Frightful pestilences took a heavy toll on the people. After the Thirty Years' War only ten families out of what had been 33 were still alive, and 20 houses had vanished from the earth. Many times the people fled before the soldiers. In 1743, when the English were plundering the whole community from 18 to 26 June, the population fled, hiding out in the Spessart forests. In the war's wake came further sickness. The grimmest Plague years, 1606 and 1636, are today still remembered by two Bildst√∂cke (sing. Bildstock ‚Äì a cross-shaped or columnar pillar functioning as a wayside shrine), called Peststeine (‚ÄúPlague stones‚Äù), on the main road. In the time of greatest hardship, the population vowed to hold a festival and repentance day ‚Äúfor everlasting time‚Äù if the sickness came to an end. On this so-called Hellfeiertag (roughly ‚ÄúLight Holiday‚Äù ‚Äì despite the similarity in pronunciation, there is no connection with ‚Äúhellfire‚Äù), the Friday before Michaelmas, it was forbidden to light a fire in any hearth, and both people and livestock observed a strict fast and did no work. The vow was strictly kept right up until the First World War. As early as the 12th century, Glattbach was mentioned as a branch of Saint Agatha's parish at Aschaffenburg. There is, however, no mention of a church until the 17th century. In 1682, a chapel in Saint Nicholas's honour was built, and consecrated by the Capuchin priest Martin von Cochem, a famous repentance preacher and folk writer. At that time, the community had some 180 to 200 inhabitants. The chapel stood with its graveyard and schoolhouse on the lot now occupied by the church. The chapel was not standing very long. Already by 1727, a new church was being built there, the Magdalenenkirchlein (roughly ‚ÄúMary Magdalene‚Äôs Little Church‚Äù). It was built in the astonishingly short time of four months. Services were held only once a month, on a weekday. Only from 1775 onwards does it seem that there were services on Sunday ‚Äì and even then only over the winter ‚Äì mostly given by a Capuchin priest. In 1890, a local chaplaincy was instituted, which was raised to parish on 14 December 1922. Ten clergy worked as local chaplains in Glattbach. The first parish priest was Christian Benz from Weibersbrunn, who held this post for 25 years before he died in an accident on 20 December 1948. In 1899 the Magdalenenkirchlein was torn down. Building work then began on today's Gothic Revival parish church, Maria Himmelfahrt (‚ÄúAssumption of Mary‚Äù), which was consecrated on 15 August 1901. There were some 700 Catholic parishioners in those days. Already by about 1730, there was school in Glattbach. The schoolmasters were until far into the 19th century craftsmen who pursued teaching only as a sideline, or who employed helpers to do it. The oldest known schoolhouse stood behind the Magdalenenkirchlein and contained not only a schoolroom and a teacher's dwelling, but also a communal room. In 1878 the second schoolhouse was built, which at the time was one of the finest for a great distance. Since 1986 it has served as the town hall, after the elementary school had moved to the new building auf dem Schwalbesgraben, one wing in 1958, and the other in 1964. The industrialization of the 19th century and the great splintering of land ownership by inheritances that were endlessly carving plots into smaller ones brought about the community's first structural shift from purely a farming village to a workers‚Äô village. A man from Glattbach, a tailor named Johann Desch born in 1848, while in his shop hit on the idea of sewing suits by standard measurements ahead of time and having the sewing done by workers in their homes. These first ready-to-wear suits sold briskly in the growing industrial towns of Hanau, Frankfurt and Offenbach. The business quickly swelled, and Johann Desch bought a house in Aschaffenburg. In 1874, he had the first men's clothing factory entered into the town's commercial registry. This branch of industry in the Aschaffenburg area that was once so important had its cradle in that tailor's shop in Glattbach. In the Second World War, the village suffered greatly under the bombings in 1944 and 1945. Fourteen people were killed in these raids, and more than a hundred buildings were utterly or partly destroyed, among them the kindergarten and the gymnasium. After the war, reconstruction was implemented through brisk building activity and a heavy inflow of inhabitants. Beginning then, Glattbach became a residential community with nearly 3,800 inhabitants, favoured by its proximity to the town and its scenically charming location. The inhabitants are mostly commuters who overwhelmingly have jobs in Aschaffenburg.

It has a population of around 8,300. Geography=Location Constituent communities The community lies east-south-east of the town of Aschaffenburg on the western edge of the Spessart (range) between the town and the hills' well-known landmark Mespelbrunn Castle. The highest elevations in the municipal area are the Findberg and the Buchberg. They reach some 330 m above NHN. Haibach is located in the Spessart Nature Park (Naturpark Spessart) Municipal territory The municipal area can be divided into the \\"village\\", a development area and an industrial area. The village (Dorf) accounts for the biggest part of Haibach and lies to the north. Buildings there are mainly older terraced houses, not higher than two floors. Here, too, is the community centre consisting of the church, various grocery shops and the fire station. On a hill lies Haibach's development area, which consists of larger detached new structures. The industrial area lies on W√ºrzburger Stra√üe/State Road 2312 (formerly the B 8) to the south. Found there are the industrial parts of the community, like Adler Modem√§rkte GmbH. The constituent communities of Gr√ºnmorsbach and D√∂rrmorsbach are located in the south. D√∂rrmorsbach is found at the foot of the Pfaffenberg, whose distinctive building development is widely visible in the Spessart. The municipal territory of Haibach includes a lot of woodlands made up mostly of mixed forest. Constituent communities Haibach's Ortsteile are Haibach, Gr√ºnmorsbach and D√∂rrmorsbach. Climate The climate is moderate and warm (Bayerisch Nizza, or \\"Bavarian Nice\\"). Haibach represents a meteorological divide between the Main Plain and the High Spessart. History Haibach had its first documentary mention in 1187. At the time there was a noble seat called Ketzelburg on the edge of the community, whose ruins were archaeologically explored in 2004 and 2005. Haibach's original name was Haginaha, meaning \\"Border Brook\\". Over the course of 500 years the name became Hegebach, Heybach and Haydebach until 1790 when it settled on the current form. The brook Haibach is part of the R√∂derbach. In the course of municipal reform in 1978, the former community of D√∂rrmorsbach was amalgamated with Haibach. As early as 1972, Gr√ºnmorsbach had been swallowed up into the greater community. In the Bavaria State Development Plan (Landesentwicklungsplan Bayern), Haibach is set out as a small centre and is among the most progressive communities in the Vorspessart and Lower Main regions. Out of the original residential and farming village, Haibach developed after the Second World War into more of a preferred residential community in the Aschaffenburg region. With small and midsize industrial and craft businesses locating here, the community was strengthened in its economic performance and tax base. A school centre with primary school and Hauptschule was built in 1965 and three kindergartens sponsored by the Catholic church administration and the Saint John organizations were established. In 1974 the community built the volunteer fire brigade a new fire station. In 1977, the sport centre with a cultural and sport hall and a stadium were brought into service. A water cistern on the Buchberg and the a funerary hall in the Waldfriedhof (\\"Forest Graveyard\\") followed by 1983. In May 1983, the youth and clubhouse was brought into service. On 21 June 1987, an arson attack by the terrorist group Rote Zora on the Haibach location of the Adler chain of clothing shops failed. In 1988 and 1989, the sport hall Am Hohen Kreuz (\\"At the High Cross\\") was built. On 3 May 2001, the new community centre in the constituent community of D√∂rrmorsbach was dedicated. The community's landmark is three crosses on the Bessenbacher Weg playground. They recall the legend of the knight Heydebach and his lady love. The community's status of \\"market community\\" was never officially celebrated or announced. Demographics=Religion There are three Catholic churches in the community: * St. Nikolaus von der Fl√ºe, Haibach * St. Johannes der T√§ufer, Gr√ºnmorsbach * St. Johannes der T√§ufer, Gr√ºnmorsbach (old church under monumental protection) * St. Laurentius, D√∂rrmorsbach There is also one Protestant church: * Paul- Gerhardt-Kirche Economy In Haibach are found, among others, the head office of the Adler chain of clothing shops, the German headquarters of Macrovision Corporation and the European headquarters of Renzi AG.

Constituent communities Johannesberg's Ortsteile are Breunsberg, Johannesberg, Oberafferbach, R√ºckersbach and Steinbach. Furthermore, three hamlets are to be found in Johannesberg: Rauenthaler Hof, Sternberg and Hagelhof. History The first church on the Johannesberg was likely built between 1200 and 1300, in the Romanesque style. As a high church it was built outside the community of Oberafferbach. In 1351, Rauenthal had its first documentary mention. The Aschaffenburg Monastery was enfeoffed with the Geipelshof (estate) near Johannesberg in 1440. The old parish house had its first documentary mention in 1550. With Count Philipp von Rieneck's death in 1559, the noble family died out and the Bishops of Mainz took over power in the Spessart (range) for good. The Electorate of Mainz declared in 1682 that all children between the ages of 6 and 12 were obligated to attend school. In the course of the War of the Austrian Succession, British troops destroyed the church in Johannesberg in 1743. From early 1768 it was rebuilt and expanded. It was completed about 1774. In 1945, U.S. troops occupied Oberafferbach and Johannesberg, as well as Mainaschaff, Laufach and Goldbach. In the first, voluntary phase of municipal reform, the formerly self-administering communities of Breunsberg, Johannesberg, Oberafferbach and R√ºckersbach merged into a new entity with the name Johannesberg. In 1976, the communities of Johannesberg and Glattbach together formed the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (municipal association) of Rauenthal. In accordance with the Lower Franconian government's decision, the outlying centre of Rauenthal ‚Äì formerly an exclave ‚Äì was split from the community of Johannesberg and merged into the community of Glattbach instead. After the voluntary phase of municipal reform ended, the community of Steinbach was forcibly incorporated into Johannesberg in 1978. Between Johannesberg and Val Orne-Ajon in the French department of Calvados, an official partnership was established in 1990 with quite a number of centres, namely Avenay, Amay√©-sur-Orne, Maizet, Montigny, Pr√©aux-Bocage, Maisoncelles-sur-Ajon, Sainte-Honorine-du-Fay and Vacognes-Neuilly. On 18 May 1996, the French community of Trois-Monts joined the group as the ninth community. The Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Rauenthal was dissolved by law in 1994. The community of Johannesberg once again has its own municipal administration. In 2000, Johannesberg's 800-year jubilee celebration took place. Demographics Within the municipal area lived 2,730 inhabitants in 1970, 3,391 in 1987 and 3,833 in 2000.

Geography=Location Constituent communities The community of Kleinostheim is about 40 kilometers east southeast of Frankfurt am Main about a half hour drive from it. Kleinostheim lies upstream from Frankfurt on the Main river. It is at the western edge of the Spessart range near Aschaffenburg. Like the nearby city of Mainz to the west, the 50th parallel north goes through the community. Constituent communities Kleinostheim's four Ortsteile are Kleinostheim, Waldstadt, Industriegebiet West and Wingert. The later three, however, are not officially recognized. Community of Kleinostheim as a residential town Owing to the favourable transport connections over an important north-south railway link and the Autobahnen A 3 and A 45, and because it lies on the Rhine-Danube waterway and in the middle of the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region, the community offers many advantages as a location. Kleinostheim benefits from lying near prosperous cities such as Frankfurt, Offenbach and Aschaffenburg by serving as a commuter town. Since the 1960s, the community's population has more than doubled from 4,000 to over 8,000. History Kleinostheim was most likely founded in the 6th century as Ossenheim by the Franks, and in 975, it had its first documentary mention. For almost a thousand years it was ecclesiastically and politically tightly bound with Saints Peter's and Alexander's Monastery in Aschaffenburg. On 21 January 1945, the community suffered the most dreadful day in its history. In an air raid, more than 500 buildings were either damaged or utterly destroyed, and 61 people were killed. Commemorating this is a memorial site, renovated in 1995, at the graveyard. In 1951, the third Saint Lawrence's Church (Laurentiuskirche) in the Catholic parish's over 1000-year history was consecrated. Nearby, in 1955, so was Saint Mark's Church (Markuskirche) for the new Evangelical parish. In 1814, Kleinostheim passed to Bavaria, having belonged before that, since the 10th century, to the Electorate of Mainz.

Kleinostheim lies between the Main and the Spessart, which is well known for its oaks. This is symbolized by the oaktree in the arms. The wavy base refers to the community's geographical location between the Main and the Spessart. Kleinostheim is a very old community with an agricultural history going back more than twenty centuries. Standing for this is the spade blade, which was actually an archaeological find from Celtic times. The Wheel of Mainz and the tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) are taken from the arms borne by the Electorate of Mainz and recalls the community's former allegiance to this state.

Geography=Location The community lies in northwest Bavaria east of Aschaffenburg. Laufach lies in the heart of the Vorspessart (range) and stretches through its outlying centre of Hain into the High Spessart. The community's elevation ranges from 170 to 500 m above sea level. Subdivisions Laufach's Ortsteile are Frohnhofen (898 inhabitants), Hain (1,177 inhabitants) and Laufach (3,204 inhabitants). History In 1084, Laufach, which was originally known as Laufahe, had its first documentary mention in an obituary from Saints Peter and Alexander collegiate church in Aschaffenburg. Laufach's name came from the stream on which it was built. Over the years, the community's name has changed many times, from Laufache in 1182, to Loifahe in 1191, to Loupha in 1348, to Lauffach around 1528 and 1624 before settling on Laufach in the early 19th century. The Laufach valley was settled under the protection of the Counts of Rieneck, who already held the Vogtei (position of Vogt) from the Archbishopric of Mainz and the collegiate church in Aschaffenburg. On the Rieneck free court in 1380 ‚Äì where Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù) from Laufach were specifically mentioned ‚Äì settlers sat as free citizens. In the mid-14th century, glassmakers were brought into service in the Spessart with special incentives. Since they had to leave the forest from Martinmas (11 November) until Easter, they sought winter dwellings in Hain and Laufach. Many of these workers settled here owing to family ties. Already by 1469, there was a mine near the \\"Weyber\\" palace (Schloss Weyber, Weyberh√∂fe). In Unserer lieber Frauen Teil, presumably part of the Liebesgrund, copper was mined. After the Thirty Years' War, ores were mined and smelted. In the mid-18th century, in the area of today's sporting ground, a hammer mill was built. The building of a railway in the years 1850 to 1854 had a very positive effect on the community's industrial development. With the railway station, an important transport link with Aschaffenburg and the whole Lower Main was created. In the course of time, the ironworks became an integrated industry in which both the mining and the processing were done, yielding a finished product. Even trades and crafts were important to Laufach quite early on. From earlier craft businesses grew highly productive operations. In 1866, shortly after the Austro-Prussian War broke out, the engagements near Frohnhofen between Prussia and troops of the German Confederation took place during the Campaign of the Main (Mainfeldzug). In 1984, the community of Laufach celebrated 900 years of existence. Frohnhofen and the outlying centre of Hain developed into purely residential areas in which most inhabitants earned their income in the industrial and commercial businesses in Laufach, Aschaffenburg and the surrounding area. Laufach's economy underwent a shift from agriculture to industry. To further foster commercial-industrial growth, the Laufach-Ost commercial area was developed, covering an eight-hectare area between Laufach and Hain. Another such area was developed in 2001 on a four-hectare area between Laufach and Frohnhofen. Religion There are a Catholic church and an Evangelical church in the core municipality. Until 1184 the people of the Laufach valley had to go to the Aschaffenburg Mother of God parish for church services, then from 1184 to 1250 to Bessenbach, and then from 1250 to 1810 to Sailauf. On 28 November 1810, Laufach, together with Hain, was raised to a double parish. In 1812, a bigger church was built, which then stood on the Kirchberg until 1962. In 1964, on the same spot, a new church building was consecrated to Saint Thomas More. In 1995, Saint Peter's Evangelical Church (Petruskirche) celebrated its 90th birthday. Demographics Before the Thirty Years' War began in 1618, Laufach was a village with 76 Unterthanen (a word that usually means ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù in German, but in this case it means ‚Äúmen or families‚Äù) ‚Äì all together 300 inhabitants. After the disastrous war, according to a description of properties from 1651, there were 12 men and 33 ‚Äúhearth places‚Äù (houses). Through an energetic promotional effort by the Elector of Mainz, the depopulated Spessart was newly settled with soldiers, craftsmen and foreigners. The old family names had disappeared and new ones made their appearance. In 1668, Laufach had 72 households and 105 inhabitants. Until Napoleonic times, Laufach belonged to Electoral Mainz. From 1803 to 1810 it belonged to the Principality of Aschaffenburg, then passing until 1813 to the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. Since 1814, Laufach has been on Bavarian soil. At that time, Laufach and Frohnhofen counted all together 115 houses with 161 households and 1,451 inhabitants. The inflow of those driven from their homelands by the Second World War brought the population up to 2,552 in 1950. In 1967 there were more than 3,000 inhabitants in Laufach, among them 56 foreigners. With municipal reform in 1978 and the attendant amalgamation of the community of Hain im Spessart, the population rose to 4,545 all told, 2,995 from Laufach, 687 from Frohnhofen and 863 from Hain. In mid-2001, 5,267 persons were living in Laufach, among them 580 foreigners from 42 different nations.

It is the site of Mespelbrunn Castle, one of the most famous landmarks of the Spessart region, and of the Wallfahrtskirche Hessenthal, for more than 700 years the destination of a Christian pilgrimage. Geography=Location The community lies in the Spessart hill range, a Mittelgebirge. Most of the houses are located in the valley of the Elsava, but the municipal territory extends into the wooded hills, especially to the east. Subdivision The community was formed out of the former municipalities of Hessenthal and Mespelbrunn. Today, it has three Ortsteile (Hessenthal, Mespelbrunn and Schloss Mespelbrunn) on two Gemarkungen (cadastral areas), Hessenthal and Mespelbrunn. Neighbouring communities The neighbouring communities are (from the north, clockwise): Bessenbach, the unincorporated areas and , Heimbuchenthal, Leidersbach and the unincorpoared area . The latter two are located in the neighbouring district of Miltenberg. History The foundation of the villages Hessenthal and Neudorf (after 1939: Mespelbrunn) was the result of settlement activities in the Spessart by the Archbishops of Mainz and the Counts of Rieneck, respectively. Between the two villages ran the territorial border between these lords. The pilgrimage to Hessenthal (see church below) goes back at least to 1293. It was established by Mainz as a response to the Rienecks' foundation of Kloster Himmelthal. In the Middle Ages, the Elsava valley and Hessenthal were located on the juncture of two important long distance trade routes, the Via Publica through the Spessart to the Main crossing at Lengfurt (today a part of Triefenstein) and the early-medieval Salzweg from Worms. The west-east route from Aschaffenburg to W√ºrzburg gained in importance in the 18th century, resulting in the establishment by Mainz of a fortified road through the Spessart and an overland mail station at Hessenthal around 1800. It prospered until a new route from Lohr to Aschaffenburg via Hain (now part of Laufach) was established. In 1854, the Ludwig Western Railway was built, shifting transit traffic to the railway. The inn that served as mail station (Zur Post) was visited in 1826 by Wilhelm Hauff and is one of several possible inspirations for the inn in his novella Das Wirtshaus im Spessart, later to become a successful film (The Spessart Inn).

Rothenbuch is located between the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region, centred on Frankfurt, and the W√ºrzburg region. The nearest international airport is Frankfurt Airport and the nearest InterCityExpress stop is the railway station at Aschaffenburg. History In 1318, Rothenbuch had its first documentary mention in the words zuo den Rodenboychen when the Archbishop of Mainz, Peter of Aspelt and the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Gottfried III of Hohenlohe, concluded an agreement here dealing with cooperation on security questions. In 1342, building work began on what was initially likely a hunting lodge at the source of the Hafenlohr. In the German Peasants' War in 1525, this Schloss (castle) in Rothenbuch was heavily damaged or destroyed. In 1566, it was not only rebuilt but also expanded on Elector of Mainz Daniel Brendel von Homburg‚Äôs orders. A first drawing of Rothenbuch is to be found on the oldest extant map of the Spessart, the so-called Pfinzigkarte from 1594. Rothenbuch achieved its greatest political importance when the Amtskellerei Rothenbuch, a financial and administrative authority for 14 places in the High Spessart, was established. In 1782, Rothenbuch was declared the seat of the Amtsvogtei. The Electoral Mainz Amt passed along with this under the 1803 Reichsdeputationshauptschluss to the newly formed Principality of Aschaffenburg, with which it passed in 1814 (by this time it had become a department of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt) to the Kingdom of Bavaria. On 3 June 1814, Rothenbuch became the seat of a Royal Bavarian Court. In 1879, the Court was dissolved and Rothenbuch was incorporated into the Bezirksamt and later District (Landkreis) of Lohr. In 1972, this district was abolished and Rothenbuch was grouped into the current Aschaffenburg district. From 1977 to 1993, Rothenbuch formed a Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (municipal association) with Waldaschaff and Weibersbrunn. On 1 January 1994, Rothenbuch regained its municipal autonomy.

In producing businesses this was 118, and in trade and transport 25. In other areas, 48 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls were employed, and 665 such workers worked from home. There was one processing business. Five businesses were in construction (2 in the industry itself and 3 others in related fields), and furthermore, there are 2 agricultural operations with a meadowland area of 157 ha.

In 1189, the lordly estate of Sigilovf(e), meaning \\"glistening brook\\", and out of whose name arose the placename Sailauf, had its first documentary mention. In the 13th century, Sailauf was for a short time ruled by the Counts of Rieneck, who built the castle Landesere on the nearby . In 1265, the Archbishop of Mainz, built the hunting lodge castrum vivarium, which was later renamed Weyberhof. When the Plague raged in Europe in 1349, the Vorspessart was all but emptied of people. Newcomers later came to Sailauf from the Steigerwald. In 1552, Schloss Weyberhof was destroyed. In the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), Sailauf was almost completely destroyed. In 1789, Saint Vitus's Church (Sankt-Vitus-Kirche) was built above Sailauf, believed to be the fourth church built on this spot.

The blue wavy bend sinister stands for the community's location at the forks of the Sailauf and the Steinbach, two local brooks. The green oak twig with the acorn refers to the Spessart range, which is thickly wooded with oaks, and in which the community lies. The arms were conferred on 21 March 1969. Culture and arts Sailauf features the yearly Sailaufer Knoblauchfest (\\"Sailauf Garlic Festival\\") and the Tsukahara-Festival.

It has a population of around 1,100. Geography Sommerkahl is located in the Mittelgebirge Spessart, in the valley known as Kahlgrund, northeast of Aschaffenburg and not far from the border between the states of Bavaria and Hesse. Subdivisions Constituent communities The community‚Äôs Ortsteile are Sommerkahl and Vormwald. History Sommerkahl was first mentioned in 1184. The oldest part of the settlement is Untersommerkahl, around the B√∂hmerhof. Obersommerkahl and Vormwald followed in late medieval times. In 1542, the Archbishop of Mainz, Albrecht granted a permit to mine ore in Sommerkahl. Kupferschiefer was mined for copper. The first period of mining here ended during the Thirty Years' War. It was resumed in the second half of the 17th century. 42 out of a total 50 claims active at the time in the Spessart region were located in the upper Kahl valley, 11 of them in Sommerkahl. From the late 19th century, the Grube Wilhelmine was active with copper being mined in several tunnels. Today, access is limited to a depth of around 23 meters, but when active, mining took place at up to 40 meters. Further mining took place at 60 meters and at least one pit reached 80 meters. These tunnels are now flooded. Boosted temporarily by a dearth of commodities during World War I, mining here ceased in 1922.

The settlement was established by the Romans who built a fort here in the 1st century AD. Stockstadt has a population of around 8020.  Geography = Location  Stockstadt am Main lies on Aschaffenburg‚Äôs western town limit on the Main‚Äôs left bank. To Stockstadt‚Äôs west and northwest runs the boundary with Hesse, and southwest of Stockstadt lies the Bachgau.  Neighbouring communities  To the south is the community of Gro√üostheim, and to the southwest, beyond the state boundary, in Hesse, lies Babenhausen; northwest lie Mainhausen and Seligenstadt. The nearest neighbouring communities are Kleinostheim to the north and Mainaschaff to the east. Stockstadt am Main  History  The Romans built a castrum at Stockstadt, as part of the Limes Germanicus. In the 1st century AD a small earthen fortification was erected. Around the year 100 it was replaced by a full cohort fort further to the southeast. This castrum had a size of 3.2 ha. Over time, it was occupied by the cohorts III Aquitanorum, II Hispanorum and I Aquitanorum. Stockstadt was also the site of a \\":de:Benefiziarer station\\" (i.e. a road house). After the withdrawal of the Romans from the area, the regional population declined. Burgundians and Alemanni moved through the lower Main region, but it was only under the Franks (after 500 AD) that the population density again rose noticeably. Their settlements often did not simply grow out of the formerly Roman cores but included separate newly established sites. At Stockstadt, a Frankish graveyard was discovered to the northwest of the Roman structures. The Frankish settlement was likely located nearby, on the right bank of the Gersprenz, north of the former Roman structures. The initial parish church and graveyard were located not in this area but around 700 meters to the southeast, at the location of the former castrum. It is likely that a separate settlement was still in existence then at this site and it may even have been more important than the other site. The parish church was dedicated to the saints Marcellinus and Peter, the patrons of Seligenstadt Abbey, to which Stockstadt temporarily belonged. It is unclear, whether this settlement was later abandoned or moved to the northwest. Later during the Middle Ages, the settlement between Gersprenz and Main was fortified by a wall with towers and moat. The church initially remained at the southeasterly location, however. At the site of the current church, the Leonhardskirche, remains of an earlier structure only date from the Gothic period. Stockstadt am Main had its first documentary mention as early as the 9th century, if only through some townsmen who were obliged to pay taxes. These are listed as living in Stocestat, as the community was known then. Eventually the community itself was named in writing for the first time in 1024. Stoddenstat was donated to Fulda Abbey by Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. This lasted until 1309, when Stockstadt was given to the Archbishopric of Mainz. In the Middle Ages the surrounding forests belonged to the Dreieich Royal Hunting Forest (Wildbann Dreieich), which also had one of its 30 Wildhuben (farming estates whose owners were charged with guarding the king‚Äôs hunting rights) in Stockstadt.

Etymology The name \\"Weiberbrunn\\" is derived from the Weibersbach, a contributory of the Hafenlohr. It rises at the western end of the village. The Middle High German Brunn refers to a well or spring. Weibers probably derives from the proper name \\"Wibert\\".Wolf-Armin Frhr. v. Reitzenstein: Lexikon fr√§nkischer Ortsnamen. Herkunft und Bedeutung. C.H.Beck, M√ºnchen 2009, , p. 235. Geography=Location The community lies in the Spessart range of hills. It is located in the Aschaffenburg district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia (Unterfranken). Topographically, the town is located at an elevation of around 350 m in the valley of the Weibersbach, which is a side valley of the Hafenlohrtal. Subdivision Weiberbrunn has three Ortsteile: Weibersbrunn, Echterspfahl (2.5 km southwest of the town) and Rohrbrunn (4 km southeast of Weibersbrunn). The community has only the following Gemarkung (traditional rural cadastral area): Weibersbrunn. The municipal territory is not continuous: Both Echterspfahl and Rohrbrunn are separated from Weibersbrunn itself by stretches of forest that are part of the gemeindefreie Gebiete (see below). Neighbouring communities Weibersbrunn borders on (from the north, clockwise): , Rothenbuch, , . Except for Rothenbuch, these are all gemeindefreie Gebiete mostly covered by forest. History Originally, Weibersbrunn was just a roadhouse on the Eselsweg (donkey trail), a long- distance trade route through the Spessart. In 1706, the Weibersbrunner Glash√ºtte was founded as a subsidiary of the Electoral Mainz Spiegelglasmanufaktur (mirror manufacturing) at Lohr. For over 150 years, high-quality glass (window panes, goblets) was produced here. The highly valued semicircular crown glass sheets ‚Äì called Mondglas or \\"Moon Glass\\" ‚Äì used for window panes, was delivered to Aschaffenburg. Other products went to Lohr. Mondglas made Weibersbrunn internationally known. After Guillaume Brument, the French master glass maker died in 1759, local knowledge of the necessary techniques faded and the quality of the Mondglas declined. In addition, in the period of industrialization, local glass production became uncompetitive due to a lack of railway transport. Before the motorway was built, Weibersbrunn was connected to the outside world primarily by the Poststrasse (postal road) Aschaffenburg-W√ºrzburg, either at or at . The village grew around the glass works, with craftsmen supplying intermediate products and services to the works. Although glass production started to incur losses, these were covered by the Hochstift Mainz until its end in 1803. In 1805, the works were auctioned off and after that run by various entrepreneurs, but without much success. The Electoral Mainz area in the Hochspessart (High Spessart) was merged into the Principality of Aschaffenburg in 1803 and in 1810 it became part of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt, shortly thereafter, however, passing between 1814 and 1816 to the Kingdom of Bavaria by way of Austria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, the current community came into being with the Gemeindeedikt (\\"Municipal Edict\\") of 1818. In 1861, the glass works closed following a long period of stagnation. This brought on a period of destitution for the local population that only ended with the building of the motorway around 100 years later. During that time, locals had to earn a living as itinerant labourers in the large cities or in strenuous forestry work as the local soil was ill-suited for successful agriculture. Virtually no signs of glass production remain today, the works were replaced by the new parish church in 1862 (consecrated in 1864). Glass products made at Weibersbrunn can today be viewed in the Spessartmuseum at Lohr and in a small Heimatmuseum in the village. On 1 July 1862, the ' was established and its territory included Weibersbrunn. In 1939, Germany introduced Landkreise (districts) and Weibersbrunn now was one of 33 communities in the old Landkreis Aschaffenburg. In the course of Gebietsreform, this was merged with ' to form the current Landkreis Aschaffenburg (Aschaffenburg district). The Autobahn (motorway) through the Spessart was built in 1955-60. This allowed locals to commute to the Rhine- Main region and brought in tourists. Hotels were opened and the motorway restaurants and gas stations at Rohrbrunn brought tax income to the municipality. In 1966, the parish church St. Johannes Nepomuk was enlarged. From 1977 to 1993, Weibersbrunn was part of a Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (administrative community) with Waldaschaff and Rothenbuch. In 2006, the community marked its 300th anniversary with a great festival. Rohrbrunn This settlement, located at an elevation of around 465 m, is today made up of the service buildings on both sides of the motorway, a former Forstamt and the Jagdschloss Luitpoldh√∂he. In 1686, Melchior Urzuber, a hunter for the Archbishop of Mainz opened an inn here. It later became a posting house of the Kaiserliche Reichspost (Imperial Mail). The last member of the Urzuber family left in 1790, and their successor replaced the wooden structure with a stone building. In 1820, the Postdirektion Frankfurt of the Thurn-und-Taxis Post dissolved the station, but it remained an inn. From 1920, it was run by a new tenant under the name Wirtshaus im Spessart, probably inspired by Wilhelm Hauff's story (which also was the basis of a 1958 film. The inn was demolished during the construction of the Autobahn in 1959. It remains unclear, though, whether Hauff himself was modelling the inn in his story on the Rohrbrunn place or on a similar location in Hessenthal. Also at Rohrbrunn is the ' which was built in 1889 and served as Prince Regent Luitpold's hunting lodge. He visited Weibersbrunn when hunting boars and deer between 1887 and 1911. From 1920-96, the castle was used as living quarters for the forest service. Today, it is private property. Echterspfahl This is named after a wooden stake with three metal rings. Historically, the woodland possessions of the Counts of Rieneck, the Prince-Bishops of W√ºrzburg and the family (of Mespelbrunn Castle) met in this area. In case of border disputes, representatives of the feudal lords reportedly came here, each tying their respective horses to one of the metal rings. Today, there is an inn here (in operation since 1934), in a building that previously served as a forester's lodge. Demographics Within community limits in 1970, 1,817 inhabitants were counted, in 1987 1,934, in 2000 2,146 and in 2006 2,109. The figures given for Weibersbrunn's population in the 19th century are 721 in 1826, 960 in 1852 and 817 in 1859 (Klauprecht 1826, Virchow 1968, Hecht/Reder 2002). Economy Municipal tax revenue amounted in 1999 to ‚Ç¨975,000 (converted), of which net business taxes accounted for ‚Ç¨144,000. Weibersbrunn glass plant, founded in 1706 by Electoral Mainz mirror manufacturers, was the community's genesis. According to official statistics, there were 52 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in producing businesses in 1998. In trade and transport this was 41. In other areas, 304 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls were employed, and 818 such workers worked from home. Nobody was employed in processing businesses. Two businesses were in construction, and furthermore, in 1999, there were as many agricultural operations. Attractions Weibersbrunn is surrounded by \\"magnificent high forests\\".

This was the heraldic charge borne by the Archbishopric of Mainz, to which the community belonged until the Old Empire's downfall in 1803. It is also shown in Electoral Mainz's tinctures. On the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is a mirror symbolizing the glassworks established in the community in 1698 and in Rechtenbach and Lohr am Main. Archbishop Lothar Franz von Sch√∂nborn hired French glassmakers for this enterprise. Their plants made plate glass for mirrors. Glassmaking was ended between 1801 and 1803 in Rechtenbach and Lohr am Main, but only in 1864 in Weibersbrunn. The spring is a canting charge referring to the last syllable in the community's name ‚Äì ‚Äúspring‚Äù is Brunnen in German. The community has borne the arms since 14 June 1971. Infrastructure Weiberbrunn is located on the Bundesautobahn 3. There are two interchanges (Weibersbrunn and Rohrbrunn).

It meets the standards outlined in the definition of waterproof concrete. Developed in Australia in the mid-20th century, millions of cubic yards of hydrophobic concrete have been laid in Australia, Asia, and Europe, and in the United States since 1999. Its effective use in hundreds of structures has contributed to its large acceptance and growing use.http://www.hycrete.com/hydrophobic-concrete-in-so- cal/ http://www.hycrete.com/files/media-releases/Hycrete-Media-01-01-06.pdf  Structure  Typical concrete is quite hydrophilic. This comes from its intricate system of tiny capillaries, which suck water through the microcrack network within a concrete slab.https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/civilengineering/Public/UG4%20conf%202014/E7%20-%20Robert%20Barakat%20FYP.pdf This hardened matrix creates a continuous \\"source to sink\\" cycle, meaning water from above is constantly pulled to an area of lower elevation. Darcy's coefficient refers to the ability of liquefied water under pressure to flow through any pores and capillaries that are present. A lower Darcy's constant correlates with a higher quality material. Commercial companies use different approaches to modify a regular concrete mixture in order to create hydrophobic concrete, all of which involve somehow filling the porous concrete mixture. Some of the most commonly used methods include polymer formation, small speck infusion, and crystalline formations, the latter being the most widely used. Polymer formation works by having a water-soluble pre-polymer polymerize via ion exchange with di-valent metal ions such as Ca and Fe ions to form rubbery insoluble particles. These small particles migrate and concentrate in the small fissures and capillaries formed in the concrete as it dries. As polymerization proceeds, rubber plugs form and permanently seal these water pathways, greatly reducing both water absorption and water permeability. Crystalline technology is used to create hydrophobic concrete by causing crystal structures to form in the tiny capillaries, pores and other air pockets left behind in the concrete curing process. During this formation, by- products are left behind in the capillaries and pores of the freshly cured concrete, typically calcium hydroxide, sulfates, sodium carbonates, potassium, calcium, and hydrated and unhydrated cement particles. These crystal structures then plug the pores and capillaries, preventing water from flowing through them. Once the crystalline chemicals are added to the concrete mixture, through either an admixture or coating, they react with the by- products in the presence of water. This reaction then forms an insoluble crystal structure that clogs the pores. This process continues until all the chemicals have reacted. When applied as a coating, the chemical reaction proceeds through the process of chemical diffusion. This is a process of a high chemical density solution migrating towards the low density chemical solution until the two come into equilibrium. Soaking the concrete in water creates a low chemical density in the pores, and applying the crystalline chemical as a coating then creates a high chemical density. These two fluids diffuse through the inner structure of the concrete until they reach equilibrium throughout the inner structure. When this process is finished, the hydrophobic concrete's crystal structure is complete.  Properties  The ultimate goal when forming a hydrophobic material is to reduce the polarity of the molecules. Because water molecules are very polar, they are easily attract to partially positive or partially negative charges. On a neutral surface, water molecules bunch up and attract each other, creating a spherical droplet of water. These droplets can then evaporate off the concrete surface rather than be absorbed into the capillaries of the concrete. The exact structure and composition of the crystals used in hydrophobic concrete is not public information; due to its properties, however, it can be assumed that it is a non-polar molecule. The property to repel water gives hydrophobic concrete the ability to avoid contamination by particles dissolved in water drops. Because the crystals themselves are not polar, there is little interaction between the crystals and dissolved oxygen. This allows the concrete to withstand the rebar rusting that so often compromises the strength of concrete that has iron bars running through it. Standard commercial concrete has an average water absorption of 4-10%. In contrast, hydrophobic concrete has an average of 0.3-1%. An overlooked property of hydrophobic concrete is its ability to repel humidity in the air as well. In contrast to liquid water, water molecules in the air moving with a higher kinetic energy and ultimately exist in a gas-like form. The crystal structures in hydrophobic concrete are compact enough to prevent humidity from moving through the capillaries of the concrete.  Processing  Hydrophobic concrete is produced in a variety of ways that fall under two categories; coatings or admixtures. Both allow the crystal structures to form in the presence of water. When creating hydrophobic concrete through a coating process, a coating is sprayed or brushed onto a porous surfaces. In most cases, it is applied to a regular concrete slab that then undergoes a corrosive process to expose more of the concrete's capillaries. This can be achieved by water blasting the surface at about 3,000-4,000 psi. Sandblasting and acid etching are also suitable processes. The addition of water is the next step. It can be applied either vertically or horizontally, but temperatures should not go below 33 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent freezing. Excessive evaporation should also be avoided. In areas with high evaporation rates, this process often takes place overnight when temperatures are cooler. Once the pores are saturated as much as possible with water, the coating is applied. Hydrophobic chemicals are in a powder form and mixed with water at a ratio of five parts powder to two parts water for application by brush. For spray application, the ratio is five parts powder to three parts water. The coating is applied between 1.25-1.5 lb per square yard and continues until the whole surface is covered. If the surface requires another coat, it must be applied within forty eight hours of the initial application of the hydrophobic mixture. Once applied, the concrete must cure in a moist environment two to three hours after the application. This is achieved by spraying the surface with water at least three times a day for a few days. Evaporation retardants are also ccasionally used. Depending on the climate, the curing process may take longer and require more frequent wetting. Once the concrete is cured, it sits for two to three weeks before the process is complete. When hydrophobic concrete is made through the use of an admixture, a powder with the hydrophobic chemicals is added during the batching process. In other words, it is added to the concrete mixture itself when the concrete is laid.The usual dosage is two to three percent of the concrete mixture. Because water is a part of the batching process, an additional curing process is not required. This approach is easier and less labor-intensive, but it can only be used when new concrete is laid.  Uses  Hydrophobic concrete can be used in the same applications as regular concrete, most often where regular concrete is dangerous to repair or the cost of structural damage would be highly detrimental. Tunnel work is a major application of hydrophobic concrete as underground repairs are difficult and costly.http://www.hycrete.com/broadview-technologies-acquires-hycrete-inc/ It is also a favorite choice for laying foundations for buildings and sidewalks in locations below the water table. Underwater use of hydrophobic concrete is a major application in marine facilities. Is often used to hold water to create pools and ponds. NASA used hydrophobic concrete to build the swimming pool used to train astronauts for walking on the moon. Hydrophobic concrete is also used in applications that are exposed to rain or rain puddling, such as green roofs, other kinds of roofs, parking structures, and plazas.  Advantages Amongst the many benefits of using hydrophobic concrete, it reduces installation time and lowers costs. Use of hydrophobic concrete can reduce the labor time of industrial project because normal concrete involves a corrosion proofing period as well as a waterproofing period. With hydrophobic concrete, both corrosion proofing and waterproofing are done at the same time. Likewise, time reduction reduces installation costs. Regular, membrane-backed concrete can cost around US$5 per square foot, although prices can vary based on the application. The one-step installation process of hydrophobic concrete brings the cost down to about US$3.20 per square foot. Such savings can quickly add up over the course of a project, as reported by the Hycrete company of southern California. An estimated five billion dollars were spent in Western Europe alone on hydrophilic cement repairs in 1998. Most of the repairs were necessary due to the damage of water corrosion in urban areas. Because there is little or no water corrosion, hydrophobic concrete is better preserved than regular concrete, which typically looks worn and aged after a few years. From an environmental standpoint, hydrophobic concrete is also beneficial because it is \\"green\\". Its ability to be re-crushed makes it easily reusable. Although regular concrete can be re-crushed, it involves a very costly process, which often means that the concrete ends up in a landfill. This advantage of hydrophobic concrete enables its cost-efficient reuse in future projects.  Disadvantages Some other cons to hydrophobic concrete come from the application process. When applied as a coating, it can only penetrate up to 12 inches into the material. Also, the coating process itself is extremely labor-intensive. If the structure is thicker than 12 inches, or it is a large-area project, an admixture approach would have better results. Using the alternative crystalline technology to produce hydrophobic concrete is only possible when water is present, since the surface must be carefully wetted before the coating is applied.(http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=49&C;=850&P;=2) References Category:Concrete ","title":"Hydrophobic concrete"},{"id":"10051463","text":"Hammerwich is a small village and civil parish in Lichfield District, Staffordshire, England, south-east of Burntwood.

Operation Cascade was one of the first successful Allied deception operations in World War II, and provided valuable experience for later operations. In 1942, the British forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East were very weak. To deter the Axis from attacking, a deception operation was planned. This operation was started by 'A' force under command of Colonel Dudley ClarkeHoward, pg 33 in 1941, and in 1942 eventually evolved into Operation Cascade.Howard, pg 43 The goal of the operation was to create a false order of battle in order to keep the Axis guessing as to the strength of the Allies in the region, by use of bogus troop formations, radio traffic and double agents. Implementation In 1941, 'A' force (the British organization responsible for army intelligence operations in the Middle East) had already created three bogus formations to deceive the enemy in the Mediterranean Theatre: the 1st SAS Brigade,Howard, pg 34 the 10th Armoured Division in the Western Desert, and the 7th Division to guard Cyprus. This fictional build-up was expanded into a systematic plan to inflate British strength throughout the Middle East. In March 1942, the real strength stood at 5 Armoured and 10 Infantry divisions. Cascade intended to increase this strength, for the benefit of enemy intelligence, to 8 Armoured and 21 infantry divisions.Crowdy, pg 168 Bogus units had to be created, and actually shipped from their bases in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa. An order of battle had to be drawn up for these units, crests and signs had to be created, and some form of physical presence was needed to convince enemy agents that the units existed. False radio traffic for enemy signals intelligence, and information gathered by civilian informers in Egypt, increased the Axis impression that these units were real and present in the theatre. Most of the civilian agents, however, were double agents controlled by 'A' force through a network called Cheese.Latimer, Pg. 155 Enemy documents, captured during and after the battle of El Alamein, showed that Cascade was a success. An analysis by 'A' force, published on 19 November 1942, showed that enemy intelligence overestimated the armoured strength of the British forces by 40%, and infantry strength by 45%.Howard, pg. 44 Influence Operation Cascade gave the Allies valuable experience in planning deception operations, which was later used to good effect in the deception operations covering the invasion of Europe (D-Day landings in Normandy, and the invasion of Southern France). The British forces built up during Operation Cascade were later used in Operation Zeppelin to tie down Axis forces in the Balkans and Greece, and deter the Axis from using these forces against the Allied invasion of Sicily, (Operation Husky).Crowdy, pg 281 In 1944, the actual Allied strength in the Mediterranean totalled about 52 divisions; Axis intelligence accepted a strength of about 70 divisions in the theatre.Howard, pg 137  See also  * Operation Bertram NotesFurther reading * Jon Latimer, Deception in War, London: John Murray, 2001 * Howard, Michael Eliot.

The ward population as taken at the 2011 Census was 2,114. Geography, name Stansty consists of Higher Stansty and Lower Stansty; Higher Stansty lies near to Summerhill and Moss Valley within the community of Gwersyllt and is north of the A483 road. Lower Stansty, or Plas Coch as it is now more commonly referred to, is partly within the neighbouring community of Rhosddu, south of the A483. The division between Higher and Lower Stansty is an ancient one, as Stansty Issa (i.e. Lower Stansty), also called Stansty Abbatis, was originally a part of the manor of Wrexham Abbott belonging to Valle Crucis Abbey.Williams, D. H. The Welsh Cistercians, Gracewing, 2001, p.209, Along with those of some other places in this area of north-east Wales, the name of Stansty may have an Old English rather than Welsh root, perhaps from stan (\\"stone\\") with another element, possibly -stig or -stigu (\\"path, or \\"sty\\").Charles, B. G. Non-Celtic Place- names in Wales, London: University College, 1938, p.206 History Stansty was one of the original townships of the Lordship of Bromfield and Yale, and was also a township of the ecclesiastical parish of Wrexham. It comprised two townships, Stansty Ucha (Upper Stansty) and Stansty Issa (Lower Stansty) which were merged into one at the time of the Commonwealth. Stansty Issa was given to the Abbot of Valle Crucis Abbey by Gruffydd ap Madoc, Prince of Powys, in 1254. Part of the township was transferred to the new parish of Gwersyllt in 1851, and other parts were transferred to the parishes of Southsea and Bersham in 1921 and 1934 respectively.Wrexham, GENUKI The civil parish of Stansty was split in 1935 between Gwersyllt and Wrexham Regis.Wrexham Registration District, GENUKI Stansty Park Much of the area was farmland until the 20th century and belonged to an estate called Stansty Park, originally a manor in Stansty Uchaf (Higher Stansty) purchased by David ap Meilir in 1317. One of his descendants, John ap David ap Edward (1573-1635) took the surname of Edwards; the family seat, Plas Issa, was built in 1577.Edwards of Stansty, Welsh Biography Online His children included John Edwards (b.1612), court physician to Charles I, and Jonathan Edwards (b.1615), Archdeacon of Derry, while his daughter Margaret married John Jones Maesygarnedd the regicide. John Edwards (1619‚Äì73) expanded the Stansty estate, later known as Stansty Park, until it took up most of Stansty township: however his great-great-grandson, Peter Edwards, died without issue in 1783, and the estate, passing to distant relatives, was eventually sold to the ironmaster Richard Thompson. Thompson built a new house, Stansty Hall, on the site in the 1830s. The late-Georgian hall at Stansty was later threatened by subsidence from coal mining and was largely demolished in the 1920s - a small section being incorporated into a more modern building - while some of the former estate's farmland has since been developed for modern housing. However, the park's highly elaborate wrought-iron gates, attributed to the Davies brothers of Wrexham, had been rescued and moved to Erddig Hall in 1908.Whittle, E. The historic gardens of Wales, Cadw, 1992, p.35 Though much the estate of Stansty Park has now gone, its name is still used for a modern housing estate near Summerhill and for the ground of Cymru Alliance league football team Lex XI F.C.. The name is also applied to the original 1577 house, Plas Issa, which still stands.Stansty Park, Gwersyllt, Cadw Plas Coch Another of the area's main houses was Plas Coch in Lower Stansty, which was built in the late 16th century in mature hand-made red brick, giving the house its name (Plas Coch translates roughly as \\"Red Hall\\"). It was a two storey building: the plan of the dwelling was a typical through passage house with access at either end of the passage. The house was built for Sir William Meredith, one of the sons of Richard Meredith of Allington or Trevalyn (near Rossett) and treasurer and paymaster of the army in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Edward Meredith, a brother to William, was recorded in 1610 as trading as draper in Cheapside, London and he had held the lease on Plas Coch from his nephew for a time. Edward Meredith held the office of the High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1629. In 1709 the Plas Coch estate was sold by Sir William Meredith of Kent to Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet of Gwydir Castle, Llanrwst. Plas Coch played an important part in the social life of the town, hosting the Denbighshire & Flintshire Agricultural Society Show and the Annual Wrexham Lager Festival. Sadly the house and outbuildings were demolished in the late 1980s to make way for a large supermarket and retail development. The only part of the original property remaining today is a short length of stone wall at the roadside in front of a branch of Homebase. During the construction of the retail development in 1991, a hoard of Roman coins was discovered by workmen: however all of the coins subsequently disappeared.Jones, D. History under foot, BBC Wales In 1995 further construction work on the site revealed traces of Roman field boundaries, hearths and a corn drying kiln. Coal mining era The area, like much of Wrexham, has a tradition of coal mining. Rhosddu Colliery, or the Wrexham & Acton Colliery as it was also known, was once reached along Colliery Road (the building of the A483 road has since divided the old colliery site). Colliery Road is still in existence today, but is now surrounded by a residential area.

After the war he continued to work as a broadcast reporter, and wrote a well-appreciated book about the liberation of Europe. He was killed in the crash of a BOAC Comet over the Mediterranean Sea. Early life Wilmot was born in Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne; he was the son of Reginald Wilmot, a sports journalist, and grandson of surveyor JGW Wilmot. He attended Melbourne Grammar School and then studied history, politics and law under Sir Ernest Scott at the University of Melbourne, where he resided at Trinity College and became interested in debating; after he graduated in 1936, he went on an international debating tour. One of the stops was in Nazi Germany where he went to a Nuremberg Rally. Wilmot began to work as a legal clerk in 1939. War reporter After working as a law clerk for only a few months, the outbreak of the Second World War led Wilmot to join the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He was sent to the Middle East in 1940 and reported from North Africa, Greece and Syria; he was in Tobruk during the siege of 1941. When Japan entered the war, Wilmot returned to Australia, then went out to cover the war in the Pacific. He reported from Papua during the Japanese invasion in 1942, including the Kokoda Track campaign, where he walked up to the forward area, around Abuari and Isurava, with fellow war correspondent Osmar White and cinematographer Damien Parer. Wilmot regarded General Sir Thomas Blamey as incompetent and protested at his sacking of Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell. Blamey cancelled Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good. BBC work There Wilmot wrote a book about his experiences in Tobruk, and narrated a documentary film called Sons of the ANZACs. In 1944 Wilmot transferred to the BBC where he was one of the principal reporters for D-Day, flying in a glider with the 6th Airborne Division. He was present at and reported from the field for most of the actions during the liberation of Europe. When the German high command surrendered, Wilmot was present to report on it. Military historian After the end of the war Wilmot remained in England, where he wrote articles on the recent war as well as a book about World War II, The Struggle for Europe. When it appeared in 1952, the book was favourably reviewed, and it is well regarded by military historians (John Keegan wrote, \\"Wilmot effectively invented the modern method of writing contemporary military history\\"). One of his articles criticizing the Allied plan to occupy Germany appeared in Life magazine.Wilmot, Chester, Allies Handed Stalin His Victory, Life Magazine, 10 March 1952 Wilmot intended to write a volume on the Siege of Tobruk and Battle of El Alamein for the Australian official history of the war, but was killed in the Comet crash; see Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945. Broadcaster Wilmot (right, back row), with war historians in Australia Wilmot was part of the television commentary team for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. For Christmas 1953, Wilmot was sent by the BBC to Australia to participate in a round-the-world broadcast on Christmas Day, where he narrated The Queen's Journey, telling the story of recent royal visits. The Queen herself was in New Zealand for Christmas. Death Wilmot was en route back to Britain from that assignment on BOAC Flight 781 when his plane, a Comet 1, broke up following explosive decompression over the Mediterranean Sea; all aboard were killed.

Geography Nordendorf, located on the federal highway 2 and the railway line Augsburg - Donauw√∂rth, and Blankenburg, which is stretching southwest up the Schmutterleite, form the current community since 1975. Northwest of Nordendorf is the monastery Holzen. History The name Nordendorf is of Franconian origin; evidence of an Alamanni forerunner settlement from around the middle of the 6th century came in 1844 when a row of 433 graves was uncovered on the occasion of the construction of the Augsburg-Donauw√∂rth railway line, making the site one of the most important sites of the early Middle Ages in the Swabian-Bavarian region. The most important archaeological finds are the hanger brooches of Nordendorf, two clasps with runic inscriptions engraved on the back. The current name is mentioned for the first time in 1213. Initially the lords of Donnsberg, Truchsesse of the Augsburg bishops, who had their castle on Donnsberg west of Nordendorf, were the lords of the manor. Around 1268 the Wittelsbachers destroyed Donnsberg Castle and Nordendorf came into their possession. In 1560 a new castle was built in the middle of the village, which burnt down in 1862. In 1580 a branch of the Fugger family had acquired the Nordendorf estate. This line lived here until 1878. After the Second World War Nordendorf developed from an agricultural village to an attractive residential community with an interesting surrounding area between Schmutter and Lech and the local recreation area \\"Augsburg Western Forests\\". The continuous increase in the number of inhabitants is ensured by the designation of building land at affordable prices. Today, agriculture is concentrated in the district of Blankenburg. Nordendorf offers an excellent infrastructure as a small centre. The needs of daily life such as shopping facilities, provision of (dental) medical services, partial secondary school and kindergarten, with banks and handicraft businesses are optimally solved. The train connections every 30 minutes to Augsburg, Meitingen or Donauw√∂rth make it easy to attend secondary schools and reach workplaces. The four-lane extension of the B2 between Augsburg and Donauw√∂rth and the local ring road created excellent opportunities for the settlement of companies. The local clubs offer a wide range of sporting and cultural activities.

In 1968, Dunn and his wife Luceen began fieldwork on the Tsimshian language in Kitkatla, British Columbia and Prince Rupert, B.C., under the supervision of the linguist Bruce J. Rigsby. He did follow-up fieldwork in Prince Rupert in 1971, in Metlakatla, Alaska, in 1972, and in Hartley Bay, B.C., in 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1978. This work involved designing the first modern, practical orthography for the language. He published his dictionary and grammar of the Tsimshian language (now known as Sm'algyax) in 1978 and 1979 respectively. They were reissued in a single volume in 1995 by the Sealaska Heritage Foundation. In the early 1990s he participated with Susan Marsden, Marie-Lucie Tarpent, Vonnie Hutchingson, and several Tsimshian language instructors in devising an updated Sm'algyax orthography in conjunction with producing the Teachings of Our Grandfathers book series for School District no. 52 of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. He was a retired professor of linguistics at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma.

He served as captain of Groningen in the First Anglo-Dutch War, being promoted to full captain in 1653, becoming flag captain of Vice-Admiral Witte de With on Vrijheid, fighting in the Battle of the Gabbard and the Battle of Scheveningen. In 1654 he had convoy duty in the Mediterranean. In 1656, in the Dutch-Portuguese War, he took two merchantmen during the blockade of Portugal. In 1658 he was flag captain of Vice-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter on Hilversum while again blockading Portugal. In 1661 he served in De Ruyter's fleet in the Mediterranean. When the Second Anglo-Dutch War threatened he was on 29 January appointed temporary Rear- Admiral with the Admiralty of Amsterdam. In the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665 he was second in command in the squadron of Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, taking over command of this unit when the latter was killed because his flagship exploded. The battle was a heavy defeat for the Dutch and those captains fighting bitterly to cover the retreat of the fleet were seen as heroes, among them Van der Hulst who was promoted on 25 July to Vice- Admiral. In the Four Days' Battle he was second in command in the squadron of Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp. On the second day due to a communication mistake Tromp failed to follow the turn of the main body of the Dutch fleet into the back of the English fleet. As a result, his squadron became isolated and attacked by a superior English force. Before De Ruyter could break the English line and save Tromp's force, several ships had taken a horrible pounding, among them Spiegel, Van der Hulst's flagship. He himself was mortally wounded by a musket ball in the breast. Spiegel was abandoned but later salvaged.

He later became a prominent financier and businessman in the San Francisco bay area. Early life Born in Vermont, Hayward moved to Canton, New York early in his life. He studied law in New York, but also pursued lumber and lead mining interests. California His experience in Michigan vein mining proved invaluable after his move to California in the Gold Rush of 1850. After buying an interest in the Eureka Mine in Amador County, Hayward made new investments and successfully extracted gold where others had failed, later selling shares in a mine which was said to have yielded more than $5,000,000. The US Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System states the city of Hayward was named after him. This is disputed by historians.Gudde, Erwin G., \\"California Place Names\\" (4th Ed. 1998) Family life Whether true or not, Hayward was often called California‚Äôs \\"first millionaire,\\" and in his lifetime was frequently referred to as ‚Äúthe richest man in California.‚Äù Grandiose and eccentric by turns, Hayward turned even more strongly to Spiritualism in his later years, using mediums to predict business investments (with poor results). Hayward had a difficult relationship with his wife, Charity (1826-1905), whom he married in Wisconsin in the 1840s; their first son, James, was born in 1846, and would die of consumption at age 27. Divorced in 1878, the couple remarried again later that year only to separate again, living the rest of their lives apart. Only two of the couple's eight children survived to adulthood; six others died of mysterious respiratory ailments early in life, prompting recent speculation that Charity Hayward may have had a role in their demise.San Mateo Daily Journal Could the poor woman have been a murderer? at www.smdailyjournal.com Hayward Park, his estate in San Mateo, included a lake, race track, and deer park. The spectacular 1880 residence was converted into a hotel after Hayward‚Äôs death. It burned in a 1920 fire.

The player follows the story of the titular Opoona as he attempts to find the location of his family from which he was separated after the occurrence of a mysterious accident during their travels. Former Dragon Quest art designer Shintaro Majima was the lead artist, with Sachiko Sugimura, who has also worked on Dragon Quest, as the planning director. Hitoshi Sakimoto, best known for composing Final Fantasy XII, produced the soundtrack, which was composed by him and his Basiscape musicians. Gameplay Throughout the game, Opoona will acquire a variety of licences for different jobs. Whilst some are mandatory for story progression, most are optional and add to the customization of the players game. The game can be played one-handed using just the Wii's Nunchuk attachment, but the Classic Controller can also be used. In battles, flicking the Nunchuk's analog stick will fire a projectile, the trajectory of which can be changed and adjusted according to the situation. The style of play is referred to in-game as the Active Bon-Bon Battle System and all actions occur in real time. Setting Before the events of Opoona, the planet Landroll was impacted by a large meteorite composed of crystallized dark energy. Half of the star, once lush and verdant, died from the impact, becoming the Deadlands. Life for the survivors changed drastically; the impact caused a shift in gravity, causing the sun to become tidally locked to the planet. Species died and vegetation withered in the heat; mysterious creatures, known as Rogues, emerged from the meteorite and began to attack people. Humans eventually built sturdy glass domes over Landroll's surviving cities. Sanctuary, an island floating above the northern pole, was unaffected and habitable areas outside the domes became the wild lands. Plot Several hundred years after the meteorite impact, Opoona and his siblings, Copoona and Poleena, are on a family vacation from the star Tizia with their parents, Momeena, Dadeena and co-pilots Troc and Noix, travelling in a spaceship to Landroll. Momeena tells Opoona that her brother, Roidman, lives on the planet doing research on how to reduce the Rogue population. Shortly after, the spaceship is attacked by mysterious dark energy, and the three children are placed into separate escape pods before the spaceship crashes on Landroll. Opoona awakens from a coma in Tokione Dome and is informed of the incident, and told that his parents are being treated by Sages in Sanctuary. He is then introduced to Aizal, the Head Sage, who tells Opoona it will take some time for them to recover due to a shortage of Matia. Opoona is enrolled at Starhouse school and is trained as a Landroll Ranger with help from Chaika, a young Ranger girl, and Commander Goldy, a high- ranking Landroll Ranger; at Starhouse, Opoona is reunited with his brother, Copoona, who has no idea where his sister's escape pod could be. Days after the spaceship incident, Poleena's escape pod is discovered in the wildlands. An elderly woman, Creola, recommends to Goldy that it would be best to care for Poleena herself, and to not inform Aizel. Once enrolled in Starhouse, Opoona is asked to investigate matters at the Wind Ravine as part of his training. Opoona finds that the source of the activity in the Ravine is his own escape pod, which still emanates some dark energy from the spaceship. Opoona graduates from Starhouse as a Level One Ranger, receiving assignments in Lifeborn, Artiela and the Intelligent Sea, where he is temporarily employed by both the Bravo and Shine companies to remove bugs from programming and to also help patients in the hospital ward. One of the patients identifies himself as Chaika's father, and Opoona later encounters Chaika herself. Chaika, an experienced engineer, checks Opoona's database file from the spaceship. She reveals that the attack was sent by Shagla, Aizel's younger twin brother who mysteriously disappeared years before. Chaika believes something is amiss, since a fleet large enough to be capable of destroying a spaceship has not been commissioned for several years. Opoona is now allowed retirement at a residential dome called Paradiso, and attends an official ceremony at Sanctuary. The party arrive at Sanctuary and meet Aizal in the Cathedral, who unleashes an extremely powerful spell at the both of them, stripping them of both their powers and memories. Poleena remains unconscious until sometime after the Sanctuary incident; Creola asks Poleena to bring her two older siblings to her. She is given a record of all of Opoona's assignment accomplishments and travels through the Holy Lands, which is now infested with Rogues. Upon arriving at Paradiso, Poleena encounters Copoona, who is reluctant to leave, believing there is nothing more for them to do; Poleena then takes Opoona and Copoona back to Creola's hut, where they recover their powers and memories. Creola asks the both of them to recover her son Shagla from the Earth Prison, who has been falsely imprisoned for years. Creola also proves that the attack on the spaceship was not ordered by Shagla, but rather by Aizel's commandant Babushca. After rescuing Shagla from the prison, Creola reveals a passageway in her hut to an underground base for the Partizians. They are reunited with Roidman and he explains that the only way to save Landroll is to defeat Babuscha, and that Opoona must recruit Partizans to aid him. The Partizans are recruited and together, Opoona and the others defeat Aizal and Babuscha. Characters *Opoona - The protagonist from the planet Tizia. He has an orange Energy Bon-Bon above his head that he can use as a projectile. He starts off in Tokione dome, where he is enlisted to join the Landroll rangers. Outside of the game, Opoona appeared as one of the playable characters in the 2017 crossover game Warriors All-Stars. *Poleena - Opoona's younger sister. She has two yellow Energy Bon-Bons above her head that resemble pigtails. Her escape pod crashes on the Orcalphin coast, where she is rescued by Aizel's mother *Copoona - Opoona's younger brother. His Energy Bon- Bon takes the place of his legs and is purple. He becomes a sage, who is accompanied in the beginning by Sage Sarit, one of Landroll's most respected elders. Development Opoona was developed by ArtePiazza, a Japanese game company responsible for creating and porting games in the Dragon Quest series for Enix. Artepiazza was asked by publisher Koei \\"to create fun and unique visuals that convey the enjoyment of an RPG in a simple fashion\\" in place of using state-of-the-art CG and hardware technology available at the time of the game's production. Rather than utilize the traditional \\"single hero\\" or \\"chosen one\\" motif of RPGS, the staff members at Artepiazza emphasized the importance of relationships and family in Opoona. Planning director Sachiko Sugimura desired to \\"express that every single person means something and that the world grows and changes in accordance with the loving relationships among all people, instead of depicting the main character only as a special existence.\\" Artepiazza wanted Opoona to appeal to family members of all ages instead of just children. The team designed the game so that it may be played with the Wii Remote Nunchuk attachment alone because of its limited control input that allows the player to casually play the game one-handed while relaxing or eating. The developers initially wanted to exclude any other control options, but decided to allow users to use the Remote or Classic Controller if they prefer. Art director Shintaro Majima stated that he was first inspired to create Opoona after waking from a nap, taking a bath, and drawing his first design on the bathroom mirror. The main characters were meant to be simple enough that they could be easily redrawn by children; enemies were designed as non-living objects to make them distinct. Majima's personal interest in modern architecture and industrial design were the driving force behind the visual style of Opoona and that the Wii's \\"clean\\" and \\"something new\\" style overlapped the game's image. Majima's brother Tatuso, a modern artist, planned the locations and landscapes using what he considered to be the most attractive blend of reality and imagination. The musical score for Opoona was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto and five fellow members of his Basiscape sound company. Sakimoto arranged the score in an orthodox manner with \\"futuristic\\" sounds as he had done with many of his past compositions by combining orchestral music with a synthesizer. However, his work on Opoona involved composing the songs through the characters' perspective to somehow lend the player their sympathy. The official soundtrack to Opoona was announced via Basiscape's Twitter account and was published over three years after the game's original Japanese launch. ArtePiazza began working on Opoona in the spring and summer of 2005. The project had no publisher until Dragon Quest designer Yuji Horii sparked talks between ArtePiazza and Koei following the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2006. Majima came up with the game's title and the main protagonist's name. By using an Energy Bon-Bon projectile as the letter \\"o\\" the title, the spelled out \\"Opoona\\" was meant to resemble a child firing an Energy Bon-Bon rapidly. The three \\"o's\\" in the title was also meant to match Opoona's round shape. Opoona was announced as an untitled RPG in a September 2006 issue of Japanese magazine Famitsu and was unveiled with its finalized title at a Koei press event the following March. Opoona was released in Japan on November 1, 2007 and in North America on March 25, 2008. The game was for release in Europe on July 25, 2008, but was delayed until September of that year. Reception Opoona suffered low sales upon its release in Japan. The game was released on the same day as Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy, a title that Artepiazza and Koei did not foresee as competition being in a different genre. Opoona received a positive review from Japanese magazine Famitsu, which gave it a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40. The publication credited the characterisation, length, music, and difficulty level. Elsewhere, Opoona received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Eurogamer praised the control system, pace and presentation, and said \\"it's charming, strange and often fun, but too shallow and stretched out\\".

Life and career He studied at the ArtEZ School of Music in Arnhem, where he currently is head of the Jazz & Pop dept. In 1986 he founded 2 bands: Bik Bent Braam (with Angelo Verploegen, Eric Boeren, Wolter Wierbos, Peter Haex, Carl Ludwig H√ºbsch, Peter van Bergen, Jan Willem van der Ham, Bart van der Putten, Frans Vermeerssen, Frank Gratkowski, J√∂rg Brinkmann, Michael Vatcher) and Bentje Braam. In 1987 Michiel Braam was commissioned by the NOS. He composed a work for 4 clarinets and piano entitled Cows and Beasts. It was performed by Braam on piano, and the clarinet players Ab Baars, Theo J√∂rgensmann, Michael Moore and Louis Sclavis. In 1989 he founded Trio BraamDeJoodeVatcher (with Wilbert de Joode and Michael Vatcher), in 2005 eBraam (fka Wurli Trio, with Pieter Douma and Dirk-Peter K√∂lsch), and in 2011 Michiel Braam's Hybrid 10tet (with eBraam, the classical Matangi String Quartet, Taylor Ho Bynum, Carl Ludwig H√ºbsch and Nils Wogram). In 2015 the trio \\"Nos Otrobanda\\" was formed with Aty de Windt on bass and Andr√© Groen on g√ºira. That band specialises in Antillean Walttzes. Together with Frans Vermeerssen he co-leads the sextet All Ears (with Herb Robertson, Frank Gratkowski, Wilbert de Joode and Michael Vatcher). He worked also with musicians like George Lewis, Benjamin Herman, Han Bennink, Conny and Hannes Bauer and Steve Arg√ºelles. The orchestra Bik Bent Braam was considered to be one of the main bigger orchestras in the field of improvisation-music and performed worldwide, as the trio BraamDeJoodeVatcher still does. In 2007 Braam composed Nopera, a sort of music theater piece in which the written parts could be performed at random and contained much room for improvisation, and the libretto was written in the Nothingyettish language. In 2012 Bik Bent Braam stopped and a septet named Flex Bent Braam took its place. In 2013 the first program \\"Lucebert\\" of that band was presented on stage and with an album. In 2015 eBraam recorded \\"The Extraordinary Love Story of Aye Aye and Fedor\\", with singer Dean Bowman as narrator, after Ana Isabel Ordonez's children's book, in a bigger project that involves also dance and fine art. 2016 Reeds & Deeds started, with Frans Vermeerssen, Alex Coke, Bo van de Graaf, Arjen Gorter and Makki van Engelen. This sextet plays the music of Roland Kirk and issued an album in 2019, \\"Live at JazzCase\\". In 2020 it will be 25 years ago Bik Bent Braam performed the program \\"The XIJZ of Bik Bent Braam\\". A special Latin version of this program will be touring during the anniversary year 2020 by the new 13-piece ensemble Son Bent Braam (including Angelo Verploegen, Jo√´l Botma, Ilja Reijngoud, Efe Erdem, Efra√Øm Trujillo, Bart van der Putten, Frans Vermeerssen, Jesse Schilderink, Aty de Windt, Andr√© Groen, Danny Rombout and Martin Gort entitled \\"El XYZ de Son Bent Braam\\".

Her drawings are composed of gouache on vellum and present two views of the Causeway from the east and west. These paintings show accurate details of the jointing forming the basalt columns of the Causeway. The paintings brought attention to the formation, and the popularity of Irish monument paintings boomed in their wake. Engravings were made by Francois Vivares between 1743 and 1744. Prints made from these engravings were popular in Europe and were widely circulated in scientific communities; in 1765 an entry for the Causeway appeared in volume 12 of the French Encyclop√©die which clearly relied on the engraving of Drury's paintings. A plate made from the engraving of Drury's \\"East Prospect\\" itself later appeared unattributed in a volume of plates published for the Encyclop√©die. It was included in the geology section along with two other plates depicting similar basalt formations in France, and included a caption by Nicolas Desmarest proposing, for the first time in print, that the structures were volcanic in origin.\\"Susanna Drury, the Causeway, and the Encyclop√©die, 1768\\" This was to help resolve a long-argued dispute on the origin of the basalts, and other igneous rocks, that had raged between the Neptunists and the Vulcanists. .

Pensionado Act  The word pensionado originated with the Spanish language. It means to receive a pension from the government. As the Pensionado Act started in 1903, the purpose was to \\"Educate and bind current and future Filipino leaders to the American colonial administration.\\" Filipinos, mostly males, that were sponsored by the act were able to continue their education abroad and learn about American culture. The United States government agreed to having Filipinos in the United States to acquire knowledge on Western culture and civilization. This program encouraged Filipinos to obtain education in the United States and return to the Philippines. The first year of the program there were about 20,000 applicants with only one hundred of Filipinos men ultimately selected to study abroad in the United States. About forty boys and eight girls were chosen each year in 1904 and 1905.Orosa, Mario. \\"The Philippine Pensionado Story.\\" Journal (2007). Students were spread across the United States to participate in higher education. ... The program, which ended in 1943 and sought to train future Philippine leaders in preparation for post-World War II independence, also fostered beliefs in the supremacy of U.S. institutions, language, and white culture as compared to traditional Philippine culture.

National Historical Institute. Retrieved 2010-12-30. Central Philippine University, founded by the American Baptists is the second American university in Asia. Education became a very important issue for the United States colonial government, since it allowed it to spread their cultural values, particularly the English language, to the Filipino people.Karnow, Stanley. In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines, Ballantine Books, Random House, Inc., March 3, 1990, 536 pages, Instruction in English language, and American history, lead to forming of a national identity and Filipino nationalism. Every child from age 7 was required to register in schools located in their own town or province. The students were given free school materials. There were three levels of education during the American period. The \\"elementary\\" level consisted of four primary years and 3 intermediate years. The \\"secondary\\" or high school level consisted of four years; and the third was the \\"college\\" or tertiary level. Religion was not part of the curriculum of the schools as it had been during the Spanish period. In some cases those students who excelled academically were sent to the U.S. to continue their studies and to become experts in their desired fields or professions. They were called \\"scholars\\" and \\"pensionados\\" because the government covered all their expenses. In return, they were to teach or work in government offices after they finished their studies. Some examples of these successful Filipino scholars were Judge Jos√© Abad Santos, Francisco Benitez, Dr. Honoria Acosta-Sison and Francisco Delgado. Many elementary and secondary schools from the Spanish era were recycled and new ones were opened in cities and provinces, among which there were normal, vocational, agricultural, and business schools. Among the most important colleges during American rule were: Philippine Normal School in 1901 (now Philippine Normal University) and other normal schools throughout the country such as Colegio Filipino (1900, now National University), Silliman Institute (1901, now Silliman University, Iloilo Normal School (1902, now West Visayas State University), Cebu Normal School (1902, now Cebu Normal University, Negros Oriental High School (1902), Capiz Home School (1904, now Filamer Christian University, the Echague Farm School (1918, now the Isabela State University) St. Paul College of Dumaguete (1904, now St. Paul University Dumaguete), Zamboanga Normal School in 1904 (now Western Mindanao State University), Jaro Industrial School (1905, now Central Philippine University), Instituto de Manila (1913, now University of Manila), Philippine Women's College (1919, now Philippine Women's University), and Institute of Accountancy (1928, now Far Eastern University. Examples of vocational schools are: the Philippine Nautical School, Manila Trade School (1901, now Technological University of the Philippines) and the Central Luzon Agriculture School. The University of the Philippines was also founded in 1908. Schools were also built in remote areas like Sulu, Mindanao, and the Mountain Provinces, where attention was given to vocational and health practice. Thomasites Volunteer American soldiers became the first teachers of the Filipinos. Part of their mission was to build classrooms in every place where they were assigned. The American soldiers stopped teaching only when a group of teachers from the U.S. came to the Philippines in June 1901. They came aboard the ship \\"Sheridan.\\" In August 1901, 600 teachers called Thomasites arrived. Their name derived from the ship they traveled on, the . The original batch of Thomasites was composed by 365 males and 165 females, who sailed from United States on July 23, 1901. The U.S. government spent about $105,000 for the expedition.\\"The Thomasites:An Army Like No Other\\", News.Ops.gov.ph October 12, 2003 More American teachers followed the Thomasites in 1902, making a total of about 1,074 stationed in the Philippines. Criticisms=Monroe Commission on Philippine Education The Monroe Commission on Philippine Education was created in 1925 with the aim of reporting on the effectiveness of the education in the Philippines during the period of U.S. annexation. It was headed by Paul Monroe, who at the time was the Director of the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, and it was composed by a total of 23 education professionals, mostly from the U.S. and some from the Philippines. During 1925 the Commission visited schools all throughout the Philippines, interviewing a total of 32,000 pupils and 1,077 teachers. The commission found that in the 24 years since the U.S. education system had been established, 530,000 Filipinos had completed elementary school, 160,000 intermediate school, and 15,500 high school. The Commission declared that although Filipino students were on the same level as their American counterparts in subjects like Math or Science, they lagged far behind in English-language related subjects. George Counts, a Yale professor and a member of the Commission wrote in 1925 in The Elementary School Journal that \\"Half of the children were outside the reach of schools. Pupil performance was generally low in subjects that relied on English, although the achievement in Math and Science was at par with the average performance of American school children...\\" Counts also described the Filipino children of the 1920s as handicapped because not only were they trying to learn new concepts in a foreign language but they were also being forced to do so from the point of view of a different culture, due to the fact that they were using materials originally designed for pupils in the United States. The report also informed that teacher training was inadequate and that 82 per cent of the pupils did not go beyond grade 4. Many of the problems identified were attributed to the attempt to impose an English-based education system in just one generation, concluding that \\"Upon leaving school, more than 99% of Filipinos will not speak English in their homes. Possibly, only 10% to 15% of the next generation will be able to use this language in their occupations. In fact, it will only be the government employees, and the professionals, who might make use of English.\\" Other recommendations of the Commission asking for a \\"curtailment of the type of industrial work found on schools\\" and the elimination of the General Sales Department that had been set up to distribute the sale of items made in schools, pushed the implementation of several changes in the educational system to try to prioritize on the instruction of the pupils to be taught over the teaching of \\"industrial\\" education that until then had been focusing on the production of handicrafts such as basketry for boys and embroidery for girls, farming techniques, and other skills deemed favorable for the future of the pupils.

Plot The Journal of Julius Rodman is a fictionalised account of the first expedition across the Western Wilderness, crossing the Rocky Mountains. The journal chronicled a 1792 expedition led by Julius Rodman up the Missouri River to the Northwest. This 1792 expedition would have made Rodman the first European to cross the Rocky Mountains. The detailed journal chronicles events of the most surprising nature, and recounts \\"the unparalleled vicissitudes and adventures experienced by a handful of men in a country which, until then, had never been explored by 'civilised man'.\\" Julius Rodman was an English emigrant who first settled in New York, then moved to Kentucky and Mississippi. His expedition which departed from Mills' Point up the Missouri River with several companions was described in a diary. The MS. of the diary was submitted by his heir, James E. Rodman. Rodman is accompanied on his expedition by Pierre, Alexander Wormley, Toby, a Virginian, Andrew Thornton, and the Greely brothers, John, Robert, Meredith, Frank, and Poindexter. The party is described as \\"mere travellers for pleasure\\", abandoning commercial or pecuniary motives. They traveled by canoe and by a thirty foot long keelboat which was bulletproof. The travelers described the White Cliffs of the Missouri: \\"The face of these remarkable cliffs, as might be supposed, is chequered with a variety of lines formed by the trickling of the rains upon the soft material, so that a fertile fancy might easily imagine them to be gigantic monuments reared by human art, and carved over with hieroglyphical devices.\\" In the final chapter, a ferocious attack by two grizzly bears on the expedition party is described: \\"We had scarcely time to say a word to each other before two enormous brown bears (the first we had yet encountered during the voyage) came rushing at us open-mouthed from a clump of rose-bushes.\\" Their fiercenss was detailed: \\"These animals are much dreaded by the Indians, and with reason, for they are indeed formidable creatures, possessing prodigious strength, with untamable ferocity, and the most wonderful tenacity of life.\\" A member of the party, Greely, is attacked and mauled by one of the bears. Rodman and another member, the Prophet, assist him. They shoot the bear but cannot stop the attack. Subsequently, Rodman and the Prophet are attacked. Cornered on the cliff, they are saved from death by Greely, who shoots the bear at point-blank range: \\"Our deliverer, who had fought many a bear in his life-time, had put his pistol deliberately to the eye of the monster, and the contents had entered his brain.\\" Publication 1947 cover of reprint by The Colt Press with colored wood engravings by Mallette Dean 1947 reprint title page by The Colt Press, San Francisco Six installments of the novel were published in Burton's Gentleman's Magazines January through June issues in 1840. At the time, Poe was a contributing editor of the journal. He was fired from the job in June 1840 by William Burton and refused to continue the novel.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. Checkmark Books, 2001. p. 119 The work was reprinted in 1947 by The Colt Press in San Francisco as a hardcover book with wood engravings by Mallette Dean and with an introduction by Jane Bissell Grabhorn. In 2008, Pushkin Press republished the novel in a new illustrated edition with an afterword by Michael David. In 2009, Chris Aruffo made an audiorecording of the novel as part of a series. Reception In 1840, members of the United States Senate believed the story to be a true account. Robert Greenhow (1800‚Äì1854), a native of Richmond, Virginia, whose family may have known Poe, wrote a paragraph about the work in U.S. Senate Document of the 26th Congress, 1st Session, Volume IV (1839‚Äì40), pages 140-141, entitled \\"Memoir, Historical and Political, on the Northwest Coast of North America, and the Adjacent Territories; Illustrated by a Map and a Geographical View of Those Countries\\". The document stated, \\"It is proper to notice here an account of an expedition across the American continent, made between 1791 and 1794, by a party of citizens of the United States, under the direction of Julius Rodman, whose journal has been recently discovered in Virginia, and is now in course of publication in a periodical magazine at Philadelphia.\\" Greenhow admitted that the full expedition had not yet been completely reported. This unintended \\"hoax\\" on the U.S. Senate suggests Poe's ability to add credibility to his fiction. In 1844, Greenhow's \\"Memoir\\" was expanded and reprinted in book form as The History of Oregon and California and Other Territories on the North-West Coast of North America. In its second edition, references to Julius Rodman were removed, implying Greenhow learned of his error.Jackson, David K. \\"Marginalia\\" from Poe Studies, vol.

PAL-TIN (acronym commonly shortened to PALTIN) was an initiative of the Bucharest-based MASTER Forum Association (started in 1994) to develop local youth councils in Romania along the lines of the youth council charter adopted by the European Union. Revised European Charter on the Participation of Young People in Local and Regional Life By 2007 the program included over 90 youth and child councils throughout Romania. History Following the popular uprising and overthrow of the country's communist dictatorship in 1989, a number of civic organizations were developed that focused on the promotion of democracy and the popular spread and implementation of democratic ideals. A number of these organizations banded together in the creation of an association called MASTER Forum focused on supporting the trends of building a civil society, initiatives of youth and youth associations. The founders consisted of European Union/Phare for Democracy Program, Solon Foundation from Switzerland, Fund for the Development of the Carpathian Euroregion, and the Civil Society Development Foundation. Out of this forum came the PAL-TIN (Youth Participation in Local Government) Project, the primary objective of which is the promotion of youth participation in public decisions about matters that concern them. The initiative is developed along the lines of the EU youth council charter. Resolution 237 from 1992 of the Permanent Conference of Local and Regional Authorities in Europe adopted the Charter on the Participation of Young People in Local and Regional Life in which it is affirmed that: \\"municipalities and other territorial communities will create adequate institutional conditions for the participation of the young people in decision-making and debates on problems of interest to them... will create and support youth councils that function as a structure of active participation...\\". Council Framework The youth council framework was designed to serve as: * A place where teenagers can express and dialogue among themselves and with local administration, decision-making factors on problems of interest to them; * A frame of activity conceived and accomplished by young people, at the level of their day by day existence, having the local community as central reference space; * And a place for practical learning of democratic citizenship, of expression, communication, dialogue, negotiation, decision-making and evaluation. The PAL- TIN Project is able to support the individual youth councils through: * Offering the existing documentation, translated or adapted; * Putting the evaluation studies regarding the functioning of the councils at the disposal of groups interested in the creation of youth councils so that difficulties can be avoided; * Providing consultant services to local administrations interested in getting involved in the creation of such councils; * Organizing training of volunteers willing to get involved in the creation of the councils; * Participating, along with the local coordinators, in the design and support of the activity of the local councils, providing assistance during the implementation of local projects; * Organizing experience-sharing meetings, seminars and workshops for the initiators of such councils; * Elaborating presentation materials, recommendations and documentation for the organization of elections for youth local councils.

He made his Rovers debut on 18 March 2005 and went on to make a total of 31 appearances in all competitions scoring 6 goals. McDonagh arrived at The Oval in January 2006 from Shamrock Rovers, and was one of former manager Roy Coyle's final signings before resigning. McDonagh scored his first goal for the club in a 3-2 success against Newry City at the Oval in March, this would be his only for the season. 2006/2007 was a mixed year for McDonagh, with consistency being the main hindrance to him becoming a favourite with the Glentoran crowd.

Career  Crockford purchased an Atari 8-bit computer in 1980 and wrote the game Galahad and the Holy Grail for the Atari Program Exchange (APX), which resulted in Chris Crawford hiring him at Atari, Inc. While at Atari, Crockford wrote another game, Burgers!, for APX and a number of experimental audio/visual demos that were freely distributed. After Warner Communications sold the company, he joined National Semiconductor. In 1984 Crockford joined Lucasfilm, and later Paramount Pictures. He became known on video game oriented listservs in the early 1990s after he posted his memoir \\"The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion\\" to a videogaming bulletin board. The memoir documented his efforts to censor the computer game Maniac Mansion to Nintendo's satisfaction so that they could release it as a cartridge, and Crockford's mounting frustrations as Nintendo's demands became more obscure and confusing.The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion: A Memoir by Douglas Crockford Together with Randy Farmer and Chip Morningstar, Crockford founded Electric Communities and was its CEO from 1994 to 1995.

The prevention paradox describes the seemingly contradictory situation where the majority of cases of a disease come from a population at low or moderate risk of that disease, and only a minority of cases come from the high risk population (of the same disease). This is because the number of people at high risk is small. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019 and 2020, the term \\"prevention paradox\\" was also used to describe the apparent paradox of people questioning steps to prevent the spread of the pandemic because the prophesied spread did not occur. This however is instead an example of a self-defeating prophecy.  Examples  For example, Rose describes the case of Down syndrome where maternal age is a risk factor. Yet, most cases of Down Syndrome will be born to younger, low risk mothers (this is true at least in populations where most women have children at a younger age). This situation is paradoxical because it is common and logical to equate high risk populations with making up the majority of the burden of disease. Another example could be seen in terms of reducing overall alcohol problems in a population. Although less serious, most alcohol problems are not found among dependent drinkers. Greater societal gain will be obtained by achieving a small reduction in alcohol misuse within a far larger group of 'risky' drinkers with less serious problems than by trying to reduce problems among a smaller number of dependent drinkers. The prevention paradox is a problem encountered when governments or organisations attempt to introduce a large scale intervention to improve health.

He was one of the most successful high school football coaches of all time, winning four Texas state championships and one national championship in the 1920s. Knute Rockne called Tyson \\"one of the finest coaches I ever met, college or high school\\". Career A native of Arkansas, Tyson enrolled at Addison-Randolph College in Waco, Texas, (later re-founded as Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas) in 1904, intending to become a doctor. He went to a football game, tried out for the team the next week and made the starting line-up. He also lettered in baseball. In 1908, Tyson graduated from Addison-Randolph, and went to Pritzker School of Medicine in Chicago to study medicine. While playing baseball there, he was reportedly offered a contract to pitch for a major league team, but turned it down. Returning to Texas, Tyson taught biology in Tyler to supplement his income while studying medicine. While at Tyler, the children recruited him as their \\"football supervisor\\". After teaching two more terms at Denison High School, Tyson finally decided to give up medicine for sports, when he became a biology teacher and football coach at Waco High School. Though starting his career with a 1‚Äì3‚Äì2 season in 1913, Tyson's Waco teams did not have a losing season in the following 27 years under his guidance. Their dominance, however, truly began in the 1920s. Waco played six straight championship games between 1922 and 1927, losing only two. In 1927, after beating Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin School of Chardon, Ohio, 44‚Äì12 in a postseason game, Waco was recognized as a mythical national champion. In a time when most teams relied on a basic offense run out of a short punt formation, Tyson revolutionized offensive tactics, developing a series of plays out of the single-wing formation, where one or both of the two backs receiving the snap would spin and cross paths with the remaining backs and ends. The so-called \\"spinner\\" was so effective, that Waco scored over a hundred points on nine occasions between 1922 1927. In 1927, the Tigers scored an average of 56 points per game‚Äîa record that stood until 1975 when Big Sandy High School scored 824 points for the season. Tyson's teams were also known for their defense. Playing only a regular-season schedule, the 1921 team was the first of three squads to allow no points in a season. From 1921 to 1927, Waco had 58 shutouts. The 3‚Äì0 state title loss to Abilene High School in 1923 was Waco's only scoring blemish. Led by Boody Johnson, Tommy Glover, Jack Sisco and Sam Coates, Waco's defense gave up just 156 points in seven seasons. Despite receiving several offers to coach college football teams, Tyson had no interest in leaving Waco. He attended and spoke at football clinics all over the country. Knute Rockne and Pop Warner routinely sought his opinions on offensive philosophy, and he was a favorite of reporters, who found him charismatic and humble and openly campaigned for major universities to hire him. In spring 1942, the Waco school board suddenly and unanimously voted to fire Tyson after an 8‚Äì2 season, two removed from a year he took the Tigers to the state finals. Tyson, a lifelong bachelor who never dated, was rumored to be \\"too intimate\\" with his players.

By ignoring the rapid evolution of computer technology, new programming languages, libraries and frameworks, editing and debugging tools, version control systems, and even software development methodologies that are continually being introduced to automate common tasks and potentially make programmer's life easier and thus more productive, real programmers claim their existing skills to be more efficient. Additionally, state of the art development practices from any given year are often unheard of, unused, or supported years/decades later and gives the real programmer's tribal knowledge the appearance of being a \\"miracle worker\\". Some programmers and managers who \\"grew up\\" on the older, still functioning systems, disdain these new innovations as coddling \\"unskilled\\" junior programmers by making the challenges of software development seem easier to the unskilled, but may seem more costly or unnecessary to real programmers. Those who had to learn to use (and were toughened by) the older tools and limitations are the \\"real programmers\\", and those who cannot survive without the newer automated assistance are derided as imposters, more costly, or unskilled. As a result, both the \\"real programmers\\" and the perceived unskilled \\"imposters\\" often need to \\"voluntarily\\" work longer hours using inadequate tools in an attempt to prove to management and other programmers their skills, worth, or the superiority of their established methods. This additional overhead to overcome technical debt might damage some programmers' health as a result of increased strain. Beliefs In 1980s \\"Real programmers\\" were believed to prefer working in low-level programming languages that offer little abstraction or insulation from the physical hardware, and to ignore structured programming practices in favor of hand- crafting their control flow. These techniques can access unique hardware features and surprising performance, but are often unforgiving of the smallest mistakes and could result in undocumented obfuscated code. \\"Real programmers\\" aren't supposed to make errors in their code, so primitive editors are adequate and the latest debugging tools are unnecessary. Documentation is also considered frivolous, as a \\"real programmer\\" should just read other skilled programmers' source code or manually inspect the contents of memory if he or she wants to understand how something works while an \\"unskilled\\" programmer might rely on an IDE. Many of these beliefs were described in the early 1980s essays \\"Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal\\" and \\"The Story of Mel,\\" which inspired many subsequent articles, webcomicsREAL programmers xkcd.com and in- jokes--with the exact defining features of a \\"Real Programmer\\" differing with time and place.

He played regular first team football for his first two seasons at Forest but then sustained a serious ankle injury, around the time of Forest's relegation in 1993, which kept him out for the whole of the following season, when Forest won promotion. He regained fitness and went on loan to Swindon Town in the 1994‚Äì95 season, with his place in the centre of defence at the City Ground now occupied by Colin Cooper. Having played a total of 85 games for Forest, Tiler joined Aston Villa for ¬£750,000 in October 1995. He sustained a ruptured hamstring after 70 minutes of his debut against Everton which took a full 10 months to heal. He then played a further 14 games for Villa before sealing a ¬£500,000 move back to his home town team Sheffield United. With Sheffield United he reached the 1996‚Äì97 First Division playoff final at Wembley against Crystal Palace, which the Blades lost in the last minute 1‚Äì0. After a short spell of 23 games and a ¬£750,000 transfer fee the commanding defender Tiler followed his old Blades boss Howard Kendall to Everton, where he played the remainder of that season helping keep the Goodison Park outfit in the Premiership. Walter Smith took over the reins the following season and his first team appearances were limited. He scored his only goal for Everton in a 2‚Äì1 loss at Southampton on 7 March 1998. In 1998 Tiler moved to Premiership side Charlton Athletic, again for ¬£750,000. He played 47 games for the club and spent a brief period on loan at Birmingham City before in March 2001 signing for Graham Rix at Portsmouth for ¬£250,000, where he stayed for a couple of seasons, scoring once in the league against Crystal Palace, before finally retiring from the game in 2003 due to injury. In his final season he contributed two appearances as Portsmouth won the First Division Championship and promotion to the Premier League.

He was the youngest child of the Liberal MP Duncan McLaren (1800‚Äì1886) and his third wife Priscilla Bright, a sister of the Radical MP John Bright. Two of his brothers, Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway and John also became Liberal Members of Parliament. Walter McLaren was married in April 1883 to Eva Muller. They became a powerful pair of women's rights advocates with Eva calling herself Mrs Eva McLaren and not the expected Mrs Walter McLaren. Eva stood successfully for public office as far as it was permitted at the time. She campaigned for further rights as treasurer of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors and Walter served on its successor organisation the Women's Local Government Society. Walter introduced a clause to the 1894 Local Government Act which extended the voting rights of married women.Linda Walker, ‚ÄòMcLaren , Eva Maria (1852/3‚Äì1921)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 accessed 12 Jan 2017 McLaren first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he stood as an \\"independent liberal\\" candidate for the Inverness district of Burghs, in Scotland. He had been nominated by the Free Church Constitutional Party, and polled strongly against the official Liberal Party candidate, taking 47.5% of the votes. At the 1886 general election he was elected in Crewe, where the sitting Liberal MP George Latham had not sought re-election. McLaren was re-elected in 1892, but lost his seat at the 1895 general election. He did not stand in 1900, when the seat was regained for the Liberals by James Tomkinson, but when Tomkinson died shortly after being re- elected at the January 1910 election, McLaren was the successful Liberal candidate in the resulting by-election. He held the seat until his own death in 1912, aged 59. Walter is buried with his parents in St Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh. Although the monument, lying on the east wall of the first south section under Edinburgh Castle, is huge, Walter is relegated to a simple footnote at the base of the stone.

The goal of retirement planning is to achieve financial independence. The process of retirement planning aims to: *Assess readiness-to-retire given a desired retirement age and lifestyle, i.e., whether one has enough money to retire *Identify actions to improve readiness-to-retire *Acquire financial planning knowledge *Encourage saving practices Obtaining a financial plan Producers such as a financial planner or financial adviser can help clients develop retirement plans, where compensation is either fee-based or commissioned contingent on product sale; see Professional certification in financial services. Such an arrangement is sometimes viewed as in conflict with a consumer's interest, and that the advice rendered cannot be without bias, or at a cost that justifies its value. Consumers can now elect a do it yourself (DIY) approach. For example, retirement web-tools in the form of a calculator, mathematical model or decision support system are available online. A web-based tool that allows client to fully plan, without human intervention, might be considered a producer. Key motivations of the DIY trend are many of the same arguments for lean manufacturing, a constructive alteration of the relationship between producer and consumer. Personal planning * Preparing working environment. * Prepare mentally and plan to involve in hobbies and develop new interests to be engaged with retirement life. * Plan and prepare for the transition impact of retirement with home life. * Plan how active you want to be when you reach retirement age, engage in part-time, contract work or in activities that doesn't overextend oneself. * Stay connected with the community. * Learning to appreciate leisure, moderating work-life balance and to say no without regrets. http://www.lgma.ca/assets/Resources~and~Publications/Documents/Newsletters/2012~Exchange~Magazine/Exchange-2012-June.pdf Modeling and limitations Retirement finances touch upon distinct subject areas or financial domains of client importance, including: investments (i.e., stocks, bonds, mutual funds); real estate; debt; taxes; cash flow (income and expense) analysis; insurance; defined benefits (e.g., social security, traditional pensions). From an analytic perspective, each domain can be formally characterized and modeled using a different class representation, as defined by a domain's unique set of attributes and behaviors. Domain models require definition only at a level of abstraction necessary for decision analysis. Since planning is about the future, domains need to extend beyond current state description and address uncertainty, volatility, change dynamics (i.e., constancy or determinism is not assumed). Together, these factors raise significant challenges to any current producer claim of model predictability or certainty.  Monte Carlo method The Monte Carlo method is the most common form of a mathematical model that is applied to predict long-term investment behavior for a client's retirement planning. Its use helps to identify adequacy of client's investment to attain retirement readiness and to clarify strategic choices and actions. Yet, the investment domain is only a financial domain and therefore is incomplete. Depending on client context, the investment domain may have very little importance in relation to a client's other domains‚Äîe.g., a client who is predisposed to the use of real estate as a primary source of retirement funding. Other models Contemporary retirement planning models have yet to be validated in the sense that the models purport to project a future that has yet to manifest itself. The criticism with contemporary models are some of the same levied against Neoclassical economics. The critic argues that contemporary models may only have proven validity retrospectively, whereas it is the indeterminate future that needs solution. A more moderate school believes that retirement planning methods must further evolve by adopting a more robust and integrated set of tools from the field of complexity science. Recent research has explored the effects of the elimination of capital income taxes on saving-for-retirement opportunities and its impact on government debt.Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, \\"On Efficiently Financing Retirement\\", November 2011.

It is located in the village Bhubneshwar. Legend and folklore have it that this cave enshrines Lord Shiva and thirty three koti demigods [33 types and not crore]. The cave is 160 m long and 90 feet deep from the point of entrance. Limestone rock formations have created various spectacular stalactite and stalagmite figures of various hues and forms. This cave has a narrow tunnel- like opening which leads to a number of caves. The cave is fully electrically illuminated. Built by the flow of water, Patal Bhuvaneshwar is not just one cave, rather a series of caves within caves. \\"He who wants to feel the presence of eternal power should come to the sacred Bhuvneshwar situated near the confluence of Ramganga, Sarayu and Gupt-Ganga.\\" -Manaskhanda, Skandapuran, whose 800 verses refer to Patal Bhuvaneshwar Legend Of the Cave The first human to discover this cave was Raja Ritupurna who was a king in Surya Dynasty who was ruling Ayodhya during the Treta Yuga. The story starts with Ritupurna and King Nala. It is said that once, King Nala was defeated by his wife, Queen Damayanti. In order to escape his wife‚Äôs prison Nala requested Ritupurna to hide him. Ritupurna took him to the forests of the Himalayas and asked him to stay there. While going back home he was fascinated by a deer which ran into woods and went after it. He could not find it and took rest under a tree. He had a dream where the deer was asking Ritupurna not to chase him. His sleep broke and as he woke up and went to a cave where a guard was standing. After enquiring about the cave he was allowed to go inside. Right at the entrance, Ritupurna met Sheshnag who agreed to take him through the cave. It carried him on its hood. He saw the marvels of Gods taking place inside. He saw all the 33-koti (33 types of god not 33 cror ) gods and goddesses including Lord Shiva himself. It is said that after his visit, the cave was closed for ages with a slight prediction in the Skandpurana that it will be reopened again in Kali Yuga. Shankarcharya in Kali Yuga, during his visit to Himalayas re-discovered this cave. Since then regular worship and offering are being done at this place. History According to belief King Rituparna of the Sun dynasty (Surya Vansha) discovered the cave in Treta Yuga. Adi Shankaracharya visited this cave in 1191 AD. That was the beginning of the modern pilgrimage history, at Patal Bhuvaneshwar.Patal Bhuvaneshwar: The shrine beneath ‚Äì Tourism pamphlet published by Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board, Dehradun. The journey inside the cave has to be carried in feeble lights, holding protective iron chains. The Stone formations of Sheshnag can be seen, holding earth, heaven the world beneath. ‚ÄòHavan‚Äô (fire sacrifice) is performed in a dimly lit, solemn atmosphere, under the spell of holy chants. You‚Äôll also be impressed by theto visit these parts form the celestial heights of His abode in Kailash. The cave, it is believed, is connected by an underground route to Mount Kailash.Uttarakhand ‚ÄòThe abode of Gods‚Äô Published by Nest and Wings Ed. A.P. Agarwala 2009-10 page 218 it‚Äôs believed that Pandavas, the ‚ÄòMahabharat‚Äô heroes proceeded towards their last journey in the Himalayas after meditating here, in front of Lord Shiva. This hidden pilgrimage situated at 1,350 m above sea level is mainly dedicated to Lord Shiva.Almost every god that you would have heard of resides in this mystifying cave. It is also believed that you can worship at Patal Bhuvaneshwar is equivalent to worshipping at Char Dham of Uttarakhand. The priest family, the Bhandaris are performing religious rites at Patal Bhuvaneshwar since the time of the Adi Shankaracharya. More than 20 generations in the line. They are a treasure house of legends, lores, anecdotes and information about this holy place. It is also believed that this cave is internally connected to the four abodes /seats (Char Dham). According to one belief, the original head of lord Ganesha which was cut down by lord Shiva, is situated here who creates obstacles for bad people to improve, popularly known as \\"Vighnakarta\\". Inscription outside the Temple \\"This awesome cave is believed to be as old as the earth itself. It has been mentioned in detail in the 103 chapter of Manaskhand of \\"Skanda Purana\\". The first human who entered this cave was king \\"Rituparna\\" of Suraya Dynasty during the Treta Yuga. It is said that during his visit, he had encountered several demons and \\"Sheshnaag\\" himself acted as his guide.One can see the gateway of the great ages in Patal Bhuvaneshwar. There are four entrances inside the cave named as ‚ÄòRandwar‚Äô ‚ÄòPaapdwar‚Äô, ‚ÄòDharamdwar‚Äô and ‚ÄòMokshadwar‚Äô. The Paapdwar was closed soon after the death of Ravana and the Randwar, literally, the road to war, was closed down after the great Mahabharata war. At present only two gateways are opened. You can see the tongue of Kali Bhairav, Aravati of Indra, hairs of Lord Shiva and several other wonders inside the caves of Patal Bhuvaneshwar. In Dvapara Yuga this cave was rediscovered by the Pandavas. In Kali Yuga, Adishankar Acharya consecrate this cave and since 1191, this has been a place of visit, both for sightseeing and worship.\\" Places to visit The motorable road ends half a kilometer away from the cave entrance. You have to descend nearly 100 steps into this narrow cave, to reach the sanctum sanctorum, which gives an overwhelming feeling that you‚Äôre entering the centre of the earth. Each stone, each stalagmite within each cave or doorway, in magnificent erection reveals the story of Hindu pantheon in the shapes of Gods, Goddesses, saints and known mythological characters. Places to stay Patal Bhuvaneshwar has emerged as an interesting area for tourists to visit and in the vicinity of the caves there are a few small hotels available for staying. Good Indian food and also Kumauni food is available there. Hotels are also available in the nearby town of Gangolihat. After visiting the caves one has an option to move to nearby other towns also namely Berinag and Chaukori. From these places a picturesque view of Himalaya can be seen. There is another hotel which is named as Hotel Bhuvaneshwari which provides accommodation at reasonable cost but in preferred Kumauni cultured based welcome. Patal Bhuvaneshwar is quite reachable by tri junction of Seraghat and again can be connected to another sacred pilgrim Jageshwar Dhaam directly via Seraghat-Naini motor road. Jageshwar can be covered via visiting small villages like Dhankhet, Salla Bhatkot, Nali, Kunj Kimola etc places in between on the bank of beautiful river Sarayu.

He was considered by many to be the major force in the revival of Chinese Buddhism. (Chinese) While Nan was regarded by many in China as one of the most influential Chan Buddhist teachers, he was little known outside the Chinese cultural sphere.Scharmer, Otto, and Senge, Peter.

In his youth, Nan received a classical education that included various Confucian and Daoist works, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, literature, calligraphy, poetry, and other subjects. In his youth at the age of 18, he became the provincial martial arts champion after studying several Chinese martial arts including swordsmanship with the jian. Nan studied social welfare at Jinling University (now merged with Nanjing University), and later went on to teach at the Republic of China Military Academy in Nanjing. In the late 1930s at the age of 21 years, Nan became a military commander at the border regions of Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan during the Second Sino-Japanese War.Master Nan and his teachings There, he led a local group of 30,000 men against the Japanese invasion.Nan Huai-Chin.

Florham Park: Primordia, 2004  Buddhist practice  While still young, Nan left his military career so that he could commit himself fully to his study of Buddhism and to meditation. In 1942 at age 24, he went on a three-year meditation retreat in the Emei Mountains. It is said that it was there that he verified his experiences against the Chinese Buddhist canon. During this time, Nan's primary teacher was Yuan Huanxian (Ë¢ÅÁÖ•‰ªô; 1887 ‚Äì 1966). In 1945, Nan went to seek out the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. The 9th Gangkar Rinpoche (Ë≤¢Âô∂Ê¥ª‰Ωõ; 1893 ‚Äì 1957), a high-ranking tulku of the Kagyu school, also verified Nan's experiences, giving him the title \\"Vajra Master.\\"Yuan, Margaret.

Nan's books have achieved a great deal of popularity in mainland China and Taiwan. In total, more than 20 million copies of his books have been sold in Chinese-speaking countries. Some of his more popular works have gone to a 20th printing in Taiwan and his works on Confucianism are used as standard university references in the mainland and Taiwan. Thomas Cleary, who has translated several of his books into English, has written the following about Nan's works and methodology:Master Nan book review \\"The Cultivation of Practice\\" translated by J.C. Cleary In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nan mediated secret cross-strait communications between the mainland China and Taiwan.Bercovitch, Jacob, Kwei-Bo Huang, Chung-Chien Teng. Conflict Management, Security and Intervention in East Asia. 2008. pp. 43-44 Two of Nan's students were close confidants of Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui, and Nan was approached by his student Jia Yibin about creating a communication channel between Lee Teng-hui and mainland China's President Yang Shangkun. Both Jia and Nan mediated cross-straight negotiations, and successfully realized secret chamber meetings between special envoys. In the early 1990s, Nan changed his place of residence from Taiwan to Hong Kong. Some secret cross-strait meetings were held at Nan's private residence in Hong Kong. In January 1992, Nan signed a contract with the Chinese government and invested 92 million RMB in the Jinhua‚ÄìWenzhou Railway, which is the first joint-stock railway in China. In 2004, Nan returned to the mainland near Suzhou. Nan died at the age of 94 on September 29, 2012.

Once established in the country, companies are allocated a Relationship Manager with the skills to help grow the business and are offered a relocation service that helps their executives settle there. IBW Structure IBW provide the trade and investment arm of the Welsh Government. Established in 2006, it brought together the responsibilities of the former Welsh Development Agency and Wales Trade International. Sitting under the Department for the Economy and Transport (DE&T;) IBW is tasked with developing international trade, and attracting inward investment, relocation and international collaboration. Track record IBW claims it has an impressive track record with Wales being one of Europe‚Äôs most successful investment locations. With a population of 2.9 million and a workforce of 1.3 million, Wales has attracted over ¬£16.8 billion of capital investment and over 282,000 jobs have been created or safeguarded through inward investment (between 1983 and March 2008). Over 500 international companies are located in the country including many of the world‚Äôs largest multinationals such as Ford, EDS and Alcatel. Area covered IBW offer support to companies looking at Wales as a business destination for expansion/relocation as well as supporting the companies located in the country with their international trade requirements. *Inward Investment - project management support to advise companies on all aspects of relocation from grants and skilled workforce availability through to property searches and a relocation service for business people under the ‚ÄúWelcome to Wales‚Äù programme. *International Trade - services for both native Welsh companies and international business looking for a trade partner in Wales, with support from advisors. IBW provide support tailored to company import and export needs. Criticism In July 2009, using information obtained from a Freedom of Information request to the Welsh government, the Welsh Liberal Democrats criticised International Business Wales officials for running up a bill of ¬£750,000, on 35 different corporate credit card accounts for the year June 2008 to end of May 2009, at the tax- payers expense. Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams AM said: :\\"In the middle of a recession it's disgusting to know that public officials are flying first class, staying in the most expensive hotels, eating in the best restaurants - all at the swipe of the Welsh credit card.\\"BBC Wales News: \\"Civil servants' ¬£750k cards bill\\" 13.07.09 First Minister Rhodri Morgan at first refuted the allegation. He later publicly apologised in a letter to Kirsty Williams and said that he had been misled by IBW officials, whom he had believed at the time: :\\"I stated, on the clear and explicit advice from the relevant senior officials that no officials from IBW (International Business Wales) had flown first class. Today I have learned that this is not the case. I apologise for having misled you and the wider public.\\"BBC Wales: Letter from First Minister Rhodri Morgan to Kirsty Williams AM, 15 August 2009. He added that he was setting up an investigation and independent review: :\\"I need hardly say how disturbed I am by this latest information now to hand. I am instructing the Permanent Secretary to undertake an immediate and thorough investigation and audit of IBW's expenditure and audit systems. This review will be led from outside the Assembly Government.\\" Support Following the July 2009 press coverage a group of Welsh exporters have shown their support for International Business Wales, calling on politicians to \\"stop playing politics\\" with the organisation. Malcolm Duncan, Managing Director of Blaenavon-based Super Rod, who heads up the support group said: :\\"I understand the need for the public to be kept informed about the activities of any Government department. But what does worry me is when politicians start to play politics with these departments, that could ultimately have a detrimental effect on both business and our economy as a whole.\\" Wales Online: \\"Exporters reject attack on IBW\\" 15.08.09 \\"Economic Renewal: a new direction\\" On Monday 5 July 2010 the Welsh Assembly Government announced plans to transform the way it supports businesses and the Welsh economy. \\"Economic Renewal: a new direction\\" is a vision to make Wales \\"one of the best places in the world to live, to work and to thrive\\".

The toxin is naturally found in some cheeses.  Introduction  Sterigmatocystin is a toxic metabolite structurally closely related to the aflatoxins, and consists of a xanthone nucleus attached to a bifuran structure. Sterigmatocystin is mainly produced by the fungi Aspergillus nidulans and A. versicolor. It has been reported in mouldy grain, green coffee beans and cheese although information on its occurrence in foods is limited. It appears to occur much less frequently than the aflatoxins, although analytical methods for its determination have not been as sensitive until recently, and so it is possible that small concentrations in food commodities may not always have been detected. Although it is a potent liver carcinogen similar to aflatoxin B1, current knowledge suggests that it is nowhere near as widespread in its occurrence. If this is the true situation it would be justified to consider sterigmatocystin as no more than a risk to consumers in special or unusual circumstances. A number of closely related compounds such as o-methyl sterigmatocystin are known, and some may also occur naturally.  Chemical and Physical Properties  Sterigmatocystin forms pale yellow needles and that are readily soluble in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, benzene, and chloroform. Sterigmatocystin reacts with a hot solution of potassium hydroxide and ethanol and is easily methylated by methyl iodide. Treatment with ethanol in acid produces dihydroethoxysterigmatocystin.  Toxicity and Importance The toxic effects of sterigmatocystin are much the same as those of aflatoxin B1. It is thus considered as a potent carcinogen, mutagen, and teratogen. It is less acutely toxic to rodents and monkeys but appears to be slightly more toxic to zebra fish. The LD50 in mice is in excess of 800 mg/kg. The 10-day LD50 in Wistar rats is 166 mg/kg in males, 120 mg/kg in females, and 60-65 mg/kg for ip. administration in males. The ip. 10-day LD50 for vervet monkeys is 32 mg/kg. Chronic symptoms include induction of hepatomas in rats, pulmonary tumours in mice, renal lesions and alterations in the liver and kidneys of African Green monkeys. Rats fed 5-10 mg/kg of sterigmatocystin for two years showed a 90% incidence of liver tumours. It has been suggested that sterigmatocystin is about 1/10 as potent a carcinogen as aflatoxin B1. Toxic effects of sterigmatocystin-fed laboratory animals have included kidney and liver damage and diarrhoea. Skin and hepatic tumours are induced in rats by dermal application. Cattle exhibiting bloody diarrhoea, loss of milk production and in some cases death were found to have ingested feed containing Aspergillus versicolor and high levels of sterigmatocystin of about 8 mg/kg. The acute toxicity, carcinogenicity, and metabolism of sterigmatocystin has been compared with those for aflatoxin and several other hepatotoxic mycotoxins. The IARC-classification of sterigmatocystin is group 2B, which means it is carcinogenic in other species and is possibly carcinogenic to humans, but that a definitive link between human exposure and cancer has not been proven.  Products affected and Natural Occurrence  The occurrence of sterigmatocystin in raw materials and foods has not been reported often. The instances reported have usually been on mouldy, or poor quality materials such as wheat, maize, animal feed, hard cheese, pecan nuts and green coffee beans. While this lack of information may be due to deficiencies in the analytical methods, where surveys of good quality products have been carried out with reliable methodology, sterigmatocystin has rarely if ever been found. However, further assurance is required before sterigmatocystin can finally be dismissed as a risk because A. versicolor has been isolated frequently from cereals, grain products, fruits and marmalade, dried meat products and grapefruit juice. Relatively high levels of sterigmatocystin have been formed in bread, cured ham and salami after inoculation with A. versicolor. More than in food, sterigmatocystin is frequently found in water-damaged buildings *.  Sampling and Analysis  Methods for extraction of sterigmatocystin have been commonly based on a mixture of acetonitrile and 4% aqueous potassium chloride. Methods for detection using TLC are not very sensitive having a limit of detection in the range 20-50 microgrammes/kg. TLC plates must be sprayed with aluminium chloride and heated. Analytical methods for the determination of sterigmatocystin have been reported using HPLC but again these are not very sensitive because of lack of UV absorbance or fluorescence, although a post column reaction with aluminium chloride has been used to increase sensitivity. More recently, methods using HPLC linked with atmospheric pressure ionisation mass spectrometric detection have been developed for foods such as cheese, bread and corn products.  Stability and Persistence  There appear to be no reports about the stability of sterigmatocystin, other than in solution, where it is similar to the aflatoxins. There is one report that phosphine gas significantly depresses the formation of sterigmatocystin when cereals are inoculated with A. versicolor.  Legislation and Control  No country has legislation for sterigmatocystin. Natural occurrence appears to be infrequent although only a limited number of surveys have been carried out. Soon after it was recognised as a highly toxic compound, the California Department of Health Services used TD50 values from the Cancer Potency Database to produce ‚Äòno significant risk‚Äô intake levels for humans. The level resulting was 8 microgrammes/kg body weight/day for a 70 kg adult  See also  * Aspergillus * Dermatoxin * Mycotoxin  External links  * Chemical explanation by European Mycotoxin Awareness Network *PubChem Entry Category:Food safety Category:IARC Group 2B carcinogens Category:Xanthones Category:Natural phenols Category:Mycotoxins Category:Aspergillus Category:Phenol ethers ","title":"Sterigmatocystin"},{"id":"10053077","text":"Leilah Assun√ß√£o Botucatu, S√£o Paulo Leilah Assun√ß√£o, or Leilah Assump√ß√£o (born Maria de Lourdes Torres de Assun√ß√£o), is a Brazilian dramatist, actress and writer.

Fala Baixo Sen√£o Eu Grito along with her two preceding plays, Jorginho, o mach√£o and Roda cor de Roda focus majorly on the stereotypes of the middle class and emphasize that conformity to these stereotypes is required. She openly depicts the majority of her characters as stuck in their current lifestyles, unable to break away from the status quo. One commodity of her first three works is that one or more of the characters eventually break free, but not in the traditional way one would think. They break free in regards to their imaginations/fantasies. For a short time period, they are able to fantasize and imagine themselves living in a world outside of the social norms. Overall, she wrights these plays to target the repressions society‚Äôs moral standards place on people and the dissatisfaction of life that is likely to come with these repressions. Fala Baixo Sen√£o Eu Grito (1969) focuses on a middle-aged woman with a very boring, standard lifestyle. One night, an intruder breaks into her house with a gun and proceeds to insult her and destroy her apartment. He forces the woman to come with him on a fantasy adventure in which the woman breaks away from her dull life and creates an ideal one. She enjoys the experience up until she remembers she has responsibilities to attend to at a local department store. This results in her screaming for help, unable to ignore the obligations of her daily life. Jorginho, o mach√£o (1973) describes the dilemma of a young man who is pressured by his family to marry and join the family business. He rebels by fleeing to study at the University of S√£o Paulo and then by continuing to fantasize there about what he wants his life to be like. This behavior does not help the conflict with his parents, resulting in attempted suicide. Roda cor de Roda (1973) entails the story of a housewife rebelling against her husband after she has found out he has been cheating. The results in the fantasies of role reversals, where all three of them take turns being the breadwinner, the prostitute, and the homemaker. These role changes result in many opportunities and freedoms for the characters, but also the realizations of the limitations of each role.

He is equally well known for hosting the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful interactive DVD game Pub Quiz: Hosted by Vince Earl. In it, he deploys his famous wit and charm to crack jokes and ask questions in such a way that it creates a convivial, pub-like atmosphere. He was involved in the Merseybeat scene of the 1960s as singer with the Vince Earl and the Talismen, and Vince Earl & the Attractions. He also played in the band \\"Rory Storm and the Hurricanes\\" and The Wirral band The Zero's who played in the Majestic nightclub Conway street Birkenhead in the early 1960s. He is a stand up comedian who appeared on the Granada Television show The Comedians before landing the Brookside part. As Frank in the film No Surrender his performance was both menacing and hilarious at the same time. He also appeared in Boys from the Blackstuff. In 2001, while still appearing in Brookside, Earl appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank. In November 2007, Earl returned to the set of Brookside in West Derby, Liverpool for an interview with ITV Local News to celebrate 25 years since the show started on Channel 4. He showed reporters around the Close, showing them his character's house, and the infamous patio where Trevor Jordache was found. Michael Starke, who played Sinbad Sweeney, also featured in the interview from the set of his new soap home at Coronation Street. He is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. In 2010, he was hospitalised with Goodpasture's syndrome which resulted in the need for regular dialysis. In the summer of 2012, he successfully underwent a kidney transplant. Earl has gone on record as saying that his favourite scene of Brookside was a breakfast scene filmed entirely in one shot. Earl's character, Ron, sat in the centre of the scene as various other characters attempted to steal his breakfast, ultimately leading Ron to exclaim: \\"Hey! Where's me tea gone?\\". Earl has also declared that he prefers stand-up to acting as he relishes the 'immediate feedback' offered by the former.

The name of the dog comes from the West Frisian Wetterh√ªn meaning \\"water dog.\\" Plural of Wetterhoun is Wetterhounen in Dutch. The breed may also be called the Otterhoun (not to be confused with the Otterhound) or Dutch Spaniel, although it is not a Spaniel-type dog.  Appearance  The Wetterhoun is a medium- sized dog between 55 and 59 centimeters (21.6-23 inches) at the withers. They weigh between 25 and 35 kilos (55 and 77 pounds). Their coat is thick and curly except for the head, ears and legs, where the coat is smoother; the water repellant coat is described as having a greasy feel. Coat colour may be solid black or brown, or black with white, or brown with white, with or without white ticking or roan marks. The texture of the coat should not be woolly, as such fur will not resist water. The ears are low set and hang flat to the head, and the tail curls tightly over the back. The breed has an unusual, somewhat grim expression due to the shape of the eyes,F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale which marks it as different from other dog breeds.History in brief (in Dutch)History in English  History  The ancestral type of the Wetterhoun was developed at least 400 years ago in the Dutch province of Fryslan. The origins of the Wetterhoun are conjectured to be from Gypsy dogs, crossed with an indigenous Frisian dog, perhaps the Old Water Dog, a type which is now extinct.Grandjean, Dominique, DVM. The Royal Canin Dog Encyclopedia. Paris, France: Aniwa Publishing, 2000. Dogs of this type were kept for the difficult and dangerous hunting of fitch (Mustela putorius) and otter (Lutra lutra) in the water. The dogs were also used for retrieving waterfowl and as watch dogs. Although the dogs almost disappeared during World War II, fanciers were able to bring the breed back through careful breeding, and it is gaining in popularity. A Wetterhoun puppy Databases are maintained by the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Stabij- en WetterhounenNederlandse Vereniging voor Stabij- en Wetterhounen (in Dutch) (Club for the Stabij and Wetterhoun) and De Wetterhoun Vereniging NederlandThe Frisian Water Dog Association Netherlands for understanding pedigrees and computing inbreeding coefficients. Internationally the breed is recognised by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in the Water Dogs section of Group 8. The United Kennel Club recognises the breed in its Gundog Group. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses and promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.  Temperament  This breed is an excellent gun dog, effective as both a land and water retriever, however its strong will and natural guarding abilities make early training a requirement.Fogle, Bruce. The New Encyclopedia of the Dog. New York: Dorling Kindersley, 2000. The breed standard describes the breed's temperament as reserved and \\"an ideal guard- dog\\". though never aggressive, which makes it an excellent family-dog. Although described as \\"strong willed\\" the Wetterhoun is never stubborn or wilfully disobedient. Perseverance is a much better term, because they finish what they started, whatever it takes. Imperturbable they finish what they think to be their task. Thereby the breed is sensitive and should never be treated or trained harshly. Brought-up and used to children, they are tolerant to children to the point where the dog should be protected against the children instead the other way around  References  External links  * Search The Open Directory Project (DMOZ) links for clubs and information about the Wetterhoun Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in the Netherlands Category:Gundogs Category:Water dogs Category:Rare dog breeds ","title":"Wetterhoun"},{"id":"10053133","text":"Socialist Nationalist Galician flag, also called Bandeira da P√°tria or Estreleira Galicia within the Iberian peninsula. Map of Galician Comarcas (shires) Roadsign at the Galician-Portuguese border where Espanha - n√£o √© Galiza (\\"Spain - is not Galicia\\") can be read Galician nationalism is a form of nationalism found mostly in Galicia, which asserts that Galicians are a nation and that promotes the cultural unity of Galicians. The political movement referred to as modern Galician nationalism was born at the beginning of the twentieth century from the idea of Galicianism.  Ideology  Historians, geographers and ethnologists recognize the existence of a Galician ethnic group, forming a singular unit in a specific territory.Map from Eurominority depicting European national minorities However, this is a wide conceptualization that in political terms allows many possible variants. Inside Galician nationalism two main ideological currents can be found: * Autonomist: claims for an extended autonomy of Galicia, further devolution and (in occasions) the transformation of Spain into a federal state where Galicia would eventually achieve self-determination. * Pro-independence: campaigns for immediate and total independence from Spain. Both autonomists and \\"independentists\\" have points in common, such as the defence and promotion of Galician culture and language, with some defending reintegrationism with Portuguese language and culture. Both also argue for the official and unequivocal recognition of Galicia as a nation and the defense of Galician speakers outside administrative Galician territory, in Galician-speaking areas of the Spanish regions of Asturias and Castile and Le√≥n. It is often considered that the ideological framework of contemporary Galician nationalism was set in Alfonso Daniel Rodr√≠guez Castelao's key work Sempre em Galiza (lit. \\"Always in Galicia\\"), published in 1944.  Political nationalism in society  Galician nationalist candidates received 19% of the vote in the elections of 2005 and 16% in 2009. From 2005 to 2009 Galicia was ruled by a coalition government between the Socialists' Party of Galicia (PSdeG-PSOE) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG). Unlike in other Spanish autonomous communities the conservative and pro-Spanish People's Party of Galicia (PPdeG) includes galicianism as one of its ideological principles.Facsimile discussing PP's galeguidade (\\"Galicianness\\"), by Frans Schrijver Even the Spanish Socialist Party has a quite strong regional flavour in Galicia.Galician President P√©rez Touri√±o commenting Galicianism, from newspaper A Nosa TerraGalician President P√©rez Touri√±o (PSdG) discussing Galicianism, from online newspaper Xornal.com This issue somehow explains electoral behaviour in Galicia and why nationalist parties have a reduced representation when compared to Catalonia or the Basque Country, as voters in Galicia may choose to go for Spanish parties promoting Galicianism depending on the circumstances. Spanish parties in Catalonia and Basque Country, namely the Partido Popular, do not have such a strong regional identity, but the Socialist Party in Catalonia has recently incorporated nationalist elements in its political discourse. A possible explanation for this political behaviour in pro-Spanish parties is that Galician identity is so embedded in Galicians that any political party willing to participate in elections must at least show some degree of interest in the promotion of Galicianism, but how it is done may vary greatly. The Bloque Nacionalista Galego is itself a coalition of parties, which endorse independence, but not all individual members and parallel organizations within it support that idea.Members of BNG's internal organization Movemento Pola Base displaying a banner where \\"Independence and Socialism\\" can be read At present, BNG claims for sovereignty and independence, both political and economic. Other nationalist parties stand for outright independence, and until recently they only had representatives in local councils and not in the Galician Parliament. In the 2012 election the newly formed Galician Left Alternative, which includes pro-independence groups, overtook the BNG in Parliament, winning 9 seats. The present Galician Statute of Autonomy (1981) defines Galicia as a nationality.

Originally, the Percival Q.6 was a civil transport but It was used during the Second World War by the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy as a communications and liaison aircraft. It was a twin-engine, low-wing monoplane with a tailwheel undercarriage. Design and development The Percival Type-Q was Percival's first twin-engine aircraft. It was constructed of wood, with plywood and fabric covering. It had a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage, with faired mainwheels, although four of the production machines would be equipped with retractable undercarriage. Two versions were designed: the Q.4, a four-seat executive transport, and the Q.6, a six-seat feederliner. The Q.4 was not built. The prototype Q.6, registration G-AEYE, first flew on 14 September 1937 at Luton Airport. Production started in 1938, and the first production aircraft, registered G-AFFD, was delivered to Sir Philip Sassoon on 2 March 1938. Operational history A small number were exported, including one to the King Ghazi I of Iraq, two to the Lithuanian Ministry of Communications, one to the Australian Civil Aviation Board and two to the Egyptian government in military camouflage. A total of 27 aircraft were built (one prototype and 26 production aircraft). Ex RAF Petrel operated in the UK in 1949 by Ductile Steels as an executive transport The Royal Air Force bought seven aircraft for communications duties under Air Ministry Specification 25/38; these were unofficially named Petrel. The Egyptian government bought two Q.6s. In the early months of the Second World War, most of the civil Q.6s were requisitioned for service with the RAF and RN. Two Q.6s of the Lithuanian National Airline were impressed by the Soviet Air Forces in 1940. With one exception, all the civilian Q.6s served with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Between 1946 and 1947, four requisitioned Q.6s and three Petrels were sold to civilian buyers. These were operated by small UK airlines, as executive transports and flown by private pilot owners.

It has also included most of the Allegheny River, Beaver River and Youghiogheny River valleys. Most of the Pittsburgh metro area is considered part of \\"Steel Valley\\", as well as most of the Weirton-Steubenville-Wheeling Ohio/West Virginia, Morgantown/Fairmont West Virginia and East Liverpool/Youngstown/Mercer/New Castle Ohio and Pennsylvania metro areas. To locals in these regions the \\"Steel Valley\\" refers to towns and cities along the river shore, the school district and valley areas and not always the suburbs and cities at higher elevations, though the term has been used for the entire region. The Youngstown area of Ohio (as well as the Wheeling/Steubenville/Weirton area) though geographically and demographically connected to the \\"Steel Valley\\" retain many distinctions from the Steel Valley centered in Pittsburgh. History and heritage Up until the post Civil War era, most of this valley was farm land and small surface or near-surface mining areas. Starting with the industrial boom that the Civil War demanded, the area rich in coal (a key industrial component for steel and iron making and thus the linchpin for most major industrial concerns) grew rapidly along the rivers of the region. Among the men that the valley and its resources made famously wealthy were: Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, Henry Clay Frick, Henry Heinz, George Westinghouse, and Charles Schwab. Along with great wealth also came great waves of immigration into the area from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe as well as the great poverty of the non-unionized workers. In 1891 American labor peace was broken with the uprising of steel workers in Homestead, Pennsylvania. For days the city and its massive steel mill were taken over by the workers, repelling attacks by a small army of Henry Clay Frick (U.S. Steel) hired Pinkertons and local law enforcement until finally the issue was resolved by what would become the Pennsylvania National Guard. From that seminal moment labor unions would tell the story of the valley and its industries. During World War I and II the valley was affectionately known as the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\" for being the leading single source of American armaments and weaponry. In the 1980s most of the industry of the valley was rocked by the increasing globalization and cheap imports. Although allegations of \\"dumping\\" were well founded in some instances the increasing greed and short-sightedness of labor union leaders and the double speak of industrial leaders lead to a collapse of the valley's industrial might. Famous natives *List of People from Pittsburgh The Steel Valley is renowned for its contribution to world athletics. Many of these sport stars admit that as young men (or women) they had two choices: work in the mine or mill for 10 hours a day or excel at sports enough to win a scholarship and a career. Whatever the reason the valley is known as the \\"Cradle of Quarterbacks\\" as well as the \\"Cradle of Football\\" and the \\"Cradle of Running backs\\", Baseball, and Basketball are also represented well in the area and more recently hockey. Joe Namath, Tony Dorsett, Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Johnny Unitas, Curtis Martin, Ty Law, Kevan Barlow, Jim Kelly, and Mike Ditka all grew up in the actual geographic valley. From baseball the valley claims Ken Griffey, Jr., Ken Griffey, Sr., Stan Musial, Phil Niekro, Joe Niekro, Art Howe, Terry Francona, Honus Wagner, and Curt Leskanic. Basketball greats include John Havlicek, Pete Maravich John Calipari, and Myron Cope.

Biography He was born to a Hasidic Jewish family. After attended a trade school, he worked as a bank clerk. His writing career began in 1930 when he published his short novel Death of the Operator in the current events journal '. He first gained popularity in Poland with his 1930s novels The Unloved and The Rats. He was captured by the Nazis during the invasion of Poland, but managed to escape. After a brief period of service in the Polish Army, he went to Lw√≥w and joined the National Jewish Committee. Around 1942, he returned to Warsaw and was active in the underground. He joined the Home Army in 1944 and took part in the Warsaw Uprising. After the war, he published the novels The Golden Windows and The Merchant of Lodz, and the short story collection Epoch of the Ovens, all concerning the Holocaust and the Jewish resistance. The widely used term \\"epoka piec√≥w\\" (Age of the Stoves) comes from one of his works. After 1953, he began writing essays on a wide range of topics which were ultimately collected in a series of volumes called the Blue Pages. During the 1960s, his works took on a mystical tone. In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture. He spent most of the 1970s in Paris, where he was married and had a son. He returned to Poland, largely forgotten, in the 1980s and lived in Warsaw until his death.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 24th Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania from 1967 to 1971 and as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Early life and career Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Broderick received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1935 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1938. He was assistant counsel to the Rural Electrification Administration (now the Rural Utilities Service) from 1938 to 1941, and was a civilian agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence from 1941 to 1942. During World War II, he was a United States Naval Reserve Lieutenant Commander from 1942 to 1946. While in the Navy, he served on the USS Monrovia in areas such as North Africa, Sicily, Tarawa and Saipan. After the war, he returned to private law practice in Philadelphia. Political career Broderick entered politics as a commissioner to Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania from 1952 to 1954. In 1966, after Walter Alessandroni was killed in a plane crash and posthumously won the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor, party leaders selected Broderick to replace Alessandroni on the ticket with Raymond P. Shafer. The pair defeated the Democratic ticket of Milton Shapp and Leonard Staisey in the 1966 gubernatorial election. During his term, He served as a delegate to Pennsylvania‚Äôs 1967 constitutional convention. In the 1970 gubernatorial election, Broderick ran to succeed Shafer against Shapp. This time Shapp won the governorship with 55% of the vote to Broderick‚Äôs 41%. Broderick‚Äôs campaign ran an ad in the Philadelphia Inquirer portraying Shapp as a leader of stone-throwing protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Shapp responded with ads challenging Broderick‚Äôs credibility on the budget. Governor Shafer proposed a state income tax during his administration to balance the state budget. Broderick broke with his former running mate and promised a balanced budget no income tax, which Shafer seemed was not possible. Federal judicial service Broderick was nominated by President Richard Nixon on March 23, 1971, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, to a new seat authorized by 84 Stat. 294. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 21, 1971, and received his commission on April 23, 1971. He assumed senior status on July 1, 1984. He took inactive senior status on June 5, 2000. His service terminated on August 6, 2000, due to his death. Notable cases One of Brodericks's most significant cases was Halderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital in which he ruled that the abuse of mentally disabled patients violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He ordered the Pennhurst State School and Hospital in Spring City, Pennsylvania closed and all residents returned to their home communities.Anti- Institutionalization and the Supreme Court, 14 Rutgers L.Rev. 595 (1983). The United States Supreme Court vacated the ruling in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman; however the case led to a settlement with the state of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia to provide for community-based care of mentally disabled residents. In the 1979 case, Gilfillan v. City of Philadelphia, Broderick ruled that, under the Establishment Clause, the city of Philadelphia could not use taxpayer funds in constructing a platform for Pope John Paul II to use for a mass on his visit to the city. He ordered the city to seek reimbursement for construction costs from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Death Broderick died of cancer in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania on August 6, 2000.

Studies indicate it can also slow the course of osteoarthritis of the knee.New osteoarthritis treatments on the horizon, from the May 2013 Harvard Women‚Äôs Health Watch The drug is unusual in that it both increases deposition of new bone by osteoblasts and reduces the resorption of bone by osteoclasts. It is therefore promoted as a \\"dual action bone agent\\" (DABA). On 13 May 2013, Servier released a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication which stated that new restrictions for the use of strontium ranelate are now in place, as randomised trials have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Servier states that the use is now restricted to treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture.http://www.imb.ie/EN/Publications/Publications/Protelos-strontium- ranelate-Important-Safety-Information-from-Servier-as-approved-by-the-Irish- Medicines-Board.aspx The European Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommends restriction in the use of strontium ranelate, based on a routine benefit-risk assessment of the medicine, which included data showing an increased risk of heart problems, including heart attacks.http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Medicine_QA/human/000560/WC500142021.pdf On 21 February 2014 the European Medicine Agency recommended that strontium ranelate remain available with restrictions relative to patients with existing heart disease.http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2014/02/news_detail_002031.jsp‚à£=WC0b01ac058004d5c1  Uses  Strontium ranelate is registered as a prescription drug in more than 70 countries for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis to reduce the risk of vertebral and hip fractures. In the United States, strontium ranelate is not approved by the FDA. In the United Kingdom, strontium ranelate is prescribed under the National Health Service as a medicine for the treatment of post menopausal osteoporosis.NHS Choices: Strontium Ranelate 2 major phase III clinical studies, SOTI (Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention) and TROPOS (Treatment of Peripheral Osteoporosis), were started in 2000 to investigate the efficacy of strontium ranelate in reducing vertebral fractures and peripheral fractures, including hip fractures. In the 3 years results, reported in 2004, strontium ranelate showed significant reduction in vertebral fractures with 41% and hip fractures with 36% compared with patients treated with placebo. The efficacy was sustained in 5 years data. The 5 years data confirmed that strontium ranelate can reduce the vertebral fractures significantly no matter the risk factors of the osteoporotic women have. These include their age (<70, 70‚Äì80 and >80), bone mineral density (osteoporotic and osteopenia), prevalent fractures (0 prevalent fracture, 1‚Äì2 prevalent fractures and >2 prevalent fractures), symptomatic fractures, body mass index and smoking. Strontium ranelate shows anti-fracture efficacy in very old elderly and osteopenic patients.  Contraindications  Strontium ranelate is contraindicated in hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. It is not recommended in patients with severe renal disease, i.e. creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min due to lack of data. Precaution is advised in patients at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including patients with a history of VTE. Precaution is advised in patients with phenylketonuria, as formulations of strontium ranelate contain phenylalanine.Protelos ‚Äì European Medicines Agency ‚Äì Europa.eu Precaution as it interferes with colorimetric measurements of calcium in blood and urine.  Side effects  Strontium ranelate increased the risk of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is now restricted. The most common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, headache and eczema, but with only 2‚Äì4% increase compared with placebo group. However, most of those side effects resolved within 3 months. Occasional severe allergic reactions have been reported including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)  Interactions  According to the manufacturer, strontium ranelate should be taken 2 hours apart from food, milk and derivative products, and medicinal products containing calcium. Should be taken 2 hours before antacids. Treatment should be suspended while taking oral tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics, as these chelate the strontium ion.  Pharmacology = Mechanism of action  Strontium, which has the atomic number 38, belongs to group II in the periodic table of elements, just beneath calcium. Because its nucleus is very nearly the same size as that of calcium, the body easily takes up strontium and incorporates it into bones and tooth enamel in place of calcium. This is not a health problem, and in fact, it can provide a health benefit. For example, in clinical trials, the drug strontium ranelate was found to aid bone growth, increase bone density, and lessen vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures in women. Strontium ranelate is an antiosteoporotic agent which both increases bone formation and reduces bone resorption, resulting in a rebalance of bone turnover in favor of bone formation. This is similar to the effects of choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid. Strontium ranelate stimulates the calcium-sensing receptors and leads to the differentiation of pre-osteoblast to osteoblast which increases the bone formation. Strontium ranelate also stimulates osteoblasts to secrete osteoprotegerin in inhibiting osteoclasts formed from pre-osteoclasts in relation to the RANKL system, which leads to the decrease of bone resorption. Research A large international study, the \\"Strontium Ranelate Efficacy in Knee Osteoarthritis trial,\\" or SEKOIA, reported in 2012 that the drug significantly slowed the course of knee OA compared to placebo in a double- blind ransomised controlled trial. The drug reduced knee OA pain symptoms, improved function, and reduced x-ray detectable cartilage loss, as shown by reductions in joint space narrowing over three years.

In addition to Benoordenhout, Haagse Hout consists of the Bezuidenhout, Mariahoeve en Marlot, and Haagse Bos neighbourhoods. Benoordenhout is located northeast of the city centre and is enclosed by the Koningskade, Raamweg, the Hubertuspark, the barracks and dunes north of the Waalsdorperweg, the city's border with Wassenaar, the Haagse Bos (The Hague Woods) and Malieveld. The neighbourhood gets its name from the Haagse Bos. In Dutch, 'Benoorden' means 'situated north of' and 'hout' is an archaic term for forest. In modern Dutch, 'hout' solely refers to the material wood. Benoordenhout is in turn divided into seven areas: the Nassaubuurt, Uilennest, Duinzigt, Waalsdorp, Arendsdorp, Clingendael and the area around the Van Hoytemastraat. History The Benoordenhout was built almost completely during the twentieth century. Few buildings existed before 1900, the most notable being the buildings in Clingendael and Arendsdorp. As can be seen on historical maps http://www.haagsebeeldbank.nl/afbeelding/31af838a-5c2d-4ea8-82ac-89ffbde01104 only the area between Koningskade and Jan van Nassaustraat, in today's Nassaubuurt, had residential buildings. By 1920, some buildings had been added, including the Shell headquarters at the Carel van Bylandtlaan. Between 1920 and 1940, houses were built up to the Alkemadelaan and the Waalsdorperweg, and in Duinzigt even beyond the Alkemadelaan. With the German invasion in 1940, construction stopped; only a few buildings were added, most notably the Julianakazerne barracks. Unlike in the Bezuidenhout, the damage resulting from the war was limited. Uilennest was completed after the war. The sixties and seventies saw the construction of the eastern part of Duinzigt, the Bronovo hospital, the Nebo nursing home, and the ANWB headquarters.https://bagviewer.kadaster.nl/lvbag/bag- viewer/index.html#?geometry.x=82058.486875&geometry.y;=457523.819375&zoomlevel;=11 The zoo, which had been closed since 1943, made way for the building of the provincial administration in 1968.http://historie.hdpnet.nl/dtuin.htm Gallery Sint-Paschalis Baylonkerk Den Haag 1.JPGChurch of Saint Paschal Baylon (1919-1921), designed by Dutch traditionalist architect Alexander Kropholler Shell kantoor Den Haag.JPGGlobal headquarters of Royal Dutch Shell at Carel van Bylandtlaan (1928-1930) Duinwyck - Van Alkemadelaan 350, The Hague.JPGDuinwyck, an apartment building at Van Alkemadelaan (1929-1932) Villa Hartog - Van Soutelandelaan 141, The Hague 1.JPGHartog House at Van Soutelandelaan (1937-1938) Bylandtv2.jpgFormer farmhouse, constructed around the year 1700, at the Arendsdorp estate, now embedded within the city fabric Arendsdorp - Tuinhuis v2.jpgFormer garden/tea house of Arendsdorp estate, constructed in approximately 1750 Den Haag - Wassenaarseweg 44.JPGFormer gatekeepers house, constructed around the year 1700, at the Oostduin estate, now giving access to a public park International Criminal Court building (2016) in The Hague.pngSeat of the International Criminal Court, on the edge of Benoordenhout at the dunes of Scheveningen Overzicht middenstuk voorgevel - 's-Gravenhage - 20357888 - RCE.jpgOffice building at Wassenaarseweg, constructed 1938-1942 and completed 1946, designed by Jacobus Oud Gebouw Cultura, Wassenaarseweg 20, Den Haag.jpgCultura building at Wassenaarseweg (1920-1921) Denhaag monument koningin-moeder emma2.jpgQueen Emma memorial (1935) at the ‚ÄúRosarium‚Äù or Rose garden Kantoor Centrale Onderlinge - Van Alkemadelaan 700, The Hague.JPGOffice building at Van Alkemadelaan (1933-1935 and 1949-1950), designed by Jan Wils Den Haag - Jan van Nassaustraat 35.JPGGentleman residence at Jan van Nassaustraat (1899) designed in eclectic architecture Overzicht van de westgevel - 's-Gravenhage - 20419387 - RCE.jpgAmerican Protestant Church, originally exhibited at the Brussels World's Fair of 1958, deconstructed in 1962 and reconstructed in The Hague See also *Neuhuyskade ReferencesExternal links * Category:Neighbourhoods of The Hague ","title":"Benoordenhout"},{"id":"10053244","text":"Suzlon One Earth, designed by Benninger, in Pune, Maharashtra Christopher Charles Benninger is an American-Indian architect and planner.

Funding and challenges The yearly budget of NPR 27 Crore (about US$ 2.371 million), two thirds of which is funded by the government. Nepalnews.com Mercantile Communications Pvt. Ltd The hospital has been facing financial difficulties for many years now. The lack of adequate funding, non-functional equipment and inability of the administration to get those running pose significant challenges to the hospital's functioning. Moreover, inappropriate politicization of the administration seems to be the major contributor to the sorry state of affairs at the hospital. To help in the financing of the hospital expenses, it runs a medical school, which conducts post-graduate medical, surgical and other specialists training and also runs bachelor's level in nursing.Bir Hospital Appeal See also *List of hospitals in Nepal *Journal of Nepal Medical Association References Category:Hospitals in Nepal Category:Hospitals established in 1889 Category:Buildings and structures in Kathmandu ","title":"Bir Hospital"},{"id":"10053288","text":"Ernest P. \\"Ernie\\" Kline (June 20, 1929 ‚Äì May 13, 2009) was a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate and the 25th Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1971-1979.

In 2006, CBSPs bank Cr√©dit Lyonnais were sued by a group of Americans who claimed that the bank knowingly allowed money to be funneled to Hamas via its accounts. In 2007, the Israel-friendly Simon Wiesenthal Center accused CBSP of funding families of suicide bombers and the CBSP countered with a defamation suit.

Credit Lyonnais= In 2006, thirteen Americans led by Moses Strauss who had sustained injuries from terrorist attacks in Israel, filed a lawsuit in a District Court in Brooklyn against the French-based bank Cr√©dit Lyonnais under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992. They claimed that the bank knowingly allowed funds to be funnelled to Hamas by failing to quickly close bank accounts for the CBSP.

In response, the CBSP filed a defamation suit in a Paris court, calling the accusations \\"ridiculous\\", and stating that its charitable work consisted of providing aid to some 3,000 Palestinian orphans.Nazi-hunting centre convicted for defamation . Agence France Presse. (March 8, 2007). Accessed 12 March 2007. On March 8, 2007, the court ruled that documents produced by the Wiesenthal Center established no \\"direct or indirect participation in financing terrorism\\" on the part of the CBSP, characterizing the allegations as \\"seriously defamatory.\\" Samuel was handed a suspended fine of 1,000 euros (1,300 dollars) and ordered to pay one euro in symbolic damages to the Palestinian support group The Center appealed the court ruling, and won its case on appeal before the Paris Court of Appeal in October 2008. The court ruled that there was nothing defamatory in the Centre's allegations against the CBSP.LE CBSP PERD SON PROCES EN APPEL : defaite judiciaire pour les amis du Hamas en France =CRIF case= In 2010 Marc Knobel, a researcher of the Jewish-French umbrella organization Conseil Repr√©sentatif des Institutions juives de France (CRIF) published an article on the organization's web site claiming that the CBSP was raising money for Hamas. CBSP responded by suing Knobel for defamation. In 2012, a lower court whose ruling was appealed fined Knobel and CRIF's webmaster $2,070 each for defaming CBSP. In 2014 an appeals court reaffirmed the ruling by the lower court. The courts ruled that Knobel's article was defamatory because CRIF had failed to present evidence supporting its allegation that CBSP funded Hamas.
