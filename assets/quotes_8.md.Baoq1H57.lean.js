Its route mainly followed the Romanche valley from its birth to its confluence with the Drac.  Situation and importance  Topographically, the Romanche basin (a tributary of the Is√®re river) is a particularly deep valley. Situated between Grenoble and Italy, it is one of the few roads between the Mediterranean and Switzerland that allow traffic to flow towards Italy. Anticipating a landing of the allies in Provence, the German army considered withdrawal through Italy; it was thus necessary to maintain these communication and transport routes open and under control. In addition to an access road, it was essential for the Germans to ensure the transportation of aluminum and magnesium stocks from the \\"Lower Romansh\\" plants to Germany. The Oisans maquis and its roads became, in two ways, strategic for German troops from the beginning of the occupation of the Southern Zone. Moreover, \\"Sector 1\\" (Oisans) had a special position in the region since, from November 1943 onwards, the Resistance within the city of Grenoble was directly under the command of the Oisans. This maquis is therefore the only one in the historic region of the Dauphin√© (and perhaps in France) to have coordinated both its activities in the mountains (on wild summits over 3,000m high) and the city Resistance of the \\"capital of the Alps\\" in the plains.  Start  On 22 June 1940, the French government signed the armistice. Certain officers or military cadres continued fighting, forming troops and Resistance groups. This was the case of Lieutenant Andr√© Lespiau: after having been ordered to the 9th Colonial Towed Artillery Regiment (9e r√©giment d‚Äôartillerie coloniale tract√©e) for his conduct at fire in June 1940, he joined the head office of the Colonial Troops in Fr√©jus, then joined the Arm√©e Secr√®te in the Var. There, he was christened \\"Lanvin\\". He would later become famous as \\"captain\\" of the troop of about 1,500 men of the main Oisans maquis. From the end of November 1942, the ranks of the maquis swelled after the introduction of the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO), which encouraged many young people to \\"go underground\\" and hide in the mountains so as not to be forced to work in Germany. Captain Andr√© Lespiau was assigned to the Groupements Militaires d'Indig√®nes Coloniaux Rapatriables (GMICR) in Fr√©jus. With the appearance of important Resistance maquis in the Alps (Savoie/Haute- Savoie, Is√®re, Ain, Dr√¥me, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes de Haute-Provence), he was then appointed, in February 1943, to command the 14th Company of the 1st Sub-Group of the 1st GMICR in Jarrie in Is√®re - neighbour of the 13th Company, in Pont- de-Claix. It was truly from this moment that the various Alpine maquis \\"officially\\" took shape, under the command of General Delestraint (alias \\"Vidal\\") and then Officer Alain Le Ray (FFI). Thus, in Oisans, different groups united under the command of Lanvin, to control this area (called \\"Sector 1\\") from the Grenoble metropolis to the gates of Savoy in the east and as far as Lavaldens in the south. Another maquis was responsible for the southern part of the Oisans region (called \\"Sector 5\\"), which overflowed into the Tri√®ves (Notre-Dame-de-Commiers, Monestier-de-Clermont, La Mure, Valbonnais).  Organisation  Thanks to a leader who was a professional soldier, the Oisans maquis had a quasi-military organisation. Its 1,526 men and women were divided into five \\"action\\" sections of 150 men each; the rest of the group was in charge of various tasks such as supply, intelligence, surveillance, maintenance, etc.  1943  On December 20, at the Alma barracks in Grenoble, Captain Lespiau (\\"Lanvin\\") was given command of \\"Sector 1\\" of the Secret Army by Commander Sylvain, who had led the Grenoble Resistance until then. At the end of November 1943, the Gestapo and the Milice had dealt a coup de gr√¢ce to the Grenoble organisation by capturing its leaders. Three months later, Andr√© Lespiau was declared a \\"deserter\\" by his army officers. His father, Captain Paul Lespiau (decorated veteran of the First World War and member of the network) was arrested in reprisal and deported to Buchenwald, where he died. Captain \\"Lanvin-Lespiau\\" was now completely underground. But the Maquis de l'Oisans also had at its service men and women of many different nationalities and origins. Their leader, \\"Lanvin\\", was of Catalan origin and served in the colonial troops with Indochinese and African riflemen under his command. Among his recruits were Poles, Russians, Tunisians, Algerians, Spaniards, and others. \\"Oisans\\" also had a Catholic chaplain and a rabbi in its ranks.  1944 = F.F.I. hospital  FFI hospital in Alpes d'Huez, summer 1944 In addition to its activities against the German and Militia forces, the Oisans maquis was responsible for the F.F.I. hospital for the entire Is√®re area. In 1944 there was a small chalet (\\"Le Chalet du Signal\\") which was made available to the F.F.I. in early July by its owner. A surgical block was installed there by Captain Robert Tissot, a doctor and soldier, for the wounded of the maquis; this chief-doctor brought himself his 10kg of surgical equipment. At the beginning of August, after the maquis defeats of the Vercors and Gli√®res (Savoy), the German 157th Division attempted to encircle the Oisans in order to put an end to the maquis and free an essential road towards Italy. This manoeuvre forced the hospital and its patients to flee higher up, erasing all trace of their passage in the chalet and the village of Alpe d'Huez, while the para-military groups organised the counter-attack. Two groups were evacuated: on the one hand, the most able- bodied patients and some of the medical staff were hidden in the forests; on the other, the seriously wounded (including two amputees) left with the rest of the medical staff on 11 August at 11 am. Inhabitants made a hedge of honour to this fleeing column. The maquisards were assisted in this evacuation by 11 American soldiers, crew of a \\"B-24 Liberator\\" which had crashed a few days earlier in the Hautes-Alpes and who had been taken by the maquis to this \\"field hospital\\" (their pilot being wounded). Their presence will be used to carry stretchers, transport equipment, carry out reconnaissance missions and hide food and bandages. On the evening of 11 August 1944, the most seriously- wounded soldiers of the F.F.I. settled with their caretakers at l'Alpette, a few kilometres and 300 metres from the La Fare refuge (in Vaujany). The barns were used as treatment and restrooms. But on the 14th, while still dark, the makeshift hospital had to leave the premises because the German troops were getting dangerously close. The refuge is 300 m higher and it was impossible to transport the wounded on stretchers as the terrain is so steep. The amputees were hidden in rocks at the bottom of this promontory, each one with his or her own caregiver. During the night of August 14 to 15, the F.F.I. fighters of \\"Mobile Group No. 4\\" arrived, under the command of Lieutenant Menton. They took up positions to the north and east of the Alpette, so that they blocked the Germans' advance on their comrades. The battle lasted five to six hours and resulted in about 20 deaths on the German side and no casualties on the French side. The \\"battle of Grandes Rousses\\" will remain as one of the rare victorious direct confrontations against the German army for the maquis, more accustomed to ambushes and isolated actions than to a face-to-face battlefield. But, despite this victory, the pursuit by the Bavarian Alpine Hunters is not over and what remains of the German company is determined to capture or kill the hospital team. On the morning of 15 August, the Germans spotted the wounded and the hospital staff at the La Fare hut; the group then set off again towards Lac La Fare, where they found a hut full of maquisards who had come from the north after fighting at the Glandon Pass. With German troops having occupied the Romanche valley for 4 days now, there is only one way out for the patients and their companions: to go up towards the east. Without equipment and weapons, they hid for several days in a wall on the edge of the glacier, eating \\"Brun\\" (fr) biscuits and capturing a sheep that they devoured almost raw. For a few days, the Rajon shelter at Lac La Fare had become the highest hospital in the world, at an altitude of 2,645 metres.  Epilogue  On 22 August 1944 at 5am, the Germans having fled the city during the night, the \\"Groupe Franc d'Uriage\\" was the very first unit of armed men to enter a liberated Grenoble, a few hours before the Americans. Exceptional fact in Europe: in the South-Is√®re region, the Germans had to surrender to the local Resistance (the \\"terrorists\\"), not to the Free French military, nor to the allied American and British forces. On the same day, the mobile groups of the Oisans maquis joined up with the 1st battalion of the 143rd American infantry regiment in Vizille. A short and intense battle took hundreds of German prisoners at the ch√¢teau de Vizille. At the end of August 1944, the Oisans and Grenoble regained their freedom, but the war was not over. Numerous maquisards from the Oisans continued their commitment, notably by forming the 1st Colonial Infantry Battalion (1st B.I.C.) and the Colonial Artillery Group (1er G.A.C.) which distinguished themselves in the Maurienne fights. At the end of 1944, the 1st B.I.C. became the 11th Battalion of \\"Oisans\\" Alpine Hunters (11th B.C.A.) and the 1st G.A.C. became the 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment (93e R.A.M.). Both of them covered themselves with glory at the Mont Froid battle (in Dr√¥me). The 93rd R.A.M. keeps a faithful memory of it. Other maquisards from the Oisans chose to join and fight in the troops of the 1st French army led by General de Lattre de Tassigny.  Official recognition  In spite of its central role in the liberation of Grenoble and the Is√®re d√©partement, the Oisans maquis has little national and international renown, compared to the Vercors or the Savoie maquis, for example. The memory concerning it rarely goes beyond the communal or departmental scale. Place du maquis de l'Oisans, in S√©chilienne A monument to the dead of the Oisans maquis was built at Livet-et-Gavet, the M√©morial de l'Infernet. A memorial plaque has been placed at the La Fare lake (Vaujany commune) with the following text: Dans ce modeste refuge et alentour s√©journa au cours de l‚Äô√©t√© 1944, l‚ÄôH√¥pital D√©partemental des Forces Fran√ßaises de l‚ÄôInt√©rieur qui, sous la direction de son m√©decin chef le docteur Robert TISSOT couvert par un groupe de protection maquisard, aid√© par 11 hommes d‚Äôun √©quipage de l‚ÄôU.S. Air Force, d√ª se replier sous la pression des Alpenjager de la 157√®me Division Alpine Bavaroise.

As a scribe of later Middle English literature, he is particularly known for works by John Lydgate and Geoffrey Chaucer.  Biography  Shirley's career began in the service of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. In 1403, Shirley was in Warwick's retinue in the campaign against Owain Glyn D≈µr. In 1414, he collected wages for Warwick's retinue in France and was specified as the earl's secretary in 1420‚Äì21. Warwick returned to England between 1428 and 1430 as tutor to Henry VI, from whom Shirley received a new year's gift in 1428. In June 1428, Shirley and other members of the Beauchamp household were admitted to confraternity of St Albans Abbey. In 1432-3, Shirley was Comptroller of Petty Customs in the Port of London, and in 1436 he was recorded as having an income of ¬£10 from lands in Hertfordshire. Between about 1438 and his death Shirley rented four shops from St Bartholomew's Hospital. On the basis of manuscripts copied for Shirley, in his hand, or associated with him, some have speculated that Shirley ran a scriptorium or library from these properties. Shirley both translated works from French and Latin and collected and annotated copies of contemporary vernacular authors, such as Chaucer and Lydgate. In Shirley's will, he asked to be buried in the lady chapel at St Bartholomew's Hospital, near his mother and first wife, Elizabeth. His second wife, Margaret, survived him. Shirley died on 21 October 1456 and was buried at St Bartholomew's. His epitaph was recorded by the Elizabethan antiquary John Stow, who owned several manuscripts copied by or associated with Shirley.  Manuscripts  The surviving manuscripts associated with Shirley can be categorized into three groups: those in Shirley's own hand, those that he annotated, and those apparently derived from manuscripts probably owned or annotated by him.

History  Synthesis, properties, and reactivity of the compound were first described in 2006 by Antonio Togni and his coworkers at ETH Zurich. The article also contains information on 1,3-Dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-1-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2-benziodoxole (Togni Reagent I).  Preparation  The synthesis consists of three steps. In the first step, 2-Iodobenzoic acid is oxidized by sodium periodate and cyclized to 1-Hydroxy-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one. The target compound can be obtained by acylation with acetic anhydride and subsequent substitution reaction with trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane. Synthese Alternatively, trichloroisocyanuric acid can be used as oxidant in the place of sodium periodate for a newer one- pot synthesis method.  Properties = Physical Properties  The compound crystallized in a monoclinic crystal structure. The space group is P21/n with four molecules in the unit cell.

Heating it above the melting point will lead to strong exothermic decomposition, in which trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is released. The heat of composition at a temperature of 149 ¬∞C and higher has been determined to be 502 J¬∑g‚àí1.From recrystallization in acetonitrile, small amounts of trifluoromethyl-2-iodobenzoate and 2-iodobenzyl fluoride were observed as decomposition products. 1-Trifluoromethyl-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one reacts violently with strong bases and acids, as well as reductants. In tetrahydrofuran, the compound polymerizes.  Uses  The compound is used for trifluoromethylation of organic compounds. For phenolates, the substitution takes place preferably in the ortho position.

It presently functions as a prison. Built between 1879 and 1886 it was intended as one of a number of forts, known as the Campo Entrincheirado of Lisbon, that formed a defensive perimeter that followed the boundaries of Lisbon at the time. It consisted of two separate strongholds, the north and the south. Originally called the Fort of Caxias, it was renamed as the Fort of King Lu√≠s I in 1901 in honour of the king who died in 1889. The fort was first used as a prison in 1916 when a group of soldiers who mutinied were arrested. In 1917 it was used to house construction workers who had gone on strike and in the same year telegraph workers on strike were also held there. From 1935 the southern part of the fort was used by the Estado Novo dictatorship as a political prison, which included torture chambers, and this continued until Portugal‚Äôs Carnation Revolution, when its doors were opened on April 25, 1974. It was subsequently used briefly to detain right-wing politicians. The fort was transferred to Portugal‚Äôs Prison Service in December 1988. Although the fort was not generally used by the Estado Novo to accommodate the communist party‚Äôs top leaders, who were mainly held in the Peniche Fortress, it did witness a mass escape on 4 December 1961 when eight communist party members were able to escape in an armoured car, which they succeeded in smashing through the main gate. The driver had taken a long time gaining the confidence of the guards by convincing them that he had rejected communism and was now on their side.

His younger brother was William Hay, who served as the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1817 to 1819. His paternal grandparents were William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock and Lady Anne Livingston (a daughter of James Livingston, 5th Earl of Linlithgow). Career In 1778, he succeeded to the earldom of Erroll following the death of his father. In 1780, he entered the British Army as Cornet, 7th Dragoons. He was made Captain of the 5th Dragoons in 1786 and of the 58th Regiment of Foot in 1792. In 1793, he became a Major of the 78th Regiment of Foot and a Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Foot in 1795. From 1796 until his death in 1798, he was a Representative Peer for Scotland. Right to title Upon the death of his father's aunt, Mary Hay, 14th Countess of Erroll (who died in 1758 without issue), his father James became the 15th Earl of Arroll. Mary's sister Margaret had previously died at Rome in 1723, however she had married James Livingston, 5th Earl of Linlithgow, 4th Earl of Callendar. This regrant was questioned in the House of Lords in 1797. The then Earl of Lauderdale had questioned George, the 16th Earl of Erroll's right to vote at an election of the peers of Scotland. One of the objections made to the title was that the title of Earl of Erroll was claimed through a nomination. It was decided in 1748 in the case of the earldom of Stair that this power of nomination could not be validly exercised after the Union. The House of Lords, after a full inquiry, decided in favour of the 16th Earl of Erroll's right to the title. That the Earl of Erroll holds the honours of his house undoubtedly and without dispute, is clear from the decision of the House of Lords.Notes and Queries; p. 13; By Inc Chadwyck-Healey, William White; Published by Oxford University Press, 1852; link  Personal life On 25 January 1790, Lord Erroll was married to Elizabeth Jemima Blake (d. 1831), the sister of Joseph Blake, 1st Baron Wallscourt and a daughter of Joseph Blake of Ardfry (County Galway, Ireland) and Honoria Daly (a daughter of Dermot Daly). Her sister, Joanna Harriet Blake, was the mother of Sir Dominick Daly, the 15th Governor of Prince Edward Island and 7th Governor of South Australia. Lord Erroll died on 14 June 1798 and was succeeded by his younger brother, William. His widow, the dowager Countess of Erroll, remarried to the Rt.-Hon. John Hookham Frere (a son of John Frere) on 12 September 1816, before her death in 1831.

The programme offers animation's videos concerning news on a fun way, and condensed with a didactic aim. Each episode try to reveal and figure out the mechanisms of society and their unknown aspects. The DataGueule's team is made up of Henri Poulain (creator and producer), Julien Goetz (co-author and co-creator) and of Sylvain Lapoix (investigator and co-author). Description=Composition of the episodes Until the fourth season, the episodes were short, on average between 3 and 5 minutes, condensing the numerals, realities and future ideas quickly. During the fifth season, the episodes are dividing in three parts : the first explaining the situation and setting numerals out quickly in few minutes, before a phase of interview of a specialist in this subject, who explains more in detail the problem and the possibilities, that are picked again in the last part. The images and texts are arranged in mosaic, depicting an image in the fourth first seasons, and an emblematic statue of our society in the fifth. Authors Julien Goetz works at the beginning of the 2000's for the very one multimedia editorial board of Radio France as a freelance web developer during six or seven years. Then, he joins the OWNI company (acronym of \\"Objet web non identifi√©\\", in English : \\"Unidentified Web object\\") during two years to make data journalism in 2011. In 2011, he takes part in other projects like Nuit sujet (in English : \\"Night subject\\") with Radio Nova where debates are approached. From September 2012 to June 2013, he is co-author in C Politique on France 5. In May and June 2014, he contacts France 4 for the creation of the DataGueule's channel. He is also actor from time to time and is often employed to make voice-over. He co-writes with Jean-Marc Manach a report for Arte, titled Une contre-histoire de l'Internet (in English : \\"a counter-history of the Internet\\"). From November 2013 to March 2014, he works with Premi√®res Lignes T√©l√©vision and Journalism++ on Jeu d'influence (in English : \\"Influence game\\"), a concept mixing game and documentary talking about the crisis' questions. In 2015, he works to the writing of a documentary of 90 min. It is in June 6th 2014 that the channel DataGueule appear for the first time on the Web, with a video about Ukraine. Their research work begins in May 6th 2014. The principle of this programme is to \\"deconstruct several mechanisms, with humor and if possible an historical prism (...) subjects about which we realize that it doesn't run smoothly. Even if we must dissect them to understand exactly what doesn't run smoothly\\". This programme isn't the one who create the genre, an Australian first concept existed yet, named Hungry Beast, but owing to numerals and datas used as well as the informal tone that France 4 allows, the tone of the DataGueule team's videos appears more striking, quicklier and more scathing. \\"What is my first interest in datas, it's the assessment that it enable to make. The basic premise it's : how had we come to this situation, until the normalization of these facts without researching if it is good or bad. We're always having an informal tone. And we're trying no to go into clich√©s, given that it's a short programme\\". Subjects The subjects are defined by the team of Julien Goetz. \\"It is not France 4 which impose the thematics\\", declare him in an interview. Broadcasting Several parts of DataGueule are broadcast in L'Autre JT on France 4, but mainly on the Web via YouTube, Dailymotion and PeerTube for the broadcasting, and also on other means of communication. Since June 23rd 2015, the channel is also broadcast on the IRL platform of FranceTV : IRL, les nouvelles √©critures du r√©el (in English : \\"IRL, the new writings of the real\\"). The programme was very briefly broadcast on the TV channel France Info at the air opening of this latter, in September 2016. It is not anymore the case today. Since December 2018, the programme is also broadcast on the Imago TV's programme. Seasons At the beginning, the programme had signed a contract of ten episodes, then, given the growing success of the channel, fifteen other episodes were added to the contract for a total of twenty-five episodes at least. In June 2020, the programme reaches five seasons and 97 episodes. Audience The programme meets with success since the first broadcasts, which provokes the surprise of Julien Goetz. Several episodes had reached with ease 100 000 views and others, like the video about the sleep, had exceeded the 1 100 000 views in 2020. In May 2020, the YouTube channel of the programme has more than 540 000 followers and more than 40 millions of views by cumulative audience.

A German- speaking member of the nobility of Schleswig-Holstein, he played an important role in a period when the rise of nationalism started to create conflicts between the German-speaking minority ruling classes and the Danish-speaking lower-classes of Schleswig. Early life Schow was born and raised in Rendsburg in Schleswig. His father, J√∏rgen von Schouw, was oberst in the Danish military, serving most of his career in the duchies. Schow studied law at the university in Kiel and graduated in May of 1797. He moved to Copenhagen to work an unpaid internship in Rentekammeret in 1800, and with unusual speed, got a position in the German Chancellery (Danish: Tyske Kancelli) in 1802. While in Copenhagen, he befriended Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, later to be an important figure in the German nationalist movement to make the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein independent German states, independent of Denmark.https://www.dengang.dk/artikler/3707 Mayor of Aabenraa In 1805, the 27-year-old Schow was appointed by the king as new mayor and official secretary of Aabenraa. That same year, perhaps due to his new appointment, he married Georgine Johanne Christiane Sophie Callisen (1782‚Äì1849), daughter of the general superintendent in Holstein, Johann Leonhard Callisen.https://www.dengang.dk/artikler/3707 As mayor, he answered to Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, the royal governor of Schleswig-Holstein. Schow showed himself to be a strong leader in the English wars, ensuring that Aabenraa had a local militia and a detachment of Danish troops, as well as helping to finance an armed ship in the harbour, a gunboat named after Princess Caroline of Denmark.https://www.dengang.dk/artikler/2080Japsen, G.: Den nationale udvikling i √Öbenr√• 1800-1850 (The National Development in √Öbenr√•), Aabenraa 1961 As the waves of nationalism fanned Europe, Schow found himself allied to the German liberal cause, advocating for a Constitution of the Estates for both duchies.

In 1837, Schow‚Äôs health began to fail, and his son who had been assisting him through illness, Georg Heinrich Leonhard Schow (1810-89), was named mayor in his place. Schow died two years later.

Biography=Early life and career Lecointe was the son of Jacques-Pierre Lecointe, a major of infantry. He entered the French military academy at Saint-Cyr in 1837 and successively was promoted to sous-lieutenant (second lieutenant) of infantry in 1839, lieutenant in 1842, capitaine (captain) in 1848, and major in 1854. Crimean War Lecointe took part in the Crimean War (1854‚Äì1856) as a battalion commander attached to the army of G√©n√©ral de division Pierre Bosquet and participated in the Battle of the Alma on 20 September 1854 and the Battle of Malakoff on 8 September 1855. In 1857 he took part in part in the Algeria in the Campaign of Kabylie in Algeria during the pacification of Algeria and seized Borj Mawlay Hasan (known to the French as Fort l'Empereur). Second Italian War of Independence Lecointe returned to France in 1859 at the time of the Second Italian War of Independence. His division, the well-proven grenadier division of the Imperial Guard Corps, which belonged to the III Corps under the command of General Patrice de MacMahon, contributed to the French success in the Battle of Magenta on 4 June 1859 by clearing Buffalora. Wounded the same day, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 18 June 1859. He was stationed with the garrison of Paris after the war and was promoted to colonel in 1864. Franco-Prussian War In 1866, Lecointe took command of the 2nd Grenadier Regiment of the Imperial Guard Corps. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, he led the regiment as part of the Army of the Rhine. He was wounded during the Battle of Mars-la-Tour on 16 August 1870 and was surrounded in Metz with the rest of the Army of the Rhine on 19 August 1870, beginning the 70-day Siege of Metz. When Metz capitulated in October 1870, Lecointe escaped and joined the Army of the North, led first by G√©n√©ral de division Charles-Denis Bourbaki and then provisionally by G√©n√©ral de brigade Jean-Joseph Farre. On 14 November 1870, he was given command of a brigade of the 22nd Corps. After the defeat of the Army of the North in the Battle of Amiens on 27 November 1870, its retirement from Amiens, and the appointment of G√©n√©ral de division Louis Faidherbe as its new commander, Lecointe took part under Faidherbe in the Battle of Hallue on 23‚Äì24 December 1870, the Battle of Bapaume on 3 January 1871, and the Battle of St. Quentin on 19 January 1871. German forces having cut off all communications between the Army of the North and the rest of France, the 22nd Corps, which still had 18,000 men and 60 guns, received orders to embark at Dunkirk to rally at Cherbourg for operations in Normandy. Later military career Promoted to major general on 16 September 1871, Lecointe was paced in reserve. He was recalled to active duty in 1873 as commander of the 1st Division of I Corps in Lille. He took command of the 17th Corps in Toulouse in 1878, then of the 14th Corps at Lyon in 1879. In January 1880, he became military governor of Lyon. When General Justin Clinchant died in 1881, Lecointe replaced him as military governor of Paris in 1882, holding the position until 1884. Political career After Jean-Louis Lepouz√© died soon after his election as senator of Eure was invalidated, Lecointe was elected to the French Senate to replace him on 26 February 1882. He sympathized with the political left, supported the republican ministries, and was re-elected on 6 January 1885. He continued to support the left and vote with the republicans the senate, but abstained from voting on the expulsion of princes. Finally, he spoke out for the reinstatement of the district ballot, for the Lisbon bill restricting press freedom, and for the procedure to be followed before the Senate against General Georges Ernest Boulanger. He served as a senator until his death. As a reward for his combat service, Lecointe was kept on active duty, without age limit, when he reached the French Army's mandatory retirement age of 65 in 1882.

Crimes  At present, Murillo Moreno has been convicted solely for the murder of physiotherapist Stephanie Andrea Ram√≠rez Narv√°ez, which occurred in her Cali apartment on June 4, 2017. After failing to attend a meet-up with a patient, her body was found wrapped up in a mattress cover, in the recreational area of a residential complex.

Finally, Colombian authorities have also accused him of perpetrating another two killings in Bogot√°.  Sex crimes  In addition to the murders, Murillo Moreno also committed several sexual assaults. In his criminal record, there are several convictions for sexual abuse, including one committed against a minor. He is believed to have committed one of the attacks in 2007, after being reported for raping a child. At that time, he was detained in Bogot√° by the Attorney General's Office and charged, but acquitted and released the following year.

History The castle was built around 1000 for a member of the high nobility. However, the castle does not appear in any surviving documents and was probably abandoned within a century. Everything that is known about the castle therefore comes from archeological excavations. At the time of its construction, the site was on the border between the Kingdom of Germany and the Kingdom of Arles/Burgundy. The castle was probably built by a member of the high nobility to expand their power in this border region. From the castle they probably ruled over the villages of F√ºllinsdorf, Frenkendorf and the abandoned village of Munzach. A fire around 1050 destroyed part of the castle after which it was rebuilt. By the 12th century the noble family had moved to Neu-Schauenburg Castle and were known as the Lords of Schauenburg. Many of the wooden buildings and fixtures were stripped out of Altenberg and probably moved to Neu-Schauenburg. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ruins were still visible and were also known as Filisberg. This name may have the same origin as the name of the village, F√ºllinsdorf. By the 20th century the ruins were overgrown and covered by soil with only a few traces of walls still visible. An excavation in 1982 identified the massive tower and in 1986/87 the entire site was excavated and repaired. The excavation discovered over 250 items including a piece of gold and silver jewellery. A number of bones were also discovered including herring bones, a very rare find in land locked Switzerland. Castle site In the center of the site is a large tower house which covers about and has thick walls. North-west of the tower is a long section of the curtain wall. A double garderobe or bathroom is built into the curtain wall. On the north end of the complex was a residential tract with a kitchen. The gatehouse was in the southern corner of the castle.

History of DES Diethylstilbestrol molecule ball DES is a synthetic estrogen, which was, from about 1940, prescribed to women at risk of miscarriage and, later, to promote healthy babies. Medical research has now shown that DES has adverse effects and that the approximately 10 million DES-exposed people are at risk for cancer, infertility, pregnancy complications, and other health problems. The drug came onto the United States market in 1940 from several manufacturers, since the drug was both unpatented and cheap to produce. Despite research demonstrating possible carcinogenic effects (documented in the 1930s) and its inefficacy for preventing miscarriage in 1953, pharmaceutical companies publicized earlier and more favorable studies in their marketing and promotion. In 1971, medical researchers identified several clusters of rare vaginal cancers in some of the children exposed to DES in utero, now teenagers and young adults. The news was alarming to many of the women who had taken the drug during their pregnancies. Early DES advocacy As the women's health movement was developing during the same years, concerned women around the country used the model of local organizing and outreach to find other DES- exposed women and their children (known as DES mothers, sons, and daughters). One of the earliest gatherings was of the DES Information Group, founded by Pat Cody (1923-2010) in 1974, working with the Berkeley Free Clinic in California. Cody's group soon joined with the DES Action Committee of the San Francisco-based Committee for the Medical Rights of Women, and the two groups merged into a Bay-area organization. Similar grassroots organizations were being started in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. In February 1978, U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), Joseph Califano, convened the National DES Task Force. It was charged with making recommendations for research and continuing treatment for persons exposed to DES. The task force issued a physician advisory in November 1978 recommending doctors review their records and notify patients who were prescribed DES. Founding DES Action National (later renamed DES Action USA) formed in 1977 with a meeting of these grassroots groups. The organization incorporated as a non-profit in 1979. Much of DES Action USA's early work was at local and state levels. Public health grants and legislative efforts supported educational outreach and medical care in California and New York. DES Action USA also successfully lobbied that a Federal Task Force be established. During the 1980s, work at state and national levels resulted in several official National DES Awareness Weeks (1983-1985), continued educational work and outreach efforts, and support for liability litigation cases against manufacturers. Advocacy and legislation Aware of the need for national funding for DES research and education, director Nora Cody (daughter of Pat Cody) worked closely with Representative Louise M. Slaughter (D-NY) to draft and support a research bill during the early 1990s. The bill was signed into law in 1992, with a second bill passed in 1998 to support research on the third generation of DES-affected people (the grandchildren of DES mothers). Through the early 2000s, their most high- profile work involved working with the Centers for Disease Control to develop and distribute consumer and health professional medical education materials to communicate the latest research about continuing effects of DES exposure. In 2014, DES Action USA, facing the aging of its leadership, chose to merge with another medical nonprofit, the MedShadow Foundation, which does similar educational and outreach work but focuses on the risks and long-term adverse effects of many prescription drugs. The decision allowed the DES Action USA Board to step down from administration, while allowing DES Action USA to continue its work and mission.

It is the umbrella organisation of over 100 Irish civic society organisations.  Core activities  INAR's work includes organising campaigns and projects, developing policies and training, and conducting research. It is a member of the European Network Against Racism. In March 2020, INAR published a report which outlined a large increase in the frequency of racist hate speech in Ireland in the preceding two years, from 140 incidents in 2018 to 530 in 2019. They called on the Irish government to develop a National Action Plan Against Racism to combat this. Alongside a number of other organisations they called for the introduction of hate crime legislation as recommended by the UN in 2019. One of their projects was the creation of a smartphone application for the reporting of incidents of racial abuse or discrimination, iReport.ie, which was launched in 2013. The goal is to collect data relating to racist incidents in Ireland to better understand the nature and frequency of these events. They have also reported on the perceptions of the victims of racial abuse, highlighting the inadequate response from the Garda√≠.

In 1885, he heard Wilhelm Liebknecht speak, and was inspired to join the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Support Association of German Shoemakers. Although, due to the Anti-Socialist Laws, this operated as a mutual benefit organisation rather than a trade union, Simon led a strike in Offenbach am Main later in the year. He was sacked for his trade union work on several occasions, but found work as a supervisor, and finally as managing director of a co-operative factory. The Support Association openly became a trade union in 1890, and in 1894, Simon was elected as the chair of its executive committee. In 1900, he was elected as the union's president. He led the union through five difficult years of strikes, lock outs, and economic struggles, but was considered a success in the role, and remained in post. In 1904, the union became the Central Union of Shoemakers of Germany. In 1907, the union led the formation of the International Federation of Boot and Shoe Operatives, and Simon became its first general secretary. That year, he was also elected to Nuremberg City Council, and the Bavarian Chamber of Deputies. In 1912, he was elected to the Reichstag, but in 1917, he left the SPD, joining the ;eft-wing Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). As a USPD member, he was elected to the Weimar National Assembly and the Weimar Reichstag, but he became associated with the right-wing of the party, and in 1922, he rejoined the SPD. In 1919, he briefly served as the Bavarian Minister for Trade, Commerce and Industry, but resigned in protest at the government's backing for the Whites in the Russian Civil War. In 1933, the Nazi government banned trade unions, and arrested Simon, taking him to Dachau concentration camp. He was released and engaged in underground trade union work, with Wilhelm Leuschner. In 1935, he was again arrested, taken to Dachau, and released after a few months. He survived the war, and in 1945, returned to local politics in Nuremberg. He also gave a speech at the founding conference of the new Leather Union, dying later in the event.

Leach is an American biochemist with extensive drug discovery experience in large pharmaceutical research laboratories. Her expertise in molecular pharmacology, signal transduction and protein kinases, has been used to establish mechanisms of toxicity for therapeutics such as the novel antibiotic linezolid (Zyvox).  Early life and education  Born in Akron, Ohio to Glenn and Margaret Leach, she was the third of four daughters. Leach graduated as valedictorian from Revere High School in Richfield Ohiio in 1973 and attended Ohio Wesleyan University, graduating magna cum laude with a BA in Biochemistry, in 1977. In the laboratory of William B. Pratt at the University of Michigan, Leach did graduate research focused on the regulation of glucocorticoid hormone action and received her Ph. D. from the Department of Pharmacology in 1981.  Scientific contributions  Leach continued her scientific research as a National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where she studied the cancer- related phorbol estrogen receptor in the laboratory of Peter Blumberg. Publications from the laboratory of Yasutomi Nishizuka on a newly discovered enzyme named protein kinase C (PKC) that was stimulated by phorbol ester led Leach to the realization that the phorbol estrogen receptor she was studying was in fact PKC. These fundamental discoveries in a burgeoning new field fueled Leach‚Äôs passion for kinases and in the broader field of signal transduction. Leach moved on to research in the pharmaceutical industry (at The Upjohn Company, which became the Pharmacia Corp and eventually at Pfizer, Inc.) where her expertise with kinases and signal transduction launched her career, enabling her to lead discovery teams in the fields of oncology, Alzheimer Disease, and calcium signaling, leading to her application of these scientific insights to understanding of drug safety issues, particularly for the novel class of oxazolidinone antibiotics such as linezolid. The approval of Zyvox to the antibiotic armentatrium in 2000 was hailed as a much needed breakthrough in addressing the antibiotic resistance crisis. However safety concerns during prolonged usage in some patients highlighted a need for understanding the molecular basis of the toxicity in humans in order to design safer next- generation antibiotics. Given the mechanism of action for oxazolidinones as protein translation disruptors in bacterial pathogens and the bacterial ancestry of mitochondria, Leach began pursuing research into the hypothesis that the toxicity to human cells was linked to inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Her lab generated significant amounts of data implicating the role of mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition in mammalian cellular toxicity. Their conclusive experiment was the direct demonstration of the absence of oxazolidinone toxicity in rho 0 cells, which contain mitochondria, but lack mitochondrial DNA and thus are unable to synthesize proteins. By showing mitochondrial protein synthesis was the link to Zyvox cytotoxicity in human cells, this research led to important advances in antibiotic safety and utilization of in vitro assays to predict in vivo toxicity. Leach went on to conduct cross-disciplinary efforts within Pfizer using chemistry-cell biology approaches to predict safety issues in vitro, long before the drug leads were tested in animals. Her kinase expertise helped connect scientists across a wide array of therapeutic discovery efforts within Pfizer where she led a coordinated kinase safety effort across this large multinational corporation. Tapping into her kinase expertise in drug discovery efforts, she became a scientific liaison to the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy at the University of Dundee School of Life Sciences. Her research at Pfizer continued to focus on in vitro predictions of compound safety, for kinase inhibitors as well as other drug discovery candidates and therapeutic agents. Leach‚Äôs scientific career included positions at increasing levels of Research Scientist levels, Associate Research Fellow, and leader of several discovery teams before being named Director of Academic Research Collaborations at Pfizer‚Äôs Centers for Therapeutic Innovations in Boston, MA. She now serves as an independent consultant, using her over 30 years of expertise to advise clients in various aspects of pharmaceutical discovery.

The battery was organized in early 1864 when the 13th Missouri Light Battery was reorganized in a process that may not have been officially approved; Captain Samuel Stanhope Harris commanded the new unit. The battery fought in the Camden Expedition in early 1864, seeing action in the Battle of Prairie D'Ane and the Battle of Poison Spring in April. In June, the battery was present at the Battle of Ditch Bayou. Harris' Battery accompanied Sterling Price during his raid into Missouri in late 1864, during which it fought at the battles of Pilot Knob, Glasgow, Little Blue River, Big Blue River, and Mine Creek, as well as several smaller skirmishes. At Mine Creek, the battery's cannons were captured. On May 26, 1865, the battery surrendered; the men of the battery were paroled. Service history=Organization and the Camden Expedition The origins of Harris' Battery date to early 1864, when the 13th Missouri Light Battery underwent a reorganization that may not have been officially sanctioned. Captain Daniel B. Griswold was replaced as commander of the battery by Captain Samuel Stanhope Harris when the battery was reorganized; the reasons for the change in command are unknown. General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the department in which the battery served, questioned the change in command and reorganization, but Harris retained command of the battery. After the reorganization, the battery served in the brigade of Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke and was armed with four 6-pounder smoothbore cannons. When Major General Frederick Steele of the Union Army began the Camden Expedition in the spring of 1864 to support the Red River Campaign, Harris' Battery was part of the Confederate force sent to confront Steele. On April 10, during the Battle of Prairie D'Ane, Harris' Battery, along with Collin's Missouri Battery, participated in an artillery duel with three Union batteries: the Springfield Illinois Light Artillery, Battery E, 2nd Missouri Light Artillery, and Voegele's Wisconsin Battery. The firefight began around 5:00 p.m. and continued until after sunset. The Confederate artillery fire was not very effective, as the Confederate cannons were of \\"old and inferior pattern\\" according to historian Michael J. Forsyth. On April 15, the battery was involved in a skirmish near Gallups; it next fought at the Battle of Poison Spring on the 18th. At Poison Spring, Harris' Battery was part of the brigade of Colonel Colton Greene. The battery was position on the right flank on the Confederate line and provided artillery support for a Confederate charge against a Union wagon train. On April 29, the battery accompanied Greene's brigade as it harassed Steele's retreating column, and saw some fighting. However, the battery was not engaged at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on the 30th. During June 1864, the battery operated against Union Navy vessels serving on the Mississippi River and inflicted damage on several gunboats and transports. On June 6, the battery was present at the Battle of Ditch Bayou, where it guarded Lake Village, Arkansas. Price's Raid Price's Missouri Raid in October 1864 The battery accompanied Major General Sterling Price during his raid into Missouri in late 1864. During the campaign, the battery only had three cannons, and was commanded by Lieutenant Thomas J. Williams. On September 27, at the Battle of Pilot Knob, Harris' Battery fired the opening shots of the fight, but was quickly silenced by Union counter-battery fire. The battery then participated in small fights at Union, Missouri on October 1, and at California, Missouri on October 9. On October 15, during the Battle of Glasgow, the battery participated in shelling the Union garrison. On October 21, the battery helped repulse a Union attack at the Battle of Little Blue River, and it also saw action at the Battle of the Big Blue River on October 23. On October 25, at the Battle of Mine Creek, Harris' Battery was positioned near the center of the Confederate line. A Union cavalry charge hit the Confederate line near where Harris' Battery was positioned, and the battery was left isolated. Two of the battery's cannons were captured as a result; although two were dragged some distance. However, even those two cannons were later captured. The battery suffered 35 casualties at Mine Creek. After the end of Price's Raid, the battery was transferred to Grand Ecore, Louisiana, where it was used to operate heavy artillery guarding the Red River. On November 19, the battery was officially designated the 4th Missouri Field Battery by Smith, although the moniker of Harris' Battery was still used to refer to the unit. On May 26, 1865, the battery surrendered; the men of the battery were paroled. When the paroles were issued, there were found to be 136 men in the battery. Historian James McGhee has speculated that many of the men were recruited during Price's Raid.

The region, like much of the northern English uplands, is sparsely populated, with scattered farming and hardy shepherding in river valleys. Because of this sparse population, 39% of the region is part of the Northumberland National Park in the southeast and several military assets are placed here, both modern and ancient. The NCA is of lower elevation to the Cheviot Hills to the east. The A68 is the only main road going through the region. Conifer plantations, moorland, bogs, wet heaths make up the landscape of the region, which only allows for rough grazing of sheep in most areas outside of the valleys. Afforestation is a major environmental factor within the 20th and 21st centuries, as Fielder Forest is the largest planted forest in northern Europe and has destroyed many native mires and peat bogs of the region. As such in the 21st century preserving the moors has been a top priority in the region as its habitat is home to high biodiversity and the region also serves as an important storer of carbon in its moors. Hydrology The region is drained through a measure of rivers flowing both to the west and to the east. The rivers North Tyne and Rede, starting at the Scottish border to the north, form valleys that cut through the plateau and form semi-arable valleys in North Tynedale and Redesdale. These rivers are both tributaries of the River Tyne, which flows to the southeast into the North Sea. The River Lyne and Irthing, which start further south than the former two rivers flow south-west to the Solway Firth in the Irish Sea. The waters of the North Tyne are controlled by the Kielder Water reservoir, opened in 1982, which is situated in the north of the NCA, surrounding the reservoir is a large area of afforested wood called the Kielder Forest.

Crummy‚Äôs Functional Categories for Small Finds  Crummy's publication The Roman Small Finds from Excavations in Colchester 1971-9 was one of the first to analyse and present archaeological artefacts (small finds) within ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô as opposed to ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô categories. Although this system of categorisation has been questioned, for simplifying objects‚Äô multiple functionality, it remains highly influential especially within Romano-British archaeology. The subjects of the functional categories are: Category 1: Objects of personal adornment or dress; Category 2: Toilet, surgical or pharmaceutical instruments; Category 3: Objects used in the manufacture or working of textiles; Category 4: Household utensils and furniture; Category 5: Objects used for recreational purposes; Category 6: Objects employed in weighing and measuring; Category 7: Objects used for or associated with written communications; Category 8: Objects associated with transport. Category 9: Buildings and services; Category 10: Tools; Category 11: Fasteners and fittings; Category 12: Objects associated with agriculture, horticulture and animal husbandry.

Milligan was a merchant and slave-factor, and was largely responsible for the construction of the West India Docks. After being put in storage in 1943, it was re-erected by the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1997. On 9 June 2020, the statue was removed, coinciding with a drive to review slaver statues launched by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.  History  Robert Milligan (1746‚Äì1809) was a prominent Scottish merchant, ship-owner and slave-factor, who was the driving force behind the construction of the West India Docks in London. The statue was commissioned by the West India Dock Company from the sculptor Richard Westmacott in May 1809, following Milligan's death.Robert Milligan statue, Museum of London From its installation in 1813 the statue stood by the Hibbert Gate until 1875 when it was moved to the North Gate. It was put into storage in 1943, where it remained until 1997, when it was re-erected at its original location on the West India Dock by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The Museum of London Docklands opened in buildings directly behind the statue in 2003.Culture24.org.uk: MGM 2003 - A Capital Addition, Museum In Docklands Now Open. Emma Midgley, 23 May 2003 \\"Father of the Island\\" in 1998 Detail of the relief on the pedestal In 1998 an article in The Islander, a community newspaper sponsored by the Association of Island Communities on the local Isle of Dogs, published a photograph of the statue with another featuring Max Hebditch, at the time director of the Museum of London Docklands, with Roger Squire, at that time the Joint Chief Executive of the London Docklands Development Corporation, who had made the arrangements to return the statue to its original place. The article argued that Milligan was a genius who had persuaded the city merchants to build the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs, rather than in Wapping. Dubbing Milligan \\"the father of the Isle of Dogs\\", the article called for Wednesday 12 July 2000 to be celebrated as the bicentennial of the laying of the docks' foundation stone in 1800. Shrouding in 2007 In 2007, when the Museum of London Docklands opened the London, Sugar and Slavery gallery, the connection between the West India Dock, the sugar warehouses which now house the museum and the exploitation of enslaved Africans on West Indian sugar plantations was made explicit. The 1811 portrait of George Hibbert by Thomas Lawrence had been moved from a place where he had been revered as playing a heroic role in the creation of the dock to a position in the new gallery with a caption clarifying his role as a politician and slave owner who resisted the abolition of slavery. In November, at the time of the opening of the exhibition, the statue of Robert Milligan was shrouded in black cloth, tied up with rope ‚Äì although this was removed after the event. The museum also elicited the thoughts of members of the public as regards the statue in relation to Milligan's involvement with the enslavement of Africans.  Removal in 2020  The vandalized statue in 2020 Following the vandalism and removal of Edward Colston's statue in Bristol by anti-racism protesters in response to the killing of George Floyd, a petition was launched to remove Robert Milligan's likeness at West India Quay in London Docklands. Set up by Labour councillor Ehtasham Haquehttps://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=4122, it attracted 4,000 signatures in less than two days. He described the fact that the statue still existed in 2020 as \\"an insult to humanity\\". A series of evening protests were planned. The statue was covered with a shroud by protestors, and had placards attached to it. On 9 June 2020, the Museum of London Docklands issued a statement saying how this made the statue an \\"object of protest\\", and said that they believed it should remain so for as long as the statue remained. They added that they \\"advocate for the statue of Robert Milligan to be removed on the grounds of its historical links to colonial violence and exploitation.\\" Later that day, the statue was removed by the local authority, and landowners the Canal & River Trust, to \\"recognise the wishes of the community\\". The statue was removed on the same day that Sadiq Khan announced plans to found a Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm.

He lived in the Roman region of Tarquinia, today's Italian Tuscany. His dealings are described in the Rerum rusticarum libri III by Marcus Terentius Varro, and a century later in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia.  Wild animal husbandry  Fulvius Lippinus owned a domain of forty jugera in the vicinity of Tarquinia, a large domain in Statona, and some domains elsewhere. In these areas he had farms where methods were developed for keeping game such as hares, deer, and wild sheep. Lippinus was the first Roman to create game parks for keeping wild boar and pig, among others  Snail breeding  However, Lippinus gained most fame by keeping and breeding snails. He built the first parks in Tarquinia, shortly before the civil war broke out between Pompey and C√¶sar. With the construction and exploitation of these so-called cochlearia, Fulvius Lippinus was the first (documented) snail farmer in history. The cochlearia were parks surrounded by a water channel, to prevent the escape of the snails parked in there. These parks were equipped with an irrigation system that was the predecessor of the current agricultural sprinkler system: water pipes with a rose-shaped head were placed against a surface in such fashion that the water burst into a fine mist and thus provided the snails with the necessary moisture. Lippinus had a separate park for each snail species, each of which was marketed for its specific qualities. For example, he had small white snails from nearby Reate, large snails from Illyricum, medium-sized snails from Africa, and particularly large snails, also from Africa, the so-called Solitannae, which were very prolific.  Preparation of escargot  Lippinus fed the snails with its own developed formula based on boiled wine, (corn) flour, and herbs. The snails would thrive on this diet. Pliny the Elder claimed that some snails grew so large that their houses could contain up to 80 quadrants. With his innovative ideas for cooking snails, he also took Roman gastronomy to the next level: in preparation he would first lock the snails with milk, salt and bread in a jar with air holes for a few days, with the milk being changed daily and refreshed. As soon as the snails had swollen to the point of no longer being able to retreat to their homes, they were fried in oil or grilled on the fire and served with herbs and sauces.  Snail trade  Consuming escargot would initially only be popular among the wealthy Romans. But Lippinus' methods were so successful that he eventually had to import his snails from all corners of the world to meet the growing demand from Rome. He must have been a real entrepreneur, because he even set up a ferry service to deliver regularly from Sardinia, Sicily, Capri, and the Spanish and North African coasts. He was so successful in his endeavors that others, including the well-known Romans Lucius Lucullus and Quintus Hortensius, would follow his example.  Popularization of escargot  The idea of fresh snails apparently caught on, as many Roman citizens began growing snails at home, and the cochlerium became a common sight not only in Rome, but throughout the Roman Empire. Thanks to Lippinus, escargot found its place in the ancient Roman kitchen around the start of the era. Pliny the Younger treated his visitors at home with an exclusive menu composed of \\"a leaf of lettuce, three snails, two eggs, spelled mixed with honey, and snow\\", a recipe from Lippinus. His recipes even were echoed in De re coquinaria, the cookbook by Marcus Gavius Apicius, published during the first century.

Cola Debrot introduced him: \\"The title refers to the name of an Indian class of serfs, the Yanacuna, who were increasingly driven from their land and family after the destruction of the Inca society by the conquistadors.\\" The collection contained 205 poems, and is well received, but Ashetu stopped publishing. He kept on writing, but never submitted them to a publisher. The legacy of his unpublished poems was handled by Michiel van Kempen. Van Ommeren never used the name Bernardo Ashetu in his other writings, and signed his letters Kamanda meaning \\"I am a negro.\\" The name Kamanda is also mentioned on his grave. Later the poetry started appearing in the Spiegel van de Surinaamse po√´zie (1995) and magazines like Dietsche Warande, Bzzlletin, De Ware Tijd Literair, De Tweede Ronde, and many others. In 2002, a collection was published by Gerrit Komrij titled Dat ik zong., and in 2011, Michiel van Kempen published Dat ik je liefheb ReferencesExternal links *Bernardo Ashetu at Digital Library for Dutch Literature (in Dutch) *Bernardo Ashetu at Werkgroep Cara√Øbische Letteren (in Dutch) Category:1929 births Category:1982 deaths Category:20th-century poets Category:Dutch male poets Category:Dutch sailors Category:People from Paramaribo Category:Surinamese poets ","title":"Bernardo Ashetu"},{"id":"64225798","text":"Moorfields is an area of Bristol, England. It lies in the east of the city, east of Barton Hill, south of Easton and west of Redfield. The name is no longer in common use, and the area is now generally considered parts of Easton and Redfield. Moorfields derives its name from a wealthy Bristol fishmonger named Samuel Moore, who invested in land in the area at the beginning of the 19th century. He built 40 cottages and an imposing residence (Moore's Lodge) around a square called Moorfields Square south of Church Road (then known as Redfield Road). The Lodge was demolished in the early 1900s. The cottages were demolished in 1930. Further development followed in the 1870s, when hundreds of terraced houses were built north of Church Road around Russell Town Avenue (then known as Dean Lane). This working class area survived as a distinct community until it was redeveloped in the 1950s and 1960s. The City Academy Bristol now occupies much of the site. In 1873 the growing population led to the formation of a new ecclesiastical parish of Moorfields from parts of the parishes of St George and Easton. The parish church of St Matthew, Moorfields was constructed in Gothic style at the corner of Church Road and Cowper Street. The church was closed in 1999, and has now been converted into apartments and offices. Moorfields now forms part of the parish of St Luke, Barton Hill with Christ Church and St Matthew, Moorfields.

The church is headquartered in Hereford in the United Kingdom with locations in Africa, North America, Asia and Europe. Freedom Church is a member of the Evangelical Alliance  History  Freedom Church was founded as New Life Church by Pastors Gary and Heather Snowzell in 1988. Originally situated in a small market town in Herefordshire, in around 2005 it moved to Hereford and was renamed Freedom Church. In 2011, Freedom Church partnered with the Southern Baptist megachurch NewSpring Church in South Carolina. The purpose of the partnership was to help Freedom Church plant churches all over the world. This arrangement came to an end in December 2017. In 2015, Freedom Church started to give 10% of its income as a tithe to NewSpring Church, though this has since ceased. Freedom Church's first planted church was in Cardiff in 2011, and it has since started locations in Africa, North America, Asia and Europe. In 2015, Freedom Church's location in Hereford moved location to a converted cinema and nightclub. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Freedom Church in Worcester, England supported a local food bank with storage space.  Music  Freedom Church has produced 3 albums, 2 singles and an EP. Albums * Thunder. Reign (2018) * Uncharted (2015) * Everything Changes (2012) Singles and EPs * Courage & Fire - EP (2009) * Running The Race (Live At The Cave) - Single (2018) * This is Love - Single (2014)  Media  Freedom Church has a YouTube channel and its messages have been shown on the TV channels TBN UK and TBN Africa.  Freedom Heroes  Freedom Church in Kampala, Uganda runs an organisation called 'Freedom Heroes' which takes homeless boys aged 12‚Äì21 off the streets of Kampala, Uganda and supports them with housing, a \\"Street School\\", and \\"Street Church\\" with the stated aim of reuniting them with their families. Sponsors from the United States can visit their beneficiaries on a missions trip with NewSpring Church. Freedom Heroes is a registered charity in both Uganda and the United Kingdom.  Notable people  Stuart Anderson, who sat on Herefordshire Council as councillor for Kings Acre ward and was later elected as the Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton South West in the 2019 general election, and whose wife is also a member of the church, is a member of the church and has appeared on Songs of Praise to promote the church. His former business eTravelSafety previously shared the same registered address as Freedom Church Hereford. Freedom Church has also maintained a connection with NewSpring Church's founder Perry Noble, who continued to deliver sermons for Freedom Church after being ousted from NewSpring Church.  Controversies  In 2011, the Hereford Times publicised allegations of arranged marriages, fight clubs, and mass baptisms. They also alleged that the church encouraged its young members to turn to church leaders for relationship advice rather than friends or family, and that the church and its youth group, 2XL, had links to Herefordshire Council. 2XL reportedly received council funding to deliver certain youth services in local schools. \\\\- Freedom Church strenuously denied the claims, saying \\"We have never encouraged 14-year-old girls to 'consider marrying older men'\\", \\"Nor have we ever implied that if a girl were to be baptised 'it will lead to a relationship with someone in the church'\\", and \\"We do not brainwash people [...] if Freedom Church is not the place for [new people], they are quite free to leave\\". In 2012, the police were called on Freedom Church volunteers, who were giving out sweets with attached leaflets to children outside the gates of Whitecross Hereford High School in order to promote the Church's youth club. In 2013, a Freedom Church staff member at the newly-opened Siem Reap church attracted criticism after posting that Cambodia \\"...is a spiritually dead place but there is an increasing anticipation amongst the team and a sense that this city is ours. Despite all the false worship, rampant sex trafficking and the go-to party destination in Southeast Asia, we know that Jesus has given us this city\\". Freedom Church were accused of proselytising, which is technically illegal in Cambodia (although rarely enforced in practice), and preying on the poor.  Swansea University  In 2015, it was reported that the church was banned from Swansea University campus by the university after concerns were raised about student welfare. The University said, \\"Concerns have been raised by various organisations and individuals in Wales and elsewhere about the operational methods used by the Freedom Church to recruit members by targeting vulnerable members of society and their cultic style of operation\\". A Swansea University Spokesperson explained: \\"Only affiliated faith organisations are permitted to hold services on the campus. Members of the Freedom Church were not removed from campus but the 250 posters which appeared just before the Freshers arrived were taken down. Only approved posters are permitted on campus.\\" A later clarification by a spokesperson for the University stated: \\"We have not officially banned this organisation from holding services and events on campus. Permission is not granted to any faith group unless they are a society registered with the student‚Äôs union. The Freedom Church is not registered with the student‚Äôs union. This is what we meant by the term affiliated.\\" An ex-member told Wales Online that the church targeted vulnerable young students, putting a wedge between them and their families, discouraging them from having relationships outside of the church, making it hard for them to leave, and using them as cash cows ‚Äì pressuring them for ¬£1,000 to take part in 'leadership courses' at the church's headquarters in Hereford. It was also claimed that members \\"never\\" had relationships outside of the church. The church responded by saying that it was \\"more transparent than just about any church\\", and the Evangelical Alliance denied that the Freedom Church is a cult, saying that it has worked alongside the organisation for over 20 years. The national director for Evangelical Alliance Wales Reverend Elfed Godding said, \\"We are fully supportive of what they do. They're an orthodox Christian church; they have a good track record of social engagement, of caring for needy people. I'm not quite sure what the issue of complaint was about.\\"  Locations  Freedom Church has churches across the world, with locations in the following cities: ; Europe * United Kingdom ** Hereford ** Cardiff ** Worcester ** Birmingham ** Cheltenham ** Glasgow * Netherlands ** Rotterdam * Cyprus ** Limassol ;Africa * Uganda ** Kampala * South Africa ** Cape Town ; Asia * Cambodia ** Siam Reap ** Battambang ** Phnom Penh ;North America * United States of America ** Raleigh, North Carolina * India ** Chennai ** Bengaluru  References  External links  * Website * Freedom Church on YouTube * Charity Details Category:Evangelical megachurches in United Kingdom Category:Churches in Herefordshire ","title":"Freedom Church"},{"id":"64225863","text":"Deep Soul is a studio album by American saxophonist Ronnie Laws, released in 1992 by Par Records.

The shot is commonly made with vodka or other hard liqours, and is commonly associate with Spring break. Shots made with non- branded or unflavored gelatin are sometimes known as jelly shots or gelatin shots.  Description  A jello shot is made by adding an alcoholic beverage to gelatin mixture, complementing the water normally used to make gelatin. The shots are a named after popular gelatin Jell-O, though the term jello-shot has since become genericized. The shot is normally served in shot glasses, plastic cups, or ice-cube trays. Jello shots are commonly made with vodka, but can be prepared using almost any type of hard liqueur, grain alcohol, or wine. Fruit juices or flavored alcohol can be used in the shot to add extra flavor or mask the taste of alcohol. Proper proportioning of alcohol and water is needed to ensure that the shot mixture is properly set - this proportioning can vary based on the type of alcohol used. Some liquids like pineapple juice will disrupt the ability of the gelatin mixture to set and should be avoided. Jello shots are commonly associated with Spring break, though variations exist for other holidays. The shot is popular due to its low cost and easy preparation. Some vendors sell pre-made gelatin shots for consumption.  History  Green jello shots made with Soju The exact origin of the jello shot is unknown, as gelatin and alcohol mixtures predate the commercialization of Jell-O in 1897. Several precursors to jello shots have been described, such a recipe in the 14th century Le Viandier de Taillevent for aspic flavored with wine. The invention of gelatin powders in the 19th century resulted in the popularization of jellies, some of which involved combining alcohol with gelatin; famed bartender Jerry Thomas included a recipe for a \\"punch jelly\\" in his 1862 work How to Mix Drinks that called for adding isinglass gelatin to a bowl of fruit punch spiked with cognac and rum. The jello shot is sometimes attributed to 19th-century chief Marie-Antoine Car√™me, who created a recipe for pink champagne jelly flavored with orange flowers. The San Francisco Chronicle claims to have published the first recipe for a jello shot, as in 1902 the newspaper published a recipe for a \\"wine jelly\\" made with lemon Jell-O, orange slices, and sherry. Modern jello shots originated in the 1950s when Jell-O was at the height of its popularity in the United States. Multiple sources attribute the creation of the modern jello shot to American satirist and musician Tom Lehrer, who claimed to have invented the jello shot as a way to circumvent a ban on alcohol at a navy base he was stationed at. According to Lehrer, he and a friend were barred from bring alcoholic beverages to a Christmas party at a naval base, and so the two mixed orange Jell-O with vodka in cups so that the mixture could be smuggled into the party. Comedian Luke Ski later wrote a song celebrating Lehrer's creation of the shot. Changing tastes and economic trends resulted in a decline of Jell-O sales in the 1960s and 70s. However, Jello shots remained in demand, reaching their now- established level of popularity in the 1980s.

He served as Commandant of the Military Territory of Zinder (modern-day Niger) from 1908 to 1911, and Commissioner from 1913 to 1915. Venel was in command of the 11th Colonial Infantry Division, part of the Corps exp√©ditionnaire d'Orient, from August to November 1917, fighting in the Macedonian front.  Early life and education  Paul C√©lestin Marie Joseph Venel was born on 25 January 1864 in Hesse, the son of Dominique Auguste Venel and M√©lanie B√©na. His father Auguste was a local teacher who opted for France and moved to Seichamps, after the annexation of a part of his native province by Germany following the Franco- Prussian War. Paul enrolled at the Saint-Cyr military academy on 30 October 1882. He graduated 144th of 406 students in the promotion (class) \\"Black Pavillions\\".  Service in the Marines  He became a sub-lieutenant in the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment in Cherbourg on 1 October 1884. Initially, Venel didn't display all the zeal required of an officer, but worked well under the guidance of an officer. He was dispatched to Cochinchina in 1885. Twelve years later, he served for the first time in Eastern Europe, dispatched to Crete with his battalion. This majority Greek island revolted against the Ottoman Empire in 1896. Venel served as part of the International Squadron, a naval squadron formed in early 1897 by a number of Great Powers to intervene in the conflict. Embarking from Marseille on 15 July 1897, Venel arrived in Sitia on the 20th, but he was evacuated on 23 October for health reasons. Assigned to the 1st Malagasy Tirailleur Regiment in Tamatave on 25 May 1898, he left the 8th Marine Infantry with a severe remark from the corps commander, chastising his work ethic. Arriving at Tamatave on 15 June, he was dispatched to the 13th Marine Regiment in Antananarivo on 1 September, where he was lauded as a suitable officer. Assigned to the area inhabited by the Bara in Ivohibe, he led a series of operations against the Tambavala in September 1899, a part of the pacification of French Madagascar. On 25 April 1900, he was transferred to the 4th Marine Infantry Regiment (renamed the 4th Colonial Garrison Regiment on 1 January 1901) at Toulon, promoted to chef de bataillon on 5 July, the day before his departure for France. Assigned to the 4th Colonial Garrison Regiment, Venel was dispatched on 6 May to the 8th Army Regiment in Toulon, where he was rated as \\"excellent\\" during fall maneuvers. Returning to Saigon on 27 April 1902, he joined the 1st Regiment of Annamite Riflemen on October 28. He was detached to Chantaboun, a territory of the Kingdom of Siam occupied by the French army as a guarantee after the Franco-Siamese War of 1893. Venel usefully employed Siamese officers in local reconnaissance missions. He was reproached for his leniency towards an indigenous non-commissioned officer guilty of brutality against a rifleman in 1904.  Governor of Niger  Venel was dispatched to Africa on 14 December 1905. He was assigned to the 2nd Tirailleur Regiment in Kati, commanding the area of Bobo-Dioulasso. He became lieutenant colonel on 23 June 1907. On 16 May 1908 became commandant of the Military Territory of Zinder (today Niger) and went to serve his post at Zinder. He was responsible for the defense of 2200km of Saharan border, as well as 800km along British northern Nigeria. He met with Fran√ßois-Henry Laperrine in June 1909 in Niamey where they redrew the border between French Algeria and Niger. According to Venel's wishes, the capital of the Colony of Niger was transferred from Niamey to Zinder in 1911 and served as capital of the colony until 1926. During his eighteen months of presence, he completed the organization of the m√©hariste units, which reestablished order in the Azbin and protected the subordinate population from looters. His troops were shown to be capable of inflicting serious setbacks on two strong rezzous (raiding parties). First, they clashed with a large band from Borkou and Tripolitania north of Bilma. After that, with a large gathering from Tafilalt around 600 kilometers north of Timbuktu. Venel subdued the Tuareg nomads, abolished the slave trade, and oversaw the economic growth of sedentary populations, allowing for the extraction of salt from the Taoudenni and Kaouar mines. Paul left Niamey on 15 February 1910 to return to France. He then completed an internship with the 60th Artillery Regiment at Troyes, which he commanded several times and with which he attended the artillery shooting course at Mailly-le-Camp. On 21 December 1911, he joined the 4th Colonial Infantry Regiment in Toulon, where he was applauded for his mild approach to knowledge transfer to his subordinates. After becoming colonel on 27 March 1913, Venel was appointed Commissioner of Niger on 28 April. He took his post at Zinder via Dakar and Dahomey. Immediately, he had to take care of the last details of the supply of the column situated on the western slope of the Tibesti Mountains. Once Germany declared war on 3 August 1914, he contributed to the war effort by operating numerous levies of personnel and material intended for reinforcement of the column operating in northern Cameroon. Repatriated for health reasons after 28 months in Africa, he returned to Paris on 4 October 1915 via Lagos, England and Boulogne-sur-Mer. He immediately benefited from a three-month convalescent leave in Lyon, from 11 October 1915 to 10 January 1916, because of the various illnesses he suffered from, especially malaria and diabetes.  World War I  On 15 January, Venel was put in command of the 97th Infantry Division, a unit of four battalions which contributed to the defense of a difficult sector north of Arras. He suffered through trench warfare at Givenchy-en-Gohelle and at Vimy Ridge in January and February 1916. After that, he was sent to Verdun, where he fought from 15 March to 5 April. Hired on 16 March 1916 at Vaux-devant-Damloup and at the Dicourt Farm, he was withdrawn from the front on 3 April, before holding the sector of Flirey and Varg√©vaux Pond. On 20 May, Venel was given acting command of the 31st Colonial Brigade, serving in the Somme department. Withdrawn from the front in early June, he occupied the sector of Dompierre from 22 June. On 4 July, he participated in the Battle of the Somme, at Barleux on 10 July and at La Maisonnette on the 20th. Under these circumstances, Venel proved satisfactory. At the time of his departure, on 5 November, his superior judged him worthy of commanding a division. Serbian First Army ≈Ωivojin Mi≈°iƒá near Monastir, December 1916. Venel was appointed brigadier general on 1 October, when he took over the leadership of the 22nd Colonial Brigade (part of the Corps exp√©ditionnaire d'Orient), created on the previous day in Toulouse, on 2 November, and landed in Thessaloniki in early December, before joining his men on the Battle of the Crna Bend. The 21st and 22nd Colonial Brigades merged to form the 11th Colonial Infantry Division on 1 January 1917. The division occupied the sector between the river Crna and the Prilep road, north of Monastir. From 16 March it attempted to conquer Monastir, succeeding in seizing the town and the village of Krklino from 16 to 18 March. On April 25, it moved towards the Crna Bend and deeper into Pelagonia, retreating towards Bare≈°ani on 21 May. On 1 June, Venel was put at the head of the provisional division of Thessaly, formed on 26 May. Greece was undergoing the National Schism, with King Constantine I favoring the Central Powers. On 11 June 1917, the representative of the Entente Charles Jonnart forced Constantine to abdicate in favor of his younger son Alexander. The former Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, favorable to the Entente, returned to power. During this delicate transfer of power, Venel‚Äôs role was to monitor monarchist elements in Thessaly, while other Allied contingents landed in Athens or occupied the Isthmus of Corinth. His superior, General Maurice Sarrail, was satisfied with Venel completing this mission and wrote positively of him on 18 June. Venel then occupied the port of Volos, the cities of Farsala, Lamia, Trikala, and Bralos. From 2 July to 15 August, Venel was again northeast of Monastir commanding the 22nd Colonial Brigade, provisionally added to the 11th Colonial Infantry Division. The front faced a certain lethargy, which lasted for months. Venel handed the command of his division over on 22 June 1918 and returned to France. At the disposal of the Ministry of War, Venel was placed in the command reserve for the 5th Army under General Henri Berthelot on 24 July. The 5th Army had just participated in the Second Battle of the Marne. On 17 September, he took over as acting head of the 127th Infantry Division, which held an area north of Sancy until the 20th. This division immediately stood out in the pursuit of the German Army on the Chemin des Dames. It seized the fort of La Malmaison and crossed the Ailette on 12 October, taking part in the attacks against the Hunding-Stellung fortified line, taken on 19 and 20 October, and in the Battle of the Serre from 20 to 30 October, after which it was removed from the front. During these operations, Venel demonstrated great skill. Evacuated for health reasons (\\"severe chest flu\\") on 8 November, he was replaced in his command two days later, hospitalized in Chartres and placed on 4 December at the disposal of the general commanding the French forces in Italy. He was appointed commander in the Corps exp√©ditionnaire d'Orient, commanding the Allied occupation troops around Cattaro and Montenegro, where the situation was then very tense, culminating in the Christmas Uprising in late December. According to Franchet d'Esp√®rey, Venel \\"showed bravery and decisiveness by being skillful in the midst of the shooting between the two lines of combat\\". In actuality, Venel's troops, like France, favored Belgrade, and the Greens, loyalists of the exiled King Nicholas, were disarmed.  Death  The harsh Montenegrin climate, as well as the quarrels between the Allies (especially Italians and Serbs), was detrimental to Venel's health. On a one- month rest leave on 21 April 1919 in Vichy (extended by another month on 21 May), he was appointed deputy to 1st Maritime Prefect in Cherbourg on 18 June. The very day he took up his post, 28 June, he was hospitalized for pulmonary congestion. He resumed command on 28 July, but returned to the local maritime hospital on 8 August. On 23 August, the chief medical officer diagnosed pulmonary emphysema with \\"intermittent but very painful\\" asthma attacks and hypotension. Venel was then relieved of his duties and put on convalescent leave for three months on 2 September 1919. Still, he was proposed for the rank of division general on 9 November. Venel withdrew to Nancy, where he was granted extensions of leave (lasting one month, effective 2 March 1920 \\"on an exceptional basis due to service rendered\\"). On 19 March, the Minister of War, Andr√© Lef√®vre urged him to retire. Venel died a few days later from a heart condition at the Bon Secours hospital, Nancy, where he had been treated since January for chronic hypertensive nephritis, and where his right leg had just been amputated from the thigh down on 18 March after a dry gangrene coupled with arthritis caused complications with his femoral artery, in turn influenced by frostbite of the foot in 1917. On 17 April 1925, the medical advisory commission found that the illness causing the death of general Venel was not contracted during service.

The album was named after Skellern's first single, issued in August 1972 and a number 3 hit on the UK Singles Chart. Despite this success, the album failed to chart, as did the follow-up single \\"Our Jackie's Getting Married\\". The album established Skellern's unique musical style, encompassing influences from church music and northern brass band music, reflecting Skellern's Lancashire origin. A classically trained pianist, Skellern wrote the album while working as a porter at a hotel. You're a Lady was recorded in five sessions at Decca Studios in London. The album was reissued in 2019 by Mint Audio as part of Peter Skellern: The Complete Decca Recordings, a release crowdfunded by fans through a Kickstarter campaign.  Background  Born in Bury, Lancashire, Peter Skellern began piano lessons aged 9. By the age of 12, he was playing trombone in his school brass band, and by 16 he'd joined the National Youth Brass Band and was organist and choirmaster of St Paul's Church in Bury. He went on to study Music at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. After graduating with honours in 1968, Skellern struggled to make headway in a career as a concert pianist and instead focused on pursuing popular music. Skellern relocated to Dorset to live in a cottage in Shaftesbury with his wife Diana, and worked as a porter in a local hotel. During this time, Skellern wrote his first song \\"You're a Lady\\". Answering a Melody Maker advert, Skellern joined the band The March Hare as keyboardist. This gave the classically-trained musician experience in rock and pop. In June 1969, The March Hare released their only single on Deram Records - \\"Have We Got News For You\\" backed with \\"I Could Make It There With You\\" - both Skellern compositions. The March Hare changed their name and style in 1970. Now making music with a country flavour, they became Harlan County. They released a self-titled album on short-lived Philips subsidiary Nashville, featuring three tracks co-written by Skellern, but failed to achieve any success and disbanded. Skellern continued to pursue a career in pop, represented by the band's manager Johnny Stirling. Stirling shopped Skellern's compositions around music publishers, leading to a record deal with Decca for recording and Warner Music for publishing. The deal was signed on 5 May 1972. Skellern wrote the album in the summerhouse at his home in Shaftesbury. He kept his piano in the summerhouse so as not to bother anyone with his practice. Skellern's musical influences at this time included Liszt, Chopin, Marc Bolan, Cole Porter and Randy Newman.  Recording  Peter Skellern photographed by Michael Putland. The recording of the album commenced at Decca's Studio 4 based in Tollington Park, London on 3 July 1972. Skellern was joined by handpicked session musicians, arranger Andrew Pryce Jackman and a choir consisting of members of The Congregation, a British pop ensemble formed by Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway whose recording of \\"Softly Whispering I Love You\\" had hit number 4 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1972. The session produced three tracks: the rock and roll-flavoured \\"Roll On Rhoda\\", \\"Manifesto\\" (recorded with the working title \\"Let The Tiger Roar\\") and \\"Apollo 11\\". The following day, the Hanwell Band was added to the lineup and \\"You're a Lady\\" was recorded in six takes. Skellern sought to recapture the \\"speechless amazement\\" he felt playing in the National Youth Brass Band in his youth by using the brass band on the record. The euphonium, played by John Luckett, is prominently featured. Described as a \\"a breathless love song\\", \\"You're a Lady\\" was issued as Skellern's first single on 11 August 1972. The single was placed on Radio Luxembourg on a pay-for-play basis, but was then picked up by Terry Wogan on his BBC Radio 2 programme. It was Skellern's first and greatest chart success, peaking at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. and selling over 800,000 copies It also charted at number 50 on the United States Billboard Hot 100. \\"You're a Lady\\" became Skellern's signature song. He performed the song live on many occasions prior to his retirement in 2001. It became a constant feature of his double act with Richard Stilgoe. Recording continued on 7 August, this time at Decca Studio 2 in West Hampstead. This session produced \\"Every Home Should Have One\\", compared lyrically to the work of Peter Tinniswood by one reviewer, and \\"Our Jackie's Getting Married\\", issued as the follow-up single to \\"You're a Lady\\" on 24 November 1972. The song's lyrics are written from the perspective of the titular Jackie, addressing his lover and telling her of the commotion he anticipates there will be when he tells his family about his plans to marry her. One verse has Jackie mimicking his mother's excited reaction to the news. Musically, the song incorporates an off-key piano and a brass band, which Skellern said nostalgically reminded him of a Northern wedding. Towards the end, a brief excerpt from Mendelssohn's Wedding March played on the Guildford Cathedral organ momentarily interrupts all other instrumentation. Another feature is a 'wound-up choir', a favourite studio effect of Skellern's. This effect was achieved by recording the choir at a slower speed making it sound higher and faster on normal speed playback. Skellern worried that fans wouldn't like \\"Our Jackie's Getting Married\\" as much as \\"You're a Lady\\" due to its difference in style. The single failed to chart. Skellern would later say the single was issued due to pressure from higher authorities. However, the song was a runner-up for Ivor Novello Award for Best Novelty Song in 1973. The next session on 10 August 1972 was the most productive. It produced basic tracks for \\"Now I've Seen The Light\\" (called at this stage \\"Eyes To Lead The Blind\\"), \\"Ain't Life Something\\" (under the working title \\"The Veranda Song\\"), \\"Don't It Matter Anymore), \\"My Lonely Room\\", \\"A Sad Affair\\" and \\"All Last Night\\". These tracks were completed with overdubs over the next few days, before recording was paused for a few weeks for Skellern to promote the single release of \\"You're a Lady\\". The album was completed on 29 August 1972 with the recording of \\"Rock On\\" and the \\"funky\\" \\"Keep In In Your Own Backyard\\". The shuffling style of \\"Rock On\\" has garnered comparisons to the work of Randy Newman (particularly Newman's song \\"Mama Told Me Not to Come\\") and Alan Price.  Release and reception  You're a Lady was released in late 1972. Despite the success of the title track, the album was a commercial disappointment. It failed to chart, and by April 1973 had sold only 6,000 copies. Skellern was reluctant to perform live, feeling he wasn't ready. On May 29 1973, Skellern made his first live appearance, performing at a concert at the London Palladium for the charity KIDS. Upon release, Deborah Thomas of the Daily Mirror commented that You're a Lady has \\"a few interesting songs and a lot of sincerity, but some are too close to Gilbert and others haven't been developed far enough... ...for all that, I like it\\". Billboard recommended the album, noting \\"many flavours of music with steel guitar and banjo highlighted\\" and considered \\"Manifesto\\" and \\"Ain't Life Something\\" highlights. Harry Nilsson was reportedly a fan of the album. You're a Lady was issued on CD in 1989 by London Records, but availability was brief. In 2019, Mint Audio issued a remastered version of the album as part of Peter Skellern: The Complete Decca Recordings. This release was produced by sound engineer Richard Moore and crowdfunded by fans through a Kickstarter campaign. Skellern collaborators Richard Stilgoe and Tim Rice were listed among the executive producers. In a five-star review of the set, Richard Allen of Shindig! described Skellern as \\"unjustly neglected\\", commenting \\"Lush production values were a signature of his hit \\"You're a Lady\\" but that recording was just one aspect of his style\\" and praising Skellern's \\"distinctive vulnerable voice\\". Writing in Record Collector, David Quantick said \\"the album is full of inventiveness and Skellern‚Äôs many voices, from the seaside postcard melancholy of \\"A Sad Affair\\" to the ragtime fun of \\"Now I‚Äôve Seen It All\\" [sic]\\". Quantick opined \\"It sounds like nothing else released in a decade where anything was possible\\". Joe Marchese of The Second Disc described the set as \\"a stellar, persuasive tribute to the late artist\\", adding \\"as one of Peter Skellern‚Äôs songs goes, \\"Every Home Should Have One\\" indeed\\".

Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Bust of cardinal Roberto Bellarmino, 1621-1624, Chiesa del Ges√π, Rome Christ in Glory with Saints and Odoardo Farnese or 'Christ in Glory with Odoardo Farnese and Saints Peter, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene, Hermenegild and Edward is a painting by Annibale Carracci. Placed in the Eremo di Camldoli either early in its life or straight after its creation, at the end of the 17th century Ferdinando II de' Medici moved it to the Galleria Palatina in Florence, where it still hangs. Roberto Zapperi, Odoardo Farnese, principe e cardinale, in Les Carrache et les d√©cors profanes. Actes du colloque de Rome (2-4 octobre 1986), Roma, 1988, pp 335-358. History It was produced in Rome for Odoardo Farnese, with a notable preparatory drawing for the upper part of the painting is now in the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Lille. In the background Annibale places a view of the St Peter's Basilica, then still incomplete and without the dome of the Cappella Clementina, probably as a prophecy of England's return to Catholicism. Odoardo's praying pose is argued to be an influence on that Bernini's sculpture of cardinal Roberto Bellarmino. Tomaso Montanari, Il Barocco, Torino, 2012, p. 64. Dating Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence. Giulio Romano, Deesis with Saint Paul and Saint Catherine, 1520 ca., Galleria nazionale, Parma Its dating is the object of much critical dispute, depending on various interpretations of its significance. Some argue it was an expression of Odoardo's campaign to be granted the throne of England, then in the balance as Elizabeth I approached her death without a named successor. This was based on his descent from the House of Lancaster via his mother Maria d'Aviz of Portugal \\\\- it is Odoardo's namesake the English king Edward the Confessor who is shown presenting him to Christ. In the centre background is a figure on all fours, probably referring to a passage in Edward the Confessor's hagiography in which he healed a cripple and thus became the patron saint of cripples. Odoardo's father Alexander Farnese was nephew to Philip II of Spain, who had a particular devotion to another royal saint, Hermenegild, shown in the bottom register opposite Edward. His presence alludes to the House of Farnese's family links to the House of Habsburg, further legitimising Odoardo's dynastic claims via Philip, who had been married to Elizabeth's half-sister Mary I. Supporters of this theory argue that the work must pre- date the final demise of Odoardo's campaign in the early 1600s and that - combined with its style - this places it between 1597 and 1598. Another theory holds that the work was produced to celebrate Odoardo's appointment as \\"cardinal protector\\" of the kingdom of England in February 1600, which would place it in or just after that year. Silvia Ginzburg, in Annibale Carracci, Catalogo della mostra Bologna e Roma 2006-2007, Milano, 2006, p. 350. Destination The painting's original destination is also heavily debated. It was definitely at Odoardo's chapel at the Eremo di Camaldoli at some point, but it is unclear whether this had always been the work's intended destination or whether it was only placed there later. For those arguing that the work relates to Odoardo's royal ambitions, the work was sent to Camaldoli some time after its completion, probably after his hopes of becoming King of England had been dashed, making it embarrassing to still have the painting on display in Rome and preferable to hide it away off the beaten track. Those backing the cardinal protector theory, however, argue from the presence of Mary Magdalene to the left of Ermenegild that it was commissioned expressly for the Farnese chapel at the Eremo - she was that chapel's patron saint. The work's creation seems to be linked to the making of a chasuble and altar frontal (both now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence, but originally in the Eremo di Camaldoli. Silvia Ginzburg, in Annibale Carracci, Catalogo della mostra Bologna e Roma 2006-2007, Milano, 2006, p. 352. Both the chasuble and frontal include the Farnese symbols of lilies and unicorns and were previously misattributed to Francesco Salviati or Perin del Vaga, artists who had worked for the family decades earlier. Annibale not only produced the drawings for the two works but also painted them onto the fabric, rather than the more usual route of giving his drawings to embroiderers.Ginzburg, op. cit., p. 352 Stylistic similarities to the painting and their inclusion of Edward and Ermenegild confirm Annibale's authorship and argue for them and the painting being part of a single unified commission for the Eremo.  Influences  The composition of the upper part of the painting with Christ between saint Peter and saint John is based on Giulio Romano's Deesis with Saint Paul and Saint Catherine (Galleria nazionale di Parma), which itself derived from a drawing by Raphael. Long misattributed to Raphael himself, Romano's painting would have been seen in Parma by Annibale.Donald Posner, Annibale Carracci: A Study in the reform of Italian Painting around 1590, London, 1971, Vol. II, N. 103, p. 45. The work is also strongly influenced by Correggio, which is argued to support the 1597-1598 dating, since at that time that influence had not yet been eclipsed by Roman artists in Annibale's work. However, some art historians argue that he did not totally abandon influences from Correggio and northern Italy in general after that date and so the work can still be dated slightly later. Some even argue that Mary Magdalene's face is based on that of a classical statue of Niobe from the famous Niobids group owned by the Medici in Rome, where Annibale probably saw them, before later being moved to the UffiziAidan Weston-Lewis, Annibale Carracci and the antique, in Master Drawings, XXX, 1992, p. 293. \\\\- a drawing of that statue in his hand survives and features in several of his other paintings.

This film was part of Max Fleischer's Color Classics series. The film follows the story of a boy who has a dream about being on a real train (and learns a lesson about train safety).  Plot  In the back yard, a little boy dressed like an engineer is reading a book about trains while at the same time playing with a toy train. He has a brief thought about what it would be like to operate a real train, and at that moment, he hears a real freight train approaching. He opens the gate to see the train stop, but his dog Rover grabs him before he can get far. Still wanting to get a hands-on experience, the boy attaches Rover's collar to a nearby tree. He then makes his way toward the train and climbs on board the boxcar at the end. Rover frantically tries to get free of the rope, fully aware of the dangers at hand. As the train starts moving, the boy ends up falling off, knocking his head against the rails and sending him into Dreamland. Upon entering the subconscious, the boy finds himself in an enormous train yard packed with odd- looking steam engines. Excited, he looks around and boards a shiny blue streamlined engine. He then hops in the engine's seat, pulls the brake lever backwards, and starts fiddling with the rest of the valves and levers. The engine starts moving, slowly at first, then at rapid speed. Suddenly, the gauges on the dashboard start scolding the boy to \\"play safe\\". Frightened, the boy reaches for the levers, but they all disappear before he can grab them. With no way of stopping the train now, the boy finds himself trapped on the runaway train, which passes along the tracks leading around treacherous mountains and into a cavernous tunnel. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, a red streamliner accelerating just as fast as the blue one appears on the same track, headed in the opposite direction. The two engines blow their whistles at one another, regardless of the inevitable collision course. Both trains scream when they meet face to face. However, the boy is still not fully awake, and Rover hears another train coming down the tracks. Rover finally manages to break free from his collar, and the dog rushes to the boy's rescue. As the train speedily approaches the boy laying on the tracks, Rover finally manages to outrun the locomotive. The dog dips his tail in some red paint and waves it like a flag, hoping to stop the oncoming train. Alas, the engineer doesn't notice, and the engine runs into Rover, sending the dog speeding along the tracks toward the boy. Rover grabs the boy in his teeth and pulls him out of danger, just as the train speeds right past. Once the train has gone, Rover licks the boy's face to wake him up. The boy happily hugs and kisses the dog.

It was their sixth season in Nationalliga A the top flight of Swiss football following their promotion from the Nationalliga B in the season 1945‚Äì46. Basel played their home games in the Landhof, in the Quarter Kleinbasel. Jules D√ºblin was the club's chairman for the sixth successive season.  Overview  Ernst Hufschmid, who had functioned as player-coach the previous four seasons, continued as team manager this season. Basel played a total of 42 games in this season. Of these 26 games were in the domestic league, five games were in the Swiss Cup and eleven were test games. The test games resulted with four victories, two were drawn and five ended with defeats. In total, including the test games and the cup competition, they won 22 games, drew five and lost 15 times. In the 42 games they scored 123 and conceded 87 goals. The newly built stadium Landhof was opened on the weekend of 18 and 19 August 1951. There were larger spectator stands, new meeting rooms, changing rooms and a brand new restaurant. The buildings had cost 700,000 Swiss Francs and had taken two years to complete, during this time the team had to play all their games at the Stadion Sch√ºtzenmatte. The pitch had been newly laid out and its opening was accompanied by a two-day international football tournament, competed by Austrian team First Vienna, French team Sochaux-Montb√©liard and Swiss teams Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich. On both days there were over six thousand people celebrating the big party, even though their team lost 2‚Äì3 against Vienna and even 1‚Äì7 against Sochaux. It was a big hope that these new conditions would also change the fortunes of the club to the better, because nearly 60 years had passed since the club's foundation without a championship. The Basel fans were becoming frustrated, because 36 of the first 52 championships had gone to the cities of Z√ºrich, Geneva or Bern. Even small towns such as Aarau, Neuch√¢tel, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Lugano, Bellinzona, Biel/Bienne, Winterthur and St. Gallen had been able to celebrate a championship. The championship had still had never been won by a team from Basel. As in the previous seasons, there were fourteen teams contesting in the 1951‚Äì52 Nationalliga A and the bottom two teams in the league table were to be relegated. Basel played a good start to the season. They won the first six games straight off. But they lost four of the next five games and slipped in the league table. However, winning the last three games before and the first three games after the winter break, they were again in contention for the league championship. Suddenly, towards the end of the season, they lost five games in a row and lost contact to the table top. At the end of the season Basel finished in fourth position, seven points behind the new champions Grasshopper Club. The hopeful fans were again frustrated by this fact. The team Basel had won 14 games, drew three games and were defeated nine times. The team scored 68 goals and conceded 47 as they obtained their 31 points. Josef \\"Seppe\\" H√ºgi was team's and the league's best goal scorer with 24 league goals. Walter Bannwart was the team's second-best goal getter with 10 goals. Paul St√∂cklin scored nine times, Ren√© Bader and Hans H√ºgi both scored seven times. Basel started in the 3rd principal round of the Swiss Cup on 4 November 1951 with a home game against lower tier Wettingen and won 7‚Äì0. In the next round against Nationalliga A team Locarno they won 3‚Äì2 and again in the following round against Nationalliga A team Chiasso by three goals to one. In the quarter finals Basel beat Servette and faced Grasshopper Club in the semi- final. The Grasshoppers won this game in the Landhof and progressed to the final, in which they beat Lugano and thus won the double.  Players  The following is the list of the Basel first team squad during the season 1950‚Äì51. The list includes players that were in the squad on the day that the Nationalliga A season started on 3 September 1950 but subsequently left the club after that date. ;Players who left the squad  Results = Legend  Friendly matches  Pre-season = Winter break and mid-season  Nationalliga A  League matches = League standings Swiss Cup=See also * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons  References  Sources  * Die ersten 125 Jahre.

It is based on the first novel of a trilogy by Blanka Lipi≈Ñska. The plot follows a young woman from Warsaw in a spiritless relationship falling for a dominant Sicilian man, who imprisons her and imposes on her a period of 365 days in which to fall in love with him. It stars Michele Morrone as Don Massimo Torricelli and Anna-Maria Sieklucka as Laura Biel. The film was released theatrically in Poland on 7 February 2020 and was later made available on Netflix on 7 June 2020, quickly gaining global attention. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, who heavily criticized its softcore themes and sexual violence. Plot After a meeting between the Torricelli Sicilian Mafia crime family and black market dealers, Massimo Torricelli watches a beautiful woman on a beach. His father, leader of the Sicilian Mafia family, is shot dead. Five years later, Massimo is now the leader of the Torricelli crime family. In Warsaw, Laura Biel, a fiery executive, is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Martin. Laura celebrates her 29th birthday in Italy but after Martin embarrasses her, she goes for a walk and runs into Massimo, who kidnaps her. At his villa, Massimo reveals to Laura that she was the woman at the beach five years ago and that when he was injured, all he could think about was her. After searching for years and finally spotting her, he had to have her and intends to keep her as a prisoner for 365 days until she falls in love with him. He also promises her that he will not touch her without her consent. When she tries to escape, he does not let her leave. As they spend time together, Laura teases him and then refuses to have sex with him. However, she slowly starts to get him to open up about his personal life. At a hotel in Rome, she teases him again and he cuffs her to the bed. She is forced to watch Massimo receive oral sex from another woman. Afterward, she appears to want to give in. However, he stops, releases her, and orders her to get dressed for a club. At the club, Laura flaunts herself for Massimo and his friends, angering him. When she begins to flirt with a man from the rival mafia family, the man gropes her against her will. Massimo and the others draw their weapons while Laura is taken out of the club. The following morning, she awakens on a yacht to Massimo and his fellow mafioso, Mario, arguing. During the night, Massimo shot the man's hand who had groped Laura, inciting a mafia war between the two families. Laura attempts to apologize, but Massimo blames her for the incident. As they argue, Laura falls into the water and starts to panic. Massimo jumps in to save her. When she awakens, he admits he was scared she might not make it and does not want to lose her. They make love on the yacht. Massimo allows Laura to visit her family in Warsaw. He tells her he loves her and will join her after finishing up business. In Warsaw, Laura waits for Massimo for days with no contact. She reconnects with Olga and they go clubbing. She runs into Martin, who says he has been looking for her to apologize. He attempts to convince her to reconcile and follows her back to her apartment, where Massimo is unexpectedly waiting. While having sex, she opens his shirt to see wounds from the mafia war. She confesses to him that she loves him. The following morning, Massimo proposes and she accepts. However, she asks him to keep his \\"occupation\\" a secret from her parents. Back in Italy, Mario informs Massimo of rising tensions. Laura mentions feeling unwell but brushes off seeing a doctor. They discuss their upcoming wedding that her family is not allowed to attend, as she does not want them to discover what Massimo does. However, Massimo allows Olga to come as Laura's bridesmaid. When Olga visits, Laura reveals she is pregnant. Olga urges her to tell Massimo about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Mario receives a phone call from a Torricelli informant that the rival mafia family is about to kill Laura. Laura's car enters a tunnel but does not come out the other side. Mario rushes to find Massimo just as Laura's call drops. Realizing the implications, Massimo breaks down, as a police car blares at the entrance of the tunnel.

As of August 16, it gained 40,000 signatures. On July 2, 2020, singer Duffy wrote an open letter, addressing Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, criticizing the film for glamorizing sexual violence. \\"This should not be anyone‚Äôs idea of entertainment, nor should it be described as such, or be commercialized in this manner\\", she said. After this, another Change.org petition, initiated by social media influencer Mikayla Zazon, gained over 70,000 signatures. On July 8, 2020, PTC president Timothy F. Winter requested Netflix to remove the film from the platform. Sequel Plans have been made to work on a sequel, but have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He lived with a problem till he 'saw' the solution. This enabled him to understand the essence of some fundamental problems but also made it difficult for others to understand his work. His work could in general not be explained by discursive reasoning; one had to make an effort to share his intuitive thinking.\\" In the ceremony, Millikan also noted that \\"Saul Kaplun's work played a decisive role in the development of applied mathematics at the California Institute.\\" Caltech President Lee Alvin DuBridge eulogized at the same ceremony, \\"Saul Kaplun had a brilliant analytical and creative mind and made many profound and original contributions to the theory of fluid mechanics. He was an applied mathematician of extraordinary ability and had already won wide and admiring recognition for his work.\\" Publications Dr. Millikan stated at the 1964 Caltech ceremony, \\"Few publications bear his name as author‚Ä¶ however, in very many publications by others the author expresses his thanks to Saul Kaplun for having contributed some fundamental ideas to the work, or states that he has used methods due to Kaplun. By now his work has won world-wide recognition among specialists.\\" After Kaplun's untimely death, his published papers and much of his unpublished work were edited by his former PhD advisor, Lagerstrom, and by Louis Norberg Howard of MIT and Ching-shi Liu of Caltech and were published in 1967 in book form under the title Fluid Mechanics and Singular Perturbation, a Collection of Papers by Saul Kaplun. Kaplun's work has been cited and extolled by colleagues and authors in the field. Robert Edmund O'Malley wrote, \\"The work of Kaplun and Lagerstrom at Caltech in the 1950s was especially important to the development of matched expansions and its applications to fluid mechanics.\\" Sunil Datta wrote, \\"Singular perturbation method‚Ä¶ It was left to the genius of Saul Kaplun (1957) to recognize the analogy between the theory of flow at small Reynolds number and boundary layer theory and to apply to it the singular perturbation method.\\" Articles *with P.

Life  Paul de Wailly grew up in Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle in Abbeville. He lost his father, a naval officer, when he was seven. He started composing at the age of 17 and became a student of C√©sar Franck at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1900, he married Marthe de Maricourt (1870-1918). At the beginning of the 20th century, de Wailly held regular concerts at Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle. During the First World War, he took over the administration of the Abbeville Hospital. In 1921, along with Albert Laurent (1885-1978), he founded the \\"Society of Friends of Music\\" in Abbeville to present lectures and organize concerts. De Wailly created orchestral works (including several symphonies), chamber music (including a piano quintet in F minor, op. 15 from 1895), organ works, and vocal compositions. The majority of his compositions display characteristics of the late romantic tradition of C√©sar Franck. Firmly devoted to absolute music in the classical style, he opposed contemporary trends at the beginning of the 20th century. However, he still maintained friendships with modern composers, including Erik Satie, who he supported for a time. Most of de Wailly's works were composed between 1870-1900 and published in Paris between 1892 and 1930. However, on the eve of the World War I, his oratorio, L'Ap√¥tre (The Apostle), was performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elysees on December 19, 23 and 28, 1924, but public reception was lukewarm. With the exception of performances at the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique (National Music Society), de Wailly's music did not achieve great success outside appreciation outside a small circle of friends.Garros, Madeleine.

He held the post of Governor of Londonderry and Culmore from 1611 until his death; he was also twice MP for County Donegal. Life Relatively little is known of Vaughan's background. He came to Ireland in 1599 as a company commander with Henry Docwra and was granted land in County Donegal. There were family links between many of the early planters and it has been suggested that Vaughan was a relative of Docwra's wife; she was a granddaughter of the MP John Vaughan of Sutton, and descendant of a Breconshire gentry family, the Vaughans of Porthaml.Heraldic evidence also suggests Vaughan was from the Porthaml, Breconshire family; see \\"Sir John Vaughan\\", Notes & Queries, no 73 (Mar 22 1851), p.223 Vaughan was a survivor of the 1608 sack of Derry during O'Doherty's rebellion. He was made military governor of the town in 1611, repairing the fortifications originally built by Docwra, and was knighted in 1615. He also served as the town's mayor twice, and has been described as \\"the most outstanding figure in Derry for thirty-five years [...] a permanent element in the government of the town\\". As governor he was responsible for building many of the town's significant structures, notably Derry city walls and St Columb's Cathedral, completed under his supervision in 1633.

Biography Betty Kirby-Greene was born in Thurlestone, Devon in 1906. Kirby-Green was adventurous. She ran away from school and joined a dance troupe on the stage. She left that to start running social clubs. One was the Hay Hill Social Club. She was also the proprietor of the Braycourt Hotel in Bray, near Maidenhead. Kirby-Green was a skier and racing motorist before she discovered flying when she took a passenger flight in a de Havilland Gypsy Moth. That flight was from Heston, delivering papers during the 1926 General Strike. She determined to learn to fly and by 1937 she achieved her 'A' Pilots Licence. She was challenged to fly from London to Paris alone within two weeks of gaining her licence. Kirby-Green flew from the Heston aerodrome where she had previously been permitted to fly up to 3 miles. The bet was for ¬£100 and was made by a member of the Hay Hill Club. Kirby- Green hired a Moth and flew to Le Bourget. Kirby-Green went on to get her 'B' Licence. She used a borrowed Klemm KL.3 aircraft to fly. Kirby-Green met the aviator A. E. Clouston. He was intent on setting a new aviation record. Together they rented a de Havilland DH.88 'Comet' racer G-ACSS. The plane was called the Grosvenor House. C. W. A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black used it to win the MacRoberston Air Race in 1934. The costs of the record attempt caused Houston and Kirby-Green to need to fund raise significantly. Kirby-Green was near bankruptcy as the flight was arranged, the discharge being held over until the record attempt had been completed. The cost of the flight to Kirby- Green was given as ¬£1176. Burberry Ltd sponsored the pair and the plane was repainted beige and re-titled 'The Burberry'. On the 14th November 1937 they left Croydon aerodrome and completed the journey to Cairo in 11 hours four minutes. They beat the existing record by 30 minutes. The couple continued the flight to Cape Town overturning the record held by Amy Johnson. They had arrived more than 33 hours ahead of the previous record, in a time of 45 hours two minutes. The plane is preserved in the Shuttleworth Collection. She later planned record flights to Australia with Scott. In 2016 Burberry created a short film entitled The Tale of Thomas Burberry which featured Lily James in a role inspired by Kirby-Green. Personal life Kirby-Green married John Kirby-Green in 1929, however the marriage didn't last. Kirby-Green married George Heycock in 1938. He was promoted to the rank of Air Commodore after serving as a fighter pilot during World War II. Heycock was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942. He went on to become Air Attach√© in Washington and Paris. They retired to Pytchley Hall in Northamptonshire in 1948. Heycock died in 1988. Kirby-Green died in 1992.

Suiter is a geologist whose professional career has spanned teaching, working the oil and gas industry and public services. In her leadership roles at both the American Geosciences Institute and the National Science Foundation, Suiter has worked over decades to increase the ethnic diversity of the geosciences.  Background  Suiter started her undergraduate studies at Franklin & Marshall College as a Physics major and switched to geosciences because she found the interdisciplinary nature of geology more challenging and satisfying. After earning her BS degree, Suiter taught sciences for grades 5-12 in the Philadelphia public school system (1970-1977). She worked for the United States Geological Survey for four years before starting her MS studies at Wesleyan University. After earning her MS in earth science in 1981, Suiter worked in the oil and gas industry for Cities Service Oil and Gas in the early 1980s. During the oil price crash of the mid 1980s, Suiter decided to leave the oil and gas industry. From 1987-1997, Suiter held several positions within the American Geosciences Institute, including director of Special Education Programs, director of Education and Human Resources, and director of Human Resources and Career Development. At the American Geosciences Institute, Suiter also led the Minority Participation Program, which was created to address the lack of ethnic diversity in the geosciences and which awards scholarships to under-represented American geoscience students every year. Since Suiter started working for the National Science Foundation in 1998, she has led several programs within NSF that foster geosciences education and diversity. Suiter currently serves as a program director in NSF's Division of Human Resource Development.  Service to the Discipline of Geosciences  Over her career, Suiter has served on numerous committees and panels of the Association for Women Geoscientists, the American Geosciences Institute, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, the National Science Foundation, the American Institute of Physics, the Association for Women in Science, the National Science Teaching Association, the National Association of Black Geologists and Geophysicists, and the American Educational Research Association.

The power seizure usually culminated in the establishment of local revolutionary committees, which replaced the original governments as well as communist party branches, and wielded enormous power that often caused much chaos in the Chinese society.  Brief history  Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution in May 1966. In January 1967, the January Storm in Shanghai marked the beginning of power-seizure movement, which then spread to other areas of China. The rebel groups across China, such as those in Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou and Shandong, started their own seizure of power as early as late January. The Cultural Revolution thereafter entered a new phase. The end product of the power seizure were the revolutionary committees, which were established to wield the power grabbed from local governments and communist party committees. The revolutionary committees possessed enormous and highly centralized power. However, conflicts and power struggle within the revolutionary committees and the rebel groups often occurred, which resulted in nationwide violent struggles and the persecution of a large number of people. After the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committees were gradually abandoned during the Boluan Fanzheng and \\"Reforms and Opening-up\\" period.

History Construction began on September 16, 1968, on a $3-million Sears with two above-ground levels and a basement. The store welcomed its first shoppers in February, 1970. The single-level wing of specialty stores opened, with thirty-four initial stores, on March 5, 1970. The architect for both was Burke, Kober, Nicolais & Archuleta. S. H. Kress & Co. five-and-dime, Harris & Frank and Silverwoods were among the junior department stores at the mall's launch. In total the mall sat on a lot of 45 acres. Alongside the mall existed Disco Fair, which later rebranded as Two Guys and FedMart in the 1970's and Target in 1983. A 2-level, May Company California was the final original anchor to open on November 2, 1970 and was rebranded Robinsons-May in 1993. The 2-story emporium was designed by Pasadena architects Ladd and Kelsey. In 1999, the anchors Robinsons-May and Sears moved from Esplanade to the Buenaventura Mall in Ventura. Demolition The enclosed mall was demolished in August 2000. The enclosed mall was replaced by an entirely open-air center, known as Esplanade Center, the first stores opening in September 2001. These included Cost Plus World Market and Bed Bath & Beyond. A 136,000-square-foot Home Depot opened later in February 2002.

In 1872 a chapel was opened over the coach house at Pelham House on Scott Lane. Partly owing to Irish immigration the congregation grew and a decision was taken to build a new church on Westgate. The foundation stone for the new church was laid in 1881 on land donated by Mr Joseph Hirst and it was completed in 1882 at a cost of ¬£1,200. The original church now stands as the church hall. In 1986 the church was extended with a new larger church opening in an adjoing extension to the East of the original church and the existing church was to serve as a church hall. The church was run by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate however they left the area in 1990 and the church fell into the juridiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds.

Incident The murders that Nathaniel Woods was convicted of took place on June 17, 2004, in Birmingham, Alabama. Three police officers unexpectedly came into the home of Nathaniel Woods and Kerry Spencer due to their home being a suspected drug house. Spencer had an SKS rifle when he heard the officers, while Woods was in the kitchen. Spencer came downstairs to see two officers pointing guns at him. Spencer fired shots at all three police officers, leading to their deaths. Woods ran out of the house when he heard the gunshots. Spencer and Woods were both charged with the murders, despite Woods never firing a weapon. Spencer stated Woods was not involved and said, \\"Nate is absolutely innocent. That man didn't know I was going to shoot anybody just like I didn't know I was going to shoot anybody that day, period.\\" Trial At Woods's trial, prosecutors successfully excluded every qualified Black prospective juror, except for two, in a city that is majority Black. In deciding whether capital punishment was an appropriate sentence for Woods's convinction, the jury voted 10-2 in favor of execution. Unlike most states that allow capital punishment, Alabama does not require death sentence verdicts to be unanimous, and Woods was placed on death row. Controversy Days before Woods's execution, controversy started regarding Woods's sentence and whether he was genuinely guilty of the murders he was convicted of. Certain civil rights leaders, including Shaun King and Martin Luther King III, urged Alabama governor Kay Ivey to commute his death sentence.

The song was released on his 1985 album Downtown. Originally written as an instrumental titled \\"Bruce Is King,\\" the song features lyrics inspired by the B.B. King album Blues Is King. Though not released commercially, the song appeared on a 1985 promotional single. The song has since seen positive critical reception, though Crenshaw has expressed disappointment with the song's lyrics. Background \\"Blues Is King\\" originated as an instrumental titled \\"Bruce Is King\\" (named in reference to musician Bruce Springsteen). Crenshaw made this original demo playing Mosrite guitars. \\"Bruce Is King\\" was later released on the rarities album The 9 Volt Years. Crenshaw recalled struggling to come up with lyrics for the song; he explained, \\"I was really struggling to come up with an idea. I thought of this old B.B. King album title, Blues Is King. I made that the title of the song.\\" Crenshaw attempted to keep the lyrics \\"deliberately ambiguous, where I said it doesn't matter, let's just make these sounds and it'll come out all right.\\" The song was produced by Mitch Easter and Crenshaw, making it the only song on Downtown not produced by T Bone Burnett. Release \\"Blues Is King\\" was released as the third track on Crenshaw's third album, Downtown, in 1985. Though it was not released commercially as a single, a promotional single with the song on both sides was released that same year to DJs. The song has also appeared on the compilation This Is Easy: The Best of Marshall Crenshaw. Reception Joe Sasfy of The Washington Post described the song as \\"vintage Crenshaw.\\" Scott Bernarde of Sun-Sentinel wrote, \\"Crenshaw, the '80s king of '50s and '60s reverb and twang, puts those effects to good use\\" on the song. Crenshaw has mixed feelings about the song, praising its music but expressing dislike for its lyrics. He explained, \\"I was never 100 percent happy with the lyrics, but I always thought the music was really beautiful, and that the track was nice, too.\\" Crenshaw does not perform the song live often; he said in 1991, \\"I can't sing that song now because it's a joke to me.

She created the web series Chicken Shop Date, in which she interviews rappers and grime artists in fried chicken restaurants. She is known for her use of sarcasm, deadpan humour and awkward silences in her interviews. Dimoldenberg has also written for The Guardian and Vogue, and made documentaries for Vice Media and Channel 4. She has appeared on the television programmes The Big Narstie Show, Don't Hate the Playaz and Celebrity Come Dine With Me. In September 2019, Dimoldenberg was named the 77th biggest influencer in the UK by The Sunday Times. In October of the same year, the Evening Standard included her in its Progress 1000, a list of \\"London's most influential people\\". Biography=Early life Dimoldenberg grew up in Marylebone in the City of Westminster. Her father is Paul Dimoldenberg, a Labour Party member of Westminster City Council. She studied A-levels in English, art, politics and IT, and went on to obtain a Foundation Diploma in Art and Design and a BA in Fashion Communication from Central Saint Martins, London. Of her time at university, she has written, \\"I was always on the outskirts of the ultra-fashionable scene and left the party- going to those who had the stamina, and the invite\\". Chicken Shop Date Chicken Shop Date began as a humorous column written by Dimoldenberg for the youth magazine The Cut, which was based at the Stowe Centre, a youth club on Harrow Road, London. It was other members' interest in grime that led her to interview grime artists, as she \\"wanted to know more about the music\\"; she began by interviewing \\"friends of friends\\". Dimoldenberg had the idea to frame the interviews as dates, and the location of a chicken shop was chosen as it was \\"somewhere you wouldn‚Äôt usually go on a date\\". The first filmed episode was released in 2014 ‚Äì it featured a \\"date\\" with the grime MC Ghetts. The show has since featured Sean Paul, Daniel Kaluuya, Dave, AJ Tracey and Big Narstie, among others. The filming of each episode takes around 40 minutes; finished episodes last at most five. Dimoldenberg has described her persona in the show as \\"an exaggerated version of myself\\" adding that \\"[i]n the edit is where the character comes through, we chop and cut things, we make it more awkward\\". While noting that Chicken Shop Date is \\"not as popular\\" as American interview formats like Hot Ones, Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis and Carpool Karaoke, Jonah Engel Bromwich of The New York Times has described it as \\"notable for the way in which it has grown through tapping into a specific subculture\\", writing that \\"[c]apturing an audience of music enthusiasts has given the show credibility\\". Television In 2018 Dimoldenberg presented the Channel 4 documentary Meet the Markles, in which she travelled to the United States to meet members of Meghan Markle's family; The Telegraph called it \\"an entertaining ride [...] slicked by moments of real hilarity\\" and the Evening Standard described it as an \\"instant hit\\". However, the Metro JJ Nattrass wrote that \\"many viewers at home didn‚Äôt quite get what the show or its host were aiming for, and were left feeling confused\\", but conceded that \\"there were also plenty of viewers who genuinely enjoyed the satirical skew of the programme\\". The same year, she appeared in an episode of The Big Narstie Show alongside David Haye, Rachel Parris and Krept and Konan. In October 2018, she appeared in the first series of the ITV2 hip hop-themed comedy show Don't Hate the Playaz as a \\"roving reporter\\". The programme was nominated for a Royal Television Society Award in the Entertainment category. Dimoldenberg did not appear in the second series, which aired in autumn 2019.

Bunn spent over 16 years in prison and nearly 12 on parole and before he was exonerated in 2018. After his release, Bunn founded a nonprofit that aims to educate incarcerated youth and provide access to books to promote literacy. Early life Bunn grew up in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He and his younger sister were raised by his mother. Murder conviction On August 14, 1991, two Rikers Island corrections officers were shot in their car during a robbery in the Kingsbourough Housing project; one died. The surviving officer, Robert Crosson, stated that the shooters were two light-skinned black men in their twenties. Louis N. Scarcella, an NYPD detective later discovered to serially falsify evidence, arrested Bunn and 17-year-old Rosean Hargrave on an anonymous tip the following day, although both boys did not fit the physical descriptions provided by Crosson. Crosson subsequently identified the two as the shooters in a lineup. In November 1992, a jury convicted both of second-degree murder. Life in prison Bunn was initially held in a juvenile facility in upstate New York. He did not receive a comprehensive education, and had to teach himself, earning his GED at 17. At 17, he was transferred to Elmira Correctional Facility. Bunn was paroled in 2006 for good behavior, but still fought to clear his conviction. Exoneration In 2013, evidence of extensive misconduct by Detective Scarcella came to light, triggering a number of motions from defendants previously accused by him of crimes for retrial. In April 2015, Justice ShawnDyna Simpson vacated the conviction of Rosean Hargrave, based on the \\"false and misleading practices\\" of Scarcella. Judge Simpson similarly vacated Bunn's conviction and ordered a retrial in November 2016, noting that evidence that could have been used to identify perpetrators‚Äînamely, the blood on the outside of the police car‚Äîhad been destroyed by police. After an appeals court upheld Simpson's ruling in April 2018, the prosecution dismissed charges against Bunn in May.

This was the first aircraft of any type to carry a solo pilot around the world. In 2002 pilot Steve Fossett flew the Spirit of Freedom on the first successful nonstop solo circumnavigation flight. Personal life Steve Fossett & Spirit-of Freedom gondola Born Timothy Scot Cole on November 11, 1945 in Sarasota, Florida. Became a lifelong Colorado resident after moving there at age 15, he lives in Greeley, Colorado with his wife Vikki. They have twin children Timothy and Elizabeth. Cole started as an aviator by enlisting in the US Army where he was an honor graduate at helicopter flight training. He has over 1500 flying hours in rotary winged aircraft. From 1968 to 1969, he flew helicopters in combat during the Vietnam war, later becoming an instructor. Cole's first hot air balloon solo was in July 1978 at Frederick, Colorado. He has flown over 1000 hours in hot air, helium, and ammonia gas balloons. Cole's FAA commercial pilot unrestricted Lighter than Air certificate is complemented by his inspector/repairman expertise with a FAA airframe and power plant (A&P;) certification. Tim Cole with John Kugler and Dennis Brown pioneered balloon design using the inexpensive, agricultural gas anhydrous ammonia. This lifting gas is an economical alternative to helium. Ammonia is sometimes used to fill weather balloons with about half the lifting power of hydrogen. Due to ammonia's high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast). From Greeley, Colorado, Cole made a world-record solo duration flight in an ammonia gas balloon on September 26, 1991; the National Aeronautics Association declared it one of ten most important flights that year. In 1993, Steve Fossett reached out to Tim Cole for balloon flying lessons. The following year in August 1994, Cole copiloted Fossett's first major balloon flight across the Atlantic Ocean. They launched from Canada and landed in Hamburg, Germany on August 21, flying over 75 hours and 4351 km (2703 sm). At that time, no manned balloon had ever flown more than 6 days or 5000 miles.National Aviation Hall of Fame He was on the team for Fossett\\"s around the world attempts in 1997 and 1998. Tim Cole designed and built the Spirit of Freedom capsule and was the Project Director of the Spirit of Freedom flight in 2002. The Spirit of Freedom was the first aircraft of any type to carry a solo pilot around the world. In 2002 pilot Steve Fossett flew the Spirit of Freedom on the first successful nonstop solo circumnavigation flight. On March 23, 2004, Cole was the flight director for David Hempleman-Adams during his balloon world altitude record of 43,000 feet, breaking Per Lindstrand's record set in November 1996. Tim Cole was the flight director for the project Two Eagles Across the Pacific by Balloon for pilots Troy Bradley and Leonid Tiukhtyaev. Cole supervised system operational readiness, improvements, and design changes. On January 31, 2015, the Two Eagles flight surpassed the gas balloon records for distance set by the Double Eagle V and duration set by the Double Eagle II. The Two Eagles' distance was and the Two Eagles balloon stayed aloft for 160 hours, 38 minutes (6 days, 16 hours, 38 minutes). In 1995, he was awarded the \\"Diplome Montgolfier,\\" ballooning's highest honor, by the Balloon Federation of America and the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). Cole holds two world and 26 national ballooning records and was inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame. In May 2020, he helped train his son Tim Jr. who gained his FAA private pilot Lighter than Air certificate. Spirit of Freedom Capsule Designed and build by Tim Cole out of kevlar and carbon with a clear bubble hatch. His local Greeley partners helped with materials and building including: Agland, Purdy-Minch Construction and Maxanns. About the size of a closet, the Spirit-of-Freedom capsule has a bench and a sleeping bag. Fossett averaged 4 hours of sleep per day in 45 minute naps. He ate military rations called MREs which were heated with water activated chemical heat packs. Fossett would have to regularly climb out into the sub-zero temperatures to change fuel tanks. Besides the Comstock autopilot, the gondola equipment included GPS, Inmarsat, and satellite phone backup for communications with Mission Control at Washington University in St. Louis. Fossett used radios for communications with air traffic control and other aircraft. An Emergency Position Indicating Rescue Beacon (EPIRB) was on board to aid search and rescue. The unpressurized gondola used lithium batteries to power the electronic equipment and a custom heater regulating the aircraft internal temperature between 4 and 21 C (38-72 F). The Spirit of Freedom Capsule was displayed for some time under the Spirit of St. Louis in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.

Buffy Sainte-Marie performing in Sandvik in 1966. Helsinki Folk Festival was a festival arranged during the Pentecost of 1966 (29‚Äì30 May) in Sandvik, Espoo, Finland. It was the first ever festival of popular music in Finland, and apparently a one-off event. The first Pori Jazz festival was arranged the same year, but only in the summer. The first Ruisrock was arranged only four years later. One of the organizers of the festival was Juhani ‚ÄúJussi‚Äù Joutsenniemi, who together with his band the Hootenanny Trio had been touring the folk festivals in England together with another band, the Guldgurkorna, and with Anki Lindqvist. He thought that something similar should be arranged in Finland, too. Joutsenniemi had for some time already been arranging folk music club events in e.g. Munkkiniemi. At the Munkkiniemi secondary school there were people who were eager to arrange various events, and they helped organize the event. The person who came up with the location of the festival was Sinikka Sokka, who at the time courted a young man whose father had rented the Sandvik fishermen‚Äôs village as their summer residence. Sokka thought the place would be an ideal one for the festival. Sokka‚Äôs own group, Sinkat, would be among the performers. Hootenanny Trio performing in Sandvik in 1966. Modern maps no longer show the location of Sandvik, but it is known that it was located somewere where Soukka meets Espoonlahti, around the current Ristiniementie street. There were no structures there such as stage with a roof or places for the audience to sit. Members of the audience spent the night in some small houses in the area. Transportation to the site was arranged by special buses from the Kampintori square in Helsinki. Hector performing in Sandvik in 1966. The top of the bill was occupied by the American-Canadian singer Buffy Sainte-Marie. Her fee and expenses were paid for by Yle, who also recorded the event. For some reason, Yle did not arrange transportation for Sainte-Marie from the airport, so the task fell on Timo Pakkanen, known for performing as Santa Claus. Sainte-Marie was then known for her hit ‚ÄúUniversal Soldier‚Äù, the translation of which had been released earlier that year by the Finnish young rising star Hector with the title ‚ÄúPalkkasoturi‚Äù (‚Äòmercenary‚Äô). His version had flown to the top of the Finnish charts. Sainte-Marie knew about this version and mentioned it while speaking to the audience.

Joutsenniemi remembers the event in the following: The weather was favourable in that it did not rain. However, the temperature was less than ten degrees. Not only gigs were played at the festival.

He is the leader of the Leviathan Movement.  Early life  He was born in 1982 in Belgrade, and is a member of an influential Serbian-Jewish family. According to the official documents, his grandfather, Pavle Bihalji was executed by the Gestapo in 1941 during the German occupation of Serbia, however he claims that the communists killed him. He is the grand-nephew of the late Yugoslav, and Serbian academic, Oto Bihalji-Merin. As a child, he played a minor role in a Serbian TV Series, Sreƒáni Ljudi. In 2004, he was a candidate of the Strength of Serbia Movement for the local elections.  Leviathan  In 2015, he founded the Leviathan Movement, an animal right organization. Since then, the organization quickly got attention and it became the largest animal rights organization in ex- Yugoslavia. In 2016, the movement became popular when videos of the members of organization rescuing animals showed up on social media, as well as videos of them offering compensation for information on animal abusers. Initially, the movement only focused on animal rights issues, exposing animal abusers, and taking their animals away from them. However, the movement has shifted from solely being an animal rights group to openly talking about political issues, mainly illegal immigration. In 2020, the organization announced that they will be forming a party that will participate in the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election. The party since then has been described as ultranationalist, neo- fascist and anti-immigration by the media. He received second position on a combined electoral list of the Leviathan, and the \\"I live for Serbia\\" movement for the 2020 election.  Controversies  In 2018, Bihali was arrested for making threats on Facebook. Even after this, he continued threatening people on social media, including minors. In April 2020, members of the movement took the family dog of a Romani family in Dorƒáol away from them claiming that the dog was abused, and that it was used for dog fights, however, this claim was denied by the people living in the neighbourhood. Even though he has Jewish heritage, he has been described as a Neo-Nazi for having the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf tattoo. He has also been criticized for having relations with the mafia after he posted a photo of himself wearing a shirt with the image of Luka Bojoviƒá, a Serbian criminal. He defended himself by saying that the family of Bojoviƒá helped raised him as he didn't have contact with his family for almost 20 years. He also glorifies Milorad Ulemek, who was convicted of the assassinations of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá and former Serbian President Ivan Stamboliƒá.

The center will focus on the presentation and study of chicano art from across the United States. It is a collaborative effort between stand-up comedian, actor, and writer Cheech Marin, who will donate his collection of more than 700 pieces of Chicano art to the City of Riverside, which will provide the facilities to house the collection, and the Riverside Art Museum, which will manage the center. When complete, the center is intended to be a world-class institution to research and study \\"all things [related to] Chicano art\\".  Center location and funding  After a successful exhibit of some of Marin's collection at the Riverside Art Museum in early 2017, the city and museum approached Marin about establishing a permanent home for his collection in Riverside. The idea of keeping the collection intact appealed to Marin. The city's emphasis on history, art and culture, as well as the large Latino population in the area, and the proximity to five universities, were also appealing. With two of the universities, the University of California, Riverside, and California State University, San Bernardino, already offering Chicana/o studies programs, Marin was convinced Riverside was the right location. The center, which Marin has informally dubbed \\"The Cheech\\", will be housed in what is currently the main branch of the city of Riverside's library system, a facility located adjacent to the historic The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa. A new downtown library is currently under construction at another location, and is due to open in the second half of 2020. After the library move is complete, the existing building will undergo a renovation to repurpose the library for the new art museum and academic center. A fundraising campaign, named \\"Reach for the Cheech\\", was started in 2017. After receiving a $600,000 pledge from the Riverside-based Altura Credit Union, the campaign was able to meet its initial fundraising goal of three million dollars on May 29, 2018. Shortly after Altura's commitment, the State of California included in its budget an additional $9.7 million to assist with the development of the center. In December 2019, the Bank of America made a $750,000 commitment, bringing the total raised to almost $14 million.  Museum collection  The initial collection of over 700 works, donated by Cheech Marin, will consist of paintings, drawings, prints, mixed media, sculptures and photography that Marin has assembled over the past 30 years. The collection covers a range of Chicano art types, including rasquachismo, which has been growing in popularity. Marin, who came to fame in the 1970s as part of the comedy duo Cheech & Chong, is noted for having the largest private collection of Chicano art in the world. The Center intends to expand the collection over time. Over 70 artists are represented in the collection, including:  The Cheech film  In 2019 Edward Tyndall directed a film featuring Cheech Marin titled The Cheech: An American Icon's Crusade for the Chicano Art Movement. The film covers Marin's lifelong advocacy for Chicano art, and his efforts to develop The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture and Industry. The original music score was written by El Dusty.

The zone, originally covering six city blocks and a park, was established on June 8, 2020 by George Floyd protesters after the Seattle Police Department (SPD) left its East Precinct building. The zone was cleared of occupants by police on July 1, 2020. The zone's formation in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was preceded by a week of tense interactions between protesters and police in full riot gear that began on June 1 and escalated on June 7, after a man drove his vehicle into the protesters and shot one of them (near 11th Ave. and Pine St.). Tear gas, flash bangs, and pepper spray were repeatedly used by police in the densely populated residential neighborhood. The mayor issued a ban on tear gas on June 5. City, county, and state representatives joined demonstrators on the front lines on June 6, when flash bangs and pepper spray were used on the crowd. On June 7, the SPD reported that the crowd was throwing rocks, bottles, fireworks, and shining green lasers into officers eyes. Near midnight on June 8, tear gas was deployed again, despite the ban. Later that morning, police boarded up and moved out of the East Precinct in an effort to de-escalate the situation. The zone was a self-organizing space without official leadership. The protesters united around three main demands: 1) cut Seattle‚Äôs $409 million police budget by 50 percent, 2) shift funding to community programs and services in historically black communities, and 3) ensure that protesters would not be charged with crimes. Within the first few days of formation, activity in the area rapidly expanded into a number of directions including the arts, music, dialog and resource exchange. Participants created a block- long \\"Black Lives Matter\\" mural, provided free film screenings in the open street, and performed live music. A \\"No Cop Co-op\\" was formed, with food, hand sanitizer, and other supplies. Areas were set up to serve expression of free speech and to facilitate discourse, which included the construction of a community vegetable garden. The zone swiftly became a focus of national attention when President Donald Trump tweeted disapproval, on June 10 and again on June 11, referring to the occupants as \\"ugly Anarchists\\" and demanding that the governor of Washington and the mayor of Seattle \\"take back\\" the zone. Mayor Jenny Durkan described the area on June 11 as four blocks in Seattle with a block party atmosphere, a common occurrence for Capitol Hill, stating, \\"It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta.\\" On June 14, USA Today reported a festive environment, comparing the protest to a miniature version of Burning Man. The New York Times later contrasted Durkan's words with descriptions provided by local businesspeople, reporting \\"encampments overtaking the sidewalks... roving bands of masked protesters smashing windows and looting [and] [y]oung white men wielding guns ... harangu[ing] customers.\\" On June 22 the Star Tribune reported that at night the atmosphere would become charged, as demonstrators marched and armed volunteer guards kept watch. SPD Chief Carmen Best expressed that the department was looking to reduce their footprint, but later clarified that officials aimed to return officers to the precinct, as it was paramount they were able to respond to calls in a timely fashion. On June 12, Black Lives Matter protesters negotiated with local officials to leave the zone. The size of CHOP decreased four days later, when roadblocks were replaced and moved. CHOP continued to shrink in size following shootings in or near the zone on June 20, 21, and 23 when some occupiers left. Durkan responded that the SPD would return peacefully and in the near future. On June 28, she met with protesters and informed them that the city planned to remove most barricades and limit the area with activists to the East Precinct building and the street directly in front of it. That day, CHOP organizers also expressed their intention to refocus on the area near the police station and away from the sprawling encampment at Cal Anderson Park, after it became a political liability as they struggled to maintain security. In the early morning hours of June 29, a fourth shooting left a 16-year-old boy dead and a 14-year-old boy in critical condition with gunshot injuries. Calling the situation \\"dangerous and unacceptable\\", SPD Chief Best told reporters, \\"Enough is enough. We need to be able to get back into the area.\\" On July 1, 2020, after the mayor issued an executive order, Seattle police cleared the area of protesters and reclaimed the East Precinct station. Protests continued in the streets of Seattle in the days following the closure of the zone.  Background  Modified sign for the SPD East Precinct, with \\"people\\" spray painted over the word \\"police\\" on June 13, 2020 Capitol Hill is a densely populated residential district situated on a steep hill just east of Seattle's downtown central business district. It is known for its prominent LGBT and counterculture communities, as well as its colorful vibrant nightlife. Seattle had previously been the location of other mass protests, such as the 1999 WTO protests and Occupy Seattle. The city is also home to several cultural institutions that were created through occupation protests, including the Northwest African American Museum, the Daybreak Star Cultural Center, and El Centro de la Raza. Protests over the killing of George Floyd and police brutality began in Seattle on May 29, 2020. For nine consecutive days there were street clashes in greater Seattle involving protesters, the Seattle Police Department (SPD), Washington State Patrol, and Washington National Guard.  Capitol Hill clashes (June 1‚Äì8)  The formation of the zone was preceded by a week of tense interactions in the Capitol Hill neighborhood that began on June 1, when protesters and police in full riot gear began to face off at a barricade police had set up near the SPD's East Precinct building. The SPD used aggressive dispersal tactics, including blast balls, flash bang grenades, and pepper spray. On June 5, Mayor Jenny Durkan and SPD Chief Carmen Best announced a 30-day ban on the use of tear gas. At the request of citizens, on June 6, a group of public representatives (including four City Council-members, a King County Council-member, state Senator Joe Nguyen, and state Representative Nicole Macri) joined demonstrators on the front lines when officers again used flash bang grenades and pepper spray to control the crowd. Protesters gathering at the SPD East Precint's western barricade on June 7 During the daytime on June 7, police installed sturdier barricades around the East Precinct and boarded up its windows. The situation further intensified that evening after 8 pm, when a demonstrator was shot while trying to slow down a vehicle being driven at excessive speed towards a crowd of 1,000 protesters on 11th Avenue and East Pine Street; the driver then exited the vehicle with a gun and walked towards the police line where he was taken into custody without further incident. It became known that the shooter's brother worked at the East Precinct. Several hours later, after police reported that protesters were throwing bottles, rocks, and fireworks, SPD resumed the use of tear gas (despite the mayor's ban), and released pepper spray and flash-bang grenades, on protesters at 11th and Pine, just after midnight on June 8. Over 12,000 complaints were filed about the police response to the demonstrations, and members of the Seattle City Council questioned how many weapons had in fact been thrown at the police. Police boarded up and vacated the East Precinct in the afternoon of June 8 in an effort to de-escalate the situation and rebuild trust. Protesters, initially suspicious of the SPD's motives, moved into the area, re-positioned the street barricades at a one-block radius from the station, and declared the area \\"Free Capitol Hill\\". Days after the event, it remained unclear who had made the decision to retreat from the East Precinct. Mayor Durkan latter attributed the decision to withdraw to an unnamed on-scene commander for SPD.  Territory  Aid station at the Bobby Morris Playfield backstop on June 3 The zone was initially centered around the East Precinct building. Barriers were set up on Pine Street for several blocks in order to prevent traffic from passing. The early territory reportedly encompassed five and a half city blocks, including a public park. It stretched north to East Denny Way, east to 12th Avenue (and partially 13th Avenue), south to East Pike, and west to Broadway. Cal Anderson Park was active with demonstrators. Protesters used blockades and fences to construct staggered barricades at intersections. One entrance to the zone's territory was marked by a barrier reading \\"You Are Entering Free Capitol Hill\\" on June 9. Other signs declared \\"You are now leaving the USA.\\" The signage on the police station was modified, as protesters rebranded it the \\"Seattle People's Department East Precinct\\" amid graffiti with anarchist symbols (according to one report). On June 16, after city officials came to an agreement with protest organizers on a new footprint, Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) crews installed concrete barriers wrapped in plywood in several areas of the zone along Pine Street, 10th Ave., and 12th Ave., effectively shrinking the area. The revised barrier spacing provided improved access for business deliveries and logistics, whereas the design (concrete with added plywood) offered space for decoration by artists affiliated with the protests. The new layout was posted on Mayor Durkan's blog, which explained: \\"The City is committed to maintaining space for community to come to together, protest and exercise their first amendment rights. Minor changes to the protest zone will implement safer and sturdier barriers to protect individuals in this area.\\"leftKIRO Radio reported that on June 17, a large tent encampment had been set up on 11th between Pike and Pine Streets and that half of Cal Anderson Park had been \\"turned into a huge tent encampment with a massive community garden.\\" The borders of the zone were not clearly defined, and were known to shift daily. The size of CHOP was reduced over time, with The Seattle Times reporting that the area had \\"shrunk considerably\\" by June 24. The demonstrators redirected their focus around the East Precinct on June 23 when \\"the Capitol Hill protest zone camp cleared parts of its Cal Anderson Park core.\\" On June 30, police and other city employees removed a number of the concrete barricades, while concentrating others into an area closer to the East Precinct. That same day, notices were posted to announce a noon closure of Cal Anderson Park for cleaning and repairs, with the garden and art created by protesters to remain undisturbed. The remaining territory was reclaimed by Seattle police on July 1, 2020. That same day, Cal Anderson Park was reportedly closed for repairs.  Culture and amenities = Services  The No Cop Co-op on June 10 Protesters established the No Cop Co-op on June 9, 2020, offering free water, hand sanitizer, and snacks donated by the community, along with kebabs. Stalls were set up which offered cuisine such as vegan curry while others collected donations for the homeless. Organizers pitched tents next to the former precinct in order to hold the space. Two medical stations were established in the zone to deliver basic health care. The SDOT provided portable toilets. The city provided services to the area, including waste removal, portable toilets, and fire and rescue services; the SPD also stated they responded to 911 calls within the area. The King County public health department provided COVID-19 testing in Cal Anderson Park for a period of time during the protests.Vegetable gardens planted during CHOP in Cal Anderson Park The Seattle Times on June 11 reported that restaurant owners in the area had an uptick in walk-up business and a concomitant reduction in delivery costs. However, on June 14, USA Today reported that most businesses in the zone had closed, \\"although a liquor store, ramen restaurant and taco joint are still doing brisk business.\\" The New York Times reported that \\"business crashed\\" in the zone. Activists lived in tents inside the zone. Outside the zone, urban camping is illegal in Seattle, (Seattle Municipal Code 18.12.250 ) \\"It is unlawful to camp in any park except at places set aside and posted for such purposes by the Superintendent.\\" though even before the zone this law was seldom enforced. = Community gardens = Vegetable gardens began to materialize prior to June 11 in Cal Anderson Park, where activists started to grow a variety of food products from seedlings. The gardens were initiated by a single basil plant, introduced by Marcus Henderson, a resident of the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle. Activists expanded the gardens, which were \\"cultivated by and for BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and People Of Color],\\" and included signage heralding famous black agriculturalists alongside commemorations of victims of police violence.  Discourse  Arts and culture = Visitors at CHOP's co-op on June 14The intersection of 12th and Pine was converted into a square for teach-ins, where a microphone was used to encourage people who were there with destructive intentions to leave the area. An area at 11th and Pine was set aside as the \\"Decolonization Conversation Caf√©\\", a discussion area with daily topics. On June 9, an outdoor cinema with a sound system and projector was set up and used to screen open- air movies including 13th (2016), a documentary by Ava DuVernayabout racism and mass incarceration, and Paris Is Burning (1990), a documentary film from Jennie Livingston. The Marshall Law Band, a Seattle-based hip-hop fusion group, began performing for protesters on June 8, continuing for \\"nearly a week\\" to play sets for several hours at a time. A block-long street mural saying \\"Black Lives Matter\\" was painted June 10‚Äì11, located on East Pine Street between 10th and 11th Avenue. Individual letters in the mural were uniquely painted by local artists of color, with supplies purchased through donations from demonstrators and passersby.  Shrines  Visitors lit candles and left flowers at three shrines, which featured photographs and notes expressing sentiments related to George Floyd and other victims of police brutality. On June 19, special events ranging from a \\"grief ritual\\" to a dance party were held in observation of Juneteenth.  Internal governance  Western entrance on June 10, with a sign echoing alt=Occupants of the zone favored consensus decision-making, in the form of general assembly, with daily meetings and discussion groups, as an alternative to selecting designated leaders. According to City Journal on June 10, former mayoral candidate Nikkita Oliver held a major role within in the zone. On June 11, observers described the burgeoning activity at the early zone as hybrids of other movements, with an atmosphere that was \\"part protest, part commune,\\" a cross between \\"a sit-in, a protest and summer festival,\\" or a blend of \\"Occupy Wall Street and a college independent cooperative dorm.\\" In an article from June 16, Vox stated that CHAZ had evolved into \\"a center of peaceful protest, free political speech, co-ops, and community gardens\\" after protesters recovered from their initial confusion over the choice by police to leave the precinct. Protesters held frequent town halls to decide strategy and make plans. Seattle officials say they saw no evidence of antifa umbrella groups organizing in the zone, while some small business owners in the zone blamed antifa for violence and for intimidation of their patrons. On June 15, SPD Chief Best said, \\"There is no cop-free zone in the city of Seattle.\\" Best indicated officers would go into the zone if there were threats to public safety: \\"I think that the picture has been painted in many areas that shows the city is under siege,\\" she added. \\"That is not the case.\\" On August 7, The New York Times described the zone as police abolition put into practice, reporting that police generally did not respond to calls in the zone. Misinformation about the zone's governance circulated. According to Snopes, conservative social-media personality Andy Ngo shared a video on June 15 of Seattle-based hip hop artist Raz Simone distributing a rifle from the trunk of his car to another protester on June 8 (the day the zone was first established), after \\"rumors developed that members of the right-wing group Proud Boys were going to move into the protest area to set fires and stir chaos.\\" CNN later referred to Simone as the zone's \\"de facto leader\\" a characterization that he denied.  Names for the area  The protest area was identified by several names, with the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) most common at the outset, along with Free Capitol Hill. By the second week of formation, the area was more often referred to as the Capitol Hill Organized (or Occupied) Protest (CHOP). On June 13, a group of several dozen informal protest leaders agreed to change the name from CHAZ to CHOP. The name change was the result of a consensus among participants to deemphasize occupation. TechCrunch further clarified the underlying logic at work stating that participants decided to change the name to \\"the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest ‚Äî then, noting the fact that Seattle itself is an ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù of native land, change the O to Organized.\\" KUOW reported that pavement at one intersection was repainted on June 14 with the new acronym CHOP following a discussion in which many of the most active participants had agreed to officially revise the name to the Capitol Hill Organized Protest for better accuracy. Other media reported the name change on June 15 (King5 and The Stranger), June 16 (Vox), and June 17 (Crosscut). alt=  Demands  There was internal debate over how many demands to put forward, as some believed the protests were the start of a larger revolution while others asserted police brutality should remain as the immediate focus. The stated goals of the protesters varied initially but settled on three main demands: # cut funding for city police by fifty percent; # redistribute the funds into community efforts such as restorative justice and health care; and # ensure that protesters would not be charged with crimes. One early list, released June 9 in a Medium post attributed to \\"The Collective Black Voices at Free Capitol Hill\\", outlined 30 demands, beginning with the abolition of the Seattle Police Department and armed forces, as well as demanding for the abolition of prisons:FreeCapitolHill. 9 June 2020. \\"The demands of the collective black voices at Free Capitol Hill to the Government of Seattle, Washington.\\" Medium. > The Seattle Police Department and attached court system are beyond reform. > We do not request reform, we demand abolition.‚Ä¶ This means 100% of funding, > including existing pensions for Seattle Police.‚Ä¶ In the transitionary period > between now and the dismantlement of the Seattle Police Department, we > demand that the use of armed force be banned entirely.... We demand the > abolition of imprisonment‚Ä¶ Other demands by the Collective include: * reallocation of funds (previously used for SPD) towards community health, specifically: *# \\"Socialized Health and Medicine;\\" *# \\"Free public housing;\\" *# \\"Public education;\\" *# \\"Naturalization services\\" for undocumented immigrants (along with the demand that such people be called \\"undocumented\\" because \\"because no person is illegal\\"); *# \\"General community development\\" (parks, etc.) * release prisoners serving time for marijuana-related offenses or resisting arrest and expunge their records; * mandatory retrials for people of color serving sentences for violent crimes; * reform of education to increase the focus on Black and Native-American history; * rent control, in order to reverse gentrification; and * free college. On June 10, approximately 1,000 protesters marched to the Seattle City Hall demanding the resignation of Mayor Durkan.  Security  A alt=Protesters accepted the open carry of firearms as a provision of safety. Members of the self-described anti-fascist, anti-racist, and pro-worker Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club (PSJBGC) were reported on June 9 as carrying rifles in the zone. Although the zone fell within the restricted area subject to Mayor Durkan's May 30 emergency order prohibiting the use of weapons including guns, her ban did not mandate enforcement. The Washington Post reported on June 12 that PSJBGC was on site but with no weapons visible, and USA Today the same day reported that \\"no one appeared armed with a gun\\". Reporters from a Tacoma-based Fox affiliate were chased out of the zone by occupants on June 9. During the occupation, area businesses hired private protection services, including Iconic Global, Homeland Patrol Division, and Fortress Security, that deployed men and women, some in uniform and others in plain clothes, armed with AR-15 style rifles and pepper spray, to patrol the zone on foot and in SUVs. Volunteers within the area also formed an informal group to provide security, with an emphasis on de-escalation tactics and preventing vandalism. On June 15, KIRO-TV reported a break-in and fire at an auto shop located near the zone, to which the SPD did not respond; Police Chief Best later stated that officers observed the building from a distance and saw no sign of disturbance. On June 16, Seattle's KIRO-TV quoted an eight- year tenant of an apartment near the East Precinct as saying, \\"We are just sitting ducks all day. Now every criminal in the city knows they can come into this area and they can do anything they want as long as it isn't life- threatening, and the police won't come in to do anything about it.\\" Frustrated by blocked streets, criminal behavior, and lawlessness, some residents temporarily moved out and others installed security cameras. A man who said he \\"100 percent\\" supports the protest told KOMO-TV: \\"I don't even feel safe anymore.\\" On June 18, a volunteer medic intervened during a sexual assault within a tent inside the occupied park area which resulted in the arrest of the alleged perpetrator. That same day, NPR reported, \\"Nobody inside the protest zone thinks a police return would end peacefully. Small teams of armed anti-fascists are also present, self-proclaimed community defense forces who say they're ready to fight if needed but that de-escalation is preferred.\\"alt= = Outside threats from Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer = From inception, there were reports that protesters at CHOP were aware of the threat posed by the far-right groups Patriot Prayer, active in the Pacific Northwest, and the Proud Boys, a national neo-fascist hate group. On June 15, armed members of the Proud Boys appeared in the zone at a Capitol Hill rally. This group of the Proud Boys aimed to confront what they called \\"authoritarian behaviour\\" by the protesters, with the resulting video of the clashes going viral. Proud Boys affiliate and known brawler, Tusitala \\"Tiny\\" Toese was filmed in the zone while punching a man and breaking his cell phone on June 15. Toese has long been known in the Pacific Northwest for engaging in fights, first as a leading member of Patriot Prayer and after early 2019, as an openly chauvinist member of the Proud Boys. He has been described as \\"the right-wing protester most frequently arrested in Portland.\\" Toese is a resident of Washington state and the subject of several reports by Portland's Willamette Week. He has not been prosecuted for violent offenses despite his own confession and witnesses confirming assault, lending to accusations that law enforcement is enabling his behavior. He was later arrested for violating his probation due to video evidence that showed him assaulting the man in CHOP. The Seattle Police Department blotter page about the order to clear the area of protesters listed FBI reported law enforcement incidents in the area. It shows 37 incidents in 2019 and 65 incidents through June 30, 2020. Crime in the area from June 2‚ÄìJune 30 rose 525 percent compared to the same period in 2019. In addition to two homicides and two non-fatal shootings, the increase included narcotics use, violent crimes such as rape, robbery, and assault, and elevated gang activity. Shootings= Prior to the zone  On June 7, the day prior to the zone's founding, a man drove into a crowd of protesters. He was intercepted by a protester who reached into his car and tried to stop him, before being shot by the driver. The victim suffered a gunshot wound in his upper right arm but was expected to recover fully within a year. The driver was charged with first degree assault.  During the zone  June 20 = In the early morning hours of June 20, two people were shot in separate incidents in the Capitol Hill neighborhood at the edge of the protest zone. It was unclear if the shootings were connected to the protests. An analysis by KUOW, based on 911 transcripts, video recordings, and eyewitness testimony, suggested that miscommunication between SPD and the Seattle Fire Department slowed the emergency response. Emergency dispatchers received the first reports of gunshots (at 10th Avenue and East Pine Street) at 2:19 a.m. A 19-year-old black man, Horace Lorenzo Anderson Jr, was transported to Harborview Medical Center with multiple gunshot wounds by volunteer medics, but was pronounced dead shortly afterward, at 2:53 a.m. A local rapper known as \\"Lil Mob\\", Anderson had graduated from high school the previous day. The second victim, 33-year-old, DeJuan Young, was found by a former nurse who, along with the help of a volunteer medic, determined he had two gunshot wounds. Young reported that he went to leave after hearing the first shooting but was surrounded by a group of men, called a racist term, and shot at repeatedly while at 11th and Pike. Transported to Harborview by 3:06 a.m., he was in critical condition the following day. KIRO-TV reported that Young was shot by different people a block away from where Anderson was mortally wounded. Young said \\"I was shot by, I'm not sure if they're Proud Boys or KKK, but the verbiage that they said was hold this 'N-----' and shot me.\\" He expressed concern that his case was not being properly investigated due to the perception that protesters had \\"asked for the police not to be there, so don't act like y'all need them now.'\\" However, Young was outside the zone during the shooting. \\"I was in Seattle streets,\\" he said. \\"So what's the excuse now?\\" Armed police eventually entered the zone in riot gear but were informed by protesters that \\"The victim left the premises!\\" City Council member Lisa Herbold, chair of the public safety committee, said the suggestion that the crowd interfered with access to victims \\"defies belief\\". SPD was reviewing public-source video and body camera video, but no suspects were in custody and a motive had not been determined. CHOP representatives alleged that the individuals involved had a history, which seemed to escalate because of \\"gang affiliations\\". = June 21 = Another shooting occurred on June 21, the second such incident in the zone in less than 48 hours. After being transported in a private vehicle to Harborview Medical Center, a 17-year-old male was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and released. He declined to speak with SPD detectives. On June 22, Mayor Durkan said the violence was distracting from the message of thousands of peaceful protesters. \\"We cannot let acts of violence define this movement for change,\\" she said, adding that the city \\"will not allow for gun violence to continue in the evenings around Capitol Hill.\\" The mayor announced that officials are working with the community to bring the zone to an end. \\"It's time for people to go home,\\" she said, \\"to restore order and eliminate the violence on Capitol Hill.\\" At the same press conference, Police Chief Best spoke of \\"groups of individuals engaging in shootings, a rape, assault, burglary, arson and property destruction.\\" She added, \\"I cannot stand by, not another second and watch another black man, or anyone really, die in our streets while people aggressively thwart the efforts of police and other first responders from rescuing them.\\" = June 23 = On June 23, there was a third shooting near the zone, leaving a man in his thirties with wounds that were not life- threatening. SPD was reportedly investigating, but the victim refused to provide information about the attack or describe a suspect. = June 29 = A fourth shooting in the vicinity of the zone occurred in the early morning hours of June 29. A 16-year-old African American male named Antonio Mays Jr. was killed and a 14-year-old male was in critical condition with gunshot injuries. Mays was a resident of San Diego, California and reportedly left home for Seattle a week earlier. In video from that night, a series of 12 - 13 gunshots can be heard at approximately 2:54 a.m., just before a voice yells warning of \\"multiple vehicles\\"; \\"multiple shooters\\"; and a \\"stolen white jeep\\" as protesters scramble into position. This is followed by a five minute lull before another 18 gunshots can be heard as the white jeep crashes into a barricade or portable toilet. While searching for evidence, SPD discovered that the crime scene had been disturbed. Police have made no arrests in any of the shootings at CHOP since June 20. According to Marty Jackson, a volunteer medic who witnessed the event, CHOP's security forces shot at an SUV that the teenagers crashed into a concrete barrier.  Reactions= Local  Mayor Jenny Durkan called the creation of the zone an attempt to \\"de-escalate interactions between protesters and law enforcement\\", while Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said that her officers would look at different approaches to \\"reduce [their] footprint\\" in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. City Council member Kshama Sawant, who belongs to the Trotskyist Socialist Alternative party, spoke to the occupants of Cal Anderson Park on June 8, 2020. She called for the protesters to turn the precinct into a community center for restorative justice. On June 10, Assistant Police Chief Deanna Nollette said in a news conference, \\"We're trying to get a dialogue going so we can figure out a way to resolve this without unduly impacting the citizens and the businesses that are operating in that area.\\" She said police had received reports that \\"armed individuals\\" were running barricades set up by protesters as checkpoints, \\"intimidat[ing] community members\\", and that police had \\"heard anecdotally\\" of residents and businesses being asked to pay a fee to operate in the area, adding, \\"This is the crime of extortion.\\" The following day, Best said the police had not received \\"any formal reports\\" of extortion, and the Greater Seattle Business Association said they \\"found no evidence of this occurring\\". The New York Times reported in August that during the zone's existence, some small business owners were intimidated by demonstrators with baseball bats, asked to pledge loyalty to the movement and choose between CHOP and the police, put on a list of \\"cop callers\\", harassed, or threatened with death by a mob. On June 11, the SPD announced their desire to re-enter the abandoned East Precinct building, and said they still operated within the zone's territory. Governor Jay Inslee, on the same day, said the zone was \\"unpermitted\\" but \\"largely peaceful\\". On June 12, Police Chief Best said, \\"Rapes, robberies and all sorts of violent acts have been occurring in the area and we have not been able to get to it.\\" In the early morning hours of June 12, an unknown man set a fire at the East Precinct building and walked away; community residents extinguished the flames before they could spread beyond the building's external wall or to the nearby tents. Later that day, Mayor Durkan visited the zone and told a The New York Times reporter that she did not know of any serious crime that was reported in the area. On June 16, a deal was struck between CHOP representatives and the city to \\"rezone\\" the occupied area to allow better street access for businesses and local services. On June 17, KING-TV reported that some are frustrated with the occupation of the area near their homes. One couple commented: \\"What you want from a home is a stress-free environment. You want to be able to sleep well, you want to feel comfortable and we just don't feel comfortable right now.\\" KING-TV reported also receiving anonymous emails from other local residents expressing \\"real concerns\\". On June 18, unease was reportedly being expressed by many black protesters about the zone and its use of Black Lives Matter slogans. According to NPR, \\"Black activists say there must be follow-through to make sure their communities remain the priority in a majority-white protest movement whose camp has taken on the feel of a neighborhood block party that's periodically interrupted by chants of 'Black Lives Matter!'\\" Artwork at entrance on Pine St. & 11th Ave. on June 24 On June 22, the Mayor of Seattle and the Chief of Police stated in a press conference that the police would reoccupy the East Precinct \\"peacefully and in the near future\\". No specific timeline was provided. On June 24, CNN quoted the \\"de facto CHOP leader,\\" hip-hop artist Raz Simone, as saying \\"a lot of people are going to leave‚Äîa lot of people already left\\" the zone. Also on June 24, Mayor Durkan proposed a hiring freeze on the police force and a $20 million cut to the SPD budget, a reduction of roughly 5% for the remainder of 2020 as part of an effort to compensate for a revenue shortfall and unforeseen expenses due to the coronavirus epidemic. During a public-comment period, some community members said that the budget cut should be larger and that SPD funds should be redirected to housing and healthcare-related spending. The same day, a dozen businesses, residents and property owners filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court against the City of Seattle, which they alleged had deprived them of due process by tolerating the zone. Stating that they do not wish \\"to undermine CHOP participants' message or present a counter-message\\", the plaintiffs declared that their legal rights were \\"overrun\\" by the city's \\"unprecedented decision to abandon and close off an entire city neighborhood\\", isolating them from the city's services. The plaintiffs seek compensation for lost business, property damage and deprivation of their property rights, plus restoration of full public access. On June 30, Community Roots Housing, a public development authority that owns 13 properties housing 694 people in CHOP's vicinity, called for shutting down the protest zone. \\"These residents have become victims of an occupation better characterized today by its violence, chaos and killings than anything else,\\" the organization wrote. \\"Forcing us to choose between anarchy and police brutality is a false dichotomy. Compassion and law-enforcement should not be mutually exclusive.\\" At 5:28 a.m. on July 1, Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan issued an executive order declaring \\"gathering in this area an unlawful assembly requiring immediate action from city agencies, including the Police Department.\\" More than 100 police officers, with help from the FBI, moved into the area and tweeted a warning that anyone remaining or returning would be subject to arrest. By day's end, 44 people had been arrested, and overnight another 25 were taken into custody. Seattle police also posted a video on YouTube containing examples of violent incidents in the Capitol Hill area. After reclaiming the East Precinct, the SPD maintained road blocks in the area and restricted access to local residents, workers and business proprietors. Some businesses reported that the continued police presence deterred customers.  National  On June 9, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas stated that the zone was \\"endangering people's lives\\". The next day, President Donald Trump demanded that Governor Inslee and Mayor Durkan \\"take back\\" the zone, saying that if they did not do it, he would do it for them. Inslee condemned Trump's involvement in the situation, telling him to \\"stay out of Washington state's business\\". Trump followed up by calling the protesters \\"domestic terrorists\\". Durkan told President Trump to \\"go back to [his] bunker\\". On June 11, Durkan responded further, saying that the president wanted to tell a story about domestic terrorists with a radical agenda to fit his law and order initiatives, but that lawfully expressing first amendment rights to demand better of society was patriotism, not terrorism. USA Today described the zone as a \\"protest haven\\", while the World Socialist Web Site described it as an \\"anarchistic commune\\". Conservative pundit Guy Benson mocked the occupation of Capitol Hill as \\"communist cosplay\\". National Review contrasted the mainstream media coverage of the zone, which they deemed as sympathetic, to the negative coverage of the 2016 Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation. On June 12, the Fox News website published digitally altered photographs of the area, to include a man armed with an assault rifle from earlier Seattle protests; also added to the photographs were smashed windows from other parts of Seattle. In a separate incident, the Fox News website ran articles about protests in Seattle; however, the accompanying photo of a burning city was actually taken in Saint Paul, Minnesota the previous month. \\"Fox's coverage contributed to the appearance of armed unrest\\", stated The Washington Post. The manipulated and wrongly used images were removed, with Fox News stating that it \\"regrets these errors\\". On June 15, Monty Python co-founder John Cleese mocked a Fox News anchorwoman for reading on air a Reddit post indicating purported \\"signs of rebellion\\" within the zone, which turned out to be a joke referencing a scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Protesters in other cities sought to replicate the autonomous zone in their own communities. Protesters in Portland, Oregon and in Asheville, North Carolina tried to create autonomous zones but were stopped by police. On June 12, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee condemned attempts to create an autonomous area in Nashville, warning protesters in the state that \\"Autonomous zones, and violence will not be tolerated.\\" In Philadelphia, a group established an encampment that was compared to the Seattle occupation; however, their primary focus was not autonomy but to protest Philadelphia's anti-homelessness laws. In what CNN called \\"an apparent reference to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in Seattle,\\" protesters on June 22 spray-painted \\"BHAZ\\", standing for Black House Autonomous Zone, on the pillars of St. John's Episcopal Church, which sits across the street from Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. The next day, President Trump tweeted, \\"There will never be an 'Autonomous Zone' in Washington, D.C., as long as I'm your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!\\" Twitter placed a public interest notice on Trump's tweet for violating the company's policy against abusive behavior‚Äî\\"specifically,\\" Twitter explained, \\"the presence of a threat of harm against an identifiable group.\\" Politico reported that CHAZ \\"was a recurring theme throughout‚Äù debate by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee of the Democrat-sponsored police reform bill, on June 17. Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) offered an amendment to cut off federal police grants to any municipality that allows an autonomous zone. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district includes CHAZ, blamed Fox News and \\"right-wing media pundits\\" for spreading misinformation. The bill was eventually approved by a majority-Democratic vote. On July 1, 2020, commenting on expulsion of protesters from the zone that day by police, U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended SPD Chief Best \\"for her courage and leadership in restoring the rule of law in Seattle.\\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, \\"I am pleased to inform everyone that Seattle has been liberated ... Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured.\\" The next day, President Trump said, \\"I'm glad to see, in Seattle, they took care of the problem, because as they know, we were going in to take. We were ready to go in and they knew that too. And they went in and they did what they had to do.\\"  Aftermath  Portrait of Charleena Lyles in CHOP Protests continued in the streets of Seattle after the sweep of the CHOP zone. The night of July 19, according to SPD statements, saw vandalism in the Capitol Hill area and a firework thrown into the East Precinct, starting a small fire that was rapidly extinguished. Donnitta Sinclair Martin, the mother of Lorenzo Anderson, filed a wrongful death claim against the city, alleging that the police and fire department had failed to protect or provide medical assistance for her son, and that the city's decisions had created a dangerous environment. Late at night on July 23, a group of 150 people returned to the Capitol Hill neighborhood and vandalized several businesses, including a shop owned by a relative of one of the police officers who fatally shot Charleena Lyles, a pregnant black woman, at home in 2017. On July 25, several thousand protesters gathered in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle for demonstrations in solidarity with Portland, Oregon. Tensions escalated in the neighboring city in early July after the Trump administration deployed federal forces against the wishes of local officials, stirring controversy and regenerating the protests. The Department of Homeland Security deployed an undisclosed number of federal agents to Seattle on July 23, without notifying local officials, adding to anxieties for the city's residents. A July 25 march by the Youth Liberation Front gathered peacefully for several hours in the early afternoon but it was designated a riot by the SPD after the protests devolved into property destruction towards several businesses, fires were started in five construction trailers near a future juvenile detention center, and several employees of the youth jail had their vehicles severely vandalized. The actions on July 25 resulted in the arrest of 47 people, with 21 police officers injured. Crosscut reported that many marchers participated on July 25 out of an understanding that the two central issues of the protest, police brutality and federal overreach, were deeply connected. On August 7, The New York Times reported that weeks after the protests, several blocks remained boarded up, and that many business owners were afraid to speak out about what happened to them. Public hearings on what to do with the CHOP public art and community garden began in August and were scheduled to continue in the following months.

Early life and education Gross was born in 1965 and raised in Princeton, New Jersey. Selected for the Presidential Scholars Program after graduating from Princeton High School in 1983, Gross led an effort to have Presidential Scholars sign a petition requesting a nuclear freeze, which was presented to President Ronald Reagan with signatures from 14 of that year's 140 honorees.Ben-Itzak, Paul. \\"'Freeze Girl' Backed On Views\\", The New York Times, July 17, 1983.

Miss Gross, who is now 17, began circulating the petition to her 140 fellow Presidential Scholars in May.... (Miss Gross, who graduated from Princeton High School last month, will enter Harvard in the fall.)\\" She attended Harvard University for her Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Literature and later earned her JD from Stanford Law School and Master's degree and PhD from Stanford University. Career Upon earning her PhD, Gross joined the faculty at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law (USC) in 1996. During her early years at the school, Gross earned three fellowships; a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Frederick J. Burkhardt Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, and a National Endowment for the Humanities Long-Term Fellowship at the Huntington Libraries. This allowed her to research American courts interpretations of racial identity throughout history. Gross' research led her to publish her first book titled Double Character: Slavery and Mastery in the Antebellum Southern Courtroom. The book focused on the legal proceedings of civil disputes over property in the deep South pre the American Civil War. She specifically focused on the legal dispute over slave ownership that required not only a moral judgment of slaves as human beings to be called into question but the moral judgment of the slave owners as well. In 2007, Gross received the USC's endowed faculty position title of John B. and Alice R. Sharp Professor of Law and History. Following her endowed faculty appointment, Gross published her second book What Blood Won‚Äôt Tell: A History of Race on Trial in America through the Harvard University Press. The book focused on how American society built race as a social and political construct and why racial identity was important. Her book received the 2009 Lillian Smith Book Award, the James Willard Hurst Jr. Prize, and the American Political Science Association‚Äôs award for the best book on race, ethnicity, and politics. The following year, she accepted a short-term residency in Japan through the Organization of American Historians and the Japanese Association for American Studies to teach at Kyoto University. During the 2017‚Äì18 academic year, Gross was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University to work on a manuscript for a future book. In January 2020, Gross and Alejandro de la Fuente co-published their book Becoming Free, Becoming Black: Race, Freedom, and Law in Cuba, Louisiana, and Virginia through the Cambridge University Press. They examined three slave societies during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Cuba, Virginia, and Louisiana, to explain how free and enslaved people of color used the law to gain freedom. In April, she was elected a Fellow of the Society of American Historians.

Two other African migrants were also injured in the attack. In May 2019, the Armed Forces of Malta soldiers Francesco Fenech and Lorin Scicluna were charged with the murder of Cisse and attempted murder of the two others, along with the attempted murder of another migrant in a hit and run attack the previous February. Background Lassana Cisse Souleymane (sometimes spelt Lassane) was a migrant from the Ivory Coast who worked in Malta. He was a father of three children, and at the time of his death he was 42 years old. He helped other African migrants upon their arrival in Malta, and he was described as a Good Samaritan by his friends. On 1 February 2019, Chadian migrant May Malimi was hit by a car while walking along Triq tal-ƒ†ebel, a country lane which connects the town of Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a to the migrant open centre at ƒ¶al Far. He was left unconscious and was later taken to hospital where he recovered. It was later revealed that this was a deliberate racially-motivated hit and run attack, and the suspected perpetrators of the Cisse murder were also charged with this attempted murder. Murder On 6 April 2019, Cisse and two other migrants, Ibrahim Bah and Mohammed Jallow, went to Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a to watch a football match between FC Barcelona and Atl√©tico Madrid. They later began to walk along Triq tal-ƒ†ebel on their way back to the ƒ¶al Far open centre, when at around 23:00 shots were fired at the three men from a car which is believed to have been a white Toyota Starlet. Cisse was killed while the two other men were injured. Police were called soon after the murder took place, and they called an ambulance after arriving on site. Aftermath The murder of Cisse is believed to be the first case of racially-motivated murder in Malta. It was widely condemned by Maltese politicians, public figures and NGOs. On 18 May 2019, Francesco Fenech and Lorin Scicluna were arrested and they were charged with the murder of Cisse and attempted murder of Ibrahim Bah, Mohammed Jallow and May Malimi. Both Fenech and Scicluna were soldiers with the Armed Forces of Malta, and at the time of the murder they were 21 and 22 years old respectively. The two soldiers denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. They were released on bail in December 2019. Compilation of evidence is currently ongoing. On 8 June 2020, an anti-racism protest was held in front of Parliament House in Valletta in the wake of the George Floyd protests, and the protesters called for justice for Cisse's murder.

She met Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz while he was working as a cultural attach√© in the embassy of the communist Polish People's Republic in Washington, DC. Apparently they had a brief affair, which ended when Zielonko moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne on a Fulbright scholarship. Mi≈Çosz was married; he was living in Washington with his wife, and his second child was born in 1951.Roe, Nicholas (9 November 2001). \\"A century's witness\\". The Guardian. In December 1950, during a visit to Poland, Mi≈Çosz's passport was confiscated by the Polish government because of suspicions about his lack of ideological purity. In early 1951 the government nevertheless allowed him to visit Paris (apparently the foreign minister's wife was one of his supporters), where he defected. His family remained in the United States, but the American government denied him a visa because of fears about communist influence. At the same time, intellectuals in Paris were supportive of communism, which increased his sense of isolation. Zielonko, he wrote later, was one of the few people he could speak to about politics and literature who understood him. Zielonko began translating The Captive Mind in the winter of 1951 and moved back to New York in early 1952. The two formed a close working relationship, although Mi≈Çosz said he \\"tormented\\" her during the translation: \\"friendship is one thing but when it comes to precision, I was implacable which, in reality, meant that I tormented her.\\" According to scholar Bart≈Çomiej Biegaj≈Ço, Zielonko's translation \\"frequently violated\\" the source text, with both omissions and additions, to produce a smoothly written English edition. Biegaj≈Ço writes that this was probably done with Mi≈Çosz's encouragement. Mi≈Çosz described his work with Zielonko in his book Rok my≈õliwego (1989), which became one of the few sources of information about her. In that book Mi≈Çosz wrote that Zielonko had been suffering from a terminal illness at the time and saw the translation as a \\"test\\"; if she were able to complete it, it would mean she had beaten the disease. Later life By 1968 Zielonko had married an American attorney, Frank Peel (1927‚Äì2018). In 2004 Peel wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal pointing out that an article the newspaper had published about The Captive Mind had failed to mention Zielonko. In that letter, he noted that she had worked as an adviser to Radio Free Europe and that she had accompanied Mi≈Çosz to Stockholm when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980. She died two years later. Translations *(1953). Mi≈Çosz, Czes≈Çaw. The Captive Mind. Trans. Jane Zielonko. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. *(1968). Ko≈Çakowski, Leszek (1968).

Her self-deprecation couldn't seem more sweet.\\" Robert Christgau, however, was less favorable, giving the album a \\"neither\\" rating, indicating that, according to him, it \\"may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't.\\" Track listingReferences Category:1997 debut albums Category:DreamWorks Records albums ","title":"Moon Hut"},{"id":"64228299","text":"Biramongol College, established in 1973, is a general degree college in Sawombung, Imphal East district, Manipur.

Emin Ali was the son of Bedir Khan Beg the last hereditary ruler of the Principality of Bothan and his spouse Rewshen. He attended an state school of the Ottoman Empire and after his graduation, he began a career in the Ottoman bureaucracy. He left Crete at the age of sixteen, and went to Constantinople to receive his formation. He returned to Kandiye in 1873, where he was employed at the local Ottoman administration.  Professional career  In the 1880s, he became a judicial inspector and worked in various cities and courts of the Ottoman Empire trying to implement the judicial reforms which have been issued in 1879.Henning, Barbara (2018), p.344 In 1888, he was dismissed from his post, and he was apparently without any work until 1894, when he was appointed first to the city council of Constantinople. In the early 1900s, he was again appointed as a juridical inspector, and was sent to several cities throughout the Empire such as Edirne or Ankara.Henning, Barbara (2018), p.344‚Äì345  Exile from 1906‚Äì1908  In 1906, the career of Emin Ali took a sudden turn as he was sent into exile after his cousin Abd√ºrrezzak Bedir Khan and his brother Ali ≈ûamil Bedir Khan were charged of being involved in the murder of Ridvan Pasha, the Mayor of Constantinople.  Engagements in Kurdish organizations  Judge Emin-Ali and his family Following the Young Turks Revolution against Sultan Abdulhamid II he was allowed to return to Istanbul and in 1908 he became a founding member of the Kurd Society for Cooperation and Progress. At the time he established close ties with Abdulkadir Ubeydullah, as he was also a member of the Kurdish movement. But the Society was banned in 1909 by the Committee for Union and Progress (CUP) as it didn't see any benefit of a Kurdish organization.Olson Robert W. (1989), p.15 In 1918 he was elected the Vice President of the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan, opposing the election of Abdulkadir as President. But the disputes continued as Abdulkadir advocated for a autonomy within a future Turkish state, as Emin Ali Bedir Khan was in favor for Kurdish independence but also the recognition of the state by a sultan as a Caliph. Emin Ali was also an active participant in the negotiations of the Paris Peace Conference. He maintained the view that the province of Van should be included in a Kurdistan, opposing Serif Pasha who represented the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan at the Peace Negotiations in Paris. He wrote a to the president of the peace conference in Paris and also showed a map, what according to him should include a future Kurdistan to the British representative in Istanbul, Richard Webb.Hasan √ñzoƒülu (2004),pp.39‚Äì40 Emin Ali would go on to establish the Society for Kurdish Social Organizations which advocated for an independent Kurdistan.Hasan √ñzoƒülu (2004), p.98 He didn't give up on the Kurdish cause and established ties with Greek diplomats who's support he was able to gain. Then he and his son Celadet Bedir Khan requested also the support of the British, to facilitate a Kurdish uprising in Mosul, but they declined to support the cause.Olson, Robert W. (1989), p.24 As it was imminent that a Turkish republic was to be created, he went into exile in Egypt, where he passed away in 1926.Hasan √ñzoƒülu (2004),p.100  Cultural interests  Emin Ali was interested in Kurdish literature and wrote Kurdish poetry, he was also passionate about western classical music.

Background The promotion was initially targeting another event to take place on this date at 3Arena in Dublin, Ireland. However, the organization confirmed in June that the Dublin card was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A UFC Heavyweight Championship trilogy between current two-time champion Stipe Miocic and former champion Daniel Cormier (also former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion) took place as the event headliner. The pairing first met at UFC 226 on July 7, 2018 where Cormier, as the light heavyweight champion, returned to heavyweight and captured the title by knocking Miocic out in the first round. Their second meeting took place at UFC 241 on August 17, 2019 where Miocic regained the belt and got his revenge via fourth-round knockout. Cormier also announced that he planned on retiring after this bout. A bantamweight bout between Pedro Munhoz and former UFC Lightweight Champion Frankie Edgar was briefly linked to UFC 251, but promotion officials elected to schedule the pairing four days later for UFC on ESPN: Kattar vs. Ige. On July 6, it was announced that the bout between Munhoz and Edgar was scrapped due to Munhoz testing positive for COVID-19. They were later rescheduled for this event. However, promotion officials then moved the pairing again to serve as the main event of UFC on ESPN: Munhoz vs. Edgar. A light heavyweight rematch between Magomed Ankalaev and Ion Cu»õelaba was expected to take place at this event. The pairing first met at UFC Fight Night: Benavidez vs. Figueiredo, where Ankalaev won via controversial knockout. The bout was originally expected to take place at UFC 249, on its original April 18 date. However, Ankalaev was forced to pull out of the event due to travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cu»õelaba then pulled out on August 11, after testing positive for COVID-19 and the bout was rescheduled for UFC Fight Night: Smith vs. Rakiƒá. Rog√©rio Bontorin was expected to face promotional newcomer Manel Kape at the event. However, Bontorin pulled out of the fight on July 22 due to an ankle injury. In turn, Kape announced his debut would be postponed and that he would not appear on the card either, also due to an ankle injury. A light heavyweight bout between Jorge Gonzalez and Ike Villanueva was expected to take place at the event. However, due to alleged visa issues for Gonzalez, the pairing was pushed back and expected to take place a week later at UFC on ESPN: Munhoz vs. Edgar. At the weigh-ins, Herbert Burns and TJ Brown missed weight for their respective featherweight bouts. Burns weighed in at 149.5 pounds, three and a half pounds over the non-title fight limit. Brown weighed in at 146.5 pounds, half a pound over the non-title fight limit. Both of their bouts proceeded at a catchweight and they were each fined 20% of their individual purses, which went to their opponents Daniel Pineda and Daniel Chavez.

Produced, and written by Peter Miller, co- produced by Joan Churchill and Alan Barker, edited by Jim Cricchi, with additional editing by James Holland, it immerses us in the national crisis surrounding care of people with serious mental illness through intimate stories of patients, families, and medical providers. Filmed over five years, Bedlam brings us inside one of America‚Äôs busiest psychiatric emergency rooms, into jails where psychiatric patients are warehoused, and to the homes ‚Äì and homeless encampments ‚Äì of members of our communities affected with serious mental illness, where silence and shame often compound personal suffering. The story is told in part by director Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD, a psychiatrist as well as a filmmaker, whose own life journey has been profoundly impacted by a family member with a serious mental illness. The film premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Synopsis To get to the bottom of the current mental health crisis in the United States, psychiatrist and documentarian Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD chronicles the personal, poignant stories of those suffering from serious mental illness, including his own family, to bring to light to this epidemic and possible solutions. Shot over the course of five years, Bedlam takes viewers inside the LAC+USC Medical Center‚Äôs overwhelmed and vastly under-resourced psych ER, a nearby jail warehousing thousands of psychiatric patients, and the homes ‚Äî and homeless encampments ‚Äî of people affected by serious mental illness, where silence and shame often worsen the suffering. The film follows the lives of three patients in particular who find themselves with a chronic lack of institutional support, while weaving in Rosenberg‚Äôs own story of how the system failed his late sister, Merle, and her battle with schizophrenia. Featuring interviews with experts, activists, individuals living with a mental illness, and their families, Bedlam builds on historical footage and commentary related to mental health, exploring the rise of this issue on a national scale in the mid- and late-20th century. The film includes the story of Patrisse Cullors and her brother Monte. During the course of filming, Patrisse co-founded Black Lives Matter as well as other advocacy organizations, based on her witnessing her brother‚Äôs battle with serious mental illness, repeated arrests and incarceration. Release Accepted as a rough cut, Bedlam was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival 2019 documentary competition. After Sundance, in 2019, the film‚Äôs team spent 12 months to re-edit Bedlam for commercial release and added new scenes, including a groundbreaking cancellation of a proposed ‚Äúmental health jail‚Äù in Los Angeles, the result of a community movement led by the film‚Äôs subject Patrisse Cullors, during the months after the film‚Äôs 2019 Sundance Film Festival screening.Rosenberg, Kenneth Paul (31 May 2019).

In the majority of cases resulting in patients and families traveling overseas to obtain procedures that are not proven, or part of an FDA approved clinical trial. These procedures have not gone through the vetting process of clinical research and they lack rigorous scientific support. Although for the general public, this advertising in glossy websites, may sound authoritative, for translational doctors and scientists this leads to the exploitation of vulnerable patients. These procedures lack the reproducibility, the rigor that is required for successful development of new effective medications. Although the term may imply traveling overseas, in recent years, there has been an explosion of \\"stem cell clinics' in the US which has been well documented. These activities are highly profitable for the clinic but no benefit for the patients, sometimes experiencing complications like spinal tumors, death, or financial ruin, all of which are documented in the scientific literature. There is a great deal of interest in educating the public and patients, families and doctors who deal with patients requesting stem cells clinics. Despite the great interest generated in the public for the use of stem cells, among all stem cell scientists, including the International Society for Stem Cell Research, the largest academic organization of scientist and advocates for stem cell research in the world. Stem cell \\"therapy\\" is an aspirational goal, is still under development and although there is a great deal of research around the world. Rigorous stem cell trials are still ongoing and patients should be educated to be aware of the unethical clinics in the US or abroad, that offer stem cells procedures as a cure when it is still under investigation. Furthremore, there is confusion in the general public between the concept of the \\"right to try\\" (RTT) legislation to the right to pursue any\\"stem cell preparations'. These are different concepts. RTT is usually approved for promising pharmacological compounds that have earned a sound scientific or pre-clinical support. In contrast to stem cell tourism infusions that do not. One of the key elements in the RTT is the concept of promising, that is not just a theoretical possibility but a demonstrable and reproducible evidence obtained by scientific experimentation. The right to try legislation seek opportunities for incurables and often terminal patients to receive the compassionate use of experimental therapies that have passed phase I clinical trials that have not gone through all the checks and balances needed for approval. In contrast to the stem cell tourism, these trials have oversight by the FDA and there is no direct financial exploitation for the patient and families.

It is found in the mountains of Colombia and Venezuela and may have been introduced to Jamaica. Like socalled wild blueberries in North America, it is artisanally tended in a manner that differs little from wild growing conditions, with few inputs. Its fruit is gathered in the wild and widely sold in local health food markets and grocery stores.  Description  It is a shrub which measures from 1.5 m to 7 m in height. The leaves are simple, alternate, elliptical to oval in shape, coriaceous (leathery), with a sharp, slight apiculate apex, cuneate base and a crenate margin. The flowers are tetramerous, or sometimes pentamerous, with a white corolla, possibly marked with pink or red. The inflorescence is racemic, producing 10 to 15 flowers per raceme. The fruits are round, approximately 1.2 cm in diameter, green during growth and dark red (giving the appearance of black or violet) upon reaching maturity, with an acid taste.Ruiz P√©rez, Gimena (2011) ¬´Morti√±o, fruta promisoria para la salud y la econom√≠a del pa√≠s.¬ª un Peri√≥dico 145.Casta√±eda Riascos, Ivonne Marcela (2006) ¬´Caracterizaci√≥n y divulgaci√≥n del conocimiento de poblaciones de (Vaccinium meridionales) morti√±o, presentes en los bosques alto andinos de la jurisdicci√≥n de Corantioquia. Segunda fase.¬ª Tesis de grado. Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Medell√≠n.  Planting and genetics  It is planted in plots at distances of 3x2 meters, without modifying its habitat since it is a wild species. The best propagation is obtained with seedlings with root buds from old lianas. As natural habitats disappear, there is a growing trend of cultivating wild vegetal species in seed banks. When propagation is done using seeds, the seedlings can be transplanted after a year and a half; when stakes are used, the transplanting can be done at six months by the rooting of branches, or layering. The productive life of the plants can extend to up to eight decades, with two fruit harvests per year. The successful conservation of the Agraz requires familiarity with its reproductive biology. This is a clonal plant that produces genetically identical individuals through vegetative reproduction, whose genetic structure is complex, with a mix of plants that arise from sexual and asexual reproduction; it is therefore advisable, in addition to field collection, to keep the seeds of a few plants, for a greater representation of genetic variability.  Cultivation in Colombia  In Colombia, the presence of this plant has been recorded between altitudes of 2,200 and 3,400 meters above sea level, and it is the only tropical country that proffers two annual harvests of this fruit. A group of researchers from the UN in Medellin chose as field work crops present in the municipalities of Guachet√° in Cundinamarca; California in Santander; and La Ceja, Santa Rosa de Osos and Entrerr√≠os in northern Antioquia. This study determined that these red berries, which are often consumed in processed form, undergo changes during their stages of maturation that affect their antioxidant levels.

The mountain is situated along the crest of the Cascade Range, on land managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Napeequa Peak, to the west, and Buck Mountain is to the east-southeast. Berge is positioned on Chiwawa Ridge with Buck and Napeequa, and other notable peaks on this ridge include Fortress Mountain, Brahma Peak, Cirque Mountain, and Chiwawa Mountain. Precipitation runoff from Berge drains to the headwaters of Napeequa River; or east into tributaries of the Chiwawa River. This peak was named to remember Richard Waldo Berge (age 23) who perished while climbing Baring Mountain on July 16, 1952. Berge was climbing with Fred Beckey at the time of the accident. Beckey's Cascade Alpine Guide credits Richard Berge wth several first ascents in the Cascades. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35 million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Mount Berge, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Mount Berge, volcanic ash is common in the area. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

In the United States, a state executive order is a directive issued by a governor that regulates operations of the state government and certain aspects of citizen life. Powers of state executive orders are limited by the respective state constitution and/or executive and state law, and are also subject to the provisions of the United States Constitution and any applicable federal law. Similar to presidential executive orders, they are subject to judicial review and can be invalidated if determined to violate any statutes or codes by which they are governed. The majority of them carry the force of law and remain in effect until revoked, suspended, canceled, proven unlawful, or expire by a date or condition set forth within itself. In 38 of the 50 states, there is no requirement for orders to undergo administrative procedure, which controls how they are formed and enacted. Six states mandate legislative review, and another six have these requirements only for executive orders of a certain type, like those having to do with the creation of agencies. Basis in state constitutions Powers of executive order can be either constitutional, statutory, implied, or ‚Äògeneral authority only' (Wyoming). In most state constitutions, there is no specific provision for the power of governors to issue executive orders. However, in many of those constitutions, there is a provision stating that the ‚Äúexecutive power shall be vested in the governor‚Äù (New York) or ‚Äúthe supreme executive power of this State, shall be vested in a...Governor...‚Äù (Nevada), or similar. These sections supplement and give way for executive and state law that grants the powers of issuance of executive orders to governors. Powers State executive orders are usually enacted less frequently than bills passed by state legislatures. They are especially used in the midst of a public health emergency or disaster. During a state of emergency (which usually can only be declared through executive order), the powers of the governor are widely expanded, often far beyond their normal reach. This allows for the release and reallocating of various state funds and resources to assist local governments and communities in dealing with crises, as well as modification of laws to aid in such. Additionally, in many states, orders can be used for a large range of executive actions, including but not limited to: *Temporarily suspending or modifying any statute, local law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation, or parts thereof *Granting clemency * Commuting or pardoning a criminal sentence *Declaring a state of emergency *Creating state agencies *Redirecting state agencies and departments to help a certain purpose *Issuing directives necessary to cope with a disaster or emergency Note that some of these powers can only be invoked after the declaration of a state of emergency. Reactions and controversy In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtually all US state governors have issued some type of order either putting in place a stay-at-home mandate or advisory. As tensions escalated and Americans grew tired of quarantine, there were many protests in response, especially in Michigan. These protests called for ‚Äúreopenings‚Äù of states, and many have brought into question the constitutionality of long-term quarantines and other large-scale societal changes imposed by governors.

A polymath steeped in ancient Greek philosophy, his writings are an important source for Syriac history and theology. George was born in the vicinity of Antioch around 640 or 660. His native language was Syriac, but he learned Greek and perhaps Arabic. He began his education as a small child with a periodeut named Gabriel. He became associated with the monastery of Qenneshre, where he studied under Severus Sebokht and may have acquired Greek. He was a disciple of Patriarch Athanasius II of Antioch and personal friend of Jacob of Edessa and John of Litharb. Shortly before his death, Athanasius ordered Bishop Sargis Zakunoyo to ordain George as bishop of the Arab nations or tribes. This took place in November 686 or 687. The nations or tribe that George served as bishop were the TanukƒÅyƒì, ·π¨≈´ øƒÅyƒì and  øAqulƒÅyƒì. They were generally bilingual in Syriac and Arabic. The heartlands of these tribes and thus George's diocese lay in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia.: \\"Syro- occidental Bishop of the Arab tribes of the Euphrates\\"; : \\"Noted polymath and bishop for the Arab tribes in the area of Aleppo\\"; : \\"bishop of the Arab nomads in Mesopotamia\\". His seat was at  øAqula. He died in 724. George wrote on a variety of topics, but his most important works are his translations of Aristotle from Greek into Syriac. He translated‚Äîor revised earlier translations of‚ÄîCategories, On Interpretation and the first two books of the Prior Analytics and wrote original introductions to each. He completed the seventh and final book of Jacob of Edessa's encyclopaedic Hexaemeron, a treatise on the six days of Creation, after Jacob's death in 708. He also wrote a commentary on the West Syriac liturgy for baptism and communion, and scholia (explanatory notes) to the orations of Gregory of Nazianzus. Among the poems attributed to him are a sermon on the life of Severus of Antioch and treatises on the monastic life, Palm Sunday, the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste and funeral services for bishops. The poem Myron has been attributed to him, but also to Jacob of Serug. Eleven of George's letters are preserved. They deal with matters of philosophy, astronomy, theology, literary criticism, liturgy and asceticism. They are an important source for the early development of Islamic kalƒÅm (philosophical theology). The nomocanon of Bar Hebraeus attributes to George the ruling that \\"a priest or a deacon who gives the Eucharist to the heretics shall be deposed\\". George was celebrated as a saint by the Maronites, who kept his feast on Saint George's Day (23 April). The Syriac Orthodox patriarch Ignatius Aphrem I gave him the honorific mar, but there is no record of his being treated as saint otherwise.

Mississippi State secured the SEC title outright with a win over Ole Miss on March 2. At that time, the SEC did not hold a postseason tournament, so the only conference title went to the regular season champion. Having long followed an unwritten rule that teams from Mississippi would never play integrated teams with black players, the Bulldogs had declined all NCAA Tournament invitations prior to 1963. In 1963, however, university president Dean W. Colvard decided to take a risk and accept the tournament invitation. On March 2, 1963, Colvard issued a statement announcing that he would be sending the team to the tournament \\"unless hindered by competent authority.\\" The decision faced challenges from the state college board and segregationists throughout the South, but ultimately the Mississippi State team was able to depart the state to play in Michigan. In what is now called the \\"Game of Change\\", the Bulldogs faced a majority-black Loyola-Chicago team in the Mideast regional semifinal. They lost 61‚Äì51, but won a consolation game against Bowling Green the following day to finish in 3rd place for the Mideast region.

History=Development In 1925, Frank Realmuto (a Richmond barber) organized a campaign to donate a statue of Christopher Columbus to Richmond's Monument Avenue; this campaign was supported by Richmond's approximately 1,000 Italian- American residents.Kollatz Jr., Harry (13 October 2014). Columbus Discovered. Richmond Magazine. Retrieved 10 June 2020.Kappatos, Nicole (July 2015). The story of the Christopher Columbus statue in Byrd Park. Richmond Times- Dispatch. Retrieved 10 June 2020. In May 1925, the Richmond City Council rejected a proposal to donate land for the statue alongside Monument Avenue on the basis that Columbus was both a foreigner and a Catholic; most of the council members believed that putting Columbus near monuments to revered Confederate figures would be inappropriate. This decision was widely criticized in newspaper editorials published across the United States, especially when it came to light that an opponent of the statue who spoke at the meeting was a member of a coalition that included the Ku Klux Klan. In June 1925, a committee of the Richmond city council decided to allocate land near Byrd Park for the statue. Fundraising began in February 1926 while Ferruccio Legnaioli, an Italian immigrant to Richmond, was selected to design the statue. Ground was broken in June 1926. Dedication The statue in 2012 The statue was dedicated on December 9, 1927. Over 2,000 people attended the dedication despite near freezing temperatures. At the dedication, Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd praised Italian dictator Benito Mussolini while Italian ambassador Giacomo de Martino claimed Italy sought peace. The ceremony concluded with de Martino pulling a cord to display an Italian and an American flag and the firing of a two-gun salute.

She is the Republican nominee for in the 2020 elections. She drew national attention for supporting the far- right QAnon conspiracy theory in Facebook videos. Greene later distanced herself from the conspiracy theory.  Early life  Greene was born in Milledgeville, Georgia, on May 27, 1974. She graduated from South Forsyth High School in Cumming, Georgia, and the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree in business administration.  Career  Greene began her 2020 candidacy in , but shifted her campaign to the 14th district after incumbent Tom Graves announced he would not run for reelection. In the days before the primary election, Facebook took down a Greene video for violating its terms of service. In the video she held an AR-15 style rifle and warned \\"antifa terrorists\\" to \\"stay the hell out of Northwest Georgia.\\" Greene finished in first place in the primary election and faced John Cowan in the runoff election. Greene defeated Cowan to win the nomination on August 11. Greene is considered an overwhelming favorite to win the seat in the general election, as the 14th typically votes heavily Republican. The 14th has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+27, making it the 10th most Republican district in the nation and the third most Republican district in the Eastern Time Zone. Among Georgia's congressional districts, only the neighboring 9th district is more Republican. Donald Trump carried the 14th with 75 percent of the vote in 2016, his eighth-best performance in the nation.Cook Partisan Voting Index for the 116th Congress On the day after Greene's runoff victory, Trump tweeted his support for her, describing Greene as a \\"future Republican Star\\" who \\"is strong on everything and never gives up ‚Äî a real WINNER!\\" Assuming she wins election, she will be the second Republican woman to represent Georgia in the House. The first, Karen Handel, was elected to represent the 6th in a special election in 2017, but was defeated for a full term in 2018. However, Greene would be the first Republican woman elected to a full term from a Georgia district. Greene was initially expected to face Democratic IT specialist Kevin Van Ausdal. However, on September 11, 2020, Van Ausdal withdrew from the race. This left Greene unopposed for the general election, though the district is so heavily Republican that Van Ausdal faced very long odds even if he had remained in the race. Since the 14th's creation in 2012, no Democrat has won even 30 percent of the vote.  Support of conspiracy theories  Greene supported the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, saying in videos posted in 2017 on Facebook that the theories were \\"worth listening to\\". She posted 57 articles found in the archives of the American Truth Seeker website. Greene later distanced herself from the conspiracy theory and rejected the label of \\"QAnon candidate.\\" She had stated in a video, \\"There's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it.\\" In a 2017 video posted to Facebook, Greene expressed doubt that the perpetrator of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting acted alone. She also called George Soros, a Jewish businessman and Holocaust survivor, a Nazi. After the 2018 midterm elections, Greene stated that the election of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib was part of \\"an Islamic invasion of our government.\\" In 2018, Greene expressed support for a conspiracy theory that a plane did not hit the Pentagon during the September 11 attacks, saying that \\"it's odd there's never any evidence shown for a plane in the Pentagon,\\" despite video evidence. She later admitted on Twitter that the 9/11 conspiracy theory is \\"not correct.\\" After the first round of voting in the 2020 election, Politico re-released videos published by Greene in which she expressed racist, antisemitic, and Islamophobic views. The videos were later condemned by Congressmen Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise and received criticism in the media. On September 3, 2020, Greene shared a meme to her Facebook page depicting herself holding an AR-15 style rifle next to a collage of pictures of Democratic congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Greene claimed that it was time for Republicans to \\"go on the offense against these socialists who want to rip our country apart.\\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the meme as a \\"dangerous threat of violence,\\" and Omar demanded that the meme be deleted after claiming that it had already triggered death threats. In response to questions from Forbes about whether the meme was a threat, a spokesperson for the Greene campaign called the suggestion \\"paranoid and ridiculous\\" and a \\"conspiracy theory.\\" Facebook deleted the meme the following day for violating its policies on inciting violence, prompting Greene to claim that Democrats were \\"trying to cancel me out before I've even taken the oath of office.\\"  Personal life  Greene and her husband, Perry, have owned Taylor Commercial, a construction company based in Alpharetta, Georgia, since 2002. She has long lived in Alpharetta, which is in the 6th District. While members of the House are only required to live in the state they represent, Greene stated soon after considering a run for the 14th that she intended to move to that district if she ran there.

The clergy chose to meet in the town's city hall. City hall was used until 1957, when it was decided that a more permanent site was needed. In 1958, land and funds to build the church were donated, and construction began soon after. Construction ended in 1959, and the church was officially blessed. Other features were soon added to the church, including its stained glass windows in 1990, its Mission Hall in 1998, and its garden in 2000.

They are dedicated to alleviating homelessness, developing character in children, and celebrating Christmas at the local nursing homes, respectively.

In the mid 1950s Webb established the CSIRO Rainforest Ecology Unit at Long Pocket Laboratories (Brisbane), commencing a long research partnership with Rainforest ecologist Geoff Tracey which, several years later, led to the publication of the first systematic classification of Australian rainforest vegetation in the Journal of Ecology in 1959. In November 1965 Webb, accompanied by Geoff Tracey, conducted a vegetation survey in the Wet Tropics which resulted in Webb putting forward a series of national park proposals in 1966 for the purpose of protecting the full range of the remaining habitats of the Wet Tropics. Entitled \\"The Identification and Conservation of Habitat Types in the Wet Tropical Lowlands of North Queensland\\", Webb's report was the first report of its kind and contained the first reference in scientific literature to the international significance of the lowland rainforests of the Wet Tropics. The proposals in Webb's report were specifically confined to the lowlands because of the extreme development pressures which had been placed on the lowlands from around the mid-1950s onwards. In 1975, a year after Peter Stanton , of the Queensland National Parks Dept. published an extensive field review of the conservation status of the wet tropics confirming that \\"the areas Webb and Tracey had identified were still some of the highest priorities for conservation\\",Webb and Tracey published a collection of 15 vegetation maps entitled \\"Vegetation of the Humid Tropical Region of North Queensland\\" which were used extensively in support of a number of major conservation campaigns across Queensland. These events ultimately culminated in many of the areas within Webb's 1966 report, including the Cape Tribulation and Daintree regions, being gazetted as National Parks in 1981. In the early '80s after decades of ongoing research, Webb and Tracey had accumulated a large corpus of scientific evidence which confirmed that Australian tropical rainforests had evolved from Gondwana over 100 million years ago and were not, as previously believed, relatively recent arrivals from South East Asia. This new understanding of the origins of Australian rainforests in addition to the publication of Geoff Tracey's 1982 paper \\"The Vegetation of the Humid Tropical Region of North Queensland\\" significantly contributed to the scientific basis for the subsequent successful World Heritage nomination of the Wet Tropics of Queensland in 1988. Webb was awarded Officer of the Order of Australia in the 1987 Queen's Birthday Honours Ceremony \\"For service to conservation, particularly in the field of rainforest ecology\\" He was also later awarded the Civilian Service Medal 1939‚Äì1945 in 1995 and the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for \\"For service to conservation and the environment in Queensland\\".

Elsie died in that hospital at age fifteen. The family learned years later that Elsie had been abused and may have had holes drilled in her head during experimental treatments including Pneumoencephalography . Elsie's body was eventually relocated to a grave near her mother's in Clover.https://pilotonline.com/news/local/health/article_17bd351a-f606-54fb-a499-b6a84cb3a286.html References Category:1939 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Medical controversies in the United States Category:People from Clover, Virginia ","title":"Elsie Lacks"},{"id":"64229978","text":"During the nationwide protests that followed the killing of George Floyd, protesters, politicians, religious leaders, and other groups called for police reform in the United States. This has led to laws, proposals, and public directives at all levels of government to address police misconduct and systemic racial bias, as well as police brutality in the United States. Some of the common reforms involve bans on chokeholds and no-knock warrants and improving police data collection procedures.  Background  On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, an African-American man, was killed by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A video of the incident depicting Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for an extended period, attracted widespread outrage leading to local, national, and international protests and demonstrations against police brutality and racism in policing. The unrest began as local protests in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before quickly spreading across the entire nation and internationally. The events are part of a wider Black Lives Matter movement, which began after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Police reforms have been a central part of the movement's demands, and protesters after the Floyd's death articulated several desired outcomes, some of which have been addressed by federal, state, or local lawmakers.  Federal = Justice in Policing Act of 2020  In June 2020, Democrats in Congress introduced the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a police reform and accountability bill that contains measures to combat police misconduct, excessive force, and racial bias in policing. Advocates and lawmakers have tried to pass police reform measures in the past, and their efforts received renewed energy after the high-profile killings of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other African Americans at the hands of police. The bill includes several provisions which aim to improve oversight, accountability, training, and documentation while placing restrictions on techniques like chokeholds and use of deadly force. It was introduced on June 8, and its status pending as of June 18.  George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act  The George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act is a civil rights bill proposed in the United States House of Representatives by Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), co-sponsored by Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Jason Crow (D-CO). The bill would implement national policing standards and accreditations, require agencies to share policing data with the Department of Justice, and make grants available for new programs that help departments recruit, hire, or increase oversight. It also requires the Department of Justice to assemble a task force responsible for law enforcement misconduct cases.  Ending Qualified Immunity Act  The Ending Qualified Immunity Act is a police reform bill proposed in the United States House of Representatives by Justin Amash (L-MI-3), cosponsored by 39 members of the House. The bill would remove the judicial doctrine of qualified immunity that protects law enforcement personnel from being held personally responsible for violating the rights of citizens. When introducing the bill, Amash stated that \\"The brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police is merely the latest in a long line of incidents of egregious police misconduct.\\" This pattern continues because police are legally, politically, and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people whom they have sworn to serve. That must change so that these incidents of brutality stop happening.\\"  Executive Order on Safe Policing for Safe Communities  On June 16, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Executive Order on Safe Policing for Safe Communities, which calls for independent credentialing bodies certified by the Attorney General and provides financial incentives for departments which work to attain those credentials. The credentials would be based on criteria set by the Attorney General, and should include a ban on chokeholds \\"except in those situations where the use of deadly force is allowed by law\\" as well as \\"policies and training regarding use-of-force and de-escalation techniques; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention; and best practices regarding community engagement.\\" The order also calls for creating a national database with information about \\"instances of excessive use of force\\". Regarding police interactions with people with mental health issues or struggling with homelessness or addiction, the order calls for increased training, increasing the capacity for mental health professionals and social workers to work with law enforcement, and researching community-support models.  States and municipalities = Arkansas  On June 9, 2020, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed an executive order to create a police task force to ‚Äúdeal with police training, certification, and standards.‚Äù The purpose of the task force is to study and review policies of de-certification, community policing, and recommended means of \\"enhancing the trust of law enforcement.\\"  California  Mural in Oakland, CA On June 5, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for new police crowd control procedures for the state and the banning of the police use of carotid chokeholds, which starve the brain of oxygen. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has recommended nine key reforms for local police departments in California, including banning the use of chokeholds, requiring officers to de-escalate situations and give verbal warning before using force, and requiring officers to intervene to stop another officer from using excessive force. = Berkeley = On June 9, 2020, the city of Berkeley permanently banned police from using tear gas. = Davis = On June 6, 2020, the Davis Police Department announced that it would prohibit officers from using chokeholds, and would require officers to intervene when observing colleagues using improper levels of force. = Los Angeles = On June 3, 2020, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said he would cut as much as $150 million from the Los Angeles Police Department's budget, a reversal of his planned increase of $120 million. Garcetti announced the funds would be redirected to community initiatives. = San Diego = On June 1, 2020, San Diego Police Department announced an immediate ban on carotid chokeholds, which starve the brain of oxygen. = San Francisco = San Francisco, CA On June 11, 2020, the city of San Francisco announced plans for police to stop responding to non-criminal activities such as neighbor disputes, reports on homeless people, and school discipline interventions. Under the proposal, police will be replaced with trained and non-armed professionals. = Vallejo = Touro University California banned the Vallejo Police Department from using its campus for training. The university's decision came after the shooting of Sean Monterrosa and after the release of a statement from the Vallejo police union which criticized protests of the killing by police.  Colorado  On June 13, 2020, the Colorado General Assembly passed SB20-217, banning the use of chokeholds, banning the use of tear gas without announcing it or allowing people to disperse, removing the qualified immunity defense, and requiring all officers to use body cameras by July 1, 2023. The bill, which was signed by Governor Jared Polis, on June 19th, will also prevent officers fired for misconduct from being rehired at other departments and force officers to face criminal charges for not intervening when another officer is violating use of force policies. = Denver = On June 7, 2020, Denver Police Department banned the use of chokeholds without exception and established new reporting requirements whenever a police officer points a gun at a person.Denver fully bans chokeholds, requires report for aimed guns , Associated Press (June 8, 2020). The department will also require its SWAT teams to activate body cameras during tactical operations.  Connecticut  On June 15, 2020, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont imposed a series of reforms on the Connecticut State Police, including a ban on chokeholds, a mandate that officers use body cameras and dashboard cameras, and restrictions on a program that funnels military equipment to local law enforcement.  District of Columbia  Black Lives Matter Plaza On June 10, 2020, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that she would sign the D.C. Council's emergency legislation to ban the use of neck restraints, tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and stun grenades by police. The council has also passed legislation requiring the mayor to release body camera footage from any police-involved death or major use of force within three days of the incident, with family members of the person involved in the incident to be the first to see the video.  Georgia  Atlanta = On June 15, 2020, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a series of administrative orders for police reform, including requirements for reporting deadly force and for training and use of de- escalation techniques.  Illinois  Chicago = On June 15, 2020, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the creation of a task force to review the Chicago Police Department's use of force policies. Lightfoot said the department overhauled its policies after the DOJ's oversight agreement and scathing report following the murder of Laquan McDonald but also said it's worth checking if the policies have withstood ‚Äúthe test of time.‚Äù  Indiana  Gary = On June 11, 2020, Gary Mayor Jerome Prince established a police reform commission to evaluate the police department's use of force practices and policies.  Iowa  On June 12, 2020, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a police reform bill into law, prohibiting the use of a chokehold in an arrest \\"except when a person cannot be captured any other way or has used or threatened deadly force\\" and preventing an officer from being hired in Iowa if they have a previous felony conviction, were fired for misconduct, or left before they could be fired for misconduct. The bill, which was introduced, debated, and unanimously passed by the Iowa legislature in a single day, also requires annual anti-bias and deescalation training for law enforcement and allows the Iowa Attorney General to prosecute officers for a criminal offense resulting in the death of a human being.  Kentucky  Louisville = On June 11, 2020, the Louisville Metro Council unanimously passed Breonna's Law to ban the use of no-knock warrants and requiring police to turn their body cameras on before carrying out a search. The law is named after Breonna Taylor, who was killed during a no-knock search by police in Louisville in March 2020. The public outcry after her death has been a significant part of the Black Lives Matter protests which gained intensity after the death of George Floyd.  Louisiana  New Orleans = In June, 2020, New Orleans Chief of Police Shaun Ferguson announced that the New Orleans Police Department would be adopting several new policy changes in an effort to address community concerns. In alignment with the #8cantwait movement, changes included officers being required to employ de-escalation tactics exhaustively before announcing to discharge weapons, the use of chokeholds being banned, and requiring officers to intervene and stop excessive force used by other officers; reporting these incidents immediately to a supervisor. On September 17, 2020, the New Orleans City Council voted to strongly limit the use of tear gas by law enforcement within city limits. The ordinance prohibits the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) ‚Äúor any other law enforcement officer‚Äù operating within city limits from using chemical agents like tear gas on citizens except in certain extreme circumstances like hostage situations.  Massachusetts  Several state-level bills are pending in Massachusetts. Representatives Russel Holmes and David Vieira proposed one to develop standards for hiring, training, ethical conduct, and retention of police. Representative Liz Miranda proposed another bill limiting police use of force and collecting data about race in arrests. Other bills would establish an agency focused on diversity in state government and a Commission on Structural Racism which would research racial inequality in the criminal justice system.  Michigan  On May 28, Michigan State Senator Jeff Irwin introduced Senate Bill 945 which would require the addition of \\"implicit bias, de-escalation techniques, and mental health screening\\" as part of the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards certification process for new law enforcement officers. The bill was drafted before the death of George Floyd in response to the broader problem of police brutality. It passed the State Senate unanimously on June 4.  Minnesota  On July 21, 2020, the Minnesota state legislature passed major police reform legislation. The new compromise law includes a limited ban on police from using chokehold restraint in the state of Minnesota so long as the officers were not at greater risk. However, the law also bans the old warrior training program, which was regarded as dehumanizing people and encouraging aggressive conduct. The law also requires training peace officers throughout the state of Minnesota to deal with people with autism or in a mental health crisis and also de- escalation training for situations that could turn volatile. The law also creates a special independent unit at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for investigations of fatal police encounters and also a new community relations advisory council to consult with the Police Officers Standards and Training Board on policy changes. The police reform legislation was signed into law by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on July 23, 2020. = Minneapolis = Graffiti and political messages on a boarded up store in Minneapolis, June 4 The widescale protests are a reaction to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, making it one of the major protest locations in the weeks that followed, and a significant public scrutiny of its law enforcement policies. On June 5, 2020, the Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed to a temporary restraining order requiring Minneapolis to update its procedures to ban chokeholds and other neck restraints by police, such as the one an officer used in the incident when George Floyd was killed. The order also went further by requiring police officers to report and intervene against the use of excessive force by other officers, and requiring authorization from the police chief or deputy police chiefs before using crowd-control weapons such as chemical agents and rubber bullets. Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council a veto-proof majority pledged on June 7 to dismantle the city's police department, despite opposition from the city's mayor, Jacob Frey. On June 26, 2020, a proposed amendment was approved by the Minneapolis City Council On August 5, 2020, the Minneapolis City Charter Commission cancelled plans to put the proposed city charter amendment which was passed by the Minneapolis City Council on the November 2020 ballot. The University of Minnesota and Minneapolis Public Schools changed their relationship with the city's police force, with the city's school board voting to cut ties with the department. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board also voted unanimously to have the park police cut ties with the city's police force, and to change park police uniforms and vehicles to distinguish them from Minneapolis police. On June 10, 2020, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced the police department is withdrawing from union contract negotiations as a first step towards police reforms.  Missouri  Kansas City = On June 4, 2020, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas announced a series of police reforms, including whistleblower protections, independent review of officer-involved shootings, and use of body cameras by police officers.  New Jersey  On June 5, 2020, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced that the state will ban police departments from using chokeholds and similar neck and carotid restraints. According to Grewal's order, \\"Because these tactics create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm, officers who cause a subject's death or injury while performing them face potential criminal liability\\" except when \\"deadly force is necessary to address an imminent threat to life\\".  New York  New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins on June 10 On June 8, 2020, the New York State Legislature began to approve a series of bills targeting police misconduct, including the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, making police use of a chokehold a felony punishable with up to 15 years in prison. The legislature also passed a prohibition on race-based profiling and mandated tracking of race and ethnicity data in arrests. On June 9, the legislature repealed section 50-a of the New York Civil Rights Law, which required permission by an officer or a judge in order to release any \\"personnel records used to evaluate performance\\" of that officer. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bills into law on June 12 at a ceremony including Valerie Bell and Gwen Carr (mothers of Sean Bell and Eric Garner, respectively), NAACP President Hazel Dukes, and Al Sharpton. On June 12, Cuomo also signed an executive order mandating that all police departments get local government approval for a reform plan by April 1, 2021, in order to continue to be eligible for state funding. On June 15, 2020, Cuomo signed three additional pieces of police reform legislation into law. The legislation will change reporting requirements for police discharge of firearms, will require courts to compile demographic data on policing, and will ensure that police provide medical and mental health assistance when individuals in police custody require assistance. On June 17, Cuomo signed a bill requiring state troopers to use body cameras during \\"all uses of force, all arrests and all interactions with people suspected of criminal activity\\", among other situations. = Buffalo = On June 10, 2020, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown announced a series of police reforms, including policy changes for body cameras and the policing of non-violent offenses, requirements of de- escalation and bias training, and the establishment of a special commission to examine police policies and procedures. = New York City = Brooklyn Bridge On June 7, 2020, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that funds would be reallocated from the NYPD into youth and social services. De Blasio did not specify how much funding would be diverted but expressed intent to work with the City Council to come up with a plan before the July 1 budget deadline. De Blasio also announced that the enforcement of street vendor laws and regulations would no longer be carried out by the NYPD. On June 15, 2020, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea announced that the department was disbanding its plainclothes units and reassigning those roughly 600 officers. Plainclothes officers will remain in the city's transit system. On June 18, 2020, the New York City Council passed a series of police reforms, including a bill to criminalize the use of chokeholds by the New York Police Department (NYPD), legislation with enough support to overcome a mayoral veto after it stalled after the killing of Eric Garner. The council also voted to require police to report on its surveillance of residents, to require officers to show badge numbers, and to create a new disciplinary matrix. As the city's June 30 budget deadline approached, protesters convened in City Hall Park to \\"Occupy City Hall\\", filling the park day and night to call for reducing the NYPD bugdet. On June 30, the City Council passed a budget which removes $1 billion from the NYPD. It cancels plans to hire 1,160 new police and transfers responsibility to monitor vending, homeless populations, and schools to other entities. According to the New York Times, the details of the budget \\"seemed to please no one\\". Those seeking reforms to policing did not think it went far enough, while others pointed to increasing crime rates in the city at the time. The budget does not halt a different wave of police hiring planned for October, while it does continue a freeze on many other city employees like teachers. Jumaane Williams cited an obscure law requiring the Public Advocate to authorize collection of real estate taxes, and threatened not to do so if the next class of officers was not also canceled. In August 2020, the New York Times reported that the $1 billion cut from the police budget mostly involved shifting some responsibilities to other city agencies, with the size of the police force barely changing.  North Carolina  Charlotte = On June 8, 2020, the Charlotte City Council passed Braxton Winston's legislation to ban the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department from funding new or existing chemical agents used in crowd control and dispersal, such as tear gas.

Oregon  Portland = On June 5, 2020, Portland Public Schools cancelled its school resource officers program with the Portland Police Bureau. On June 9, 2020, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced a series of police reforms, including disbanding the gun violence reduction unit, ending city officers' participation in the Transit Police, and reallocating money saved plus $5 million on initiatives \\"to help build the health, wealth and well-being of black people in Portland.\\"  Pennsylvania  On June 8, 2020, members of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus took over the floor of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to protest police brutality and demand action on a series of police reform bills. On June 30, The Pennsylvania General Assembly unanimously approved two bills that would bring about the largest changes to Pennsylvania policing in 40 years. The first requires a thorough background check of applicants and establishes an electronic database that contains records if an officer separated from any previous departments. The second requires mental health evaluations with a focus on PTSD and training for officers on trauma-Informed care, use of force, de-escalation techniques, and recognizing signs of child abuse and childhood trauma. Governor Tom Wolf signed these two measures into law on July 14.  Rhode Island  As part of Governor Gina Raimondo's \\"Rise Together\\" directive, the Rhode Island State Police agreed to obtain and wear body cameras.RI State Police in ‚Äòfull support‚Äô of troopers wearing body cameras All 48 local police chiefs in the state signed a pledge to do the same and to increase anti-bias training and diversity of hiring.Rhode Island police chiefs sign statewide policy reform campaign  Tennessee  House Democrats in Tennessee introduced the \\"George Floyd Act,\\" a series of police reform amendments, but the bill is on hold until a Senate bill is heard in December 2020.  Texas  Austin = On June 11, 2020, the Austin City Council unanimously approved a series of police reforms, including a ban on the use of \\"less lethal\\" munitions during protests, restrictions on the use of deadly force, and a direction to the city manager to propose reductions to the police department's budget in 2021. Ultimately, the department‚Äôs budget was reduced by $150 million with the money being reinvested into various initiatives like violence prevention, food access, and abortion access. = Dallas = On June 5, 2020, the Dallas Police Department implemented \\"duty to intervene\\" policy that required officers to act if they witnessed fellow officers using excessive force. Furthermore, the city council approved a $7 million cut in the Dallas Police Department‚Äôs overtime budget to reinvest in other initiatives. = Houston = On June 10, 2020, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner signed an executive order that limited the police ability to use excessive force and no-knock raids.  Washington  Bellevue = The City of Bellevue announced on June 5, 2020 that it would no longer allow neck restraints. = Seattle = Following a large and peaceful demonstration on June 3, 2020, the City of Seattle announced several changes to its policing protocols, including restrictions on badge coverings for officers. City Attorney Pete Holmes announced that the city would withdraw its request to lift a federal consent decree that had been imposed following a DOJ investigation in 2012. The city government also announced a 30-day ban on the use of tear gas by police on protesters in response to outcry from Capitol Hill residents who had been affected by its use. The ban did not apply to SWAT and other special officers, however, and tear gas was used the following day. On June 9, 2020, Seattle Schools Superintendent Denise Juneau announced that a resolution would be put to the school board to reevaluate the relationship between Seattle Schools and the Seattle Police Department regarding four School Emphasis Officers, employed and paid by the City of Seattle and one SPD School Resource Officer, also paid by the city. On June 15, 2020, Seattle City Council passed Kshama Sawant's legislation to ban the use of chokeholds, including neck and carotid restraints. The lawmakers also passed Sawant's ban on the use of crowd weapons by police, including tear gas, acoustic weapons, and water cannons, as well as Lisa Herbold's ban on badge mourning bands. Discussions continued through July on defunding and restructuring the Seattle Police Department although concrete actions have yet to be finalized by the city council. = Tacoma = On June 16, the Tacoma Police Department announced a commitment to reforms in line with the 8 Can't Wait campaign. Police Chief Don Ramsdell said the department already had five of the eight requirements, but would commit to the other three: a ban on chokeholds, duty of officers to intervene when seeing others use excessive force, and require verbal warnings before use of deadly force.  Wisconsin  Racine = On June 11, 2020, leaders of Racine unanimously agreed to establish the Mayor's Task Force on Police Reform and to spend up to $47,500 out of the police department's budget for listening sessions.  International = Canada  On June 9, 2020, the Halifax Regional Council voted to cancel the order of an armored police vehicle and to reallocate the vehicle's $368,000 cost to the city of Halifax's diversity and inclusion office, public safety office, and anti-racism programs. On June 25, 2020, Mayor of Toronto John Tory tabled a motion to \\"detask\\" the Toronto Police Service in response to calls for police reform sparked by the police killing of Floyd and a series of similar incidents in Toronto and elsewhere in Canada, such as the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet. Under the proposal, duties currently assigned to sworn officers would be assumed by \\"alternative models of community safety response\\" to incidents where neither violence nor weapons are at issue, such as some calls regarding persons suffering mental health crises, with the specific redirected duties and alternative models to be developed based on a report that the motion would commission. The proposal would ‚Äúcommit that its first funding priority for future budgets [be] centered on a robust system of social supports and services\\" and make an itemized line-by-line breakdown of the police budget public; a reduction in the police budget would likely ensue, according to the motion. New Zealand In June 2020, New Zealand police decided to terminate a pilot program and keep its officers unarmed in ordinary circumstances. Police attributed the decision to public feedback, though Maori activists said the George Floyd protests helped avoid the \\"Americanization\\" of New Zealand police.As New Zealand Police Pledge To Stay Unarmed, Maori Activists Credit U.S. Protests See also * 8 Can't Wait * 8 to Abolition * Defund the police * List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests * Police abolition movement  References  Category:George Floyd protests in the United States Category:Law enforcement in the United States Category:Law enforcement-related lists ","title":"List of police reforms related to the George Floyd protests"},{"id":"64229997","text":"Queen Elizabeth's Oak was a veteran oak tree in Greenwich Park, London. Seeded in the 12th century, the tree formed part of the grounds of the Palace of Placentia, home to the Tudor royal family. Henry VIII is said to have danced around the tree with Anne Boleyn. Their daughter Elizabeth I, after whom the tree is named, is said to have picnicked beneath its canopy, or else within its hollow trunk. When the palace grounds became Greenwich Park, the hollow tree was used as a prison for criminals caught on the grounds. The tree died in the 19th century but was left standing, partly supported by ivy. It fell in a storm in June 1991 and has been left lying where it fell, protected by a fence and marked with a plaque. Royal connection The oak is thought to date from the 12th century and was incorporated into the grounds of the Tudor Palace of Placentia. The palace was the birthplace of Henry VIII (1491) as well as his daughters Mary (1516) and Elizabeth (1533). The palace was one of Henry's favourite places; he spent much time in its grounds and is said to have danced around the tree with Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother. Elizabeth spent some of her childhood at the palace and is said to have picnicked under the tree, or by some accounts, within its hollow trunk. Prison The palace was later abandoned by the royal family and it became the site of the Greenwich Naval Hospital and the Royal Naval College; part of the grounds became Greenwich Park. A park keeper's lodge was erected near to the tree in the 17th century and was demolished in 1853. The tree's hollow trunk was used as a prison for criminals caught within the park, who were secured behind a heavy wooden door which covered the diameter hole in the trunk. Death and commemoration Queen Elizabeth's Oak had died by the 1870s. The tree was left standing as dead wood, partly supported by a large growth of ivy. The tree was a stump by 1979 and fell during a storm in June 1991. The dead tree was left lying on the ground. A replacement oak tree, donated by the Greenwich Historical Society, was planted by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 3 December 1992 to mark the ruby jubilee of the reign of Elizabeth II. The site is marked by a plaque and both the fallen tree and its replacement are protected from damage by a metal railing fence.

Elizabeth I is said to have been sitting beneath the tree when she was told of her accession to the throne in 1558. The tree was visited by Queen Victoria and Albert in 1846 and they were presented with a branch and an acorn from it as a memento. The tree had deteriorated by the early 20th century and its remains were removed in 1978. A replacement oak was planted on the site by Elizabeth II in 1985.  History  Hatfield Palace was acquired by Henry VIII in 1538 and served as a nursery for his children including Mary, Elizabeth and Edward. When the Catholic Mary came to the throne in 1553 she kept Protestant Elizabeth under house arrest at the palace to prevent her from plotting to seize the throne. Elizabeth would often sit beneath the oak tree which came to bear her name as, being from the house, it marked the farthest point she was permitted to travel. When Mary died on 17 November 1558, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne. It is said that the messenger from London bearing this news imparted it to Elizabeth while she was sitting beneath this tree, reading the bible or eating an apple (or perhaps both). Elizabeth's famous response was supposedly \\"this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes\\". Hatfield Palace was later swapped by James I for Theobalds House, owned by Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, one of Elizabeth's advisers. Cecil demolished much of the palace and built a new house nearby. The oak was located near to one of the avenues leading to the new house. George III visited Hatfield House in 1800 and may have viewed the oak. Victoria and Albert visited in 1846, by which time the tree was enclosed by a fence and protected by a lead covering. A small branch from the tree and an acorn were presented to the queen as a memento. The American journalist Joel Cook visited the site and, in an 1882 book, described the remains of the oak as \\"one of the most precious memorials at Hatfield\\". By 1935 the tree was little more than a stump supported by props and bound with iron. The dead stump was removed on 17 November 1978, the 420th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth and the remains are kept in storage. Elizabeth II planted a replacement oak tree on the site of the original on 22 July 1985.  Modern times  The field the oak stands in has hosted a number of events. These have included an annual agricultural show, the Slam Dunk Festival South (pop-punk, ska punk, emo, metal and alternative rock festival) and, since 2008, the Folk by the Oak folk music festival.

The first condition, epistemic benefit, governs a situation where the memory supports significant epistemic benefit to an agent. The second condition is when a less distorted memory when a epistemic benefit is not available.  Epistemic benefit  It includes the maximizing of the acquisition and retention of true beliefs, promotion of intellectual virtues, or avoiding epistemic blame.  No alternatives  It is a condition where there is no alternative to adopting a delusional belief due to the unavailability of supporting evidence. The unavailability can be of three types strictly unavailable, motivationally unavailable, or explanatorily unavailable.

Nadeau's research is focused in the areas of neurorehabilitation; behavioral neuroscience; language and aphasia; and connectionist approaches to brain function. He has written over 150 papers. In 2012, he wrote the book, The Neural Architecture of Grammar. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.  Early life and education  Nadeau was born in Cairo, Egypt.

He has been the medical director of two VA Office of Research and Development funded research centers, the Brain Rehabilitation Research Center and the Rehabilitations Outcomes Research Center.  Research  Nadeau's research interests have focused primarily on the neural basis of language function, neuroplasticity and neurorehabilitation. His most cited paper on language function dissected the neural and vascular mechanisms by which aphasia might occur with subcortical lesions. It provided evidence that the basal ganglia have little role in language function and that acute/subacute strokes involving select regions of the thalamus (the anterior pole, internal medullary lamina, and centromedian/parafascicular nuclei) produce at least transient lexical-semantic dysfunction.Nadeau SE, Crosson B.

As a result of the explosion, the attacker and a police officer died and seven others were injured.  Background  On 20 July 2012, a fire was opened on the police from a taxi that did not comply with the stop warning of the police teams located at the entrance of the Gazi neighborhood in the Sultangazi district of Istanbul. Following the clash with the police, those in the taxi demanded that the taxi leave the area by placing a gun on the driver's head. Proceeding about 100 meters, the taxi stopped after crashing into the pavement. One of the two men in the vehicle was caught at the scene and the woman trying to escape was injured in Gaziosmanpa≈üa. It was determined that these people were Hasan Selim G√∂nen and Sultan I≈üƒ±kli, members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C). G√∂nen died on 21 July in the hospital where he was being treated. After the death of Hasan Selim G√∂nen, the information that DHKP-C was preparing for action against the police stations was reported to the press.  Attack  Location of the police station At 11:00 (UTC+03:00) local time on 11 September 2012, the attacker who came to the 75th Anniversary Police Station in Sultangazi crossed the guard cabin at the gate of the police station and the 50-meter pathway between the garden entrance and the police station entrance. After climbing the stairs at the entrance of the police station, he reached the x-ray device at the entrance door. There he threw a grenade inside, but it did not explode. Then, the police officer B√ºlent √ñzkan tried to stop and push the attacker out of the police station. Meanwhile, the assailant detonated the explosives he was carrying. According to the statement of the police officer who was on duty at the door, the sound of hand gunshots were heard twice from the building after the suspect entered. It was stated that these gunshots occurred when the police officer √ñzkan, who later died from his injuries, shot his gun twice just before the explosion.  Losses and damages  At the time of the attack, the police officer √ñzkan, who had sustained serious injuries, died on the road to hospital. A total of 7 people were injured, including 4 police officers and 3 civilians. The wounded were treated at Baƒücƒ±lar State Hospital, Okmeydanƒ± Training and Research Hospital and Bezmi√¢lem Vakƒ±f University Medical Faculty Hospital. After the explosion, a hole was formed in the entrance of the building after the partial collapse of the entrance gate. The windows of the armored vehicles outside the building were broken.  Investigation and assailant profile  In the examination made after the incident, it was determined that the attacker was ƒ∞brahim √áuhadar, a member of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C), born in Alaca, √áorum, in 1973. √áuhadar had previously spent 8 months in Sincan F-type prison on the grounds that he was a member of DHKP-C. √áuhadar's body was taken from the Forensic Medicine Institute on 14 September and buried in the Gazi Cemetery in Sultangazi on 16 September. In the examinations carried out, it was determined that the explosive wrapped around √áuhadar's body was a pressure-acting and piece-effect plastic explosive. After the attack, DHKP-C took responsibility for the attack with a statement on a website linked to DHKP-C. In the statement, which included √áuhadar's photograph, the organization explained the rationale for this attack and said \\"Hasan Selim G√∂nen killed by the police officers of this police station. The Gazi police station was not a randomly selected police station.\\" In a photograph dated 30 August 2012 published on the website at midnight the same day, √áuhadar was seen wrapping the explosives used in the attack on his body.  Reactions  By releasing a written statement after the attack, President Abdullah G√ºl condemned the attack, which he stated to be carried out by the organizations he described as \\"terrorist groups pursuing outdated ideologies\\". Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan wished healing to the wounded and patience to the relatives of the police officer who died in the attack. Sabri Ba≈ük√∂y, Governor of √áorum, where √áuhadar's birth certificate was registered, stated that although √áuhadar was born in Alaca, he left the village for Ankara with his family 30‚Äì35 years ago, and had no connection with √áorum since then. Celal √áuhadƒ±r, the headman of Tutluca, also stated that the attacker was registered in the population of his own village and added that neither he nor the villagers knew him and condemned the attack. Speaking at the funeral of √ñzkan, who lost his life in the attack, Istanbul Governor H√ºseyin Avni Mutlu and Istanbul Police Chief H√ºseyin √áapkƒ±n condemned the attack. √áapkƒ±n said at the funeral, \\"We are 40 thousand people who are chiefs and officers to ensure the peace and security of Istanbul.

The first appointment Piso is known to have held is Praefectus annonae, the official responsible for the food supply of Rome. Two sources attest to this. The first is as one of the witnesses to the Tabula Banasitana, a bronze tablet dated to 6 July 177, which records the grant of Roman citizenship to a family in Mauretania Tingitana.

Biography  His father, Francesco, was a goldsmith and carver. His mother, Carolina, n√©e Raffaelli, came from a family of mosaic artists, with a workshop in Rome. One of his ancestors, Giacomo Raffaelli, helped to develop the modern micromosaic technique. In 1869, he attended a course on geometry at the Accademia di San Luca, and was awarded a prize for perspective. He was part of a group of watercolorists that included Enrico Tarenghi, Giuseppe Aureli, and Giulio Rosati. Although it would appear that they never travelled to North Africa or the Middle East, they created Orientalist works, based on photographs, other artists' illustrations, and traveler's descriptions. Much if his work was heavily influenced by his older brother, Attilio who, in 1875, was one of the cofounders of the . A follower of the Spanish artist, Mariano Fortuny and an organizer of festivals, Attilio had a large collection of carpets, dresses, damask fabrics, silks, slippers, brass, ceramic and copper objects, all original and from the Near East. With these accessories, Ettore was able to reconstruct the scenes for his paintings. Many of his works employed the same figures; rearranged or in different settings.Renato Mammucari, Acquerellisti romani: suggestioni neoclassiche, esotismo orientale, decadentismo bizantino, realismo borghese, Edimond, 2001 He also had a passion for the Eighteenth Century, with counts, musketeers, cardinals and ladies in period costumes. His influences, in this case, came from the Baroque painter, Pietro Longhi. In 1882, he participated in an exhibition of the \\"Associazione Artistica Internazionale\\" followed, in 1899, by one at the \\"Societ√† degli Amatori e Cultori di belle Arti\\" and, in 1900 at the \\"Societ√† degli acquarellisti\\". He occasionally taught at the nude drawing school at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. His nephew Amedeo, studied with him and also became an Orientalist painter.

Otaola is the host of the web show Hola Ota-Ola!, an informative and satirical program that covers entertainment news and politics. His show debuted on Cubanos por el Mundo: a cross platform media initiative, website, and YouTube channel that covers politics, news, and celebrity culture in Cuba and the Cuban exile community. In the United States, he has become a prominent voice of opposition to the Cuban government and a vocal supporter of the Trump Administration's foreign policies in Cuba.  Biography  Alexander Otaola Casal was born in Camag√ºey, Cuba on April, 23, 1979. For secondary school, he studied at a special athletic school in Cuba known as ESPA where he trained in water polo, horse riding, chess and ended up in gymnastics and musical aerobics. In an interview with CiberCuba, Otaola said he was born in a society with a machismo culture and experienced bullying and homophobia in Cuba. On December 3, 2003, Alexander emigrated to the United States from Cuba on a Visa. He settled in Miami where he worked as a waiter, cashier at Walmart, baker, and a manager in a housekeeping business. In 2008, he returned to television and worked in telenovelas and comedy shows. He portrayed the character Carlos Recto in the MEGATV show Esta Noche Tu Night hosted by Alexis Vald√©s, and also participated in Univision talk show ¬øQui√©n Tiene la Raz√≥n?. Later in 2015, he was suspended by the television network Mega TV for using and obsene word during an interview. In 2017, he started webcasting his show Hola Ota-Ola! which has a large audience in Cuban and the United States.  Political activism  Otaola has organized boycotts on Cuban artist such as Haila Mompi√©, Jacob Forever, El Micha, and Gente de Zona which has resulted in their shows being canceled in Miami. As a result of his social media activism, Haila Mompi√© was declared persona non grata in the city of Miami by the mayor Francis X. Suarez. In 2019, Otaola criticized the daughter of Raul Castro, Mariela Castro, for canceling the annual gay pride parade in Cuba and failing to protect gay rights activists from violence by Cuban security forces. On social media, Otaola has attempted to uncover Ciberclarias, which he claims are false profiles that spread propaganda for the Cuban government. On February 29, 2020, Otaola organized a Caravan in Calle Ocho, Miami, for the liberation of Cuba, the release of political prisoners in Cuba, and to support the Trump administration‚Äôs policies on Cuba. According to the Miami Herald, the caravan consisted in as many as 2,000 cars. Following the car caravan to condemn the Cuban regieme, Otaola congregated a second caravan to support Law and Order and peace. During the George Floyd protests, Otaola joined the BlackTuesday campaign on Instagram in support of black victims of police violence and added the hashtag #AllLivesMatter. Otaola said on his show: \\"If we are going to fight racism, it is not by segregating or separating into races that we are going to achieve it\\". He also said George Floyd's death was not justified and the police officer kneeling on his neck should be punished. He also expressed his belief that mainstream media and the left were trying to promote vandalism and portray Floyd like a hero.  Jos√© Daniel Ferrer  On his show, Otaola has demanded the release of political prisoner and human rights activist Jos√© Daniel Ferrer and founder of the human rights group the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU). In 2019, he called for a proof of life for Jos√© Daniel Ferrer. Otaola vigorously defended the human rights activist from allegations by a Cuban television station that Ferrer bashed his head against a desk in prison, he claimed the video was manipulated. Upon Ferrer's release to house arrest in 2020, Ferrer was interviewed on Hola Ota-Ola! and expressed gratitude toward the program for raising awareness to secure his release. Feuds= Descemer Bueno  In 2019, Otoala sued Descemer Bueno for defamation and it has resulted in an ongoing court battle.  Roberto F. Hidalgo Puentes  In May 2018, Otaola filed a police report which alleges that Roberto F. Hidalgo Puentes, half of the Cuban duo Yomil y Dany, assaulted him inside a store in Miami. In a statement to Mart√≠ Noticias, Otaola said this is not the first time he has been threatened by Hidalgo, and he alleges Hidalgo threatened to kill him during a event in Punta Cana. Hidalgo returned to Cuba after the incident. In 2018 according to Daniel Ben√≠tez of Am√©rica TeV√©, a Miami Dade judge signed an arrest warrant for Mr. Hidalgo.  5 de Septiembre Accusations  On January 10, 2020, Julio Mart√≠nez Molina published an article in the Cienfuego newspaper, 5 de Septiembre, which alleged that Alexander Otaola is accused of sexual abuse of a minor in Cuba. Otaola denies the allegation and has consulted with his legal team to request the retraction of that statement by the newspaper.  Chocolate MC  During an interview Chocolate MC walked out of the Hola Ota-Ola show. Since their initial meeting, Otaola and Chocolate MC have reconciled. Chocolate MC attended the Caravan in 2020.  Red List  On his show he has an ongoing list of Cuban artists, celebrities, and business people who collaborate with the Communist regime in Cuba while also possessing a green card in order to reside or work in the United States.  Personal Life = Relationships  According to an interview with Ileana Marce, Alexander Otaola is currently single.  Criticism = Boycotts  Critics have voiced concern about Otaola's advocacy for boycotting certain Cuban artists. Several Cuban-Americans who were interviewed by the Associated Press criticized the ban as an act of discrimination and censorship. However, the mayor of Miami Francis Xavier Suarez supported the ban stating: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about intolerance or censorship, it‚Äôs about respect and recognizing the mortifying history of communism, especially in Cuba‚Äù.  George Floyd protests  Some of Otaola's followers on Instagram expressed disappointment at his comments on the George Floyd protests. ‚ÄúYou were wrong when addressing the issue of racism. There is racism everywhere, but in the United States, the treatment of Blacks is extreme,‚Äù said an Instagram user with the handle @martilahabana. Otaola told the Herald he was \\"not a racist\\" and \\"did not focus on people‚Äôs skin color\\". He said he believed mainstream media and the left were trying to promote vandalism and portray Floyd like a hero.

Produced by Tommy Allsup at Mercury Custom Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, it was released in March 1973 as the group's only album on United Artists Records. The album features a variety of traditional and original compositions, including recordings of songs originally by Bob Wills, Hank Williams and Geoff Mack. Most of the original tracks on the album were written by drummer and vocalist LeRoy Preston. Asleep at the Wheel's debut was the only album to feature the first recording lineup of the group, which included Preston alongside vocalist and lead guitarist Ray Benson, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chris O'Connell, vocalist and bassist Gene Dobkin, steel guitarist Lucky Oceans and pianist Floyd Domino. At the time of its recording, the band did not have a full-time fiddler in the band, so Comin' Right at Ya features guest contributions from Johnny Gimble, Andy Stein and Buddy Spicher on the instrument. Comin' Right at Ya failed to register on the US or any international music charts. However, it was received positively by critics, with reviewers praising its versatility and authenticity considering the young age of the band. The album has since been recognised by a number of commentators as one of the best releases in Asleep at the Wheel's career. Two songs on the record were released as singles: Wills' \\"Take Me Back to Tulsa\\" in July 1973 and Jerry Irby's \\"Drivin' Nails in My Coffin\\" in October 1973. Background After performing for almost three years without a record deal, Asleep at the Wheel signed with United Artists Records in the fall of 1972. The impetus for the deal was credited in part to Van Morrison, who mentioned the group favorably in an interview with Rolling Stone, which led to interest from multiple labels. Despite being based in Oakland, California at the time, the band insisted that they be allowed to record their debut album in Nashville, Tennessee, inspired by Willie Nelson's recordings. Recording for the album took place at Nashville's Mercury Custom Recording Studios in January 1973. The sessions were produced by Tommy Allsup, who was brought in on the recommendation of fiddler Buddy Spicher, a guest performer on the album's first recording, \\"Take Me Back to Tulsa\\". As the band did not yet have a full-time fiddler, Comin' Right at Ya also featured contributions from Johnny Gimble and Andy Stein, the latter of whom had been touring part-time with the group since 1971. Comin' Right at Ya was released in March 1973. Two singles were issued from the album: a recording of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys' \\"Take Me Back to Tulsa\\" featuring Spicher, and a recording of Jerry Irby's \\"Drivin' Nails in My Coffin\\" featuring Gimble. Despite receiving several positive reviews from music critics after the release of the album, neither Comin' Right at Ya nor either of its singles managed to register on the national record charts, which led to United Artists dropping the band. Reception Critical response to Comin' Right at Ya was largely positive, with many commentators hailing it as a strong debut release. Writing in Record Mirror, Tony Byworth described the album as \\"an auspicious and highly entertaining recording debut in which this six piece outfit really come to grips with the honest to goodness country sounds of the fifties and early sixties.\\" Similarly, a short uncredited review in Billboard magazine stated: \\"San Francisco's hottest new neo-hayseed rockers join the Commander Cody/Dan Hicks sweepstake with delightfully wacked-out flair.\\" The Dispatch, a newspaper based in Moline, Illinois, wrote about the record that \\"it's unbelievable that a group so young can be so talented, they sound like they've been around for years,\\" calling it \\"a nearly flawless piece of vinyl\\". Several reviews welcomed Asleep at the Wheel's debut as an exciting development in country and western music. Byworth suggested that the band was \\"injecting the music with some good old basic enthusiasm and excitement\\". Cash Box was also positive of the potential impact of the album, suggesting that \\"Asleep At The Wheel looks to become an important force in the revitalization of western music\\". Music critic Robert Christgau spoke further about the album within the genre of Western swing specifically, writing that \\"flatness is of the essence in Western swing, and the sly singing and positively underhanded songwriting here exploit it brilliantly.\\" In another retrospective review, for the website AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that Comin' Right at Ya saw the group \\"re-creating the sound of pure country at a time when it often wasn't heard\\", calling it \\"one of their best\\" releases. Of the few criticisms levelled at Comin' Right at Ya, among the most common was its attempt at humorous material. The Arizona Republic published a review which stated that \\"Unlike Commander Cody, who seems to parody much of country and western music, Asleep at the Wheel seem dead serious in pushing these old songs, and while they do swing, most hard rock enthusiasts may find them a bit too corny.\\" The Times Herald drew the same comparison, claiming that \\"They are not as funny or as eclectic as Commander Cody, but are musically every bit as good.\\" Erlewine's review for AllMusic noted that \\"There's also a dash of post-hippie humor ... and just the slightest touch of knowingly reverent reserve ... [which] is the only area where the record stumbles, and it's a slight one\\".

Reprint, Minneapolis: Fortress) is a 1997 book by the Americans New Testament scholar from the University of Massachusetts Boston, Richard A. Horsley and Neil Asher Silberman, an archaeologist, historian and contributing editor to Archaeology Magazine. It is a historical account of Christianity in the 1st century that portrays the quest for the kingdom of God by Jesus, Paul, and the earliest churches as both a spiritual journey and a political response to the \\"mindless acts of violence, inequality, and injustice that characterized the kings of men.\\"The Message and the Kingdom, p. 7 Following the traditional prophetic pattern, Jesus pronounced God's judgment against the rulers in Jerusalem and their Roman patrons. This confrontation with the Jerusalem rulers and his martyrdom at the hands of the Roman governor, however, became the breakthrough that empowered the rapid expansion of his movement in the immediately ensuing decades. In Jerusalem the Twelve told of post death appearances of Jesus, which were seen as vindicating his cause as a righteous martyr, providing assurance of the victory over Rome and signalling the first step in the general resurrection ‚Äì the era of Israel‚Äôs salvation was already inaugurated. The values of the village renewal movement (sharing, reciprocity, independence) were applied to urban life and the Jerusalem community adopted the mission of extending the renewal to the diaspora communities. As the movement spread it also attracted non-Israelites who found in the Jesus movement an alternative community and identity. Saul/Paul of Tarsus had a vision that persuaded him to deliver Jesus‚Äô message throughout the Roman Empire. Paul created communities that rejected patron-client relationships as the paradigm for community and instead embodied the Spirit led ideals of mutual support, love and sharing. Paul‚Äôs communities focussed on Christ as the Lord whose resurrection made a mockery of Roman claims to power (crucifixion was Rome‚Äôs violent and public means of enforcing its rule, but Christ had proven greater than Rome) and who would soon return to destroy Roman power, judge the nations and establish God‚Äôs kingdom on earth. Paul‚Äôs collection for the famine stricken Judaean Christians was intended as a powerful expression of the independence from Roman rule that communal solidarity could bring for it would free Judaean Christians from dependence on wealthy patrons. The offering in Paul‚Äôs mind would fulfil the prophetic vision of representatives from all the nations bringing gifts to Jerusalem and would usher in the return of Christ. But rather than ushering in the return and reign of Christ, Paul‚Äôs journey to Jerusalem issued only in his death and the continued oppressive presence of Rome. In the tradition of S. G. F. Brandon, the authors argue that after the First Roman-Jewish War, the Christian movement began to adapt to the continued presence of Rome. The values of mutual support, love and sharing were embodied internally in the institutions of the Christian community but the State came to be seen as a power with which the Christian faith could coexist until the return of Christ, and by the 4th century State and Church were integrated. However, the quest for the Kingdom of God and the resistance to oppresion continued (and continues) to exist in Christianity.

Apart from a large number of salon pieces for the piano, he was also known as an accompanist to popular theatrical performances including puppet plays. Career Lamothe was born in Paris in 1842, the exact date cannot be established.Most sources, including the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, claim 1837 as his year of birth, which is based on Baker's Dictionary (1900 and 1919 editions). However, his death certificate states that he died aged 52, and the gravestone gives his year of birth as 1842. This consistent information means that he was born between 1 January and 14 October 1842; for the sources see \\"External links\\" below. Baker's Dictionary, which wrongly claims that he was born in 1837, also states that his work-list exceeded \\"over 1,000 op.-numbers\\".Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, 3rd edition revised by Alfred Remy (New York and Boston: G. Schirmer, 1919), p. 506. In contrast, the online catalogue of the French national library (Biblioth√®que nationale de France), counts 503 entries under his name, which also includes arrangements of Lamothe's works by other composers. The highest opus number in this catalogue is 310, but many other works are listed without opus numbers, and around 15 to 20 opus numbers have been allocated two or three works. The exact quantity of works aside, he certainly was a very productive composer, with his first publications appearing in 1861 when he was barely 19 years of age. His parents were Jean Paul √âmile Alexandre Lamothe, a lawyer, and Marie Madeleine D√©sir√©e, n√©e Chatelain.Information from death certificate. No information about his teachers or places of musical education has survived. He may have been a student of the Paris Conservatory, but his name is not included in publications that listed prize-winners of this institution. The contemporary French press often described him as an organist; for example, an 1881 issue of Le Figaro called him the \\"organist of Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain\\",Le Figaro, 31 October 1881, p. 1: \\"organiste de S. M. la Reine d‚ÄôEspagne\\". and, in fact, he received the title \\"Organiste de la Chambre royale de Sa Majest√© la reine Isabella II d'Espagne\\" in December 1878.L'Orchestre, December 1878. However, although he performed in Spain, he is not recorded as ever having spent any extended period of time at the Spanish court, so it must have been an honorary title only. Furthermore, this activity should not be confused with that of a church organist. Lamothe wrote for and performed on a portable \\"orgue expressif\\", better known as harmonium. On a number of public occasions, Lamothe promoted the products of the harmonium maker \\"Alexandre p√®re et fils\\", for example at the World Exposition (Exposition Universelle) in Paris of 1889.Le Monde illustr√©, 27 July 1889, p. 58. An 1882 newspaper notice mentions him as giving teaching courses on the \\"orgue-harmonium\\" in the Salons Mangeot, 21 avenue de l'Op√©ra, Paris.L'Orchestre, February 1882. As a performer on the piano and the harmonium, Lamothe enjoyed international popularity: besides performing all over France, in Spain and Portugal, he also toured through England in 1875Le M√©nestrel, 18 July 1875, p. 261. and the United States for two months in 1876.Le Monde artiste, 8 July 1876, p. 6 reports his departure, and the issue of 9 September, p. 8, his return. Incidental music and accompaniments Lamothe's main musical activity appears to have been writing and performing incidental music for theatrical productions, including puppet plays. In 1864, Lamothe became a member of \\"Les Pierrots\\", a Parisian group of artists convened by the actor Montrouge, alongside Jean-Fran√ßois Berthelier, Coquelin Cadet, Joseph Darcier, L√©on Fusier, F√©lix Galipaux, Eug√®ne Silvain, and others.Paulus: Trente ans de caf√©-concert, ed. by Octave Pradels (Paris, 1908), p. 307. He was also a member of the \\"Pupazzi\\" of Louis Lemercier de Neuville (1830‚Äì1918), a group of puppet players performing all over France. In Paris, these shows were frequently performed in the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin, with Lamothe being a close collaborator of its founder, the magician Jean- Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, for whose productions he was one of the accompanists on the piano. Compositions like La Malle des Indes, Op. 161 (1876) and Une Soir√©e chez Robert-Houdin (1890) are dedicated to Robert-Houdin. In his autobiography (1911), Lemercier de Neuville included a list of the accompanists that he worked with in the course of his career. It lists, among others, Georges Bizet, Charles Gounod, Gustave Nadaud, L√©o Delibes, Edmond Audran, and Georges Lamothe. As composers who wrote specific music for his plays he included, besides Lamothe, Charles Domergue de la Chauss√©e, Olivier M√©tra, √âmile Pessard, and Albert Renaud.Louis Lemercier de Neuville: Souvenirs d'un montreur de marionnettes (Paris: Maurice Bauche, 1911), p. 326‚Äì327; online at Gallica. Honours Apart from the title of the Queen of Spain's organist (1878), he was also decorated in Spain with the Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic.Le Monde artiste, 16 June 1877, p. 7. In 1879 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of Christ (from the King of Portugal, 1879),L'Orchestre, February 1879. and he received the Cross of the Order of Charles III (from the King of Spain, 1885).Le Figaro, 18 March 1885, p. 3. In France, he was named an \\"Officier de l'Instruction Publique\\" in January 1890, an honour bestowed by the French government on distinguished teachers, also known as \\"Golden Palms\\" of the Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques.Journal des d√©bats, 2 January 1890, p. 2. Death Lamothe died suddenly in Courbevoie, D√©partement Hauts-de-Seine, aged 52. According to the newspaper Le Figaro, he died from a stomach abscess; the music journal Le M√©nestrel reported that he had suffered for three days from an infectious stomach disease.Le Figaro, 16 Octobre 1894, p. 3; Le M√©nestrel, 21 October 1894, p. 336.

It is the graphic representation of the sonorous and motor aspects of the particular movements of flamenco dancing that are produced by the action of zapateado or foot-stomping.  History  There are different forms of dance notation. They are mainly based on movement and body positions. Zapateado is an element of some dances, and it has its own notation system. In flamenco dancing the notations for zapateado include the one created by Teresa Mart√≠nez de la Pe√±a, who was one of the first authors to include symbols for the notation of flamenco zapateado. In his book M√©todo pedag√≥gico de interacci√≥n m√∫sica/danza, Pedro Alarc√≥n also provided symbols for the notation of flamenco zapateado. Subsequently, in Figuras, pasos y mudanzas the authors Eulalia Pablo and Jose Lu√≠s Navarro proposed their own notation symbols. Rosa de las Heras proposes a notation system for flamenco zapateado in several audiovisual publications with scores (books, CD and DVD).  Notation symbols  In general, the notation of flamenco zapateado always uses five symbols for feet movements. Depending on the author, the name may vary, but it generally coincides with the movement. Some include additional symbols for the most specific movements. Mart√≠nez de la Pe√±a‚Äôs notation system comprises 5 basic symbols called tip, heel, ball, toe and scrape heel to represent the different forms in which the foot hits the floor. She adds the indications for right and left and numbers to indicate the flamenco tempos. Flamenco zapateado notation symbols for right foot and left foot. Flamenco zapateado notation proposed by Rosa De las Heras. Alarcon‚Äôs notation system includes three lines of percussion for three mechanisms of the foot: the top line, called ‚ÄúP‚Äù indicates the movement that he calls tip [punta in Spanish]; the ‚ÄúT‚Äù line is to indicate the movement he calls heel [tac√≥n in Spanish]; and the bottom line is ‚ÄúPL‚Äù to indicate the movement called ball [planta in Spanish]. Letters and numbers are added to this three-line score to indicate the other movements. In addition, the system includes explanations for the right and left feet. The rhythm is indicated by means of traditional Western musical notation. Pablo and Navarro‚Äôs notation proposes 5 basic symbols somewhat similar to the ones used by Mart√≠nez de la Pe√±a, although they add the word \\"stomp\\" to the names. Their system comprises additional symbols, including one for non-sonorous positions. De las Heras‚Äôs notation includes symbols of the foot as note heads. She uses 5 basic symbols called ball, half ball, tip, block heel and edge heel. She works with two lines of percussion: the right foot on the top percussion line and the left foot on the lower line. The rhythm is based on the traditional Western musical notation system, similar to percussion notation.

Daniel Smith is a longtime United States government administrator who is a former acting director of the United States National Park Service in the Trump administration.  Early life and military service  Smith was born in Maine. He served in the Vietnam War.  Career  From 1970 to 1975, Smith worked as a staff member for Senator Sam Ervin, Democrat of North Carolina. Smith was a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association from 1978 to 1980. Smith worked at the Department of the Interior in the Reagan administration from 1982 to 1986, first as deputy assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks, and then at the National Park Service as director of legislative and congressional affairs. He joined the General Services Administration in 1987 and worked there until 1997. Smith was superintendent of Colonial National Historical Park in Virginia from 2004 to his retirement in 2015. The park includes a 23-mile parkway and historic sites including Jamestown and Yorktown Battlefield. In 2004, Smith worked as a special assistant to National Park Service Director Fran P. Mainella. In that role, according to a 2006 inspector general report, Smith \\"unduly influenced\\" deliberations by officials at the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park in helping Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder cut down 130 trees on a Park Service-protected easement to improve his view of the Potomac River.  National Park Service acting director  In January 2018, Smith came out of retirement to rejoin the National Park Service as deputy director. Two weeks later, on January 24, 2018, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke named Smith as acting director of the National Park Service. During a government shutdown in January 2019, Smith announced that visitor fees typically saved for future projects would be used to keep the most visited national parks functioning instead. The Government Accountability Office concluded in September 2019 that this action broke federal spending law.  2026 Independence Day celebrations  On September 30, 2019, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt reassigned Smith to lead efforts to celebrate the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence on July 4, 2026.

He was never identified or captured. Early attacks On March 8, 1973, the offender convinced DMP, a girl, resident of Vila Prudente, to walk with him to a nearby apartment near Vergueiro street, where he promised a gift for her. But, inside the building, he attempted to rape her, whereupon she screamed for help and alarmed residents of the building. The attacker, fearing for his capture, threw the girl against the wall, injuring her.Monstro que ataca meninas continua solto. Pol√≠cia alerta a popula√ß√£o, Diario da Noite : Edi√ß√£o Matutina (April 27, 1973) Initially, three children were attacked by the Monster.Ca√ßa total ao Monstro que s√≥ ataca crian√ßas, Diario da Noite : Edi√ß√£o Matutina (April 25, 1973) On April 2, 1973, the child MPR, six-year-old, was waving to her father who was exiting his house, and stayed there for some minutes when someone said her father was waiting her at a nearby gas station. With the kidnapper and the child with hands together, with whom she walked from 400 meters. She then rapidly entered an apartment, going to the third floor, where the kidnapper raped her. Hours later, the girl was found by someone in the hallway. Rescued, she was taken to the Hospital das Clinicas. On April 23, 1973 at 4:30 p.m. six-year-old child AGS, daughter of AG and EVG, exited her house to visit a nearby bakery in Pari to buy roulade. About an hour later, her mother, concerned of her absence, went to search for her. She was informed that AGS did not visit the bakery and was not seen near it. Then, her mother went to look at neighbour houses, however, she could not find her daughter. She then contacted her spouse, AG, who just came from work. With the help of friends, parents and neighbours, they went for another search for the little girl. However, they still could not find her; it was the time they decided to inform a nearby police station about the little girl disappearance. Various RONE and ROTA police cars went to search for the girl, looking the Pari region, or attempted to have a lead to her disappearance. Then, a woman with a child in her arms, Maria Alves da Cruz, along with her spouse, Antonio Alves da Cruz, entered the police station and explained what occurred. According to Antonio Alves, while he was lying in his bed, and when a ring bell rang, her wife went to verify who was outside. But, before opening the door, she asked several times who was outside. She didn't hear a reply, however, she heard, a cry of low sound, of a child. She then alerted to her husband and he opened the door. The child, leaning against the wall, with her clothes covered in blood, semi-unconscious and almost falling down. The girl had a blond hair and had blue eyes, who attempted to cry but could not. Besides her, there was a piece of paper, who read: > I had much sorrow for her, because she is six-year-old. She does not even > know where she resides, this is why I write this below because this was > there where I got her and, kidnapped. Take her to the nearby police station > to them deliver her to her house. I can not say my name. Greetings.

Church on the end of the street Bar√£o de > Lad√°rio, in Bra... Dear young woman - please read this. I leave the child > with you. Take care of her and read the other part The police chief Waltrides Gon√ßalves Cyrino, seeing the state of the child, sent her to the Ipiranga PS, making contact immediately with the 30¬∫ Distrito Policial, to ask to them if there was a record for a missing girl. It was there that the facts then matched. The girl's parents were alarmed, arriving at the 26¬∫ Distrito, with enough time to watch their child in the Hospital das Clinicas, where the girl was taken seriously wounded. Later attacks Five- year-old PHMC, who had green eyes, also a resident of Vila Prudente, was playing outside her home when she saw a person (who matched the later description in the investigation) who told her to go with him at a nearby building, where her mother was waiting her. The girl then gave her hands with the unidentified person and walked with him to the apartment building. After raping the girl, he told her to see her mother, who supposedly was at the mentioned apartment. Crying and terrified, she went upstairs, while the offender walked out. Investigation The offender was being hunted by police officers H√©lio Braga, Waltride Cyrino as well as Jos√© Campanella. The attack on MPR was linked to that of AGS, and another on the street Cipriano Viana. Initially, they could not found if the attacker was black, or white, tall or short. But they later ascertained that he was a brown man, with no mustaches, with frizzy and long hair who wears red pants and a white shirt with several balls in it, has blue eyes, who always has a child aged 5 or 6 of green or blue eyes as his companion. Motorists, taxi and bus drivers, were alerted to identify the man who was accompanying the child. The offender may has used a vehicle to drive with his victims or walked in foot to apartments, where he would rape them. Although he had five confirmed victims, police suspected that over a dozen children were attacked by him. Police chief Aldo Gagliano as soon as he heard about the first case, he began an investigation concerning the attacker. Taxi driver Jos√© Manuel Correia de Almeida said that as he was to exit the Estrada das L√°grimas, in Alto do Sacom√£, received a sign to stop that was given by an unidentified person who had a girl with 6 years or lower. According to the de Almeida, the girl was the same one that was attacked by the offender who left a note confessing to the crime. He said that \\"I attempted to see the face of the man by the rear-view, but he hid himself in the car, making impending me from seeing his physiognomy. The child was crying and calling for her mother. To explain the child tears, the man said to me that he left his wife in S. Caetano, to where we went to. Near Avenida Almirante Delamare, he ordered to stop, and avoiding being seen by me, payed the ride and left the car with the child in his arms.\\" Police could not make MPR recognize the driver, because she was seriously injured in the hospital. There were several suspects arrested, including Pedro Batista dos Santos, resident of Nossa Senhora da Consolata. However, de Almeida said that dos Santos was not the man he gave a ride. Police chiefs who worked in the case include: Alberto Barbour, Aldo Gagliano, H√©lio Braga and Jos√© Campanella. They were also working in a police sketch. In a police lecture carried by phone by Campanella, Gagliano, Barbour, Braga and Cyrino regarding the letter and the part \\"because I live in Franco da Rocha\\" has made as a reference aiming at two things: as a red herring to the police or indicating that he had been a patient in the Hospital dos Alienados. The hospital theory was supported by the police officers, whereupon the police officers began to take investigation at the aforementioned hospital.Monstro que ataca meninas pode ser um egresso de hospital psiqui√°trico, Diario da Noite : Edi√ß√£o Matutina (April 28, 1973)Marginal misterioso ataca v√°rias crian√ßas em S.

Bydgoszcz or the Crumbling Castle.  History  Title Page of Geography Published in 1535 Askaukalis was one of the settlements in the Gothic (Gothic-Gepid) state, known in Polish archeology as Wielbark culture. This country was founded on the territory of today's Poland in the first century CE by East Germanic tribes.Ostoja-Zag√≥rski. About 150 A.D. A Greek mathematician and astronomer, Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria placed her on Magna Germania, the fourth map of Europe (ŒìŒµœÅŒºŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ∏Œ≠œÉŒπœÇ, Œï·ΩêœÅœéœÄŒ∑œÇ œÄŒØŒΩŒ±Œæ Œ¥¬¥,) one of the 26 maps included in the famous Geography (ŒìŒµœâŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫·Ω¥ ·ΩôœÜŒÆŒ≥Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ.) The ancient researcher himself did not participate in the cartographic measurements that was needed to create them. He owed most of the information to merchants traversing the lands that he was interested in and to military cartographers of the Roman Empire.  Research  Ptolemy, understandably, did not avoid errors resulting mainly from the need to transfer spherical reality to the map plane. He assumed that the countries between the Baltic Sea and the Danube were much narrower, which meant that places from such a distant past were extremely difficult to identify on modern maps. What's more, he was wrong in pointing out the location not only of places difficult to locate but also of such characteristic locations as, for example, Jutland or Schleswig-Holstein. At the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation at the Technical University of Berlin, a group of scientists consisting of classical philologists, mathematicians and cartographers made an attempt to correct these errors and developed the so-called \\"Geodetic deformation analysis.\\" On its basis, a list of cities (poleis) from Magna Germania was created with their assumed locations in today's Germany and Poland. According to Berlin scientists, these locations also correspond to archaeological sites in which Gothic settlements and burial sites were previously discovered. Also research in Bydgoszcz confirmed that in that period, due to its convenient location and easy crossing through the Brda, there was a significant development of settlements related to lively trade contacts with the Roman Empire through the Amber Road.Wilke pp. 49-71.Dygaszewicz pp. 55-62. Askaukalis was included in the so-called group 3, in which the settlements were located. Furthermore, settlements in this group were in the place of today's cities. However, as a result of mass migrations in the late antiquity they are not their direct precursors due to the lack of settlement continuity.Kleineberg et al.

Early life and education  Manning was born in California and grew up in inner city Los Angeles. In high school, Manning's father told her that, as a Black man in Alabama, people warned him that becoming a physician was not attainable. Hearing this story from her father motivated her to pursue a career in medicine. Following high school, Manning attended Tuskegee University in Alabama, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU) for her undergraduate education. Manning completed her pre-medical studies, and was a part of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority on campus. After completing her pre-medical studies in 1992, Manning was still set on a path to a career in medicine. She pursued her medical degree training at Meharry Medical College, also an HBCU. Upon completion of her M.D. in 1996, Manning attended one of Case Western‚Äôs affiliates, MetroHealth, for her residency training. She completed a combined internal medicine and pediatrics residency. In 2000, she was Chief Resident at Case Western Reserve University/MetroHealth and was selected by her classmates for an honorary membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.  Career  In 2001, Manning joined the Emory University School of Medicine faculty as a professor in the Department of Medicine. She has since become an Associate Professor of Medicine as well as the Associate Vice Chair of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Department of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. Her leadership led to the development of the strategic plan for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Emory University School of Medicine. She also led the Emory University Task force on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and has been a critical mentor and advocate for underrepresented minorities in medicine throughout her time at Emory. In addition to the roles she plays in enhancing diversity and equity at Emory, she is also a prominent educator, and is known nationally for her teaching at both the level of medical students as well as residents.

At the medical school level, Manning is an advisor for the Semmelweiss Society where she mentors and supports a small group of medical students throughout their time at Emory Medical School. She has been an advisor in this role since 2007. In addition to roles in promoting diversity and educating both pre-clinical students and residents, Manning also treats patients at Grady Memorial Hospital, one of the largest public hospitals in the United States.  Writing  Manning preaches humanism in medicine and teaches how reflective writing can be used consecutively for personal mental health and community building. She embodies both of her educational lessons by writing the blog ‚ÄúReflections of a Grady Doctor‚Äù to describe her personal experience in the medical field as a physician and educator at the Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Her blog was recognized by Oprah.com as one of the best Doctor‚Äôs Blogs in 2010. The practice of writing often, Grady calls ‚Äúhabitual reflection‚Äù and she teaches that it is vital in the practice of becoming a good doctor. As a Fellow of the American College of Physicians, Manning is also a weekly writer for the American College of Physicians Hospitalist Blog, sharing narratives of medical experiences on the wards and educating readers on key topics in medicine such as owning medical mistakes, imposter syndrome, and physician burnout. In addition to her blogging, Manning writes for several top tier journals and publishers including the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Annals of Internal Medicine, and Academic Medicine.

He was elected as one of the first mayors of the town of Bowen in the 1860s and later became mayor of the Mackay township. Wills is best known for his graphic depiction in his diary of his participation in a Native Police raid on a group of Aboriginal people near Bowen. In it he describes the shooting of these people and the kidnapping of the surviving children. Wills also gives a detailed account of how he dissected the body of one of the murdered Aboriginal men, took the bones back to Bowen and put them on display in order to raise funds for the hospital in that town. Wills' diary is considered an important document in the history of genocide in British colonial Australia. Early life Korah Halcomb Wills was born on 13 February 1828 in Dover, England to parents William Wills and Jane Horn. In the late 1840s he married Louisa Hunter also from Dover. Arrival in Australia In 1848, Wills emigrated to Australia with his wife, arriving in Adelaide in the British colony of South Australia in April 1849. In 1851 they moved to the British colony of Victoria where Wills became a gold miner at the diggings near Ballarat. The Wills' moved again in the late 1850s to the city of Melbourne where Wills established a butchery business on the corner of High Street and Brighton Road in St Kilda. He specialised in the breeding and slaughtering of prize-winning pigs and also became a member of the Volunteer Mounted Rifles. Mayor of Bowen In 1862, Wills decided to move with his young family north to the British colony of Queensland. A large farewell was organised in his honour at the Barkly Hotel in St Kilda where he was presented with a Terry breech-loading rifle. They arrived in Queensland and bought a town allotment in Bowen in the northern region of the colony. Wills quickly positioned himself in the local society by establishing two hotels and participating in a number of committees. Wills was elected an alderman of the town in 1864 and became a director of the local building society the following year. In 1866 he was elected Mayor of Bowen. Participation in Native Police raids, kidnap and butchery of a human corpse Around this time, Wills participated with the Native Police in a number of \\"dispersals\\" of local Aboriginal people. The Native Police were a government funded paramilitary force that were employed to conduct armed punitive expeditions against Indigenous Australians which usually resulted in massacre. Wills wrote in his diary that: > \\"many were the dispersing expeditions...

I shall never forget the > time when I first found the subject I intended to anatomize, when my friends > were looking on, and I commenced operations dissecting. I went to work > business-like to take off the head first, & then the Arms and then the legs, > and gathered them together and put them into my Pack saddle.\\" After butchering the corpse of the Aboriginal man, Wills placed the kidnapped girl on his horse and they rode back to Bowen: > \\"with my little protegee [sic] of a girl ‚Ä¶ who rode on the front of my > saddle... and crying nearly all the way... different people who hailed me > with how do and so on and where did you get that intelegent [sic] little > nigger from.\\" The girl later died of a respiratory illness. At an event to raise funds for the building of a hospital at Bowen, Wills decided to exhibit the remains of the Aboriginal man he had previously dissected. Wills took: > \\"my blackfellows [skull], arms and legs to the disgust of many. I remember I > had to cover them up with a flag, the Union Jack and if anyone wished to see > what was under that flag they had to ask the favor of one of the committee > who were afraid the Ladies might get a shock if they left it uncovered... it > was a grand success in a monetary point of view.\\" Historians have pointed out that even though some colonists thought Wills' actions were repulsive, he nevertheless remained in a position of high social standing. No thought was given to him or other participants being charged with any crime, showing that frontier colonial Queensland society had an ongoing acceptance of such activities. Mayor of Mackay In 1868, Wills left Bowen and established the Wills Hotel in Townsville. After a couple of years there, Wills moved to Mackay where he expanded his hotel business. Wills again became involved in the political society and was elected Mayor of Mackay in 1876 and 1877. He remained in Mackay until 1885 when his profitable career as a hotelier enabled him to retire back to England with his wife and younger children. Later life and family Wills spent his retirement in his comfortable home on Esmond Road in the London suburb of Bedford Park. He was able to continue to socialise with other British colonists of Australia at the Queensland Club in London. He died at his home on 7 December 1896. One of his daughters, Georgiana Jane Wills married the well-known banker and sugar planter Henry Brandon. Another daughter, Cora Louisa Wills, married Captain William Rosengren, who was one of Queensland's most active blackbirders of South Sea Islander labour.

His laboratory specializes in developing synthetic methods for chemical synthesis of proteins with post-translational modifications (PTMs) in quantities that allow for them to be studied thoroughly. Brik's group is developing novel modulators based on small molecules, peptides and peptidomimetics, to influence enzymes (such as deubiquitinases) and proteins involved in various diseases. With the help of these tools, it is possible to understand how molecules and biological systems affect health. Early life and education Brik, one of ten children, was born and raised in Abu Snan in northern Israel. He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, a master's degree in chemistry from the Technion. He studied for his doctoral degree, in which he focused on research of chemical synthesis of proteins, from a joint course of the Technion and the Scripps Research Institute under the mentorship of Professor Chi-Huey Wong. Brik authored the thesis ‚ÄúDesign and Synthesis of Novel Catalytic Proteins Based on Polypeptide Scaffolds‚Äù, under the supervision of professor Ehud Keinan (Technion) and professor Phillip Dawson (The Scripps Research Institute). He was promoted to senior researcher in 2004. He developed the synthesis of glycoproteins. In addition, Brik was involved in projects related to the discovery of inhibitors of various enzymes such as HIV protease. Career In 2007 Brik joined the Department of Chemistry of Ben Gurion University of the Negev. In 2011 he was promoted to associate professor and in 2012 to full professor. In 2014, Brik moved to the Technion Institute of Technology, where he holds the Jordan and Irene Tark Chair. Brik has coauthored more than 120 publications in key periodicals: Science, Nature Chemistry, Nature Chemical Biology, Nature Protocols, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Angewandte Chemie, Chemical Society Reviews, Chemical Science and others. Brik is a member of advisory and editing boards of a number of periodicals, including Cell Chemical Biology, ChemBioChem and Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry. He has also registered 6 patents. The research efforts of Brik's group are budgeted by many foundations, including the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Program, which recently awarded him the ERC Advanced Grant. Research Posttranslational modification of proteins affects protein structure, function, stability and sub-cellular localization, making the process crucial to health and disease. Yet understanding the effects of these modifications at the molecular level has been hindered by the lack of homogeneously modified proteins obtained via traditional biochemical and molecular biology approaches. Moreover, the preparation of such complex bioconjugates at workable quantities is highly demanding. Recent advances in protein chemistry applying chemical and semisynthetic approaches are becoming increasingly beneficial to overcome these challenges. The Brik lab has been developing novel synthetic methods to prepare site-specifically modified proteins for biochemical, biophysical and functional analyses. The Brik group is one of world leaders in devising new methods to prepare ubiquitin-based conjugates necessary for detailed studies on ubiquitin signaling. Ubiquitination is the cellular process where the 76 amino acid ubiquitin protein, or a polyubiquitin chain, is linked to a protein target, affecting a variety of biological processes such as protein degradation, trafficking, transcription and the DNA damage response. Not surprisingly, ubiquitination plays a key role in various diseases, such as neurological disorders, infectious diseases and cancer. In the face of challenges in producing ubiquitin conjugates using traditional molecular biology and enzymatic approaches, the Brik lab has developed a number of novel chemical methods for the preparation of large quantities of highly homogeneous and pure ubiquitin conjugates which have shed light on the mechanisms of ubiquitin signaling and enabled the discovery of novel modulators for the enzymes involved these processes.

It holds a prominent position in the town's central Conservation Area overlooking the town. It is a Grade-II listed building. It was built from 1864 to 1866 as the first-class Buxton Hotel on the hill next to Buxton's two new railway stations. It cost ¬£50,000 to build and had 105 rooms, a grand ballroom and 5 acres of landscaped gardens with croquet lawns and a tennis court. After its construction, the venture was liquidated and the hotel was auctioned in November 1867 at the Waterloo Hotel in Manchester. It was bought for ¬£20,000 by a consortium including several of the original investors, the Duke of Devonshire and with the LNWR railway company as a major shareholder. It opened as the Palace Hotel in May 1868. It was the largest hotel in Buxton until the luxury Empire Hotel with 300 rooms was opened in 1903 (although the Empire never reopened after World War I and was demolished in 1964). alt= The three- storey Palace Hotel is built of millstone grit stone and was designed in the style of a French ch√¢teau (with a Mansard roof with iron ridge railings and a central tower) by Henry Currey. Currey was the 7th Duke of Devonshire's architect and he also designed Buxton's St Ann's Well of 1852, Thermal Baths, Natural Baths, Pump Room, Market Hall, Holy Trinity Church, Congregational Church, Devonshire Park Chapel, Christchurch at Burbage, Wye House Asylum and Corbar Hall. Fellow architect Robert Rippon Duke was the Clerk of Works for the hotel's construction and he designed the grand marble-decorated extensions to the building in 1887, including a large new dining room at the rear and a new west wing. The hotel was an annexe to the Granville Military Hospital during World War I and used to billet British soldiers and later as a discharge centre for Canadian soldiers. After World War II (when the hotel was used as offices for the British civil service) the Palace Hotel was reopened by the Hewlett family, who also ran the Spa Plaza Hotel (formerly the Buxton Hydropathic). The red neon PALACE HOTEL sign on the tower is a distinctive sight in the town. Football teams including Manchester United, Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Southampton stayed at the Palace Hotel in the 1950s as a health resort. George Bernard Shaw, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and Margaret Thatcher are some of the famous guests who stayed at the hotel. The hotel is now part of the Britannia Hotels group and it has a spa, gym, indoor pool and conference rooms.
